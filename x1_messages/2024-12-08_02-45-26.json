        "content": "So the problem is that a group of friends is sharing the cost of a $50 gift for their teacher, and each friend contributes $5. We need to find out how many friends are in the group.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. It seems like a straightforward division problem. The total cost is $50, and each friend pays $5. So, to find out how many friends there are, I should divide the total cost by the amount each one contributes.\n\nSo, that's 50 divided by 5. Let me do that:\n\n50 \u00f7 5 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 friends in the group.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. If there are 10 friends and each contributes $5, then the total would be 10 times 5, which is 50. Yeah, that matches the total cost.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication. If we let the number of friends be x, then 5x = 50. Solving for x, we get x = 50 \u00f7 5, which again is 10.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about it in terms of addition. If each friend contributes $5, how many 5's do we need to add up to 50? Well, 5 + 5 is 10, 10 + 5 is 15, and so on, until we reach 50. Let's see:\n\n5 (1 friend), 10 (2 friends), 15 (3), 20 (4), 25 (5), 30 (6), 35 (7), 40 (8), 45 (9), 50 (10). So, again, 10 friends.\n\nDoes that make sense? It seems consistent across different methods. I don't think there's any trick here or additional considerations. The problem is pretty straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there were any other costs or if the contributions were unequal, but the problem states that each friend contributes $5, and the total is $50. So, no need to overcomplicate it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10 friends.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
