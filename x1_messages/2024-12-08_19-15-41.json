        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 5 barbers in a town, each with a different number of customers. The most popular barber has twice as many customers as the second most popular one, and the total number of customers across all barbers is 124. We need to find out how many customers the least popular barber has.\n\nFirst, since each barber has a different number of customers, we can represent the number of customers each barber has as distinct variables. Let's denote them as \\( a, b, c, d, e \\), where \\( a > b > c > d > e \\), assuming they are ordered from the most popular to the least popular.\n\nGiven that the most popular barber has twice as many customers as the second most popular, we can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[ a = 2b \\]\n\nAlso, the total number of customers is 124:\n\n\\[ a + b + c + d + e = 124 \\]\n\nNow, since all the barbers have different numbers of customers, and they are ordered by popularity, we can assume that each subsequent barber has fewer customers than the previous one.\n\nOur goal is to find the value of \\( e \\), the least popular barber's customers.\n\nLet's see if we can express all variables in terms of one variable to solve for \\( e \\).\n\nStarting with \\( a = 2b \\), we can try to express \\( b \\) in terms of another variable, but it's not immediately clear. Maybe it's better to consider that there are five distinct positive integers in descending order that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume specific values for \\( b \\) and see what \\( a \\) would be, then adjust the other variables accordingly to see if they add up to 124.\n\nWait, that might be too trial-and-error. Let's try a more systematic approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that \\( a = 2b \\). Then, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[ 2b + b + c + d + e = 124 \\]\n\n\\[ 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\]\n\nNow, since \\( b > c > d > e \\), and all are positive integers, we need to find values that fit this equation.\n\nPerhaps we can express \\( c, d, e \\) in terms of \\( b \\) as well, but we don't have direct relationships given. Maybe we can assume that the differences between their customer numbers are constant, like in an arithmetic sequence. That might simplify things.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the numbers of customers form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference \\( k \\). So, we can express the numbers as:\n\n\\[ a, a - k, a - 2k, a - 3k, a - 4k \\]\n\nGiven that \\( a = 2b \\), and \\( b = a - k \\), so \\( b = a - k \\). But since \\( a = 2b \\), substituting back:\n\n\\[ a = 2(a - k) \\]\n\n\\[ a = 2a - 2k \\]\n\n\\[ -a = -2k \\]\n\n\\[ a = 2k \\]\n\nSo, \\( k = \\frac{a}{2} \\)\n\nNow, expressing all terms in terms of \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a, a - \\frac{a}{2}, a - 2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2}, a - 3\\cdot\\frac{a}{2}, a - 4\\cdot\\frac{a}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ a, \\frac{a}{2}, 0, -\\frac{a}{2}, -a \\]\n\nWait a minute, this can't be right because the number of customers can't be zero or negative. So, perhaps the assumption of an arithmetic sequence isn't appropriate here.\n\nLet\u2019s try another approach.\n\nSince \\( a = 2b \\), and \\( b > c > d > e \\), let's express the sum again:\n\n\\[ a + b + c + d + e = 124 \\]\n\n\\[ 2b + b + c + d + e = 124 \\]\n\n\\[ 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\]\n\nNow, since \\( b > c > d > e \\), and all are positive integers, let's consider that the differences between them are at least 1.\n\nSo, \\( c \\geq b - 1 \\), \\( d \\geq c - 1 \\geq b - 2 \\), and \\( e \\geq d - 1 \\geq b - 3 \\).\n\nWait, actually, since they all have different numbers of customers, the differences should be at least 1.\n\nSo, \\( c \\leq b - 1 \\), \\( d \\leq c - 1 \\leq b - 2 \\), and \\( e \\leq d - 1 \\leq b - 3 \\).\n\nBut actually, since \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), and \\( e < d \\), all being distinct positive integers.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find possible integer values for \\( b \\) such that \\( 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\), with \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), and all positive integers.\n\nThis seems a bit too vague. Maybe we need to consider the maximum possible value for \\( b \\).\n\nGiven that \\( a = 2b \\), and \\( a \\) is the largest, \\( a + b + c + d + e = 124 \\), with \\( a > b > c > d > e \\).\n\nLet\u2019s try to find the maximum possible \\( b \\). If \\( b \\) is too large, then \\( a = 2b \\) would be very large, and the sum might exceed 124.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( b \\) is too small, the sum might not reach 124.\n\nLet\u2019s try to estimate the range for \\( b \\).\n\nSince \\( a = 2b \\), and \\( a + b + c + d + e = 124 \\), we have \\( 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\).\n\nAlso, since \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers, the smallest possible values for \\( c, d, e \\) would be \\( b - 1, b - 2, b - 3 \\), assuming they decrease by 1 each time.\n\nSo, the minimal sum for \\( c + d + e \\) is \\( (b - 1) + (b - 2) + (b - 3) = 3b - 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( 3b + c + d + e \\geq 3b + (3b - 6) = 6b - 6 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\), and \\( 6b - 6 \\leq 124 \\), so \\( 6b \\leq 130 \\), hence \\( b \\leq \\frac{130}{6} \\approx 21.666 \\), so \\( b \\leq 21 \\).\n\nSimilarly, the maximal sum for \\( c + d + e \\) would occur when \\( c, d, e \\) are as large as possible, but since \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), the largest possible values would be \\( c = b - 1 \\), \\( d = c - 1 = b - 2 \\), \\( e = d - 1 = b - 3 \\), which is the same as before.\n\nWait, actually, to maximize \\( c + d + e \\), we need to maximize \\( c, d, e \\), which would be \\( c = b - 1 \\), \\( d = c - 1 = b - 2 \\), \\( e = d - 1 = b - 3 \\), so the maximal sum is also \\( 3b - 6 \\).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, in this case, the minimal sum of \\( c + d + e \\) is \\( 3b - 6 \\), as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, \\( 3b + c + d + e \\geq 3b + (3b - 6) = 6b - 6 \\leq 124 \\), so \\( 6b \\leq 130 \\), \\( b \\leq 21.666 \\), hence \\( b \\leq 21 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( b \\) must be large enough that \\( a = 2b \\) is still less than the total sum.\n\nLet\u2019s find the minimal possible \\( b \\). If \\( b \\) is too small, \\( a = 2b \\) might not leave enough room for \\( c, d, e \\) to be positive integers less than \\( b \\).\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( b = 1 \\), then \\( a = 2 \\), but then \\( c, d, e \\) would need to be less than 1, which isn't possible for positive integers. So, \\( b \\geq 2 \\).\n\nWait, but if \\( b = 2 \\), then \\( a = 4 \\), and \\( c, d, e \\) would need to be less than 2, so they could be 1, but all must be distinct, which is not possible since there are three of them. So, \\( b \\geq 3 \\).\n\nIf \\( b = 3 \\), \\( a = 6 \\), then \\( c, d, e \\) could be 2, 1, 0, but 0 is not a positive integer. So, \\( b \\geq 4 \\).\n\nIf \\( b = 4 \\), \\( a = 8 \\), then \\( c, d, e \\) could be 3, 2, 1, which are positive integers and distinct.\n\nLet\u2019s check if this sums to 124: \\( 8 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 18 \\), which is way less than 124.\n\nSo, \\( b \\) must be larger. Let's try \\( b = 21 \\), the upper limit we found earlier.\n\nIf \\( b = 21 \\), \\( a = 42 \\), then \\( c + d + e = 124 - 42 - 21 = 61 \\).\n\nNow, \\( c < 21 \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers.\n\nThe maximal sum for \\( c + d + e \\) would be if \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 19 \\), \\( e = 18 \\), summing to 57, which is less than 61. So, \\( b = 21 \\) is too large.\n\nWait, but 20 + 19 + 18 = 57, which is less than 61, meaning that with \\( b = 21 \\), \\( c + d + e = 61 \\), but the maximum possible is 57. Therefore, \\( b = 21 \\) is too large.\n\nThis suggests that our earlier assumption that \\( b \\leq 21 \\) might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the upper limit for \\( b \\).\n\nLet me revisit that.\n\nWe have \\( 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\), with \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers.\n\nThe minimal sum for \\( c + d + e \\) is \\( 3b - 6 \\), as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, \\( 3b + (3b - 6) = 6b - 6 \\leq 124 \\), hence \\( 6b \\leq 130 \\), \\( b \\leq 21.666 \\), so \\( b \\leq 21 \\).\n\nBut when \\( b = 21 \\), \\( c + d + e = 124 - 3(21) = 124 - 63 = 61 \\), but the maximum possible sum for \\( c + d + e \\) is \\( 20 + 19 + 18 = 57 \\), which is less than 61. This means that \\( b = 21 \\) is too large.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there is no integer solution, or maybe I need to reconsider the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers aren't in an arithmetic sequence, and there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet\u2019s try to express \\( c, d, e \\) in terms of \\( b \\).\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( c = b - x \\), \\( d = b - y \\), \\( e = b - z \\), where \\( x, y, z \\) are positive integers and \\( x < y < z \\), since \\( c > d > e \\).\n\nThen, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[ a + b + c + d + e = 2b + b + (b - x) + (b - y) + (b - z) = 5b - (x + y + z) = 124 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 5b - (x + y + z) = 124 \\]\n\nNow, since \\( x, y, z \\) are positive integers with \\( x < y < z \\), the minimal possible sum for \\( x + y + z \\) is \\( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\), and there's no upper limit except that \\( b - z \\) must be at least 1, since \\( e \\) is a positive integer.\n\nSo, \\( b - z \\geq 1 \\), which implies \\( z \\leq b - 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( x + y + z \\geq 6 \\), and \\( x + y + z \\leq (b - 3) + (b - 2) + (b - 1) = 3b - 6 \\).\n\nWait, but \\( x, y, z \\) represent the differences from \\( b \\), not their own values.\n\nActually, since \\( c = b - x \\), \\( d = b - y \\), \\( e = b - z \\), with \\( x < y < z \\), and all are positive integers, then \\( x \\geq 1 \\), \\( y \\geq 2 \\), \\( z \\geq 3 \\), assuming the minimal differences.\n\nTherefore, \\( x + y + z \\geq 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\), and \\( x + y + z \\leq \\) something dependent on \\( b \\).\n\nFrom the equation \\( 5b - (x + y + z) = 124 \\), we can express \\( x + y + z = 5b - 124 \\).\n\nSince \\( x + y + z \\) must be a positive integer (as \\( x, y, z \\) are positive integers), we have \\( 5b - 124 > 0 \\), so \\( b > \\frac{124}{5} = 24.8 \\). Therefore, \\( b \\geq 25 \\).\n\nWait a minute, this is conflicting with our earlier conclusion that \\( b \\leq 21 \\). There must be an error here.\n\nLet me double-check the earlier steps.\n\nWe had \\( 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\), and assuming \\( c = b - x \\), \\( d = b - y \\), \\( e = b - z \\), then the sum becomes:\n\n\\[ a + b + c + d + e = 2b + b + (b - x) + (b - y) + (b - z) = 5b - (x + y + z) = 124 \\]\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, \\( x + y + z = 5b - 124 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( x + y + z \\geq 6 \\) (from \\( x \\geq 1 \\), \\( y \\geq 2 \\), \\( z \\geq 3 \\)), we have:\n\n\\[ 5b - 124 \\geq 6 \\]\n\n\\[ 5b \\geq 130 \\]\n\n\\[ b \\geq 26 \\]\n\nAlso, since \\( e = b - z \\geq 1 \\), \\( z \\leq b - 1 \\), so \\( x + y + z \\leq 1 + 2 + (b - 1) = b + 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( 5b - 124 \\leq b + 2 \\)\n\n\\[ 5b - b \\leq 124 + 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 4b \\leq 126 \\]\n\n\\[ b \\leq 31.5 \\]\n\nSince \\( b \\) must be an integer, \\( b \\leq 31 \\).\n\nSo, combining \\( b \\geq 26 \\) and \\( b \\leq 31 \\), possible values for \\( b \\) are 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.\n\nNow, let's test these values to see which one fits.\n\nStarting with \\( b = 26 \\):\n\n\\[ x + y + z = 5(26) - 124 = 130 - 124 = 6 \\]\n\nThe minimal sum is also 6, which occurs when \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 2 \\), \\( z = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( c = 26 - 1 = 25 \\), \\( d = 26 - 2 = 24 \\), \\( e = 26 - 3 = 23 \\).\n\nNow, check if \\( a + b + c + d + e = 2(26) + 26 + 25 + 24 + 23 = 52 + 26 + 25 + 24 + 23 = 150 \\), which is more than 124. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier equation, \\( 5b - (x + y + z) = 124 \\), and with \\( b = 26 \\), \\( x + y + z = 6 \\), so \\( 5(26) - 6 = 130 - 6 = 124 \\), which matches.\n\nBut when I add them up, \\( a + b + c + d + e = 52 + 26 + 25 + 24 + 23 = 150 \\), which is more than 124. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating \\( a \\). Given \\( a = 2b = 52 \\), and \\( b = 26 \\), \\( c = 25 \\), \\( d = 24 \\), \\( e = 23 \\), the sum is indeed 150, not 124. So, there's an inconsistency.\n\nMaybe the assumption that \\( c = b - x \\), \\( d = b - y \\), \\( e = b - z \\) isn't accurate, or perhaps there's a different relationship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the barbers don't have customer numbers in such a tight sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the barbers have distinct positive integer numbers of customers, with \\( a = 2b \\), and \\( a > b > c > d > e \\).\n\nLet\u2019s try to minimize \\( b \\) and see if we can find integer solutions.\n\nFrom earlier, \\( b \\geq 26 \\), but when \\( b = 26 \\), the sum exceeds 124, which suggests that perhaps there is no solution with these constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the barbers have customer numbers that aren't so close to each other.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the differences between the barbers' customer numbers aren't necessarily minimal.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( b = 25 \\):\n\nThen, \\( a = 50 \\), and \\( c + d + e = 124 - 50 - 25 = 49 \\).\n\nNow, \\( c < 25 \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers.\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can find such \\( c, d, e \\) that sum to 49.\n\nIf \\( c = 24 \\), \\( d = 23 \\), \\( e = 22 \\), sum is 69, which is too high.\n\nIf \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 14 \\), sum is 49.\n\nBut 20, 15, 14 are not in strictly decreasing order by 1, but that's fine as long as they are distinct and in decreasing order.\n\nSo, one possible solution is \\( a = 50 \\), \\( b = 25 \\), \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 14 \\), sum is 50 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 14 = 124.\n\nThis satisfies all the conditions: \\( a = 2b \\), all distinct, sum to 124.\n\nTherefore, the least popular barber has 14 customers.\n\nWait, but is this the only solution? Let's check \\( b = 26 \\):\n\n\\( a = 52 \\), \\( c + d + e = 124 - 52 - 26 = 46 \\).\n\nPossible \\( c, d, e \\) such that \\( c < 26 \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), and sum to 46.\n\nFor example, \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), sum is 46.\n\nAnother possible solution: \\( a = 52 \\), \\( b = 26 \\), \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), sum is 124.\n\nSo, in this case, the least popular barber has 11 customers.\n\nBut earlier with \\( b = 25 \\), \\( e = 14 \\), and now with \\( b = 26 \\), \\( e = 11 \\). So, different values for \\( e \\).\n\nThis suggests that there might be multiple solutions, which contradicts the idea of a unique answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to ensure that all barbers have different numbers of customers. In the first case with \\( b = 25 \\), \\( e = 14 \\), and in the second with \\( b = 26 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), both sets are distinct.\n\nIs there a constraint that the differences must be more than 1? Wait, no, just that the numbers are different, not necessarily consecutive.\n\nSo, perhaps there are multiple valid solutions, but the problem seems to expect a single answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to find the minimal possible \\( e \\), but the problem just asks for the number of customers the least popular barber has, implying there is a specific answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the differences between the barbers are more than 1, to ensure distinctness.\n\nWait, no, the problem only states that each barber has a different number of customers, without specifying the magnitude of the differences.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there isn't a unique solution, which seems problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to assume that the differences are exactly 1, but that leads to the earlier contradiction where the sum exceeds or doesn't meet 124.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the barbers' customer numbers are in an arithmetic sequence, but as before, that led to negative values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up equations and solve for integer solutions.\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( a = 2b \\), and \\( a + b + c + d + e = 124 \\), with \\( a > b > c > d > e \\), all positive integers.\n\nThen, \\( 2b + b + c + d + e = 124 \\), so \\( 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers.\n\nLet\u2019s express \\( c, d, e \\) in terms of \\( b \\).\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( c = b - x \\), \\( d = c - y = b - x - y \\), \\( e = d - z = b - x - y - z \\), where \\( x, y, z \\) are positive integers.\n\nThen, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[ 3b + (b - x) + (b - x - y) + (b - x - y - z) = 124 \\]\n\n\\[ 3b + b - x + b - x - y + b - x - y - z = 124 \\]\n\n\\[ 5b - 3x - 2y - z = 124 \\]\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the sum of the five distinct positive integers is 124, with the largest being twice the second largest.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the five numbers are distinct positive integers in decreasing order: \\( a > b > c > d > e \\), with \\( a = 2b \\), and \\( a + b + c + d + e = 124 \\).\n\nLet\u2019s try to find possible values for \\( b \\) and see what \\( e \\) would be.\n\nFrom earlier, \\( b \\) must be at least 26, and at most 31.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( b = 26 \\):\n\nThen, \\( a = 52 \\), and \\( c + d + e = 124 - 52 - 26 = 46 \\).\n\nNow, \\( c < 26 \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers.\n\nPossible sets for \\( c, d, e \\):\n\n- \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), sum is 46.\n\n- \\( c = 18 \\), \\( d = 17 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), sum is 46.\n\n- \\( c = 25 \\), but \\( c < 26 \\), but \\( c \\) must be less than \\( b = 26 \\), so \\( c \\leq 25 \\).\n\nWait, but \\( c \\) must be less than \\( b = 26 \\), so \\( c \\leq 25 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( d \\leq 24 \\), \\( e \\leq 23 \\), but their sum must be 46.\n\nSo, possible combinations could be:\n\n- \\( c = 25 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 6 \\), sum is 46.\n\n- \\( c = 24 \\), \\( d = 18 \\), \\( e = 14 \\), sum is 56, which is too high.\n\nWait, 24 + 18 + 14 = 56, which is more than 46.\n\nWait, perhaps \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), sum is 46.\n\nAlternatively, \\( c = 25 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 6 \\), sum is 46.\n\nBoth are valid, but in the first case, \\( e = 11 \\), in the second, \\( e = 6 \\).\n\nSo, depending on the choices of \\( c, d, e \\), \\( e \\) can be different values.\n\nThis suggests that there isn't a unique solution for \\( e \\), which is problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the minimal possible \\( e \\), or perhaps there is a constraint I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the differences between the barbers' customer numbers are equal, but that led to negative values earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the barbers' customer numbers are in a geometric sequence, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the sum of the customer numbers is 124, with the largest being twice the second largest, and all distinct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the sum of the three least popular barbers is 124 - a - b = 124 - 2b - b = 124 - 3b.\n\nGiven that \\( c + d + e = 124 - 3b \\), and \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers.\n\nTo maximize \\( e \\), we need to minimize \\( c + d + e \\), but since \\( c, d, e \\) are distinct and decreasing, the minimal sum is when \\( c = b - 1 \\), \\( d = b - 2 \\), \\( e = b - 3 \\), summing to \\( 3b - 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( 124 - 3b \\geq 3b - 6 \\), which simplifies to \\( 124 + 6 \\geq 6b \\), or \\( 130 \\geq 6b \\), so \\( b \\leq 21.666 \\), hence \\( b \\leq 21 \\).\n\nBut earlier, when \\( b = 21 \\), \\( a = 42 \\), and \\( c + d + e = 124 - 42 - 21 = 61 \\), but the maximal sum for \\( c + d + e \\) when \\( b = 21 \\) is \\( 20 + 19 + 18 = 57 \\), which is less than 61. So, \\( b = 21 \\) is too large.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there is no solution, or perhaps I need to reconsider the approach entirely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the barbers don't have customer numbers in such close proximity, and larger differences are allowed.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( b = 20 \\):\n\nThen, \\( a = 40 \\), and \\( c + d + e = 124 - 40 - 20 = 64 \\).\n\nNow, \\( c < 20 \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers.\n\nPossible \\( c, d, e \\): \\( c = 19 \\), \\( d = 18 \\), \\( e = 17 \\), sum is 54, which is less than 64.\n\nAlternatively, \\( c = 15 \\), \\( d = 10 \\), \\( e = 39 \\), but \\( e = 39 \\) is larger than \\( d = 10 \\), which violates the order.\n\nWait, \\( e \\) must be less than \\( d \\), which must be less than \\( c \\).\n\nAlternatively, \\( c = 16 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 33 \\), again, \\( e > d \\), which is invalid.\n\nIt seems challenging to find values that satisfy all conditions with \\( b = 20 \\).\n\nAlternatively, \\( b = 19 \\):\n\n\\( a = 38 \\), \\( c + d + e = 124 - 38 - 19 = 67 \\).\n\nNow, \\( c < 19 \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), positive integers.\n\nPossible \\( c, d, e \\): \\( c = 18 \\), \\( d = 17 \\), \\( e = 16 \\), sum is 51, which is less than 67.\n\nAlternatively, \\( c = 15 \\), \\( d = 10 \\), \\( e = 42 \\), but again, \\( e > d \\), invalid.\n\nThis suggests that \\( b \\) cannot be 19.\n\nAlternatively, \\( b = 22 \\):\n\n\\( a = 44 \\), \\( c + d + e = 124 - 44 - 22 = 58 \\).\n\nPossible \\( c, d, e \\): \\( c = 21 \\), \\( d = 20 \\), \\( e = 17 \\), sum is 58.\n\nThis satisfies \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), and sum is 58.\n\nTherefore, one possible solution is \\( a = 44 \\), \\( b = 22 \\), \\( c = 21 \\), \\( d = 20 \\), \\( e = 17 \\), sum is 124.\n\nIn this case, the least popular barber has 17 customers.\n\nBut earlier, with \\( b = 20 \\), it was difficult to find valid \\( c, d, e \\), and with \\( b = 26 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), and with \\( b = 25 \\), \\( e = 14 \\), and with \\( b = 22 \\), \\( e = 17 \\).\n\nThis suggests that \\( e \\) can take on different values depending on the choice of \\( b \\), which seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is only one valid solution where all conditions are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the differences between the barbers' customer numbers are not minimal, allowing for larger gaps, which would allow for different values of \\( e \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have multiple solutions, and I need to find one possible value for \\( e \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique solution that I haven't found yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to approach this problem differently, perhaps by considering the average number of customers per barber.\n\nThe average number of customers per barber is \\( \\frac{124}{5} = 24.8 \\).\n\nGiven that, the most popular barber has twice as many as the second most popular, so \\( a = 2b \\).\n\nIf \\( b \\) is around 25, then \\( a = 50 \\), which is above the average, and the other barbers have fewer customers.\n\nBut as we've seen, this leads to different possible values for \\( e \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the total sum minus \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and see what's left for \\( c, d, e \\).\n\nGiven \\( a + b + c + d + e = 124 \\), and \\( a = 2b \\), then \\( 2b + b + c + d + e = 124 \\), so \\( 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers, we can try to express \\( c, d, e \\) in terms of \\( b \\).\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( c = b - k \\), \\( d = b - m \\), \\( e = b - n \\), where \\( k, m, n \\) are positive integers with \\( k < m < n \\).\n\nThen, \\( 3b + (b - k) + (b - m) + (b - n) = 124 \\), which simplifies to \\( 5b - (k + m + n) = 124 \\).\n\nNow, since \\( k, m, n \\) are positive integers with \\( k < m < n \\), the minimal sum for \\( k + m + n \\) is \\( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\), and the maximal sum depends on \\( b \\).\n\nGiven that, \\( 5b - (k + m + n) = 124 \\), so \\( 5b - 124 = k + m + n \\).\n\nSince \\( k + m + n \\geq 6 \\), we have \\( 5b - 124 \\geq 6 \\), which implies \\( 5b \\geq 130 \\), so \\( b \\geq 26 \\).\n\nAlso, since \\( e = b - n \\geq 1 \\), \\( n \\leq b - 1 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( k + m + n \\leq (b - 1) + (b - 2) + (b - 3) = 3b - 6 \\), so \\( 5b - 124 \\leq 3b - 6 \\), which simplifies to \\( 2b \\leq 118 \\), so \\( b \\leq 59 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( b \\) can be from 26 to 59.\n\nBut earlier, when \\( b = 26 \\), one possible \\( e = 11 \\), and when \\( b = 22 \\), \\( e = 17 \\), but \\( b = 22 \\) is less than 26, which is the minimal value for \\( b \\). So, there might be inconsistency here.\n\nWait, earlier I thought \\( b \\geq 26 \\), but if \\( b = 22 \\), it seems to work, but according to the inequality, \\( b \\geq 26 \\).\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the earlier inequality.\n\nLet me re-examine:\n\nFrom \\( 5b - 124 = k + m + n \\), and \\( k + m + n \\geq 6 \\), so \\( 5b - 124 \\geq 6 \\), hence \\( 5b \\geq 130 \\), so \\( b \\geq 26 \\).\n\nBut when \\( b = 26 \\), \\( k + m + n = 5(26) - 124 = 130 - 124 = 6 \\), which matches the minimal sum.\n\nHowever, when \\( b = 22 \\), \\( 5(22) - 124 = 110 - 124 = -14 \\), which is less than 6, so \\( b \\) cannot be 22.\n\nThis suggests that \\( b \\geq 26 \\), not 22.\n\nTherefore, earlier assumption that \\( b = 22 \\) is invalid, which means that the solution with \\( b = 22 \\), \\( e = 17 \\) is not valid, because it violates the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value for \\( b \\) is 26.\n\nNow, with \\( b = 26 \\), \\( a = 52 \\), and \\( c + d + e = 124 - 52 - 26 = 46 \\).\n\nPossible \\( c, d, e \\) such that \\( c < 26 \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), sum to 46.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), sum is 46.\n\n- \\( c = 18 \\), \\( d = 17 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), sum is 46.\n\n- \\( c = 25 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 6 \\), sum is 46.\n\nAll these satisfy the conditions, but \\( e \\) varies between 6 and 18.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique solution based on additional constraints I haven't considered yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have multiple solutions, and I need to find one possible value for \\( e \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find the minimal possible value for \\( e \\), which would occur when \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are as large as possible.\n\nIf \\( c \\) is as large as possible, \\( c = b - 1 = 25 \\), \\( d = c - 1 = 24 \\), \\( e = 46 - 25 - 24 = 46 - 49 = -3 \\), which is invalid.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, to minimize \\( e \\), maximize \\( c \\) and \\( d \\).\n\nGiven \\( c < b = 26 \\), so \\( c \\leq 25 \\), \\( d < c \\), so \\( d \\leq 24 \\), then \\( e = 46 - 25 - 24 = -3 \\), which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, cannot have \\( c = 25 \\) and \\( d = 24 \\), as it leads to negative \\( e \\).\n\nTherefore, need to reduce \\( c \\) or \\( d \\).\n\nFor example, \\( c = 25 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 6 \\), which is valid.\n\nAlternatively, \\( c = 20 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 11 \\), which is also valid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible \\( e \\) is 6, and the maximal possible \\( e \\) is 11 in this case.\n\nWait, but in the first combination, \\( e = 6 \\), and in the second, \\( e = 11 \\).\n\nSo, depending on the choices of \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), \\( e \\) can vary.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the least popular barber can have different numbers of customers, depending on the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the minimal possible value for \\( e \\), which would be 6 in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique solution that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have multiple solutions, and I need to find one possible value for \\( e \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the barbers' customer numbers are consecutive integers, but that seems unlikely given the earlier contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the differences between the barbers' customer numbers are equal, but again, that led to negative values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the sum of the three least popular barbers is minimized, but that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the least popular barber has the minimal possible number of customers, given the constraints.\n\nGiven that, with \\( b = 26 \\), the minimal \\( e \\) is 6, as in the combination \\( c = 25 \\), \\( d = 15 \\), \\( e = 6 \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a better way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up equations and solve for integer solutions more systematically.\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( a = 2b \\), and \\( a + b + c + d + e = 124 \\), so \\( 3b + c + d + e = 124 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( c < b \\), \\( d < c \\), \\( e < d \\), all positive integers.\n\nLet\u2019s express \\( c = b -
