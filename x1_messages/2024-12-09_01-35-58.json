        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and they play different sports: soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Specifically, 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 22 play volleyball. Additionally, we know that 8 students play all three sports. We need to find out how many students play exactly two sports.\n\nFirst, I think it would be helpful to use a Venn diagram to visualize this situation. A Venn diagram with three circles can represent the three sports: one circle for soccer, one for basketball, and one for volleyball. The overlapping areas will represent students who play more than one sport.\n\nGiven that 8 students play all three sports, that would be the center area where all three circles overlap.\n\nNow, let's denote:\n\n- S as the set of students who play soccer.\n\n- B as the set of students who play basketball.\n\n- V as the set of students who play volleyball.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |S| = 18\n\n- |B| = 20\n\n- |V| = 22\n\n- |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = 8\n\nWe need to find the number of students who play exactly two sports. That means we need to find the number of students who play soccer and basketball but not volleyball, plus those who play soccer and volleyball but not basketball, plus those who play basketball and volleyball but not soccer.\n\nIn set notation, that would be:\n\n|S \u2229 B - V| + |S \u2229 V - B| + |B \u2229 V - S|\n\nAlternatively, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of students who play at least one sport and then manipulate that to find the number who play exactly two sports.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nWe know |S \u222a B \u222a V| is the number of students who play at least one sport. But we also know that there are 30 students in total. So, if everyone plays at least one sport, then |S \u222a B \u222a V| = 30. But let's verify that.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the known values:\n\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + 8\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n18 + 20 + 22 = 60\n\n60 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|) + 8 = 30\n\nSo,\n\n68 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|) = 30\n\nTherefore,\n\n|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = 68 - 30 = 38\n\nNow, we need to find the number of students who play exactly two sports. Let's denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s say x = |S \u2229 B - V| (soccer and basketball but not volleyball)\n\n- y = |S \u2229 V - B| (soccer and volleyball but not basketball)\n\n- z = |B \u2229 V - S| (basketball and volleyball but not soccer)\n\nWe need to find x + y + z.\n\nAdditionally, we know that:\n\n|S \u2229 B| = x + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\n|S \u2229 V| = y + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\n|B \u2229 V| = z + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nGiven that |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = 8, we can write:\n\n|S \u2229 B| = x + 8\n\n|S \u2229 V| = y + 8\n\n|B \u2229 V| = z + 8\n\nNow, earlier we found that |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = 38\n\nSubstituting the above expressions:\n\n(x + 8) + (y + 8) + (z + 8) = 38\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx + y + z + 24 = 38\n\nTherefore:\n\nx + y + z = 38 - 24 = 14\n\nSo, the number of students who play exactly two sports is 14.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the inclusion-exclusion principle directly to find the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nThe formula for the number of students playing exactly two sports is:\n\n|S \u2229 B - V| + |S \u2229 V - B| + |B \u2229 V - S| = (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|) - 3|S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nWait, no. Actually, the formula for exactly two sports is:\n\n|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| - 3|S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nBut hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let's think again.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|S \u2229 B| includes those who play soccer and basketball, including those who play all three.\n\nSimilarly for |S \u2229 V| and |B \u2229 V|.\n\nSo, to find those who play exactly two sports, we need to subtract those who play all three from each of these pairwise intersections.\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumber of students playing exactly two sports = (|S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|) + (|S \u2229 V| - |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|) + (|B \u2229 V| - |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|) - 3|S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nFrom earlier, we have |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = 38, and |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = 8.\n\nSo, number of students playing exactly two sports = 38 - 3*8 = 38 - 24 = 14\n\nThat matches our earlier result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's also check if the total number of students adds up correctly.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Only soccer: |S| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\n- Only basketball: |B| - |S \u2229 B| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\n- Only volleyball: |V| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\n- Exactly two sports: as calculated, 14\n\n- All three sports: 8\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the inclusion-exclusion formula for the total number of students playing at least one sport:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nWe already used this and found that |S \u222a B \u222a V| = 30, which matches the total number of students. So, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play exactly two sports is indeed 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
