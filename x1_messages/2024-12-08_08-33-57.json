        "content": "So, the factory makes 400 toys each day, and they operate 6 days a week. I need to find out how many toys they make in a year, which has 52 weeks.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many toys are made in one week. Since they work 6 days a week and make 400 toys each day, I can multiply 400 by 6 to get the weekly production.\n\nSo, 400 toys/day * 6 days/week = 2400 toys/week.\n\nNow, to find out the annual production, I need to multiply the weekly production by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:\n\n2400 toys/week * 52 weeks/year = 124,800 toys/year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total number of days the factory operates in a year and then multiply that by the daily production.\n\nFirst, find the total number of operating days in a year. Since they operate 6 days a week and there are 52 weeks in a year:\n\n6 days/week * 52 weeks/year = 312 days/year.\n\nNow, multiply the number of operating days by the daily production:\n\n312 days/year * 400 toys/day = 124,800 toys/year.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, 124,800 toys per year.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any leap years or extra days. A standard year has 52 weeks and 1 extra day. Since the factory operates 6 days a week, if the extra day falls on an operating day, they might produce more toys.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"52 weeks,\" so perhaps it's assuming a standard 52-week year without considering leap years. In that case, 124,800 toys/year is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to consider a standard calendar year, which has 365 days, and the factory operates 6 days a week, we might need to account for the extra day.\n\nLet me calculate the total operating days in a 365-day year.\n\nFirst, find out how many weeks are in 365 days: 365 \u00f7 7 \u2248 52.1429 weeks.\n\nSince they operate 6 days a week, the total operating days would be:\n\n52 weeks * 6 days/week = 312 days.\n\nPlus, there's 0.1429 of a week, which is about 1 day (since 0.1429 * 7 \u2248 1 day).\n\nSo, if the factory operates on that extra day, total operating days would be 312 + 1 = 313 days.\n\nTherefore, total annual production would be:\n\n313 days * 400 toys/day = 125,200 toys.\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier calculation of 124,800 toys.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the extra day might not be an operating day. If the factory operates 6 days a week, it might have a fixed day off, say Sunday. In that case, depending on how the year starts, the extra day might be a non-operating day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem simplifies things by assuming exactly 52 weeks in a year, with no extra days.\n\nGiven that, I think the safe answer is 124,800 toys per year.\n\nBut to cover all bases, perhaps I should calculate both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: exactly 52 weeks in a year, 6 days a week operation.\n\nTotal operating days: 52 weeks * 6 days/week = 312 days.\n\nTotal production: 312 days * 400 toys/day = 124,800 toys.\n\nSecond scenario: a standard 365-day year with 6 days a week operation.\n\nTotal operating days: 52 weeks * 6 days/week + 1 extra day = 313 days.\n\nTotal production: 313 days * 400 toys/day = 125,200 toys.\n\nHowever, if it's a leap year with 366 days, and assuming the extra day is an operating day, total operating days would be 313 days.\n\nBut since the problem specifies \"52 weeks,\" I think the first scenario is more appropriate, leading to 124,800 toys per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory operates 312 days a year, but there might be holidays or other non-operating days that are already factored into the 6 days a week operation.\n\nGiven that, I think sticking with the initial calculation is fine.\n\nTherefore, the factory makes 124,800 toys in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{124800} \\]"
