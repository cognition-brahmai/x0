        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges a flat fee of $25 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. The customer rents the car for 3 days and drives 150 miles. I need to calculate the total charge.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the days rented. Since it's $25 per day and the customer rents the car for 3 days, I'll multiply 25 by 3.\n\n25 * 3 = 75\n\nSo, the cost for the days rented is $75.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost for the miles driven. It's 15 cents per mile, and the customer drove 150 miles. I need to multiply 0.15 by 150.\n\n0.15 * 150 = 22.5\n\nSo, the cost for the miles driven is $22.50.\n\nNow, I'll add both amounts to get the total charge.\n\n75 + 22.5 = 97.5\n\nTherefore, the total charge will be $97.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{97.50} \\]"
