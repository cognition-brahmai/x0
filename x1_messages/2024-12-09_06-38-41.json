        "content": "To create a Python script that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of a specified search string, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Accept Command Line Arguments**: Use the `sys` module to handle command line arguments.\n2. **Read the File**: Open and read the contents of the specified text file.\n3. **Count Occurrences**: Count how many times the search string appears in the file content.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the count to the console.\n\nHere's a sample script that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Check if the correct number of arguments are provided\n    if len(sys.argv) != 3:\n        print(\"Usage: python script.py <file_path> <search_string>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    file_path = sys.argv[1]\n    search_string = sys.argv[2]\n    \n    try:\n        # Open the file and read its contents\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n        \n        # Count the occurrences of the search string\n        count = content.count(search_string)\n        \n        # Output the result\n        print(f\"The string '{search_string}' appears {count} times in the file.\")\n    \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: The file {file_path} was not found.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Command Line Arguments**:\n   - `sys.argv` is used to access command line arguments.\n   - The script expects two arguments: the file path and the search string.\n\n2. **File Handling**:\n   - `open(file_path, 'r')` opens the file in read mode.\n   - `file.read()` reads the entire content of the file into a string.\n\n3. **Counting Occurrences**:\n   - `content.count(search_string)` returns the number of times the search string appears in the file content.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Checks if the correct number of arguments are provided.\n   - Handles the case where the file is not found using a `FileNotFoundError`.\n   - Catches other exceptions and prints an error message.\n\nTo run this script, save it to a file (e.g., `count_string.py`) and execute it from the command line like this:\n\n```sh\npython count_string.py path/to/your/file.txt \"search string\"\n```\n\nReplace `path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to your text file and `\"search string\"` with the string you want to count."
