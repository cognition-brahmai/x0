        "content": "So the hospital is looking to upgrade its emergency department by adding more beds and staff. They currently have 100 beds and want to increase that by 50%. That means they want to add 50% of 100 beds, which is 50 beds. So, they'll have a total of 150 beds after the expansion.\n\nThey have a budget of $15 million for this expansion, and the cost breakdown is:\n\n- 60% for construction and equipment\n\n- 30% for hiring additional staff\n\n- 10% for training and other expenses\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the budget allocation for each category.\n\nStarting with construction and equipment:\n\n60% of $15 million is calculated as:\n\n0.60 * 15,000,000 = 9,000,000\n\nSo, $9 million is allocated for construction and equipment.\n\nNext, for hiring additional staff:\n\n30% of $15 million is:\n\n0.30 * 15,000,000 = 4,500,000\n\nSo, $4.5 million is allocated for hiring additional staff.\n\nLastly, for training and other expenses:\n\n10% of $15 million is:\n\n0.10 * 15,000,000 = 1,500,000\n\nSo, $1.5 million is allocated for training and other expenses.\n\nNow, the question is to determine how many new staff members can be hired, considering an average annual salary of $70,000 per employee.\n\nThe budget allocated for hiring additional staff is $4.5 million.\n\nTo find out how many staff members can be hired, we divide the allocated budget by the average annual salary:\n\n4,500,000 / 70,000 = 64.2857...\n\nSince you can't hire a fraction of a staff member, they can hire 64 new staff members with the $4.5 million budget.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that this calculation assumes that the entire 30% budget is used solely for salaries, without accounting for benefits, bonuses, or other costs associated with employing new staff. In reality, the total cost per employee might be higher than just the salary.\n\nBut based on the information provided, the hospital can hire 64 new staff members with the allocated budget for hiring.\n\n**Summary of budget allocation:**\n\n- Construction and equipment: $9,000,000\n\n- Hiring additional staff: $4,500,000\n\n- Training and other expenses: $1,500,000\n\n**Number of new staff members that can be hired:** 64"
