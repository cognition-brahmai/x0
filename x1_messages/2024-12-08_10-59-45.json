        "content": "So there are 600 students in the school. Out of these, 45% play sports. To find out how many students play sports, I need to calculate 45% of 600.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate 45% of 600:\n\n45% of 600 = (45/100) * 600\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n45 divided by 100 is 0.45.\n\n0.45 multiplied by 600 is 270.\n\nSo, 270 students play sports.\n\nNow, out of these 270 students who play sports, 30% also participate in music programs. I need to find out how many that is.\n\nSo, 30% of 270:\n\n30% of 270 = (30/100) * 270\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n30 divided by 100 is 0.30.\n\n0.30 multiplied by 270 is 81.\n\nTherefore, 81 students participate in both sports and music.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as overall, what percentage of students participate in both.\n\nFirst, 45% play sports, and of those, 30% also do music.\n\nSo, the percentage of students who do both is 45% * 30% = 13.5%.\n\nThen, 13.5% of 600 students would be:\n\n13.5% of 600 = (13.5/100) * 600\n\nThat's 0.135 * 600 = 81.\n\nSame answer, 81 students.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use fractions for a more precise calculation.\n\n45% is 9/20, and 30% is 3/10.\n\nSo, first, 9/20 of 600 is:\n\n(9/20) * 600 = (9 * 600) / 20 = 5400 / 20 = 270.\n\nThen, 3/10 of 270 is:\n\n(3/10) * 270 = (3 * 270) / 10 = 810 / 10 = 81.\n\nAgain, 81 students.\n\nAlternatively, calculating 13.5% directly:\n\n13.5% of 600 is:\n\n(13.5/100) * 600 = 0.135 * 600 = 81.\n\nConsistently getting 81 students.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem to ensure accuracy?\n\nPerhaps using proportions.\n\nIf 100 students play sports, then 30% also do music, which is 30 students.\n\nBut here, 45% of 600 play sports, which is 270 students.\n\nSo, setting up a proportion:\n\nIf 100 sports students have 30 music students,\n\nThen 270 sports students have x music students.\n\nSo, x = (30 / 100) * 270 = 81.\n\nAgain, 81 students.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of Venn diagrams.\n\nThere are students who play sports and students who participate in music.\n\nBut the question specifies that 30% of those who play sports also participate in music.\n\nSo, it's a subset of the sports players who are also in music.\n\nHence, 30% of 270 is 81.\n\nNo overlapping considerations needed beyond that.\n\nI think 81 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{81} \\]"
