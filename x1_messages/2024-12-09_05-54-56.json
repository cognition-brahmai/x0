        "content": "So, let's see. We have a company with 8 employees, each working 40 hours per week, and they're paid $20 per hour. We need to find out the company's monthly payroll expense.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate how much one employee earns in a week. Since they work 40 hours per week and are paid $20 per hour, their weekly earnings would be 40 hours * $20/hour = $800 per week.\n\nNow, there are 8 employees, so the total weekly payroll would be 8 employees * $800/employee = $6,400 per week.\n\nBut we need the monthly expense, not the weekly one. Typically, there are about 4 weeks in a month, so multiplying the weekly payroll by 4 would give us the monthly expense. So, $6,400/week * 4 weeks/month = $25,600 per month.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard that some calculations use a different number of weeks in a month because not all months have exactly 4 weeks. Some months have a little more, some have a little less. Maybe I should use a more accurate figure for the number of weeks in a month.\n\nI know that a year has 52 weeks, and there are 12 months in a year, so dividing 52 by 12 gives approximately 4.333 weeks per month. If I use that, then the monthly payroll would be $6,400/week * 4.333 weeks/month = about $27,731 per month.\n\nBut that seems higher than the initial calculation. Maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the annual payroll and then divide by 12 to get the monthly expense.\n\nFirst, find the annual earnings for one employee. They work 40 hours per week at $20 per hour, so $800 per week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so one employee earns $800/week * 52 weeks/year = $41,600 per year.\n\nWith 8 employees, the total annual payroll is 8 * $41,600 = $332,800 per year.\n\nNow, to find the monthly expense, divide the annual payroll by 12 months: $332,800 / 12 = approximately $27,733.33 per month.\n\nHmm, this matches the previous calculation using 4.333 weeks per month.\n\nSo, between the two methods, the more accurate monthly payroll expense is about $27,733.33 per month.\n\nBut the first method using 4 weeks per month gave $25,600, which is lower. I think using 4.333 weeks is better because it accounts for the varying number of weeks in each month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the exact number of days in the month and calculate based on that.\n\nLet's see, if a month has 30 days, and employees work 40 hours per week, which is 8 hours per day, then 30 days * 8 hours/day = 240 hours per month per employee.\n\nAt $20 per hour, that would be 240 hours * $20/hour = $4,800 per month per employee.\n\nWith 8 employees, the total monthly payroll would be 8 * $4,800 = $38,400 per month.\n\nWait, that's even higher than before. But this seems inconsistent with the previous calculations.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake here. If employees work 40 hours per week, and there are approximately 4.333 weeks in a month, then the monthly hours would be 40 hours/week * 4.333 weeks/month = 173.32 hours per month per employee.\n\nAt $20 per hour, that's 173.32 hours * $20/hour = $3,466.40 per month per employee.\n\nFor 8 employees, that's 8 * $3,466.40 = $27,731.20 per month.\n\nThis is consistent with the earlier calculation using the weekly method.\n\nSo, the calculation using 30 days in a month seems off. Maybe because assuming 30 days in a month isn't accurate, as not all months have 30 days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact number of days in the specific month, but that would vary, making it complicated.\n\nI think the better approach is to use the number of weeks in a month, which is approximately 4.333, as done earlier.\n\nTherefore, the company's monthly payroll expense is approximately $27,733.33.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps I should consider the exact number of weeks in the specific month, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard industry practice for calculating monthly payroll.\n\nI recall that some companies use a 4-week month for payroll purposes, which would make calculations simpler, but might not reflect the exact monthly expense.\n\nIn that case, using 4 weeks per month, the monthly payroll would be $6,400/week * 4 weeks/month = $25,600 per month.\n\nHowever, as we saw, this is lower than the annualization method, which gives approximately $27,733 per month.\n\nI think the annualization method is more accurate because it takes into account the actual number of weeks in a year and months.\n\nTherefore, the company's monthly payroll expense is approximately $27,733.33.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider another approach.\n\nIf there are 8 employees earning $20 per hour, working 40 hours per week, and 52 weeks in a year, the total annual payroll is 8 * $20/hour * 40 hours/week * 52 weeks/year = $332,800 per year.\n\nDividing that by 12 months, we get $332,800 / 12 = $27,733.33 per month.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the company's monthly payroll expense is approximately $27,733.33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27733.33} \\]"
