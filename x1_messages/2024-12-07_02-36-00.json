        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a city with 2,000 households. Out of these:\n\n- 60% have at least one dog.\n\n- 30% have at least one cat.\n\n- 20% have both a dog and a cat.\n\nAnd we need to find out how many households have neither a dog nor a cat.\n\nFirst, I think it would help to visualize this with a Venn diagram. We have two circles overlapping: one for dog owners and one for cat owners.\n\n- The portion that has only dogs would be 60% minus the 20% that have both.\n\n- The portion that has only cats would be 30% minus the 20% that have both.\n\n- The overlapping area is 20%, which are households that have both a dog and a cat.\n\nSo, calculating the percentages:\n\nOnly dogs: 60% - 20% = 40%\n\nOnly cats: 30% - 20% = 10%\n\nBoth dogs and cats: 20%\n\nNow, if we add these up: 40% + 10% + 20% = 70%\n\nThat means 70% of households have at least one pet, either a dog, a cat, or both.\n\nTherefore, the remaining percentage that has neither a dog nor a cat would be 100% - 70% = 30%.\n\nNow, to find out how many households that corresponds to, we take 30% of 2,000 households.\n\n30% of 2,000 is calculated as:\n\n(30/100) * 2,000 = 0.3 * 2,000 = 600 households.\n\nSo, 600 households have neither a dog nor a cat.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the number of households that have at least one pet.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nNumber of households with at least one pet = (households with dogs) + (households with cats) - (households with both).\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Households with dogs = 60% of 2,000 = 0.6 * 2,000 = 1,200\n\n- Households with cats = 30% of 2,000 = 0.3 * 2,000 = 600\n\n- Households with both = 20% of 2,000 = 0.2 * 2,000 = 400\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n1,200 + 600 - 400 = 1,400 households have at least one pet.\n\nTherefore, the number of households with neither a dog nor a cat is the total households minus those with at least one pet:\n\n2,000 - 1,400 = 600 households.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 600 households.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's verify the percentages again.\n\nTotal percentage with at least one pet:\n\nOnly dogs: 40%\n\nOnly cats: 10%\n\nBoth: 20%\n\nSum: 70%, as before.\n\nNeither: 30%\n\n30% of 2,000 is indeed 600.\n\nAlternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion principle directly on percentages:\n\nPercentage with at least one pet = 60% + 30% - 20% = 70%\n\nNeither = 30%, which is 600 households.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the final answer is 600 households.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
