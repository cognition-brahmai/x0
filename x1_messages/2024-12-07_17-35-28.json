        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a store sells 4 types of cookies\u2014chocolate chip, oatmeal, sugar, and peanut butter. I want to buy exactly 12 cookies, and I have to have at least one of each type. I need to figure out how many different combinations of these cookies I can choose.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It's a problem about combinations, specifically combinations with restrictions. I need to select 12 cookies in total, making sure that I have at least one of each type. There are four types of cookies, and I can choose any number of each type as long as I don't have zero of any type.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using the \"stars and bars\" theorem, which is a common method in combinatorics for solving problems of distributing indistinguishable objects into distinct bins, with some constraints.\n\nIn the standard stars and bars problem, if I want to find the number of ways to distribute \\( n \\) indistinguishable objects into \\( k \\) distinct bins, with no restrictions, the formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\n\nHowever, in this problem, there's a restriction that each bin (each type of cookie) must have at least one object (at least one cookie). So, I need to adjust the formula to account for this condition.\n\nTo handle the \"at least one of each\" condition, I can first allocate one cookie to each type. Since there are four types, I'm allocating four cookies right away (one to each type). This ensures that I have at least one of each type.\n\nNow, after allocating one cookie to each type, I have \\( 12 - 4 = 8 \\) cookies left to distribute without any restrictions.\n\nSo, the problem now reduces to finding the number of ways to distribute these remaining 8 cookies among the 4 types, with the possibility of some types getting zero additional cookies.\n\nThis is now a standard stars and bars problem where I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 8\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( x_i \\) represents the number of additional cookies of type \\( i \\).\n\nUsing the stars and bars formula mentioned earlier, with \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\), the number of solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{11}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( \\binom{11}{3} \\).\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11!}{3!(11 - 3)!} = \\frac{11!}{3! \\cdot 8!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 8! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{3! \\times 8!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 10 = 110 \\\\\n110 \\times 9 = 990\n\\]\n\nAnd the denominator is 6, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{990}{6} = 165\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 165 different combinations of cookies I can choose.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my reasoning to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nFirst, I confirmed that this is a combinations problem with restrictions, specifically that I need at least one of each type of cookie.\n\nI then applied the stars and bars method, which seems appropriate for distributing indistinguishable objects (cookies) into distinct bins (types of cookies).\n\nBy allocating one cookie to each type upfront, I ensured that the \"at least one\" condition is met, and then I distributed the remaining cookies without restrictions.\n\nThe formula I used, \\( \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\), is correct for this scenario.\n\nMy calculation of \\( \\binom{11}{3} = 165 \\) also seems accurate.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?\n\nAlternatively, I could think about generating functions. In combinatorics, generating functions can also be used to solve distribution problems.\n\nFor each type of cookie, since I need at least one, the generating function for each type is:\n\n\\[\nx + x^2 + x^3 + \\dots = \\frac{x}{1 - x}\n\\]\n\nSince there are four types, the generating function for the entire selection is:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x}{1 - x} \\right)^4 = \\frac{x^4}{(1 - x)^4}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need the coefficient of \\( x^{12} \\) in this generating function, which represents the number of ways to choose 12 cookies with at least one of each type.\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\( x^{12} \\) in \\( \\frac{x^4}{(1 - x)^4} \\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\( x^{8} \\) in \\( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^4} \\), since \\( x^4 \\times x^8 = x^{12} \\).\n\nI know that the coefficient of \\( x^{n} \\) in \\( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^{k}} \\) is \\( \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\( x^{8} \\) in \\( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^4} \\) is \\( \\binom{8 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{11}{3} = 165 \\), which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using two different methods\u2014stars and bars and generating functions\u2014I've arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence that 165 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that I need to distribute 12 cookies into 4 types, with each type getting at least one. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integer solutions to the equation:\n\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 12 \\quad \\text{with} \\quad y_i \\geq 1 \\quad \\text{for all} \\quad i\n\\]\n\nBy making the substitution \\( x_i = y_i - 1 \\), where \\( x_i \\geq 0 \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x_1 + 1) + (x_2 + 1) + (x_3 + 1) + (x_4 + 1) = 12 \\\\\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 8\n\\]\n\nAgain, this is the same as the earlier stars and bars problem, confirming the approach.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning, and the answer seems consistent across different methods. Therefore, I'm confident that the number of different combinations is 165.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]"
