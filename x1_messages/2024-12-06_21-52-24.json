It's interesting to note that \"Go Set a Watchman\" was actually written before \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" but it was originally intended as a first draft. However, Lee's editor suggested that she expand the flashback sequences in the story, which led to the creation of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" The original manuscript of \"Go Set a Watchman\" was later rediscovered and published after Lee's death."
