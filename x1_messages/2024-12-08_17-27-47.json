        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 10 red balls, 20 blue balls, and 30 green balls in a box. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacing the first one, both of them will be green. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. That should be 10 red plus 20 blue plus 30 green, which totals up to 60 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of picking two green balls without replacement. Without replacement means that once I pick the first ball, it stays out, and the total number of balls decreases by one for the second pick.\n\nSo, the probability of the first ball being green is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls. That's 30 green out of 60 total, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nNext, given that the first ball was green, there are now 29 green balls left and a total of 59 balls remaining in the box. So, the probability that the second ball is also green is 29/59.\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen\u2014both balls being green\u2014I need to multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event given that the first one occurred. That is, (30/60) * (29/59).\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 30 divided by 60 is 0.5. Then, 29 divided by 59 is approximately 0.4915. Multiplying those together: 0.5 * 0.4915 is about 0.24575.\n\nBut maybe I should keep it as a fraction to be more precise. So, (30/60) * (29/59) simplifies to (1/2) * (29/59), which is 29/(2*59). Since 29 is a prime number and doesn't divide into 59, the fraction simplifies to 29/118.\n\nTo confirm, 29 divided by 118 is indeed approximately 0.24575, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls picked are green is 29/118 or approximately 0.24575, which is about 24.575%.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can simplify 29/118 further. Let's see, 29 is a prime number, and 118 divided by 29 is 4. So, 29/118 simplifies to 1/4. Wait, that can't be right because 29*4 is 116, not 118. So, 29 doesn't divide evenly into 118.\n\nActually, let's check: 29 times 4 is 116, and 118 minus 116 is 2, so no, it doesn't simplify further. So, 29/118 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the combination formula to calculate the probability. The number of ways to choose 2 green balls out of 30 is C(30,2), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls out of 60 is C(60,2). So, the probability is C(30,2)/C(60,2).\n\nLet's calculate that to verify. C(30,2) is (30*29)/2 = 435. C(60,2) is (60*59)/2 = 1770. So, the probability is 435/1770.\n\nSimplifying 435/1770, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 15. 435 divided by 15 is 29, and 1770 divided by 15 is 118. So, it's again 29/118, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 29/118, or approximately 0.24575.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to think about the probabilities step by step. The probability that the first ball is green is 30/60 = 1/2. Given that the first ball is green, the probability that the second ball is also green is 29/59. Multiplying them gives (1/2)*(29/59) = 29/118, which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the order doesn't matter, I can think of selecting two balls at once, and the probability that both are green is the number of ways to choose two green balls divided by the total number of ways to choose any two balls, which again is C(30,2)/C(60,2) = 29/118.\n\nSo, all these methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the probability is 29/118.\n\nWait, but 29/118 can be simplified further. Wait, 29 is a prime number, and 118 is 2*59, so the greatest common divisor is 1, meaning it's already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, dividing numerator and denominator by 29 gives 1/4, but that's not accurate because 118 divided by 29 is not an integer. Wait, no, 118 divided by 29 is approximately 4.069, which is not an integer, so 29/118 is indeed in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, 29/118 can be left as is, or perhaps converted to a decimal or percentage for better understanding.\n\nAs a decimal, 29 divided by 118 is approximately 0.24576, which is about 24.576%.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 24.576%, or more precisely, 29/118.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{29}{118}} \\]"
