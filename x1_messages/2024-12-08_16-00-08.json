        "content": "So if I save $5 every week, and I want to know how much I'll have after one year, I need to figure out how many weeks there are in a year first. I know that there are 52 weeks in a year. So, if I save $5 each week, I can multiply 52 weeks by $5 per week to find the total savings for the year.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal savings = number of weeks in a year \u00d7 amount saved per week\n\nSo,\n\nTotal savings = 52 weeks \u00d7 $5/week\n\nNow, 52 multiplied by 5 is:\n\n52 \u00d7 5 = 260\n\nTherefore, I would have saved $260 after one year.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by calculating it based on months instead of weeks. There are 12 months in a year, and if I assume that each month has about 4 weeks, then each month would have approximately 4 weeks \u00d7 $5/week = $20 per month saved.\n\nThen, over 12 months, that would be 12 \u00d7 $20 = $240.\n\nHmm, that's different from the $260 I got earlier. Why is there a difference?\n\nOh, I see. The difference comes from the fact that there are actually 52 weeks in a year, which is a bit more than 12 months \u00d7 4 weeks per month. Because 12 \u00d7 4 equals 48 weeks, but there are 52 weeks in a year. So, the extra 4 weeks would account for the additional $20 ($5 \u00d7 4 weeks) that brings the total from $240 to $260.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the exact number of days in a year and see how many weeks that would be. A non-leap year has 365 days. Since one week has 7 days, 365 \u00f7 7 equals approximately 52.14 weeks. So, roughly 52 weeks.\n\nIn a leap year, with 366 days, it would be 366 \u00f7 7, which is about 52.29 weeks.\n\nSo, in either case, it's still approximately 52 weeks in a year.\n\nTherefore, saving $5 per week would lead to saving $260 in a year.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any interest earned on this saved money. If I'm keeping this money in a savings account that earns interest, then the total would be higher. However, if it's just kept in a piggy bank or a non-interest-bearing account, then the total would be exactly $260.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume it's a non-interest-bearing account.\n\nSo, the final answer is $260.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{260} \\]"
