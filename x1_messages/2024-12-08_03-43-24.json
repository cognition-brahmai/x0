        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have apples costing $2 per pound and oranges costing $3 per pound. The customer wants to spend exactly $20, and they want to buy twice as many pounds of apples as oranges. Okay, let's define some variables to make this clearer.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( o \\) represent the number of pounds of oranges.\n\n- Since the customer wants twice as many pounds of apples as oranges, the number of pounds of apples will be \\( 2o \\).\n\nNow, the cost for oranges would be \\( 3 \\) dollars per pound times the number of pounds, which is \\( 3o \\).\n\nSimilarly, the cost for apples would be \\( 2 \\) dollars per pound times the number of pounds, which is \\( 2 \\times 2o = 4o \\).\n\nThe total cost should be exactly \\( 20 \\) dollars, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 3o + 4o = 20 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\n\\[ 7o = 20 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( o \\):\n\n\\[ o = \\frac{20}{7} \\]\n\nThat's approximately \\( 2.857 \\) pounds of oranges.\n\nSince the apples are twice that amount:\n\n\\[ 2o = 2 \\times \\frac{20}{7} = \\frac{40}{7} \\]\n\nWhich is approximately \\( 5.714 \\) pounds of apples.\n\nBut let's check if this actually adds up to exactly \\( 20 \\) dollars.\n\nCost of oranges:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\frac{20}{7} = \\frac{60}{7} \\approx 8.571 \\] dollars.\n\nCost of apples:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times \\frac{40}{7} = \\frac{80}{7} \\approx 11.429 \\] dollars.\n\nAdding those together:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{7} + \\frac{80}{7} = \\frac{140}{7} = 20 \\] dollars.\n\nPerfect, it checks out. So, the customer should buy \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\) pounds of oranges and \\( \\frac{40}{7} \\) pounds of apples to spend exactly \\( 20 \\) dollars, with twice as many pounds of apples as oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe customer should buy \\(\\boxed{\\frac{20}{7}}\\) pounds of oranges and \\(\\boxed{\\frac{40}{7}}\\) pounds of apples."
