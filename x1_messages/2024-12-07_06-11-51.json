        "content": "Let's see. The baker uses 3 eggs for every 2 cakes. So, if she wants to bake 50 cakes, I need to figure out how many eggs that would require.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many sets of 2 cakes are there in 50 cakes. I can do that by dividing 50 by 2.\n\n50 \u00f7 2 = 25\n\nSo, there are 25 sets of 2 cakes in 50 cakes.\n\nNow, since each set of 2 cakes requires 3 eggs, I can find the total number of eggs by multiplying the number of sets by 3.\n\n25 \u00d7 3 = 75\n\nTherefore, the baker will need 75 eggs to bake 50 cakes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way is to find out how many eggs are needed per cake and then multiply by 50.\n\nIf 3 eggs are used for 2 cakes, then for 1 cake, it would be 3 \u00f7 2 = 1.5 eggs per cake.\n\nSo, for 50 cakes, it would be 1.5 \u00d7 50 = 75 eggs.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions. Set up a proportion where 3 eggs are to 2 cakes as x eggs are to 50 cakes.\n\nSo, 3/2 = x/50\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n3 \u00d7 50 = 2 \u00d7 x\n\n150 = 2x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 150 \u00f7 2 = 75\n\nAgain, the same answer, 75 eggs.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using ratios.\n\nThe ratio of eggs to cakes is 3:2. I need to find out how many eggs correspond to 50 cakes.\n\nSo, the ratio is 3 eggs for every 2 cakes. I can scale this up by multiplying both parts of the ratio by the same number until the cakes reach 50.\n\nStarting with 3 eggs for 2 cakes.\n\nMultiply both by 2: 6 eggs for 4 cakes.\n\nMultiply by 3: 9 eggs for 6 cakes.\n\nSee the pattern. Essentially, eggs = (3/2) \u00d7 cakes.\n\nSo, for 50 cakes: eggs = (3/2) \u00d7 50 = 75.\n\nAgain, the answer is 75 eggs.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that 75 eggs is the correct amount needed for 50 cakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
