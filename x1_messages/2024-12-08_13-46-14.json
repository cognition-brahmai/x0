        "content": "Kangaroos have pouches, also known as marsupiums, as part of their reproductive biology. They are marsupials, a group of mammals characterized by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young, which then continue to develop outside the womb, often within a pouch.\n\nIn kangaroos, the pouch serves as a safe and nurturing environment for the underdeveloped joey (baby kangaroo) immediately after birth. At birth, the joey is about the size of a jelly bean and is born in a fetal state. It uses its well-developed forelimbs to crawl from the birth canal into the mother's pouch, where it attaches to a nipple and continues to grow and develop.\n\nThe pouch provides protection, warmth, and a source of nourishment for the joey. The mother can also regulate the environment inside the pouch to suit the joey's needs as it grows. Once the joey is sufficiently developed, it will start to leave the pouch for short periods, returning for warmth and nourishment until it is fully independent.\n\nSo, the pouch is an evolutionary adaptation that allows marsupials like kangaroos to give birth to offspring that are less developed than those of placental mammals, yet still provide them with a safe and nurturing environment to continue their development outside the womb."
