        "content": "The author who created the character of Natty Bumppo, also known as Leatherstocking, is James Fenimore Cooper. He was an American writer who lived in the 19th century, specifically from 1789 to 1851. Cooper is often regarded as one of the first major novelists from the United States, and his Leatherstocking Tales are among his most famous works.\n\nNatty Bumppo is the protagonist in a series of five novels that depict life in the frontier regions of early America. These novels are:\n\n1. **\"The Deerslayer\"** (1841) - Set in the 1740s, it is the first in the series chronologically and introduces Natty Bumppo as a young man.\n\n2. **\"The Last of the Mohicans\"** (1826) - Probably the most famous of the series, set during the French and Indian War in the 1750s.\n\n3. **\"The Prairie\"** (1827) - Set in the 1790s on the western frontier, it features an older Natty Bumppo.\n\n4. **\"The Pathfinder\"** (1840) - Takes place during the French and Indian War, similar to \"The Last of the Mohicans.\"\n\n5. **\"The Pioneers\"** (1823) - The first published novel in the series, set in 1793, depicting life in upstate New York.\n\nThese novels not only showcase Natty Bumppo's adventures and moral struggles but also provide insights into the relationship between settlers and Native Americans, as well as the encroachment of civilization on the wilderness. Cooper's works were influential in shaping the image of the American frontier and have had a lasting impact on literature and popular culture.\n\n**Sources:**\n- Cooper, James Fenimore. \"The Deerslayer.\" 1841.\n- Cooper, James Fenimore. \"The Last of the Mohicans.\" 1826.\n- Cooper, James Fenimore. \"The Prairie.\" 1827.\n- Cooper, James Fenimore. \"The Pathfinder.\" 1840.\n- Cooper, James Fenimore. \"The Pioneers.\" 1823.\n- McQuade, Donald, et al., editors. \"The Norton Anthology of American Literature.\" W.W.
