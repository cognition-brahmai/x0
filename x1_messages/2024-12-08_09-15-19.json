        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car rental company with 100 cars in total. There are two types of cars: compact cars and luxury cars. The daily rate for a compact car is $25, and for a luxury car, it's $60. If all the cars are rented out in one day, the total revenue is $3,800. We need to find out how many compact cars and how many luxury cars the company has.\n\nFirst, I think we should define variables for the number of each type of car. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of compact cars.\n\n- Let \\( l \\) represent the number of luxury cars.\n\nWe know that the total number of cars is 100, so we can write the first equation as:\n\n\\[ c + l = 100 \\]\n\nNext, we know the revenue from renting each type of car. The revenue from compact cars would be \\( 25c \\) (since each compact car rents for $25 per day), and the revenue from luxury cars would be \\( 60l \\) (since each luxury car rents for $60 per day). The total revenue from renting all the cars is $3,800, so we can write the second equation as:\n\n\\[ 25c + 60l = 3800 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( c + l = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 25c + 60l = 3800 \\)\n\nTo solve this system, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I'll go with the substitution method here.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ c = 100 - l \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( c \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 25(100 - l) + 60l = 3800 \\]\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 2500 - 25l + 60l = 3800 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 2500 + 35l = 3800 \\]\n\nSubtract 2500 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 35l = 1300 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 35:\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{1300}{35} \\]\n\n\\[ l = 37.142857... \\]\n\nWait a minute, this gives us a decimal, but the number of cars should be a whole number. It seems like there's a mistake here because the number of luxury cars can't be a fraction. Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nStarting again from the substitution:\n\n\\[ c = 100 - l \\]\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 25(100 - l) + 60l = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ 2500 - 25l + 60l = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ 2500 + 35l = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ 35l = 1300 \\]\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{1300}{35} \\]\n\n\\[ l = 37.142857... \\]\n\nHmm, still getting a decimal. Maybe there's a mistake in setting up the equations. Let's reconsider the problem.\n\nWe have 100 cars in total, with some being compact and some being luxury. The total revenue from renting all cars is $3,800. Compact cars rent for $25 per day, and luxury cars rent for $60 per day.\n\nWait a second, maybe the total number of cars isn't necessarily 100, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"A car rental company has 100 cars available for rent. The daily rate for renting a compact car is $25, while the daily rate for renting a luxury car is $60. If all the cars were rented out in one day, the total revenue would be $3,800. How many compact cars and luxury cars does the company have?\"\n\nOkay, so it's clear: there are 100 cars in total, all of which are either compact or luxury. When all are rented, the total revenue is $3,800.\n\nOur equations seem correct:\n\n1. \\( c + l = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 25c + 60l = 3800 \\)\n\nBut solving them gives a non-integer value for \\( l \\), which doesn't make sense in this context. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself, or maybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nLet me try the elimination method instead of substitution to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( c + l = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 25c + 60l = 3800 \\)\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 25 to eliminate \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ 25c + 25l = 2500 \\]\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n\\[ (25c + 60l) - (25c + 25l) = 3800 - 2500 \\]\n\n\\[ 35l = 1300 \\]\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{1300}{35} \\]\n\n\\[ l = 37.142857... \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. This suggests that perhaps the problem has no solution with whole numbers, which is unusual for this type of problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the numbers provided. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nTotal cars: 100\n\nCompact car rate: $25 per day\n\nLuxury car rate: $60 per day\n\nTotal revenue: $3,800\n\nLet me see if there's a possible adjustment to these numbers that would make the solution have integer values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of cars isn't exactly 100, or the total revenue isn't exactly $3,800. But based on the problem statement, that's what's given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are different types of cars, but the problem says only compact and luxury cars.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way to have non-integer numbers of cars, but that doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rates are per hour, but the problem specifies \"daily rate,\" so that's probably correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the total revenue is meant to be something else. Let me see if there's a plausible total revenue that would result in integer values for \\( c \\) and \\( l \\).\n\nLet me assume that \\( l \\) is an integer, say 37, and see what \\( c \\) would be.\n\nIf \\( l = 37 \\), then \\( c = 100 - 37 = 63 \\)\n\nThen, the total revenue would be:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 63 + 60 \\times 37 = 1575 + 2220 = 3795 \\]\n\nWhich is $5 less than $3,800. Not quite matching.\n\nIf \\( l = 38 \\), then \\( c = 62 \\)\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 62 + 60 \\times 38 = 1550 + 2280 = 3830 \\]\n\nWhich is $30 more than $3,800.\n\nSo, it seems like there's no integer solution that exactly matches $3,800.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the company has 100 cars, but not all are rented out, but the problem says \"all the cars were rented out.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rates are different, but again, the problem specifies $25 for compact and $60 for luxury.\n\nGiven that, and the total revenue being $3,800, it seems there's an inconsistency because the solution doesn't yield integer values for the number of cars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company has more than 100 cars, but the problem says \"100 cars available for rent.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rates include tax, but the problem doesn't specify any tax.\n\nGiven all that, I think the most plausible conclusion is that there is no solution with integer numbers of cars that satisfies both equations exactly.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem expects us to round the number of cars to the nearest whole number. But that doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company has 100 cars, but some are not rented out, which would change the equations.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"if all the cars were rented out.\"\n\nGiven that, and the equations leading to a non-integer solution, I'm inclined to say that there is no solution with whole numbers of cars that fits the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem itself, and the total revenue should be different.\n\nFor example, if the total revenue were $3,850, then:\n\n\\[ 25c + 60l = 3850 \\]\n\nUsing \\( c = 100 - l \\):\n\n\\[ 25(100 - l) + 60l = 3850 \\]\n\n\\[ 2500 - 25l + 60l = 3850 \\]\n\n\\[ 2500 + 35l = 3850 \\]\n\n\\[ 35l = 1350 \\]\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{1350}{35} \\]\n\n\\[ l = 38.5714... \\]\n\nStill not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, if the total revenue were $3,750:\n\n\\[ 25c + 60l = 3750 \\]\n\n\\[ 25(100 - l) + 60l = 3750 \\]\n\n\\[ 2500 - 25l + 60l = 3750 \\]\n\n\\[ 2500 + 35l = 3750 \\]\n\n\\[ 35l = 1250 \\]\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{1250}{35} \\]\n\n\\[ l = 35.7142... \\]\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis is puzzling. Maybe the problem is designed to have no solution, to teach students to recognize when a problem has no feasible solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solving this problem.\n\nLet me try expressing one variable in terms of the other and see if that helps.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[ c = 100 - l \\]\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 25(100 - l) + 60l = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ 2500 - 25l + 60l = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ 2500 + 35l = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ 35l = 1300 \\]\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{1300}{35} \\]\n\n\\[ l = 37.\\overline{142857} \\]\n\nThis is approximately 37.1429, which is not an integer.\n\nSimilarly, solving for \\( c \\):\n\nFrom \\( c + l = 100 \\), \\( l = 100 - c \\)\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 25c + 60(100 - c) = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ 25c + 6000 - 60c = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ -35c + 6000 = 3800 \\]\n\n\\[ -35c = -2200 \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{2200}{35} \\]\n\n\\[ c = 62.8571... \\]\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that there is no solution with whole numbers of cars that satisfies both the total number of cars and the total revenue.\n\nPerhaps the problem is misstated, or perhaps it's designed to illustrate that not all problems have integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company has other types of cars, but the problem specifies only compact and luxury cars.\n\nGiven all that, I think the most appropriate answer is that there is no solution with integer numbers of cars that fits the given conditions.\n\nHowever, if the problem expects us to round the numbers, then we could say approximately 63 compact cars and 37 luxury cars, but that's not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the daily rates are different, but according to the problem, they are $25 and $60.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, there is no solution with whole numbers of cars that satisfies both the total number of cars and the total revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No solution with integer values for the number of cars.}} \\]"
