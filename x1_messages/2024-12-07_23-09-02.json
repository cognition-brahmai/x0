The initial investment includes purchasing 1,000 bicycles at a cost of $300 each, installing 100 docking stations at a cost of $10,000 per station, and setting up a mobile app for users to rent bikes. Calculate the total upfront cost of launching the bike-sharing program. Also, estimate the annual maintenance costs, assuming each bicycle requires an average of $50 in repairs per year, and the docking stations need $5,000 in upkeep annually."

        "content": "So the city is thinking about starting a bike-sharing program to help with traffic and encourage healthier ways to get around. They need to figure out how much it's going to cost to get everything set up and also what it will cost to keep it running each year.\n\nFirst, there's the initial investment. They need to buy 1,000 bicycles, and each one costs $300. So, to find out the total cost for the bikes, I'll multiply the number of bikes by the cost per bike:\n\n1,000 bikes * $300/bike = $300,000\n\nNext, they need to install 100 docking stations, and each station costs $10,000. So, for the docking stations:\n\n100 stations * $10,000/station = $1,000,000\n\nThen, there's the mobile app for users to rent bikes. The problem doesn't specify the cost of developing the app, so I'll assume that's included in the other costs or is a one-time fee that's already accounted for elsewhere. If not, we might need to estimate that, but for now, I'll proceed without it.\n\nSo, the total upfront cost would be the cost of the bikes plus the cost of the docking stations:\n\n$300,000 (bikes) + $1,000,000 (docking stations) = $1,300,000\n\nNow, for the annual maintenance costs. Each bicycle requires $50 in repairs per year, and there are 1,000 bikes:\n\n1,000 bikes * $50/bike/year = $50,000/year\n\nAdditionally, each docking station needs $5,000 in upkeep annually, and there are 100 stations:\n\n100 stations * $5,000/station/year = $500,000/year\n\nSo, the total annual maintenance cost would be:\n\n$50,000 (bikes) + $500,000 (docking stations) = $550,000/year\n\nIn summary, the total upfront cost to launch the bike-sharing program is $1,300,000, and the estimated annual maintenance cost is $550,000.\n\n**Total Upfront Cost:** $1,300,000\n\n**Annual Maintenance Cost:** $550,000"
