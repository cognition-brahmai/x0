        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to create a simple text-based Blackjack game in C++. I'm not an expert in C++, but I've done some programming before, so here's my attempt.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic rules of Blackjack:\n\n- The goal is to have cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without going over.\n\n- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.\n\n- Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is better for the hand.\n\n- The dealer and the player both get two cards initially, with one of the dealer's cards face down.\n\n- The player can choose to \"hit\" (take another card) or \"stand\" (keep current cards).\n\n- After the player finishes, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits until their total is 17 or higher.\n\n- There are outcomes like blackjack (21 with two cards), busting (going over 21), etc.\n\nFor this simple version, I'll ignore splitting, doubling down, and other advanced options.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the program:\n\n1. **Deck of Cards:**\n\n- Need to represent a deck of 52 cards.\n\n- Each card has a suit and a rank.\n\n- Need to shuffle the deck.\n\n2. **Dealing Cards:**\n\n- Deal two cards to both the player and the dealer.\n\n- One of the dealer's cards is face down (hidden).\n\n3. **Player's Turn:**\n\n- Display the player's cards and their total.\n\n- Ask the player to hit or stand.\n\n- If hit, give another card; check if total exceeds 21.\n\n- Repeat until the player stands or busts.\n\n4. **Dealer's Turn:**\n\n- Reveal the hidden card.\n\n- Hit until the dealer's total is 17 or higher.\n\n- Check if the dealer busts.\n\n5. **Determine Winner:**\n\n- Compare totals of player and dealer.\n\n- Declare winner or draw.\n\n6. **Game Loop:**\n\n- Allow playing multiple rounds.\n\n- Keep track of the player's money or just play for fun.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume the game is played for fun without money.\n\nLet's start by defining the card structure.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple text-based Blackjack game in C++, we need to simulate the basic rules of the game using standard C++ features. Below is a complete implementation of such a game.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Card Representation:**\n   - Each card has a suit and a rank.\n   - Suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades.\n   - Ranks: 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.\n\n2. **Deck Management:**\n   - Create a deck of 52 cards.\n   - Shuffle the deck to randomize the order.\n   - Deal cards to both the player and the dealer.\n\n3. **Hand Management:**\n   - Calculate the total value of a hand.\n   - Handle Ace's value dynamically (1 or 11).\n\n4. **Game Logic:**\n   - Initial deal: two cards to both player and dealer.\n   - Player's turn: hit (take another card) or stand.\n   - Dealer's turn: hit until total is 17 or higher.\n   - Determine the winner based on the final hand totals.\n\n5. **User Interaction:**\n   - Display the current hand and totals.\n   - Get input from the player for hitting or standing.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cstring>\n\nenum Suit { CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES };\nenum Rank { TWO = 2, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE };\n\nstruct Card {\n    Suit suit;\n    Rank rank;\n};\n\nclass Deck {\npublic:\n    Deck() {\n        for (int s = CLUBS; s <= SPADES; ++s) {\n            for (int r = TWO; r <= ACE; ++r) {\n                cards.push_back({static_cast<Suit>(s), static_cast<Rank>(r)});\n            }\n        }\n        shuffle();\n    }\n\n    Card dealCard() {\n        Card card = cards.back();\n        cards.pop_back();\n        return card;\n    }\n\n    void shuffle() {\n        std::srand(static_cast<unsigned>(time(0)));\n        for (size_t i = cards.size() - 1; i > 0; --i) {\n            size_t j = std::rand() % (i + 1);\n            std::swap(cards[i], cards[j]);\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::vector<Card> cards;\n};\n\nint cardValue(const Card& card) {\n    switch (card.rank) {\n        case JACK: case QUEEN: case KING: return 10;\n        case ACE: return 11;\n        default: return card.rank;\n    }\n}\n\nint handValue(const std::vector<Card>& hand) {\n    int value = 0;\n    int aces = 0;\n    for (const auto& card : hand) {\n        value += cardValue(card);\n        if (card.rank == ACE) aces++;\n    }\n    while (value > 21 && aces > 0) {\n        value -= 10;\n        aces--;\n    }\n    return value;\n}\n\nvoid displayHand(const std::vector<Card>& hand, const std::string& name, bool hideOne) {\n    std::cout << name << \"'s hand: \";\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < hand.size(); ++i) {\n        if (hideOne && i == 0) {\n            std::cout << \"Hidden, \";\n            continue;\n        }\n        const char* suits[] = {\"Clubs\", \"Diamonds\", \"Hearts\", \"Spades\"};\n        const char* ranks[] = {\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \"Jack\", \"Queen\", \"King\", \"Ace\"};\n        std::cout << ranks[hand[i].rank - 2] << \" of \" << suits[hand[i].suit] << \", \";\n    }\n    std::cout << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nbool playerTurn(Deck& deck, std::vector<Card>& playerHand) {\n    while (true) {\n        displayHand(playerHand, \"Player\", false);\n        char choice;\n        std::cout << \"Do you want to hit or stand?
