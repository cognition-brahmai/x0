        "content": "Let's see. So, we have three friends at a restaurant, and they've ordered two pizzas\u2014one with 8 slices and another with 10 slices. That means in total, there are 8 + 10 = 18 slices of pizza. They decide to eat all the slices by taking turns, starting with the first friend, then the second, and finally the third, and then repeating this pattern until all slices are eaten. The question is, who will eat the last slice of pizza?\n\nOkay, so we have 18 slices, and they're taking turns in a cycle of three: first friend, second friend, third friend, and then back to the first friend, and so on.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to see how many complete cycles of three slices there are in 18 slices, and then see if there are any leftover slices after those complete cycles.\n\nSo, 18 divided by 3 is 6. That means there are 6 complete cycles, and each friend gets to eat 6 slices. But wait, that seems off because 3 friends eating 6 slices each would be 18 slices in total, which matches the total number of slices. But the question is about who eats the last slice.\n\nIf they are taking turns in order\u2014first, second, third, first, second, third, and so on\u2014then the last slice, being the 18th slice, would be eaten by the third friend, because in each cycle of three, the third friend eats the third slice, and since 18 is divisible by 3, it should be the third friend who eats the last slice.\n\nBut let me double-check this. If we list out the slices and assign each to a friend:\n\nSlice 1: First friend\n\nSlice 2: Second friend\n\nSlice 3: Third friend\n\nSlice 4: First friend\n\nSlice 5: Second friend\n\nSlice 6: Third friend\n\nSlice 7: First friend\n\nSlice 8: Second friend\n\nSlice 9: Third friend\n\nSlice 10: First friend\n\nSlice 11: Second friend\n\nSlice 12: Third friend\n\nSlice 13: First friend\n\nSlice 14: Second friend\n\nSlice 15: Third friend\n\nSlice 16: First friend\n\nSlice 17: Second friend\n\nSlice 18: Third friend\n\nYes, according to this list, the 18th slice is eaten by the third friend.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of modulo arithmetic. The position of each slice can be mapped to a friend based on the remainder when the slice number is divided by 3.\n\n- If the remainder is 1, it's the first friend.\n\n- If the remainder is 2, it's the second friend.\n\n- If the remainder is 0, it's the third friend.\n\nSo, for slice 18: 18 divided by 3 is 6 with a remainder of 0, which corresponds to the third friend.\n\nThis matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the third friend will eat the last slice of pizza.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{third friend}} \\]"
