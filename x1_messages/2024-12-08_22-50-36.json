        "content": "Let's see. John and Jane are siblings who share a birthday but are two years apart. Today is their birthday, and together they are 30 years old. I need to figure out how old each one is.\n\nFirst, since they share a birthday but are two years apart, that means one is two years older than the other. Let's say John is the older one, so John is two years older than Jane.\n\nLet\u2019s use some variables to represent their ages. Let\u2019s say Jane\u2019s age is x years. Since John is two years older, his age would be x + 2 years.\n\nNow, their combined age is 30 years. So, if we add their ages together, we get:\n\nx + (x + 2) = 30\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2x + 2 = 30\n\nNow, subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n2x = 28\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 14\n\nSo, Jane is 14 years old, and John, being two years older, is 16 years old.\n\nBut wait, let\u2019s double-check that. If Jane is 14 and John is 16, their combined age is 14 + 16 = 30, which matches the information given. Also, they are two years apart in age, which also matches.\n\nAlternatively, if Jane was the older one, then John would be x - 2 years old, and the equation would be:\n\nx + (x - 2) = 30\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2x - 2 = 30\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n2x = 32\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 16\n\nSo, Jane would be 16 and John would be 14. Their combined age is still 30, and they are two years apart.\n\nWait a minute, in the first scenario, John is older than Jane, and in the second, Jane is older than John. But the problem states that they are two years apart, without specifying who is older. So both scenarios are possible.\n\nBut in the first part, it says \"John and Jane are siblings who share a birthday but are two years apart.\" It doesn't specify who is older, only that they are two years apart.\n\nHowever, in the way I approached it, I assumed John was older, but it could be either way.\n\nBut in both cases, their ages add up to 30, and the age difference is 2 years.\n\nSo, possible solutions are:\n\n- John is 16 and Jane is 14\n\n- John is 14 and Jane is 16\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a specific answer, or maybe there's more information to consider.\n\nWait, the problem says \"today is their birthday,\" which means that on their birthday, their ages are being considered.\n\nBut since they share the same birthday, they should be the same age, but the problem states they are two years apart.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If they share the same birthday, but are two years apart, then one is exactly two years older than the other.\n\nSo, for example, if Jane was born on January 1, 2000, and John was born on January 1, 1998, then on January 1, 2022, Jane would be 22 and John would be 24.\n\nBut in this problem, their combined age is 30.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is set in a specific year, but without loss of generality, we can assume that on their birthday today, their ages are x and x+2, and x + (x+2) = 30.\n\nSo, solving for x:\n\n2x + 2 = 30\n\n2x = 28\n\nx = 14\n\nTherefore, Jane is 14 and John is 16.\n\nAlternatively, if John is x and Jane is x+2, then:\n\nx + (x + 2) = 30\n\nSame as above.\n\nSo, it seems the ages are 14 and 16.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nWait, the problem says \"today is their birthday,\" which means that recently they both had their birthday, so their ages have just increased.\n\nBut, actually, on their birthday, they have already aged to their new year.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider their ages in years.\n\nIf today is their birthday, then both have just turned their new age.\n\nSo, if Jane is x years old today, then John, being two years older, is x + 2 years old today.\n\nTheir combined age is 30, so x + (x + 2) = 30.\n\nWhich again leads to x = 14 and John = 16.\n\nAlternatively, if John is x and Jane is x + 2, then x + (x + 2) = 30, same as above.\n\nWait, unless the problem is considering something else, like the difference in their ages in months or something, but no, it says they are two years apart.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the exact date, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nPerhaps the problem is straightforward, and the answer is that one is 14 and the other is 16.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose that they share the same birthday, but one is exactly two years older.\n\nIn that case, their age difference is always two years, regardless of the day.\n\nSo, on their birthday, the age difference remains two years.\n\nTherefore, the only variables are their individual ages, which must add up to 30, with a difference of 2 years.\n\nSo, setting up the equations:\n\nLet j = John's age\n\nLet n = Jane's age\n\nWe have:\n\nj + n = 30\n\nj - n = 2 or n - j = 2, depending on who is older.\n\nFirst, assume j - n = 2\n\nThen, j = n + 2\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n(n + 2) + n = 30\n\n2n + 2 = 30\n\n2n = 28\n\nn = 14\n\nThen j = 14 + 2 = 16\n\nAlternatively, if n - j = 2, then n = j + 2\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\nj + (j + 2) = 30\n\n2j + 2 = 30\n\n2j = 28\n\nj = 14\n\nThen n = 14 + 2 = 16\n\nSo, in both cases, the ages are 14 and 16.\n\nTherefore, one sibling is 14 years old, and the other is 16 years old.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify who is older, both assignments are possible.\n\nSo, the answer is that John and Jane are 14 and 16 years old, respectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14 \\text{ and } 16} \\]"
