        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of candies: type A and type B. Type A costs $1.50 each, and type B costs $2.00 each. The customer buys a total of 15 candies and spends $25. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of type A candies.\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of type B candies.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candies is 15.\n\n2. The total cost is $25.\n\nSo, we can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nThe first equation is about the total number of candies:\n\n\\[ a + b = 15 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50a + 2.00b = 25 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 15 - b \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 1.50(15 - b) + 2.00b = 25 \\]\n\nLet's distribute the 1.50:\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 15 - 1.50b + 2.00b = 25 \\]\n\n\\[ 22.5 - 1.50b + 2.00b = 25 \\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[ 22.5 + (2.00b - 1.50b) = 25 \\]\n\n\\[ 22.5 + 0.50b = 25 \\]\n\nSubtract 22.5 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.50b = 2.5 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50 to solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{2.5}{0.50} \\]\n\n\\[ b = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 5 type B candies.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation \\( a = 15 - b \\):\n\n\\[ a = 15 - 5 \\]\n\n\\[ a = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 10 type A candies and 5 type B candies.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it's correct.\n\nFirst, total candies:\n\n\\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \\]\n\nThat checks out.\n\nNext, total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 10 + 2.00 \\times 5 = 15 + 10 = 25 \\]\n\nThat also matches.\n\nSo, the solution is correct. The customer bought 10 type A candies and 5 type B candies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ type A candies and } 5 \\text{ type B candies}} \\]"
