However, Venus has a significantly different atmosphere, which is much thicker than Earth's and primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. This dense atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead."
