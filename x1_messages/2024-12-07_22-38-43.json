        "content": "Let's see. There's this store that reduces the price of a product by 20% each week for three consecutive weeks. The original price is $100, and I need to find out what the final price will be after the third week.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand what it means to reduce the price by 20% each week. Does it mean that each week, the store takes 20% off the original price, or 20% off the price from the previous week?\n\nI think it's the latter, meaning that each week, the discount is applied to the price from the previous week. So, it's like a cumulative discount.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\nWeek 1:\n\nOriginal price: $100\n\nDiscount: 20% of $100 = 0.20 * 100 = $20\n\nSo, price after Week 1: $100 - $20 = $80\n\nWeek 2:\n\nNow, the price is $80.\n\nDiscount: 20% of $80 = 0.20 * 80 = $16\n\nSo, price after Week 2: $80 - $16 = $64\n\nWeek 3:\n\nNow, the price is $64.\n\nDiscount: 20% of $64 = 0.20 * 64 = $12.80\n\nSo, price after Week 3: $64 - $12.80 = $51.20\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But maybe there's a better way to calculate this without doing it step by step.\n\nI recall that when you have consecutive percentage discounts, you can multiply the remaining percentages.\n\nMeaning, each week, the product is being sold at 80% of the previous week's price, since 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, after three weeks, the final price would be the original price multiplied by 0.80 three times.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nOriginal price: $100\n\nAfter Week 1: $100 * 0.80 = $80\n\nAfter Week 2: $80 * 0.80 = $64\n\nAfter Week 3: $64 * 0.80 = $51.20\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could do $100 * (0.80)^3\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.80^3 = 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80 = 0.512\n\nSo, $100 * 0.512 = $51.20\n\nSame result.\n\nI think $51.20 is the final price after the third week.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst week: 20% off $100 is $20, so $100 - $20 = $80. That seems correct.\n\nSecond week: 20% off $80 is $16, so $80 - $16 = $64. Correct.\n\nThird week: 20% off $64 is $12.80, so $64 - $12.80 = $51.20. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, $100 * (0.80)^3 = $51.20. Consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{51.20} \\]"
