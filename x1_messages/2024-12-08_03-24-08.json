        "content": "So, let's see what we've got here. There are 4 cats in a room, and each cat can catch 3 mice in an hour. That means, in total, the cats can catch 4 times 3, which is 12 mice in an hour. Right?\n\nNow, each mouse eats 2 pieces of cheese per day. So, if 12 mice are caught, that means those 12 mice would have eaten 12 times 2, which is 24 pieces of cheese per day.\n\nBut the question is asking how many pieces of cheese will be saved after one hour. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky because the mice only eat over the course of a day, not an hour.\n\nMaybe I need to think about it differently. If each mouse eats 2 pieces of cheese per day, and there are 24 hours in a day, then per hour, each mouse eats 2 divided by 24, which is about 0.0833 pieces of cheese per hour.\n\nSo, if each mouse eats 0.0833 pieces per hour, and 12 mice are caught, then the total cheese saved per hour would be 12 times 0.0833, which is approximately 1 piece of cheese.\n\nWait, that seems too low. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try another approach. If each mouse eats 2 pieces of cheese per day, and a day has 24 hours, then the rate at which each mouse eats cheese is 2 pieces per 24 hours.\n\nSo, the eating rate per mouse is 2/24 = 1/12 pieces per hour.\n\nTherefore, 12 mice would eat 12 * (1/12) = 1 piece per hour.\n\nSo, if 12 mice are caught, that means they would have eaten 1 piece of cheese in an hour, which is now saved.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mice only eat at certain times, but the problem doesn't specify. It just says each mouse eats 2 pieces per day.\n\nI think the reasonable assumption is that the mice eat uniformly throughout the day, so per hour, it's a consistent rate.\n\nSo, based on that, 12 mice would eat 1 piece per hour, and thus, by catching them, that 1 piece is saved.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider that the mice are only eaten if they are not caught. Wait, no, the mice are being caught by the cats, so they are removed from eating the cheese.\n\nSo, yes, the cheese saved would be the amount that those 12 mice would have eaten in that hour.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1 piece of cheese saved per hour.\n\nBut, maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me check again.\n\nIf each mouse eats 2 pieces per day, and there are 12 mice caught, then in a day, those 12 mice would have eaten 24 pieces.\n\nBut per hour, since there are 24 hours in a day, the hourly consumption per mouse is 2/24 = 1/12 pieces.\n\nSo, 12 mice would eat 12 * (1/12) = 1 piece per hour.\n\nTherefore, by catching them, 1 piece is saved per hour.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mice only eat at night or something, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nI think the assumption of uniform eating rate is fair.\n\nSo, the final answer should be that 1 piece of cheese will be saved after one hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
