        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a Java class that acts as a simple calculator. This class will have methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll also make sure to handle the error case when someone tries to divide by zero.\n\nFirst, we'll define a class called `SimpleCalculator`. Inside this class, we'll create four methods:\n\n1. `add` - to add two numbers\n2. `subtract` - to subtract one number from another\n3. `multiply` - to multiply two numbers\n4. `divide` - to divide one number by another\n\nFor the division method, we need to handle the scenario where the denominator is zero, as division by zero is undefined and would cause a runtime error. To handle this, we'll use a try-catch block to catch the `ArithmeticException` that occurs when dividing by zero and provide a user-friendly error message.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```java\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n\n    // Method to add two numbers\n    public double add(double num1, double num2) {\n        return num1 + num2;\n    }\n\n    // Method to subtract one number from another\n    public double subtract(double num1, double num2) {\n        return num1 - num2;\n    }\n\n    // Method to multiply two numbers\n    public double multiply(double num1, double num2) {\n        return num1 * num2;\n    }\n\n    // Method to divide one number by another with error handling for division by zero\n    public double divide(double num1, double num2) {\n        if (num2 == 0) {\n            throw new ArithmeticException(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n        }\n        return num1 / num2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply` methods are straightforward and perform their respective operations.\n\n- The `divide` method checks if the denominator (`num2`) is zero. If it is, it throws an `ArithmeticException` with a message indicating that division by zero is not allowed. If `num2` is not zero, it proceeds to perform the division.\n\nTo use this calculator, you can create an instance of the `SimpleCalculator` class and call its methods with the desired numbers. Here's an example of how you might use this class:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SimpleCalculator calculator = new SimpleCalculator();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Addition of 10 and 5: \" + calculator.add(10, 5));\n        System.out.println(\"Subtraction of 10 and 5: \" + calculator.subtract(10, 5));\n        System.out.println(\"Multiplication of 10 and 5: \" + calculator.multiply(10, 5));\n\n        try {\n            System.out.println(\"Division of 10 by 5: \" + calculator.divide(10, 5));\n            System.out.println(\"Division of 10 by 0: \" + calculator.divide(10, 0));\n        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We create an instance of `SimpleCalculator`.\n- We call the `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply` methods with sample values and print the results.\n- For the `divide` method, we attempt to divide by both a non-zero number and zero. The division by zero throws an `ArithmeticException`, which we catch and print the error message.\n\nThis way, the calculator handles basic arithmetic operations and gracefully manages errors when invalid operations are attempted."
