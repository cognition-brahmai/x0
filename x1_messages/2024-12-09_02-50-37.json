        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1000 widgets per hour, and each widget has a 2% chance of being defective. I need to find out how many non-defective widgets are produced in an 8-hour workday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of widgets produced in 8 hours. That should be straightforward: 1000 widgets per hour times 8 hours.\n\nTotal widgets = 1000 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 8000 widgets\n\nNow, each widget has a 2% chance of being defective. So, the defective widgets would be 2% of the total widgets produced.\n\nDefective widgets = 2% of 8000 = 0.02 * 8000 = 160 widgets\n\nTo find the number of non-defective widgets, I can subtract the defective ones from the total production.\n\nNon-defective widgets = Total widgets - Defective widgets = 8000 - 160 = 7840 widgets\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the probability of a widget being non-defective and then multiply that by the total production.\n\nThe probability of a widget being non-defective is 100% - 2% = 98%, or 0.98.\n\nSo, non-defective widgets = 0.98 * 8000 = 7840 widgets\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Is the defect rate independent for each widget? Probably yes, assuming that the production process doesn't have any memory or influence between widgets.\n\nAlso, is there any chance that multiple defects could affect the count? For example, could one defect cause another? But the problem says each widget has a 2% chance of being defective, so I think they're considering defects independently.\n\nAnother thing to consider: is the production rate constant throughout the 8 hours? The problem says 1000 widgets per hour, so I assume it's constant.\n\nAlright, so based on this, I think 7840 non-defective widgets is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any possibility of reworking defective widgets within the same workday? The problem doesn't mention anything about reworking, so I assume that defective widgets are not being repaired within the 8-hour period.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"produced in an 8-hour workday,\" so I'm assuming that's the total production time, and there are no breaks or downtime affecting the production rate.\n\nGiven all that, my calculation should hold.\n\nSo, the final answer is 7840 non-defective widgets produced in an 8-hour workday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7840} \\]"
