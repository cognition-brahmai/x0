        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 10 red balls, 8 blue balls, and 12 green balls. So, in total, there are 10 + 8 + 12 = 30 balls in the box. The question is, if I pick one ball at random, what's the probability that it's not a green ball?\n\nOkay, probability. I remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 30.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where I don't pick a green ball. So, that means I can pick either a red ball or a blue ball.\n\nThere are 10 red balls and 8 blue balls, so the total number of non-green balls is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a non-green ball is 18/30.\n\nWait, I can simplify that fraction. Both 18 and 30 are divisible by 6.\n\n18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n\n30 \u00f7 6 = 5\n\nSo, 18/30 simplifies to 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of complementary probability. The probability of not picking a green ball is equal to 1 minus the probability of picking a green ball.\n\nThe probability of picking a green ball is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 12/30. Simplifying that, 12 \u00f7 6 = 2 and 30 \u00f7 6 = 5, so 12/30 is 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the probability is 3/5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check.\n\nTotal balls: 10 red + 8 blue + 12 green = 30 balls.\n\nNon-green balls: 10 red + 8 blue = 18 balls.\n\nProbability of not picking green: 18/30 = 3/5.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using decimal or percentage form, 3/5 is 0.6, or 60%.\n\nBut the question didn't specify the form of the answer, so 3/5 is fine.\n\nI think that's it. The probability of picking a ball that is not green is 3/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
