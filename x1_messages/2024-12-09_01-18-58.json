        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: if you flip a coin three times, what's the chance of getting heads all three times? Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basics of coin flipping. A fair coin has two sides: heads and tails. Each flip is independent, meaning the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the others. So, each time I flip the coin, there's a 50% chance of getting heads and a 50% chance of getting tails.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of getting heads in all three flips. Since each flip is independent, I can find the total probability by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nProbability of heads on first flip: 1/2\n\nProbability of heads on second flip: 1/2\n\nProbability of heads on third flip: 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of all three being heads is:\n\n1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to list all possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times. Each flip has two possible results, so for three flips, there are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes. Let's list them:\n\n1. HHH\n\n2. HHT\n\n3. HTH\n\n4. HTT\n\n5. THH\n\n6. THT\n\n7. TTH\n\n8. TTT\n\nOkay, so there are eight possible sequences, and only one of them is all heads (HHH). Therefore, the probability should be 1 out of 8, which is 1/8 or 12.5%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the order of the flips. Does the order matter here? The problem says \"getting heads all three times,\" which implies that all flips should be heads, regardless of the order. But in this case, since we're looking for all heads, the order is already specified.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it in terms of combinations. The number of ways to get k successes in n trials is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nIn this case, n = 3 flips, and k = 3 heads.\n\nSo, C(3, 3) = 1 way.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 2^3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/8, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the probability for each flip:\n\n- First flip: 1/2 chance of heads\n\n- Second flip: 1/2 chance of heads\n\n- Third flip: 1/2 chance of heads\n\nSince the flips are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the possibility of biased coins. The problem doesn't specify that the coin is fair, but typically, if nothing is mentioned, it's safe to assume it's a fair coin. So, I'll stick with the 1/8 probability.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability of getting at least one tails in three flips and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of getting all heads.\n\nThe probability of getting at least one tails is 1 - probability of all heads.\n\nBut wait, that would give me the same result: 1 - 1/8 = 7/8 for at least one tails, so the probability of all heads is 1/8.\n\nThis consistency reinforces my answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other angle I should look at this from. Maybe using binomial probability.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (3 flips)\n\n- k is the number of successes (3 heads)\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (1/2 for heads)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(3) = C(3, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^0 = 1 * 1/8 * 1 = 1/8\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently from multiple perspectives.\n\nSo, the probability of getting heads all three times when flipping a coin is 1/8 or 12.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
