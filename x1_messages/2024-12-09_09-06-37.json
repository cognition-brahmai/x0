        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a person who drinks 8 glasses of water each day, and we need to find out how many gallons of water that amounts to in a month with 30 days. The assumption is that 1 glass equals 8 ounces.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the units involved here. We have glasses, ounces, gallons, and days. So, I should probably start by figuring out how much water the person drinks in ounces per day, then maybe find out the monthly consumption in ounces, and finally convert that to gallons.\n\nOkay, starting with the daily consumption:\n\nThe person drinks 8 glasses per day, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the daily consumption in ounces is:\n\n8 glasses/day \u00d7 8 ounces/glass = 64 ounces/day\n\nNow, for a 30-day month, the total consumption in ounces would be:\n\n64 ounces/day \u00d7 30 days = 1920 ounces\n\nNext, I need to convert ounces to gallons. I recall that there are 128 ounces in a gallon. So, to find out how many gallons are in 1920 ounces, I can divide the total ounces by the number of ounces per gallon:\n\n1920 ounces \u00f7 128 ounces/gallon = 15 gallons\n\nSo, the person drinks 15 gallons of water in a 30-day month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could find out how many gallons the person drinks per day and then multiply by 30.\n\nFirst, find the daily consumption in gallons:\n\n8 glasses/day \u00d7 8 ounces/glass = 64 ounces/day\n\nThen, convert ounces to gallons:\n\n64 ounces \u00f7 128 ounces/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day\n\nNow, for 30 days:\n\n0.5 gallons/day \u00d7 30 days = 15 gallons\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. Good, that gives me more confidence in the answer.\n\nAnother way could be to find out how many glasses are in a gallon and then see how many gallons are consumed in a month.\n\nFirst, since 1 gallon = 128 ounces, and 1 glass = 8 ounces, then the number of glasses per gallon is:\n\n128 ounces/gallon \u00f7 8 ounces/glass = 16 glasses/gallon\n\nThe person drinks 8 glasses per day, so the daily consumption in gallons is:\n\n8 glasses/day \u00f7 16 glasses/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day\n\nOver 30 days:\n\n0.5 gallons/day \u00d7 30 days = 15 gallons\n\nAgain, the same answer. Seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the size of a glass is different in some contexts, but the question specifies 1 glass = 8 ounces, so I'll stick with that.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the month has exactly 30 days, as specified, so no need to adjust for different month lengths.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 15 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
