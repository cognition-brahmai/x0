        "content": "You're referring to table salt, which is commonly used in cooking and has a pungent smell and taste. Table salt is primarily composed of sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a crystalline solid at room temperature. It is widely used in various cuisines around the world to enhance the flavor of foods. Additionally, salt plays a crucial role in food preservation due to its ability to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. In its natural form, salt can be found in sea salt, rock salt, and other mineral deposits. It's also worth noting that excessive consumption of salt can lead to health issues such as hypertension, so it's important to consume it in moderation. Is there anything specific you'd like to know about salt or its uses?"
