        "content": "So there are 4 apples and 6 oranges on a table, making a total of 10 fruits. I need to find the probability that if I pick two fruits at random, both of them will be apples.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 2 fruits out of 10 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 2.\n\nSo, total number of ways to pick 2 fruits from 10 is C(10, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 possible ways to pick any 2 fruits from the 10 fruits.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick 2 apples from the 4 apples available.\n\nSo, that would be C(4, 2).\n\nCalculating C(4, 2):\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2!)) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to pick 2 apples from the 4 apples.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both fruits picked are apples is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 6 / 45.\n\nI can simplify that fraction: 6 \u00f7 3 = 2, and 45 \u00f7 3 = 15, so it's 2/15.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of sequential probability.\n\nThe probability that the first fruit picked is an apple is 4 out of 10, since there are 4 apples and 10 fruits in total.\n\nSo, P(first apple) = 4/10.\n\nThen, given that the first fruit was an apple, there are now 3 apples left and 9 fruits in total.\n\nSo, P(second apple | first apple) = 3/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both fruits are apples is P(first apple) \u00d7 P(second apple | first apple) = (4/10) \u00d7 (3/9) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (10 \u00d7 9) = 12 / 90 = 2/15.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/15.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the probability directly using permutations if I consider the order of picking.\n\nBut in combinations, order doesn't matter, which is appropriate for this problem since we're only interested in the types of fruits, not the order in which they're picked.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of picking two apples in a specific order and then adjust for the fact that order doesn't matter.\n\nBut I think the combination approach is the most straightforward.\n\nLet me see if there's any other angle I should consider to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nIs there any dependency or arrangement that could affect the probability?\n\nIn this case, since the fruits are picked randomly and without replacement, the combination approach should suffice.\n\nAlso, assuming that all fruits are equally likely to be picked, which seems reasonable unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, I think 2/15 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of ways to pick 2 apples out of 4 and 2 oranges out of 6, but that's not necessary since the question is specifically about picking 2 apples.\n\nWait, no, it's about picking 2 fruits and both being apples.\n\nI've already calculated that.\n\nLet me see if I can use another method, like calculating the probability of not picking two apples and then subtracting from 1.\n\nBut that would be more complicated in this case.\n\nNo, actually, that might not be the best approach here.\n\nBecause not picking two apples includes picking one apple and one orange, or picking two oranges.\n\nBut since the question is directly about picking two apples, the initial approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the hypergeometric distribution formula.\n\nThe hypergeometric distribution calculates the probability of k successes (in this case, picking apples) in n draws (picking fruits) from a finite population without replacement.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (total fruits: 10)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (apples: 4)\n\n- n is the number of draws (fruits picked: 2)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (apples picked: 2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = [C(4, 2) * C(10 - 4, 2 - 2)] / C(10, 2)\n\n= [C(4, 2) * C(6, 0)] / C(10, 2)\n\n= [6 * 1] / 45\n\n= 6 / 45\n\n= 2 / 15\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 2/15 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem that could lead to a different answer.\n\nFor example, maybe considering that the fruits are distinct in some way, but since the problem doesn't specify any differences between fruits of the same type, I think treating them as indistinct within their types is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if the fruits were labeled or had different probabilities of being picked, that would change things, but again, the problem states they're randomly picked, so equal probability for each fruit.\n\nTherefore, the probability remains 2/15.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{15}} \\]"
