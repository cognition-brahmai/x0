        "content": "So the company starts with 120 employees. They first increase their workforce by 25%, and then they plan to increase it by an additional 10%. I need to find out how many employees they will have after both increases.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the 25% increase. To find 25% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.25.\n\n120 * 0.25 = 30\n\nSo, the first increase adds 30 employees. Now, I'll add that to the original 120 employees.\n\n120 + 30 = 150\n\nNow, the company has 150 employees after the first increase. Next, they plan to increase this number by an additional 10%. So, I need to find 10% of 150.\n\n150 * 0.10 = 15\n\nSo, the second increase adds 15 employees. Now, I'll add that to the 150 employees.\n\n150 + 15 = 165\n\nTherefore, after both increases, the company will have 165 employees.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the overall percentage increase. First, they increase by 25%, and then by an additional 10%. To find the total percentage increase, I can't just add 25% and 10% because the second increase is applied to the new amount, not the original.\n\nSo, perhaps I can calculate the overall multiplication factor. First, a 25% increase is the same as multiplying by 1 + 0.25 = 1.25. Then, a 10% increase is the same as multiplying by 1 + 0.10 = 1.10.\n\nSo, the overall multiplication factor is 1.25 * 1.10.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1.25 * 1.10 = 1.375\n\nSo, the overall increase is a multiplication by 1.375, which is the same as a 37.5% increase.\n\nNow, if I apply this overall multiplication factor to the original number of employees:\n\n120 * 1.375 = 165\n\nSo, again, I get 165 employees.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total increase percentage and then apply it to the original number.\n\nThe first increase is 25%, and the second is 10% on top of the already increased amount.\n\nSo, the total increase is not just 25% + 10% = 35%, because the 10% is applied to the increased amount.\n\nInstead, the total increase is:\n\nOriginal amount * (1 + first increase) * (1 + second increase) - original amount\n\nWhich is:\n\n120 * 1.25 * 1.10 - 120 = 120 * 1.375 - 120 = 165 - 120 = 45\n\nWait, no. That's the increase amount, not the total amount.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the total amount after both increases is 120 * 1.25 * 1.10 = 165, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the company will have 165 employees after both increases.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the two increases separately.\n\nFirst increase: 25% of 120 is 30, so 120 + 30 = 150.\n\nSecond increase: 10% of 150 is 15, so 150 + 15 = 165.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to add the percentages directly, which is incorrect, I would get 25% + 10% = 35%, and 35% of 120 is 42, so 120 + 42 = 162, which is not the correct answer.\n\nSo, it's important to apply the increases sequentially, not by just adding the percentages.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for compound percentage increases.\n\nThe formula for two successive percentage increases is:\n\nTotal increase = x + y + (x * y)/100\n\nWhere x is the first percentage increase and y is the second percentage increase.\n\nSo, x = 25% and y = 10%.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal increase = 25 + 10 + (25 * 10)/100 = 35 + 250/100 = 35 + 2.5 = 37.5%\n\nSo, the total increase is 37.5%.\n\nNow, applying this to the original number of employees:\n\n120 * (1 + 37.5/100) = 120 * 1.375 = 165\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the company will have 165 employees after both increases.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The answer is 165 employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]"
