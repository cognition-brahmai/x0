        "content": "So, there's this problem here: In a village, there are 100 houses. Every house has a dog, and every dog has 3 fleas. The question is, how many legs are in the village?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, we need to figure out what elements are present in the village and how many legs each of them has.\n\n1. Houses: Well, houses don't have legs, right? So, they don't contribute to the total leg count.\n\n2. Dogs: Each house has one dog. Since there are 100 houses, there are 100 dogs. Now, dogs typically have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs from dogs would be 100 dogs \u00d7 4 legs/dog = 400 legs.\n\n3. Fleas: Each dog has 3 fleas. So, with 100 dogs, that's 100 \u00d7 3 = 300 fleas. Fleas are tiny insects that usually have 6 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs from fleas would be 300 fleas \u00d7 6 legs/flea = 1800 legs.\n\nNow, adding up the legs from dogs and fleas: 400 legs (dogs) + 1800 legs (fleas) = 2200 legs.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let's see, are there any other creatures or things in the village that might have legs? The problem mentions houses, dogs, and fleas. Houses don't have legs, dogs have 4, and fleas have 6. So, unless there are people in the houses, but the problem doesn't specify any people, so perhaps we shouldn't include them.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there might be people in the houses. If each house has people, and people have 2 legs each, then we would need to know how many people per house to calculate that. However, the problem doesn't provide that information, so it's probably safe to assume that only dogs and fleas have legs in this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the houses have legs, like in some storybooks or cartoons, but in reality, houses are built on foundations and don't have legs. So, it's reasonable to exclude legs from houses.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs in the village is 2200.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations to make sure.\n\n- Dogs: 100 dogs \u00d7 4 legs = 400 legs\n\n- Fleas: 100 dogs \u00d7 3 fleas/dog = 300 fleas \u00d7 6 legs/flea = 1800 legs\n\n- Total: 400 + 1800 = 2200 legs\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the legs per house.\n\nEach house has:\n\n- 1 dog with 4 legs\n\n- 3 fleas with 6 legs each, so 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 legs\n\n- Total per house: 4 + 18 = 22 legs\n\nThen, for 100 houses: 100 \u00d7 22 = 2200 legs\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think 2200 is the correct total number of legs in the village.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2200} \\]"
