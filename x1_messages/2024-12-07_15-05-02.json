        "content": "So I have this problem: I need to calculate the probability of drawing two red cards from a standard deck of playing cards without replacement. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards in total. Half of them are red, and half are black. So, there are 26 red cards and 26 black cards.\n\nNow, the problem says \"without replacement,\" which means that once I draw the first card, it stays out of the deck, and the second card is drawn from the remaining cards.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red cards in a row without replacement would be the probability of drawing a red card on the first draw multiplied by the probability of drawing another red card on the second draw, given that the first card was red.\n\nLet me write this down:\n\nP(two red cards) = P(first card red) * P(second card red | first card red)\n\nFirst, P(first card red). Since there are 26 red cards out of 52 total cards, that's 26/52, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNext, P(second card red | first card red). This means, given that the first card was red, what's the probability that the second card is also red.\n\nIf the first card was red, then there are now 25 red cards left and a total of 51 cards remaining in the deck. So, that's 25/51.\n\nNow, multiply these two probabilities together:\n\nP(two red cards) = (1/2) * (25/51)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 1/2 is 0.5, and 25/51 is approximately 0.4902.\n\nSo, 0.5 * 0.4902 is approximately 0.2451.\n\nBut maybe it's better to keep it as a fraction.\n\nSo, (1/2) * (25/51) = 25/102.\n\nNow, is 25/102 in its simplest form? Let's check if 25 and 102 have any common factors.\n\n25 is 5*5, and 102 is 2*3*17, so no common factors. Therefore, 25/102 is the simplest form.\n\nSo, the probability is 25/102.\n\nAlternatively, I can confirm this by using combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 cards from 52 is C(52,2), which is (52*51)/2 = 1326.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 red cards from 26 red cards is C(26,2), which is (26*25)/2 = 325.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 325 / 1326.\n\nSimplify 325/1326.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 13:\n\n325 \u00f7 13 = 25\n\n1326 \u00f7 13 = 102\n\nSo, again, 25/102.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing two red cards without replacement is 25/102.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{102}} \\]"
