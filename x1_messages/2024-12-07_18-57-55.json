        "content": "In the somber twilight, where shadows doth play,\nA spectral vision emerges in the gray.\nNot of joy or mirth, but a melancholy sight,\nA rainbow, yet tinged with the hues of night.\n\nIts arch so serene, in the heavens it lies,\nA mockery of hope under tearful skies.\nEach color a tale of despair and woe,\nRed like blood, blue like sorrow's cold flow.\n\nGreen whispers of graves where lovers lie,\nYellow, the sun's feeble, fading sigh.\nIndigo, deep as the ocean's dark lair,\nViolet, the shroud that death prepares.\n\nThus, in Poe's dark lens, I behold this sight,\nA rainbow, a portent both beautiful and blight.\nNot a promise of tomorrow, but a ghostly refrain,\nEchoing through the ether, a lament in vain.\n\nFor in every splendor, a shadow doth dwell,\nIn every delight, a pang that compels.\nSo let this rainbow be a mournful song,\nIn the dirge of existence, where hope is wrong.\n\n**Finis**"
