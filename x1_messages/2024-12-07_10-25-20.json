        "content": "So, a bee visits 20 flowers in one minute, and we want to know how many flowers it visits in a whole day if it works non-stop. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to know how many minutes there are in an hour. We know that:\n\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\nSo, if the bee visits 20 flowers per minute, in one hour it would visit:\n\n20 flowers/minute \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 1200 flowers/hour\n\nNow, there are 24 hours in a day, so in one day, the bee would visit:\n\n1200 flowers/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 28,800 flowers/day\n\nWait a minute, but bees can't really work non-stop for 24 hours a day, can they? They must need some rest or sleep or something. But the question says \"if it works non-stop,\" so we have to assume that it's working continuously without any breaks.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check our calculations.\n\nStarting with:\n\n- 20 flowers/minute\n\n- 60 minutes/hour\n\n- 24 hours/day\n\nSo, total flowers in a day = 20 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 24\n\nLet's compute that again:\n\n20 \u00d7 60 = 1200\n\n1200 \u00d7 24 = 28,800\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate it in seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\nFirst, find out how many flowers per second:\n\n20 flowers/minute \u00f7 60 seconds/minute = 0.333... flowers/second\n\nBut that seems unnecessary since we already have it in minutes and hours.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about it in terms of seconds, but I think the minute-to-hour approach is simpler and less prone to error.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 28,800 flowers in a day if the bee works non-stop.\n\nBut just to think about it realistically, bees do take rests and sleep, but according to the problem, we're assuming it works non-stop, so our calculation should be fine.\n\nOne more thing to consider: does the bee visit the same flowers over and over, or does it visit distinct flowers? The problem doesn't specify, but I think it's safe to assume that it's visiting different flowers each time, especially since it's visiting so many in a day.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the bee visits 28,800 flowers in a day if it works non-stop.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28800} \\]"
