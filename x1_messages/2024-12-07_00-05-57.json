        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 apples in the basket to start with. If I take away 4 apples, that means I'm removing 4 from the original 12. So, 12 minus 4 would be 8 apples left. Then, if I put back 2 apples, I'm adding those 2 back into the basket. So, 8 plus 2 would equal 10 apples. Therefore, there would be 10 apples left in the basket.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If I take away 4 apples, that's subtraction, and then putting back 2 is addition. So, overall, it's like subtracting 4 and then adding 2 to the original number. So, 12 - 4 + 2. Let me calculate that: 12 minus 4 is 8, and 8 plus 2 is indeed 10.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as net change. Taking away 4 and then putting back 2 means the net change is minus 2 apples. So, 12 minus 2 would be 10. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation. For example, maybe the apples I put back are among the ones I took away, or perhaps there are different types of apples. But the problem doesn't specify any of that, so I think the straightforward arithmetic approach is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10 apples left in the basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
