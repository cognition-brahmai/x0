        "content": "In the scenario where a plane crashes exactly on the border between the United States and Canada, determining where to bury the survivors would depend on several factors, including legal jurisdiction, international agreements, and practical considerations.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that survivors of a plane crash are living individuals, and burial is a procedure for the deceased. Therefore, the immediate focus should be on providing medical assistance and care to the survivors rather than considering burial sites.\n\nAssuming the question is intended to pertain to the deceased passengers and crew members from the crash, the location for their burial would need to be determined based on various legal and logistical factors.\n\n1. **Jurisdiction and Legal Considerations:**\n   - **Flag State Regulations:** The country in which the aircraft is registered (the flag state) may have laws governing the handling of remains in the event of an accident.\n   - **International Treaties:** There are several international treaties and agreements that pertain to aviation safety and accident investigations, such as the Chicago Convention and the Geneva Convention on International Civil Aviation. These may influence jurisdiction over the accident site and the handling of remains.\n   - **Border Agreements:** The United States and Canada have a close relationship and numerous bilateral agreements. There may be specific protocols in place for handling incidents occurring on the border.\n\n2. **Practical Considerations:**\n   - **Location of the Crash Site:** If the crash site is exactly on the border, it may be necessary to coordinate efforts between both countries' emergency response teams.\n   - **Accessibility:** The accessibility of the crash site could influence where the remains are temporarily handled and ultimately buried.\n   - **Cultural and Religious Practices:** The wishes of the victims' families and their cultural or religious practices should be considered in determining the burial location.\n\n3. **Coordination Between Authorities:**\n   - **Notification of Next of Kin:** Both countries would likely work together to notify the next of kin and handle the repatriation of remains according to family wishes.\n   - **Funeral and Burial Arrangements:** Families may choose to have the remains buried in their home country or in a location of their choosing. Alternatively, if remains cannot be identified or if families cannot be located, there may be arrangements for burial in a designated location in either country.\n\n4. **Humanitarian Considerations:**\n   - **Dignified Handling:** Ensuring that the remains are handled with dignity and respect is paramount.\n   - **Memorialization:** There may be a need for a memorial or a common burial site for unidentified remains.\n\nIn summary, the burial of deceased victims from a plane crash occurring on the border between the United States and Canada would require coordinated efforts between both countries' authorities, taking into account legal regulations, international agreements, and the wishes of the victims' families. The primary focus, however, should be on providing immediate assistance to survivors and ensuring the proper handling and respect for the deceased."
