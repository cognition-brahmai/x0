        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 10 red balls, 8 blue balls, and 12 green balls. That means the total number of balls is 10 + 8 + 12, which is 30 balls. The question is asking for the probability that if I pick three balls at random without looking, all three will be the same color.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where all three balls are the same color, and the total possible outcomes are all the different ways I can pick any three balls from the box.\n\nSo, let's start by figuring out the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm picking three balls out of 30, and the order doesn't matter (because it's just about the colors, not the order), I should use combinations here. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose three balls from 30 is C(30, 3). Plugging in the numbers:\n\nC(30, 3) = 30! / (3!(30 - 3)!) = (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 4060.\n\nSo, there are 4060 different ways to pick three balls from the box.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to pick three balls of the same color. There are three colors to consider: red, blue, and green.\n\nLet's start with red. There are 10 red balls. The number of ways to choose three red balls is C(10, 3):\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10 - 3)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to pick three red balls.\n\nNext, blue balls. There are 8 blue balls, so the number of ways to choose three blue balls is C(8, 3):\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8 - 3)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 56.\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to pick three blue balls.\n\nFinally, green balls. There are 12 green balls, so the number of ways to choose three green balls is C(12, 3):\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12 - 3)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 220.\n\nSo, there are 220 ways to pick three green balls.\n\nNow, to find the total number of favorable outcomes, I need to add up the number of ways to pick three balls of each color:\n\nTotal favorable outcomes = 120 (red) + 56 (blue) + 220 (green) = 396.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all three balls are the same color is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 396 / 4060.\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4:\n\n396 \u00f7 4 = 99\n\n4060 \u00f7 4 = 1015\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 99/1015.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal by dividing 99 by 1015, which is approximately 0.0975, or 9.75%.\n\nSo, the probability is 99/1015 or approximately 9.75%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to pick three balls from 30:\n\nC(30, 3) = (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 4060. That seems correct.\n\nThen, for red balls: C(10, 3) = 120.\n\nBlue balls: C(8, 3) = 56.\n\nGreen balls: C(12, 3) = 220.\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 120 + 56 + 220 = 396.\n\nProbability: 396 / 4060 = 99/1015 \u2248 0.0975 or 9.75%. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the probability step by step, considering the probability of picking three balls of the same color in sequence, without replacement.\n\nFor red balls:\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is 10/30.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of picking another red ball is 9/29.\n\nThen, the probability of picking a third red ball is 8/28.\n\nSo, the probability of picking three red balls in a row is (10/30) \u00d7 (9/29) \u00d7 (8/28).\n\nSimilarly, for blue balls:\n\nFirst blue ball: 8/30\n\nSecond blue ball: 7/29\n\nThird blue ball: 6/28\n\nFor green balls:\n\nFirst green ball: 12/30\n\nSecond green ball: 11/29\n\nThird green ball: 10/28\n\nThen, the total probability is the sum of these three probabilities.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFor red:\n\n(10/30) \u00d7 (9/29) \u00d7 (8/28) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28) = 720 / 24360 = 720 \u00f7 24 = 30, 24360 \u00f7 24 = 1015, so 30/1015.\n\nWait, that's not simplifying correctly. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 = 720\n\n30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28 = 30 \u00d7 29 = 870, 870 \u00d7 28 = 24360\n\nSo, 720 / 24360 = 720 \u00f7 120 = 6, 24360 \u00f7 120 = 203, so 6/203.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 120 for C(10, 3), and C(30, 3) is 4060, and 120 / 4060 = 120 \u00f7 20 = 6, 4060 \u00f7 20 = 203, so 6/203.\n\nWait, but earlier I added up to 396 / 4060 = 99 / 1015.\n\nWait, maybe I need to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nIn the combination approach, I got 396 / 4060 = 99 / 1015.\n\nIn the sequential probability approach, for red balls, I'm getting 6 / 203.\n\nSimilarly, for blue balls:\n\n(8/30) \u00d7 (7/29) \u00d7 (6/28) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28) = 336 / 24360 = 336 \u00f7 168 = 2, 24360 \u00f7 168 = 145, so 2 / 145.\n\nWait, but earlier, using combinations, C(8, 3) = 56, and 56 / 4060 = 56 \u00f7 4 = 14, 4060 \u00f7 4 = 1015, so 14 / 1015.\n\nWait, 14 / 1015 simplifies to 2 / 145, which matches the sequential approach.\n\nSimilarly, for green balls:\n\n(12/30) \u00d7 (11/29) \u00d7 (10/28) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28) = 1320 / 24360 = 1320 \u00f7 120 = 11, 24360 \u00f7 120 = 203, so 11 / 203.\n\nUsing combinations: C(12, 3) = 220, and 220 / 4060 = 220 \u00f7 20 = 11, 4060 \u00f7 20 = 203, so 11 / 203.\n\nSo, total probability is:\n\n(6 / 203) + (2 / 145) + (11 / 203)\n\nWait, but 203 and 145 are different denominators. Let me find a common denominator.\n\nFirst, note that 203 = 7 \u00d7 29, and 145 = 5 \u00d7 29, so the least common multiple is 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 29 = 1015.\n\nSo, converting each fraction:\n\n6 / 203 = (6 \u00d7 5) / (203 \u00d7 5) = 30 / 1015\n\n2 / 145 = (2 \u00d7 7) / (145 \u00d7 7) = 14 / 1015\n\n11 / 203 = (11 \u00d7 5) / (203 \u00d7 5) = 55 / 1015\n\nAdding them up: 30 + 14 + 55 = 99\n\nSo, total probability is 99 / 1015, which matches the combination approach.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 99/1015 or approximately 9.75%.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 99/1015.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{99}{1015}} \\]"
