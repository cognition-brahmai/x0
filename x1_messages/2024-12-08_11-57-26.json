        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a factory that produces widgets in batches of 1000, and in each batch, there are 10 defective widgets. So, if I randomly select one widget from a batch, I want to find the probability that it's not defective.\n\nWell, total widgets in a batch are 1000, and defective ones are 10. So, the number of non-defective widgets would be 1000 - 10 = 990.\n\nProbability of selecting a non-defective widget first is the number of non-defective widgets divided by the total number of widgets. So, that's 990 / 1000, which simplifies to 0.99 or 99%.\n\nNow, the second part: after picking the first widget and not replacing it, I pick another widget and want to find the probability that this second widget is also not defective.\n\nSince I didn't replace the first widget, the total number of widgets left in the batch is now 999. If the first widget I picked was non-defective, then the number of non-defective widgets left is 989.\n\nSo, the probability that the second widget is also not defective, given that the first one was not defective and not replaced, is 989 / 999.\n\nLet me calculate that. 989 divided by 999 is approximately 0.99, or still 99%.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the probability slightly decreases because I'm removing one non-defective widget without replacement. So, the probability should be slightly less than 99%.\n\nLet me compute it more precisely. 989 divided by 999 equals approximately 0.990, which is still 99%, but technically it's slightly less than the first probability.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the dependency here, I can think of it in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that both widgets are non-defective, picking without replacement, is the probability that the first one is non-defective multiplied by the probability that the second one is non-defective given that the first one was non-defective.\n\nSo, P(both non-defective) = P(first non-defective) * P(second non-defective | first non-defective)\n\nWe already have P(first non-defective) = 990 / 1000 = 0.99\n\nAnd P(second non-defective | first non-defective) = 989 / 999 \u2248 0.990\n\nSo, P(both non-defective) = 0.99 * 0.990 \u2248 0.9801, or 98.01%\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the probability that the second widget is not defective after the first one has been picked and not replaced, assuming the first one was not defective.\n\nSo, technically, it's asking for P(second non-defective | first non-defective), which is 989 / 999 \u2248 0.990\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider the overall process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use combinations to calculate this probability.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 widgets out of 1000 is C(1000, 2), which is (1000 * 999)/2 = 499,500\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 non-defective widgets is C(990, 2), which is (990 * 989)/2 = 489,055\n\nSo, the probability that both widgets are non-defective is 489,055 / 499,500 \u2248 0.979, or 97.9%\n\nBut earlier I got 98.01% using the other method. There's a slight discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the methods. Let me clarify.\n\nThe first method was for the probability of both widgets being non-defective when picked sequentially without replacement, which is P(first non-defective) * P(second non-defective | first non-defective) = (990/1000) * (989/999)\n\nCalculating that: 990/1000 = 0.990, and 989/999 \u2248 0.990, so 0.990 * 0.990 = 0.9801, or 98.01%\n\nThe second method using combinations: C(990,2)/C(1000,2) = (990*989/2) / (1000*999/2) = (990*989)/(1000*999)\n\nSimplifying: (990/1000)*(989/999), which is the same as the first method.\n\nSo, it should be 990/1000 * 989/999, which is approximately 0.9801, or 98.01%\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated it as 989/999 \u2248 0.990, which is correct, and 990/1000 = 0.990, so 0.990 * 0.990 = 0.9801\n\nBut if I compute 989/999 more precisely, it's about 0.990, but let's calculate it accurately: 989 divided by 999 is approximately 0.98998998999, which is very close to 0.990\n\nSo, multiplying 0.990 * 0.98998998999 gives approximately 0.9801, which is what I got.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both widgets are non-defective is approximately 98.01%\n\nBut the question has two parts:\n\n1. Probability that the first widget is not defective.\n\n2. Probability that the second widget is also not defective, given that the first one was not defective and not replaced.\n\nSo, for the first part, it's 990/1000 = 0.99 or 99%\n\nFor the second part, it's 989/999 \u2248 0.98999 or approximately 99%\n\nBut to be more precise, it's better to say that the probability is approximately 98.01% that both widgets are non-defective when picking two without replacement.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the dependency, perhaps I should use the conditional probability formula.\n\nLet me recall: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\n\nHere, A is the first widget being non-defective, and B is the second widget being non-defective given that the first one was non-defective.\n\nSo, P(A) = 990/1000 = 0.990\n\nP(B|A) = 989/999 \u2248 0.98999\n\nTherefore, P(A and B) = 0.990 * 0.98999 \u2248 0.9801, or 98.01%\n\nSo, the probability that both widgets are non-defective is approximately 98.01%\n\nBut the question seems to ask for two separate probabilities:\n\n1. Probability that the first widget is not defective.\n\n2. Probability that the second widget is not defective, given that the first one was not defective and not replaced.\n\nSo, the first probability is 990/1000 = 99%\n\nThe second probability is 989/999 \u2248 99%\n\nBut if you multiply these two probabilities, you get the probability that both are non-defective, which is approximately 98.01%\n\nI think the question is asking for both of these probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the probability that both are non-defective in sequence.\n\nWait, let's look back at the question:\n\n\" If you randomly select one widget from a batch, what is the probability that it is not defective? If you then pick another widget without replacing the first one, what is the probability that this second widget is also not defective? \"\n\nSo, it's asking for two things:\n\n1. Probability that the first widget is not defective.\n\n2. Probability that the second widget is also not defective, given that the first one was not defective and not replaced.\n\nSo, I need to provide both probabilities.\n\nFirst probability: P(first non-defective) = 990/1000 = 99%\n\nSecond probability: P(second non-defective | first non-defective) = 989/999 \u2248 99%\n\nAnd if I want to find the probability that both are non-defective, it's P(first non-defective) * P(second non-defective | first non-defective) = 99% * 989/999 \u2248 99% * 99% = 98.01%\n\nBut to answer the question directly, I need to provide the two probabilities as asked.\n\nSo, the probability that the first widget is not defective is 990/1000 = 99%\n\nAnd the probability that the second widget is also not defective, given that the first one was not defective and not replaced, is 989/999 \u2248 99%\n\nAlternatively, to be more precise, 989 divided by 999 is approximately 0.98998998999, which is about 98.999%\n\nBut for practical purposes, we can say it's approximately 99%\n\nSo, both probabilities are approximately 99%, but the second one is slightly less due to the reduction in the total number of widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should leave the answers in fractional form.\n\nSo, first probability: 990/1000 = 99/100 = 0.99 or 99%\n\nSecond probability: 989/999 \u2248 0.98998998999, which is approximately 99%\n\nBut to be exact, 989/999 is approximately 0.98998998999, which is about 98.999%\n\nSo, it's very close to 99%, but technically slightly less.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first widget is not defective is 99%, and the probability that the second widget is also not defective, given that the first one was not defective and not replaced, is approximately 98.999%, which can be rounded to 99%.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects the exact fractions to be provided.\n\nSo, first probability: 990/1000 = 99/100\n\nSecond probability: 989/999\n\nAlternatively, if it wants decimal or percentage form, then as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should provide the combined probability that both are non-defective.\n\nBut the question is asking for two separate probabilities:\n\n1. Probability that the first widget is not defective.\n\n2. Probability that the second widget is also not defective, given that the first one was not defective and not replaced.\n\nSo, I should provide both probabilities separately.\n\nTherefore:\n\n1. P(first non-defective) = 990 / 1000 = 99/100 = 0.99 or 99%\n\n2. P(second non-defective | first non-defective) = 989 / 999 \u2248 0.98998998999 or approximately 99%\n\nSo, both probabilities are approximately 99%, with the second one being slightly less due to the reduction in the total number of widgets after the first pick.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it more precisely, I can leave it as 990/1000 and 989/999.\n\nBut in percentage terms, both are approximately 99%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.99 \\text{ and } \\frac{989}{999}} \\]"
