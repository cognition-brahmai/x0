        "content": "Let's see. The man gives his son 15 cents on Monday. So, that's 15 cents.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, he doubles that amount. Double of 15 cents is 30 cents.\n\nOn Wednesday, he triples the original amount. The original amount was 15 cents, so triple of that is 45 cents.\n\nNow, to find the total amount the son received, we need to add up what he got on each day.\n\nSo, Monday: 15 cents, Tuesday: 30 cents, Wednesday: 45 cents.\n\nLet's add them up: 15 + 30 + 45.\n\n15 + 30 is 45, and 45 + 45 is 90.\n\nSo, the son received a total of 90 cents.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nOn Monday, it's 15 cents.\n\nOn Tuesday, it's double the Monday amount, which is 30 cents.\n\nOn Wednesday, it's triple the original amount, which is still 15 cents, so triple is 45 cents.\n\nAdding them up: 15 + 30 + 45 equals 90 cents.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to interpret \"triples the original amount.\" Maybe the original amount includes what he gave on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nWait, no. The problem says he triples the original amount on Wednesday. The original amount is what he gave on Monday, which is 15 cents.\n\nSo, triple of 15 cents is 45 cents on Wednesday.\n\nSo, the total is still 15 + 30 + 45 = 90 cents.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
