        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 50 acres of land, and he allocates 60% of it for corn. So, first I need to find out how many acres are allocated for corn and how many for wheat.\n\nTo find the acres allocated for corn, I can calculate 60% of 50 acres.\n\nAcres for corn = 60% of 50 = 0.60 * 50 = 30 acres.\n\nSince the rest of the land is allocated for wheat, the acres for wheat would be:\n\nAcres for wheat = Total acres - Acres for corn = 50 - 30 = 20 acres.\n\nNow, each acre of corn yields 120 bushels, so the total yield for corn would be:\n\nCorn yield = Acres for corn * Yield per acre = 30 * 120 = 3600 bushels.\n\nSimilarly, each acre of wheat yields 80 bushels, so the total yield for wheat would be:\n\nWheat yield = Acres for wheat * Yield per acre = 20 * 80 = 1600 bushels.\n\nTo find the total yield from both crops, I need to add the corn yield and the wheat yield together:\n\nTotal yield = Corn yield + Wheat yield = 3600 + 1600 = 5200 bushels.\n\nSo, the total yield in bushels from both crops is 5200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5200} \\]"
