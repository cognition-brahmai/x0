        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If a car uses 5 liters of fuel to travel 100 kilometers, how much fuel will it use to travel 750 kilometers? And I need to show my reasoning. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between fuel consumption and distance. The problem says the car uses 5 liters to travel 100 kilometers. That sounds like a fuel efficiency rate, right? So, it's consuming 5 liters per 100 kilometers.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much fuel it would use for 750 kilometers. Since 750 kilometers is a multiple of 100 kilometers, I can probably use proportions here.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the fuel consumption rate per kilometer.\n\nIf 5 liters are used for 100 kilometers, then the fuel consumption per kilometer would be:\n\n5 liters / 100 kilometers = 0.05 liters per kilometer.\n\nOkay, so the car uses 0.05 liters of fuel for every kilometer it travels.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the fuel used for 750 kilometers.\n\nNow, if the car uses 0.05 liters per kilometer, then for 750 kilometers, the total fuel used would be:\n\n0.05 liters/kilometer * 750 kilometers = 37.5 liters.\n\nSo, the car would use 37.5 liters of fuel to travel 750 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe without finding the per kilometer consumption?\n\nLet me try another method.\n\nAlternative Method:\n\nSince 100 kilometers require 5 liters, then for 750 kilometers, I can find out how many sets of 100 kilometers are there in 750 kilometers.\n\n750 kilometers / 100 kilometers = 7.5.\n\nSo, there are 7.5 sets of 100 kilometers in 750 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the fuel required would be 7.5 * 5 liters = 37.5 liters.\n\nOkay, that matches the first method's result.\n\nAnother way could be to use a proportion.\n\nSetting up a proportion:\n\n5 liters / 100 kilometers = x liters / 750 kilometers.\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying: 5 * 750 = 100 * x.\n\nSo, 3750 = 100x.\n\nTherefore, x = 3750 / 100 = 37.5 liters.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which method I use, I end up with 37.5 liters.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect fuel consumption, like perhaps acceleration or terrain, but the problem doesn't mention any variables like that. It's a straightforward fuel consumption rate problem, so I think 37.5 liters is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst method:\n\n5 liters / 100 km = 0.05 liters/km.\n\n0.05 liters/km * 750 km = 37.5 liters.\n\nSecond method:\n\n750 km / 100 km = 7.5.\n\n7.5 * 5 liters = 37.5 liters.\n\nThird method:\n\nProportion: 5/100 = x/750.\n\nCross-multiply: 5*750 = 100*x \u2192 3750 = 100x \u2192 x = 37.5 liters.\n\nAll methods confirm the same result.\n\nTherefore, the car will use 37.5 liters of fuel to travel 750 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.5} \\]"
