        "content": "So I've got this function f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - z), and I need to find its residues at the poles. Alright, let's start by understanding what residues are and how to calculate them.\n\nFirst off, residues are related to complex functions and their singularities, specifically poles. A pole is a type of singularity where the function blows up to infinity. The residue at a pole is a coefficient that appears in the Laurent series expansion of the function around that pole, and it's particularly important in complex analysis, especially when evaluating contour integrals.\n\nSo, to find the residues of f(z), I need to:\n\n1. Identify the poles of f(z).\n\n2. Determine the order of each pole.\n\n3. Calculate the residue at each pole.\n\nLet's tackle this step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the poles of f(z).**\n\nThe poles are the points where the denominator is zero, since that's where the function becomes infinite. So, I need to solve for z in the equation:\n\nz^3 - z = 0\n\nFactoring the denominator:\n\nz(z^2 - 1) = 0\n\nz(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nSo, the poles are at z = 0, z = 1, and z = -1.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the order of each pole.**\n\nThe order of a pole is the multiplicity of the root in the denominator. In this case, each factor (z), (z - 1), and (z + 1) is linear, meaning each pole is of order 1, also known as simple poles.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the order by seeing how many times I need to differentiate the denominator to get a non-zero value at the pole.\n\nFor z = 0:\n\nDenominator: z^3 - z = z(z^2 - 1)\n\nFirst derivative: 3z^2 - 1\n\nAt z = 0: 3(0)^2 - 1 = -1 \u2260 0, so order 1.\n\nSimilarly for z = 1:\n\nDenominator: z^3 - z\n\nFirst derivative: 3z^2 - 1\n\nAt z = 1: 3(1)^2 - 1 = 2 \u2260 0, so order 1.\n\nAnd for z = -1:\n\nDenominator: z^3 - z\n\nFirst derivative: 3z^2 - 1\n\nAt z = -1: 3(-1)^2 - 1 = 2 \u2260 0, so order 1.\n\nGreat, all poles are simple poles.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the residue at each pole.**\n\nFor simple poles, there's a straightforward formula to compute the residue. If f(z) = g(z)/h(z), where g and h are analytic at the pole, and h has a simple zero there, then the residue of f at z = a is:\n\nRes[f(z), z = a] = g(a)/h'(a)\n\nIn our case, f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - z), so g(z) = z^2 + 1 and h(z) = z^3 - z.\n\nWe already have h'(z) = 3z^2 - 1.\n\nSo, for each pole:\n\n- At z = 0:\n\ng(0) = 0^2 + 1 = 1\n\nh'(0) = 3(0)^2 - 1 = -1\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = 1 / (-1) = -1\n\n- At z = 1:\n\ng(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 2\n\nh'(1) = 3(1)^2 - 1 = 2\n\nRes[f(z), z = 1] = 2 / 2 = 1\n\n- At z = -1:\n\ng(-1) = (-1)^2 + 1 = 2\n\nh'(-1) = 3(-1)^2 - 1 = 2\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nSo, the residues are:\n\nAt z = 0: -1\n\nAt z = 1: 1\n\nAt z = -1: 1\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, confirming the poles: z = 0, z = 1, z = -1. That's correct.\n\nOrder of poles: each is order 1, as shown. That seems right.\n\nNow, residue calculations:\n\nAt z = 0:\n\ng(0) = 1\n\nh'(0) = -1\n\nRes = 1 / (-1) = -1. Okay.\n\nAt z = 1:\n\ng(1) = 2\n\nh'(1) = 2\n\nRes = 2 / 2 = 1. Okay.\n\nAt z = -1:\n\ng(-1) = 2\n\nh'(-1) = 2\n\nRes = 2 / 2 = 1. Okay.\n\nHmm, but I recall that the sum of residues of a function in the complex plane is zero, provided the function behaves well at infinity. Let's check that here.\n\nSum of residues: -1 + 1 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, that's not zero. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the residue at infinity as well. The residue at infinity is given by:\n\nRes[f(z), \u221e] = -Res(1/f(1/z), z = 0)\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the partial fraction decomposition of f(z) to verify the residues.\n\nLet's try partial fractions.\n\nGiven f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z(z - 1)(z + 1))\n\nLet's write this as:\n\nf(z) = A/z + B/(z - 1) + C/(z + 1)\n\nThen,\n\nz^2 + 1 = A(z - 1)(z + 1) + B(z)(z + 1) + C(z)(z - 1)\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\nA(z^2 - 1) + B(z^2 + z) + C(z^2 - z)\n\n= A z^2 - A + B z^2 + B z + C z^2 - C z\n\n= (A + B + C) z^2 + (B - C) z - A\n\nNow, equate coefficients with the left-hand side:\n\nz^2: 1 = A + B + C\n\nz: 0 = B - C\n\nConstant: 1 = -A\n\nFrom the constant term: -A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1\n\nFrom z term: 0 = B - C \u21d2 B = C\n\nFrom z^2 term: 1 = A + B + C = -1 + B + C = -1 + 2B (since B = C)\n\nSo,\n\n1 = -1 + 2B \u21d2 2 = 2B \u21d2 B = 1\n\nThen, C = B = 1\n\nTherefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\nf(z) = -1/z + 1/(z - 1) + 1/(z + 1)\n\nNow, the residues are exactly the coefficients in the partial fractions:\n\nAt z = 0: -1\n\nAt z = 1: 1\n\nAt z = -1: 1\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut again, the sum is -1 + 1 + 1 = 1, which is not zero. Maybe the sum of residues is only zero if the function is analytic at infinity, which in this case, it's not, since the degree of the denominator is higher than the degree of the numerator by 1, not by at least 2.\n\nWait, no. For the sum of residues to be zero, the function should satisfy certain conditions at infinity. In this case, since the degree of the denominator is one more than the numerator, the integral over a large circle tends to zero, and the sum of residues equals zero.\n\nBut in this case, the sum is 1, which is not zero. Maybe I'm missing a residue at infinity.\n\nLet's calculate the residue at infinity.\n\nRes[f(z), \u221e] = -Res(1/f(1/z), z = 0)\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, for a function f(z), the sum of residues in the finite plane plus the residue at infinity equals zero.\n\nSo, sum of residues = 0\n\nTherefore, Res[0] + Res[1] + Res[-1] + Res[\u221e] = 0\n\nWe have Res[0] + Res[1] + Res[-1] = 1\n\nTherefore, Res[\u221e] = -1\n\nThat makes sense. So the sum is zero.\n\nBut since the problem only asks for residues at the poles, and these are at z = 0, z = 1, z = -1, I can leave it at that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my partial fraction decomposition.\n\nWait, let's double-check the partial fractions.\n\nWe have:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z(z - 1)(z + 1))\n\nAssume:\n\nA/z + B/(z - 1) + C/(z + 1) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - z)\n\nMultiply both sides by z(z - 1)(z + 1):\n\nA(z - 1)(z + 1) + B z (z + 1) + C z (z - 1) = z^2 + 1\n\nExpand:\n\nA(z^2 - 1) + B(z^2 + z) + C(z^2 - z) = z^2 + 1\n\nCollect like terms:\n\n(A + B + C) z^2 + (B - C) z + (-A) = z^2 + 0 z + 1\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nz^2: A + B + C = 1\n\nz: B - C = 0 \u21d2 B = C\n\nConstant: -A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1\n\nSubstitute A = -1 into the first equation:\n\n-1 + B + C = 1 \u21d2 B + C = 2\n\nBut since B = C, then 2B = 2 \u21d2 B = 1, C = 1\n\nSo, A = -1, B = 1, C = 1\n\nThus, f(z) = -1/z + 1/(z - 1) + 1/(z + 1)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the residues are:\n\nAt z = 0: -1\n\nAt z = 1: 1\n\nAt z = -1: 1\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Residues: at } z = 0: -1, \\, z = 1: 1, \\, z = -1: 1} \\]"
