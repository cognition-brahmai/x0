        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the company produces 100 units of product X in one hour. They operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and we need to find out how many units they produce in a non-leap year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many hours there are in a day, a week, and then a year. Since they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and it's a non-leap year, which has 365 days.\n\nSo, let's start by calculating the total number of hours in a year.\n\nTotal hours in a year = Hours per day \u00d7 Days per week \u00d7 Weeks per year\n\nWait, but actually, it's better to calculate it as:\n\nTotal hours in a year = Hours per day \u00d7 Days per year\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day and 365 days in a non-leap year.\n\nSo, Total hours in a year = 24 hours/day \u00d7 365 days/year\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n24 \u00d7 365\n\nI know that 24 \u00d7 365 is 8,760 hours in a year.\n\nNow, since the company produces 100 units per hour, the total production in a year would be:\n\nTotal units = Units per hour \u00d7 Total hours in a year\n\nSo, Total units = 100 units/hour \u00d7 8,760 hours/year\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n100 \u00d7 8,760 = 876,000 units per year.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should double-check if there's any other factor to consider. The problem says they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so no days off, which means they work every day of the year.\n\nAlso, it's specified that it's a non-leap year, so 365 days, which is correct.\n\nSo, the total production should indeed be 100 units per hour times 8,760 hours in a year, which equals 876,000 units.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any downtime or maintenance periods, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I assume they operate continuously.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the production per day first, then multiply by the number of days in a year.\n\nSo, units per day = units per hour \u00d7 hours per day\n\nUnits per day = 100 \u00d7 24 = 2,400 units per day\n\nThen, total units per year = units per day \u00d7 days per year\n\nTotal units per year = 2,400 \u00d7 365\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n2,400 \u00d7 365\n\nI can break it down:\n\n2,400 \u00d7 300 = 720,000\n\n2,400 \u00d7 60 = 144,000\n\n2,400 \u00d7 5 = 12,000\n\nNow, add them up: 720,000 + 144,000 + 12,000 = 876,000 units per year\n\nSame result as before, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the production per week first, then multiply by the number of weeks in a year.\n\nUnits per week = units per day \u00d7 days per week\n\nUnits per week = 2,400 \u00d7 7 = 16,800 units per week\n\nNow, number of weeks in a year is 52 weeks, but that's approximately 364 days, since 52 \u00d7 7 = 364. But a non-leap year has 365 days, so there's one extra day.\n\nSo, total units per year = units per week \u00d7 52 + units per day \u00d7 1\n\n= 16,800 \u00d7 52 + 2,400 \u00d7 1\n\nCalculate 16,800 \u00d7 50 = 840,000\n\n16,800 \u00d7 2 = 33,600\n\nSo, 840,000 + 33,600 = 873,600\n\nThen add the extra day's production: 873,600 + 2,400 = 876,000 units per year\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis consistency gives me confidence that 876,000 units per year is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother method could be to calculate the annual production directly using the hourly production rate and total annual hours.\n\nWe already did that earlier and arrived at 8,760 hours in a year, multiplied by 100 units per hour, giving 876,000 units.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the production in terms of minutes or seconds, but that seems unnecessarily complicated since the given rate is per hour and the operation is continuous on an hourly basis.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the company produces 876,000 units of product X in a non-leap year, operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{876000} \\]"
