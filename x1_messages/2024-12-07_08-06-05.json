        "content": "So the airline company is looking to boost its passenger capacity between two big cities without adding more flights. They currently have 15 flights a day, each averaging 200 passengers, and they want to increase that capacity by 25%. They're considering changing the types of planes they use to accommodate more people per flight.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what their current daily passenger capacity is. If they have 15 flights per day, each with 200 passengers, that's:\n\n15 flights/day * 200 passengers/flight = 3,000 passengers/day\n\nThey want to increase that by 25%. So, 25% of 3,000 is:\n\n0.25 * 3,000 = 750 passengers\n\nTherefore, their target daily passenger capacity is:\n\n3,000 + 750 = 3,750 passengers/day\n\nNow, they don't want to add more flights, so they're still stuck with 15 flights per day. To find out the required capacity per flight to meet the new target, I'll divide the total desired passengers by the number of flights:\n\n3,750 passengers/day \u00f7 15 flights/day = 250 passengers/flight\n\nSo, they need each flight to carry an average of 250 passengers to reach their goal.\n\nNext, they have options for different aircraft sizes: small (150 passengers), medium (250 passengers), or large (350 passengers). Since they need 250 passengers per flight, the medium-sized aircraft seems perfect for their needs.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. For example, perhaps there are constraints based on airport facilities, such as maximum aircraft size that can land or take off from the airports in question. Or maybe there are regulatory limits on the number of passengers per flight. Also, the availability of medium-sized aircraft in their fleet or the cost of acquiring new aircraft could be factors.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, it seems that switching to medium-sized aircraft with a capacity of 250 passengers would allow them to achieve their goal of increasing daily passenger capacity by 25% without adding more flights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
