        "content": "Stokes' theorem relates a surface integral over a surface to a line integral around its boundary. The theorem states that \u222e(F \u00b7 dr) = \u222c(curl F \u00b7 dS), where curl F is the curl of the vector field F, and dS is the differential area vector of the surface.\n\nGiven F = (y^2, -xz, z^3), and the curve C defined by r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t) for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 2\u03c0, we need to evaluate the line integral \u222e(F \u00b7 dr).\n\nFirst, let's find the curl of F.\n\ncurl F = (\u2202Fz/\u2202y - \u2202Fy/\u2202z, \u2202Fx/\u2202z - \u2202Fz/\u2202x, \u2202Fy/\u2202x - \u2202Fx/\u2202y)\n\nSo, curl F = (\u2202(z^3)/\u2202y - \u2202(-xz)/\u2202z, \u2202(y^2)/\u2202z - \u2202(z^3)/\u2202x, \u2202(-xz)/\u2202x - \u2202(y^2)/\u2202y)\n\nCalculating each component:\n\n\u2202(z^3)/\u2202y = 0\n\n\u2202(-xz)/\u2202z = -x\n\nSo, first component: 0 - (-x) = x\n\n\u2202(y^2)/\u2202z = 0\n\n\u2202(z^3)/\u2202x = 0\n\nSo, second component: 0 - 0 = 0\n\n\u2202(-xz)/\u2202x = -z\n\n\u2202(y^2)/\u2202y = 2y\n\nSo, third component: -z - 2y\n\nTherefore, curl F = (x, 0, -z - 2y)\n\nNow, we need to choose a surface S whose boundary is the curve C. Since C is defined by r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t), which is a helix, we can choose the surface S to be the portion of the cylinder x^2 + y^2 = 1 bounded by z = 0 and z = 2\u03c0.\n\nHowever, parameterizing this surface might be complicated, so let's consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can directly compute the line integral \u222e(F \u00b7 dr).\n\nGiven r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t), then dr/dt = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1)\n\nSo, dr = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1) dt\n\nNow, F(r(t)) = (sin^2(t), -cos(t)*t, t^3)\n\nTherefore, F \u00b7 dr = (sin^2(t))(-sin(t)) + (-cos(t)*t)(cos(t)) + (t^3)(1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -sin^3(t) - t cos^2(t) + t^3\n\nNow, the line integral is \u222b from 0 to 2\u03c0 of (-sin^3(t) - t cos^2(t) + t^3) dt\n\nThis seems complicated, so maybe using Stokes' theorem is a better approach.\n\nLet's proceed with Stokes' theorem: \u222e(F \u00b7 dr) = \u222c(curl F \u00b7 dS)\n\nWe have curl F = (x, 0, -z - 2y)\n\nWe need to choose a surface S with boundary C. Since C is a helix, one possible surface is the cylinder x^2 + y^2 = 1 with z from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S by r(s, t) = (cos(s), sin(s), t), where s \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], t \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]\n\nThen, the partial derivatives are:\n\nr_s = (-sin(s), cos(s), 0)\n\nr_t = (0, 0, 1)\n\nSo, the differential area vector dS = r_s \u00d7 r_t = (cos(s), sin(s), 0) ds dt\n\nTherefore, curl F \u00b7 dS = (x, 0, -z - 2y) \u00b7 (cos(s), sin(s), 0) ds dt\n\nBut x = cos(s), y = sin(s), z = t\n\nSo, curl F \u00b7 dS = (cos(s), 0, -t - 2 sin(s)) \u00b7 (cos(s), sin(s), 0) ds dt\n\n= cos^2(s) + 0 + 0 ds dt\n\n= cos^2(s) ds dt\n\nNow, the surface integral is \u222c cos^2(s) ds dt, with s from 0 to 2\u03c0 and t from 0 to 2\u03c0\n\nSo, \u222c cos^2(s) ds dt = \u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) \u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) cos^2(s) ds dt\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to s:\n\n\u222b cos^2(s) ds = (1/2)(s + sin(s) cos(s)) + C\n\nFrom 0 to 2\u03c0: (1/2)(2\u03c0 + 0) - (1/2)(0 + 0) = \u03c0\n\nNow, integrate with respect to t from 0 to 2\u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 * (2\u03c0 - 0) = 2\u03c0^2\n\nTherefore, the line integral \u222e(F \u00b7 dr) = 2\u03c0^2\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2\\pi^2} \\]"
