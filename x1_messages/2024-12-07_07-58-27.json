]s.\n\nBut it's hard, it is. Every day, it's getting harder. The ring's power is growing, and so is my desire for it. I can't let go, I just can't. It's like trying to give up the air I breathe.\n\nMaybe I should keep it, keep it hidden, and find a way to use its power for good. Yes, that's it. Use it to help Frodo and the others, to protect them from harm. But how? I don't know yet, but I'll think of something. I always do.\n\nBut deep down, I know it's dangerous. The ring corrupts, even the best of intentions. But I'm not like them, I'm different. I can handle it, I know I can.\n\nSo, for now, I'll keep it hidden, play along with Frodo and Sam, and wait for the right moment. Yes, that's the plan. Wait and see, and when the time is right, strike! Take back what's mine, my precious ring.\n\nBut until then, I have to be patient, bide my time. It's not easy, but I can do it. I have to do it, for the ring, for myself.\n\nMy precious, wait for me, I'm coming."
