        "content": "Let's see. I need to find the sum of all integers between -50 and 50. So, that means I'm including all the negative numbers from -50 up to -1, zero, and then all the positive numbers from 1 to 50.\n\nFirst, I know that the sum of a range of integers can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm dealing with negative and positive numbers, maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me think about it. If I list out the integers between -50 and 50, it would look like: -50, -49, -48, ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., 48, 49, 50.\n\nI notice that for every negative number, there's a corresponding positive number. For example, -50 and 50, -49 and 49, and so on, up to -1 and 1.\n\nSo, if I pair them up, each pair would be: (-50 + 50) = 0, (-49 + 49) = 0, ..., (-1 + 1) = 0, and then there's the zero in the middle.\n\nSo, all these pairs sum to zero, and adding zero doesn't change the sum.\n\nTherefore, the total sum should be zero.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Is there any integer in this range that doesn't have a counterpart?\n\nLooking at the list: -50 to 50 includes both -50 and 50, and zero is included.\n\nEach negative number has a positive counterpart, and their sum is zero.\n\nSo, yes, the total sum should be zero.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the properties of addition. Addition is commutative, meaning the order in which numbers are added doesn't affect the sum.\n\nSo, I can rearrange the numbers in any order without changing the sum.\n\nIf I pair each negative number with its positive counterpart, each pair sums to zero, and adding zero doesn't change anything.\n\nTherefore, the sum is zero.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the formula for the sum of the first n integers.\n\nI know that the sum of the first n positive integers is n(n+1)/2.\n\nSo, the sum from 1 to 50 would be 50*51/2 = 1275.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of the first n negative integers is -n(n+1)/2.\n\nSo, the sum from -1 to -50 would be -50*51/2 = -1275.\n\nThen, adding the sum of the positive integers and the sum of the negative integers, plus zero:\n\n1275 + (-1275) + 0 = 0.\n\nAgain, the total sum is zero.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the sum from -50 to 50 as the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is -50, the last term is 50, and the number of terms is 101 (since there are 50 negative numbers, 50 positive numbers, and zero).\n\nUsing the sum formula: sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term)/2.\n\nSo, sum = 101 * (-50 + 50)/2 = 101 * 0/2 = 0.\n\nAgain, the sum is zero.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting zero as the sum.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integers between -50 and 50 is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
