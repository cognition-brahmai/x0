        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in the class, and 60% of them passed the exam. I need to find out how many students failed the exam.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many students passed the exam. Since 60% passed, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 30.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 30, I can multiply 30 by 0.60.\n\n30 \u00d7 0.60 = 18\n\nSo, 18 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find out how many failed, I can subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students.\n\n30 - 18 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 students failed the exam.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of students who failed and then find that number.\n\nIf 60% passed, then 40% failed, because 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nSo, I can calculate 40% of 30 to find the number of students who failed.\n\n30 \u00d7 0.40 = 12\n\nAgain, I get 12 students failed the exam.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 12 students failed the exam.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Percentages can sometimes be tricky, but in this case, it's pretty simple.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's make sure that the percentages add up correctly.\n\nPassed: 60%\n\nFailed: 40%\n\nTotal: 60% + 40% = 100%\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlso, checking the numbers:\n\nPassed: 18 students\n\nFailed: 12 students\n\nTotal: 18 + 12 = 30 students\n\nThat matches the total number of students in the class.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 12 students failed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
