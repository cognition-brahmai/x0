The explosion occurred in one of the Service Module's oxygen tanks, which caused a series of catastrophic events that threatened the lives of the crew members. As a result, the mission objective to land on the Moon had to be abandoned, and the primary focus shifted to safely returning the astronauts back to Earth."
