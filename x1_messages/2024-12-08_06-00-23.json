        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says the rectangle has a length of 12 meters and a width of 5 meters. I need to find the area of the rectangle, and then find out what the new area would be if both the length and the width were doubled. Okay, let's start with the first part.\n\nI remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if the length is 12 meters and the width is 5 meters, the area should be 12 times 5. Let me do that multiplication: 12 \u00d7 5 equals 60. So, the area of the rectangle is 60 square meters.\n\nNow, the next part is to find the new area if both dimensions are doubled. Doubling the length means the new length would be 12 meters \u00d7 2, which is 24 meters. Similarly, doubling the width means the new width would be 5 meters \u00d7 2, which is 10 meters.\n\nSo, the new area would be the new length multiplied by the new width, which is 24 meters \u00d7 10 meters. Let's calculate that: 24 \u00d7 10 equals 240 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there a shorter way to do this without calculating the new dimensions separately? I recall that if you scale both dimensions of a rectangle by the same factor, the area is scaled by the square of that factor. In this case, since both dimensions are doubled, which is a scaling factor of 2, the area should be scaled by 2 squared, which is 4.\n\nSo, if the original area is 60 square meters, multiplying by 4 should give the new area: 60 \u00d7 4 equals 240 square meters. That matches what I calculated earlier by finding the new dimensions first.\n\nIt's good to see that both methods give the same result. This confirms that the new area is indeed 240 square meters.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Original area: 12 m \u00d7 5 m = 60 m\u00b2\n\n- New dimensions: length = 24 m, width = 10 m\n\n- New area: 24 m \u00d7 10 m = 240 m\u00b2\n\nAlternatively, using the scaling factor:\n\n- Scaling factor = 2\n\n- Area scaling factor = 2\u00b2 = 4\n\n- New area = original area \u00d7 4 = 60 m\u00b2 \u00d7 4 = 240 m\u00b2\n\nBoth approaches lead to the same conclusion. So, the area of the rectangle is 60 square meters, and if both dimensions are doubled, the new area would be 240 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the rectangle is \\boxed{60} square meters, and the new area after doubling both dimensions is \\boxed{240} square meters.\n"
