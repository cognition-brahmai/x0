As I soar through the skies above Metropolis, watching over our beloved city, I wanted to take a moment to express my unwavering commitment to protecting it and all its inhabitants, especially you.\n\nYou know me, Lois\u2014always ready to face any challenge that comes our way. Whether it's battling ruthless villains or standing up for truth and justice, I am here, now and forever. Metropolis is more than just a city to me; it's home, and its people are my family.\n\nI want you to feel safe, knowing that no matter what dangers may arise, I will be there to shield you and our city from harm. My powers are not just for show; they are a gift, one that I use to make sure that Metropolis thrives in peace and prosperity.\n\nBut protection isn't just about physical strength; it's also about being there for you emotionally, supporting you through thick and thin. You are my rock, Lois, and I am here for you in every way possible.\n\nSo, as I continue to patrol the heavens, keep your chin up and your spirit strong. Together, we can overcome any obstacle that dares to stand in our way.\n\nWith all my love and dedication,\n\nClark Kent\n(Superman)\n\nP.S. Don't forget to look up every now and then; I might just be passing by."
