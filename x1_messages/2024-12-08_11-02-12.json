        "content": "So I have this problem here: a spherical ball has a surface area of 314 square centimeters, and I need to find the radius of the ball in centimeters. Okay, let's start by recalling the formula for the surface area of a sphere. I think it's something like A equals 4 times pi times r squared, where A is the surface area and r is the radius. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nAnd I know that A is 314 square centimeters. So, I can plug that into the formula:\n\n314 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to solve for r. First, I should isolate r\u00b2. Maybe I can divide both sides of the equation by 4\u03c0 to get r\u00b2 by itself.\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = 314 / (4\u03c0)\n\nHmm, I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416. Should I use that value here? Or is there a way to keep it as \u03c0?\n\nWell, since 314 is a multiple of \u03c0, maybe it will cancel out nicely. Let me check:\n\n314 divided by \u03c0. If \u03c0 is approximately 3.14, then 314 divided by 3.14 is 100. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n314 \u00f7 3.14 = 100\n\nYes, exactly. So, 314 divided by \u03c0 is 100, because 3.14 times 100 is 314.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = 100 / 4\n\nBecause 314 / (4\u03c0) is the same as (314 / \u03c0) / 4, and 314 / \u03c0 is 100, so 100 / 4 is 25.\n\nTherefore, r\u00b2 = 25\n\nNow, to find r, I need to take the square root of both sides.\n\nr = \u221a25\n\nWhich is 5.\n\nSo, the radius of the ball is 5 centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again:\n\nA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nA = 314 cm\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n314 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by 4\u03c0:\n\nr\u00b2 = 314 / (4\u03c0)\n\nNow, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.14,\n\nr\u00b2 = 314 / (4 \u00d7 3.14)\n\nCalculate 4 \u00d7 3.14:\n\n4 \u00d7 3.14 = 12.56\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = 314 / 12.56\n\nNow, 314 divided by 12.56 is indeed 25.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = 25\n\nTherefore, r = \u221a25 = 5 cm\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it another way. The surface area of a sphere is also given by A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2. If I know A, I can solve for r.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the circumference or something, but I think surface area is the way to go here.\n\nWait, but actually, I think I've got it right. The radius is 5 centimeters.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for the volume, but that's not given, only the surface area.\n\nOr perhaps using the relationship between the surface area and the radius directly.\n\nBut I think the approach I took is standard and correct.\n\nSo, final answer: the radius is 5 centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
