        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with 150 cars. On Monday, they rent out 60% of them. First, I need to figure out how many cars that is.\n\nTo find 60% of 150, I can calculate:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 150 = 90 cars\n\nSo, they rented out 90 cars on Monday.\n\nNow, the question is about reaching an 80% rental rate for both Monday and Tuesday combined. So, over two days, they want to have rented out 80% of their 150 cars.\n\nFirst, let's find out what 80% of 150 is:\n\n0.80 \u00d7 150 = 120 cars\n\nSo, they want to have rented out a total of 120 cars over the two days.\n\nOn Monday, they already rented out 90 cars. So, to find out how many more cars they need to rent out on Tuesday to reach the total of 120 cars, I can subtract the number rented on Monday from the target total:\n\n120 - 90 = 30 cars\n\nTherefore, they need to rent out 30 more cars on Tuesday to reach an 80% rental rate for the two days combined.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider the total number of cars available over two days. But actually, the company has 150 cars each day, but I think the rental rate is based on the total cars available over the two days, not the total cars available each day.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's consider the total number of cars available over two days. Since they have 150 cars each day, the total number of cars available over two days would be:\n\n150 cars/day \u00d7 2 days = 300 car-days\n\nNow, they want to rent out 80% of these 300 car-days.\n\nSo, 0.80 \u00d7 300 = 240 car-days\n\nThis means they want to have rented out a total of 240 car-days over the two days.\n\nOn Monday, they rented out 90 cars, which is 90 car-days.\n\nSo, to find out how many car-days they need to rent out on Tuesday to reach the total of 240 car-days, I can subtract the Monday rentals from the target:\n\n240 - 90 = 150 car-days\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because they only have 150 cars available on Tuesday. So, renting out 150 cars on Tuesday would be 150 car-days.\n\nBut according to this calculation, they need to rent out 150 car-days on Tuesday to reach the total of 240 car-days.\n\nBut they only have 150 cars available, so renting out all of them on Tuesday would meet this requirement.\n\nBut earlier, I thought they needed to rent out only 30 more cars to reach 120 total rentals. But now, this approach suggests they need to rent out 150 cars on Tuesday.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, and I need to figure out which approach is correct.\n\nLet me think about what the rental rate means in this context. The question says \"an 80% rental rate for the two days combined.\"\n\nIf the company has 150 cars available each day, and they operate for two days, then the total number of car-days available is 300.\n\nRenting out 80% of 300 car-days would be 240 car-days.\n\nOn Monday, they rented out 90 cars, which is 90 car-days.\n\nSo, to reach 240 car-days, they need to rent out 150 car-days on Tuesday.\n\nBut they only have 150 cars, so renting out all of them on Tuesday would meet this requirement.\n\nAlternatively, if the company is considered to have the same 150 cars available each day, but cars rented on Monday are returned by Tuesday, then the total number of car-days is indeed 300.\n\nTherefore, to reach 240 car-days rented over two days, they need to rent out 150 cars on Tuesday, assuming they rent out different cars each day.\n\nBut perhaps the confusion comes from interpreting the \"rental rate for the two days combined.\"\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nMaybe the rental rate is based on the total number of cars rented over the two days divided by the total number of cars available over the two days.\n\nSo, rental rate = (total cars rented over two days) / (total cars available over two days)\n\nThey want this rental rate to be 80%.\n\nSo, (total rented) / 300 = 0.80\n\nTherefore, total rented = 0.80 \u00d7 300 = 240 car-days\n\nOn Monday, they rented 90 car-days.\n\nSo, needed on Tuesday: 240 - 90 = 150 car-days\n\nSince they have 150 cars available on Tuesday, renting out all of them would achieve exactly 150 car-days on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, they need to rent out all 150 cars on Tuesday to reach the combined 80% rental rate over the two days.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because on Monday they rented out 60% of the cars, which is 90 cars, and on Tuesday they would need to rent out 100% of the cars to reach an 80% rental rate over two days.\n\nWait, is that makes sense?\n\nLet me check with actual numbers.\n\nTotal car-days available: 150 cars \u00d7 2 days = 300 car-days\n\nDesired rental rate: 80%\n\nSo, desired total car-days rented: 0.80 \u00d7 300 = 240 car-days\n\nMonday rentals: 90 car-days\n\nTuesday rentals needed: 240 - 90 = 150 car-days\n\nSince they have 150 cars available on Tuesday, renting out all of them would give exactly 150 car-days.\n\nTherefore, they need to rent out all 150 cars on Tuesday to reach the desired rental rate.\n\nBut the initial approach suggested they only need to rent out 30 more cars to reach 120 total rentals, but that might be misunderstanding the rental rate calculation.\n\nI think the correct interpretation is based on car-days, considering the total availability over the two days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that they need to rent out all 150 cars on Tuesday to reach an 80% rental rate for the two days combined.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
