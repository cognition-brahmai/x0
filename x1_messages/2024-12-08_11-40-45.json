        "content": "So we have a group of friends going to a restaurant, and they have different dietary preferences. There are 4 vegetarians, 3 vegans, and 5 meat-eaters. Now, the question is, if someone is chosen at random, what's the probability that this person orders a vegetarian meal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is choosing a vegetarian, since we want to know the probability of picking someone who orders a vegetarian meal. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of people in the group, because anyone could be chosen.\n\nSo, let's figure out the total number of people. There are 4 vegetarians, 3 vegans, and 5 meat-eaters. Adding those up: 4 + 3 + 5 equals 12. So, there are 12 people in total.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of vegetarians, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the probability P that a randomly chosen person is a vegetarian is P = number of vegetarians / total number of people = 4 / 12.\n\nWe can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives us 1 / 3.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe I'm missing something. The question mentions that everyone orders a meal according to their dietary preference. Does that change anything?\n\nWell, since people are ordering according to their dietary preferences, the number of vegetarians is still 4, vegans 3, and meat-eaters 5. The ordering doesn't change the counts; it just confirms what their preferences are.\n\nSo, my initial calculation should still hold. The probability is indeed 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages. 4 out of 12 people are vegetarians. To find the percentage, I can divide 4 by 12 and multiply by 100, which is approximately 33.33%. So, there's a 33.33% chance that a randomly chosen person is a vegetarian.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that vegetarians make up one-third of the group, since 4 divided by 12 is 1/3. So, yes, the probability is 1/3.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\nMaybe the fact that vegans are also vegetarians could complicate things, but in this context, it's specified that there are separate counts for vegetarians and vegans. So, probably, vegetarians here mean lacto-ovo vegetarians who eat dairy and eggs, while vegans do not eat those. But since the question distinguishes between them, I think they are considered separate groups.\n\nTherefore, the number of vegetarians is 4, and the total number of people is 12, so the probability is 4/12 or 1/3.\n\nI don't see any other factors that would affect this calculation. So, I'm confident that 1/3 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
