        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with 120 cars in total. On a given day, 75% of them are rented out. We need to find out how many more cars need to be rented to reach an 85% occupancy rate.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many cars are currently rented. If 75% of 120 cars are rented, we can calculate that by multiplying 120 by 75% or 0.75.\n\nSo, 120 * 0.75 = 90 cars are currently rented.\n\nNext, we want to reach an 85% occupancy rate. So, we need to find out what 85% of 120 cars is.\n\n120 * 0.85 = 102 cars.\n\nThat means, to reach 85% occupancy, the company needs to have 102 cars rented out.\n\nNow, to find out how many more cars need to be rented, we subtract the current number of rented cars from the target number.\n\n102 - 90 = 12 cars.\n\nSo, the company needs to rent out 12 more cars to reach an 85% occupancy rate.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure we're correct. If they have 120 cars and they rent out 12 more, that would be 90 + 12 = 102 cars rented. 102 divided by 120 is indeed 0.85, which is 85%.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in terms of percentages. The difference between 85% and 75% is 10%. So, 10% of 120 cars is also 12 cars, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nIt seems straightforward, but sometimes these problems have tricks, so it's good to verify in multiple ways.\n\nWait a minute, another way to look at it is to consider that the number of cars available for rent doesn't change; it's still 120 cars. So, the only variable is how many are rented out.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent this.\n\nLet x be the number of additional cars that need to be rented.\n\nSo, current rented cars + x = 85% of total cars.\n\nThat is, 90 + x = 0.85 * 120.\n\nWe already know that 0.85 * 120 = 102, so:\n\n90 + x = 102.\n\nSolving for x: x = 102 - 90 = 12.\n\nAgain, we get the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of percentages, every car represents a certain percentage of the total.\n\nEach car is 1/120 of the total fleet.\n\nSo, to increase occupancy from 75% to 85%, that's a 10% increase.\n\n10% of 120 cars is 12 cars, which aligns with our previous calculations.\n\nI think we can be confident that the answer is 12 cars.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we might have missed.\n\nIs there any possibility that the total number of cars changes? The problem says the company has 120 cars, and we're considering them all available for rent. If some cars are not available for rent, that would affect the calculation, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"on a given day,\" but again, without any additional constraints or time factors, it seems straightforward.\n\nAnother angle: if the company has a fleet of 120 cars, but some are being maintained or are unavailable for some reason, then the occupancy rate would be calculated based on the available cars, not the total fleet. But again, the problem states \"120 cars,\" and implies that all are available for rent, with 75% rented out.\n\nSo, I don't think there are hidden variables here.\n\nTherefore, the straightforward approach seems correct: calculate the current number of rented cars, determine the target number for 85% occupancy, and find the difference.\n\nWhich is 12 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
