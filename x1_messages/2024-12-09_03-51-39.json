        "content": "So there are 20 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. We need to find out how many handshakes there will be in total. Hmm, this sounds like a problem about combinations, where order doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have a group of people and you want to find out how many ways they can pair up for handshakes, you're basically looking for the number of unique pairs you can form from that group. In math terms, that's called a combination, right? Specifically, it's \"20 choose 2,\" because you're choosing 2 people out of 20 to shake hands.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k! \\times (n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(n\\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\(n!\\) is the factorial of n, which means the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nSo in this case, \\(n = 20\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times (20 - 2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I know that factorials can get really big, but in this fraction, a lot of terms will cancel out. Specifically, 20! is 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!, so the 18! in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18!}{2! \\times 18!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2!}\n\\]\n\nAnd 2! is just 2 \u00d7 1, which is 2.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there will be 190 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for 20 people, the first person shakes hands with 19 others, the second person shakes hands with 18 others (since they've already shaken hands with the first person), the third shakes hands with 17 others, and so on, down to the last person who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n19 + 18 + 17 + ... + 1\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term \\(a_1 = 19\\), the last term \\(a_{19} = 1\\), and the number of terms is 19.\n\nThe sum \\(s\\) of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of terms,\n\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n\n- \\(a_n\\) is the last term.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{19}{2} \\times (19 + 1) = \\frac{19}{2} \\times 20 = 19 \\times 10 = 190\n\\]\n\nAgain, we get 190 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a formula for the number of handshakes in a group of people, which is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of people. Let's see:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nOnce more, 190 handshakes.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 190 as the answer. That makes me confident that 190 is the correct number of handshakes.\n\nWait, but the question mentions Tom and Jane specifically. Does that change anything? I don't think so, because the problem says \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" which includes Tom and Jane. So, their inclusion doesn't alter the overall calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if handshakes between specific pairs matters. For example, does the handshake between Tom and Jane count differently than between others? The problem doesn't suggest that, so all handshakes are equally counted.\n\nAlso, assuming that no one shakes hands with themselves, which makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is graph theory, where each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. The problem is then asking for the number of edges in a complete graph with 20 vertices. The formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with \\(n\\) vertices is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\), which again gives us \\(\\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\\).\n\nSo, across different mathematical approaches\u2014combinations, arithmetic series, and graph theory\u2014we arrive at the same answer: 190 handshakes.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the total number of handshakes is 190.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
