Calculate the acreage for each type of amenity and estimate the cost of construction based on average costs per acre ($200,000 for playgrounds, $150,000 for sports fields, and $100,000 for walking trails and green spaces).

        "content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about planning a new public park. The park is 50 acres in total, and it's going to have different areas like playgrounds, sports fields, and walking trails. The problem gives percentages for each type of amenity, and also some costs associated with them. I need to calculate the acreage for each part and then estimate the construction and annual maintenance costs.\n\nFirst, let's break down the acreage. The park is 50 acres altogether. 20% of that is allocated for playgrounds, 30% for sports fields, and the remaining 50% for walking trails and green spaces.\n\nSo, to find out how many acres each part gets, I'll multiply the total acres by the respective percentages.\n\nFor playgrounds:\n\n20% of 50 acres is 0.20 \u00d7 50 = 10 acres.\n\nFor sports fields:\n\n30% of 50 acres is 0.30 \u00d7 50 = 15 acres.\n\nAnd for walking trails and green spaces:\n\n50% of 50 acres is 0.50 \u00d7 50 = 25 acres.\n\nAlright, so we have:\n\n- Playground: 10 acres\n\n- Sports fields: 15 acres\n\n- Walking trails and green spaces: 25 acres\n\nNext, I need to estimate the construction cost based on the given average costs per acre.\n\nThe costs are:\n\n- $200,000 per acre for playgrounds\n\n- $150,000 per acre for sports fields\n\n- $100,000 per acre for walking trails and green spaces\n\nSo, the construction cost for each part would be:\n\nPlaygrounds:\n\n10 acres \u00d7 $200,000/acre = $2,000,000\n\nSports fields:\n\n15 acres \u00d7 $150,000/acre = $2,250,000\n\nWalking trails and green spaces:\n\n25 acres \u00d7 $100,000/acre = $2,500,000\n\nNow, to find the total construction cost, I'll add these amounts together:\n\n$2,000,000 + $2,250,000 + $2,500,000 = $6,750,000\n\nSo, the total construction cost is $6,750,000.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the annual maintenance cost, which is estimated to be 5% of the initial construction cost.\n\nSo, 5% of $6,750,000 is 0.05 \u00d7 $6,750,000 = $337,500.\n\nTherefore, the annual maintenance cost is $337,500.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, acreage calculations:\n\n- Playground: 20% of 50 acres = 10 acres\n\n- Sports fields: 30% of 50 acres = 15 acres\n\n- Walking trails and green spaces: 50% of 50 acres = 25 acres\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, construction costs:\n\n- Playground: 10 acres \u00d7 $200,000 = $2,000,000\n\n- Sports fields: 15 acres \u00d7 $150,000 = $2,250,000\n\n- Walking trails and green spaces: 25 acres \u00d7 $100,000 = $2,500,000\n\nTotal construction cost: $2,000,000 + $2,250,000 + $2,500,000 = $6,750,000\n\nAnnual maintenance: 5% of $6,750,000 = $337,500\n\nEverything checks out. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total construction cost for the park is $\\boxed{6750000}$, and the annual maintenance cost is $\\boxed{337500}$."
