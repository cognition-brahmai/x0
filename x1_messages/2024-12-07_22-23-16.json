        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here: if you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what's the probability that the sum of the two rolls will be equal to 9? Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that a fair six-sided die has sides numbered from 1 to 6, and each side has an equal chance of landing face up. Since the die is rolled twice, I need to consider all possible outcomes of these two rolls and then figure out how many of those outcomes add up to 9.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die twice is 6 options for the first roll multiplied by 6 options for the second roll, which gives me 36 possible outcomes. That makes sense because each roll is independent of the other.\n\nNow, I need to find out in how many of these 36 outcomes the sum is 9. Let me list out the pairs of numbers that add up to 9:\n\n- 3 and 6 (because 3 + 6 = 9)\n\n- 4 and 5 (because 4 + 5 = 9)\n\n- 5 and 4 (because 5 + 4 = 9)\n\n- 6 and 3 (because 6 + 3 = 9)\n\nWait, is that all? Let's see: 2 and 7 would be 9, but 7 is not on a six-sided die, so that's not possible. Similarly, 1 and 8 won't work because 8 is too big. So, only the pairs I listed add up to 9.\n\nBut hold on, I have to consider the order of the rolls. Does order matter here? Well, in probability, unless specified otherwise, we usually consider each roll as distinct. So, rolling a 3 first and then a 6 is different from rolling a 6 first and then a 3.\n\nLooking back at my list, I have:\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,3)\n\nThat's four outcomes that result in a sum of 9.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 4 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes.\n\nTo simplify that fraction: 4/36 = 1/9.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/9.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the concept of combinations or something.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as the number of ways to get a sum of 9 with two dice.\n\nI recall that for two dice, the number of ways to get a particular sum can be found by considering the number of integer solutions to the equation x + y = 9, where x and y are the results of the two dice, each ranging from 1 to 6.\n\nSo, solving for x and y where 1 \u2264 x \u2264 6 and 1 \u2264 y \u2264 6, and x + y = 9.\n\nLet's list possible x and y:\n\n- x=3, y=6\n\n- x=4, y=5\n\n- x=5, y=4\n\n- x=6, y=3\n\nAgain, same four pairs as before.\n\nSo, confirming that there are indeed four favorable outcomes.\n\nAnd since there are 36 possible outcomes in total, the probability remains 4/36, which is 1/9.\n\nAlternatively, some people might prefer to express this as a decimal or a percentage.\n\n1 divided by 9 is approximately 0.111..., which is about 11.11%.\n\nSo, the probability is roughly 11.11%.\n\nBut I think leaving it as a fraction, 1/9, is more precise and acceptable in most mathematical contexts.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nWait, is there a way to use probability rules here, like conditional probability or something?\n\nWell, for two independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nBut in this case, the two rolls are independent, so the probability of getting a specific pair is (1/6)*(1/6)=1/36, which aligns with what I did earlier.\n\nSince I have four such pairs that sum to 9, multiplying 4*(1/36)=1/9 again.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the answer seems to be 1/9.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. It seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider the possibility of rolling the same number twice, like doubles.\n\nBut in this case, since the sum is 9, which is odd, it's not possible to have doubles because doubles would be like (1,1), (2,2), etc., which all sum to even numbers.\n\nSpecifically, 1+1=2, 2+2=4, 3+3=6, 4+4=8, 5+5=10, 6+6=12.\n\nNone of these sums is 9, so no need to worry about doubles in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, my final answer remains 1/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{9}} \\]"
