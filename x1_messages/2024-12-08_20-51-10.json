        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer has chickens and cows, and together, these animals have a total of 40 heads and 112 legs. I need to figure out how many chickens and how many cows there are. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that both chickens and cows have heads, and they have legs too, but different numbers of legs. Chickens usually have 1 head and 2 legs, right? And cows have 1 head and 4 legs. So, that's something to work with.\n\nLet me try to set this up with some equations. Let's say the number of chickens is C, and the number of cows is K. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads should be the sum of the chickens and cows. So:\n\nC + K = 40\n\nThat makes sense. Now, for the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs would be:\n\n2C + 4K = 112\n\nOkay, now I have two equations:\n\n1) C + K = 40\n\n2) 2C + 4K = 112\n\nI need to solve for C and K. This looks like a system of linear equations. I can use either substitution or elimination method. Maybe elimination is simpler here.\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 2, I get:\n\n2C + 2K = 80\n\nNow, I can subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(2C + 4K) - (2C + 2K) = 112 - 80\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2K = 32\n\nSo, K = 16\n\nNow that I have K, I can plug it back into the first equation to find C:\n\nC + 16 = 40\n\nTherefore, C = 40 - 16 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 chickens and 16 cows.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If there are 24 chickens with 2 legs each, that's 48 legs. And 16 cows with 4 legs each, that's 64 legs. Total legs: 48 + 64 = 112, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, 24 + 16 = 40 heads, which also matches. So, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the difference in legs. If all 40 animals were chickens, they would have 80 legs in total (40 * 2). But we have 112 legs, which is 32 legs more than 80. Since each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, the number of cows would be 32 / 2 = 16. Then, chickens would be 40 - 16 = 24.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the substitution method, from the first equation, C = 40 - K. Plugging that into the second equation:\n\n2(40 - K) + 4K = 112\n\n80 - 2K + 4K = 112\n\n80 + 2K = 112\n\n2K = 32\n\nK = 16\n\nThen, C = 40 - 16 = 24\n\nSame result again. Seems consistent.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The farmer has 24 chickens and 16 cows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24 \\text{ chickens and } 16 \\text{ cows}} \\]"
