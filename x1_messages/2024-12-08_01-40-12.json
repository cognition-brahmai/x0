It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how quicksort works:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot element**: This can be any element from the array, but commonly it's the last element.\n\n2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final sorted position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot**.\n\nNow, let's implement this in C++. I'll provide a detailed code with comments to explain each part.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to swap two elements\nvoid swap(int& a, int& b) {\n    int temp = a;\n    a = b;\n    b = temp;\n}\n\n// Partition function\nint partition(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {\n    // Choose the last element as pivot\n    int pivot = arr[high];\n    int i = low - 1; // Index of smaller element\n\n    for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {\n        // If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot\n        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {\n            i++; // Increment index of smaller element\n            swap(arr[i], arr[j]);\n        }\n    }\n    swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);\n    return (i + 1);\n}\n\n// Quicksort function\nvoid quicksort(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {\n    if (low < high) {\n        // pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place\n        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);\n\n        // Recursively sort elements before partition and after partition\n        quicksort(arr, low, pi - 1);\n        quicksort(arr, pi + 1, high);\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to print an array\nvoid printArray(const vector<int>& arr) {\n    for (int num : arr) {\n        cout << num << \" \";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n}\n\n// Main function\nint main() {\n    vector<int> arr = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};\n    int n = arr.size();\n    cout << \"Original array: \\n\";\n    printArray(arr);\n\n    quicksort(arr, 0, n - 1);\n\n    cout << \"Sorted array: \\n\";\n    printArray(arr);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Swap Function**: A helper function to swap two elements in the array.\n\n2. **Partition Function**:\n   - Selects the last element as the pivot.\n   - Rearranges the array so that elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left, and elements greater are on the right.\n   - Returns the index of the pivot element after partitioning.\n\n3. **Quicksort Function**:\n   - Recursively sorts the sub-arrays before and after the partition index.\n   - The base case is when the sub-array has fewer than two elements.\n\n4. **PrintArray Function**: A utility function to print the array.\n\n5. **Main Function**:\n   - Initializes an array.\n   - Prints the original array.\n   - Calls the quicksort function.\n   - Prints the sorted array.\n\nThis implementation should give you a good starting point for understanding and using quicksort in C++.
