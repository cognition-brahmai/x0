        "content": "The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for perimeter is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nGiven that the length (L) is 12 meters and the width (W) is 8 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2(12) + 2(8)\n\nFirst, multiply 2 by 12:\n\n2 * 12 = 24\n\nThen, multiply 2 by 8:\n\n2 * 8 = 16\n\nNow, add these two results together:\n\n24 + 16 = 40\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the garden is 40 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
