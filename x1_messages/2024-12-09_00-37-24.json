        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a TypeScript class for a \"Product\" that includes properties like name, price, and description. I also need to implement methods to calculate discounts based on the quantity purchased and to display the product information in a formatted way.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the basic structure of the class with the required properties. In TypeScript, classes are defined with the `class` keyword, and properties can be declared with access modifiers like `public`, `private`, or `protected`. Since these properties need to be accessible from outside the class for reading and possibly writing, I'll make them public.\n\nSo, the initial class might look like this:\n\n```typescript\nclass Product {\n    public name: string;\n    public price: number;\n    public description: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, price: number, description: string) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.price = price;\n        this.description = description;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, I need to implement a method to calculate discounts based on the quantity purchased. Let's assume that the discount increases with the quantity purchased. For simplicity, I'll implement a step-based discount where different quantity ranges correspond to different discount rates.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 1 to 9 items: no discount\n\n- 10 to 49 items: 5% discount\n\n- 50 to 99 items: 10% discount\n\n- 100 or more items: 15% discount\n\nI'll create a method called `calculateDiscountedPrice` that takes the quantity as an argument and returns the total price after applying the appropriate discount.\n\nHere's how I might implement that:\n\n```typescript\ncalculateDiscountedPrice(quantity: number): number {\n    let discountRate: number;\n\n    if (quantity < 10) {\n        discountRate = 0;\n    } else if (quantity < 50) {\n        discountRate = 0.05;\n    } else if (quantity < 100) {\n        discountRate = 0.10;\n    } else {\n        discountRate = 0.15;\n    }\n\n    const discountedPrice = this.price * (1 - discountRate);\n    return discountedPrice * quantity;\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to implement a method to display the product information in a formatted manner. This could be a simple string representation of the product, including its name, price, and description.\n\nI'll create a method called `displayInfo` that returns a formatted string.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```typescript\ndisplayInfo(): string {\n    return `Product: ${this.name}\\nPrice: $${this.price}\\nDescription: ${this.description}`;\n}\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete `Product` class would look like this:\n\n```typescript\nclass Product {\n    public name: string;\n    public price: number;\n    public description: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, price: number, description: string) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.price = price;\n        this.description = description;\n    }\n\n    calculateDiscountedPrice(quantity: number): number {\n        let discountRate: number;\n\n        if (quantity < 10) {\n            discountRate = 0;\n        } else if (quantity < 50) {\n            discountRate = 0.05;\n        } else if (quantity < 100) {\n            discountRate = 0.10;\n        } else {\n            discountRate = 0.15;\n        }\n\n        const discountedPrice = this.price * (1 - discountRate);\n        return discountedPrice * quantity;\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): string {\n        return `Product: ${this.name}\\nPrice: $${this.price}\\nDescription: ${this.description}`;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo make this class more robust, I might want to add some validation to the constructor to ensure that the price is a positive number and that the name and description are non-empty strings.\n\nI can do this by adding checks in the constructor and throwing errors if the validation fails.\n\nHere's an updated version with validation:\n\n```typescript\nclass Product {\n    public name: string;\n    public price: number;\n    public description: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, price: number, description: string) {\n        if (!name || name.trim() === \"\") {\n            throw new Error(\"Name must be a non-empty string.\");\n        }\n        if (price <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Price must be a positive number.\");\n        }\n        if (!description || description.trim() === \"\") {\n            throw new Error(\"Description must be a non-empty string.\");\n        }\n\n        this.name = name;\n        this.price = price;\n        this.description = description;\n    }\n\n    calculateDiscountedPrice(quantity: number): number {\n        if (quantity <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Quantity must be a positive integer.\");\n        }\n\n        let discountRate: number;\n\n        if (quantity < 10) {\n            discountRate = 0;\n        } else if (quantity < 50) {\n            discountRate = 0.05;\n        } else if (quantity < 100) {\n            discountRate = 0.10;\n        } else {\n            discountRate = 0.15;\n        }\n\n        const discountedPrice = this.price * (1 - discountRate);\n        return discountedPrice * quantity;\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): string {\n        return `Product: ${this.name}\\nPrice: $${this.price}\\nDescription: ${this.description}`;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis class now includes basic validation to ensure that the product data is valid and that the quantity purchased is a positive integer.\n\nI can further enhance this class by making the properties read-only, so they can't be changed after the object is created. In TypeScript, I can do this by using the `readonly` keyword.\n\nHere's the updated class with read-only properties:\n\n```typescript\nclass Product {\n    public readonly name: string;\n    public readonly price: number;\n    public readonly description: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, price: number, description: string) {\n        if (!name || name.trim() === \"\") {\n            throw new Error(\"Name must be a non-empty string.\");\n        }\n        if (price <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Price must be a positive number.\");\n        }\n        if (!description || description.trim() === \"\") {\n            throw new Error(\"Description must be a non-empty string.\");\n        }\n\n        this.name = name;\n        this.price = price;\n        this.description = description;\n    }\n\n    calculateDiscountedPrice(quantity: number): number {\n        if (quantity <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Quantity must be a positive integer.\");\n        }\n\n        let discountRate: number;\n\n        if (quantity < 10) {\n            discountRate = 0;\n        } else if (quantity < 50) {\n            discountRate = 0.05;\n        } else if (quantity < 100) {\n            discountRate = 0.10;\n        } else {\n            discountRate = 0.15;\n        }\n\n        const discountedPrice = this.price * (1 - discountRate);\n        return discountedPrice * quantity;\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): string {\n        return `Product: ${this.name}\\nPrice: $${this.price}\\nDescription: ${this.description}`;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy making the properties read-only, I ensure that once a product is created, its name, price, and description cannot be changed, which can be important for maintaining data integrity.\n\nThis should cover the requirements for the \"Product\" class in TypeScript. If there are any specific additional features or modifications needed, please let me know.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to design a TypeScript class representing a product with properties such as name, price, and description. We also need to implement methods to calculate discounts based on the quantity purchased and to display product information in a formatted manner.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Class Definition**: Define a class `Product` with read-only properties for name, price, and description.\n2. **Constructor Validation**: Ensure that the provided name and description are non-empty strings and that the price is a positive number.\n3. **Discount Calculation**: Implement a method `calculateDiscountedPrice` that applies discounts based on the quantity purchased using predefined discount tiers.\n4. **Information Display**: Implement a method `displayInfo` to return a formatted string containing the product's name, price, and description.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```typescript\nclass Product {\n    public readonly name: string;\n    public readonly price: number;\n    public readonly description: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, price: number, description: string) {\n        if (!name || name.trim() === \"\") {\n            throw new Error(\"Name must be a non-empty string.\");\n        }\n        if (price <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Price must be a positive number.\");\n        }\n        if (!description || description.trim() === \"\") {\n            throw new Error(\"Description must be a non-empty string.\");\n        }\n\n        this.name = name;\n        this.price = price;\n        this.description = description;\n    }\n\n    calculateDiscountedPrice(quantity: number): number {\n        if (quantity <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Quantity must be a positive integer.\");\n        }\n\n        let discountRate: number;\n\n        if (quantity < 10) {\n            discountRate = 0;\n        } else if (quantity < 50) {\n            discountRate = 0.05;\n        } else if (quantity < 100) {\n            discountRate = 0.10;\n        } else {\n            discountRate = 0.15;\n        }\n\n        const discountedPrice = this.price * (1 - discountRate);\n        return discountedPrice * quantity;\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): string {\n        return `Product: ${this.name}\\nPrice: $${this.price}\\nDescription: ${this.description}`;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Class and Properties**: The `Product` class has read-only properties for name, price, and description ensured by the `readonly` keyword.\n2. **Constructor**: Validates that name and description are non-empty strings and price is a positive number. Throws errors if validation fails.\n3. **calculateDiscountedPrice Method**: Determines the discount rate based on the quantity purchased and calculates the total discounted price.\n4. **displayInfo Method**: Returns a formatted string that displays the product's name, price, and description.\n\nThis implementation ensures data integrity and provides the necessary functionality to manage product information and pricing effectively."
