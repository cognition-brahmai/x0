        "content": "So I have this expression to simplify: 4(2x - 3) - 6(x + 1). Hmm, okay, I need to simplify it step by step. First, I should probably use the distributive property to multiply the numbers outside the parentheses by each term inside the parentheses.\n\nSo, for the first part, 4 times (2x - 3), that means I multiply 4 by 2x and then 4 by -3. That should give me 4 * 2x which is 8x, and 4 * -3 which is -12. So, that part becomes 8x - 12.\n\nNow, for the second part, -6 times (x + 1). I need to multiply -6 by x and then -6 by 1. That gives me -6x and -6*1 which is -6. So, that part is -6x - 6.\n\nNow, putting it all together, I have 8x - 12 - 6x - 6. Next, I need to combine like terms. The like terms here are the x terms and the constant terms.\n\nSo, 8x minus 6x is 2x, and -12 minus 6 is -18. Therefore, the simplified expression should be 2x - 18.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Did I distribute correctly and combine the like terms properly? Let's see:\n\nFirst distribution: 4(2x - 3) = 8x - 12. That seems right.\n\nSecond distribution: -6(x + 1) = -6x - 6. That also seems correct.\n\nCombining like terms: 8x - 6x = 2x, and -12 - 6 = -18. Yep, that looks good.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 2x - 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2x - 18} \\]\n"
