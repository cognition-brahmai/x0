        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 2000 widgets per day, and it operates 5 days a week. But it takes 2 weeks off each year for maintenance. I need to find out how many widgets it produces in one year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many weeks the factory operates in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, and the factory takes 2 weeks off for maintenance. So, the number of weeks it operates is:\n\n52 weeks - 2 weeks = 50 weeks\n\nNow, since it operates 5 days a week, the total number of operating days in a year is:\n\n50 weeks * 5 days/week = 250 days\n\nNext, it produces 2000 widgets per day. So, the total number of widgets produced in a year is:\n\n250 days * 2000 widgets/day = 500,000 widgets\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. There are indeed 52 weeks in a year, and if it takes 2 weeks off, that leaves 50 weeks. Operating 5 days a week would be 50 * 5 = 250 days. And 250 days * 2000 widgets/day does equal 500,000 widgets.\n\nI think that's the correct calculation. But maybe I should consider if there are any leap years or extra days. A year has 365 days, and 52 weeks account for 364 days, leaving one extra day. But since the factory operates on a weekly schedule, and it's taking exactly 2 weeks off, it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a leap year with 366 days, but again, since it's based on weeks, it might not make a difference. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume a standard year.\n\nSo, the factory produces 500,000 widgets in one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500000} \\]"
