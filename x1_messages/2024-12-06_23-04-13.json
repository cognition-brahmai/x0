        "content": "Sure! Newton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ F = m \\times a \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the force in newtons (N),\n- \\( m \\) is the mass in kilograms (kg),\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration in meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2).\n\nGiven that the mass \\( m \\) is 10 kg and the acceleration \\( a \\) is 5 m/s\u00b2, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ F = 10 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 5 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nNow, performing the multiplication:\n\n\\[ F = 50 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nSo, the force required to accelerate a 10 kg object at a rate of 5 m/s\u00b2 is 50 newtons."
