        "content": "C. Cultural Anthropology\nCultural anthropology is the branch of anthropology that focuses on the study of human societies and cultures. It examines the ways in which people live, interact, and make sense of the world around them. This field is particularly concerned with understanding the social, cultural, and historical contexts that shape human behavior and experience.\n\nWhen it comes to studying the societal impact of a new technology, cultural anthropology is well-suited for this task. Anthropologists in this field can conduct ethnographic research, which involves immersing themselves in a particular community or social group to observe and document their practices, beliefs, and interactions. This approach allows them to gather firsthand data on how people are using the new technology, what changes it is bringing about in their daily lives, and how it is affecting their social relationships and cultural norms.\n\nMoreover, cultural anthropologists are trained to consider the broader cultural and historical contexts in which technologies are introduced and used. They can analyze how power dynamics, economic structures, and political systems influence the adoption and impact of new technologies. They can also explore the ethical implications of these technologies and their potential consequences for different social groups.\n\nIn contrast, physical anthropology focuses on the biological aspects of humans, such as evolution, genetics, and physiology. While it may touch upon the biological effects of technology, it is not primarily concerned with societal impacts. Archeology, on the other hand, studies human history and prehistory through the analysis of material remains, such as artifacts and structures. While archeologists may sometimes examine the role of technology in past societies, their focus is more on understanding historical contexts rather than contemporary societal impacts.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, cultural anthropology is the field most likely to study the societal impact of a new technology."
