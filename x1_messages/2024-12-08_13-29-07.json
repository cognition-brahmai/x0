Each plan should have an associated evidence value which is the output of one of the available functions given an input string.\n\nHere are the tools that can be used:\nSearchEngine[input]: A tool that allows you to search for information on the internet. This tool is useful in finding relevant websites or pages that may contain the answer to your question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from webpages given their URLs. The input is one or more links, and it produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkCollector[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAnswerBot[input]: A question answering bot that can answer questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :data[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given :data1:?\n\nThe input to each function should be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a data variable, e.g., AnswerBot[What is the capital of France, given :data3:?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action to take based on the input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :data0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:data[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book '1984' and what other books has he written?"
