        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 buses, each making 10 round trips per day, and each round trip is 8 miles. I need to find the total distance covered by all the buses in a day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much distance one bus covers in a day. Since each bus makes 10 round trips and each round trip is 8 miles, I can multiply 10 by 8 to get the daily distance for one bus.\n\nSo, 10 round trips \u00d7 8 miles per round trip = 80 miles per bus per day.\n\nNow, there are 5 buses, so I need to multiply the distance covered by one bus by the number of buses to get the total distance.\n\nThat would be 5 buses \u00d7 80 miles per bus = 400 miles.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 10 round trips per bus, each round trip is 8 miles: 10 \u00d7 8 = 80 miles per bus.\n\nThen, 5 buses \u00d7 80 miles = 400 miles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the total number of round trips made by all buses in a day and then multiply by the distance per round trip.\n\nTotal round trips by all buses: 5 buses \u00d7 10 round trips = 50 round trips.\n\nThen, 50 round trips \u00d7 8 miles per round trip = 400 miles.\n\nSame answer.\n\nMaybe I can approach it another way to confirm.\n\nIf one bus makes 10 round trips of 8 miles each, that's 80 miles.\n\nFive buses would indeed cover 5 \u00d7 80 = 400 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each round trip is 8 miles, and there are 5 buses each making 10 trips, it's the same as 50 trips of 8 miles each, totaling 400 miles.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the total distance covered by all the buses in a day is 400 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
