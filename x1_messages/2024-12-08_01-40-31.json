        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 200 widgets per hour. It's running for an 8-hour shift, and there's a malfunction where every 50th widget is defective. We need to find out how many non-defective widgets are produced during this shift.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total number of widgets produced in 8 hours. Since the factory produces 200 widgets per hour, multiplying that by 8 should give me the total production.\n\nTotal widgets = 200 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 1600 widgets\n\nNow, every 50th widget is defective. To find out how many defective widgets there are in 1600, I need to divide the total number of widgets by 50.\n\nDefective widgets = 1600 \u00f7 50 = 32 widgets\n\nSo, there are 32 defective widgets.\n\nTo find the number of non-defective widgets, I'll subtract the defective ones from the total production.\n\nNon-defective widgets = Total widgets - Defective widgets = 1600 - 32 = 1568 widgets\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let me double-check. If every 50th widget is defective, then indeed, dividing the total by 50 should give the number of defective widgets. And subtracting that from the total should give the non-defective ones.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any overlap or something. For example, if the malfunction affects every 50th widget, and the production is constant, then my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as for every 50 widgets, 1 is defective and 49 are non-defective. So, in groups of 50, there are 49 non-defective widgets.\n\nFirst, find how many such groups there are in 1600 widgets.\n\nNumber of groups = 1600 \u00f7 50 = 32\n\nThen, non-defective widgets = 32 groups \u00d7 49 non-defective per group = 1568 widgets\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident now.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-defective widgets produced in an 8-hour shift is 1568.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1568} \\]"
