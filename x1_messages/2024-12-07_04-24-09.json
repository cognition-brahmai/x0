        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory produces 250 units of product X per hour, and it operates for 16 hours a day. First, I need to find out how many units are produced in one day.\n\nTo find the daily production, I'll multiply the hourly production by the number of hours in a day:\n\n250 units/hour * 16 hours/day = 4,000 units/day\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 4,000 units each day. Now, it operates for 6 days a week, so let's find out the weekly production.\n\nWeekly production = 4,000 units/day * 6 days/week = 24,000 units/week\n\nAlright, so every week the factory produces 24,000 units. The question is asking for the production over 4 weeks, so I'll multiply the weekly production by 4.\n\nTotal production in 4 weeks = 24,000 units/week * 4 weeks = 96,000 units\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the total number of hours the factory operates in 4 weeks and then multiply by the hourly production.\n\nFirst, find the total number of hours per day the factory operates: 16 hours/day\n\nThen, the number of days per week: 6 days/week\n\nSo, hours per week = 16 hours/day * 6 days/week = 96 hours/week\n\nNow, hours in 4 weeks = 96 hours/week * 4 weeks = 384 hours\n\nNow, multiply total hours by hourly production:\n\n250 units/hour * 384 hours = 96,000 units\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the factory will produce 96,000 units of product X in 4 weeks.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. For example, are there any downtime or maintenance periods that might reduce the operating hours? The question doesn't mention any, so I'll assume the factory operates continuously for the specified hours.\n\nAlso, the production rate is constant at 250 units per hour, with no mention of variations, so I'll stick with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory operates for exactly 16 hours each day and 6 days each week, without any holidays or changes in the schedule. Again, the question states it operates for 6 days a week, so I'll assume that's the case.\n\nSo, based on the given information, the total production over 4 weeks is 96,000 units.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the total number of days in 4 weeks first.\n\nNumber of days in 4 weeks = 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days\n\nNow, production per day is 4,000 units, so total production = 4,000 units/day * 24 days = 96,000 units\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nLet me also consider the units to ensure they are consistent throughout the calculation.\n\n- Hourly production: 250 units/hour\n\n- Hours per day: 16 hours/day\n\n- Days per week: 6 days/week\n\n- Weeks: 4\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n250 units/hour * 16 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 96,000 units\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the daily production first, then weekly, then multiplied by the number of weeks, I get the same result.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory will produce 96,000 units of product X in 4 weeks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96000} \\]"
