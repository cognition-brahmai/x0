The color of an eggshell, whether it's brown or white, doesn't affect the nutritional value of the egg inside. Both brown and white eggs have similar nutrient profiles, including protein, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nThe main difference between brown and white eggs is the breed of the hen that lays them. Brown eggs are typically laid by hens with red feathers and red earlobes, while white eggs are laid by hens with white feathers and white earlobes. Some people believe that brown eggs are healthier because they come from hens that are raised in more natural environments, but this isn't necessarily true.\n\nIn terms of taste, some people claim that brown eggs taste better than white eggs, but again, this is subjective and not supported by scientific evidence. The flavor of an egg can be influenced by the hen's diet, rather than the color of the shell.\n\nSo, in summary, there's no significant difference in nutrition or taste between brown and white eggs. The choice between the two comes down to personal preference or availability."
