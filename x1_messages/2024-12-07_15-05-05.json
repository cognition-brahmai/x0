        "content": "I believe there might be a bit of confusion here. \"The Ring Cycle\" is actually an opera cycle composed by Richard Wagner, consisting of four operas: \"Das Rheingold,\" \"Die Walk\u00fcre,\" \"Siegfried,\" and \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung.\" Each of these operas has its own music, but they are part of a larger narrative cycle rather than being symphonic poems.\n\nSymphonic poems, on the other hand, are single-movement orchestral works that often depict a narrative or evoke a specific idea or scene. They are typically composed in a freer form than traditional symphonies. Some famous composers of symphonic poems include Franz Liszt, who is often credited with inventing the genre, as well as Richard Strauss and Bed\u0159ich Smetana.\n\nIf you're thinking of a set of four symphonic poems that are thematically linked, it might be helpful to consider other cycles. For example, Smetana's \"M\u00e1 vlast\" is a cycle of six symphonic poems that depict the landscape and history of Bohemia. Similarly, Strauss composed several symphonic poems that sometimes form thematic groups, but not necessarily a cycle of four.\n\nPerhaps you could provide a bit more context or clarify which works you are referring to? I'd be happy to help you explore more about them."
