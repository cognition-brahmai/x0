        "content": "I'd be happy to help you design a C# Windows Forms application that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. Let's break down the steps needed to create this application.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Project\n\nFirst, open Visual Studio and create a new Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) project. Name it something like \"FactorialCalculator\".\n\n### Step 2: Design the User Interface\n\nOpen the Form1 designer and add the following controls:\n\n- A `Label` to instruct the user to enter a number.\n- A `TextBox` for the user to input the number.\n- A `Button` to trigger the calculation.\n- Another `Label` or `TextBox` to display the result.\n\nArrange these controls in a way that makes sense for your form. For example:\n\n- Label: \"Enter a non-negative integer:\"\n- TextBox: for user input\n- Button: \"Calculate Factorial\"\n- Result Label: to display the factorial result\n\n### Step 3: Add Event Handling for the Button\n\nDouble-click the \"Calculate Factorial\" button to create an event handler in the code-behind file (Form1.cs). This is where you'll write the code to calculate the factorial.\n\n### Step 4: Implement the Factorial Calculation\n\nIn the button's click event handler, you need to:\n\n1. Retrieve the input from the TextBox.\n2. Validate the input to ensure it's a non-negative integer.\n3. Calculate the factorial of the input number.\n4. Display the result in the result label.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void btnCalculate_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    // Step 1: Retrieve input\n    string input = txtInput.Text;\n\n    // Step 2: Validate input\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input))\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Please enter a number.\", \"Input Error\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (!int.TryParse(input, out int number))\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\", \"Input Error\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (number < 0)\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\", \"Input Error\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Step 3: Calculate factorial\n    try\n    {\n        long factorial = CalculateFactorial(number);\n        lblResult.Text = $\"Factorial of {number} is {factorial}\";\n    }\n    catch (OverflowException)\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"The factorial is too large to be calculated.\", \"Calculation Error\");\n    }\n}\n\nprivate long CalculateFactorial(int number)\n{\n    if (number == 0) return 1;\n\n    long result = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++)\n    {\n        result *= i;\n        if (result < 0)\n        {\n            // Detect overflow\n            throw new OverflowException();\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Handle Large Factorials\n\nFactorials can grow very large very quickly. In this example, we're using a `long` to store the result, which can handle factorials up to 20! (20 factorial). If you need to calculate larger factorials, you might need to use the `BigInteger` struct from the `System.Numerics` namespace.\n\nTo use `BigInteger`, you'll need to add a reference to `System.Numerics` in your project. Here's how you can modify the `CalculateFactorial` method to use `BigInteger`:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Numerics;\n\nprivate BigInteger CalculateFactorial(int number)\n{\n    if (number == 0) return BigInteger.One;\n\n    BigInteger result = BigInteger.One;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++)\n    {\n        result *= i;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nAnd update the result display accordingly:\n\n```csharp\nlblResult.Text = $\"Factorial of {number} is {factorial.ToString()}\";\n```\n\n### Step 6: Test the Application\n\nRun the application and test it with various inputs to ensure it handles both valid and invalid cases correctly. Check for edge cases like 0, 1, and large numbers to see how the application performs.\n\n### Step 7: Enhancements (Optional)\n\n- Add a checkbox to switch between showing results in `long` and `BigInteger`.\n- Implement a dropdown to select the calculation method (e.g., iterative or recursive).\n- Add a progress bar for very large calculations (though factorial calculations are generally fast).\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for your factorial calculator application. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
