The function doesn't directly answer the question; it finds a list of sites that may contain the answer.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response with newline-separated links.\nSiteScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. The input is one or more links, and the output is plain text content from these links.\nInfoQA[input]: A question-answering tool that answers questions based on general knowledge as well as context from previously gathered evidence.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action]\n#E1 = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action, based on #E1]\n#E2 = [next function call with input parameter, possibly referencing #E1]\n...\nFinal Answer: #En\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the Battle of Hastings and who were the key figures involved?"
