        "content": "Ah, that's an interesting question! So, you're asking about a common kitchen item that's used for baking and also for neutralizing odors, and it's chemically known as sodium bicarbonate. Let me think about this.\n\nI know that baking involves various ingredients that help in the rising of dough or batter, and one of the common agents for that is baking soda. Is baking soda the same as sodium bicarbonate? I think it is. Yes, baking soda is indeed sodium bicarbonate. It's a white crystalline powder that is extracted from the mineral natron or manufactured synthetically.\n\nIn baking, baking soda reacts with acidic components in batters, such as buttermilk, yogurt, or vinegar, to produce carbon dioxide gas. This gas forms bubbles in the batter, which causes the dough or batter to rise. That's why it's a leavening agent in baking.\n\nAside from baking, baking soda is also used for neutralizing odors. It's often placed in refrigerators or closets to absorb unpleasant smells because it can react with acidic odor molecules and neutralize them. It's also used in cleaning products for its abrasive properties and its ability to neutralize stains and odors.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the common kitchen item you're referring to is baking soda, which is chemically known as sodium bicarbonate. It's versatile and has uses beyond just baking, making it a staple in many households.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{baking soda}} \\]"
