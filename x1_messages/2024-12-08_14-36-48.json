        "content": "As you're traveling from the US to Australia and New Zealand, you'll need to have access to the local currencies of both countries.\n\nIn Australia, the currency is the Australian dollar (AUD). It's essential to have some Australian dollars on hand for expenses such as taxis, meals, and shopping.\n\nSimilarly, in New Zealand, the currency is the New Zealand dollar (NZD). Again, having some NZD will be helpful for your stay there.\n\nIt's a good idea to withdraw cash from ATMs using your debit or credit card once you arrive in each country, as this often provides better exchange rates than exchanging money in advance. Alternatively, you can exchange some currency before your trip at a local bank or currency exchange service.\n\nAlso, consider notifying your bank about your travel plans to avoid any issues with your cards being declined abroad.\n\nEnjoy your travels!"
