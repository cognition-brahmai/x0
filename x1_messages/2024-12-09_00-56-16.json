        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you classify these deserts based on their geographical locations. Let's go through each one:\n\n1. **Sahara**: The Sahara is located in North Africa. It's the largest hot desert in the world and stretches across multiple countries including Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan, and Tunisia.\n\n2. **Gobi**: The Gobi Desert is in Asia, specifically in parts of northern and northwestern China and southern Mongolia. It's known for its unique landscape and harsh climate.\n\n3. **Mojave**: The Mojave Desert is in North America, covering parts of southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and northwest Arizona in the United States.\n\n4. **Atacama**: The Atacama Desert is in South America, primarily in Chile, with smaller parts extending into Peru. It's one of the driest places on Earth.\n\n5. **Great Victoria**: The Great Victoria Desert is in Australia, covering parts of southern-central Western Australia and northwestern South Australia.\n\n6. **Kalahari**: The Kalahari Desert is in Southern Africa, covering parts of Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa.\n\n7. **Thar**: The Thar Desert, also known as the Great Indian Desert, is in Asia, mainly in western India and southeastern Pakistan.\n\nSo, summarizing by continent:\n\n- **Africa**: Sahara, Kalahari, Thar (though Thar also extends into Asia)\n\n- **Asia**: Gobi, Thar\n\n- **North America**: Mojave\n\n- **South America**: Atacama\n\n- **Australia**: Great Victoria\n\nNote that the Thar Desert spans both Asia and Africa, but since it's primarily located in Asia, it's usually classified under Asia.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
