        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and 95% of them pass the quality test. I need to find out how many fail the test each day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 95% of 1000 is, because that's the number that passes. Then, I can subtract that from 1000 to find out how many fail.\n\nAlternatively, since 95% pass, that means 5% fail, because 100% - 95% = 5%. So, I can directly calculate 5% of 1000 to find the number of failed widgets.\n\nLet me try the first method. 95% of 1000 is calculated as 0.95 times 1000, which is 950. So, 950 widgets pass the test. Then, the number that fail is 1000 minus 950, which is 50.\n\nNow, let me check with the second method. If 5% fail, then 5% of 1000 is 0.05 times 1000, which is also 50.\n\nBoth methods give me the same answer, which is good. So, 50 widgets fail the test each day.\n\nBut wait, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using fractions? 95% is the same as 95/100, which simplifies to 19/20. So, 19/20 of the widgets pass, and 1/20 fail.\n\nSo, 1/20 of 1000 is 50, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of probabilities, the probability of a widget passing is 0.95, so the probability of failing is 0.05. Then, the expected number of failures per day is 1000 times 0.05, which again is 50.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 50 widgets fail the test each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
