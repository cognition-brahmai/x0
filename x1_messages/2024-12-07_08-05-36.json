        "content": "Let's see here. We have two trains, one leaving Town A at 9 am going towards Town B at 60 mph, and another leaving Town B at 10 am going towards Town A at 80 mph. The distance between Town A and Town B is 300 miles. I need to figure out which train will be closer to Town A when they meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out when and where they meet. Let's set up some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the train from Town A travels for t hours until they meet. Since the train from Town B leaves at 10 am, which is one hour later, it travels for t - 1 hours.\n\nNow, the distance covered by the train from Town A is 60 mph * t hours. The distance covered by the train from Town B is 80 mph * (t - 1) hours. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should equal the total distance between the towns, which is 300 miles.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n60t + 80(t - 1) = 300\n\nLet me solve for t.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n60t + 80t - 80 = 300\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t - 80 = 300\n\nAdd 80 to both sides:\n\n140t = 380\n\nNow, divide both sides by 140:\n\nt = 380 / 140\n\nSimplify that:\n\nt = 19/7 hours\n\nWhich is approximately 2.714 hours.\n\nNow, I need to find out how far each train has traveled when they meet.\n\nFirst, the train from Town A has been traveling for t hours, which is 19/7 hours, at 60 mph.\n\nDistance = speed * time = 60 * (19/7) = 1140/7 miles \u2248 162.857 miles.\n\nThe train from Town B has been traveling for t - 1 hours, which is (19/7) - (7/7) = 12/7 hours, at 80 mph.\n\nDistance = 80 * (12/7) = 960/7 miles \u2248 137.143 miles.\n\nNow, since they meet at this point, I need to see which train is closer to Town A. The train from Town A has traveled approximately 162.857 miles from Town A, and the train from Town B has traveled approximately 137.143 miles from Town B.\n\nBut wait, the question is which train is closer to Town A when they meet. When they meet, they are at the same point, so both trains are at the same distance from Town A and Town B.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when they meet, they are at the same point, so both trains are at the same location, meaning they are equally close to Town A at that moment.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that one train might be closer to Town A than the other when they meet, but that doesn't make sense because they are at the same point.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking about which train has traveled less distance from Town A when they meet. In that case, the train from Town B has traveled less distance from Town A, since it left later and travels faster.\n\nWait, but the train from Town B left later, so it has less time to cover distance.\n\nWait, no, the train from Town B has been traveling for t - 1 = 12/7 hours, which is less time than the train from Town A, which has been traveling for t = 19/7 hours.\n\nBut in terms of distance from Town A, when they meet, both are at the same point, so the distance from Town A is the same for both.\n\nI think the confusion might be in interpreting \"which train will be closer to Town A when they meet.\" Since they meet at a single point, both are equally close to Town A at that moment.\n\nPerhaps the question intended to ask which train has traveled less distance from its starting point when they meet. In that case, the train from Town B has traveled less distance because it has been traveling for a shorter time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking which train is closer to its starting point, Town A or Town B, when they meet. But again, when they meet, both are at the same point between Town A and Town B.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the meeting point relative to Town A.\n\nWe already calculated that the train from Town A has traveled approximately 162.857 miles from Town A when they meet.\n\nSimilarly, the train from Town B has traveled approximately 137.143 miles from Town B when they meet.\n\nBut since they meet at the same point, the distance from Town A for both trains is the same, which is 162.857 miles.\n\nWait, but the distance from Town A should be the same for both trains at the meeting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the distance each train has traveled from its starting point.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the time between 9 am and 10 am. From 9 am to 10 am, the train from Town A is traveling alone towards Town B at 60 mph. So in that one hour, it covers 60 miles.\n\nTherefore, at 10 am, when the train from Town B starts, the remaining distance between the two trains is 300 - 60 = 240 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, with the train from Town A at 60 mph and the train from Town B at 80 mph. Their relative speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nSo, the time it takes for them to meet after 10 am is the remaining distance divided by their relative speed: 240 miles / 140 mph = 12/7 hours, which is approximately 1.714 hours.\n\nTherefore, the train from Town A has been traveling for 1 hour (from 9 am to 10 am) plus 12/7 hours, which totals to 1 + 12/7 = 19/7 hours, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, the train from Town B has been traveling for 12/7 hours.\n\nNow, the distance each train has traveled from its starting point when they meet is:\n\nTrain from Town A: 60 mph * 19/7 hours = 1140/7 miles \u2248 162.857 miles.\n\nTrain from Town B: 80 mph * 12/7 hours = 960/7 miles \u2248 137.143 miles.\n\nNow, since Town A is the reference point, the distance of the meeting point from Town A is the distance traveled by the train from Town A, which is approximately 162.857 miles.\n\nTherefore, both trains are at the same point, which is 162.857 miles from Town A.\n\nSo, in terms of distance from Town A, both trains are equally close when they meet.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking which train has traveled less distance from Town A when they meet.\n\nWait, the train from Town B started at Town B, which is 300 miles from Town A, and traveled 137.143 miles towards Town A, so its distance from Town A when they meet is 300 - 137.143 = 162.857 miles, which matches the distance traveled by the train from Town A.\n\nTherefore, both trains are 162.857 miles from Town A when they meet.\n\nSo, they are equally close to Town A when they meet.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that one train is closer than the other, but in reality, they are at the same point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, from 9 am to 10 am, the train from Town A travels 60 miles.\n\nSo, at 10 am, the distance between the two trains is 300 - 60 = 240 miles.\n\nThen, their relative speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nTime to meet after 10 am is 240 / 140 = 12/7 hours.\n\nDistance traveled by train from Town A after 10 am: 60 * 12/7 = 720/7 miles \u2248 102.857 miles.\n\nAdding the 60 miles it traveled from 9 am to 10 am, the total distance from Town A is 60 + 102.857 = 162.857 miles.\n\nDistance traveled by train from Town B: 80 * 12/7 = 960/7 miles \u2248 137.143 miles.\n\nSo, the meeting point is 162.857 miles from Town A, and 137.143 miles from Town B.\n\nTherefore, when they meet, both trains are at the same point, which is 162.857 miles from Town A.\n\nSo, neither train is closer to Town A than the other; they are both at the same distance from Town A.\n\nI think the answer is that both trains are equally close to Town A when they meet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Both trains are equally close to Town A when they meet.}} \\]"
