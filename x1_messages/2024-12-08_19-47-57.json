        "content": "Let's see. If the car rental company has 120 cars and 75% of them are rented out at any given time, I need to find out how many cars are available for rent on average during the day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars are rented out. If 75% are rented, then the number of rented cars is 75% of 120. To calculate that, I can multiply 120 by 0.75.\n\nSo, 120 times 0.75 is 90 cars rented out.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are available, I subtract the number of rented cars from the total number of cars.\n\nThat would be 120 minus 90, which equals 30 cars available for rent.\n\nBut the question says \"on average during the day.\" If the rental rate is constant throughout the day, then the average number of cars available would be 30.\n\nHowever, in reality, car rentals might fluctuate during the day as cars are rented out and returned. But since the question states \"at any given time,\" it suggests that the 75% is an average occupancy rate.\n\nTherefore, on average, there would be 30 cars available for rent during the day.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's a different interpretation. Let's think about it differently.\n\nIf 75% of the cars are rented out at any given time, that means that 25% are available for rent, right? Because 100% minus 75% is 25%.\n\nSo, 25% of 120 cars would be available.\n\nLet me calculate 25% of 120.\n\n25% of 120 is 0.25 times 120, which is 30 cars.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think 30 cars is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the number of cars available.\n\nFor example, are there any cars that are out of service for maintenance or other reasons? The question doesn't mention anything like that, so I assume all cars are either rented out or available for rent.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"on average during the day,\" but since the rental rate is given as a constant 75%, the average number of cars available would remain 30.\n\nAlternatively, if the rental rate varies during the day, the average could be different, but with the information provided, I have to assume that the 75% is a constant rate.\n\nTherefore, the average number of cars available for rent during the day is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
