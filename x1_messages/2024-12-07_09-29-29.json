        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a group of people, and their eye colors are divided into three categories: blue, green, and brown. According to the information:\n\n- 25% have blue eyes\n\n- 35% have green eyes\n\n- The rest have brown eyes\n\nAnd we're told that there are 60 people with blue eyes. We need to find out how many people have brown eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these percentages represent. The percentages are parts of the total number of people in the group. So, if 25% have blue eyes, that means that for every 100 people in the group, 25 have blue eyes.\n\nBut we know that actually, there are 60 people with blue eyes. So, I can use this information to find out the total number of people in the group.\n\nLet me denote the total number of people in the group as T.\n\nGiven that 25% of T is equal to 60, I can write this as:\n\n0.25 * T = 60\n\nNow, to find T, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\nT = 60 / 0.25\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n60 divided by 0.25 is the same as 60 multiplied by 4, which is 240.\n\nSo, the total number of people in the group is 240.\n\nNow, we know that 35% have green eyes. So, let's find out how many people that is.\n\n35% of 240 is:\n\n0.35 * 240 = 84\n\nSo, 84 people have green eyes.\n\nWe already know that 60 have blue eyes.\n\nNow, to find out how many have brown eyes, we can subtract the number of people with blue and green eyes from the total.\n\nSo, number of people with brown eyes = T - (number with blue eyes + number with green eyes)\n\nThat is:\n\nNumber of people with brown eyes = 240 - (60 + 84) = 240 - 144 = 96\n\nAlternatively, since the rest have brown eyes, we can calculate the percentage of people with brown eyes.\n\nWe know that 25% have blue eyes and 35% have green eyes, so the percentage with brown eyes is:\n\n100% - 25% - 35% = 40%\n\nSo, 40% of the total have brown eyes.\n\n40% of 240 is:\n\n0.40 * 240 = 96\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of people with brown eyes is 96.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- 25% have blue eyes, which is 60 people.\n\n- So, total people T = 60 / 0.25 = 240\n\n- 35% have green eyes, which is 0.35 * 240 = 84 people\n\n- Brown eyes are the rest: 100% - 25% - 35% = 40%\n\n- So, 40% of 240 is 0.40 * 240 = 96\n\nAlternatively, total people minus blue and green eyes: 240 - (60 + 84) = 240 - 144 = 96\n\nBoth methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that 96 is the correct number of people with brown eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
