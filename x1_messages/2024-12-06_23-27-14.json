And in honor of that occasion, I want to invite all the hard working women on my crew to join me on camera for a little face time. Come on, ladies, it`s your moment. Yes. Bobby, actual women. Not you. You look like Linda Tripp. Stop it. Some people will do anything to get on television. Get, get. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Coming up on THE JOY BEHAR SHOW, Charlie Sheen`s crazy reaction after being fired by Warner brothers. The troubled star takes to the roof of an office building with a machete and a bottle of something he calls tiger`s blood. Then Hollywood icon, Joan Rivers joins Joy to talk about designer John Galliano`s anti-Semitic meltdown and her own reality show with daughter, Melissa. And one man, four wives and 16 children. The stars of the show, \"The Sister Wives\", tell Joy about their unique lifestyle and their struggle to protect it. That and more starting right now. BEHAR: After getting fired from his job yesterday, Charlie Sheen celebrated by climbing a rooftop in Los Angeles with a machete in one hand and a bottle of so-called tiger blood in the other. Watch the video from TMZ. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you excited about the prospects now that you`re done with \"Two and a Half Men\"? CHARLIE SHEEN, ACTOR: I`ve been saying free at last. BEHAR: Ok. He then went on to broadcast an eerie Internet video on Ustream. Here now with his take on all of this is Dr. Drew Pinsky, addiction specialist and the host of the Nightly HLN show, \"Dr. Drew\" premiering right here on HLN, April 4th. Welcome back to my show, Dr. Drew. I`m happy to see you and you`re part of the family now. It`s great. Do you love it? DR. DREW PINSKY, ADDICTION SPECIALIST: Thank you Joy. I appreciate it. That`s very kind of you. BEHAR: Ok. PINSKY: I do love it actually. Thank you. BEHAR: So, you saw some of this. And there`s this crazy stream that he did where he`s basically, his hair is wild. I mean is this Sheen going over the edge? Is that what we`re watching? PINSKY: Well, yes, it`s funny to me that people somehow believe that you have to know a patient intimately to understand they have a medical condition. It`s really for me, no different than looking at a rash. If somebody who uncharacteristically has a grandiose belief that they have special powers, there`s a torrent of speech, there`s distractibility, flight of ideas, seemingly endless energy, hyper-sexuality -- those are all criteria for a condition called hypomania. It simply defines what hypomania is. The other thing is for my patients that are similar to that that get into a hypomanic state, they typically don`t do drugs then. That`s when they don`t want to do drugs because they feel high all the time. So all this consternation about is Charlie on drugs, isn`t he, is completely meaningless. All we can see here is that he`s in a hypomanic. He`s known to be a drug addict, I mean there`s no doubt that. He`s been treated multiple times. But the issue that`s driving him right now is a psychiatric condition called hypomania that can be induced by drugs and alcohol. BEHAR: I see. So it`s even worse than PINSKY: No, it`s hypo meaning just under mania is when they get to mania is when they lose touch with reality completely. And hypomania typically don`t stay the same. They flip over into a mania or they start coming down on the other side and that`s when they start using drugs and alcohol again. BEHAR: I see. That`s interesting. What do you make of the fact that he`s carrying a machete? I mean he`s always saying he wants to love violently. He uses the word \"violent\", a lot. Love violently, first of all, is an oxymoron. So, what is that about? PINSKY: Yes. Well, there`s a lot of aggression and irritability oftentimes when they`re in a hypomanic state. What`s different about hypomanics is their view of the world begs no alternative. They believe they have a special understanding and special powers. And they don`t believe they need treatment. None of them -- it`s rare that a hypomanic comes in and says, \"Hey, I want help with this.\" It`s their employer that brings them in, their family brings them in because they become aggressive, and violent, erratic, and unpredictable. BEHAR: You know a lot of people are finding fault with the media and the public for egging him on, but it`s really very difficult to turn away from a guy who`s acting like this. Who do you think should bear some of the blame for the media attention that he`s getting? Is it really the media? PINSKY: Well, it`s disturbing to me to see his story juxtaposed with the story of Libya, say. I mean it`s problematic, let`s face. But the fact is, it is infectious. It is interesting. It`s natural to be curious about this stuff. What`s disturbing for me when I watch it is the people that are actually are around him. The sycophants around him who are co-signing and accelerating and actually egging him on rather than containing him and getting him to proper care. These are the people that when things go bad, should be held accountable because it`s not going to go well. It`s not going to go well. BEHAR: No. So what do you think -- what`s going to be the end for this guy? Is this going to continue on television do you think, or no? PINSKY: He looks like he`s heading a little towards more -- towards mania right now. And boy, if he does, you`re going to hear about the police coming out frequently. You`re going to hear about violent behaviors. You`re going to hear about drug arrests. That`s just where this kind of goes. It tends not to get better by itself. BEHAR: Ok. All right. Thanks very much, Drew. PINSKY: It`s very sad. It`s very difficult. BEHAR: It is a little. PINSKY: Thank you Joy. BEHAR: Thank you very much. And remember, Dr. Drew`s nightly show premieres April 4th on HLN. Now, I want to bring in my friends, Joan and Melissa Rivers, co-stars of \"Joan and Melissa, Joan Knows Best?\" -- with a question mark. The season finale airs March 15th at 9:00 p.m. on WE. Welcome to the show , my dears. JOAN RIVERS, COMEDIAN: Glad to see you again. MELISSA RIVERS, DAUGHTER OF JOAN RIVERS: HI. BEHAR: So nice to see you both. Now, we were just talking to Charlie, as you know. He`s on the roof with a machete. What do you make of this? J. RIVERS: What do I make of this. BEHAR: Is he crazy? Is he bipolar? Is he going to jump? What? M. RIVERS: I`m actually just happen to be reading a book, where they talk about hypomania today and I love Dr. Drew. I`ve known him forever. Whatever he says is right. As far as I`m concerned, yes, that would be a good diagnosis. But I have to tell you, Charlie`s very smart, very funny and I think at this point, he`s amusing himself. And if the guy thinks -- he used the word umbrage on TV and correctly. Who uses umbrage anymore and what`s that? J. RIVERS: I think he`s very BEHAR: He`s a ratings magnet. Let him move in with you and Melissa. J. RIVERS: Is that the movie, \"Inception\", you don`t know what the hell is going on, but you`re waiting for the end. M. RIVERS: This is the best entertainment and he`s smarter than all of us combined or it`s the biggest meltdown since Chernobyl. It`s one of the two. BEHAR: But I mean is he going to kill -- is Chuck Lorre going to kill him? That`s what I want to know. That`s an interesting dynamic. M. RIVERS: That`s a very volatile dynamic. And the more that comes out, you realize there was so much tension behind the scenes. BEHAR: Why would that guy go on television with those vanity cards and talk about his show? He`s a producer, get it off the screen J. RIVERS: Oh, everybody wants to be on the screen. Come on. BEHAR: I know that but to do that? I thought it was ridiculous. M. RIVERS: Just when you think it didn`t get any better, this story, it always does. With Access: Hollywood live, which is actually the day I do Fashion Fridays, that was the day that he announced that he was Jewish. What is that? J. RIVERS: And he was wearing a Galliano jacket. BEHAR: But I mean is he really half Jewish? M. RIVERS: Apparently so. On the mother`s side. BEHAR: And his father`s side is from Spain? M. RIVERS: Yes. Or Puerto Rican. BEHAR: Emilio Estevez and Martin Sheen are Puerto Rican. J. RIVERS: I`ve seen them in the BEHAR: But I mean, do you think he made an anti-Semitic comment when he said Haim Levine or whatever he said? I don`t think so. M. RIVERS: No. J. RIVERS: I do. BEHAR: You do? J. RIVERS: I`m sorry. BEHAR: I mean compared to Mel Gibson and Galliano, with their real anti-Semitism. J. RIVERS: It depends. And he said and my producer, Haim Levine, he was \"Haim\". He did. M. RIVERS: Honestly, I didn`t read it as anti-Semitic and I`m very sensitive to those kind of things because in context I thought it was -- it was actually kind of funny and his reply was, you can also call me Carlos Estevez, which is my real name. And my publicist is Jewish, and my BEHAR: Some of my best friends are Jewish. M. RIVERS: And my ex-wife is Jewish. And my soon-to-be ex-wife is Jewish. BEHAR: The one he held a knife to the throat? M. RIVERS: Yes, her. J. RIVERS: That`s why. BEHAR: They say Jewish girls are smart. Not that smart. J. RIVERS: Smart enough to get a check. M. RIVERS: And she`s not on a reality show. J. RIVERS: Not smart. M. RIVERS: She doesn`t have a Paris Hilton reality show. J. RIVERS: You wouldn`t sleep with a whack-a-doodle for a year and be taking care of the rest of your life, Charlie -- absolutely. BEHAR: But there seems to be a little bit of an uprising in the anti- Semitism. You noticed that? M. RIVERS: Yes. BEHAR: Around the world -- some is in the states, like in the Arab states where they teach you to hate the Jews. But some of them is just like individuals -- M. RIVERS: Yes, me and my relatives. BEHAR: Yes, what`s going on. M. RIVERS: I found John Galliano thing very disturbing. Because that was someone who was being dead serious. BEHAR: Well, he was drunk. Oh, in vino veritas. J. RIVERS: Exactly. When they`re drunk is when the truth comes out. BEHAR: So, it is no excuse for it. J. RIVERS: What`s his name, Mel Gibson? When he`s drunk -- that`s when your guard is down. BEHAR: Exactly. Most people when they`re drunk, just act drunk. The say silly things. They don`t start screaming, \"I hate Jews\" and \"I love Hitler\". What kind of behavior is that. J. RIVERS: Hitler was a great dancer. BEHAR: Yes. That`s true. A snappy dancer. M. RIVERS: I know. BEHAR: Snappy. But you know maybe you could do a reality show with Mel Gibson and John Galliano, Charlie Sheen the three of them. M. RIVERS: That would be brilliant. BEHAR: That would be brilliant. J. RIVERS: You know Dr. Drew right now is dialing and going \"Celebrity Rehab 12\". BEHAR: I love it. M. RIVERS: That you know. BEHAR: Ok, next. Will the Donald run for president and wouldn`t it be great to hear him tell Gadhafi, you`re fired? We`ll be right back. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Coming up later, one man, four wives. The very big family from the reality show \"Sister Wives\" tells Joy how they make it work.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
