        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. There's a book with 1000 pages, and it weighs 500 grams. After reading, I tear out all the read pages, and the book weighs 300 grams. I need to figure out how many pages I read.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how much each page weighs. If the whole book has 1000 pages and weighs 500 grams, then each page weighs 500 grams divided by 1000 pages, which is 0.5 grams per page.\n\nNow, after reading some pages and tearing them out, the book weighs 300 grams. So, the weight of the pages I tore out must be the difference between the original weight and the current weight. That would be 500 grams minus 300 grams, which is 200 grams.\n\nSince each page weighs 0.5 grams, the number of pages I read and tore out would be 200 grams divided by 0.5 grams per page. Let's do that calculation: 200 divided by 0.5 is 400 pages.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. Original weight: 500 grams. Weight after tearing out pages: 300 grams. So, the pages I tore out weigh 200 grams. Each page weighs 0.5 grams, so 200 grams divided by 0.5 grams per page should indeed be 400 pages.\n\nBut, let's consider if there's anything else I might be missing. Is there any other weight in the book besides the pages? Like, maybe the cover or something. The problem doesn't mention any other components, so I'll assume that the entire weight is from the pages.\n\nAlso, I'm assuming that each page weighs the same, which seems reasonable. So, based on that, 400 pages weigh 200 grams, and that matches the weight difference.\n\nTherefore, the number of pages I read is 400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
