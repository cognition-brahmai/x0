        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The length is 20 meters and the width is 12 meters, and I need to find out the perimeter in meters. Alright, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that a rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So, the perimeter should be the total distance around the garden. That means I need to add up all the sides.\n\nSo, if the length is 20 meters, then there are two sides that are each 20 meters long. So, 2 times 20 meters should give me the total length of those two sides. Let me do that: 2 times 20 is 40 meters.\n\nNext, the width is 12 meters, and there are also two sides of that width. So, 2 times 12 meters should give me the total length of those two sides. 2 times 12 is 24 meters.\n\nNow, to get the total perimeter, I need to add those two results together: 40 meters plus 24 meters. That should be 64 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle that I can recall? I think there is. The formula should be P equals 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, or maybe P equals 2 times the sum of the length and the width. Let me think.\n\nOh, yes, I remember now. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P equals 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, which can also be written as P equals 2 times (length plus width). So, let me check if I get the same answer using the formula.\n\nUsing the formula, P equals 2 times (20 meters plus 12 meters). First, add the length and the width: 20 plus 12 is 32 meters. Then, multiply by 2: 2 times 32 is 64 meters. Okay, that matches what I calculated earlier by adding the sides separately.\n\nJust to be thorough, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of perimeter for any polygon, which is just the sum of all its sides. So, for a rectangle, which has four sides, two of length 20 meters and two of 12 meters, adding them up: 20 plus 20 plus 12 plus 12. That's 40 plus 24, which again is 64 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to walk around the garden, starting from one corner. I'd walk 20 meters along the length, then 12 meters along the width, then another 20 meters along the length, and finally 12 meters along the width to get back to the starting point. Adding those up: 20 plus 12 plus 20 plus 12, which is again 64 meters.\n\nHmm, I'm getting consistent answers with different methods, which makes me confident that 64 meters is the correct perimeter of the garden.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is the garden on an incline or something? No, it's just a rectangular garden with given length and width. No other details are provided, so I don't think there are any tricks here.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correct. The length and width are both given in meters, and the perimeter is also in meters, which makes sense.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that the garden is a square? No, because the length and width are different: 20 meters and 12 meters respectively. So, it's definitely a rectangle.\n\nAnother thing to consider: is the perimeter asking for the total boundary length? Yes, that's what perimeter means. It's not asking for area or anything else.\n\nJust to double-check my calculations: 2 times 20 is 40, 2 times 12 is 24, and 40 plus 24 is 64. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula P equals 2 times (length plus width): 2 times (20 plus 12) is 2 times 32, which is 64 meters. Same answer.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with this answer. The perimeter of the garden is 64 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
