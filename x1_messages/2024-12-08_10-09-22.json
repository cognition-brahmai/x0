        "content": "So I've got this question here: If a bacteria population doubles every 20 minutes, how many bacteria will there be after 2 hours starting with a single bacterium?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a bacteria population that doubles every 20 minutes, and we want to know how many bacteria there will be after 2 hours, starting from just one bacterium.\n\nOkay, so doubling every 20 minutes means that every 20 minutes, the number of bacteria becomes twice what it was. So, if we start with 1 bacterium, after 20 minutes, it becomes 2, then after another 20 minutes (so 40 minutes total), it becomes 4, and so on.\n\nNow, 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, right? Because 60 minutes in an hour times 2 equals 120 minutes.\n\nSo, if the bacteria double every 20 minutes, I need to find out how many 20-minute intervals there are in 120 minutes. That should tell me how many times the population doubles.\n\nLet's calculate that: 120 minutes divided by 20 minutes per doubling equals 6. So, the population doubles 6 times in 2 hours.\n\nStarting with 1 bacterium, after each doubling, the number of bacteria is multiplied by 2. So, after 1 doubling, it's 1 * 2 = 2 bacteria. After 2 doublings, it's 2 * 2 = 4 bacteria. After 3 doublings, it's 4 * 2 = 8 bacteria, and so on.\n\nSo, after 6 doublings, it would be 1 * 2^6.\n\nWait, actually, let's think about that. If we double once, it's 2^1 = 2. Double twice, it's 2^2 = 4. Triple, it's 2^3 = 8. So, after 6 doublings, it should be 2^6.\n\n2^6 is 64.\n\nSo, starting with 1 bacterium, after 6 doublings, there would be 64 bacteria.\n\nBut, let me double-check that. Maybe I should think about it step by step.\n\nStart: 1 bacterium\n\nAfter 20 minutes: 1 * 2 = 2 bacteria\n\nAfter 40 minutes: 2 * 2 = 4 bacteria\n\nAfter 60 minutes: 4 * 2 = 8 bacteria\n\nAfter 80 minutes: 8 * 2 = 16 bacteria\n\nAfter 100 minutes: 16 * 2 = 32 bacteria\n\nAfter 120 minutes: 32 * 2 = 64 bacteria\n\nOkay, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for exponential growth. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\nN = N0 * 2^(t/T)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the final number of bacteria\n\n- N0 is the initial number of bacteria\n\n- t is the time elapsed\n\n- T is the doubling time\n\nIn this case, N0 = 1, t = 120 minutes, and T = 20 minutes.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nN = 1 * 2^(120/20) = 2^(6) = 64\n\nAgain, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait a minute, but exponential growth can also be expressed using e, the base of the natural logarithm. Is there another way to approach this?\n\nYes, the general exponential growth formula is also:\n\nN = N0 * e^(kt)\n\nWhere k is the growth rate.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with doubling time, the first formula is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the growth rate k from the doubling time.\n\nThe doubling time T is related to k by:\n\nT = ln(2)/k\n\nSo, k = ln(2)/T\n\nGiven T = 20 minutes, k = ln(2)/20\n\nThen, N = N0 * e^(kt)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nN = 1 * e^((ln(2)/20)*120) = e^( (ln(2)*120)/20 ) = e^( (ln(2)*6) ) = e^(ln(2^6)) = 2^6 = 64\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. Maybe using a table to see the growth at each interval.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\nTime (min): Bacteria\n\n0: 1\n\n20: 2\n\n40: 4\n\n60: 8\n\n80: 16\n\n100: 32\n\n120: 64\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the population grows exponentially, the number of bacteria at any time is the initial amount multiplied by 2 raised to the number of doubling periods.\n\nWhich is what we did.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 64 bacteria after 2 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any possibility that the doubling time changes over time? The question says the population doubles every 20 minutes, so presumable it's constant.\n\nIs there any limitation in resources or space that might affect the growth? The question doesn't mention any constraints, so we can assume unlimited resources.\n\nIs there any mortality or other factors affecting the population? Again, the question is simple and doesn't mention any deaths, so we can assume the population only grows by doubling.\n\nTherefore, the calculation should hold.\n\nSo, starting with 1 bacterium, after 2 hours, there will be 64 bacteria.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
