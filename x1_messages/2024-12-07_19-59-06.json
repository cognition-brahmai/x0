        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Merge sort is a powerful sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It's especially useful for large datasets because it's efficient and stable.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:\n\n1. **Divide**: If the array has more than one element, divide it into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted array.\n\nNow, let's translate this into JavaScript code. I'll write a function called `mergeSort` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array that's sorted in ascending order.\n\nFirst, we need a helper function to merge two sorted arrays. Let's call it `merge`. This function will take two sorted arrays and return a single sorted array that contains all elements from both input arrays.\n\nHere's how the `merge` function works:\n\n- Initialize two pointers, one for each array, starting at the first element.\n- Compare the elements at the current pointers and add the smaller one to the result array.\n- Move the pointer of the array from which the smaller element was taken.\n- Repeat this process until all elements from both arrays are merged into the result array.\n\nNow, for the `mergeSort` function:\n\n- If the array has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so return it as is.\n- Otherwise, find the middle index of the array and divide it into two halves.\n- Recursively call `mergeSort` on both halves.\n- Use the `merge` function to combine the two sorted halves.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement the merge sort algorithm in JavaScript, we need to create two functions: `merge` and `mergeSort`. The `merge` function will combine two sorted arrays into one sorted array, and the `mergeSort` function will recursively divide and sort the array.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted halves back into a single sorted array.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(left, right) {\n    let result = [];\n    let leftIndex = 0;\n    let rightIndex = 0;\n\n    while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {\n        if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {\n            result.push(left[leftIndex]);\n            leftIndex++;\n        } else {\n            result.push(right[rightIndex]);\n            rightIndex++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Concatenate any remaining elements from the left or right array\n    return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));\n}\n\nfunction mergeSort(arr) {\n    if (arr.length <= 1) {\n        return arr;\n    }\n\n    // Find the middle index of the array\n    const middle = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);\n    const leftHalf = arr.slice(0, middle);\n    const rightHalf = arr.slice(middle);\n\n    // Recursively sort both halves\n    const sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);\n    const sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);\n\n    // Merge the sorted halves\n    return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **merge Function**:\n    - Merges two sorted arrays (`left` and `right`) into a single sorted array.\n    - Uses two pointers to traverse the arrays and compares elements to decide the order.\n    - Concatenates any remaining elements from either array after the loop.\n\n2. **mergeSort Function**:\n    - Base case: If the array has one or zero elements, it is already sorted.\n    - Recursive case:\n        - Splits the array into two halves.\n        - Recursively sorts each half.\n        - Merges the two sorted halves using the `merge` function.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted efficiently using the merge sort algorithm."
