        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory produces 1200 units of product A every day. That seems straightforward. Now, it also produces 3 times as many units of product B as it does of product A. So, if product A is 1200 units per day, then product B should be 3 times that, right?\n\nLet me calculate that. 3 times 1200 is 3600 units of product B per day. So, altogether, in one day, the factory produces product A and product B, which is 1200 plus 3600 units.\n\nLet's add those up: 1200 + 3600 equals 4800 units per day. Now, the question is asking for the total units produced in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so I need to multiply the daily production by 7.\n\nSo, 4800 units per day times 7 days equals... let's see, 4800 times 7.\n\nI can calculate this as (4000 times 7) plus (800 times 7). That would be 28,000 plus 5,600, which totals 33,600 units per week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, daily production of product A: 1200 units.\n\nDaily production of product B: 3 times A, so 3 * 1200 = 3600 units.\n\nTotal daily production: 1200 + 3600 = 4800 units.\n\nWeekly production: 4800 units/day * 7 days/week = 33,600 units/week.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the factory produces a total of 33,600 units in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33600} \\]"
