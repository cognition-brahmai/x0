The full quote is: \"In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.\" It emphasizes that sometimes, the most hurtful thing isn't the criticism or hostility from those who oppose us, but the failure of those who claim to be our allies to stand with us when it matters most."
