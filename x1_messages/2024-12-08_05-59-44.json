The expression given is:\n\n4 * (6 - 2) / 2 + 3^2\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with parentheses:\n\n6 - 2 = 4\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n4 * 4 / 2 + 3^2\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n4 * 4 / 2 + 9\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\nFirst, 4 * 4 = 16\n\nThen, 16 / 2 = 8\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n8 + 9\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n8 + 9 = 17\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
