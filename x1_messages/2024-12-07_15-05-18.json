        "content": "Let's see. I have this store that offers discounts for buying more items at once. The discounts are based on how many items you purchase:\n\n- If you buy 2 items, you get a 10% discount.\n\n- If you buy 3 items, you get a 20% discount.\n\n- If you buy 4 or more items, you get a 30% discount.\n\nEach item costs $50. I need to find out how much I would save by purchasing 5 items instead of just 1.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total cost without any discounts. If I buy 1 item, it's straightforward: 1 \u00d7 $50 = $50.\n\nNow, if I buy 5 items without any discount, it would be 5 \u00d7 $50 = $250.\n\nBut since the store offers a 30% discount for buying 4 or more items, I can apply that discount to the 5 items.\n\nSo, the discount is 30% on the total price of 5 items.\n\nLet me calculate the discount amount: 30% of $250.\n\nTo find 30% of $250, I can multiply 250 by 0.30.\n\n$250 \u00d7 0.30 = $75.\n\nSo, the discount is $75.\n\nTherefore, the total cost after discount for 5 items is $250 - $75 = $175.\n\nNow, to find out how much I save by purchasing 5 items instead of 1, I need to compare the cost of buying 5 items with discount to the cost of buying 1 item without discount.\n\nWait, but the question might be asking about the savings relative to buying 1 item at a time without any discount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking how much I save per item by buying 5 together compared to buying 1 at a time.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I buy 1 item, it costs $50.\n\nIf I buy 5 items with the discount, it costs $175.\n\nSo, the cost per item when buying 5 is $175 / 5 = $35 per item.\n\nTherefore, I save $50 - $35 = $15 per item.\n\nSince I'm buying 5 items, the total savings would be 5 \u00d7 $15 = $75.\n\nWait, that's the same as the discount amount.\n\nSo, by purchasing 5 items instead of 1, I save $75.\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nIf I buy 1 item, it costs $50.\n\nIf I buy 5 items with 30% discount, it costs $175.\n\nSo, the total savings is $250 - $175 = $75.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to buy 5 items individually, it would cost 5 \u00d7 $50 = $250.\n\nBut with the discount, I pay $175.\n\nTherefore, I save $250 - $175 = $75.\n\nAlternatively, since the discount is applied to the total price, and it's 30%, which is $75, that matches.\n\nSo, the amount saved by purchasing 5 items instead of 1 is $75.\n\nWait a minute, but if I compare buying 5 items with discount to buying 1 item, it seems like I'm saving $75 in total.\n\nBut perhaps another way to look at it is the savings per item, which is $15 per item, and for 5 items, it's $75.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
