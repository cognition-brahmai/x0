The developer is concerned about potential increases in the LIBOR rate, which could increase the cost of the loan. To mitigate this risk, the developer enters into an interest rate swap agreement, exchanging the variable rate for a fixed rate. Based on this scenario, what is the primary purpose of the interest rate swap for the developer?\nA. To secure a lower interest rate\nB. To hedge against interest rate risk\nC.

        "content": "The primary purpose of the interest rate swap for the developer is to hedge against interest rate risk. By entering into an interest rate swap agreement, the developer exchanges the variable interest rate tied to the LIBOR rate for a fixed interest rate. This means that instead of facing potential increases in the LIBOR rate, which could lead to higher interest payments, the developer will pay a predetermined, fixed interest rate throughout the term of the swap agreement.\n\nThis strategy helps the developer to better manage and predict their future interest expenses, providing financial stability and reducing the uncertainty associated with fluctuating interest rates. Therefore, the correct answer is B. To hedge against interest rate risk.\n\nOption A, to secure a lower interest rate, might be a secondary benefit if the fixed rate is lower than the current variable rate, but the primary purpose is risk management, not necessarily to get a lower rate.\n\nOption C, to extend the term of the loan, is not addressed by an interest rate swap. Swaps typically have their own tenor and do not directly affect the term of the underlying loan.\n\nOption D, to reduce the principal amount of the loan, is also not a function of an interest rate swap. Swaps involve exchanging cash flows based on different interest rate calculations but do not alter the principal amount of the loan."
