        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If a car's wheels have a diameter of 60 cm, how many times will the wheels rotate when the car travels 1 kilometer? Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the wheel's rotation and the distance the car travels. I think it has something to do with the circumference of the wheel. The circumference is the distance around the wheel, and every full rotation of the wheel covers a distance equal to its circumference.\n\nSo, the formula for the circumference (C) of a circle is C = \u03c0 * d, where d is the diameter. Given that the diameter (d) is 60 cm, I can plug that into the formula.\n\nC = \u03c0 * 60 cm\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that all units are consistent. The distance traveled is given in kilometers, and the diameter is in centimeters. I need to convert everything to the same unit. Let's convert kilometers to centimeters.\n\n1 kilometer = 1000 meters = 100,000 centimeters.\n\nSo, the car travels 100,000 cm.\n\nNow, the circumference is C = \u03c0 * 60 cm \u2248 3.1416 * 60 cm = 188.496 cm.\n\nTo find out how many rotations the wheel makes, I need to divide the total distance traveled by the circumference of the wheel.\n\nNumber of rotations = Total distance / Circumference\n\nNumber of rotations = 100,000 cm / 188.496 cm \u2248 530.52\n\nBut since a wheel can't rotate a fraction of a time in practical terms, I'll round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, the wheel rotates approximately 531 times when the car travels 1 kilometer.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a more precise way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of rotations = (Distance traveled) / (\u03c0 * d)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNumber of rotations = 100,000 cm / (3.1416 * 60 cm) \u2248 100,000 / 188.496 \u2248 530.52\n\nAgain, that's approximately 531 rotations.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula involving the wheel's radius. The radius (r) is half of the diameter, so r = 30 cm.\n\nThe circumference can also be calculated as C = 2 * \u03c0 * r = 2 * 3.1416 * 30 cm = 188.496 cm, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with approximately 531 rotations.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like wheel slippage or something. But the problem doesn't mention any friction issues or slippage, so I think assuming perfect rolling is fine.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct value of \u03c0. Typically, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, but for more precision, I could use more decimal places. However, given that the diameter is provided to two significant figures (60 cm), using a more precise value of \u03c0 might be unnecessary.\n\nLet me try using \u03c0 as 3.14 to see if it makes a difference.\n\nC = 3.14 * 60 cm = 188.4 cm\n\nNumber of rotations = 100,000 cm / 188.4 cm \u2248 531.04\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, it's still 531 rotations.\n\nAlright, I think I can confidently say that the wheel rotates approximately 531 times when the car travels 1 kilometer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider the units again. If the diameter was meant to be 60 cm, and the distance is 1 kilometer, which is 100,000 cm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the diameter was meant to be 60 cm, but perhaps it's meant to be 60 inches or something else. But the problem specifies centimeters, so I'll stick with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the wheel's rotation might be affected by the car's gear ratio or something, but since this is a straightforward physics or math problem, I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the wheel rotates approximately 531 times when the car travels 1 kilometer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{531} \\]"
