        "content": "So the car rental company wants to improve its overall fleet fuel efficiency by 10%. They have different types of vehicles: compact cars, midsize sedans, and SUVs, each with their own average miles per gallon (mpg). The company wants to know how many of each type they should replace with more fuel-efficient models to achieve this 10% improvement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current overall fuel efficiency of the fleet is. To do that, I'll calculate the weighted average mpg based on the number of each type of vehicle and their respective mpg.\n\nHere's the current fleet:\n\n- Compact cars: 100 vehicles, 35 mpg\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50 vehicles, 28 mpg\n\n- SUVs: 25 vehicles, 22 mpg\n\nTotal number of vehicles = 100 + 50 + 25 = 175 vehicles\n\nNow, calculate the current overall mpg:\n\nOverall mpg = (Total miles driven) / (Total gallons used)\n\nTo find the total miles driven, I'll assume each vehicle drives the same distance, say X miles. So, total miles driven = (100 * X) + (50 * X) + (25 * X) = 175X miles\n\nTotal gallons used:\n\n- Compact cars: (100 * X) / 35\n\n- Midsize sedans: (50 * X) / 28\n\n- SUVs: (25 * X) / 22\n\nSo, total gallons used = (100X / 35) + (50X / 28) + (25X / 22)\n\nTherefore, overall mpg = 175X / [(100X / 35) + (50X / 28) + (25X / 22)]\n\nThe X cancels out:\n\nOverall mpg = 175 / (100/35 + 50/28 + 25/22)\n\nNow, calculate the denominators:\n\n100 / 35 \u2248 2.857\n\n50 / 28 \u2248 1.786\n\n25 / 22 \u2248 1.136\n\nSum = 2.857 + 1.786 + 1.136 \u2248 5.779\n\nSo, overall mpg = 175 / 5.779 \u2248 30.28 mpg\n\nThe company wants to improve this by 10%, so the target overall mpg is:\n\n30.28 * 1.10 \u2248 33.31 mpg\n\nNow, the company needs to replace some vehicles with more fuel-efficient models to achieve this target. But the problem doesn't specify what the mpg of the new vehicles would be. For the sake of this problem, let's assume that the new vehicles are hybrids with an mpg of 45 mpg. This is a common mpg for many hybrid vehicles.\n\nSo, we're replacing some compact cars, midsize sedans, and SUVs with hybrids that get 45 mpg. We need to determine how many of each type to replace to reach the overall mpg of 33.31.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let C be the number of compact cars replaced\n\n- Let M be the number of midsize sedans replaced\n\n- Let S be the number of SUVs replaced\n\nAll replaced vehicles will be hybrids with 45 mpg.\n\nThe new fleet will have:\n\n- Compact cars: 100 - C\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50 - M\n\n- SUVs: 25 - S\n\n- Hybrids: C + M + S\n\nNow, calculate the new overall mpg:\n\nTotal miles driven remains 175X\n\nTotal gallons used:\n\n- Compact cars: [(100 - C) * X] / 35\n\n- Midsize sedans: [(50 - M) * X] / 28\n\n- SUVs: [(25 - S) * X] / 22\n\n- Hybrids: [(C + M + S) * X] / 45\n\nSo, total gallons used = [(100 - C)X / 35] + [(50 - M)X / 28] + [(25 - S)X / 22] + [(C + M + S)X / 45]\n\nOverall mpg = 175X / [((100 - C)/35 + (50 - M)/28 + (25 - S)/22 + (C + M + S)/45) * X]\n\nAgain, X cancels out:\n\nOverall mpg = 175 / ((100 - C)/35 + (50 - M)/28 + (25 - S)/22 + (C + M + S)/45)\n\nWe want this to be equal to 33.31:\n\n175 / ((100 - C)/35 + (50 - M)/28 + (25 - S)/22 + (C + M + S)/45) = 33.31\n\nLet\u2019s set this up as an equation:\n\n175 / (A + B + C + D) = 33.31\n\nWhere:\n\nA = (100 - C)/35\n\nB = (50 - M)/28\n\nC = (25 - S)/22\n\nD = (C + M + S)/45\n\nSo,\n\nA + B + C + D = 175 / 33.31 \u2248 5.253\n\nWait, actually, 175 / 33.31 \u2248 5.253, but earlier we had 175 / 5.779 = 30.28, and we want 175 / (new sum) = 33.31, so new sum should be 175 / 33.31 \u2248 5.253\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(100 - C)/35 + (50 - M)/28 + (25 - S)/22 + (C + M + S)/45 = 5.253\n\nThis is one equation with three variables (C, M, S). To solve this, we need to make some assumptions or set some constraints because it's an underdetermined system.\n\nOne approach is to assume that the company wants to replace a certain proportion of each type of vehicle. For example, they might want to replace the same percentage of each type or prioritize replacing the least efficient vehicles first.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider minimizing the number of replacements or minimizing the cost, but since cost isn't specified, I'll proceed with the first approach: replacing a proportional number of each type.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the company replaces a proportion P of each type of vehicle.\n\nSo, C = P * 100\n\nM = P * 50\n\nS = P * 25\n\nThen, C + M + S = P * (100 + 50 + 25) = P * 175\n\nNow, substitute back into the equation:\n\n(100 - P*100)/35 + (50 - P*50)/28 + (25 - P*25)/22 + (P*175)/45 = 5.253\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(100(1 - P))/35 + (50(1 - P))/28 + (25(1 - P))/22 + (175P)/45 = 5.253\n\nFactor out (1 - P):\n\n100/35 * (1 - P) + 50/28 * (1 - P) + 25/22 * (1 - P) + 175/45 * P = 5.253\n\nCalculate the coefficients:\n\n100/35 \u2248 2.857\n\n50/28 \u2248 1.786\n\n25/22 \u2248 1.136\n\n175/45 \u2248 3.889\n\nSo,\n\n2.857*(1 - P) + 1.786*(1 - P) + 1.136*(1 - P) + 3.889*P = 5.253\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2.857 + 1.786 + 1.136)*(1 - P) + 3.889*P = 5.253\n\nCalculate the sum:\n\n2.857 + 1.786 + 1.136 \u2248 5.779\n\nSo,\n\n5.779*(1 - P) + 3.889*P = 5.253\n\nExpand:\n\n5.779 - 5.779*P + 3.889*P = 5.253\n\nCombine P terms:\n\n5.779 - (5.779 - 3.889)*P = 5.253\n\n5.779 - 1.89*P = 5.253\n\nNow, solve for P:\n\n5.779 - 5.253 = 1.89*P\n\n0.526 = 1.89*P\n\nP = 0.526 / 1.89 \u2248 0.278\n\nSo, P \u2248 0.278 or 27.8%\n\nTherefore, the company should replace approximately 27.8% of each type of vehicle with hybrids.\n\nNow, calculate the number of vehicles to replace:\n\n- Compact cars: 100 * 0.278 \u2248 28 vehicles\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50 * 0.278 \u2248 14 vehicles\n\n- SUVs: 25 * 0.278 \u2248 7 vehicles\n\nTotal hybrids to add: 28 + 14 + 7 = 49 vehicles\n\nLet\u2019s verify if this achieves the target overall mpg.\n\nNew fleet:\n\n- Compact cars: 100 - 28 = 72\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50 - 14 = 36\n\n- SUVs: 25 - 7 = 18\n\n- Hybrids: 49\n\nCalculate the new overall mpg:\n\nTotal gallons used:\n\n- Compact cars: (72 * X) / 35\n\n- Midsize sedans: (36 * X) / 28\n\n- SUVs: (18 * X) / 22\n\n- Hybrids: (49 * X) / 45\n\nSum of gallons:\n\n(72/35 + 36/28 + 18/22 + 49/45) * X\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n72/35 \u2248 2.057\n\n36/28 \u2248 1.286\n\n18/22 \u2248 0.818\n\n49/45 \u2248 1.089\n\nSum \u2248 2.057 + 1.286 + 0.818 + 1.089 \u2248 5.250\n\nOverall mpg = 175X / (5.250X) \u2248 175 / 5.250 \u2248 33.33 mpg\n\nThis matches the target of 33.31 mpg.\n\nTherefore, replacing approximately 28 compact cars, 14 midsize sedans, and 7 SUVs with hybrids would achieve the desired 10% improvement in overall fleet fuel efficiency.\n\nHowever, the company might want to consider other factors, such as the cost of replacing vehicles, the availability of hybrid models, and customer preferences. Also, this assumption of replacing a proportional number of each type of vehicle may not be the most cost-effective approach. For instance, replacing fewer compact cars (which are already relatively efficient) and more SUVs (which are less efficient) might achieve the same overall mpg with fewer replacements.\n\nAlternatively, the company could prioritize replacing the least efficient vehicles first.\n\nLet\u2019s explore another approach: replacing only the SUVs and midsize sedans, as they are less efficient than the compact cars.\n\nSuppose the company replaces all 25 SUVs and some midsize sedans with hybrids.\n\nLet\u2019s say they replace all 25 SUVs and M midsize sedans with hybrids.\n\nThen:\n\n- Compact cars: 100\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50 - M\n\n- Hybrids: 25 + M\n\nCalculate the overall mpg:\n\nTotal gallons used:\n\n- Compact cars: (100 * X) / 35\n\n- Midsize sedans: ((50 - M) * X) / 28\n\n- Hybrids: ((25 + M) * X) / 45\n\nSum of gallons:\n\n(100/35 + (50 - M)/28 + (25 + M)/45) * X\n\nSet overall mpg to 33.31:\n\n175X / [(100/35 + (50 - M)/28 + (25 + M)/45) * X] = 33.31\n\nSimplify:\n\n175 / (100/35 + (50 - M)/28 + (25 + M)/45) = 33.31\n\nCalculate the denominators:\n\n100/35 \u2248 2.857\n\n(50 - M)/28\n\n(25 + M)/45\n\nSet the equation:\n\n2.857 + (50 - M)/28 + (25 + M)/45 = 175 / 33.31 \u2248 5.253\n\nSo,\n\n(50 - M)/28 + (25 + M)/45 = 5.253 - 2.857 \u2248 2.396\n\nNow, solve for M.\n\nLet\u2019s find a common denominator for 28 and 45, which is 1260.\n\nConvert the fractions:\n\n(50 - M)/28 = [1260*(50 - M)] / (28*1260) = (1260*(50 - M)) / 35280\n\n(25 + M)/45 = [1260*(25 + M)] / (45*1260) = (1260*(25 + M)) / 56700\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to convert to decimals.\n\nCalculate (50 - M)/28 and (25 + M)/45.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nA = (50 - M)/28\n\nB = (25 + M)/45\n\nSo, A + B = 2.396\n\nWe have two variables (A and B) and one equation, which isn't solvable without another equation. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach of replacing a proportional number of each type of vehicle.\n\nAlternatively, the company could consider replacing only the SUVs and midsize sedans, as they are less efficient, but based on the earlier calculation, replacing a combination of compact cars, midsize sedans, and SUVs in proportion seems to be the way to go.\n\nAnother consideration is the cost of replacement. If hybrids are more expensive, the company might want to minimize the number of replacements needed. In that case, replacing the least efficient vehicles first would be more cost-effective.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that.\n\nPrioritizing replacement of the least efficient vehicles first.\n\nThe SUVs are the least efficient, followed by midsize sedans, and then compact cars.\n\nSo, start by replacing SUVs with hybrids.\n\nCalculate how many SUVs need to be replaced to reach the target mpg.\n\nAssume all SUVs replaced with hybrids.\n\nThen:\n\n- Compact cars: 100\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50\n\n- Hybrids: 25 (replaced SUVs)\n\nCalculate overall mpg:\n\nTotal gallons used:\n\n- Compact cars: 100X / 35\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50X / 28\n\n- Hybrids: 25X / 45\n\nSum = (100/35 + 50/28 + 25/45) * X = (2.857 + 1.786 + 0.556) * X \u2248 5.199X\n\nOverall mpg = 175X / 5.199X \u2248 33.65 mpg\n\nThis is above the target of 33.31 mpg.\n\nSo, replacing all 25 SUVs with hybrids would achieve the goal.\n\nBut perhaps the company can replace fewer SUVs and still meet the target.\n\nLet\u2019s find the minimum number of SUVs to replace.\n\nLet S be the number of SUVs replaced with hybrids.\n\nThen:\n\n- Compact cars: 100\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50\n\n- Hybrids: S\n\n- SUVs: 25 - S\n\nCalculate overall mpg:\n\nTotal gallons used:\n\n- Compact cars: 100X / 35\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50X / 28\n\n- Hybrids: S*X / 45\n\n- SUVs: (25 - S)*X / 22\n\nSum = (100/35 + 50/28 + S/45 + (25 - S)/22) * X\n\nSet overall mpg to 33.31:\n\n175X / [(100/35 + 50/28 + S/45 + (25 - S)/22) * X] = 33.31\n\nSimplify:\n\n175 / (100/35 + 50/28 + S/45 + (25 - S)/22) = 33.31\n\nCalculate the denominators:\n\n100/35 \u2248 2.857\n\n50/28 \u2248 1.786\n\nS/45\n\n(25 - S)/22\n\nSo,\n\n2.857 + 1.786 + S/45 + (25 - S)/22 = 175 / 33.31 \u2248 5.253\n\nCombine constants:\n\n2.857 + 1.786 \u2248 4.643\n\nSo,\n\n4.643 + S/45 + (25 - S)/22 = 5.253\n\nSubtract 4.643 from both sides:\n\nS/45 + (25 - S)/22 = 0.610\n\nTo solve for S, find a common denominator for 45 and 22, which is 990.\n\nConvert fractions:\n\nS/45 = (S * 22) / 990 = 22S / 990\n\n(25 - S)/22 = (25 - S) * 45 / 990 = (1125 - 45S) / 990\n\nSo,\n\n22S / 990 + (1125 - 45S) / 990 = 0.610\n\nCombine numerators:\n\n(22S + 1125 - 45S) / 990 = 0.610\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n-23S + 1125 = 0.610 * 990\n\nCalculate right side:\n\n0.610 * 990 \u2248 603.9\n\nSo,\n\n-23S + 1125 = 603.9\n\nSubtract 1125 from both sides:\n\n-23S = 603.9 - 1125 = -521.1\n\nDivide both sides by -23:\n\nS = 521.1 / 23 \u2248 22.657\n\nSince S must be less than or equal to 25 (the number of SUVs), replacing approximately 23 SUVs with hybrids would achieve the target mpg.\n\nHowever, earlier, replacing all 25 SUVs achieved a higher mpg of 33.65, which is above the target. Replacing fewer SUVs, say 23, would get us closer to the target but might not be precise.\n\nLet\u2019s check with S = 23:\n\nCalculate overall mpg:\n\nTotal gallons used:\n\n- Compact cars: 100X / 35 \u2248 2.857X\n\n- Midsize sedans: 50X / 28 \u2248 1.786X\n\n- Hybrids: 23X / 45 \u2248 0.511X\n\n- SUVs: (25 - 23)X / 22 = 2X / 22 \u2248 0.091X\n\nSum \u2248 2.857 + 1.786 + 0.511 + 0.091 \u2248 5.245X\n\nOverall mpg = 175X / 5.245X \u2248 33.36 mpg\n\nThis is very close to the target of 33.31 mpg.\n\nTherefore, replacing 23 SUVs with hybrids would achieve the desired 10% improvement in overall fleet fuel efficiency.\n\nThis approach minimizes the number of replacements by focusing on the least efficient vehicles.\n\nAlternatively, the company could replace a combination of midsize sedans and SUVs.\n\nFor example, replace M midsize sedans and S SUVs with hybrids.\n\nSet up the equation accordingly and solve for M and S, but this would involve more variables and potentially more complex calculations.\n\nGiven that replacing 23 SUVs alone achieves the target, it might be the most straightforward and cost-effective solution.\n\nHowever, if hybrids are in high demand and supply is limited, the company might need to replace a combination of vehicle types.\n\nIn conclusion, replacing approximately 23 SUVs with hybrids would allow the car rental company to achieve a 10% improvement in overall fleet fuel efficiency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{23 \\text{ SUVs should be replaced with hybrids to achieve the desired fuel efficiency improvement.}}"
