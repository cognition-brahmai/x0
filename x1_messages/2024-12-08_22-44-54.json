        "content": "The first modern Olympic Games took place in 1896 in Athens, Greece. The games were held from April 6 to April 15, 1896, and featured athletes from 14 nations competing in 43 events across nine sports. The games were organized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which was founded by Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator and historian who is considered the father of the modern Olympic Games. The 1896 Olympics marked the beginning of a new era in international sports competition, and the games have since become one of the most prestigious and widely watched sporting events in the world."
