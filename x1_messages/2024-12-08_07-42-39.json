        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I have a cube with sides that are 10 inches long, and I need to find out what its volume is in cubic feet. Okay, first things first, I know that volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the length of one of its sides. So, if the side is 10 inches, the volume in cubic inches would be 10 inches times 10 inches times 10 inches, which is 1000 cubic inches.\n\nBut the question wants the volume in cubic feet, not cubic inches. So, I need to convert cubic inches to cubic feet. I recall that there are 12 inches in a foot, but since we're dealing with cubic units, I think I need to cube the conversion factor as well. So, 1 foot is 12 inches, therefore 1 cubic foot is 12 inches times 12 inches times 12 inches, which is 1728 cubic inches.\n\nSo, to convert from cubic inches to cubic feet, I should divide the volume in cubic inches by the number of cubic inches in a cubic foot. That means 1000 cubic inches divided by 1728 cubic inches per cubic foot.\n\nLet me do that division: 1000 divided by 1728. Let's see, 1728 goes into 1000 about 0.5787 times. Maybe I'll just leave it as a fraction to be more precise. 1000 / 1728 simplifies to... both numbers are divisible by 8, so 1000 divided by 8 is 125, and 1728 divided by 8 is 216. So, 125/216.\n\nHmm, I don't know if that fraction can be simplified further. Let's check: 125 is 5 cubed, and 216 is 6 cubed, so they don't share any common factors besides 1. So, the volume is 125/216 cubic feet.\n\nAlternatively, I could express it as a decimal. 125 divided by 216 is approximately 0.5787 cubic feet.\n\nSo, the volume of the cube is either 125/216 cubic feet or approximately 0.5787 cubic feet.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:\n\n- Volume of the cube in cubic inches: 10 inches * 10 inches * 10 inches = 1000 cubic inches.\n\n- Conversion factor: 1 cubic foot = 12 inches * 12 inches * 12 inches = 1728 cubic inches.\n\n- Therefore, volume in cubic feet = 1000 cubic inches / 1728 cubic inches per cubic foot = 1000/1728 cubic feet.\n\n- Simplifying 1000/1728: divide numerator and denominator by 8 -> 125/216 cubic feet.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about converting the side length from inches to feet first and then cubing it. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 10 inches is equal to 10/12 feet, which simplifies to 5/6 feet.\n\nThen, the volume would be (5/6 feet) ^3 = 5^3 / 6^3 = 125 / 216 cubic feet, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the volume is 125/216 cubic feet.\n\nAlternatively, as a decimal, 125 divided by 216 is approximately 0.5787 cubic feet.\n\nI think for precision, it's better to leave it as a fraction, so 125/216 cubic feet is the exact value, while 0.5787 is an approximation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 125/216 cubic feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{125}{216}\\text{ cubic feet}} \\]"
