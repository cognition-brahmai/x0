        "content": "So I've got this problem about renovating hotels in a chain. There are 30 hotels, each with an average of 150 rooms. Each room takes one week to renovate, and only 10 rooms can be renovated at a time per hotel without disturbing guests. I need to find out the total number of weeks required to renovate all the rooms across all hotels, considering that renovations can happen simultaneously at multiple locations.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many rooms need to be renovated in total. There are 30 hotels, each with 150 rooms on average. So, total rooms would be:\n\nTotal rooms = Number of hotels \u00d7 Average rooms per hotel\nTotal rooms = 30 \u00d7 150\nTotal rooms = 4500 rooms\n\nNext, I need to understand the renovation capacity per week for each hotel. Each hotel can renovate 10 rooms at a time, and each room takes one week to renovate. So, each hotel can complete 10 rooms per week.\n\nNow, since renovations can happen simultaneously at multiple hotels, I need to find out the total number of rooms that can be renovated per week across all hotels.\n\nTotal weekly renovation capacity = Number of hotels \u00d7 Rooms renovated per hotel per week\nTotal weekly renovation capacity = 30 \u00d7 10\nTotal weekly renovation capacity = 300 rooms per week\n\nNow, to find out the total number of weeks required to renovate all 4500 rooms, I can divide the total number of rooms by the total weekly renovation capacity.\n\nTotal weeks = Total rooms / Total weekly renovation capacity\nTotal weeks = 4500 / 300\nTotal weeks = 15 weeks\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Is there any overlapping or constraints that I might have missed?\n\nEach hotel renos 10 rooms per week. With 30 hotels working simultaneously, that's 300 rooms per week. So, 4500 rooms divided by 300 rooms per week does indeed equal 15 weeks.\n\nHowever, I should consider if all hotels can start renovations at the same time. The problem doesn't specify any limitations on when renovations can start at each hotel, so I'll assume that all hotels can begin renovations simultaneously.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that renovations can be done simultaneously at multiple locations, which aligns with my assumption.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any dependencies between the renovations of different hotels, but the problem doesn't indicate any, so I'll proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nTherefore, the total number of weeks required to complete the renovations across all hotels is 15 weeks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
