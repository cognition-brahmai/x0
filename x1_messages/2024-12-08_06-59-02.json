        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here with four boxes: A, B, C, and D, each containing a different number of balls. The relationships between the number of balls in each box are given, and the total number of balls is 50. I need to find out how many balls are in Box B.\n\nFirst, I should assign variables to represent the number of balls in each box. Let's let B represent the number of balls in Box B. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\n- Box A has 5 more balls than Box B. So, if Box B has B balls, then Box A has B + 5 balls.\n\n- Box C has twice as many balls as Box A. So, Box C has 2 times the number of balls in Box A, which is 2*(B + 5).\n\n- Box D has half as many balls as Box B. So, Box D has B/2 balls.\n\nAnd the total number of balls in all four boxes is 50. So, the sum of the balls in A, B, C, and D should equal 50.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\nA + B + C + D = 50\n\nNow, substituting the expressions in terms of B:\n\n(B + 5) + B + 2*(B + 5) + (B/2) = 50\n\nOkay, now I need to simplify this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\nB + 5 + B + 2*B + 10 + B/2 = 50\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nB + B + 2*B + B/2 + 5 + 10 = 50\n\nThat's:\n\n(1B + 1B + 2B + 0.5B) + (5 + 10) = 50\n\nAdd the B terms:\n\n1 + 1 + 2 + 0.5 = 4.5 B\n\nAnd 5 + 10 = 15\n\nSo, 4.5 B + 15 = 50\n\nNow, subtract 15 from both sides to isolate the term with B:\n\n4.5 B = 50 - 15\n\n4.5 B = 35\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4.5 to solve for B:\n\nB = 35 / 4.5\n\nHmm, 35 divided by 4.5. Let's see, 4.5 times 7 is 31.5, and 35 minus 31.5 is 3.5. So, 7 plus 3.5/4.5.\n\nWait, that's getting messy. Maybe I should convert 4.5 to a fraction to make it easier.\n\n4.5 is the same as 9/2, so:\n\nB = 35 / (9/2) = 35 * (2/9) = 70/9\n\n70 divided by 9 is approximately 7.777..., or 7 and 7/9.\n\nBut the number of balls should be a whole number, right? Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting with:\n\nA = B + 5\n\nC = 2*A = 2*(B + 5)\n\nD = B/2\n\nTotal: A + B + C + D = 50\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(B + 5) + B + 2*(B + 5) + (B/2) = 50\n\nExpand:\n\nB + 5 + B + 2B + 10 + B/2 = 50\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nB + B + 2B + B/2 + 5 + 10 = 50\n\nThat's:\n\n(4.5 B) + 15 = 50\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 4.5 B = 35\n\nB = 35 / 4.5 = 70/9 \u2248 7.777...\n\nBut having a fraction of a ball doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem allows for that, or perhaps I need to consider that the number of balls can be a fraction, but typically, balls are whole items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I set up the equations incorrectly.\n\nLet me try approaching it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of balls in Box B as B.\n\nThen:\n\n- Box A: B + 5\n\n- Box C: 2*(B + 5) = 2B + 10\n\n- Box D: B/2\n\nTotal: A + B + C + D = (B + 5) + B + (2B + 10) + (B/2) = 50\n\nCombining terms:\n\nB + B + 2B + B/2 + 5 + 10 = 50\n\nThat's:\n\n4B + B/2 + 15 = 50\n\nCombine 4B and B/2:\n\n4B is 8B/2, so 8B/2 + B/2 = 9B/2\n\nSo, 9B/2 + 15 = 50\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n9B/2 = 35\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n9B = 70\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nB = 70/9 \u2248 7.777...\n\nStill getting the same result.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects B to be 7.777..., but that seems unusual for counting balls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of balls in Box D is half of B, but since it has to be a whole number, B must be even.\n\nWait, but in that case, B being 70/9 doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to reconsider the relationships.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"Box A has 5 more balls than Box B.\"\n\n\"Box C has twice as many balls as Box A.\"\n\n\"Box D has half as many balls as Box B.\"\n\n\"Total of 50 balls in all four boxes combined.\"\n\nIs there any other way to interpret these statements?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake, or it's expecting a non-integer number of balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to solve it using a different method, like substitution.\n\nLet me set:\n\nA = B + 5\n\nC = 2*A = 2*(B + 5) = 2B + 10\n\nD = B/2\n\nThen, total: A + B + C + D = (B + 5) + B + (2B + 10) + (B/2) = 50\n\nAgain, that brings me back to the same equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2*(A + B + C + D) = 2*50\n\n2A + 2B + 2C + 2D = 100\n\nNow, substitute the expressions in terms of B:\n\n2*(B + 5) + 2*B + 2*(2B + 10) + 2*(B/2) = 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n2B + 10 + 2B + 4B + 20 + B = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2B + 2B + 4B + B = 9B\n\n10 + 20 = 30\n\nSo, 9B + 30 = 100\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n9B = 70\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nB = 70/9 \u2248 7.777...\n\nStill the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to express all variables in terms of D.\n\nGiven that D = B/2, then B = 2D\n\nA = B + 5 = 2D + 5\n\nC = 2*A = 2*(2D + 5) = 4D + 10\n\nTotal: A + B + C + D = (2D + 5) + (2D) + (4D + 10) + D = 50\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2D + 2D + 4D + D = 9D\n\n5 + 10 = 15\n\nSo, 9D + 15 = 50\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n9D = 35\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nD = 35/9 \u2248 3.888...\n\nThen, B = 2D = 70/9 \u2248 7.777...\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nThis suggests that B is 70/9, which is approximately 7.777... balls.\n\nBut since the number of balls should typically be a whole number, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for fractional balls, in which case B has 70/9 balls.\n\nBut that seems unusual.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of balls is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nBut that approach could lead to inconsistency in the total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different interpretation of \"half as many.\"\n\nWait, \"half as many\" could be interpreted as the floor or ceiling of half of B, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and one of the relationships is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to accept that B has 70/9 balls and proceed from there.\n\nBut that doesn't seem satisfying.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the number of balls in each box must be an integer, and therefore, B must be a multiple of 2 to make D an integer as well.\n\nGiven that D = B/2, B must be even.\n\nLet me assume B is even and try to find an integer solution.\n\nLet\u2019s assume B is an even integer.\n\nLet\u2019s try B = 8.\n\nThen:\n\nA = 8 + 5 = 13\n\nC = 2*13 = 26\n\nD = 8/2 = 4\n\nTotal: 13 + 8 + 26 + 4 = 41, which is less than 50.\n\nNot enough.\n\nTry B = 10.\n\nA = 10 + 5 = 15\n\nC = 2*15 = 30\n\nD = 10/2 = 5\n\nTotal: 15 + 10 + 30 + 5 = 60, which is more than 50.\n\nSo B = 8 gives 41, B = 10 gives 60.\n\nNeed something in between.\n\nTry B = 9.\n\nA = 9 + 5 = 14\n\nC = 2*14 = 28\n\nD = 9/2 = 4.5\n\nTotal: 14 + 9 + 28 + 4.5 = 55.5, still more than 50.\n\nTry B = 7.\n\nA = 7 + 5 = 12\n\nC = 2*12 = 24\n\nD = 7/2 = 3.5\n\nTotal: 12 + 7 + 24 + 3.5 = 46.5, still less than 50.\n\nTry B = 7.5.\n\nA = 7.5 + 5 = 12.5\n\nC = 2*12.5 = 25\n\nD = 7.5/2 = 3.75\n\nTotal: 12.5 + 7.5 + 25 + 3.75 = 48.75, still less than 50.\n\nTry B = 8.\n\nWait, I already tried B = 8 and got 41, but that was earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated earlier.\n\nLet me recalculate for B = 8.\n\nA = 8 + 5 = 13\n\nC = 2*13 = 26\n\nD = 8/2 = 4\n\nTotal: 13 + 8 + 26 + 4 = 41.\n\nStill less than 50.\n\nB = 9:\n\nA = 14\n\nC = 28\n\nD = 4.5\n\nTotal: 14 + 9 + 28 + 4.5 = 55.5\n\nToo much.\n\nB = 8 gives 41, B = 9 gives 55.5.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to try B = 70/9 \u2248 7.777...\n\nLet\u2019s try B = 70/9.\n\nA = 70/9 + 5 = 70/9 + 45/9 = 115/9\n\nC = 2*(115/9) = 230/9\n\nD = (70/9)/2 = 35/9\n\nTotal: 115/9 + 70/9 + 230/9 + 35/9 = (115 + 70 + 230 + 35)/9 = 450/9 = 50\n\nPerfect, that adds up.\n\nSo, B = 70/9 balls.\n\nBut again, that's not a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects B to be 70/9, acknowledging that the number of balls can be fractional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and one of the relationships is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of balls must be integers, and therefore, there is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nBut that seems unsatisfactory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for fractional balls, and the answer is B = 70/9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to express B in terms of a variable and solve for it.\n\nBut I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up the equations differently.\n\nLet me try setting up equations with all variables.\n\nLet A, B, C, D be the number of balls in boxes A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nGiven:\n\n1) A = B + 5\n\n2) C = 2*A\n\n3) D = B/2\n\n4) A + B + C + D = 50\n\nNow, substitute equations 1, 2, and 3 into equation 4:\n\n(B + 5) + B + 2*(B + 5) + (B/2) = 50\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo, I end up with the same equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution differently.\n\nFrom equation 1: A = B + 5\n\nFrom equation 3: D = B/2\n\nFrom equation 2: C = 2*A = 2*(B + 5) = 2B + 10\n\nNow, substitute into equation 4:\n\n(A) + B + (C) + D = 50\n\n(B + 5) + B + (2B + 10) + (B/2) = 50\n\nAgain, same equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me solve for A, C, D in terms of B.\n\nA = B + 5\n\nC = 2*A = 2*(B + 5) = 2B + 10\n\nD = B/2\n\nNow, plug into the total:\n\nA + B + C + D = (B + 5) + B + (2B + 10) + (B/2) = 50\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nB + B + 2B + B/2 + 5 + 10 = 50\n\nThat's:\n\n4B + B/2 + 15 = 50\n\nCombine 4B and B/2:\n\n4B is 8B/2, so 8B/2 + B/2 = 9B/2\n\nSo, 9B/2 + 15 = 50\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n9B/2 = 35\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n9B = 70\n\nDivide by 9:\n\nB = 70/9\n\nSo, B = 70/9, which is approximately 7.777...\n\nTherefore, Box B has 70/9 balls.\n\nBut since the number of balls should typically be a whole number, it's possible that the problem allows for fractional balls or there might be an error in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships between the boxes are meant to be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of balls in Box D is the integer half of Box B, implying that Box B must be even.\n\nBut then, with B = 8, total is 41, which is less than 50, and B = 10 gives 60, which is more than 50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects B to be 70/9, acknowledging the fractional value.\n\nGiven that, Box B has 70/9 balls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{70}{9}} \\]"
