        "content": "Let's see. So, there were 4 pizzas, and each pizza was cut into 8 slices. That means the total number of pizza slices is 4 pizzas times 8 slices per pizza, which is 32 slices. Now, each person ate 3 slices. To find out how many people were in the group, I need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices each person ate. So, 32 slices divided by 3 slices per person. But 32 divided by 3 is 10 with a remainder of 2. That means 10 people ate 3 slices each, and there are 2 slices left over. Hmm, maybe there were 10 people, and they didn't finish all the pizza, or perhaps there were 11 people, but the last one only ate 2 slices. But the problem says each person ate 3 slices, so maybe it's just 10 people, and there were 2 slices leftover. Or perhaps the group was 10 people, and they shared the last 2 slices among themselves. I'm a bit confused about what to do with the remaining 2 slices. Maybe I should consider that the number of people is 32 divided by 3, which is approximately 10.67, but you can't have a fraction of a person. Maybe the problem expects us to assume that only whole people are considered, and each ate exactly 3 slices, with some slices left over. So, the answer would be 10 people. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, and it's not possible for each person to eat exactly 3 slices with 4 pizzas cut into 8 slices each, because 32 isn't divisible by 3. Wait, maybe I should check my division again. 3 times 10 is 30, and 32 minus 30 is 2, so yes, there are 2 slices left over. So, the answer is 10 people, with 2 slices remaining. I think that's the best answer I can come up with based on the information given."
