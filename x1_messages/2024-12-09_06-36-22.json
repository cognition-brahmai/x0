        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. In a month with 30 days, each day either rains or doesn't rain. It's given that it rained for 15 days, and I need to find the probability that it rained on the last day of the month.\n\nHmm, okay. So, total days: 30. Rained days: 15. I need to find the probability that day 30 was one of those rainy days.\n\nFirst, I should think about what kind of probability this is. It seems like a conditional probability because it's given that there were 15 rainy days in the month.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"each day either rains or doesn't rain,\" and it rained for 15 days. So, it's like we have a fixed number of rainy days, and we want to know the probability that a specific day, the last day, was one of them.\n\nMaybe I can think of it as selecting 15 days out of 30 to be rainy days, and then seeing if the last day is one of those selected days.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 15 rainy days out of 30 is \"30 choose 15,\" which is the combination formula C(30,15).\n\nNow, the number of ways in which the last day is rainy would be the number of ways to choose the remaining 14 rainy days from the first 29 days, which is C(29,14).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the last day is rainy is C(29,14) divided by C(30,15).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, C(30,15) is 30! / (15! * 15!), and C(29,14) is 29! / (14! * 15!).\n\nSo, the probability is [29! / (14! * 15!)] / [30! / (15! * 15!)]\n\nSimplifying this, the 15! in the numerator and denominator cancels out, and 30! is 30 * 29!, so it becomes:\n\n[29! / (14! * 15!)] / [30 * 29! / (15! * 15!)] = [1 / (14! * 15!)] / [30 / (15! * 15!)] = [14! * 15!] / [30 * 14! * 15!] = 1 / 30.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If I have 15 rainy days out of 30, the probability that any particular day was rainy should be 15/30 = 1/2.\n\nBut according to my calculation, it's 1/30, which doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me think differently. If there are 15 rainy days out of 30, and each day is equally likely to be rainy, then the probability that any given day, including the last day, was rainy is simply 15/30 = 1/2.\n\nSo, why did I get 1/30 earlier? Ah, I see. In my first approach, I was treating the selection of rainy days as equally likely among all possible combinations, which is correct. But my calculation was wrong.\n\nLet's recalculate.\n\nC(29,14) / C(30,15) = [29! / (14! * 15!)] / [30! / (15! * 15!)] = [29! * 15! * 15!] / [14! * 15! * 30!)] = [29! * 15!] / [14! * 30!]\n\nNow, 30! = 30 * 29!, so it's [29! * 15!] / [14! * 30 * 29!)] = [15!] / [14! * 30]\n\nAnd 15! = 15 * 14!, so [15 * 14!] / [14! * 30] = 15 / 30 = 1/2.\n\nOh, now I see. I must have messed up the factorials earlier. So, the correct probability is indeed 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: there are 30 days, 15 rainy. The probability that day 30 is rainy is the same as the proportion of rainy days, which is 15/30 = 1/2.\n\nOr, imagine arranging the 15 rainy days randomly among the 30 days. The probability that a specific day is rainy is 15/30 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1/2.\n\nBut let me double-check with another approach. Suppose I number the days from 1 to 30. The probability that day 30 is rainy is the same as the probability that any other day is rainy, since there's no reason to favor one day over another.\n\nTherefore, the probability is simply 15/30 = 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a sequence of 30 days, with 15 rainy days distributed randomly. The probability that day 30 is rainy is 15/30 = 1/2.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I got 1/30 due to a calculation error, but upon correcting it, it also gives 1/2.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
