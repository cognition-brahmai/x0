        "content": "Cycling without a helmet in Australia can have several consequences, both legal and personal. \n\nFirstly, from a legal perspective, wearing a helmet while cycling is mandatory in all Australian states and territories. Failing to wear one can result in fines and penalties. The exact amount of the fine can vary depending on the jurisdiction, but it is generally around $A50 to $A100.\n\nSecondly, from a personal safety standpoint, not wearing a helmet can lead to serious head injuries in the event of an accident. Helmets are designed to absorb impact and protect the head from trauma. According to various studies, wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of head injury by up to 85%.\n\nMoreover, even minor accidents can result in significant injuries without proper head protection. So, for both legal and safety reasons, it's highly recommended to wear a helmet while cycling in Australia.\n\n**Note:** It's always best to check the local laws and regulations regarding cycling helmets, as rules can change or differ slightly between states and territories."
