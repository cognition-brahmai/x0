Below is a Python script that calculates the sum, average, and standard deviation of a list of numbers provided by the user.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0, 0, 0\n    \n    total_sum = sum(numbers)\n    average = total_sum / n\n    \n    if n < 2:\n        return total_sum, average, 0\n    \n    variance = sum((x - average) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (n - 1)\n    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)\n    \n    return total_sum, average, standard_deviation\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by commas: \")\n    number_list = list(map(float, input_str.split(',')))\n    \n    sum_result, average, std_dev = calculate_statistics(number_list)\n    \n    print(f\"Sum: {sum_result}\")\n    print(f\"Average: {average}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - `calculate_statistics(numbers)`: This function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum, average, and standard deviation.\n     - It first checks if the list is empty and returns zeros for all statistics in that case.\n     - It calculates the sum and average of the numbers.\n     - For standard deviation, it calculates the variance first using the formula for sample variance (dividing by n-1) and then takes the square root to get the standard deviation.\n   \n2. **Main Function:**\n   - `main()`: This is the main function that handles user input and output.\n     - It prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by commas.\n     - It converts the input string into a list of floats.\n     - It calls `calculate_statistics()` with this list and prints the results.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - The script starts execution from the `main()` function when run directly.\n\nThis script ensures that the user can input a list of numbers, and it will compute and display the sum, average, and standard deviation of those numbers accurately."
