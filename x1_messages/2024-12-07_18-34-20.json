I'll start by searching the web to find recent statistics on Tokyo's population and GDP.\n\n#Evidence1 = BingSearch[\"population and GDP of Tokyo\"]\n\nPlan: Now that I have search results from Bing, I need to identify credible sources from these results. I'll look for official government websites, reputable news sources, or well-known statistical databases.\n\n#Evidence2 = URLCollector[#Evidence1]\n\nPlan: With the list of URLs collected, I need to read the contents of these webpages to find the specific information about Tokyo's population and GDP.\n\n#Evidence3 = PageReader[#Evidence2[0]], PageReader[#Evidence2[1]], ..., PageReader[#Evidence2[n]]\n\nPlan: Once I have the webpage contents, I can use QuerySolver to extract the population and GDP figures from these texts.\n\n#Evidence4 = QuerySolver[\"What is the population of Tokyo?\", input: #Evidence3[0]], QuerySolver[\"What is the GDP of Tokyo?\", input: #Evidence3[0]]\n\nPlan: I should cross-verify the information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy. So, I'll repeat the QuerySolver step for each webpage content.\n\n#Evidence5 = QuerySolver[\"What is the population of Tokyo?\", input: #Evidence3[1]], QuerySolver[\"What is the GDP of Tokyo?\", input: #Evidence3[1]]\n\n...\n\n#Evidence[n] = QuerySolver[\"What is the population of Tokyo?\", input: #Evidence3[m]], QuerySolver[\"What is the GDP of Tokyo?\", input: #Evidence3[m]]\n\nPlan: After collecting data from multiple sources, I need to compile the information and provide a consolidated answer.\n\nFinal Response: Based on the data from various sources, the population of Tokyo is approximately [population figure], and its GDP is around [GDP figure]. It's important to note that these figures can vary slightly depending on the source and the year of the data."
