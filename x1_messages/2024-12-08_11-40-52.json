        "content": "Light travels at a speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second in a vacuum. To find out how far it travels in one hour, we can multiply this speed by the number of seconds in an hour.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of seconds in one hour:\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\nTherefore, 1 hour = 60 minutes \u00d7 60 seconds per minute = 3,600 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance light travels in one hour:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 299,792 kilometers/second \u00d7 3,600 seconds\n\nDistance = 1,079,250,240 kilometers\n\nSo, light travels approximately 1,079,250,240 kilometers in one hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1,079,250,240 \\text{ kilometers}} \\]"
