This tool is particularly useful in gaining knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, and other types of factual information.\nQuestionSolver[input]: Tool that can answer questions either directly from common sense and general world knowledge, as well as answering questions given input context that may contain the answer.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (:evidence[index]) value.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence1: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence1:]\n...\nFinal answer: :evidence[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the history of the Great Wall of China and what materials were used in its construction?"
