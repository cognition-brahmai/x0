Ventilators cost $15,000 each, defibrillators cost $3,500 each, and patient monitors cost $2,000 each. Additionally, the hospital receives a bulk discount of 10% on the total cost if they purchase all the equipment from one supplier. Calculate the total cost after applying the discount and provide your reasoning."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out the total cost of each type of medical equipment before any discount is applied.\n\nStarting with the ventilators:\n\n- The hospital needs 20 ventilators.\n\n- Each ventilator costs $15,000.\n\nSo, the total cost for ventilators is:\n\n20 ventilators * $15,000/ventilator = $300,000.\n\nNext, the defibrillators:\n\n- They need 30 defibrillators.\n\n- Each defibrillator costs $3,500.\n\nSo, the total cost for defibrillators is:\n\n30 defibrillators * $3,500/defibrillator = $105,000.\n\nNow, the patient monitors:\n\n- They need 40 patient monitors.\n\n- Each patient monitor costs $2,000.\n\nSo, the total cost for patient monitors is:\n\n40 patient monitors * $2,000/patient monitor = $80,000.\n\nNow, let's add up these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:\n\nTotal cost before discount = cost of ventilators + cost of defibrillators + cost of patient monitors\n\n= $300,000 + $105,000 + $80,000\n\n= $485,000.\n\nThe hospital gets a bulk discount of 10% if they purchase all the equipment from one supplier. So, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost and then subtract that from the total cost to get the discounted total.\n\nFirst, calculate the discount amount:\n\nDiscount = 10% of $485,000\n\n= 0.10 * $485,000\n\n= $48,500.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the total cost before discount:\n\nTotal cost after discount = $485,000 - $48,500 = $436,500.\n\nSo, the total cost after applying the 10% bulk discount is $436,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{436500} \\]"
