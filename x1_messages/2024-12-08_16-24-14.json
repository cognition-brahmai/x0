Plus, is there such a thing as too much Oprah? Plus, Sarah Palin`s star power, what will Sarah`s next move be as she fields hundreds of offers from all over the world? SIMMONS: President-elect Obama, don`t forget, I know you`re busy - cabinet members, ambassador of fitness. I come with my own wardrobe. HAMMER: He`s back. Richard Simmons bursts on to the SHOWBIZ TONIGHT set in Hollywood and it will never be the same. Tonight, Richard Simmons` fitness advice for Barack Obama in the high-energy interview you`ll see only on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. TV`s most provocative entertainment news show continues right now. ANDERSON: And I`m Brooke Anderson coming to you tonight from Hollywood. HAMMER: Well, tonight, SHOWBIZ TONIGHT is taking you inside Oprah Winfrey`s remarkable plan to start her own Oprah cable TV network. What will the Oprah Winfrey network mean for her daily show as we know it now? Could it spell disaster for the queen of all media if there`s just too much Oprah, too much of the time? And from Oprah to Barbara Walters and even foreign countries, it seems everybody is clamoring for Sarah. New right now, brand-new revelations about the star power of Sarah Palin. She is back in Alaska, but wait until you hear about the demand for Sarah the star still. It`s amazing. Joining me tonight in New York, an amazing panel, Jami Floyd, an \"In Session\" anchor. Also in New York tonight is Janell Snowden, host of \"VH1 News.\" And Dawn Yanek, who`s the editor-at-large for \"Life and Style Weekly.\" All right. Gang, let us begin with Oprah`s new network, set to debut later next year. No schedule of shows announced yet but there`s word that Oprah`s show will actually move there when her contract is up in three years. Jami, let me begin with you. Does Oprah Winfrey need to be careful that there`s enough variety on this cable network so it`s not all Oprah all the time? JAMI FLOYD, ANCHOR, \"IN SESSION\": Sure. Listen, if she needs to fill a time slot, I`ll be available. She can give a call. Look, here`s the thing, this is a media opportunity for Oprah. But it doesn`t need to be Oprah 24/7. And she knows that. This is a woman who has incredible good sense and judgment and actual - you know, I guess I`d call it the Midas touch, when she touches anything having to do with media. So what I think will happen is she will use this as a platform to launch good ideas, good people, things that she sees as possible media ventures. She`s done it with Dr. Phil, Rachael Ray, Gayle King, on and on. She has these brilliant ideas. This gives her a place to put these people, not the ones who have already launched their own careers. HAMMER: Sure. FLOYD: But every time she spots talent, she can place it there. She doesn`t have to be even a part of the show. But she has an eye for what works for the American people and on television. I think it`s going to be terrific. HAMMER: Well, you point out her good sense and her good judgment. And that has led to her having adoring fans all over the world. Dawn, what do you think? You know, with so many people just loving everything Oprah, is there such a thing as too much Oprah? DAWN YANEK, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, \"LIFE AND STYLE WEEKLY\": You know, I agree. It can`t be all Oprah all the time. What she has to do is build on her brand. So I think what we need to see here are things that are inspirational, things that will get people buzzing, talking at the water cooler. And ideally, even things that cross the gender divide. We don`t want just all women flocking to this network. I really want some shows that are going to attract men. That`s going to boost ratings. I mean, let`s face it. We`re in a pretty bad economy right now. People are staying home. They need new entertainment. This is a heck of a lot less expensive than going out to a fancy dinner or going on vacation. So they need options. HAMMER: And maybe our crappy economy really needs the golden Midas touch that Jami refers to. You know, she`s had it with everything she`s done, which is the magazine, the movies, launching talk shows like Dr. Phil and Rachael Ray. Janell, are you confident that that Midas touch will continue to work with Oprah`s own network? JANELL SNOWDEN, HOST, \"VH1 NEWS\": How could it not? I mean, she truly does have the Midas touch like Jami said. I don`t think she`s ever failed at anything, besides maybe some TV movies. But then, they weren`t even failures because they made it to TV. I mean, failure is relative, you know what I mean? And so, Oprah has such amazing business acumen. I mean, you think of all the successful TV talking head or TV hosts. I mean, very few - none have reached the level of success that Oprah has. And it`s not just because of sheer talent. It`s because she has incredible business judgment. I mean, she is a self-made billionaire. So I don`t think that she has anything to worry about in the economy. Everything that she does is a calculated risk. I mean, look at Rachael Ray. She won the Emmy for outstanding daytime talk show, I believe it was. Then Dr. Phil, his show is on for six seasons. She definitely knows what she`s doing. And I trust that this is a well-thought out plan. HAMMER: Yes. I think that`s definitely what everybody is feeling right now. You guys have made some suggestions for what we`re actually hearing is going to be a part of the network. The trades are reporting that we can expect things like inspirational programming, motivational shows, lifestyle shows. And Oprah, as I mentioned, may move her daily show, the one we see for one hour every day, to her cable network when that current contract ends in three years. Jami, if she does move \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" over to the cable network, do you think she could be at risk of losing a big chunk of her audience? FLOYD: You know, even if - she gets about seven million viewers a day. In daytime, we know that`s huge, that`s huge in daytime, even on network and a syndicated world. Even if she takes half those people, that`s a big number in cable - primetime cable. You`re talking a million or two viewers for some of the top shows. That is just a completely different calculus. Plus, I think she`ll take her viewers with her. The question is, she needs to expand that base, expand that brand as my colleagues have said. She wants to reach beyond just that daily viewership and maybe bring in some men and bring in younger people and begin thinking about expanding the audience. But she can certainly start with her base of seven million a day. HAMMER: Yes. And it`s going to be really interesting. All eyes will be watching whether or not that show moves over and I think some of the programmers on those broadcast stations are quaking in their boots a little bit on the chance that may happen. One big star Oprah and many others are trying to get on their shows is Sarah Palin. And tonight, we have brand-new information about how in demand Sarah Palin remains. And I`ve got to tell you, this is just amazing. Look at some of these examples. She has gotten an astonishing 800 requests for paid appearances around the world. More than 200 requests for interviews, even a request to appear at a 5-year-old`s birthday party. Haven`t heard a thing about any bar mitzvahs, but maybe that, too. Dawn what do you think? She lost the election. It`s over. Why are people still so obsessed with everything Sarah Palin? YANEK: Well, simply put, she`s a really interesting figure. She was a political phenomenon. She was a pop culture phenomenon. That was certainly helped along I think by Tina Fey`s portrayal on \"SNL.\" Everybody was talking about it. And no matter which side of the party line you fall on, you want to hear what she has to say next. So everybody wants her on their show. It`s an instant ratings boost. But let me tell you, not everybody has her best intentions at heart. So she`s got to be careful. HAMMER: Yes. She definitely does have her detractors. But you know, she`s got an awful lot of people who love her and are even willing to pay to show their love. I want you to take a look at a new commercial which was paid for by Sarah Palin supporters, thanking her for all of her hard work representing regular folks, don`t you know. Watch this. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Gov. Palin. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Gov. Palin. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We thank you for fighting for everyday working families. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`ve given us hope. We just wanted to say - CROWD: Thank you, Sarah Palin. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What were those ingredients again for the moose chili? HAMMER: Ah, the old moose chili. I don`t even know what to say about that. I feel like watching that again. Janell, it seems like even if Sarah Palin wanted to fade into obscurity, which we know she does, her supporters definitely do not want to let her go. Why do you suppose that is? SNOWDEN: I am speechless. I mean, could you play it just one more time for me, just for my own person enjoyment? That was almost like an \"SNL\" skit or something. You know, I think she`s definitely made her mark. I was just listening to - I think it was an interview that Katie Couric was doing the other day where she made note that, you know, she`s a rock star among the Republican set. I mean, you know, she drew crowds in massive numbers. And I think she`s just an interesting figure, like Dawn said. I mean I think that we`re all going to be glued to finding out what she does next. She has so many options. HAMMER: Yes. SNOWDEN: You know, I wish her the best. HAMMER: Well, you know, there`s been buzz really before the election was even over that she might want to run in 2012. Jami, let me ask you this quickly. Do you think that she could actually sustain interest for the next four years, especially if she continues to do all these interviews in magazines? FLOYD: No. Not if she continues. I think there are a couple of really tough questions that need to be asked. The Republican Party has to ask itself, what is this party about? Is it the party of Sarah Palin or is it the party of, say, Colin Powell and others that are more traditional Republicans? That`s the big question for their next time around. But Sarah Palin also needs to ask herself some questions. HAMMER: Sure. FLOYD: Is she a substantive person who wants to be taken seriously in the political arena, or is she a silly celebrity? Now, listen, I`m happy that we have lots of silly celebrities. They make the world go around. But she has to really question what her purpose is. HAMMER: Substance - FLOYD: Does she study up and get ready for the White House? Or does she keep gallivanting around the airwaves? HAMMER: Got to end it there. Substance over silly and a round of moose chili for all of you. Jami Floyd, Janell Snowden, Dawn Yanek, I thank you. All right.
