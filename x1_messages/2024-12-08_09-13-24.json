        "content": "So the national park is planning to introduce a shuttle service to transport visitors between different attractions. They expect around 3000 visitors per day during peak season, and each shuttle can hold up to 50 passengers. The park wants to make sure that visitors don't have to wait more than 30 minutes for the next shuttle, and each shuttle trip takes 1 hour to complete a round trip. I need to figure out how many shuttles they need to meet these requirements.\n\nFirst, I should understand the constraints and what's being asked. We have an average of 3000 visitors per day, and we need to transport them using shuttles that can hold 50 passengers each. The waiting time between shuttles should be no more than 30 minutes, and each shuttle takes 1 hour to do a round trip.\n\nI think I need to find out how many shuttles are required to carry all the visitors within these time constraints.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many shuttle trips are needed in a day.\n\nAssuming the park is open for, say, 10 hours a day during peak season. So, from 9 AM to 5 PM, for example.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem doesn't specify the number of hours the park is open or the shuttle service operates. Maybe I need to assume that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the shuttle service operating during the peak visiting hours.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me see. Since it's a daily operation, maybe it's better to assume the shuttle service operates for a certain number of hours each day, say 10 hours, from 9 AM to 7 PM.\n\nBut to be more precise, perhaps I should try to calculate based on the total number of visitors and the shuttle capacity.\n\nEach shuttle can carry 50 passengers, and there are 3000 visitors per day.\n\nSo, total shuttles needed = total visitors / capacity per shuttle\n\nThat would be 3000 / 50 = 60 shuttles per day.\n\nBut that doesn't take into account the time constraints.\n\nBecause each shuttle can do multiple trips in a day, since each round trip takes 1 hour.\n\nSo, if a shuttle can do multiple trips in a day, the number of shuttles needed would be less than 60.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose the shuttle service operates for a certain number of hours, say H hours per day.\n\nEach shuttle can complete one round trip every hour.\n\nSo, per shuttle, the number of trips per day is H.\n\nEach trip carries 50 passengers.\n\nTherefore, total passengers transported per day by one shuttle is 50 * H.\n\nTotal passengers needed to be transported is 3000.\n\nSo, number of shuttles required = 3000 / (50 * H).\n\nBut I don't know H yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the waiting time constraint.\n\nThe park wants to maintain a maximum waiting time of 30 minutes between shuttles.\n\nThat means that shuttles should depart every 30 minutes.\n\nIf each shuttle takes 1 hour for a round trip, then I need to figure out how many shuttles are needed to have one departing every 30 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of shuttle frequency.\n\nIf shuttles depart every 30 minutes, then in one hour, there are two departures.\n\nSince each shuttle takes 1 hour for a round trip, meaning that one shuttle can do two trips in two hours, but that doesn't directly help.\n\nLet me try to approach it differently.\n\nSuppose we have N shuttles.\n\nEach shuttle can do 1 trip per hour.\n\nEach trip carries 50 passengers.\n\nSo, total passengers transported per hour is N * 50.\n\nNow, we need to find out what the demand is per hour.\n\nGiven that there are 3000 visitors per day, and assuming the park is open for H hours, then visitors per hour = 3000 / H.\n\nWe need N * 50 >= 3000 / H.\n\nTherefore, N >= (3000 / H) / 50 = 60 / H.\n\nBut again, I don't know H.\n\nMaybe I need to make an assumption about H.\n\nLet's assume the park is open for 10 hours a day.\n\nThen, N >= 60 / 10 = 6 shuttles.\n\nBut I also have to consider the waiting time constraint.\n\nThe waiting time should be no more than 30 minutes.\n\nIf shuttles depart every 30 minutes, then in one hour, there are two departures.\n\nSo, to have two departures per hour, we need at least two shuttles per hour.\n\nWait, but each shuttle can only do one trip per hour, since each trip takes 1 hour.\n\nSo, to have a shuttle departing every 30 minutes, we need at least two shuttles operating simultaneously.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of shuttle schedules.\n\nSuppose we have N shuttles all following the same route, departing at regular intervals.\n\nEach shuttle takes 1 hour for a round trip.\n\nTo maintain a 30-minute headway (time between departures), we need to have a shuttle departing every 30 minutes.\n\nSince each shuttle takes 1 hour for a round trip, the number of shuttles needed to maintain this headway is:\n\nHeadway time = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours.\n\nRound trip time = 1 hour.\n\nNumber of shuttles = Round trip time / Headway time = 1 / 0.5 = 2 shuttles.\n\nSo, to maintain a 30-minute waiting time, we need at least 2 shuttles on this route.\n\nBut earlier, based on the total passenger capacity, I got N >= 6.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider both constraints.\n\nThe first constraint is the passenger capacity: N >= 6.\n\nThe second constraint is the waiting time: N >= 2.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy both, I need the maximum of these two values, which is N >= 6.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider that more shuttles can reduce the waiting time.\n\nIf I have more shuttles, I can have more frequent departures.\n\nBut the waiting time is determined by the headway, which is the time between departures.\n\nIf I have N shuttles, each doing one trip per hour, then the headway is 1 hour / N shuttles.\n\nSo, headway = 1 / N hours.\n\nTo have a headway of less than or equal to 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we need:\n\n1 / N <= 0.5\n\nTherefore, N >= 1 / 0.5 = 2 shuttles.\n\nBut this seems to contradict the earlier calculation based on passenger capacity.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that each shuttle can serve multiple trips per day, but the headway determines how many shuttles are needed to maintain the desired frequency.\n\nLet me try to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nFirst, based on passenger capacity:\n\nTotal visitors per day: 3000.\n\nEach shuttle trip carries 50 passengers.\n\nEach shuttle can do 1 trip per hour.\n\nIf the park is open for H hours, then each shuttle can do H trips per day.\n\nTherefore, total passengers transported per day is N * H * 50.\n\nWe need N * H * 50 >= 3000.\n\nTherefore, N >= 3000 / (H * 50) = 60 / H.\n\nIf H = 10 hours, then N >= 6 shuttles.\n\nSecond, based on headway:\n\nTo have a headway of 0.5 hours, with each shuttle taking 1 hour per round trip, the number of shuttles needed is:\n\nNumber of shuttles = Round trip time / Headway time = 1 / 0.5 = 2 shuttles.\n\nBut this is per route.\n\nIf there is only one route, then N >= 2.\n\nBut considering the passenger capacity, N >= 6.\n\nSo, I need to satisfy both constraints, which means N >= 6.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider that each shuttle can only be in one place at a time.\n\nIf I have N shuttles, and each does one trip per hour, then in one hour, N shuttles can depart.\n\nIf I want a shuttle to depart every 30 minutes, then in one hour, I need 2 departures.\n\nTherefore, N >= 2 shuttles.\n\nBut again, considering the total passenger capacity, N >= 6.\n\nSo, perhaps N = 6 shuttles would suffice.\n\nLet me check.\n\nWith N = 6 shuttles, each doing one trip per hour, in 10 hours, each shuttle does 10 trips.\n\nTotal passengers transported: 6 * 10 * 50 = 3000 passengers, which meets the demand.\n\nAdditionally, to maintain a 30-minute headway, we need at least 2 shuttles.\n\nBut with 6 shuttles, we can have more frequent departures, but the headway is determined by the frequency needed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about how the shuttles are scheduled.\n\nIf I have 6 shuttles, and each does one trip per hour, then in one hour, 6 shuttles can depart.\n\nIf I want a headway of 30 minutes, that's two departures per hour.\n\nSo, with 6 shuttles, I can have a higher frequency than required.\n\nWait, but actually, if I have N shuttles, each doing one trip per hour, and I need a headway of 0.5 hours, then the number of shuttles needed is:\n\nNumber of shuttles = Round trip time / Headway time = 1 / 0.5 = 2 shuttles.\n\nBut this seems conflicting.\n\nMaybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider the cycle time.\n\nEach shuttle takes 1 hour for a round trip.\n\nTo have a shuttle depart every 30 minutes, I need to have a shuttle ready to depart every 30 minutes.\n\nGiven that each shuttle takes 1 hour to return, I need enough shuttles to cover the departures during that time.\n\nSo, if a shuttle departs at time t, it will return at time t + 1 hour.\n\nIf I want another shuttle to depart at time t + 0.5 hours, I need another shuttle.\n\nSo, to cover the departures every 0.5 hours, I need:\n\nAt time t: Shuttle 1 departs.\n\nAt time t + 0.5 hours: Shuttle 2 departs.\n\nAt time t + 1 hour: Shuttle 1 returns and can depart again.\n\nBut Shuttle 2 has not yet returned.\n\nSo, to have a shuttle depart every 0.5 hours, I need at least 2 shuttles.\n\nWith 2 shuttles, I can have one departing every 30 minutes.\n\nShuttle 1 departs at t, arrives back at t + 1.\n\nShuttle 2 departs at t + 0.5, arrives back at t + 1.5.\n\nThen, Shuttle 1 can depart again at t + 1, Shuttle 2 at t + 1.5, and so on.\n\nSo, with 2 shuttles, I can maintain a 30-minute headway.\n\nBut considering the passenger capacity, I need to transport 3000 passengers per day.\n\nEach shuttle does 1 trip per hour, and is operating for H hours.\n\nIf H = 10, then each shuttle can do 10 trips per day.\n\nEach trip carries 50 passengers, so each shuttle can transport 50 * 10 = 500 passengers per day.\n\nWith 2 shuttles, that's 1000 passengers per day, which is less than the required 3000.\n\nSo, 2 shuttles are insufficient based on passenger capacity.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that N >= 6 shuttles based on passenger capacity.\n\nBut to maintain the headway, I need at least 2 shuttles.\n\nSo, I need to find a number N that satisfies both constraints.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that with more shuttles, I can have more frequent departures, but the headway is already satisfied with 2 shuttles.\n\nHowever, the passenger capacity requires 6 shuttles.\n\nSo, perhaps N = 6 shuttles is sufficient.\n\nWith 6 shuttles, each doing 10 trips per day, total passengers transported = 6 * 10 * 50 = 3000, which meets the demand.\n\nAdditionally, with 6 shuttles, I can have a higher frequency of departures.\n\nIf I have 6 shuttles, and each does one trip per hour, then in one hour, 6 shuttles can depart.\n\nIf I want a headway of 30 minutes, which is 2 departures per hour, then 6 shuttles can actually provide a much higher frequency, like a departure every 10 minutes (60 minutes / 6 shuttles = 10 minutes headway).\n\nBut the park only requires a maximum waiting time of 30 minutes, so 6 shuttles would more than suffice in terms of frequency.\n\nTherefore, considering both passenger capacity and waiting time constraints, N = 6 shuttles are needed.\n\nBut perhaps I should verify this.\n\nLet's consider the passenger arrival rate.\n\nAssuming visitors arrive throughout the day, let's say over H = 10 hours.\n\nThen, average arrival rate is 3000 / 10 = 300 visitors per hour.\n\nEach shuttle carries 50 passengers.\n\nSo, to transport 300 visitors per hour, number of shuttles needed per hour is 300 / 50 = 6 shuttles per hour.\n\nBut each shuttle can do one trip per hour.\n\nTherefore, N = 6 shuttles can meet the hourly demand.\n\nAdditionally, with 6 shuttles operating, if they are evenly spaced, the headway would be 10 minutes (60 minutes / 6 shuttles).\n\nThis is better than the required 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, N = 6 shuttles satisfy both the passenger capacity and the waiting time constraints.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that N >= 6 based on passenger capacity, and N >= 2 based on headway.\n\nSo, N = 6 satisfies both.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if fewer shuttles could suffice if the headway is longer.\n\nHowever, the park wants a maximum waiting time of 30 minutes, so N = 6 ensures that the waiting time is much less than 30 minutes, and the capacity is met.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider N = 5 shuttles.\n\nThen, total passengers per day = 5 * 10 * 50 = 2500, which is less than 3000.\n\nSo, N = 5 is insufficient.\n\nWith N = 6, it's 3000 passengers, which is exactly what's needed.\n\nTherefore, the park needs 6 shuttles to meet the requirements.\n\n**Final
