        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular room with an area of 300 square feet, and one side measures 15 feet. I need to find out how long the other side is. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if I have a rectangle, and I know one side and the area, I should be able to find the other side. In this case, the area is 300 square feet, and one side is 15 feet.\n\nLet me denote the unknown side as \"x\" feet. So, according to the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\nHere, the area is 300 sq ft, one side (let's say length) is 15 ft, and the other side (width) is x ft.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n300 = 15 \u00d7 x\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To isolate x, I can divide both sides of the equation by 15.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 300 \u00f7 15\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n15 times 20 is 300, so x must be 20 feet.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can use another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. So, if one side is 15 feet, the side opposite to it is also 15 feet, and the other two sides are equal to each other.\n\nBut in this problem, it doesn't specify which side is the length and which is the width. It just says one side is 15 feet. So, to avoid confusion, sticking with the area formula should be sufficient.\n\nLet me try plugging the value back into the formula to verify:\n\nArea = 15 ft \u00d7 20 ft = 300 sq ft\n\nYes, that matches the given area. So, the other side is indeed 20 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I visualize the room, and assume that one side is 15 feet, then to get an area of 300 square feet, the other side must be such that when multiplied by 15, it gives 300. So, again, 300 divided by 15 is 20.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the units. Since area is in square feet, and one side is in feet, the other side must also be in feet, and their product gives the area in square feet.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the other side should be 20 feet.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider if there's any other factor that might affect this, like units of measurement. The problem states everything in feet and square feet, so the units are consistent.\n\nAlso, since we're dealing with a rectangle, which is a type of quadrilateral with four right angles, the sides are perpendicular to each other, which confirms that the area formula applies correctly.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider more complex scenarios, as this is a straightforward problem involving the area of a rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the length of the other side is 20 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
