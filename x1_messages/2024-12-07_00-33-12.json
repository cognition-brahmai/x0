        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we've got a hotel chain that's looking to expand in a tourist hotspot. They currently have five hotels with a total of 1,000 rooms, and they plan to add three new hotels with an additional 600 rooms over the next three years. That sounds like a significant undertaking!\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the required investment for land acquisition, construction, and furnishing of these new hotels. The assumption is that the average cost per room is $150,000. So, for 600 rooms, the total investment would be:\n\nTotal Investment = Number of Rooms \u00d7 Cost per Room\nTotal Investment = 600 rooms \u00d7 $150,000/room\nTotal Investment = $90,000,000\n\nSo, the hotel chain needs to invest $90 million to get these new hotels up and running.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the potential revenue generated by these new properties. To do that, I'll need to consider the average daily rate and the occupancy rate. The average daily rate is given as $200, and the occupancy rate is 70%.\n\nFirst, let's find out the daily revenue. Daily Revenue can be calculated as:\n\nDaily Revenue = Number of Rooms \u00d7 Average Daily Rate \u00d7 Occupancy Rate\nDaily Revenue = 600 rooms \u00d7 $200/room \u00d7 70%\nDaily Revenue = 600 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 0.7\nDaily Revenue = $84,000\n\nSo, the new hotels could bring in $84,000 per day.\n\nBut to get a better understanding, maybe it's useful to calculate the annual revenue. There are 365 days in a year, so:\n\nAnnual Revenue = Daily Revenue \u00d7 365\nAnnual Revenue = $84,000/day \u00d7 365 days/year\nAnnual Revenue = $30,660,000/year\n\nThat's quite substantial. So, annually, the new hotels could generate about $30.66 million.\n\nBut wait, the expansion is happening over three years. Does that mean the three new hotels are being built gradually, or are they all being built at once? The problem doesn't specify, but I'll assume that all three hotels with 600 rooms in total are being built over the three-year period, and they start generating revenue gradually as they open.\n\nIf they open one hotel per year, with, say, 200 rooms each year, then the revenue would increase incrementally.\n\nLet's consider that scenario:\n\nYear 1: 200 rooms open.\nDaily Revenue Year 1 = 200 rooms \u00d7 $200/room \u00d7 70% = $28,000/day\nAnnual Revenue Year 1 = $28,000/day \u00d7 365 = $10,220,000/year\n\nYear 2: Another 200 rooms open, totaling 400 rooms.\nDaily Revenue Year 2 = 400 rooms \u00d7 $200/room \u00d7 70% = $56,000/day\nAnnual Revenue Year 2 = $56,000/day \u00d7 365 = $20,440,000/year\n\nYear 3: The final 200 rooms open, totaling 600 rooms.\nDaily Revenue Year 3 = 600 rooms \u00d7 $200/room \u00d7 70% = $84,000/day\nAnnual Revenue Year 3 = $84,000/day \u00d7 365 = $30,660,000/year\n\nSo, over the three years, the cumulative revenue would be:\n\nTotal Revenue over 3 years = $10,220,000 + $20,440,000 + $30,660,000 = $61,320,000\n\nBut, considering that the investment of $90 million is spread over three years, and revenue starts coming in incrementally, the hotel chain would need to factor in the time value of money and possibly consider financing options.\n\nAlternatively, if all hotels are opened at once at the end of three years, then the annual revenue would be $30.66 million starting from year 4.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify the timing of openings, I'll stick with the initial calculation of $30.66 million annual revenue once all new hotels are operational.\n\nIt's also worth considering other factors that could affect the investment decision, such as operating costs, maintenance, staffing, marketing, and potential changes in demand due to seasonal fluctuations or economic conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the hotel chain should consider the payback period, return on investment (ROI), and net present value (NPV) of this expansion project to determine its financial viability.\n\nFor instance, if we consider a simple payback period:\n\nPayback Period = Total Investment / Annual Revenue\nPayback Period = $90,000,000 / $30,660,000 \u2248 2.93 years\n\nSo, it would take approximately 2.93 years to recover the initial investment, assuming constant revenue and no costs. However, in reality, there would be ongoing operating costs, so the actual payback period might be longer.\n\nAdditionally, the hotel chain should consider the growth potential of the tourist destination, competition, and any regulatory or environmental factors that could impact the success of the new hotels.\n\nIn conclusion, the required investment for the expansion is $90 million, and the potential annual revenue is approximately $30.66 million, assuming an average daily rate of $200 and a 70% occupancy rate. The payback period is estimated to be around 2.93 years, but a more detailed financial analysis is recommended to make an informed decision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Total Investment: } \\$90,000,000 \\text{; Potential Annual Revenue: } \\$30,660,000}\\]"
