        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling from Town A to Town B, and the distance between them is 120 miles. The train has an original speed, which we need to find, and when its speed is increased by 20 mph, it takes 30 minutes less to complete the journey.\n\nFirst, let's denote the original speed of the train as \\( v \\) mph. The time it takes to travel 120 miles at this speed is \\( t \\) hours. We know that time is equal to distance divided by speed, so:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{120}{v} \\]\n\nNow, when the speed is increased by 20 mph, the new speed is \\( v + 20 \\) mph. The time taken at this new speed is:\n\n\\[ t - \\frac{30}{60} = t - 0.5 \\] hours (since 30 minutes is 0.5 hours)\n\nSo, the time at the increased speed is:\n\n\\[ t - 0.5 = \\frac{120}{v + 20} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{v} - 0.5 = \\frac{120}{v + 20} \\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( v \\). This looks a bit tricky because we have fractions and variables in the denominators. Maybe we can get rid of the denominators by multiplying both sides by \\( v(v + 20) \\), which is the least common multiple of the denominators.\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( v(v + 20) \\):\n\n\\[ 120(v + 20) - 0.5v(v + 20) = 120v \\]\n\nLet's expand the terms:\n\n\\[ 120v + 2400 - 0.5v^2 - 10v = 120v \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 120v + 2400 - 0.5v^2 - 10v - 120v = 0 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ -0.5v^2 - 10v + 2400 = 0 \\]\n\nTo make it easier, multiply both sides by -2 to eliminate the negative coefficient:\n\n\\[ v^2 + 20v - 4800 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the standard form: \\( v^2 + 20v - 4800 = 0 \\). We can solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 20 \\), and \\( c = -4800 \\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{20^2 - 4(1)(-4800)}}{2(1)} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 + 19200}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{19600}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{-20 \\pm 140}{2} \\]\n\nThis gives us two potential solutions:\n\n1. \\( v = \\frac{-20 + 140}{2} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60 \\) mph\n\n2. \\( v = \\frac{-20 - 140}{2} = \\frac{-160}{2} = -80 \\) mph\n\nSince speed cannot be negative, we discard \\( v = -80 \\) mph. Therefore, the original speed of the train is 60 mph.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this result to make sure it makes sense. If the original speed is 60 mph, then the time taken to travel 120 miles is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\] hours\n\nWhen the speed is increased by 20 mph, the new speed is 80 mph, and the time taken is:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{120}{80} = 1.5 \\] hours\n\nThe difference in time is:\n\n\\[ 2 - 1.5 = 0.5 \\] hours, which is indeed 30 minutes. So, our solution checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
