        "content": "If the Moon were just 100 feet closer to or further from the Earth, the impact would be negligible and practically unnoticeable. The distance between the Earth and the Moon is approximately 238,855 miles (about 1,245,080,640 feet), so a change of 100 feet is minuscule in comparison.\n\nTo put this into perspective, the Moon's distance from Earth varies naturally due to its elliptical orbit. At its closest point (perigee), it's about 225,623 miles away, and at its farthest point (apogee), it's about 252,088 miles away. This natural variation is over 26,000 miles, which is significantly larger than 100 feet.\n\nThe gravitational effects that cause tides on Earth are influenced by the Moon's distance. However, a change of 100 feet would result in an almost imperceptible change in tidal forces. The difference in gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon over that small distance change is negligible.\n\nIn summary, a 100-foot change in the Moon's distance from Earth would have no measurable impact on the Earth or its systems."
