        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a city with 25,000 households. Out of these, 60% have at least one pet. First, I need to find out how many households actually have pets.\n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 60% of 25,000. Percentage calculations are straightforward: you multiply the total number by the percentage in decimal form. So, 60% is 0.60 in decimal form.\n\nNumber of pet-owning households = 25,000 \u00d7 0.60\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n25,000 \u00d7 0.60 = 15,000 households\n\nSo, there are 15,000 households that have at least one pet.\n\nNext, we're told that 30% of these pet-owning households have more than one pet. I need to find out how many households have more than one pet and how many have just one pet, because to find the total number of pets, I'll need to account for both scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of households with more than one pet.\n\nNumber of households with more than one pet = 30% of 15,000\n\nAgain, converting percentage to decimal: 30% is 0.30.\n\nSo, 15,000 \u00d7 0.30 = 4,500 households\n\nTherefore, 4,500 households have more than one pet.\n\nNow, the remaining pet-owning households must have exactly one pet.\n\nNumber of households with exactly one pet = Total pet-owning households - Households with more than one pet\n\nWhich is 15,000 - 4,500 = 10,500 households\n\nSo, 10,500 households have one pet each, and 4,500 households have more than one pet.\n\nBut how many pets do these 4,500 households have in total? The problem says \"more than one pet,\" but it doesn't specify exactly how many. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to make an assumption here. If a household has more than one pet, let's assume that they have exactly two pets, unless specified otherwise. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should consider that they have an average number of pets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to interpret this without making additional assumptions.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can consider that the households with more than one pet have, on average, a certain number of pets, but without specific information, that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the minimum or maximum possible number of pets, but that seems unlikely. Maybe I need to find an expression for the total number of pets in terms of the average number of pets in households with more than one pet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that households with more than one pet have exactly two pets, which is a common scenario, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe I can think in terms of the total number of pets being the sum of pets in households with exactly one pet and pets in households with more than one pet.\n\nSo, total pets = (number of households with exactly one pet \u00d7 1) + (number of households with more than one pet \u00d7 average number of pets per such household)\n\nBut again, without knowing the average number of pets in households with more than one pet, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that households with more than one pet have exactly two pets. That would make the calculation straightforward.\n\nLet's consider that option.\n\nAssuming households with more than one pet have exactly two pets, then:\n\nPets in households with exactly one pet = 10,500 \u00d7 1 = 10,500 pets\n\nPets in households with more than one pet = 4,500 \u00d7 2 = 9,000 pets\n\nTotal pets = 10,500 + 9,000 = 19,500 pets\n\nBut is this a valid assumption? The problem says \"more than one pet,\" which includes two, three, four, etc. Assuming exactly two pets might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that 30% of pet-owning households have more than one pet, and the rest have exactly one pet, with no household having more than two pets. That would also lead to the same calculation as above.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify that households with more than one pet have exactly two pets. So, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider that households with more than one pet have an average of, say, X pets per household. Then, the total number of pets in these households would be 4,500 \u00d7 X.\n\nSimilarly, households with exactly one pet contribute 10,500 \u00d7 1 = 10,500 pets.\n\nTherefore, total pets = 10,500 + 4,500X\n\nBut without knowing X, I can't compute a numerical value for total pets.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate total pets in terms of X, but that seems unlikely for this type of problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to determine X from the given information, but I don't see it immediately.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can consider that the 30% of pet-owning households that have more than one pet compensate for the fact that some households have more than two pets.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for an overall average number of pets per household and multiply by the number of pet-owning households.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to approach it.\n\nFirst, find the average number of pets per pet-owning household, and then multiply that by the number of pet-owning households to get the total number of pets.\n\nTo find the average number of pets per pet-owning household, I need to know the total number of pets and divide it by the number of pet-owning households, but that's circular because that's what I'm trying to find.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the average in terms of the given percentages.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet A be the average number of pets in households with exactly one pet.\n\nLet B be the average number of pets in households with more than one pet.\n\nThen, the overall average number of pets per pet-owning household is:\n\nAverage = (A \u00d7 number of households with exactly one pet + B \u00d7 number of households with more than one pet) / total pet-owning households\n\nBut A is 1, since households with exactly one pet have one pet.\n\nB is the average number of pets in households with more than one pet, which is unknown.\n\nSo, Average = (1 \u00d7 10,500 + B \u00d7 4,500) / 15,000\n\nThis seems similar to what I had earlier.\n\nUnless there's additional information provided about the total number of pets or the average number of pets per household, I don't think I can solve for B.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that households with more than one pet have exactly two pets, making B = 2.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nAverage = (10,500 + 4,500 \u00d7 2) / 15,000 = (10,500 + 9,000) / 15,000 = 19,500 / 15,000 = 1.3 pets per pet-owning household\n\nThen, total pets = average \u00d7 number of pet-owning households = 1.3 \u00d7 15,000 = 19,500 pets\n\nBut again, I'm making an assumption here that may not be warranted by the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach altogether.\n\nLet me consider the total number of pets as the sum of pets in households with exactly one pet and pets in households with more than one pet.\n\nAs I did before:\n\nTotal pets = 10,500 \u00d7 1 + 4,500 \u00d7 B\n\nWhere B is the average number of pets in households with more than one pet.\n\nBut without knowing B, I can't find a numerical value for total pets.\n\nUnless, perhaps, there's a way to find B using the given percentages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem expects a simpler approach.\n\nLet me try another angle.\n\nFirst, 60% of 25,000 households have at least one pet, which is 15,000 households.\n\nOut of these 15,000, 30% have more than one pet, which is 4,500 households.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 15,000 - 4,500 = 10,500 households have exactly one pet.\n\nNow, the total number of pets is the number of households with exactly one pet plus the number of pets in households with more than one pet.\n\nSo, total pets = 10,500 + (number of pets in 4,500 households with more than one pet)\n\nBut without knowing how many pets each of these 4,500 households has, I can't compute the exact number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the 30% of pet-owning households that have more than one pet each have exactly two pets, making the calculation straightforward.\n\nIf that's the case, then total pets = 10,500 + 4,500 \u00d7 2 = 10,500 + 9,000 = 19,500 pets\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the 30% of pet-owning households that have more than one pet each have an average of two pets, leading to the same calculation.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify, I should consider if there's another way to interpret the information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the 30% of pet-owning households that have more than one pet account for a certain proportion of the total pets, but without additional information, that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard approach to such problems in statistics or probability, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo or is incomplete, as it seems insufficient information is provided to find a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the phrase \"more than one pet\" includes households with exactly two pets, exactly three pets, etc., and without knowing the distribution, I can't find a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the 30% of pet-owning households that have more than one pet each have exactly two pets, which is a common assumption in such problems.\n\nIf that's the case, then total pets = 10,500 (from households with one pet) + 9,000 (from households with two pets) = 19,500 pets\n\nAlternatively, if some households have more than two pets, then the total number of pets would be higher.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the expected answer is 19,500 pets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the given percentages that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the minimum possible number of pets, which would occur if households with more than one pet have exactly two pets.\n\nIn that case, total pets = 10,500 + 4,500 \u00d7 2 = 19,500 pets\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pets would be unbounded, as some households could have a very large number of pets.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting the minimum total, which is 19,500 pets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's additional information or context that I should be considering, but based on the given information, that seems to be the most reasonable approach.\n\nTherefore, I will go with the assumption that households with more than one pet have exactly two pets, leading to a total of 19,500 pets in the city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19500} \\]"
