        "content": "So the bakery is planning to open three new locations, each needing an initial investment of $100,000 for renovations and equipment. On top of that, there are monthly expenses of $10,000 for rent, utilities, and salaries. They expect to make $20,000 per month from each location. I need to find out when each location will break even, meaning when the total revenue equals the total investment plus ongoing expenses.\n\nFirst, let's understand what break-even point means. It's the point in time when the total revenue equals the total costs, which include both the initial investment and the ongoing monthly expenses. After that point, the location starts making a profit.\n\nSo, for each location:\n\n- Initial investment: $100,000\n\n- Monthly expenses: $10,000\n\n- Monthly revenue: $20,000\n\nTo find the break-even point in months, I need to calculate how many months it will take for the revenue to cover both the initial investment and the accumulating monthly expenses.\n\nLet's denote the number of months needed to break even as \"n.\"\n\nTotal cost after n months = initial investment + (monthly expenses * n)\n\nTotal revenue after n months = monthly revenue * n\n\nAt the break-even point, total revenue equals total cost:\n\nMonthly revenue * n = initial investment + (monthly expenses * n)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n$20,000 * n = $100,000 + ($10,000 * n)\n\nNow, I need to solve for n.\n\nFirst, subtract $10,000 * n from both sides:\n\n$20,000 * n - $10,000 * n = $100,000\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$10,000 * n = $100,000\n\nNow, divide both sides by $10,000:\n\nn = $100,000 / $10,000\n\nn = 10\n\nSo, the break-even point is 10 months for each new location.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal cost after 10 months:\n\nInitial investment: $100,000\n\nMonthly expenses for 10 months: $10,000 * 10 = $100,000\n\nTotal cost: $100,000 + $100,000 = $200,000\n\nTotal revenue after 10 months:\n\n$20,000 * 10 = $200,000\n\nYes, at 10 months, revenue equals total cost, so that's the break-even point.\n\nAlternatively, I could look at the monthly profit, which is revenue minus expenses.\n\nMonthly profit = $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000\n\nThen, to cover the initial investment of $100,000, it would take $100,000 / $10,000 = 10 months.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think this makes sense.\n\nNow, it's important to consider that this is a simplified calculation. In reality, there might be other factors to consider, such as:\n\n- Variability in monthly revenue: Maybe some months are busier than others.\n\n- Changes in expenses over time: Rent might increase, or utility costs could go up.\n\n- Financing costs: If the initial investment is borrowed, there would be interest to pay.\n\n- Marketing and promotion costs: To attract customers to new locations.\n\n- Potential for revenue growth: Maybe as the location becomes more established, revenue could increase.\n\nBut based on the information provided, the break-even point is 10 months for each new location.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
