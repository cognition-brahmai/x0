        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people in the room with an average age of 25 years. That means the total age of all 5 people together is 5 times 25, which is 125 years.\n\nNow, a sixth person enters the room, and the average age becomes 27 years. So, with 6 people in the room, the total age of all 6 people together is 6 times 27, which is 162 years.\n\nTo find out how old the sixth person is, we can subtract the total age of the original 5 people from the total age of all 6 people.\n\nSo, the sixth person's age is 162 years minus 125 years, which is 37 years.\n\nTherefore, the sixth person is 37 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37} \\]"
