The function's input could be either the user query, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nTools at disposal:\nYahooSearch[input]: This tool lets the user perform a search operation via Yahoo's search engine. It provides a list of potential sources that might contain the answer to the user's query.\nPageScraper[input]: This tool fetches the content of one or more webpages whose URLs are supplied as the input.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: This tool extracts hyperlinks from a given chunk of text.\nJARVIS[input]: An AI-based language model adept at answering queries given a context. The input should be a question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable, such as 'What is the capital of country Y, given :evidence1:?'.\n\nOutput Format:\nPlan: [Initial step based on the user query]\n:evidence0: = [Function invocation with suitable input]\nPlan: [Following step(s), depending upon the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function invocation with suitable input, potentially referring to prior evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: encapsulating the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book '1984' and what are his other notable works?"
