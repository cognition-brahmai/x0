        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about two trains moving towards each other from different stations. Station A and Station B are 420 miles apart. One train leaves Station A at 6:00 PM going east at 60 mph, and another train leaves Station B at 7:00 PM going west toward Station A at 80 mph. I need to find out when they will pass each other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Train A leaves Station A at 6:00 PM going east at 60 mph. Train B leaves Station B at 7:00 PM going west at 80 mph toward Station A. The distance between the stations is 420 miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly the distance between them is closing. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nBut, there's a tricky part here because Train B leaves an hour later than Train A. So, in that one hour, Train A has already covered some distance.\n\nLet me calculate how far Train A has traveled by the time Train B starts at 7:00 PM.\n\nTrain A's speed: 60 mph\n\nTime traveled before Train B starts: 1 hour\n\nDistance covered by Train A in that hour: 60 miles\n\nSo, at 7:00 PM, the remaining distance between the two trains is 420 miles - 60 miles = 360 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, starting at 7:00 PM, with a relative speed of 140 mph.\n\nI need to find the time it takes for them to cover the remaining 360 miles at 140 mph.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 360 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n360 divided by 140 is 36/14, which simplifies to 18/7, which is approximately 2.5714 hours.\n\nBut, it's better to keep it as a fraction for precision. So, 18/7 hours.\n\nNow, I need to convert that into hours and minutes.\n\n18/7 hours = 2 hours + (4/7) hours.\n\nNow, to convert 4/7 hours into minutes, since there are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\n(4/7) * 60 = 240/7 \u2248 34.2857 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes.\n\nSince both trains start moving towards each other at 7:00 PM, I need to add 2 hours and 34 minutes to 7:00 PM to find out when they pass each other.\n\n7:00 PM + 2 hours = 9:00 PM\n\n9:00 PM + 34 minutes = 9:34 PM\n\nTherefore, the trains will pass each other at approximately 9:34 PM.\n\nBut, let me double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, distance covered by Train A before Train B starts: 60 mph * 1 hour = 60 miles.\n\nRemaining distance: 420 - 60 = 360 miles.\n\nRelative speed: 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nTime to cover 360 miles at 140 mph: 360 / 140 = 18/7 hours \u2248 2.5714 hours = 2 hours and 34 minutes.\n\nAdding that to 7:00 PM: 7:00 PM + 2 hours 34 minutes = 9:34 PM.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the problem considering the time after 6:00 PM.\n\nLet\u2019s denote t as the time in hours after 6:00 PM.\n\nThen, Train A has traveled t hours, and Train B has traveled (t - 1) hours (since it starts at 7:00 PM, one hour later).\n\nThe distance covered by Train A: 60t miles\n\nThe distance covered by Train B: 80(t - 1) miles\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances should be equal to the initial distance between the stations: 420 miles.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n60t + 80(t - 1) = 420\n\nLet me solve for t:\n\n60t + 80t - 80 = 420\n\n140t - 80 = 420\n\n140t = 420 + 80\n\n140t = 500\n\nt = 500 / 140\n\nt = 50 / 14\n\nt = 25 / 7 hours \u2248 3.5714 hours\n\nNow, 25/7 hours is approximately 3 hours and 34 minutes (since 3 hours is 21/7, and 4/7 hours is about 34 minutes).\n\nSo, 6:00 PM + 3 hours 34 minutes = 9:34 PM\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the trains will pass each other at 9:34 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9:34 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
