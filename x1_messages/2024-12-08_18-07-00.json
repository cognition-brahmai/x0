        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a shipping company that needs to transport 10,000 packages from one city to another. Each truck can carry up to 500 packages. First, I need to figure out how many trucks are required to carry all these packages.\n\nTo find the number of trucks needed, I'll divide the total number of packages by the capacity of each truck. So, that's 10,000 packages divided by 500 packages per truck. Let's do the math:\n\n10,000 \u00f7 500 = 20 trucks\n\nSo, they need 20 trucks to transport all the packages.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total fuel cost for the entire fleet. To do that, I need to know how much fuel each truck will consume for the trip and then multiply that by the number of trucks and the cost of diesel per gallon.\n\nFirst, let's find out the fuel consumption for one truck. The distance between the cities is 800 miles, and each truck has a fuel consumption rate of 7 miles per gallon. So, the amount of fuel one truck needs is:\n\nFuel per truck = distance \u00f7 fuel consumption rate\nFuel per truck = 800 miles \u00f7 7 miles per gallon\nFuel per truck \u2248 114.286 gallons\n\nNow, diesel costs $4 per gallon, so the fuel cost for one truck is:\n\nCost per truck = fuel per truck \u00d7 cost per gallon\nCost per truck \u2248 114.286 gallons \u00d7 $4/gallon\nCost per truck \u2248 $457.142\n\nSince there are 20 trucks, the total fuel cost for the entire fleet would be:\n\nTotal fuel cost = cost per truck \u00d7 number of trucks\nTotal fuel cost \u2248 $457.142 \u00d7 20\nTotal fuel cost \u2248 $9,142.84\n\nBut let's double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, number of trucks:\n\n10,000 packages \u00f7 500 packages/truck = 20 trucks\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, fuel consumption per truck:\n\n800 miles \u00f7 7 miles/gallon \u2248 114.286 gallons\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nThen, cost per truck:\n\n114.286 gallons \u00d7 $4/gallon = $457.144\n\nActually, more precisely, 114.2857 gallons \u00d7 $4 = $457.1428, which rounds to $457.14\n\nAnd for 20 trucks:\n\n20 \u00d7 $457.14 = $9,142.80\n\nSo, the total fuel cost is approximately $9,142.80.\n\nWait a minute, but in my initial calculation, I had $9,142.84. There's a slight discrepancy here. Let me recalculate.\n\nFirst, fuel per truck:\n\n800 \u00f7 7 = approximately 114.2857 gallons\n\nCost per truck: 114.2857 \u00d7 4 = 457.1428 dollars\n\nFor 20 trucks: 457.1428 \u00d7 20 = 9,142.856 dollars\n\nSo, rounding to two decimal places, it's $9,142.86\n\nI think the discrepancy is due to rounding at intermediate steps. To be more accurate, I should avoid rounding until the final step.\n\nLet me do the calculations again without rounding intermediate values.\n\nFirst, exact fuel per truck:\n\n800 miles \u00f7 7 miles/gallon = 800/7 gallons \u2248 114.285714 gallons\n\nCost per truck: 114.285714 gallons \u00d7 $4/gallon = $457.142856\n\nTotal fuel cost for 20 trucks: 20 \u00d7 $457.142856 = $9,142.85712\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this is $9,142.86\n\nSo, the total fuel cost is $9,142.86\n\nAlternatively, I can do it in a single formula:\n\nTotal fuel cost = (total packages / packages per truck) \u00d7 (distance / fuel consumption rate) \u00d7 cost per gallon\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal fuel cost = (10,000 / 500) \u00d7 (800 / 7) \u00d7 4\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n10,000 / 500 = 20\n\n800 / 7 \u2248 114.2857\n\n20 \u00d7 114.2857 \u2248 2,285.7142\n\n2,285.7142 \u00d7 4 \u2248 9,142.856\n\nAgain, rounding to two decimal places, $9,142.86\n\nSo, the number of trucks needed is 20, and the total fuel cost is approximately $9,142.86\n\nBut perhaps I should consider that each truck makes only one trip, and if the distance is 800 miles, that's a one-way distance. So, does the truck need to return? If it does, then the total distance per truck would be 1,600 miles round trip.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify if the trucks need to return, but since it's a shipping company transporting packages from one city to another, it's possible that the trucks are making a one-way trip and will return empty or with other cargo later. However, the problem doesn't provide information about return trips, so I think it's safe to assume that we're only considering the one-way trip for this calculation.\n\nAdditionally, fuel consumption is given in miles per gallon, and the cost is per gallon, so as long as we have the distance and fuel consumption rate, we can calculate the fuel needed.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the trucks are fully loaded. Since each truck can carry up to 500 packages, and we have exactly 10,000 packages, which requires 20 trucks, each truck is fully loaded.\n\nIf there were fewer packages, some trucks might not be fully loaded, but in this case, all trucks are at full capacity.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any constraints on the number of trucks available or any other factors that might affect the transportation plan, so I'll proceed with the assumption that 20 trucks are available and can be used for this shipment.\n\nIn summary, the shipping company needs 20 trucks to transport 10,000 packages, and the total fuel cost for the entire fleet to travel 800 miles, given a fuel consumption rate of 7 miles per gallon and diesel costing $4 per gallon, is approximately $9,142.86\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe number of trucks needed is \\boxed{20}, and the total fuel cost is \\boxed{9142.86} dollars."
