        "content": "Photosynthesis primarily occurs in the leaves of plants, specifically within cells containing chloroplasts. The leaves are designed to maximize exposure to sunlight, which is essential for this process. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, the green pigment that captures light energy. This energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, which are vital for the plant's growth and survival."
