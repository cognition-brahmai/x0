        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression I need to calculate is ((7 * 8) / 2)^2 - 15. Okay, so first things first, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses: (7 * 8). That's 56. Now, that result needs to be divided by 2, so 56 / 2 is 28. Next, I need to raise that result to the power of 2, which means 28 squared. 28 squared is 784. Finally, I subtract 15 from 784, which gives me 769.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can do it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with (7 * 8), which is indeed 56. Then, 56 divided by 2 is 28. 28 squared is 784. And 784 minus 15 is 769. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the expression differently. Maybe there's another way to approach it that might make it easier or confirm my answer. For example, I could consider the division by 2 as multiplying by 1/2, so (7 * 8 * 1/2)^2 - 15. That simplifies to (7 * 4)^2 - 15, which is (28)^2 - 15, and again, 784 - 15 = 769. Okay, that matches my first result.\n\nLet me try another approach. What if I consider the multiplication and division first altogether? So, 7 * 8 is 56, divided by 2 is 28, and then squared is 784, minus 15 is 769. Hmm, same answer again.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can plug in the numbers step by step:\n\n1. Calculate 7 * 8: 56\n\n2. Divide that by 2: 56 / 2 = 28\n\n3. Square the result: 28^2 = 784\n\n4. Subtract 15: 784 - 15 = 769\n\nEverything checks out. I think 769 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there are any other interpretations of the expression. For example, could the exponent apply only to the division and not the multiplication? Like, is it ((7 * 8) / 2)^2 - 15 or (7 * 8) / (2^2) - 15? But no, the expression clearly has the division by 2 before the exponentiation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the order of operations. Exponents are after parentheses and before multiplication and division. So, in this case, after resolving the parentheses, the exponentiation comes next.\n\nLet me see if I can verify this with a different method. Suppose I use the formula for (a * b / c)^2. That's equal to (a * b)^2 / c^2. So, in this case, a is 7, b is 8, and c is 2. So, (7 * 8)^2 / 2^2 - 15. That's 56^2 / 4 - 15. 56 squared is 3136, divided by 4 is 784, minus 15 is 769. Again, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as (7 / 2 * 8)^2 - 15. But according to order of operations, multiplication and division are equal in precedence and are performed from left to right. So, 7 divided by 2 is 3.5, multiplied by 8 is 28, squared is 784, minus 15 is 769. Still the same result.\n\nMaybe I can try calculating it on a calculator to confirm. Let's see, first, 7 times 8 is 56. Then, 56 divided by 2 is 28. 28 squared is 784. 784 minus 15 is 769. Yep.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of fractions, 7 * 8 is 56, divided by 2 is 28, which is the same as 56/2, and then squared is (56/2)^2 = (28)^2 = 784, minus 15 is 769.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 769.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there are any possible misinterpretations of the expression due to parentheses. The expression is ((7 * 8) / 2)^2 - 15. The innermost parentheses are (7 * 8), which is 56. Then, 56 / 2 is 28. Then, that result is squared, and finally, 15 is subtracted. There don't seem to be any other ways to interpret the parentheses.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I can expand the expression using algebraic identities. But given that it's a straightforward arithmetic expression, I don't think that's necessary. It's already clear from the order of operations how to proceed.\n\nIn conclusion, the result of ((7 * 8) / 2)^2 - 15 is 769.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{769} \\]"
