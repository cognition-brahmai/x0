Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what simple interest means. Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount, which in this case is $5,000. It doesn't take into account any interest that is added to the principal over time. So, the interest each year is always based on the initial amount.\n\nThe formula for simple interest is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Simple Interest} = P \\times r \\times t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount ($5,000)\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (3%, which as a decimal is 0.03)\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years (4 years)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Simple Interest} = 5000 \\times 0.03 \\times 4 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\( 5000 \\times 0.03 = 150 \\). That's the interest earned in one year.\n\nThen, \\( 150 \\times 4 = 600 \\). So, over 4 years, you'll earn $600 in interest.\n\nNow, to find the total amount in the account after 4 years, you add the interest to the principal:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Amount} = P + \\text{Simple Interest} = 5000 + 600 = 5600 \\]\n\nTherefore, after 4 years, you'll have $5,600 in the account.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm using the correct formula because sometimes people get confused between simple interest and compound interest.\n\nCompound interest is when the interest is added to the principal at the end of each period, and the next period's interest is calculated on the new amount. But in this case, since it's specified as simple interest, I'm correct in using the simple interest formula.\n\nAnother way to think about simple interest is that it's a fixed percentage of the principal each year. So, 3% of $5,000 is $150 per year. Over 4 years, that's $150 x 4 = $600, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if this were compound interest. For compound interest, the formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\times (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nUsing the same values:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times (1 + 0.03)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times (1.03)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.12550881 \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 5627.54 \\]\n\nSo, with compound interest, you'd have approximately $5,627.54 after 4 years. But since the problem specifies simple interest, the correct answer is $5,600.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in real-world savings accounts, interest is usually compounded, often daily or monthly, which would result in a slightly higher final amount than simple interest. However, according to the problem, we're to assume simple interest.\n\nLet me also consider if there are any other factors that might affect the calculation, such as taxes or fees, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I'll ignore those for this calculation.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that the interest rate is indeed an annual rate and not a nominal rate that might be compounded more frequently, but again, the problem specifies simple interest, so it's straightforward.\n\nJust to summarize, with simple interest:\n\n- Principal (P): $5,000\n\n- Annual interest rate (r): 3% or 0.03\n\n- Time (t): 4 years\n\n- Simple Interest (I): P * r * t = 5000 * 0.03 * 4 = $600\n\n- Total Amount (A): P + I = 5000 + 600 = $5,600\n\nSo, after 4 years, the account will have $5,600.\n\nI think that's clear, but let me try to explain it in another way. Each year, the interest earned is 3% of $5,000, which is $150. So, for 4 years, it's $150 per year multiplied by 4, which is $600. Adding that to the original $5,000 gives $5,600.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of the total interest earned over 4 years as a single calculation: $5,000 multiplied by 3% multiplied by 4 years, which again is $600.\n\nIn any case, the final amount is $5,600.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5600} \\]"
