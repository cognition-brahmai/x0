        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular garden that's currently 12 meters long and 8 meters wide. So, the first thing I need to do is figure out the current area of the garden.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, right? So, the current area is 12 meters * 8 meters = 96 square meters.\n\nNow, the task is to increase this area by 50%. To find out what 50% of the current area is, I can calculate 50% of 96 square meters. That would be 0.5 * 96 = 48 square meters.\n\nSo, to increase the area by 50%, the new area should be the original area plus this increase: 96 square meters + 48 square meters = 144 square meters.\n\nThe question is, what should the new dimensions be to achieve this new area of 144 square meters, while keeping the shape rectangular?\n\nBut here's a thing: there are infinite pairs of length and width that can give an area of 144 square meters, as long as their product is 144. For example, 12 meters by 12 meters, or 18 meters by 8 meters, etc.\n\nHowever, I think the problem might be expecting us to maintain the same shape, meaning keeping the same ratio of length to width. Does that make sense?\n\nLet me check. The original dimensions are 12 meters by 8 meters. So, the ratio of length to width is 12:8, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nIf we want to maintain that same shape, the new dimensions should also have a 3:2 ratio.\n\nSo, let's assume the new length is 3x meters and the new width is 2x meters, where x is a scaling factor.\n\nThe area of the new rectangle would be (3x) * (2x) = 6x^2 square meters.\n\nWe know this new area should be 144 square meters, so we can set up the equation:\n\n6x^2 = 144\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nx^2 = 24\n\nThen, take the square root of both sides:\n\nx = sqrt(24) = sqrt(4*6) = 2*sqrt(6)\n\nSo, x is approximately 2 * 2.45 = 4.90 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new length is 3x = 3 * 4.90 \u2248 14.70 meters, and the new width is 2x = 2 * 4.90 \u2248 9.80 meters.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this makes sense.\n\nOriginal area: 12 * 8 = 96 sq.m\n\nNew area: 14.70 * 9.80 \u2248 144.06 sq.m, which is approximately 144 sq.m, as required.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps we can consider increasing either the length or the width by a certain factor to achieve the 50% area increase.\n\nLet's say we keep the width the same at 8 meters and increase the length. Let the new length be L meters.\n\nThen, the new area would be L * 8 = 144\n\nSo, L = 144 / 8 = 18 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if we keep the length the same at 12 meters and increase the width, let the new width be W meters.\n\nThen, the new area would be 12 * W = 144\n\nSo, W = 144 / 12 = 12 meters.\n\nSo, depending on which dimension we choose to change, we can either have a length of 18 meters and width of 8 meters, or length of 12 meters and width of 12 meters.\n\nBut the problem says \"maintaining its rectangular shape.\" Does this mean keeping the same aspect ratio, or just keeping it a rectangle without specifying the ratio?\n\nI think it's ambiguous. Earlier, I assumed keeping the same aspect ratio, but now it seems like perhaps we can choose to keep one dimension constant and change the other.\n\nMaybe the problem allows for any rectangular shape as long as the area is increased by 50%.\n\nIn that case, there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Length: 18 meters, Width: 8 meters\n\n- Length: 12 meters, Width: 12 meters\n\n- Length: 16 meters, Width: 9 meters (since 16*9=144)\n\n- Length: 24 meters, Width: 6 meters\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAlternatively, if we are to maintain the same aspect ratio, then the dimensions would be in the same ratio as before, which we calculated as approximately 14.70 meters by 9.80 meters.\n\nI think the problem is a bit unclear on whether the shape should mean keeping the same aspect ratio or just maintaining a rectangular form.\n\nPerhaps the intended interpretation is to keep the same shape, meaning the same aspect ratio.\n\nIn that case, the new dimensions should be 14.70 meters by 9.80 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for any rectangular shape, in which case there are multiple possible answers.\n\nTo be safe, maybe I should provide both options.\n\nFirst, keeping the same aspect ratio:\n\nNew dimensions: approximately 14.70 meters by 9.80 meters.\n\nSecond, if we can change the aspect ratio:\n\n- Length: 18 meters, Width: 8 meters\n\n- Length: 12 meters, Width: 12 meters\n\n- Length: 16 meters, Width: 9 meters\n\n- Length: 24 meters, Width: 6 meters\n\nAnd so on, as long as the product of length and width is 144 square meters.\n\nI think that covers all possibilities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{New dimensions: approximately } 14.70 \\text{ meters by } 9.80 \\text{ meters, or any other combination where length} \\times \\text{width} = 144 \\text{ square meters}} \\]"
