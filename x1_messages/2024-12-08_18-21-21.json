        "content": "So, there's this ice cream shop that sells 6 different flavors of ice cream and offers 3 types of cones. The question is, how many different single-scoop ice cream cone options does a customer have? And I need to include my reasoning.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, there are 6 flavors and 3 types of cones. Each ice cream cone consists of one flavor scooped into one type of cone. So, for each flavor, there are 3 possible cones to choose from.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I list out the flavors: let's say they are vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mint, coffee, and butter pecan. And the cones are, maybe, waffle, sugar, and cake cones.\n\nSo, for vanilla, you can have it in a waffle cone, a sugar cone, or a cake cone. That's 3 options just for vanilla. Similarly, for chocolate, you can have it in a waffle, sugar, or cake cone, another 3 options. This pattern continues for each flavor.\n\nSo, for each of the 6 flavors, there are 3 cone options. To find the total number of different single-scoop ice cream cone options, I think I need to multiply the number of flavors by the number of cone types.\n\nSo, that would be 6 flavors times 3 cones, which equals 18 different options.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to approach this? Maybe using combinations or permutations. But since the order doesn't matter here\u2014like, choosing a flavor and then a cone, it's not like the sequence matters. It's just a combination of one flavor and one cone type.\n\nI think multiplication is the right approach here. It's a basic principle of counting: if there are m ways to do one thing, and n ways to do another, then there are m times n ways to do both.\n\nIn this case, m is 6 (flavors), and n is 3 (cones), so 6 times 3 is 18.\n\nLet me double-check. Suppose I list them all out:\n\n1. Vanilla in waffle cone\n\n2. Vanilla in sugar cone\n\n3. Vanilla in cake cone\n\n4. Chocolate in waffle cone\n\n5. Chocolate in sugar cone\n\n6. Chocolate in cake cone\n\n7. Strawberry in waffle cone\n\n8. Strawberry in sugar cone\n\n9. Strawberry in cake cone\n\n10. Mint in waffle cone\n\n11. Mint in sugar cone\n\n12. Mint in cake cone\n\n13. Coffee in waffle cone\n\n14. Coffee in sugar cone\n\n15. Coffee in cake cone\n\n16. Butter pecan in waffle cone\n\n17. Butter pecan in sugar cone\n\n18. Butter pecan in cake cone\n\nYes, that's 18 different options.\n\nI don't think there's any overlap or any options I'm missing. Each flavor is paired with each type of cone exactly once.\n\nSo, the final answer is 18 different single-scoop ice cream cone options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
