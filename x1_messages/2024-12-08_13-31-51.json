        "content": "I'm going to tackle this public transportation planning problem step by step. So, the city has a budget of $500 million to build a new transportation system using buses and trains. Each bus costs $300,000 and each train costs $2 million. The goal is to make sure that at least 60% of the population can access public transportation within a 10-minute walk. I need to figure out the optimal number of buses and trains to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"optimal\" means in this context. Typically, optimal could mean maximizing the number of people served within the budget, or maybe minimizing cost while meeting the 60% coverage goal. Since the problem says \"optimal,\" I'll assume it means maximizing coverage within the budget constraints.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"calculate the optimal number of buses and trains required to achieve this goal,\" implying that the primary objective is to meet the 60% coverage, and within that, find the best combination of buses and trains that fits the budget.\n\nHowever, to properly optimize this, I think I need to define an objective function, perhaps minimizing cost while ensuring that at least 60% of the population has access within 10 minutes, or maximizing coverage given the budget.\n\nBut since the problem specifies calculating the \"optimal number\" to achieve the 60% coverage, I'll approach it by trying to meet that coverage goal in the most cost-effective way possible.\n\nLet me start by gathering all the information provided:\n\n- Total budget: $500 million\n\n- Cost per bus: $300,000\n\n- Cost per train: $2 million\n\n- At least 60% of the population should have access to public transportation within a 10-minute walk.\n\nAdditional factors to consider:\n\n- Population distribution\n\n- Average walking speed\n\n- Distance between stops\n\nUnfortunately, specific data about the city's population distribution, average walking speed, and distance between stops aren't provided. I'll need to make some assumptions here.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total population of the city to determine what 60% of the population is. Since that's not provided, I'll have to represent it with a variable. Let's say the total population is P. Therefore, 60% of P is 0.6P.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how many people each bus or train can serve within a 10-minute walking distance.\n\nTo do that, I need to know:\n\n1. The walking speed to determine the radius within which people can walk to a stop in 10 minutes.\n\n2. The area covered by each stop based on that radius.\n\n3. How many stops are needed to cover the required population.\n\nBut hold on, this seems complicated because it involves spatial distribution, which isn't specified. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of coverage per bus and per train. Let's assume that each bus route or train line serves a certain number of people.\n\nHowever, without specific data on population density and the layout of the city, it's challenging to calculate exact numbers.\n\nMaybe I can consider that buses are more flexible and can cover smaller areas, while trains cover larger areas but are more expensive.\n\nGiven that, perhaps buses are more efficient in terms of cost per person served in denser areas, while trains are better for broader coverage in less dense areas.\n\nBut again, without specific data, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up a mathematical model where I define variables for the number of buses and trains, and then set up equations based on the budget and the coverage.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nLet:\n\n- B = number of buses\n\n- T = number of trains\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. Budget constraint: 300,000B + 2,000,000T \u2264 500,000,000\n\n2. Coverage constraint: The total coverage provided by buses and trains should be at least 0.6P\n\nBut I need to know how much coverage each bus and each train provides.\n\nLet's assume that each bus can serve a certain number of people, say C_b, and each train can serve C_t people.\n\nThen, the coverage constraint becomes: C_b * B + C_t * T \u2265 0.6P\n\nThe objective is to minimize cost while meeting the coverage constraint, or vice versa.\n\nBut I don't have values for C_b and C_t.\n\nPerhaps I need to find a relationship between the number of buses/trains and the population coverage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look into the walking distance.\n\nGiven that people can walk within a 10-minute walk to a stop, and assuming an average walking speed, I can calculate the walking radius.\n\nLet's assume an average walking speed of 5 km/h, which is about 0.0833 km/min. Therefore, in 10 minutes, people can walk 0.833 km or 833 meters.\n\nSo, the walking radius is 833 meters.\n\nNow, if I consider each stop (bus or train) to have a coverage area around it within 833 meters.\n\nBut to calculate the area covered by each stop, I need to know the layout of the city. Is it grid-like, or more random?\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that the city is relatively compact, and stops are distributed in a way that their coverage areas don't completely overlap.\n\nThen, the total coverage area is approximately the sum of the areas each stop covers.\n\nThe area covered by each stop is a circle with a radius of 833 meters, so area = \u03c0 * (833)^2 \u2248 2,164,685 square meters per stop.\n\nBut I need to know the population density to determine how many people are within each coverage area.\n\nLet\u2019s denote population density as D people per square meter.\n\nThen, the number of people covered by one stop is approximately D * 2,164,685.\n\nBut population density is usually expressed in people per square kilometer. There are 1,000,000 square meters in a square kilometer.\n\nSo, if D is in people per square kilometer, then the number of people per stop is D * 2.164685.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me recast this.\n\nIf D is population density in people per square kilometer, then the area covered by one stop is 2.164685 million square meters, which is 2.164685 square kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the number of people covered by one stop is D * 2.164685.\n\nBut I need to be careful with units here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of stops per person, but that seems inefficient.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to consider the number of stops needed to cover the required population.\n\nLet\u2019s say that each stop can cover a certain number of people, based on the population density and the coverage area.\n\nIf I denote the number of people per stop as C, then C = D * area per stop.\n\nBut without knowing D, this is still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the total number of stops needed is proportional to the population divided by the number of people each stop can cover.\n\nSo, total stops required = P / C\n\nBut again, without knowing C, this doesn't help.\n\nMaybe I need to make an assumption about the average number of people each stop can serve.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look into the ratio of the costs of buses to trains and their respective coverages.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the cost per unit coverage.\n\nIf I can find the cost per person covered for buses and for trains, then I can determine which one is more cost-effective and allocate accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Cost per person for buses: cost per bus / number of people per bus stop = 300,000 / C_b\n\n- Cost per person for trains: 2,000,000 / C_t\n\nThen, to minimize cost, I should prioritize the mode with the lower cost per person.\n\nBut again, without knowing C_b and C_t, this is not feasible.\n\nPerhaps I need to make some assumptions about C_b and C_t based on typical values.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that a bus stop can serve, say, 1,000 people, and a train station can serve 5,000 people.\n\nThese are just guesses, as actual numbers would depend on the specific context.\n\nThen:\n\n- Cost per person for buses: 300,000 / 1,000 = $300 per person\n\n- Cost per person for trains: 2,000,000 / 5,000 = $400 per person\n\nSo, buses are more cost-effective per person served.\n\nTherefore, to minimize cost, I should maximize the number of buses.\n\nBut wait, maybe trains can serve more people per stop, so overall, they might be more efficient.\n\nLet me check the total cost for serving the required population.\n\nTotal population to be covered: 0.6P\n\nIf I use only buses:\n\nNumber of buses needed: (0.6P) / 1,000\n\nTotal cost: [(0.6P)/1,000] * 300,000 = 0.6P * 300 = $180P\n\nSimilarly, if I use only trains:\n\nNumber of trains needed: (0.6P)/5,000\n\nTotal cost: [(0.6P)/5,000] * 2,000,000 = 0.6P * 400 = $240P\n\nSo, using only buses is cheaper than using only trains to cover the same population.\n\nTherefore, to minimize cost, it's better to use only buses.\n\nBut the city has a budget of $500 million, so I need to see how many buses I can buy with that budget.\n\nNumber of buses possible: 500,000,000 / 300,000 \u2248 1,666.67\n\nSo, maximum number of buses: 1,666\n\nCorresponding coverage: 1,666 * 1,000 = 1,666,000 people\n\nSimilarly, for trains:\n\nNumber of trains possible: 500,000,000 / 2,000,000 = 250\n\nCoverage: 250 * 5,000 = 1,250,000 people\n\nSo, with the entire budget spent on buses, I can cover 1,666,000 people, and with trains, 1,250,000 people.\n\nBut the required coverage is 0.6P.\n\nIf 0.6P is less than or equal to 1,250,000, then I can meet the goal with either mode.\n\nIf 0.6P is between 1,250,000 and 1,666,000, I need a combination.\n\nIf 0.6P is more than 1,666,000, then I can't meet the goal with the given budget.\n\nBut since I don't know P, I can't determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to find the maximum coverage possible within the budget.\n\nBut the problem specifies achieving at least 60% coverage, so I need to ensure that the combination of buses and trains can cover at least that.\n\nGiven that, and considering that buses are more cost-effective per person covered, the optimal strategy would be to spend the entire budget on buses to maximize the number of people covered.\n\nHowever, there might be other factors to consider, such as the capacity of buses versus trains, the frequency of service, and the ability to handle passenger volume.\n\nAdditionally, trains might have higher capacity and longer range, which could make them more suitable for certain areas.\n\nBut based solely on the cost per person covered, buses are more efficient in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, to minimize cost while meeting the coverage goal, I should buy as many buses as possible within the budget.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the number of buses needed to cover 0.6P people.\n\nNumber of buses required: ceil(0.6P / 1,000)\n\nCost: 300,000 * ceil(0.6P / 1,000)\n\nSimilarly, for trains:\n\nNumber of trains required: ceil(0.6P / 5,000)\n\nCost: 2,000,000 * ceil(0.6P / 5,000)\n\nBut again, without knowing P, I can't compute exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the number of buses and trains in terms of P.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- B: number of buses\n\n- T: number of trains\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. 300,000B + 2,000,000T \u2264 500,000,000\n\n2. 1,000B + 5,000T \u2265 0.6P\n\nAssuming C_b = 1,000 and C_t = 5,000 as before.\n\nThe objective is to minimize cost while meeting the coverage constraint.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem.\n\nTo solve it, I can use the method of minimizing the cost function subject to the constraints.\n\nBut since it's a linear problem with two variables, I can also solve it graphically or by considering the ratio of cost effectiveness.\n\nLet\u2019s find the cost per unit coverage for each mode.\n\nFor buses:\n\nCost per thousand people covered: 300,000 / 1,000 = $300\n\nFor trains:\n\nCost per thousand people covered: 2,000,000 / 5,000 = $400\n\nSo, buses are cheaper per thousand people covered.\n\nTherefore, to minimize cost, I should prioritize buying buses until the marginal cost of covering additional people with buses exceeds that of trains.\n\nIn this case, since buses are always cheaper per thousand people covered, it's optimal to buy as many buses as possible within the budget to cover the required population.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to buy only buses to cover the required 0.6P people, as long as the budget allows it.\n\nLet\u2019s check if the budget allows for that.\n\nNumber of buses needed: ceil(0.6P / 1,000)\n\nTotal cost: 300,000 * ceil(0.6P / 1,000)\n\nThis cost should be less than or equal to $500 million.\n\nSo, 300,000 * (0.6P / 1,000) \u2264 500,000,000\n\nSimplifying:\n\n300,000 * 0.6P / 1,000 \u2264 500,000,000\n\n300,000 * 0.6P \u2264 500,000,000 * 1,000\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\n300,000 * (0.6P / 1,000) = 300,000 * 0.6P / 1,000 = 300 * 0.6P = 180P\n\nSo, 180P \u2264 500,000,000\n\nTherefore, P \u2264 500,000,000 / 180 \u2248 2,777,777.78\n\nSo, if the city's population P is less than or equal to approximately 2,777,778, then buying only buses will cover 60% of the population within the budget.\n\nIf P is larger than that, then I need to consider using trains as well, or perhaps the budget is insufficient to cover 60% of the population.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the population, I need to consider both scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city's population is such that 60% corresponds to a certain number of people that requires a combination of buses and trains.\n\nGiven that, maybe I need to find a combination of buses and trains that maximizes coverage within the budget, but the problem seems to suggest finding the optimal numbers to meet exactly 60% coverage.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing without specific population data.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that both buses and trains can serve overlapping areas, but trains can serve more people due to higher capacity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trains serve longer distances, and buses serve shorter distances.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to model this accurately.\n\nMaybe I should consider the cost-effectiveness ratio of buses versus trains.\n\nAs calculated earlier, buses are more cost-effective per person covered.\n\nTherefore, in an optimal scenario, the city should purchase only buses to cover the required population, as long as the budget allows.\n\nIf the budget is insufficient to cover the required population with buses alone, then the city may need to supplement with trains.\n\nBut in this case, with a $500 million budget and buses costing $300,000 each, the city can buy up to 1,666 buses, covering up to 1,666,000 people.\n\nIf 60% of the population is less than or equal to that number, then buying only buses is optimal.\n\nIf 60% of the population exceeds that, then the city needs to buy some trains as well.\n\nBut without knowing the population, I can't determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city has a known population, and I need to calculate based on that.\n\nSince the population isn't specified, maybe I need to express the answer in terms of the population.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the population as P.\n\nThen, 60% of P is 0.6P.\n\nAssuming each bus covers 1,000 people and each train covers 5,000 people, as previously assumed.\n\nThen, the coverage equation is:\n\n1,000B + 5,000T \u2265 0.6P\n\nAnd the budget constraint is:\n\n300,000B + 2,000,000T \u2264 500,000,000\n\nTo minimize cost, we should maximize the use of buses, since they are cheaper per person covered.\n\nTherefore, buy as many buses as possible within the budget, up to the point where the required coverage is met.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the maximum number of buses that can be bought with $500 million:\n\nMax B = floor(500,000,000 / 300,000) = floor(1,666.666...) = 1,666 buses\n\nCoverage provided by 1,666 buses: 1,666 * 1,000 = 1,666,000 people\n\nSo, if 0.6P \u2264 1,666,000, then buy 1,666 buses.\n\nIf 0.6P > 1,666,000, then buy 1,666 buses and use the remaining budget for trains.\n\nBut first, let's calculate the cost of 1,666 buses:\n\n1,666 * 300,000 = 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - wait, actually, 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - but 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - but 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - wait, actually, 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - but 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - but 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000\n\nWait, hold on.\n\n1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - but actually, 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - but 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000 - but 1,666 * 300,000 = 500,000,000\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's calculate it properly.\n\n300,000 * 1,666 = 300,000 * 1,666 = 499,800,000\n\nSo, 1,666 buses cost $499,800,000, leaving $200,000 remaining.\n\nSo, with 1,666 buses, the city can cover 1,666,000 people, and have $200,000 left.\n\nIf 0.6P \u2264 1,666,000, then buy 1,666 buses.\n\nIf 0.6P > 1,666,000, then buy 1,666 buses and use the remaining budget for trains.\n\nBut $200,000 is not enough to buy another train, which costs $2,000,000.\n\nTherefore, if 0.6P > 1,666,000, the city cannot fully cover 60% of the population with the given budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city can buy fewer buses and use some of the budget for trains to cover more people per stop.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that.\n\nSuppose the city buys B buses and T trains, such that:\n\n300,000B + 2,000,000T \u2264 500,000,000\n\nAnd\n\n1,000B + 5,000T \u2265 0.6P\n\nWe need to find the values of B and T that satisfy these inequalities.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, and the optimal solution would be at one of the corners of the feasible region.\n\nLet\u2019s find the corner points.\n\nFirst, find the maximum number of buses: B_max = floor(500,000,000 / 300,000) = 1,666\n\nCorresponding coverage: 1,666 * 1,000 = 1,666,000\n\nSecond, find the maximum number of trains: T_max = floor(500,000,000 / 2,000,000) = 250\n\nCorresponding coverage: 250 * 5,000 = 1,250,000\n\nThird, find a combination of buses and trains that meets the coverage exactly.\n\nLet\u2019s solve the system of equations:\n\n300,000B + 2,000,000T = 500,000,000\n\n1,000B + 5,000T = 0.6P\n\nLet\u2019s simplify these equations.\n\nDivide the first equation by 100,000:\n\n3B + 20T = 5,000\n\nDivide the second equation by 1,000:\n\nB + 5T = 0.6P / 1,000\n\nWait, 0.6P is the number of people to be covered, so 0.6P should be a number, but here I'm treating it as a variable.\n\nLet\u2019s denote 0.6P as C for simplicity.\n\nSo, B + 5T = C\n\nNow, solve the system:\n\n3B + 20T = 5,000\n\nB + 5T = C\n\nLet\u2019s solve for B and T.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\nB = C - 5T\n\nPlug into the first equation:\n\n3(C - 5T) + 20T = 5,000\n\n3C - 15T + 20T = 5,000\n\n3C + 5T = 5,000\n\nThen, 5T = 5,000 - 3C\n\nT = (5,000 - 3C)/5\n\nSimilarly, B = C - 5T = C - 5*(5,000 - 3C)/5 = C - (5,000 - 3C) = C - 5,000 + 3C = 4C - 5,000\n\nSo, B = 4C - 5,000\n\nT = (5,000 - 3C)/5\n\nNow, since B and T must be non-negative integers, we have:\n\nB \u2265 0 \u2192 4C - 5,000 \u2265 0 \u2192 C \u2265 1,250\n\nT \u2265 0 \u2192 5,000 - 3C \u2265 0 \u2192 C \u2264 5,000 / 3 \u2248 1,666.67\n\nTherefore, C must be between 1,250 and 1,666.67.\n\nBut C is 0.6P, and P is the population.\n\nSo, 1,250 \u2264 0.6P \u2264 1,666.67\n\nTherefore, P must be between 1,250 / 0.6 \u2248 2,083.33 and 1,666.67 / 0.6 \u2248 2,777.78\n\nBut population can't be a fraction, so P must be between 2,084 and 2,777 people.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Earlier, I had P \u2264 2,777,778.\n\nI think I made a mistake in units.\n\nWait, in earlier calculations, I had:\n\n180P \u2264 500,000,000\n\nP \u2264 500,000,000 / 180 \u2248 2,777,778\n\nBut here, I have C = 0.6P, and C must be between 1,250 and 1,666.67, which would imply P is between 2,083.33 and 2,777.78, but that doesn't make sense because earlier P was up to almost 2.8 million.\n\nI think the issue is with the units. Maybe I need to ensure consistent units throughout.\n\nLet me redefine C as the number of people to be covered, which is 0.6P.\n\nBut in earlier steps, I used C in thousands or something similar. I need to be careful with units.\n\nLet me start again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- C = 0.6P (number of people to be covered)\n\n- Each bus covers 1,000 people\n\n- Each train covers 5,000 people\n\nThen, the coverage constraint is:\n\n1,000B + 5,000T \u2265 C\n\nThe budget constraint is:\n\n300,000B + 2,000,000T \u2264 500,000,000\n\nLet\u2019s divide the budget equation by 100,000:\n\n3B + 20T \u2264 5,000\n\nAnd the coverage equation by 1,000:\n\nB + 5T \u2265 C / 1,000\n\nLet\u2019s denote c = C / 1,000, which is 0.6P / 1,000\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\n3B + 20T \u2264 5,000\n\nB + 5T \u2265 c\n\nB, T \u2265 0\n\nNow, to minimize cost, which is 300,000B + 2,000,000T, but since 300,000B + 2,000,000T is proportional to 3B + 20T, we can minimize 3B + 20T subject to B + 5T \u2265 c and B, T \u2265 0.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by:\n\n3B + 20T \u2264 5,000\n\nB + 5T \u2265 c\n\nB, T \u2265 0\n\nThe optimal solution will be at one of the corners of this region.\n\nThe corners are:\n\n1. Intersection of 3B + 20T = 5,000 and B + 5T = c\n\n2. B = 0, T = floor(5,000 / 20) = 250\n\n3. T = 0, B = floor(5,000 / 3) \u2248 1,666\n\nBut since we have the coverage constraint B + 5T \u2265 c, we need to ensure that the solution satisfies this.\n\nLet\u2019s find the intersection point.\n\nSolve 3B + 20T = 5,000 and B + 5T = c.\n\nFrom B + 5T = c, we get B = c - 5T\n\nPlug into 3B + 20T = 5,000:\n\n3(c - 5T) + 20T = 5,000\n\n3c - 15T + 20T = 5,000\n\n3c + 5T = 5,000\n\nThen, 5T = 5,000 - 3c\n\nT = (5,000 - 3c)/5\n\nSimilarly, B = c - 5T = c - 5*(5,000 - 3c)/5 = c - (5,000 - 3c) = 4c - 5,000\n\nSo, B = 4c - 5,000\n\nT = (5,000 - 3c)/5\n\nNow, B and T must be non-negative.\n\nTherefore:\n\n4c - 5,000 \u2265 0 \u2192 c \u2265 1,250\n\nAnd\n\n5,000 - 3c \u2265 0 \u2192 c \u2264 5,000 / 3 \u2248 1,666.67\n\nSo, c must be between 1,250 and 1,666.67\n\nRecall that c = 0.6P / 1,000\n\nTherefore, 1,250 \u2264 0.6P / 1,000 \u2264 1,666.67\n\nMultiply all parts by 1,000:\n\n1,250,000 \u2264 0.6P \u2264 1,666,670\n\nThen, divide by 0.6:\n\n1,250,000 / 0.6 \u2248 2,083,333.33 \u2264 P \u2264 1,666,670 / 0.6 \u2248 2,777,783.33\n\nSo, for populations between approximately 2,083,333 and 2,777,783, the optimal solution is to buy B = 4c - 5,000 buses and T = (5,000 - 3c)/5 trains.\n\nFor P < 2,083,333, buy only buses to cover 0.6P people.\n\nFor P > 2,777,783, it's not possible to cover 60% of the population with the given budget.\n\nWait, but earlier I had P \u2264 2,777,778, which aligns with this.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- If P \u2264 2,083,333, buy enough buses to cover 0.6P people, which will cost less than $500 million.\n\n- If 2,083,333 < P \u2264 2,777,783, buy a combination of buses and trains as calculated above.\n\n- If P > 2,777,783, it's not possible to cover 60% of the population with the given budget.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the population, so perhaps I need to consider different cases based on P.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the city's population is such that it falls within one of these ranges, and I need to calculate accordingly.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I should assume a specific population within the feasible range and proceed with calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption that each bus covers 1,000 people and each train covers 5,000 people is not accurate, and I need to find a better way to estimate coverage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the walking distance and stop distribution more carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different approach.\n\nAssume that the city is laid out in a grid, and stops are placed such that their coverage areas are somewhat non-overlapping.\n\nGiven that people can walk up to 833 meters to a stop, the stops can be placed approximately 1.666 kilometers apart (since the coverage areas should overlap slightly).\n\nBut this is getting too complicated without specific data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of stops needed based on the city's area and population density.\n\nBut again, without specific data, this is speculative.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the earlier approach.\n\nAssuming that each bus stop covers 1,000 people and each train station covers 5,000 people, and that the city's population P is such that 0.6P falls within the range of 1,250 to 1,666.67 thousand people.\n\nThen, the optimal number of buses and trains can be calculated using the formulas:\n\nB = 4c - 5,000\n\nT = (5,000 - 3c)/5\n\nWhere c = 0.6P / 1,000\n\nFor example, if P = 2,500,000, then c = 0.6 * 2,500,000 / 1,000 = 1,500\n\nThen, B = 4*1,500 - 5,000 = 6,000 - 5,000 = 1,000 buses\n\nT = (5,000 - 3*1,500)/5 = (5,000 - 4,500)/5 = 500/5 = 100 trains\n\nThen, check the cost: 1,000 * 300,000 + 100 * 2,000,000 = 300,000,000 + 200,000,000 = 500,000,000, which matches the budget.\n\nAnd the coverage: 1,000 * 1,000 + 100 * 5,000 = 1,000,000 + 500,000 = 1,500,000 people, which is 0.6 * 2,500,000.\n\nTherefore, for P = 2,500,000, the optimal numbers are 1,000 buses and 100 trains.\n\nSimilarly, for other values of P within the range, the numbers can be calculated accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal number of buses and trains depends on the city's population. For populations between approximately 2,083,333 and 2,777,783, a combination of buses and trains can be calculated using the formulas derived above. For populations below 2,083,333, buying only buses is sufficient and optimal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The optimal number of buses and trains depends on the city's population and can be calculated using the derived formulas.}}"
