Each step should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be either the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nSearchEngine[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information from any search engine. This tool is useful in finding relevant sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebsiteScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQAtool[input]: A question answering tool that can provide answers based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAtool[What is the capital of France, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the 2018 FIFA World Cup and who was the top scorer?"
