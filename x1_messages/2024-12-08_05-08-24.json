        "content": "Ah, you're thinking about marine life! The large marine mammal you're referring to, often called the \"sea cow,\" is the manatee. Manatees are indeed primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants. They inhabit shallow coastal areas, estuaries, and rivers, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. These gentle giants are known for their slow-moving nature and are unfortunately classified as vulnerable or endangered due to various threats including habitat loss and boat collisions. It's fascinating how such peaceful creatures play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to maintain healthy seagrass beds through their grazing activities. If you have any more questions about manatees or other marine mammals, feel free to ask!"
