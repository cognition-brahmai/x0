        "content": "Let's see. If a person drinks 8 glasses of water each day, and each glass contains 250 milliliters, I need to find out how many liters they consume in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much water they drink in one day. Since each glass is 250 milliliters and they drink 8 glasses, I can multiply 250 by 8 to get the daily consumption in milliliters.\n\nSo, 250 milliliters/glass * 8 glasses/day = 2000 milliliters/day.\n\nNow, I need to convert milliliters to liters because the question asks for the answer in liters. I know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. Therefore, to convert milliliters to liters, I divide by 1000.\n\nSo, 2000 milliliters/day \u00f7 1000 = 2 liters/day.\n\nNext, to find out the weekly consumption, I need to multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, 2 liters/day * 7 days/week = 14 liters/week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 8 glasses/day, each glass is 250 milliliters.\n\n8 * 250 = 2000 milliliters/day.\n\n2000 milliliters \u00f7 1000 = 2 liters/day.\n\n2 liters/day * 7 days = 14 liters/week.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in total milliliters for the week and then convert to liters.\n\nSo, 8 glasses/day * 250 milliliters/glass * 7 days = 8 * 250 * 7 milliliters.\n\nFirst, 8 * 250 = 2000 milliliters/day.\n\nThen, 2000 * 7 = 14,000 milliliters/week.\n\nNow, convert to liters: 14,000 milliliters \u00f7 1000 = 14 liters/week.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the daily consumption to liters first and then multiply by 7.\n\n8 glasses/day * 250 milliliters/glass = 2000 milliliters/day = 2 liters/day.\n\nThen, 2 liters/day * 7 days = 14 liters/week.\n\nOr, think of it in terms of liters per glass.\n\nEach glass is 250 milliliters, which is 0.25 liters (since 250 \u00f7 1000 = 0.25).\n\nSo, 8 glasses/day * 0.25 liters/glass = 2 liters/day.\n\nThen, 2 liters/day * 7 days = 14 liters/week.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the person consumes 14 liters of water in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
