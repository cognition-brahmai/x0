Okay, first things first, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n1. (6 * 4) and (3 - 1)\n\nLet's calculate those:\n\n6 * 4 = 24\n\n3 - 1 = 2\n\nNow the expression looks like this: 24 / 2 - 5 * 2\n\nNext, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\n24 / 2 = 12\n\nThen, 12 - 5 * 2\n\nNow, 5 * 2 = 10\n\nSo, 12 - 10 = 2\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
