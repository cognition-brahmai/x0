        "content": "So, in this class, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 18 have brown eyes. That means the rest have blue eyes, right? So, to find out how many have blue eyes, I can subtract the number of brown-eyed students from the total number of students.\n\nSo, 30 minus 18 equals 12. So, there are 12 students with blue eyes.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the ratio of brown-eyed students to blue-eyed students. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, to find the ratio, I can put the number of brown-eyed students over the number of blue-eyed students.\n\nThat would be 18 to 12. Ratios can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 18 and 12 is 6.\n\nSo, dividing both 18 and 12 by 6 gives 3 and 2, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of brown-eyed students to blue-eyed students is 3:2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:2} \\]"
