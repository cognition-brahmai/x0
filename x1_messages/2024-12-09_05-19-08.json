        "content": "Let's see... there are 5 houses in a row, and I need to figure out which one is in the middle. Let me list them out to visualize better: House #1, House #2, House #3, House #4, House #5. Okay, now let's look at the clues one by one.\n\nFirst, it says \"House #1 is next to house #2.\" Well, that's straightforward. In a row, next to means adjacent, so House #1 and House #2 are neighbors.\n\nNext, \"House #2 is between house #1 and house #3.\" So, House #2 is in the middle of House #1 and House #3. That means the order so far is House #1, House #2, House #3.\n\nThen, \"House #3 is between house #2 and house #4.\" So, House #3 is in the middle of House #2 and House #4. Given the previous order, this makes sense. So now, the order is House #1, House #2, House #3, House #4.\n\nLastly, \"House #4 is next to house #5.\" So, House #4 and House #5 are adjacent. Since House #4 is already at the end of our current order, this means House #5 comes after House #4.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the order is House #1, House #2, House #3, House #4, House #5.\n\nNow, which one is in the middle? In a row of 5 houses, the middle house would be the third one. So, House #3 is in the middle.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. Let's see:\n\n- House #1 is next to House #2: yes, in this order, they are next to each other.\n\n- House #2 is between House #1 and House #3: yes, that's correct.\n\n- House #3 is between House #2 and House #4: yes, that's correct.\n\n- House #4 is next to House #5: yes, they are next to each other.\n\nEverything seems to fit. So, the house in the middle is House #3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
