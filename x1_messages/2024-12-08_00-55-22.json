        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train going from Town A to Town B at a constant speed, but halfway through, it stops for 15 minutes due to a technical issue. Then, it continues the rest of the journey at half its original speed. Because of these delays, the total travel time is 3 hours longer than what was initially planned. We need to find out what that initial planned travel time was.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the total distance between Town A and Town B is D kilometers. The train's original speed is S kilometers per hour.\n\nSo, the initial planned travel time, which we'll call T, would be the total distance divided by the speed: T = D / S.\n\nNow, let's see what actually happened.\n\nThe train travels halfway, so it covers D/2 kilometers at the original speed S. The time taken for this part is (D/2) / S = D/(2S).\n\nThen, it stops for 15 minutes. Since time is usually in hours in these problems, let's convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.\n\nAfter the stop, it continues the remaining half of the journey, D/2 kilometers, but at half the original speed, which is S/2 kilometers per hour. So, the time taken for the second half is (D/2) / (S/2) = (D/2) * (2/S) = D/S.\n\nNow, the total actual travel time is the sum of these parts: time for the first half + stop time + time for the second half. That is:\n\nTotal actual time = D/(2S) + 0.25 + D/S\n\nWe know that this actual time is 3 hours longer than the initial planned time T. So:\n\nD/(2S) + 0.25 + D/S = T + 3\n\nBut remember that T = D / S. So, let's substitute T in the equation:\n\nD/(2S) + 0.25 + D/S = D/S + 3\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation. First, subtract D/S from both sides:\n\nD/(2S) + 0.25 + D/S - D/S = D/S + 3 - D/S\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nD/(2S) + 0.25 = 3\n\nNow, subtract 0.25 from both sides:\n\nD/(2S) = 2.75\n\nBut 2.75 is the same as 11/4 (since 2.75 = 11/4). So:\n\nD/(2S) = 11/4\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 2S:\n\nD = (11/4) * 2S\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nD = (11/4) * 2S = (11/2) S\n\nNow, recall that the initial planned time T = D / S. Substitute D from above:\n\nT = (11/2) S / S\n\nThe S cancels out:\n\nT = 11/2 hours\n\nWhich is 5.5 hours.\n\nSo, the initial planned travel time was 5.5 hours.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf T = 5.5 hours, and the actual time is 3 hours longer, that's 8.5 hours.\n\nLet's see if the parts add up.\n\nFirst half: D/2 at speed S, time = D/(2S) = (11/4) hours (since D = 11/2 S, D/(2S) = (11/2 S)/(2S) = 11/4 hours = 2.75 hours)\n\nStop: 0.25 hours\n\nSecond half: D/2 at speed S/2, time = D/S = 11/2 hours = 5.5 hours\n\nTotal actual time: 2.75 + 0.25 + 5.5 = 8.5 hours, which is indeed 3 hours more than the planned 5.5 hours.\n\nSo, the answer seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
