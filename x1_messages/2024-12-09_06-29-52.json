        "content": "So I have this equation to solve: log(x) + log(10) = 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on logarithms, but let's see what I can do.\n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms have some properties that can help me simplify the equation. Specifically, there's one property that says log(a) + log(b) equals log(a*b). So maybe I can combine the two logarithms on the left side.\n\nLet me try that: log(x) + log(10) = log(x*10). So the equation becomes log(x*10) = 2.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x in this equation. I recall that if I have log_b(y) = z, then y = b^z. But I need to know the base of the logarithm here. In math problems, if the base isn't specified, it's usually 10. So I'll assume that log here means log base 10.\n\nSo, log base 10 of (x*10) equals 2. That means x*10 = 10^2.\n\n10^2 is 100, right? So x*10 = 100.\n\nNow, to find x, I just need to divide both sides by 10: x = 100 / 10 = 10.\n\nWait a minute, but if I plug x = 10 back into the original equation, let's check if it makes sense.\n\nlog(10) + log(10) = log(10) + log(10) = 1 + 1 = 2. Yes, that checks out.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm.\n\nAnother property of logarithms is that log(a) + log(b) = log(a*b), which I already used. Alternatively, I could have subtracted log(10) from both sides: log(x) = 2 - log(10).\n\nSince log(10) is 1, then log(x) = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nSo log(x) = 1, which again means x = 10^1 = 10.\n\nSame answer as before. Good, that matches.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using natural logarithms or something, but I don't think that's necessary here since the problem is in base 10.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that x = 10 is indeed a valid solution by plugging it back into the original equation, which I already did, and it checks out.\n\nSo, the solution is x = 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
