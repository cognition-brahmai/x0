        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got an office building with 15 floors. Each floor has 4 offices, and each office has 6 rooms. We need to find out how many rooms there are in the entire building.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how the rooms are organized. It seems like there's a hierarchy here: floors contain offices, and offices contain rooms. So, to find the total number of rooms, I need to multiply the number of floors by the number of offices per floor, and then multiply that by the number of rooms per office.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal rooms = number of floors \u00d7 number of offices per floor \u00d7 number of rooms per office\n\nNow, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal rooms = 15 floors \u00d7 4 offices/floor \u00d7 6 rooms/office\n\nI can multiply these step by step. First, 15 floors times 4 offices per floor:\n\n15 \u00d7 4 = 60 offices\n\nThen, those 60 offices times 6 rooms per office:\n\n60 \u00d7 6 = 360 rooms\n\nSo, there are 360 rooms in the entire building.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way could be to find out how many rooms are on one floor and then multiply by the number of floors.\n\nSo, rooms per floor = number of offices per floor \u00d7 number of rooms per office\n\nRooms per floor = 4 offices/floor \u00d7 6 rooms/office = 24 rooms/floor\n\nThen, total rooms = number of floors \u00d7 rooms per floor = 15 floors \u00d7 24 rooms/floor\n\nNow, 15 \u00d7 24:\n\n15 \u00d7 20 = 300\n\n15 \u00d7 4 = 60\n\nAdding them up: 300 + 60 = 360 rooms\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. Good, it seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe considering the total number of offices in the building first.\n\nTotal offices = number of floors \u00d7 number of offices per floor = 15 \u00d7 4 = 60 offices\n\nThen, total rooms = total offices \u00d7 number of rooms per office = 60 \u00d7 6 = 360 rooms\n\nAgain, the same answer. This gives me confidence that 360 is the correct total number of rooms in the building.\n\nLet me just make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. The problem doesn't mention any additional rooms like lounges, restrooms, or other non-office spaces, so I'm assuming that all rooms are contained within the offices.\n\nAlso, there's no information suggesting that the number of offices or rooms varies between floors, so I can proceed with the multiplication as is.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 360 rooms in the entire building.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
