But in the magical world of Harry Potter, it takes on a whole new meaning.\n\nThe book you're referring to is \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\" It's the first book in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. In this story, the Philosopher's Stone isn't about turning metals into gold; instead, it's a powerful magical object that can create the Elixir of Life, which grants the drinker immortality.\n\nIn the book, there's a plot to steal this stone, and Harry, along with his friends Ron and Hermione, have to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, specifically those of the villain who was behind his parents' death.\n\nIt's interesting how J.K. Rowling took a concept from real-world mythology and alchemy and gave it a magical twist in her books. The stone becomes a central element in the plot, driving the adventures and challenges that Harry faces in his first year at Hogwarts.\n\nSo, to sum it up, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" is the book you're thinking of, where the Philosopher's Stone is a powerful magical artifact with the ability to grant eternal life."
