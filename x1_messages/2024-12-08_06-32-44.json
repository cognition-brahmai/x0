        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with different colored balls: 5 red, 8 blue, and 12 green. And the question is, if you pick one ball at random, what's the probability that it's either red or blue?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula for probability. Probability of an event is usually the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the bag.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of balls first. There are 5 red, 8 blue, and 12 green. So, total balls = 5 + 8 + 12 = 25 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, which is 5 + 8 = 13.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red or blue ball should be 13/25.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Is there any other way to approach this? Maybe I can think about the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green balls is 12, so the probability of picking a green ball is 12/25. Therefore, the probability of not picking a green ball (which would be picking either red or blue) is 1 - 12/25 = 13/25.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it looks like 13/25 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. Are the balls different sizes or anything like that? The problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I'm assuming all balls are identical except for their colors.\n\nAlso, since we're picking only one ball, the order doesn't matter, and there's no replacement because it's just a single pick.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 13/25 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{25}} \\]"
