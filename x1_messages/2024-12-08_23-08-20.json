        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 apples and 3 oranges in a basket, so total fruits are 5 + 3 = 8. I need to find the probability that both fruits picked are apples, and I pick them one after another without replacement, meaning I don't put the first fruit back before picking the second.\n\nSo, probability of picking two apples in a row without replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of picking an apple on the first pick. That should be the number of apples divided by the total number of fruits, which is 5/8.\n\nThen, since I'm not putting it back, the total number of fruits decreases by one, so now there are 7 fruits left. And since I picked an apple first, there are now 4 apples left.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another apple is 4/7.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I need to multiply the probabilities together.\n\nSo, (5/8) * (4/7) should give me the answer.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n5 times 4 is 20, and 8 times 7 is 56, so 20/56.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives 5/14.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/14.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of ways to pick 2 apples out of 5, divided by the number of ways to pick any 2 fruits out of 8.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 apples from 5 is combination of 5 choose 2, which is (5*4)/2 = 10.\n\nThe number of ways to pick any 2 fruits from 8 is combination of 8 choose 2, which is (8*7)/2 = 28.\n\nSo, the probability is 10/28, which simplifies to 5/14.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/14.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nI can think about the probabilities step by step.\n\nProbability first pick is an apple: 5/8.\n\nGiven that the first pick was an apple, now there are 4 apples left and 7 fruits in total.\n\nSo, probability second pick is an apple given the first was an apple is 4/7.\n\nMultiply them: (5/8)*(4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the scenario where the first pick is an orange, but since we're only interested in both being apples, that path isn't relevant here.\n\nSo, yes, I think 5/14 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{14}} \\]"
