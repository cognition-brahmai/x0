        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells two types of items: type X and type Y. The profit margin for each type X item is $12, and for each type Y item, it's $8. Last month, the store sold a total of 100 items and made a total profit of $980. We need to find out how many of each type were sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of type X items sold as \\( x \\) and the number of type Y items sold as \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items sold is 100.\n\n2. The total profit from these sales is $980.\n\nSo, we can translate these into mathematical equations.\n\nThe first equation would represent the total number of items sold:\n\n\\( x + y = 100 \\)\n\nThe second equation would represent the total profit:\n\n\\( 12x + 8y = 980 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. To solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I think I'll use the substitution method for this problem.\n\nFirst, I'll solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( y = 100 - x \\)\n\nNow, I'll substitute this expression for \\( y \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 12x + 8(100 - x) = 980 \\)\n\nOkay, now let's simplify and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( 12x + 800 - 8x = 980 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 4x + 800 = 980 \\)\n\nSubtract 800 from both sides:\n\n\\( 4x = 180 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\( x = 45 \\)\n\nSo, 45 items of type X were sold.\n\nNow, let's find \\( y \\) using the expression we had earlier:\n\n\\( y = 100 - x = 100 - 45 = 55 \\)\n\nTherefore, 55 items of type Y were sold.\n\nTo make sure our answer is correct, let's check it against the original conditions.\n\nFirst, total items: \\( 45 + 55 = 100 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond, total profit: \\( 12 \\times 45 + 8 \\times 55 = 540 + 440 = 980 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, the store sold 45 items of type X and 55 items of type Y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ items of type X and } 55 \\text{ items of type Y}} \\]"
