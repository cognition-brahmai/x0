You start with 30 cookies and eat 10 pretzels, but since they are different types of items, you can't directly subtract pretzels from cookies to find out how many cookies are left. If you meant to start with 30 cookies and eat 10 cookies, then you would have 20 cookies left. Please clarify if you meant something else."
