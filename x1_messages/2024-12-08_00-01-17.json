        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're given that the ratio of cars to motorcycles is 4:7, and the total number of vehicles is 27,000. We need to find out how many cars and how many motorcycles there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 4:7 means that for every 4 cars, there are 7 motorcycles. So, the total parts of the ratio are 4 + 7 = 11 parts.\n\nNow, these 11 parts represent the total number of vehicles, which is 27,000. So, each part must represent 27,000 divided by 11. Let me calculate that:\n\n27,000 \u00f7 11 = 2,454.5454...\n\nHmm, that's a repeating decimal. Maybe I should leave it as a fraction to avoid decimals. So, each part is 27,000/11 vehicles.\n\nNow, since cars are 4 parts of the total, the number of cars would be 4 times 27,000 divided by 11. Similarly, motorcycles are 7 parts, so it would be 7 times 27,000 divided by 11.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of cars = (4/11) * 27,000\n\nNumber of motorcycles = (7/11) * 27,000\n\nNow, let's calculate these.\n\nFirst, (4/11) * 27,000.\n\n4 times 27,000 is 108,000.\n\nThen, 108,000 divided by 11 is 9,818.1818...\n\nSimilarly, (7/11) * 27,000.\n\n7 times 27,000 is 189,000.\n\n189,000 divided by 11 is 17,181.8181...\n\nBut vehicles can't be in decimals; they have to be whole numbers. Maybe there's a rounding error here. Perhaps the total number of vehicles isn't exactly divisible by 11, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait a minute, 4 + 7 is 11, and 27,000 divided by 11 is approximately 2,454.5454, which is not a whole number. That's strange because the number of vehicles should be a whole number.\n\nMaybe the problem assumes that the ratio is approximate, and the total is exactly 27,000. Alternatively, perhaps the total number of vehicles is meant to be divisible by 11.\n\nLet me check the division again: 27,000 \u00f7 11 = 2,454.5454...\n\nIndeed, it's not a whole number. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the ratio is exact, and the total number of vehicles is exact, meaning that the number of cars and motorcycles must be integers, and the ratio is exactly 4:7.\n\nIn that case, let's denote the number of cars as 4k and the number of motorcycles as 7k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nThen, the total number of vehicles is 4k + 7k = 11k.\n\nWe're told that the total number of vehicles is 27,000, so:\n\n11k = 27,000\n\nTherefore, k = 27,000 \u00f7 11 \u2248 2,454.5454...\n\nBut k must be an integer because the number of vehicles can't be fractional. This suggests that either the ratio isn't exact, or the total number of vehicles isn't exactly 27,000, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of vehicles is meant to be divisible by 11. Let me check what 11 times 2,454 is:\n\n11 * 2,454 = 26,994\n\nThat's 6 less than 27,000.\n\nAlternatively, 11 * 2,455 = 27,005, which is 5 more than 27,000.\n\nSo, neither multiple of 11 gives exactly 27,000. This discrepancy suggests that either the ratio isn't exact, or there's a rounding involved.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to round the numbers to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, if k = 2,454.5454..., then:\n\nNumber of cars = 4 * 2,454.5454... \u2248 9,818.1818...\n\nNumber of motorcycles = 7 * 2,454.5454... \u2248 17,181.8181...\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number:\n\nCars: 9,818\n\nMotorcycles: 17,182\n\nLet's check if these add up to 27,000:\n\n9,818 + 17,182 = 27,000\n\nYes, they do.\n\nAlternatively, if we round down for cars and round up for motorcycles, or vice versa, as long as the total is 27,000.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is not meant to be taken so strictly, and we can solve it using algebra.\n\nLet\u2019s let the number of cars be 4x and the number of motorcycles be 7x, where x is a real number.\n\nThen, 4x + 7x = 27,000\n\n11x = 27,000\n\nx = 27,000 / 11 \u2248 2,454.5454...\n\nThen, cars = 4 * 2,454.5454... \u2248 9,818.1818...\n\nMotorcycles = 7 * 2,454.5454... \u2248 17,181.8181...\n\nAgain, we end up with the same numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is meant to be approximate, and we're expected to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, if we take cars as 9,818 and motorcycles as 17,182, the total is 27,000.\n\nLet\u2019s check the ratio:\n\n9,818 : 17,182\n\nDividing both by 9818:\n\n1 : 1.75\n\nWait, 17,182 \u00f7 9,818 \u2248 1.75\n\nSo, that's approximately 4:7.\n\nAlternatively, 4:7 is approximately 0.5714, and 9,818 / 17,182 \u2248 0.5714.\n\nSo, it matches the ratio.\n\nTherefore, the number of cars is 9,818 and the number of motorcycles is 17,182.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to avoid the decimal by choosing a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the ratio is 4:7, meaning that for every 4 cars, there are 7 motorcycles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of sets of 4 cars and 7 motorcycles as n.\n\nThen, total vehicles = 4n + 7n = 11n = 27,000\n\nSo, n = 27,000 / 11 \u2248 2,454.5454...\n\nAgain, we end up with the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the number of cars and motorcycles must be integers, and find the closest possible values that maintain the ratio and the total.\n\nSo, with n = 2,454, total vehicles = 11 * 2,454 = 26,994\n\nThat's 6 less than 27,000.\n\nAlternatively, with n = 2,455, total vehicles = 11 * 2,455 = 27,005\n\nThat's 5 more than 27,000.\n\nSo, neither option gives exactly 27,000 vehicles.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows for a slight discrepancy in the ratio to achieve the exact total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to interpret the ratio as approximate and proceed with the rounding as before.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be approximately 9,818 cars and 17,182 motorcycles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and the total number of vehicles should be divisible by 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is not 4:7, but something else that divides 27,000 exactly.\n\nBut based on the information given, I think the best approach is to proceed with the ratio as exact and accept that the number of vehicles per part isn't a whole number, leading to fractional vehicles, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is meant to be taken as approximate, and we're expected to find whole numbers that are as close as possible to maintaining that ratio.\n\nIn that case, 9,818 cars and 17,182 motorcycles seem to fit the bill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s try to set it up as an equation.\n\nLet c be the number of cars and m be the number of motorcycles.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) c / m = 4 / 7\n\n2) c + m = 27,000\n\nFrom equation 1), c = (4/7) m\n\nSubstituting into equation 2):\n\n(4/7) m + m = 27,000\n\n(4/7 m + 7/7 m) = 27,000\n\n(11/7) m = 27,000\n\nm = 27,000 * 7 / 11 = 189,000 / 11 \u2248 17,181.8181...\n\nThen, c = (4/7) * 17,181.8181... \u2248 9,818.1818...\n\nAgain, we end up with the same numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the ratio is not exact, and we need to find integers c and m such that c/m \u2248 4/7 and c + m = 27,000.\n\nIn that case, we can use the method of proportions to find the closest integers.\n\nSo, c \u2248 (4/11) * 27,000 \u2248 9,818.1818... \u2192 9,818\n\nm \u2248 (7/11) * 27,000 \u2248 17,181.8181... \u2192 17,182\n\nAnd indeed, 9,818 + 17,182 = 27,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to distribute the remainder.\n\nSince 11 * 2,454 = 26,994, which is 6 less than 27,000, we can add 6 to one of the categories.\n\nBut according to the ratio, cars are 4 parts and motorcycles are 7 parts.\n\nSo, perhaps we can proportionally distribute the remainder.\n\nBut that might complicate things further.\n\nGiven that, I think the simplest and most straightforward approach is to accept the rounded values: 9,818 cars and 17,182 motorcycles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to express the answer in terms of the ratio without rounding.\n\nBut since the number of vehicles must be whole numbers, I think rounding is acceptable here.\n\nTherefore, the city has approximately 9,818 cars and 17,182 motorcycles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9818 \\text{ cars and } 17182 \\text{ motorcycles}} \\]"
