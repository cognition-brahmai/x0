        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if it takes 6 workers 8 hours to complete a job, how long would it take for 12 workers to complete the same job? Hmm, this seems like a straightforward problem involving inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a job. Basically, if you have more workers, the job should get done faster, right?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken. Since more workers should mean less time to complete the job, it's an inverse proportion. That means that the product of the number of workers and the time taken should be constant. So, workers times hours equals a constant value. Mathematically, that's:\n\nworkers \u00d7 hours = k\n\nWhere k is the constant.\n\nGiven that 6 workers take 8 hours, I can find k:\n\nk = 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nNow, if the number of workers doubles to 12, I need to find the new time taken, let's call it t. So:\n\n12 \u00d7 t = 48\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = 48 / 12 = 4 hours\n\nSo, it should take 12 workers 4 hours to complete the same job.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it. Perhaps I can think in terms of total man-hours required to complete the job. If 6 workers take 8 hours, then the total man-hours needed are:\n\n6 workers \u00d7 8 hours = 48 man-hours\n\nNo matter how many workers you have, the total man-hours required remain the same. So, if you have 12 workers, the time taken would be:\n\ntotal man-hours / number of workers = 48 / 12 = 4 hours\n\nThat matches my previous calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors to consider. Is there any possibility that adding more workers wouldn't halve the time? For example, maybe there are limitations in the workspace that prevent too many workers from being effective simultaneously. But since the problem doesn't mention any such constraints, I'll assume that the relationship is purely inversely proportional.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the work rate of the workers. If 6 workers take 8 hours, then the combined work rate is 1 job per 8 hours. So, the work rate per worker would be:\n\n1 job / (6 workers \u00d7 8 hours) = 1/48 jobs per worker-hour\n\nNow, if you have 12 workers, their combined work rate would be:\n\n12 workers \u00d7 1/48 jobs per hour = 12/48 = 1/4 jobs per hour\n\nSo, to complete 1 job, the time taken would be:\n\ntime = job / rate = 1 / (1/4) = 4 hours\n\nAgain, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nLet me try another approach. If 6 workers take 8 hours, then increasing the number of workers by a factor of 2 (to 12 workers) should halve the time, assuming everything else is equal. So, 8 hours divided by 2 is 4 hours. That's a quick way to think about it and it matches the previous calculations.\n\nIs there any chance that this relationship doesn't hold? For example, in some scenarios, adding more workers can lead to diminishing returns due to coordination issues or limited resources. But again, since the problem doesn't specify any such constraints, I'll stick with the assumption of perfect inverse proportionality.\n\nSo, concluding, it should take 12 workers 4 hours to complete the job.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
