        "content": "So here's the situation: Aunt Mary brought an apple pie, Uncle Joe brought a chocolate cake, and Cousin Lisa brought a plate of cookies. They initially placed their desserts on separate tables: Table 1 for the apple pie, Table 2 for the chocolate cake, and Table 3 for the cookies. Then, while everyone was outside playing games, Grandma decided to mix things up by switching the desserts around. Now, Table 1 has the cookies, Table 2 has the apple pie, and Table 3 has the chocolate cake.\n\nThe question is, when it's time for dessert, where will each person go to find their respective treats?\n\nLet's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to know which dessert each person brought and where it is now after Grandma's switch.\n\n- Aunt Mary brought the apple pie. Originally on Table 1, but now it's on Table 2.\n\n- Uncle Joe brought the chocolate cake. Originally on Table 2, but now it's on Table 3.\n\n- Cousin Lisa brought the cookies. Originally on Table 3, but now it's on Table 1.\n\nSo, when they go to get their desserts, they might remember where they originally placed them, but since Grandma moved them, they might get confused.\n\nAssuming they don't know about the switch and go to where they originally put their desserts, here's what would happen:\n\n- Aunt Mary goes to Table 1, but finds cookies there instead of her apple pie.\n\n- Uncle Joe goes to Table 2, but finds the apple pie instead of his chocolate cake.\n\n- Cousin Lisa goes to Table 3, but finds the chocolate cake instead of her cookies.\n\nAlternatively, if they know about the switch and know Grandma's new arrangement, they would go to the new locations:\n\n- Aunt Mary would go to Table 2 to find her apple pie.\n\n- Uncle Joe would go to Table 3 to find his chocolate cake.\n\n- Cousin Lisa would go to Table 1 to find her cookies.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify whether they know about the switch or not. It just says Grandma switched them around while everyone was outside playing games.\n\nSo, I think the assumption is that they don't know about the switch and will go to the original tables where they placed their desserts.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Aunt Mary will go to Table 1, but find cookies.\n\n- Uncle Joe will go to Table 2, but find the apple pie.\n\n- Cousin Lisa will go to Table 3, but find the chocolate cake.\n\nBut, since they are looking for their own desserts, they might realize that something is amiss.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they notice the switch and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut based on the information given, I think the answer is that they will go to their original tables:\n\n- Aunt Mary to Table 1.\n\n- Uncle Joe to Table 2.\n\n- Cousin Lisa to Table 3.\n\nBut, as we've established, they won't find their own desserts there.\n\nWait, but the question is \"where will Aunt Mary, Uncle Joe, and Cousin Lisa go to find their respective treats?\"\n\nSo, perhaps it's asking where they need to go to find their own desserts, knowing the new arrangement.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Aunt Mary should go to Table 2 for the apple pie.\n\n- Uncle Joe should go to Table 3 for the chocolate cake.\n\n- Cousin Lisa should go to Table 1 for the cookies.\n\nBut again, it depends on whether they know about the switch.\n\nGiven the phrasing, I think the answer should be based on where their desserts are now, regardless of where they originally placed them.\n\nSo, to find their respective treats:\n\n- Aunt Mary's apple pie is on Table 2.\n\n- Uncle Joe's chocolate cake is on Table 3.\n\n- Cousin Lisa's cookies are on Table 1.\n\nTherefore, they should go to those tables to find their desserts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Aunt Mary: Table 2, Uncle Joe: Table 3, Cousin Lisa: Table 1}} \\]"
