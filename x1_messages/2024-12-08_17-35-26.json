        "content": "So the company has 80 employees and a bonus pool of $40,000 to distribute equally among them. To find out how much each employee gets, we need to divide the total bonus pool by the number of employees.\n\nSo, that's $40,000 divided by 80 employees.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n40,000 \u00f7 80 = ?\n\nFirst, I can simplify this division. I know that 80 times 500 is 40,000.\n\nBecause 80 \u00d7 500 = 40,000.\n\nSo, each employee would receive $500.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to move the decimal point. Since 40,000 is the same as 40.000 with the decimal points extended.\n\nBut actually, for division, it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down:\n\n40,000 divided by 80.\n\nWell, 80 times 500 is indeed 40,000.\n\nSo, yes, each employee would get $500.\n\nIs there any other way to verify this?\n\nPerhaps I can consider the total number of employees and the total bonus pool.\n\nIf each employee gets $500, then 80 employees times $500 each would equal $40,000.\n\nBecause 80 \u00d7 500 = 40,000.\n\nThat checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a calculator, which I can't right now, but I'm confident in my mental math here.\n\nSo, the answer is each employee receives $500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
