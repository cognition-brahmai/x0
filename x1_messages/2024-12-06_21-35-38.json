        "content": "So the factory makes 250 widgets each day, and we want to know how many it makes in a whole year, with 365 days. Okay, to find that out, I think I just need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a year.\n\nSo, that would be 250 widgets per day times 365 days. Let me do the math here. 250 times 365.\n\nFirst, maybe I can break it down to make it easier. I know that 250 times 100 is 25,000. Then 250 times 200 is 50,000. Wait, no, 250 times 200 should be 50,000, but let me check.\n\nActually, 250 times 100 is 25,000, so 250 times 200 would be double that, which is 50,000. Then 250 times 65, since 365 is 300 plus 65.\n\nWait, no, 365 is 300 plus 65, that makes sense. So, 250 times 300 is 75,000, and 250 times 65 is another amount.\n\nLet me calculate 250 times 65. 250 times 60 is 15,000, and 250 times 5 is 1,250. So, 15,000 plus 1,250 is 16,250.\n\nNow, adding that to the 75,000 from earlier: 75,000 plus 16,250 is 91,250.\n\nSo, the factory produces 91,250 widgets in a year.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 365 as 365, and multiply it directly by 250.\n\nSo, 365 times 250.\n\nI know that 365 times 100 is 36,500, and 365 times 200 is 73,000, and 365 times 50 is 18,250.\n\nWait, no, 365 times 200 is 73,000, and 365 times 50 is not 18,250. Let's see, 365 times 50 would be half of 365 times 100, which is 36,500 divided by 2, which is 18,250. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 73,000 plus 18,250 is 91,250. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that 250 is a quarter of 1,000, so 365 times 250 is the same as 365 times 1,000 divided by 4.\n\n365 times 1,000 is 365,000, and divided by 4 is 91,250. Again, the same result.\n\nSo, yes, the factory produces 91,250 widgets in a year.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any leap years or anything like that. The question says to assume it operates 365 days a year, so I don't need to worry about leap years.\n\nAlso, it doesn't mention any downtime for the factory, so I'll assume it runs every single day without fail.\n\nSo, final answer: 91,250 widgets per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{91250} \\]"
