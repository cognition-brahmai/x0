Maybe it's something like umbrellas. When it rains, people open their umbrellas, which go up. That makes sense. Or perhaps it's rainclouds, but they're already up in the sky. Wait, no. The rain is coming down from the clouds. So, maybe it's the water evaporating and forming clouds again. But that seems more like a cycle rather than going up when the rain comes down. Another possibility is steam or mist rising from the ground when it rains, especially if it's on a hot day. Yeah, that could be it. The heat from the ground combines with the cool rain, creating steam or mist that goes up. So, maybe steam or mist is the answer. But I think the most common answer would be umbrellas. What do you think?"
