        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a rectangle with a length of 20 cm and a width of 15 cm. So, the original area is length times width, right? That would be 20 cm * 15 cm = 300 cm\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to increase both the length and the width by the same percentage, and I want the new area to be exactly double the original area. Double of 300 cm\u00b2 is 600 cm\u00b2.\n\nLet's denote the percentage increase by 'p'. So, both the length and the width will be increased by 'p' percent.\n\nFirst, I need to express the new length and new width in terms of 'p'.\n\nThe new length will be the original length plus 'p' percent of the original length. That is:\n\nNew length = 20 cm + (p/100)*20 cm = 20 cm * (1 + p/100)\n\nSimilarly, the new width will be:\n\nNew width = 15 cm + (p/100)*15 cm = 15 cm * (1 + p/100)\n\nThe new area will be the product of the new length and new width:\n\nNew area = (20 cm * (1 + p/100)) * (15 cm * (1 + p/100)) = 20 * 15 * (1 + p/100)^2 = 300 cm\u00b2 * (1 + p/100)^2\n\nI want this new area to be 600 cm\u00b2, which is double the original area. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n300 * (1 + p/100)^2 = 600\n\nNow, I need to solve for 'p'.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 300:\n\n(1 + p/100)^2 = 2\n\nNext, take the square root of both sides:\n\n1 + p/100 = sqrt(2)\n\nNote that I'll consider only the positive square root because a negative percentage increase doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + p/100 = sqrt(2)\n\nNow, subtract 1 from both sides:\n\np/100 = sqrt(2) - 1\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 100 to solve for 'p':\n\np = 100 * (sqrt(2) - 1)\n\nNow, I can calculate the numerical value of p.\n\nFirst, find sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.4142.\n\nSo,\n\np = 100 * (1.4142 - 1) = 100 * 0.4142 = 41.42%\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase should be approximately 41.42% for both the length and the width to double the area of the rectangle.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this reasoning to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the original area: 20 cm * 15 cm = 300 cm\u00b2.\n\nNew area: 600 cm\u00b2.\n\nBoth dimensions increased by the same percentage, 'p'.\n\nNew length: 20 * (1 + p/100)\n\nNew width: 15 * (1 + p/100)\n\nNew area: 20*15*(1 + p/100)^2 = 300*(1 + p/100)^2 = 600\n\nSo, (1 + p/100)^2 = 2\n\nTaking square root: 1 + p/100 = sqrt(2)\n\nThen, p/100 = sqrt(2) - 1\n\nThus, p = 100*(sqrt(2) - 1)\n\nCalculating p: sqrt(2) \u2248 1.4142\n\nSo, p \u2248 100*(1.4142 - 1) = 100*0.4142 = 41.42%\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can verify by plugging this percentage back into the original dimensions and calculating the new area.\n\nOriginal length: 20 cm\n\nIncrease by 41.42%: 20 cm * 1.4142 \u2248 28.284 cm\n\nOriginal width: 15 cm\n\nIncrease by 41.42%: 15 cm * 1.4142 \u2248 21.213 cm\n\nNew area: 28.284 cm * 21.213 cm \u2248 600 cm\u00b2\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the percentage increase required is approximately 41.42%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41.42\\%} \\]\n"
