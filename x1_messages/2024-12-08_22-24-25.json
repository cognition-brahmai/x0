        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, 60% of the people own a car, and out of those car owners, 40% also own a bicycle. The total population is 600 people. I need to find out how many people own both a car and a bicycle.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many people own a car. Since 60% of the people own a car, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 600.\n\nSo, number of car owners = 60% of 600 = 0.60 * 600 = 360 people.\n\nNow, out of these 360 car owners, 40% also own a bicycle. So, to find out how many people own both, I need to calculate 40% of 360.\n\nNumber of people who own both = 40% of 360 = 0.40 * 360 = 144 people.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 60% of 600 is indeed 360. That's straightforward.\n\nThen, 40% of 360 should be 144. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of people who own both a car and a bicycle is 144.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages.\n\nTotal population = 600.\n\nPercentage owning a car = 60%.\n\nPercentage of car owners who also own a bicycle = 40%.\n\nSo, the percentage of the total population that owns both would be 60% * 40% = 24%.\n\nThen, 24% of 600 = 0.24 * 600 = 144.\n\nWait, that's the same answer I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use fractions.\n\n60% is 3/5, and 40% is 2/5.\n\nSo, 3/5 of the population owns a car, and 2/5 of those own a bicycle.\n\nTherefore, the fraction that owns both is 3/5 * 2/5 = 6/25.\n\nThen, 6/25 of 600 = (6/25)*600 = (6*600)/25 = 3600/25 = 144.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 144 is the correct number of people who own both a car and a bicycle.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for.\n\nIs there any possibility of people owning only a bicycle and not a car? The question doesn't provide that information, so I don't think I need to consider that.\n\nIt specifically asks for the number of people who own both a car and a bicycle, and I've calculated it to be 144 based on the given percentages.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]"
