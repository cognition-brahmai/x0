        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. It has a radius of 3 meters and a height of 4 meters, and I need to figure out how many liters of water it can hold when it's completely full. Also, there's a conversion factor given: 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder. I think the volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.1416\n\n- r is the radius of the base\n\n- h is the height of the cylinder\n\nGiven that the radius r is 3 meters and the height h is 4 meters, I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nSo,\n\nV = \u03c0 * (3 m)\u00b2 * 4 m\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, square the radius:\n\n(3 m)\u00b2 = 9 m\u00b2\n\nThen multiply by \u03c0:\n\n9 m\u00b2 * \u03c0 \u2248 9 m\u00b2 * 3.1416 \u2248 28.2744 m\u00b3\n\nFinally, multiply by the height:\n\n28.2744 m\u00b3 * 4 m = 113.0976 m\u00b3\n\nWait a minute, but volume should be in cubic meters, which it is. Now, I need to convert this volume from cubic meters to liters, using the given conversion factor: 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters.\n\nSo,\n\n113.0976 m\u00b3 * 1000 liters/m\u00b3 = 113,097.6 liters\n\nTherefore, the tank can hold approximately 113,097.6 liters of water when filled to capacity.\n\nBut, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nVolume of cylinder: V = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n\nr = 3 m\n\nh = 4 m\n\nV = 3.1416 * (3 m)\u00b2 * 4 m\n\nFirst, (3 m)\u00b2 = 9 m\u00b2\n\nThen, 3.1416 * 9 m\u00b2 = 28.2744 m\u00b2\n\nThen, 28.2744 m\u00b2 * 4 m = 113.0976 m\u00b3\n\nNow, convert to liters:\n\n113.0976 m\u00b3 * 1000 liters/m\u00b3 = 113,097.6 liters\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a more precise value of \u03c0, say 3.1415926535, to see if it makes a significant difference.\n\nV = 3.1415926535 * 9 m\u00b2 * 4 m = 113.097335526 m\u00b3\n\nThen, 113.097335526 m\u00b3 * 1000 liters/m\u00b3 = 113,097.335526 liters\n\nWhich is approximately the same as my earlier calculation: 113,097.6 liters.\n\nSo, I can be confident that the answer is around 113,097.6 liters.\n\nBut, perhaps I should consider the significant figures in the given data. The radius is given as 3 meters, and the height as 4 meters, both of which are whole numbers without decimal places, suggesting that they may have been measured to the nearest meter.\n\nHowever, since \u03c0 is an irrational number with infinite decimal places, and the conversion factor is exact (1 cubic meter = 1000 liters), the precision of the final answer is limited by the precision of the input values.\n\nGiven that the radius and height are both given to one significant figure, perhaps the final answer should also be reported to one significant figure.\n\nWait, but 3 meters could be considered as having one significant figure, while 4 meters could be considered as having one significant figure as well, since the trailing zero in 4 is not significant unless specified.\n\nBut in this case, both 3 and 4 are whole numbers, likely measured to the nearest meter, so perhaps the final answer should be reported to the same precision.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, water tanks are often designed with more precision, so maybe it's acceptable to keep more decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem provides a conversion factor of 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters, which is exact, and \u03c0 is a constant, perhaps it's best to report the answer with a reasonable number of decimal places, say, one decimal place.\n\nSo, 113,097.6 liters seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves measurements in meters, which are metric units, and the conversion to liters is straightforward, perhaps reporting the volume in liters without decimal places would be sufficient.\n\nIn that case, rounding 113,097.6 liters to the nearest liter gives 113,098 liters.\n\nBut, to be precise, I'll keep it as 113,097.6 liters.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the formula for the volume of a cylinder and directly multiply by the conversion factor.\n\nSo,\n\nV (in liters) = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h * 1000\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nV = 3.1416 * (3)^2 * 4 * 1000\n\nFirst, calculate r\u00b2: 3^2 = 9\n\nThen, 3.1416 * 9 = 28.2744\n\nThen, 28.2744 * 4 = 113.0976\n\nFinally, 113.0976 * 1000 = 113,097.6 liters\n\nSame result as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the exact value of \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1415926535, the calculation would be:\n\nV = 3.1415926535 * 9 * 4 * 1000\n\nV = 3.1415926535 * 36 * 1000\n\nV = 113,097.335526 liters\n\nAgain, approximately 113,097.6 liters.\n\nTherefore, the tank can hold about 113,097.6 liters of water when filled to capacity.\n\nBut, to make sure, perhaps I should consider the units throughout the calculation to ensure consistency.\n\nGiven that the radius is in meters and the height is in meters, the volume will be in cubic meters.\n\nThen, converting cubic meters to liters using the conversion factor is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the volume in cubic centimeters, since 1 liter is equal to 1000 cubic centimeters, but that would complicate things unnecessarily, as the given dimensions are in meters.\n\nWait, actually, 1 cubic meter is equal to 1,000,000 cubic centimeters, and 1 liter is equal to 1000 cubic centimeters, which is why 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters.\n\nBut sticking with meters and liters is more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the volume in cubic meters and then append the conversion to liters at the end.\n\nSo, volume in cubic meters is \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h.\n\nThen, multiply by 1000 to get liters.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to think in terms of centimeters, I would first convert the radius and height from meters to centimeters.\n\n1 meter = 100 centimeters.\n\nSo, radius = 3 m = 300 cm\n\nHeight = 4 m = 400 cm\n\nThen, volume in cubic centimeters would be:\n\nV = \u03c0 * (300 cm)^2 * 400 cm\n\nV = 3.1416 * 90,000 cm\u00b2 * 400 cm\n\nV = 3.1416 * 36,000,000 cm\u00b3\n\nV = 113,097,600 cm\u00b3\n\nSince 1 liter = 1000 cm\u00b3, then:\n\nV = 113,097,600 cm\u00b3 / 1000 = 113,097.6 liters\n\nSame result as before.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the volume comes out to be approximately 113,097.6 liters.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the exact value of \u03c0, the volume would be:\n\nV = \u03c0 * (3 m)^2 * 4 m * 1000 liters/m\u00b3\n\nV = \u03c0 * 9 m\u00b2 * 4 m * 1000\n\nV = \u03c0 * 36 m\u00b3 * 1000\n\nV = 36\u03c0 * 1000 liters\n\nV \u2248 36 * 3.1415926535 * 1000 \u2248 113,097.335526 liters\n\nWhich rounds to 113,097.6 liters.\n\nTherefore, the tank can hold approximately 113,097.6 liters of water when filled to capacity.\n\nBut, to be thorough, perhaps I should consider the thickness of the tank walls or any internal obstacles, but since no such information is provided, I'll assume the tank is a simple hollow cylinder with no thickness or internal structures.\n\nAdditionally, in real-world scenarios, water tanks may not be filled to the very top due to considerations like water expansion or to prevent overflow, but again, since no such specifications are given, I'll assume the tank is filled to its full capacity.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether the tank has a closed top or open top, but since the problem doesn't specify, and it's about holding water, I'll assume it's closed and can be filled to the brim.\n\nAlternatively, if the tank has an open top, it could still be filled to the top, so it shouldn't affect the volume calculation.\n\nFurthermore, I should ensure that the units are consistent throughout the calculation, which they are, as I'm using meters for radius and height, and then converting the volume from cubic meters to liters.\n\nAlternatively, if the tank has a different shape, like a hemisphere on top or bottom, but the problem specifies it's a cylinder, so I'll stick with the cylindrical volume formula.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the tank is lying on its side, but again, the problem states it's a cylindrical tank with a given radius and height, so I assume it's standing upright.\n\nTherefore, the volume calculation should be straightforward using the standard formula for a cylinder.\n\nIn conclusion, the tank can hold approximately 113,097.6 liters of water when filled to capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{113097.6} \\]"
