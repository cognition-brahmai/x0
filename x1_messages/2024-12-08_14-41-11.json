        "content": "So the shipping company wants to expand its fleet by building new cargo ships, and they have a budget for this project. Let's see what we need to figure out here.\n\nFirst, each new ship can carry up to 10,000 tons of cargo, and it costs $50 million to build one. The company has $200 million set aside for this expansion. I need to find out how many new ships they can build with that budget.\n\nTo find the maximum number of ships they can build, I should divide the total budget by the cost per ship. So, $200 million divided by $50 million per ship.\n\nLet me do the math: 200 \u00f7 50 = 4. So, they can build 4 new ships with their budget.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the total carrying capacity of the expanded fleet. The company currently operates 15 ships with an average carrying capacity of 8,000 tons each. They're adding 4 new ships, each with a capacity of 10,000 tons.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current total carrying capacity:\n\n15 ships \u00d7 8,000 tons per ship = 120,000 tons.\n\nNext, the capacity of the new ships:\n\n4 ships \u00d7 10,000 tons per ship = 40,000 tons.\n\nNow, add these two together to get the total carrying capacity of the expanded fleet:\n\n120,000 tons + 40,000 tons = 160,000 tons.\n\nSo, after expanding the fleet with 4 new ships, the total carrying capacity would be 160,000 tons.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider here? Maybe whether all the new ships can actually be built with the given budget. The cost is $50 million per ship, and the budget is $200 million, which allows for 4 ships as I calculated. But perhaps there are other costs involved, like crew, maintenance, or operational costs, but the question seems to focus only on the construction cost.\n\nAlso, the question mentions that each ship can carry up to 10,000 tons, but the current fleet has an average of 8,000 tons. Maybe I should consider if the new ships will be fully loaded, but the question asks for the total carrying capacity, so it's about the potential maximum capacity, not the actual loaded capacity.\n\nI think I've covered all the points here. The company can build 4 new ships within their $200 million budget, and the total carrying capacity of the expanded fleet would be 160,000 tons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160,000 \\text{ tons}} \\]"
