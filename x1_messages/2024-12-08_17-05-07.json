        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students studying physics and chemistry. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 30 students in total. Out of these, 15 are studying physics, 20 are studying chemistry, and 10 are studying both subjects. The question is, how many students are not studying either subject?\n\nOkay, to solve this, I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's something I learned for counting things without double-counting.\n\nSo, first, I'll find out how many students are studying either physics or chemistry or both. Then, I'll subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many are studying neither.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- P as the set of students studying physics.\n\n- C as the set of students studying chemistry.\n\nI know that:\n\n- The number of students in set P, |P|, is 15.\n\n- The number of students in set C, |C|, is 20.\n\n- The number of students studying both, |P \u2229 C|, is 10.\n\nI need to find the number of students studying either physics or chemistry or both, which is |P \u222a C|.\n\nAccording to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, |P \u222a C| = |P| + |C| - |P \u2229 C|.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|P \u222a C| = 15 + 20 - 10 = 25.\n\nSo, 25 students are studying either physics or chemistry or both.\n\nNow, to find the number of students not studying either subject, I'll subtract this number from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 30.\n\nStudents studying physics or chemistry or both = 25.\n\nTherefore, students studying neither = 30 - 25 = 5.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 15 are studying physics and 20 are studying chemistry, but 10 are studying both, then the total number studying at least one of the subjects is indeed 25, as calculated.\n\nAnd since there are 30 students in total, subtracting 25 leaves 5 students who are not studying either subject.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sets.\n\nThe number of students studying only physics would be |P| - |P \u2229 C| = 15 - 10 = 5.\n\nThe number of students studying only chemistry would be |C| - |P \u2229 C| = 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nThen, the number studying at least one subject is 5 (only physics) + 10 (only chemistry) + 10 (both) = 25.\n\nAgain, subtracting from total students: 30 - 25 = 5.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nMaybe using probability or some other method, but I think inclusion-exclusion is the most straightforward way for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nLet's draw a Venn diagram with two circles overlapping.\n\nOne circle represents physics students, the other represents chemistry students.\n\nThe overlapping area represents students studying both subjects, which is 10 students.\n\nThen, the part of the physics circle not overlapping is 15 - 10 = 5 students studying only physics.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the chemistry circle not overlapping is 20 - 10 = 10 students studying only chemistry.\n\nSo, adding up the parts: only physics (5) + only chemistry (10) + both (10) = 25 students studying at least one subject.\n\nTotal students are 30, so 30 - 25 = 5 students not studying either subject.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider?\n\nPerhaps I can check if there are students studying neither subject by subtracting the number studying at least one subject from the total.\n\nYes, that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, if I add the number studying physics and chemistry without subtracting the overlap, I get 15 + 20 = 35, which is more than the total number of students, indicating an overlap of 10 students, which is consistent with the given data.\n\nSo, again, |P \u222a C| = |P| + |C| - |P \u2229 C| = 15 + 20 - 10 = 25.\n\nStudents not studying either subject: 30 - 25 = 5.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any students studying other subjects.\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any other subjects, so I assume that physics and chemistry are the only subjects being considered here.\n\nTherefore, the 5 students not studying either are not studying physics or chemistry, but they might be studying other subjects not mentioned here.\n\nBut according to the question, we're only interested in whether they're studying physics or chemistry.\n\nSo, my final answer is 5 students are not studying either subject.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
