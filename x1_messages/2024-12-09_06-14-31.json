        "content": "So I've got this problem here about finding the most cost-effective route for a shipping company that needs to transport goods between three ports: A, B, and C. Each port has different docking and handling fees, and there are different distances between them with associated fuel costs. The goal is to figure out the route that minimizes the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given data to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nPorts and their docking fees:\n\n- Port A: $10,000 per docking\n\n- Port B: $15,000 per docking\n\n- Port C: $12,000 per docking\n\nDistances between ports:\n\n- A to B: 800 miles\n\n- B to C: 600 miles\n\n- A to C: 1,200 miles\n\nFuel cost: $3 per mile\n\nNow, the company needs to transport goods between these three ports. The problem doesn't specify the starting point or the ending point, so I'm assuming that the route can start at any port and needs to visit all three ports before ending at one of them. Essentially, it's like finding the optimal path in a triangle with three points.\n\nSince there are three ports, there are several possible routes to consider. Let's list them all out:\n\n1. A \u2192 B \u2192 C\n\n2. A \u2192 C \u2192 B\n\n3. B \u2192 A \u2192 C\n\n4. B \u2192 C \u2192 A\n\n5. C \u2192 A \u2192 B\n\n6. C \u2192 B \u2192 A\n\nAdditionally, depending on whether the route needs to return to the starting point or not, we might have to consider round trips, but the problem doesn't specify that. For now, I'll assume that the route is a single journey that starts at one port, visits the other two, and ends at the last port without returning.\n\nFor each route, we need to calculate the total cost, which includes both the docking fees and the fuel costs for the distances traveled.\n\nLet's start by calculating the cost for each possible route.\n\n**Route 1: A \u2192 B \u2192 C**\n\n- Docking at A: $10,000\n\n- Travel from A to B: 800 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $2,400\n\n- Docking at B: $15,000\n\n- Travel from B to C: 600 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $1,800\n\n- Docking at C: $12,000\n\n- Total cost: $10,000 + $2,400 + $15,000 + $1,800 + $12,000 = $41,200\n\n**Route 2: A \u2192 C \u2192 B**\n\n- Docking at A: $10,000\n\n- Travel from A to C: 1,200 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $3,600\n\n- Docking at C: $12,000\n\n- Travel from C to B: 600 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $1,800\n\n- Docking at B: $15,000\n\n- Total cost: $10,000 + $3,600 + $12,000 + $1,800 + $15,000 = $43,400\n\n**Route 3: B \u2192 A \u2192 C**\n\n- Docking at B: $15,000\n\n- Travel from B to A: 800 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $2,400\n\n- Docking at A: $10,000\n\n- Travel from A to C: 1,200 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $3,600\n\n- Docking at C: $12,000\n\n- Total cost: $15,000 + $2,400 + $10,000 + $3,600 + $12,000 = $43,000\n\n**Route 4: B \u2192 C \u2192 A**\n\n- Docking at B: $15,000\n\n- Travel from B to C: 600 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $1,800\n\n- Docking at C: $12,000\n\n- Travel from C to A: 1,200 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $3,600\n\n- Docking at A: $10,000\n\n- Total cost: $15,000 + $1,800 + $12,000 + $3,600 + $10,000 = $42,400\n\n**Route 5: C \u2192 A \u2192 B**\n\n- Docking at C: $12,000\n\n- Travel from C to A: 1,200 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $3,600\n\n- Docking at A: $10,000\n\n- Travel from A to B: 800 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $2,400\n\n- Docking at B: $15,000\n\n- Total cost: $12,000 + $3,600 + $10,000 + $2,400 + $15,000 = $43,000\n\n**Route 6: C \u2192 B \u2192 A**\n\n- Docking at C: $12,000\n\n- Travel from C to B: 600 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $1,800\n\n- Docking at B: $15,000\n\n- Travel from B to A: 800 miles \u00d7 $3/mile = $2,400\n\n- Docking at A: $10,000\n\n- Total cost: $12,000 + $1,800 + $15,000 + $2,400 + $10,000 = $41,200\n\nNow, let's summarize the total costs for each route:\n\n- Route 1: $41,200\n\n- Route 2: $43,400\n\n- Route 3: $43,000\n\n- Route 4: $42,400\n\n- Route 5: $43,000\n\n- Route 6: $41,200\n\nFrom this, the cheapest routes are Route 1 and Route 6, both costing $41,200.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think if there's a way to further optimize this. Maybe there's a way to reduce the number of dockings or optimize the travel distances.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that goods need to be transported between the three ports, presumably visiting each port once, we can assume that each port needs to be docked once.\n\nBut perhaps if we consider that the shipping company might be able to combine some operations or skip a docking in certain scenarios, but based on the problem statement, it seems necessary to dock at each port once.\n\nAnother consideration could be the direction of travel. Maybe traveling in one direction is more favorable due to factors like ocean currents, but the problem doesn't provide that information, so we'll assume that the distances given are accurate regardless of direction.\n\nAlso, the fuel cost is constant at $3 per mile, so the cost is directly proportional to the distance traveled.\n\nLooking back at the routes, Routes 1 and 6 have the same total cost. Let's see if there's any difference in their travel patterns.\n\nRoute 1: A \u2192 B \u2192 C\n\n- Total travel distance: 800 + 600 = 1,400 miles\n\nRoute 6: C \u2192 B \u2192 A\n\n- Total travel distance: 600 + 800 = 1,400 miles\n\nSo, the total distance traveled is the same for both routes, which makes sense why their total costs are equal.\n\nNow, is there a way to reduce the total distance traveled or the docking fees?\n\nOne thing to consider is whether any of the ports offer better fees if visited multiple times or any discounts, but again, the problem doesn't provide that information.\n\nAnother factor could be the time spent traveling and docked, but since the problem doesn't specify any time constraints or costs associated with time, we can ignore that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a direct route from A to C that is cheaper than going through B, but looking at the distances:\n\n- A to C directly: 1,200 miles\n\n- A to B to C: 800 + 600 = 1,400 miles\n\nThe direct A to C is shorter, but in Route 1 (A \u2192 B \u2192 C), the total distance is 1,400 miles, while direct A to C is 1,200 miles. However, in Route 1, there is an additional docking at B, which might be necessary if operations at B are required.\n\nBut the problem states that goods are being transported between the three ports, so perhaps visiting all three is mandatory.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"transporting goods between three major ports (A, B, and C).\" It's a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that goods are being shipped from one port to another via the third, or that goods need to be transported in a sequence involving all three ports?\n\nUpon closer reading, it seems that the shipping company needs to transport goods between these three ports, and in doing so, they need to determine the most efficient route considering the costs at each port and the distances between them.\n\nGiven that, and assuming that the goods need to pass through all three ports in some order, then the approach of considering all possible routes and selecting the one with the lowest total cost seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if the goods are being shipped from one specific port to another and can choose which port to stop at en route, then the starting and ending points would be specified.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the starting and ending points, I think the assumption that the route can start at any port and needs to visit all three ports before ending at one of them is valid.\n\nGiven that, and based on the cost calculations, Routes 1 (A \u2192 B \u2192 C) and Route 6 (C \u2192 B \u2192 A) both have the lowest total cost of $41,200.\n\nTherefore, the most cost-effective routes are A \u2192 B \u2192 C and C \u2192 B \u2192 A.\n\nBut to ensure that this is indeed the most cost-effective, perhaps there's a way to further reduce costs by optimizing docking fees or distances.\n\nLet's consider if there's any possibility of reducing docking fees by negotiating or by docking at a port less frequently, but again, based on the given information, the docking fees are fixed.\n\nAnother consideration could be the capacity of the shipping vessel. If the vessel can carry all the goods without needing to dock at intermediate ports, then perhaps a direct route from starting point to ending point would be more efficient.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that goods are being transported between the three ports, and presumably need to be handled at each port, it's necessary to dock at all three.\n\nAlternatively, if some of the goods can be transferred directly without docking at intermediate ports, but without more information, it's hard to make that assumption.\n\nGiven the available information, and based on the calculations, Routes 1 and 6 are the most cost-effective.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider if there's any possibility of combining routes or skipping dockings, but that seems unlikely given the problem constraints.\n\nTherefore, the most cost-effective routes are A \u2192 B \u2192 C and C \u2192 B \u2192 A, both with a total cost of $41,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41200} \\]"
