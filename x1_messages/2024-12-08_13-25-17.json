        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a hotel chain that's planning to open a new resort with 500 rooms, multiple restaurants, swimming pools, and other facilities. The total construction cost is estimated at $150 million, plus an additional $30 million for interior decoration and furnishing. That means the total investment is $150 million + $30 million = $180 million.\n\nNow, the company expects an annual occupancy rate of 70% and an average room rate of $300 per night. We need to calculate the expected revenue and the payback period for this investment.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected annual revenue from the rooms. To do that, we need to find out how many room-nights are sold in a year.\n\nWe know there are 500 rooms, and the occupancy rate is 70%. So, the number of occupied rooms per night is 500 * 0.7 = 350 rooms.\n\nThere are 365 days in a year, so the total number of room-nights sold in a year is 350 rooms * 365 days = 127,750 room-nights.\n\nAt an average room rate of $300 per night, the revenue from rooms would be 127,750 * $300 = $38,325,000.\n\nBut wait, that seems too low. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nYes, 500 rooms * 70% occupancy = 350 occupied rooms per night.\n\n350 rooms * 365 days = 127,750 room-nights per year.\n\n127,750 room-nights * $300 per night = $38,325,000.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But I feel like hotel revenues are usually higher. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nOh, right! Hotels often have other sources of revenue besides just room sales. There are restaurants, spas, conference facilities, shopping, and other amenities. In this case, the resort has multiple restaurants and swimming pools, so there should be additional revenue from these sources.\n\nBut the problem only provides data on the number of rooms and their rates, and doesn't specify the expected revenue from other facilities. So, perhaps for the purpose of this calculation, we should only consider room revenue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the room rate already includes other services or expenses, but that's not specified. I'll proceed with the information given and assume that only room revenue is considered.\n\nSo, annual room revenue is $38,325,000.\n\nNow, to find the payback period, we need to divide the total investment by the annual revenue.\n\nTotal investment is $180 million, and annual revenue is $38,325,000.\n\nPayback period = $180,000,000 / $38,325,000 \u2248 4.7 years.\n\nBut again, I have a
