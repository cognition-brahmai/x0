        "content": "The heliocentric model of the universe, which posits that the Sun is at the center and the planets orbit around it, was first proposed by the ancient Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BCE. However, his ideas were not widely accepted during his time, and the geocentric model proposed by Ptolemy, with Earth at the center, remained the dominant view until the 16th century. It was later revived and refined by Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei, among others, who provided stronger evidence and mathematical support for the heliocentric model."
