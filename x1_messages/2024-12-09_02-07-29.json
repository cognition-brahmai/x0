        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a Java program that uses multithreading to calculate the sum of even and odd numbers separately within a given range. We'll use two threads for this purpose: one for summing even numbers and another for summing odd numbers.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the basics of multithreading in Java. Java provides several ways to create threads, but for simplicity, we'll use anonymous inner classes to create our threads.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the range of integers:** Let's say the user provides a starting and ending integer.\n\n2. **Create two threads:**\n   - One thread will sum all even numbers within the range.\n   - The other thread will sum all odd numbers within the range.\n\n3. **Synchronize the threads:** Ensure that the main program waits for both threads to complete before displaying the results.\n\n4. **Display the results:** Once both threads have finished their computations, print out the sums of even and odd numbers.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the `Thread` class and the `join()` method to wait for threads to complete.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Java program that uses multithreading to calculate the sum of all even numbers and the sum of all odd numbers separately within a given range of integers. The program will display the results once both threads have completed their tasks.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Define the Range:** The user provides a starting and ending integer.\n2. **Create Two Threads:**\n   - One thread will sum all even numbers within the range.\n   - Another thread will sum all odd numbers within the range.\n3. **Synchronize the Threads:** Use the `join()` method to ensure the main program waits for both threads to complete.\n4. **Display the Results:** Print the sums of even and odd numbers after both threads have finished.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nclass SumEven extends Thread {\n    private int start;\n    private int end;\n    private long sum;\n\n    public SumEven(int start, int end) {\n        this.start = start;\n        this.end = end;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {\n            if (i % 2 == 0) {\n                sum += i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public long getSum() {\n        return sum;\n    }\n}\n\nclass SumOdd extends Thread {\n    private int start;\n    private int end;\n    private long sum;\n\n    public SumOdd(int start, int end) {\n        this.start = start;\n        this.end = end;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {\n            if (i % 2 != 0) {\n                sum += i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public long getSum() {\n        return sum;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int start = 1;\n        int end = 100;\n\n        SumEven evenThread = new SumEven(start, end);\n        SumOdd oddThread = new SumOdd(start, end);\n\n        evenThread.start();\n        oddThread.start();\n\n        try {\n            evenThread.join();\n            oddThread.join();\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Sum of even numbers: \" + evenThread.getSum());\n        System.out.println(\"Sum of odd numbers: \" + oddThread.getSum());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **SumEven and SumOdd Classes:**\n   - These are subclasses of `Thread` that calculate the sum of even and odd numbers respectively within the given range.\n   - Each class has a `run` method that iterates through the range and accumulates the sum of numbers that meet the criteria (even or odd).\n   - A `getSum` method is provided to retrieve the computed sum.\n\n2. **Main Class:**\n   - Defines the range of integers (e.g., 1 to 100).\n   - Creates instances of `SumEven` and `SumOdd` threads.\n   - Starts both threads.\n   - Uses `join()` to wait for both threads to complete.\n   - Prints the sums obtained from both threads once they have finished executing.\n\nThis approach ensures that the sums are calculated concurrently, demonstrating the use of multithreading in Java."
