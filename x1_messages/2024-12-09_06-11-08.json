        "content": "So, the train normally travels at 60 miles per hour and it takes 4 hours to go between two cities. If it doubles its speed for the return trip, how long would that take?\n\nFirst, I need to find out the distance between the two cities. Since speed is constant at 60 mph and it takes 4 hours, distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance is 60 miles per hour times 4 hours, which is 240 miles.\n\nNow, for the return trip, the speed doubles. So, double of 60 mph is 120 mph.\n\nTo find out the time it takes to travel back at 120 mph over 240 miles, I can use the formula: time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nSo, time is 240 miles divided by 120 mph, which is 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, it would take 2 hours for the train to travel back at double the speed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
