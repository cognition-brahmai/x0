        "content": "So the factory makes 250 units of product A and 150 units of product B each day. We need to find out how many days it will take to produce 2000 units of A and 1200 units of B. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's see how many days it would take to produce 2000 units of product A alone. If they make 250 units per day, then the number of days for A would be 2000 divided by 250. That's 2000 \u00f7 250 = 8 days.\n\nNext, for product B, they produce 150 units per day. So, to make 1200 units of B, it would take 1200 \u00f7 150 = 8 days.\n\nWait a minute, both products take 8 days to reach their respective targets. So, if the factory produces both products every day, in 8 days, they would have produced exactly 2000 units of A and 1200 units of B.\n\nBut let's double-check this. In 8 days:\n\n- For A: 250 units/day \u00d7 8 days = 2000 units\n\n- For B: 150 units/day \u00d7 8 days = 1200 units\n\nPerfect, that matches exactly what we need.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory could choose to prioritize one product over the other, but the question doesn't specify that, so we'll assume they produce both products every day as usual.\n\nSo, the answer is 8 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
