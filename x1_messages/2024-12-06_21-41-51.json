        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company charges $20 per day for renting a car, and also 15 cents per mile driven. The person is renting the car for 5 days and driving it for 300 miles. I need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for renting the car for 5 days. That should be straightforward: $20 per day times 5 days.\n\n$20 * 5 = $100\n\nSo, the rental cost is $100.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 300 miles. The charge is 15 cents per mile. So, 15 cents times 300 miles.\n\nBut wait, 15 cents is the same as $0.15. So, it's $0.15 per mile.\n\n$0.15 * 300 = $45\n\nSo, the mileage cost is $45.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I'll add the rental cost and the mileage cost together.\n\n$100 + $45 = $145\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $145.\n\nJust to double-check, let me verify the calculations.\n\nRental cost: $20 per day * 5 days = $100\n\nMileage cost: $0.15 per mile * 300 miles = $45\n\nTotal cost: $100 + $45 = $145\n\nEverything seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{145} \\]"
