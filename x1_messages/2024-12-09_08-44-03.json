        "content": "So I've got this function, f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1, and I need to find its derivative, f'(x). I'm a bit rusty on my calculus, but I think I can handle this. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I recall that the derivative of a function gives me the slope of the tangent line at any point on the function's graph. To find f'(x), I need to apply the power rule to each term of f(x). The power rule says that if I have a term like ax^n, where a is a constant and n is a real number, then the derivative is a*n*x^(n-1).\n\nOkay, let's apply that to each term in f(x).\n\nStarting with x^3:\n\nThe coefficient a is 1, and the exponent n is 3. So, the derivative is 1*3*x^(3-1) = 3x^2.\n\nNext, 2x^2:\n\nHere, a is 2 and n is 2. So, the derivative is 2*2*x^(2-1) = 4x.\n\nNow, -5x:\n\nThe coefficient a is -5, and the exponent n is 1 (since x is the same as x^1). So, the derivative is -5*1*x^(1-1) = -5*1*x^0 = -5*1*1 = -5. Remember that x^0 is 1.\n\nLastly, the constant term +1:\n\nThe derivative of a constant is zero because the slope of a horizontal line is zero.\n\nPutting it all together, f'(x) should be:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5\n\nLet me double-check that I didn't miss anything. Each term was differentiated correctly according to the power rule, and the constant term's derivative is zero. So, I think that's the correct derivative.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use the definition of the derivative to verify this. The definition of the derivative is:\n\nf'(x) = lim(h->0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h\n\nBut that would be more time-consuming, and since I applied the power rule correctly, I think it's safe to stay with f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3x^2 + 4x - 5} \\]"
