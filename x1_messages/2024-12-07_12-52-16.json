        "content": "I'm here to help with your question about genetic disorders. Let's look at three examples: cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia. I'll present the information in a CSV format as you requested.\n\n\"Disorder\",\"Symptoms\",\"Inheritance Pattern\"\n\n\"Cystic Fibrosis\",\"- Persistent lung infections\n\n- Very salty-tasting skin\n\n- Poor growth/weight gain in childhood\n\n- Frequent greasy, bulky stools or difficulty passing stool\n\n- Pancreatitis\n\n- Infertility, particularly in men\",\"Autosomal Recessive\"\n\n\"Huntington's Disease\",\"- Uncontrolled movements\n\n- Impairment in the ability to think\n\n- Personality changes, depression, and other psychiatric symptoms\",\"Autosomal Dominant\"\n\n\"Sickle Cell Anemia\",\"- Anemia\n\n- Episodes of pain\n\n- Swelling in hands and feet\n\n- Frequent infections\n\n- Delayed growth and puberty\n\n- Vision problems\",\"Autosomal Recessive\"\n\nLet me explain a bit more about each one.\n\nCystic Fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which affects the body's ability to regulate salt and water content. This leads to the production of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs and digestive system, causing infections and other complications. It's inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both parents must carry the mutated gene for their child to be affected.\n\nHuntington's Disease results from a mutation in the HTT gene, leading to the production of an abnormal huntingtin protein that causes nerve cells in the brain to degenerate over time. Symptoms usually appear in midlife and worsen over time. It's inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, so only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder.\n\nSickle Cell Anemia is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which affects hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This mutation causes red blood cells to become rigid and sticky, forming into a sickle shape, which can get stuck in blood vessels and decrease blood flow. Like cystic fibrosis, it's inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
