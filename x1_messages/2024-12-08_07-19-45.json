        "content": "So John reads 30 pages per day and Jane reads 50 pages per day. The book has 450 pages. I need to find out who finishes first and by how many days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days it takes for each of them to finish the book.\n\nFor John:\n\nHe reads 30 pages per day. So, to read 450 pages, the number of days he needs is 450 divided by 30.\n\n450 \u00f7 30 = 15 days.\n\nFor Jane:\n\nShe reads 50 pages per day. So, to read 450 pages, the number of days she needs is 450 divided by 50.\n\n450 \u00f7 50 = 9 days.\n\nSo, Jane finishes in 9 days, and John finishes in 15 days.\n\nTo find out by how many days Jane finishes earlier:\n\n15 days (John) - 9 days (Jane) = 6 days.\n\nTherefore, Jane finishes reading the book first, 6 days before John.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, do they read every day without stopping? Or are there any holidays or something that might affect their reading schedule? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume they read every day without breaks.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the division is exact. Let's check:\n\nFor John: 30 pages/day \u00d7 15 days = 450 pages. Perfect.\n\nFor Jane: 50 pages/day \u00d7 9 days = 450 pages. Also perfect.\n\nSo, no partial days or anything like that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that maybe sometimes they might read more or less on certain days, but since the problem states their regular reading pace, I think using the average daily reading is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that Jane finishes first, 6 days before John.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
