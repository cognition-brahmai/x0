        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a jar with a mixture of 3 liters of water and 5 liters of juice. I need to find out what percentage of the mixture is juice. Hmm, percentages can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a percentage is. Percentage means \"per hundred,\" so it's a way of expressing a part of a whole in terms of 100. So, if I have a part (which is the juice) and a whole (which is the total mixture), I can find out what part of the whole the juice makes up, and then express that as a percentage.\n\nOkay, so the first thing I need to do is find out the total volume of the mixture. That should be the sum of the water and the juice. There's 3 liters of water and 5 liters of juice, so total mixture is 3 + 5 = 8 liters.\n\nNow, I need to find out what part of this 8-liter mixture is juice. The juice is 5 liters, so the part that's juice is 5 liters out of 8 liters. To find the percentage, I need to express this as a fraction and then convert it to a percentage.\n\nSo, the fraction of the mixture that is juice is 5/8. To convert this fraction to a percentage, I can multiply it by 100. So, (5/8) * 100 should give me the percentage.\n\nLet me do the math here. 5 divided by 8 is 0.625. Then, 0.625 multiplied by 100 is 62.5%. So, the juice makes up 62.5% of the mixture.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the total mixture is 8 liters and juice is 5 liters, then yes, 5 is exactly 62.5% of 8. Let me confirm this with another method to be sure.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for percentage: (part/whole) * 100. Here, the part is juice, which is 5 liters, and the whole is the total mixture, which is 8 liters. So, (5/8) * 100 = 62.5%.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of decimals. 5 divided by 8 is 0.625, and to express that as a percentage, I move the decimal point two places to the right, which gives me 62.5%.\n\nYet another way to verify this is to consider that 50% of 8 liters would be 4 liters, since 50% is half. But we have 5 liters of juice, which is more than half. So, it makes sense that it's 62.5%, which is more than 50%.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of ratios. The ratio of juice to total mixture is 5:8. To find the percentage, I can set up a proportion: 5/8 = x/100. Then, solving for x gives me x = (5/8)*100 = 62.5%.\n\nWait, I'm basically repeating the same calculation, but it's good to see that I'm getting consistent results. It reinforces that 62.5% is the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a chance that the question is asking for something else, like the percentage of water or maybe the concentration of juice in terms of volume?\n\nNo, the question clearly states that there are 3 liters of water and 5 liters of juice, and it asks for the percentage of the mixture that is juice. So, I think I've got it right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check the percentage of water as well. If juice is 5 liters out of 8, then water is 3 liters out of 8. So, (3/8)*100 = 37.5%. And indeed, 62.5% + 37.5% equals 100%, which makes sense because together they make up the entire mixture.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that juice is more than half of the mixture, since 5 out of 8 is more than 4 out of 8, which would be 50%. 62.5% is indeed more than 50%, so that checks out.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 62.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62.5\\%} \\]"
