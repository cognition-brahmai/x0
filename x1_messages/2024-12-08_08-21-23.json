        "content": "Let's see. So, Tom weighs twice as much as his sister Mary, and together they weigh 210 pounds. I need to find out how much Tom weighs.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to their weights. Let's say Mary's weight is M pounds. Since Tom weighs twice as much as Mary, Tom's weight would be 2M pounds.\n\nNow, together they weigh 210 pounds, so Mary's weight plus Tom's weight equals 210. That means M + 2M = 210.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 3M = 210.\n\nTo find M, I need to divide both sides by 3. So, M = 210 / 3 = 70 pounds.\n\nNow, since Tom weighs twice as much as Mary, Tom's weight is 2 * 70 = 140 pounds.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If Mary weighs 70 pounds and Tom weighs 140 pounds, together they weigh 70 + 140 = 210 pounds, which matches the given information.\n\nSo, Tom weighs 140 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
