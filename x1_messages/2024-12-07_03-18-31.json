However, I must clarify that deriving the Black-Scholes formula is a complex task that involves advanced mathematical concepts, including stochastic calculus and partial differential equations. If you're not familiar with these topics, some parts of the derivation might be challenging to understand. That being said, I'll do my best to explain each step in a clear and concise manner.\n\nSo, let's dive into the derivation of the Black-Scholes formula for European call and put options.\n\n### Assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model\n\nBefore we begin, it's essential to understand the assumptions underlying the Black-Scholes model:\n\n1. **No Arbitrage:** There are no risk-free opportunities to make a profit.\n2. **Efficient Market:** All information is immediately reflected in stock prices.\n3. **Known Volatility:** The volatility of the underlying asset is constant.\n4. **No Dividends:** The underlying asset does not pay dividends during the life of the option.\n5. **Continuous Trading:** The underlying asset can be bought and sold at any time.\n6. **Borrowing and Lending:** Investors can borrow and lend money at the risk-free interest rate.\n\n### Derivation of the Black-Scholes Equation\n\nThe Black-Scholes equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how the price of an option evolves over time. Let's denote:\n\n- \\( V \\): the price of the option\n- \\( S \\): the price of the underlying asset\n- \\( t \\): time\n- \\( r \\): the risk-free interest rate\n- \\( \\sigma \\): the volatility of the underlying asset\n\nThe Black-Scholes PDE is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + r S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - r V = 0\n\\]\n\nTo derive this equation, we'll use the concept of a risk-neutral portfolio.\n\n#### Step 1: Constructing a Risk-Neutral Portfolio\n\nConsider a portfolio consisting of the option and a certain amount of the underlying asset. Let\u2019s denote the number of shares of the underlying asset held in the portfolio as \\( \\Delta \\). The value of the portfolio \\( \\Pi \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\Pi = V - \\Delta S\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to choose \\( \\Delta \\) such that the portfolio is risk-free. In other words, the portfolio's value should not be affected by small changes in the underlying asset's price.\n\n#### Step 2: Applying Ito's Lemma\n\nThe price of the underlying asset \\( S \\) is assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion:\n\n\\[\ndS = \\mu S dt + \\sigma S dW\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the expected return of the asset, \\( \\sigma \\) is the volatility, and \\( dW \\) is a Wiener process.\n\nThe option price \\( V \\) is a function of \\( S \\) and \\( t \\), so we can apply Ito's lemma to find \\( dV \\):\n\n\\[\ndV = \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\mu S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} \\right) dt + \\sigma S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} dW\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Making the Portfolio Risk-Free\n\nThe portfolio \\( \\Pi \\) should be risk-free, meaning its change in value should be equal to the risk-free interest rate times its value:\n\n\\[\nd\\Pi = r \\Pi dt\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\Pi = V - \\Delta S \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\ndV - \\Delta dS = r (V - \\Delta S) dt\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for \\( dV \\) and \\( dS \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\mu S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} \\right) dt + \\sigma S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} dW - \\Delta (\\mu S dt + \\sigma S dW) = r (V - \\Delta S) dt\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Eliminating the Stochastic Term\n\nTo eliminate the stochastic term \\( dW \\), set the coefficient of \\( dW \\) to zero:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - \\Delta \\sigma S = 0 \\implies \\Delta = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}\n\\]\n\nThis choice of \\( \\Delta \\) makes the portfolio risk-free.\n\n#### Step 5: Deriving the Black-Scholes PDE\n\nSubstitute \\( \\Delta = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} \\) back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\mu S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} \\right) dt - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} (\\mu S dt + \\sigma S dW) = r \\left( V - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} S \\right) dt\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\mu S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} - \\mu S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - \\sigma S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} dW \\right) = r \\left( V - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} S \\right) dt\n\\]\n\nSince we've already set the coefficient of \\( dW \\) to zero, we're left with:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} \\right) dt = r \\left( V - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} S \\right) dt\n\\]\n\nCancel \\( dt \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} = r V - r S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}\n\\]\n\nRearrange the terms to get the Black-Scholes PDE:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + r S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - r V = 0\n\\]\n\n### Solving the Black-Scholes PDE\n\nTo solve this PDE, we need to specify the boundary conditions, which depend on the type of option (call or put) and its strike price \\( K \\).\n\n#### European Call Option\n\nFor a European call option, the payoff at expiration \\( t = T \\) is:\n\n\\[\nV(S, T) = \\max(S - K, 0)\n\\]\n\n#### European Put Option\n\nFor a European put option, the payoff at expiration \\( t = T \\) is:\n\n\\[\nV(S, T) = \\max(K - S, 0)\n\\]\n\n### Solution Using Risk-Neutral Pricing\n\nThe Black-Scholes formula can be derived using risk-neutral pricing. Under the risk-neutral measure, the expected return on the underlying asset is the risk-free rate \\( r \\). Therefore, the drift term \\( \\mu \\) in the geometric Brownian motion is replaced by \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\ndS = r S dt + \\sigma S dW^Q\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( W^Q \\) is a Wiener process under the risk-neutral measure.\n\nThe price of the option is the discounted expected value of its payoff under the risk-neutral measure:\n\n\\[\nV(S, t) = e^{-r(T - t)} E^Q [ h(S_T) ]\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( h(S_T) \\) is the payoff function at expiration.\n\n#### For a European Call Option:\n\n\\[\nV(S, t) = e^{-r(T - t)} E^Q [ (S_T - K)^+ ]\n\\]\n\n#### For a European Put Option:\n\n\\[\nV(S, t) = e^{-r(T - t)} E^Q [ (K - S_T)^+ ]\n\\]\n\n### Computing the Expected Values\n\nTo compute these expected values, we need the risk-neutral distribution of \\( S_T \\). Under the risk-neutral measure, \\( S_T \\) follows a lognormal distribution:\n\n\\[\nS_T = S_t e^{(r - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2)(T - t) + \\sigma \\sqrt{T - t} Z}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Z \\) is a standard normal random variable.\n\n#### For a European Call Option:\n\n\\[\nV(S, t) = e^{-r(T - t)} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (S_T - K)^+ \\phi(z) dz\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the standard normal density function.\n\nThis integral can be solved to obtain the Black-Scholes formula for a call option:\n\n\\[\nC(S, t) = S N(d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2)\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{S}{K}) + (r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})(T - t)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}\n\\]\n\nand \\( N(\\cdot) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\n#### For a European Put Option:\n\nUsing put-call parity, the put option price can be expressed in terms of the call option price:\n\n\\[\nP(S, t) = C(S, t) - S + K e^{-r(T - t)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the call option price:\n\n\\[\nP(S, t) = S N(d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2) - S + K e^{-r(T - t)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(S, t) = -S (1 - N(d_1)) + K e^{-r(T - t)} (1 - N(d_2))\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(S, t) = S N(-d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(-d_2)\n\\]\n\n### Summary of the Black-Scholes Formulas\n\n#### Call Option:\n\n\\[\nC(S, t) = S N(d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2)\n\\]\n\n#### Put Option:\n\n\\[\nP(S, t) = S N(-d_1) - K e^{-r(T - t)} N(-d_2)\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{S}{K}) + (r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})(T - t)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}\n\\]\n\n### Interpretation\n\nThe Black-Scholes formula provides a way to determine the fair price of a European call or put option based on the current stock price, the option's strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility of the underlying stock.\n\n- **\\( S \\)**: The current price of the underlying asset.\n- **\\( K \\)**: The strike price of the option.\n- **\\( T - t \\)**: The time remaining until expiration.\n- **\\( r \\)**: The risk-free interest rate.\n- **\\( \\sigma \\)**: The volatility of the underlying asset.\n\nThe formula takes into account the probability that the option will be in the money at expiration, adjusted for the time value of money.\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile the Black-Scholes model is widely used, it has several limitations:\n\n1. **Assumes constant volatility**, which is not observed in real markets where volatility can change over time.\n2. **Assumes no dividends**, which may not hold for stocks that pay dividends.\n3. **Assumes European-style options**, which can only be exercised at expiration, whereas many options can be exercised before expiration.\n4. **Assumes frictionless markets** with no transaction costs or taxes.\n\nDespite these limitations, the Black-Scholes model remains a fundamental tool in option pricing and financial mathematics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Black-Scholes formula is a cornerstone in the field of financial derivatives. By understanding its derivation and assumptions, you can better appreciate its applications and limitations in pricing options and managing financial risk.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the derivation, feel free to ask!\n\n### References\n\n- Black, F., & Scholes, M.
