        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a store selling apples and oranges by the pound. Apples are $1.50 per pound, and oranges are $2.00 per pound. The customer is buying 3 pounds of apples and 4 pounds of oranges. We need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much the apples cost. Since apples are $1.50 per pound and the customer is buying 3 pounds, I can multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds. So, that's $1.50 times 3.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n$1.50 \u00d7 3 = $4.50\n\nSo, the apples will cost $4.50.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $2.00 per pound, and the customer is buying 4 pounds. Again, I'll multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds.\n\n$2.00 \u00d7 4 = $8.00\n\nSo, the oranges will cost $8.00.\n\nNow, to find the total amount the customer will spend, I need to add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together.\n\n$4.50 + $8.00 = $12.50\n\nTherefore, the customer will spend $12.50 in total.\n\nTo make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, apples: $1.50 per pound \u00d7 3 pounds = $4.50. That seems correct.\n\nOranges: $2.00 per pound \u00d7 4 pounds = $8.00. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding those together: $4.50 + $8.00 = $12.50. Yeah, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the total weight, but since the prices are different for apples and oranges, it's important to calculate each separately and then add them up.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total cost as a sum of two products: the price per pound of each fruit multiplied by the number of pounds bought.\n\nSo, total cost = (price per pound of apples \u00d7 pounds of apples) + (price per pound of oranges \u00d7 pounds of oranges)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal cost = ($1.50 \u00d7 3) + ($2.00 \u00d7 4) = $4.50 + $8.00 = $12.50\n\nIt's the same result. I think I've got it right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any discounts or additional fees, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't mix up the prices or the quantities. Apples are $1.50 per pound, not oranges, and the customer is buying 3 pounds of apples and 4 pounds of oranges. Everything seems to be in order.\n\nSo, the final answer is $12.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.50} \\]"
