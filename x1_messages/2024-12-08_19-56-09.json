You're one of my best friends, and I should have remembered something as important as your special day.\n\nI've been so caught up with Quidditch practice and homework that I completely lost track of time. Plus, with all the chaos at Hogwarts lately, my mind has been elsewhere. But that's no excuse for forgetting about you.\n\nI promise to make it up to you. Maybe we can have a small celebration now, just the two of us. We can go to Hogsmeade and grab a butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks, or maybe play some wizard's chess in the common room. Whatever you'd like!\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for being forgetful. Please accept my apology and let me know how I can make it right.\n\nYour friend,\n\nHarry Potter"
