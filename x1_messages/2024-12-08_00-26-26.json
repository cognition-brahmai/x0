        "content": "So, in this village, there are 200 houses, and each house has either a cat or a dog as a pet. There are 120 cats and 80 dogs in total. We need to find the probability that if we pick a house at random, it will have a cat.\n\nProbability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking a house with a cat, and the total possible outcomes are the total number of houses.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking a house with a cat is:\n\nP(cat) = Number of houses with cats / Total number of houses\n\nWe know there are 120 houses with cats and 200 houses in total.\n\nSo, P(cat) = 120 / 200\n\nNow, we can simplify this fraction.\n\nBoth 120 and 200 can be divided by 40.\n\n120 \u00f7 40 = 3\n\n200 \u00f7 40 = 5\n\nSo, P(cat) = 3/5\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal.\n\n3 divided by 5 is 0.6.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.6, or 60%.\n\nTherefore, there's a 60% chance that a randomly chosen house will have a cat.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.6} \\]"
