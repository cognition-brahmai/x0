        "content": "The traditional Italian limoncello liqueur is made from lemons, specifically the Sorrento lemon (Citrus limon). These lemons are known for their thick, bright yellow skin and are primarily grown in the region around Sorrento, Italy. The zest of these lemons is used to infuse the alcohol in limoncello, giving it its characteristic lemon flavor. It's important to note that while limoncello is associated with lemons, there are variations that might use other citrus fruits, but the classic version sticks to lemons."
