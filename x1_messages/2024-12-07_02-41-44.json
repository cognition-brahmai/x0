        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the store sells apples and oranges, and the ratio of apples to oranges sold is 3:2. Also, the total number of fruits sold is 750. We need to find out how many apples and how many oranges were sold.\n\nFirst, what does the ratio 3:2 mean? It means that for every 3 apples sold, there are 2 oranges sold. So, the apples and oranges are being sold in sets of 3 and 2 respectively.\n\nNow, let's think about this in terms of parts. If apples are 3 parts and oranges are 2 parts, then the total parts of fruits sold are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nGiven that the total number of fruits sold is 750, these 750 fruits are divided into 5 parts. So, to find out how many fruits are in one part, we can divide 750 by 5.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 750 divided by 5 is 150. So, one part consists of 150 fruits.\n\nNow, since apples are 3 parts, the number of apples sold would be 3 times 150, and oranges are 2 parts, so the number of oranges sold would be 2 times 150.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nApples: 3 * 150 = 450\n\nOranges: 2 * 150 = 300\n\nSo, the store sold 450 apples and 300 oranges.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that to make sure it adds up to 750.\n\n450 apples + 300 oranges = 750 fruits. Yes, that matches the total given.\n\nAlso, let's confirm the ratio:\n\nApples to oranges is 450:300. If we simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by 150, we get 3:2, which matches the given ratio.\n\nSo, our answer seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this problem using algebra. Let\u2019s say the number of apples sold is 3x and the number of oranges sold is 2x, where x is a multiplier.\n\nThen, the total fruits sold would be 3x + 2x = 5x, and we know that 5x = 750.\n\nSolving for x: x = 750 / 5 = 150.\n\nTherefore, apples sold = 3x = 3*150 = 450\n\nOranges sold = 2x = 2*150 = 300\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nI could also have used proportions to solve this. The ratio of apples to total fruits should be 3/(3+2) = 3/5, and the ratio of oranges to total fruits should be 2/(3+2) = 2/5.\n\nSo, the number of apples sold is (3/5)*750 = 450\n\nAnd the number of oranges sold is (2/5)*750 = 300\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nIt\u2019s good to see that no matter which method I use, I get the same answer. This reinforces that 450 apples and 300 oranges were sold.\n\nI think that\u2019s it. The problem is solved.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450 \\text{ apples and } 300 \\text{ oranges}} \\]"
