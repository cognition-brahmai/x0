In fact, no U.S. President who served during the Civil War was a general in that conflict. However, it's worth noting that Ulysses S. Grant, who became the 18th President of the United States, was a prominent general during the Civil War. He served as the commander of the Union Army and played a crucial role in bringing about the end of the war. So, while Lincoln was the President during the Civil War, it was Grant who held the position of a general in that war and later became President."
