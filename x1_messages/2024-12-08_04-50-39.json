        "content": "To develop a Golang command-line tool that fetches HTML content from a given URL and extracts all the links present in the page, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Go environment:** Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Create a new Go file:** Let's name it `linkextractor.go`.\n\n3. **Import necessary packages:** You will need packages to handle command-line arguments, make HTTP requests, parse HTML, and work with regular expressions.\n\n4. **Fetch the HTML content:** Use the `net/http` package to make an HTTP GET request to the provided URL and read the response body.\n\n5. **Extract links:** Use regular expressions to find all `<a>` tags and extract their `href` attributes.\n\n6. **Print the extracted links:** Iterate through the extracted links and print them to the console.\n\nHere is a sample implementation:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"regexp\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tif len(os.Args) != 2 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Usage: go run linkextractor.go <URL>\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\turl := os.Args[1]\n\n\t// Make HTTP GET request\n\tresp, err := http.Get(url)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Error making HTTP request: %v\\n\", err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tdefer resp.Body.Close()\n\n\t// Read the response body\n\tbody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Error reading response body: %v\\n\", err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// Define regex pattern to match <a> tags and capture href attributes\n\tlinkRegex := regexp.MustCompile(`href=[\"'](.*?)[\"']`)\n\n\t// Find all matches\n\tmatches := linkRegex.FindAllStringSubmatch(string(body), -1)\n\n\t// Print the extracted links\n\tfor _, match := range matches {\n\t\tif len(match) > 1 {\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(match[1])\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Command-Line Arguments:** The program expects one command-line argument, which is the URL to fetch.\n\n2. **HTTP Request:** It uses `http.Get` to fetch the HTML content from the provided URL.\n\n3. **Reading Response Body:** The response body is read into a byte slice using `ioutil.ReadAll`.\n\n4. **Regular Expression:** A regex pattern is used to match `<a>` tags and capture their `href` attributes.\n\n5. **Extract and Print Links:** All matches are extracted and printed to the console.\n\n### How to Run:\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `linkextractor.go`.\n\n2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.\n\n3. Run the command:\n   ```sh\n   go run linkextractor.go https://example.com\n   ```\n\nThis will fetch the HTML content from `https://example.com` and print all the links found in the page.\n\n### Note:\n\n- This is a basic implementation and may not handle all edge cases or handle relative URLs properly.\n\n- For more robust HTML parsing, consider using an HTML parsing library like `goquery` or `colly`.\n\n- Regular expressions are sufficient for simple cases but might not be reliable for complex HTML structures.\n"
