        "content": "Let's see. There's a class of 30 students, out of which 12 are boys and the rest are girls. So, the number of girls would be 30 minus 12, which is 18 girls.\n\nNow, 8 boys wear glasses and 10 girls wear glasses. To find the probability that a randomly selected student wears glasses, I need to find the total number of students who wear glasses and divide that by the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of students who wear glasses. That would be the number of boys who wear glasses plus the number of girls who wear glasses. So, 8 boys + 10 girls = 18 students wear glasses.\n\nNext, the total number of students is 30.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student wears glasses is the number of students who wear glasses divided by the total number of students. That is 18 divided by 30.\n\nTo simplify that fraction, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 6. 18 divided by 6 is 3, and 30 divided by 6 is 5. So, the simplified fraction is 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this probability as a decimal. 3 divided by 5 is 0.6.\n\nOr, as a percentage, 0.6 is equal to 60%.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I added 8 boys and 10 girls who wear glasses to get 18, and total students are 30. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the probability separately for boys and girls and then combine them.\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected student is a boy is 12/30, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nThe probability that a boy wears glasses is 8 out of 12, which is 8/12 = 2/3.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student is a boy who wears glasses is (2/5) * (2/3) = 4/15.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a randomly selected student is a girl is 18/30, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nThe probability that a girl wears glasses is 10 out of 18, which is 10/18 = 5/9.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student is a girl who wears glasses is (3/5) * (5/9) = 15/45, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that a randomly selected student wears glasses, I add the two probabilities: 4/15 (for boys) + 1/3 (for girls).\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. 1/3 is equal to 5/15, so 4/15 + 5/15 = 9/15.\n\nSimplifying 9/15 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3, I get 3/5.\n\nSo, again, I get the same answer: 3/5.\n\nThis matches my initial calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for total probability:\n\nP(glasses) = P(glasses|boy) * P(boy) + P(glasses|girl) * P(girl)\n\nWhich is what I just did.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the numbers, we can directly use the total number of students who wear glasses divided by total students, which is again 18/30 = 3/5.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the answer remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected student wears glasses is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
