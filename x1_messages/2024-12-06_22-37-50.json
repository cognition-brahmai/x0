It's kind of counterintuitive at first glance because you'd think you need a lot more people to have such a high chance of two people sharing a birthday. But apparently, with just 57 people, the probability is already over 99%. Let me see if I can recall how that number is calculated.\n\nSo, the way to approach this is to calculate the probability that no one shares a birthday and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least two people do share a birthday.\n\nAssuming there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years), for the first person, there are 365 possible birthdays. For the second person, to not share a birthday, there are 364 possible days, and so on, down to the nth person, who would have (365 - n + 1) possible days.\n\nSo the probability that no one shares a birthday is:\n\nP(no shared birthday) = 365/365 * 364/365 * 363/365 * ... * (365 - n + 1)/365\n\nAnd the probability that at least two people share a birthday is:\n\nP(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - P(no shared birthday)\n\nWe want this probability to be at least 99%, so:\n\n1 - P(no shared birthday) >= 0.99\n\nWhich means:\n\nP(no shared birthday) <= 0.01\n\nSo we need to find the smallest n such that:\n\n365/365 * 364/365 * 363/365 * ... * (365 - n + 1)/365 <= 0.01\n\nThis is a bit tricky to calculate manually because it involves a descending product. Usually, people use approximations or look up tables for this.\n\nI recall that the number is around 57 people for a 99% chance. Let me verify that.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula to calculate the minimum number of people required for a given probability. The formula is:\n\nn >= ln(1 - p) / ln(365/364)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the exact formula to find the probability of no shared birthdays is:\n\nP(no shared birthday) = 365! / (365^n * (365 - n)!)\n\nBut factorials of large numbers are hard to compute directly. So, often, people use approximations or iterative calculations.\n\nGiven that, it's easier to use computational tools or pre-existing tables to find the exact number.\n\nHowever, for the sake of understanding, let's consider that with 57 people, the probability of at least one shared birthday is indeed above 99%.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some key numbers:\n\n- With 23 people, the probability is about 50%.\n\n- With 50 people, it's about 97%.\n\n- With 57 people, it's roughly 99%.\n\nSo, to answer your question, you need at least 57 people in the room for there to be a 99% chance that at least two people share the same birthday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{57} \\]"
