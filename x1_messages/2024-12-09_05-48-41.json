New questions today about President Trump's unexpected and unscheduled medical visit. A source tell CNN the President's unannounced visit to Walter Reed Medical Center Saturday afternoon did not follow protocol for routine visit. The White House continues to downplay the surprised visit saying the President underwent quick exam and labs as part of an annual physical. CNN's chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta and CNN historian Tim Naftali are standing by for us. First let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond who is at the White House. What are you hearing, Jeremy, about this routine medical exam? JEREMEY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That's right, Fredricka. A person familiar with the matter is telling me this morning that President Trump's visit yesterday to Walter Reed Military Medical center did not follow the typical protocol for a routine medical visit by the President of the United States. Typically, I'm told there would be a general notice sent out to the medical staff at Walter Reed informing them of a VIP visit, letting them know there would be certain closures for a VIP like the President of the United States. That did not happen in this case, according to my source. That doesn't mean necessarily that there were no doctors who were notified ahead of time, but clearly what the source is telling me is it was not a routine medical visit based on the protocol that was followed. So that remains to be seen. The White House is responding in a statement to me this morning saying this is from the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham. She says, we are not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President. But as my statement said, he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical. I have given plenty of On the Record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop. But Fredricka, this latest reporting that I am hearing about this morning kind of fills out the picture that we have already learned in the last 24 hours which was that his visit was unscheduled. It was not announced ahead of time. Reporters traveling with the President were under direction not to report that the President was moving until he actually arrived at Walter Reed. They didn't know that they were actually headed there. The President himself has also tweeted. He said that he did undergo the first routine for part of his physical exam and he'll complete it next year. I also asked the White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham about why the President was not able to do the full typically four-hour physical exam during this weekend, because she cited this free weekend that the President had. She did not respond to that question -- Fred. WHITFIELD: All right. Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much. We are going to talk further about all this. Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Tim Naftali both with me. We are talking about this in this context because customarily the President's medical exam is one that has to be publicized to a certain extent because we are talking about the commander in chief, the President of the United States. But ordinarily there is some notice to the public, Sanjay Gupta. So why in this case does it seem unusual for an unscheduled yet routine exam, and now we're hearing it's only the first part of what would be a full four-hour exam? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. No, I mean, it is unusual. It's unusual in that the public didn't know. Which, by the way, this President in the White House has alerted in the past, so it wasn't like in the past they hadn't told. This was different from even the way that this White House has talked about his physical exams in the past. The fact that the hospital didn't know, that's a big deal. WHITFIELD: Why is that a big deal? What has to be put in place? GUPTA: There is a lot of prep when the President of the United States is going to Walter reed or attend any of the military hospitals. As Jeremy mentioned, they close off certain parts. There is a staff-wide notice people understand that the President is going to be there. So there are procedural protocols. There is also -- if there are certain exams that are going to be done at the hospital that can't be done at the White House, such as tests on the heart or the scans, things like that, you know, those things have to be ready. He is probably not going to sit around and wait, right, for those things to happen. I should point out as well, I spend a lot of time in the White House Medical office within the White House itself. They have pretty good capabilities there. They certainly can do, you know, a physical exam. They can take certain laboratory tests and things like that. If he was getting basic labs and a physical, why was that at Walter Reed? I guess -- Stephanie Grisham wasn't very clear. She said there were no problems. There were no symptoms, nothing that sort of prompted this visit. But I think as a medical person, if somebody makes a surprise unannounced visit to a hospital, that is the first question you would ask. [14:0:26] WHITFIELD: It usually means it is provoked by something new. GUPTA: Right, something happened. WHITFIELD: Something about his condition has changed, is the presumption. GUPTA: May not be serious, official serious, , hey, let's get this checked out, but as a routine matter to have not let the hospital know and anyone know again seems unusual. WHITFIELD: So back in the day before a President's routine exam or medical exam, it would be at Walter Reed or Bethesda Naval. Now they have been combined. So when we talk about Walter Reed, we are talking about Bethesda Naval. That's where the President has gone at this time. Talk to me what usually constitutes a routine exam? What is in there? What is the discovery that a doctor is looking for? GUPTA: We know some of what President Trump has done in the past in terms of his exam. There are some basic things that are done with physical exams, you know, blood pressure, heart rate, doing a general physical assessment, taking certain laboratory values. We know certain things about the President from the past in terms of his own, what we learned from his previous physical exams, his height, his weight, those are things taken obviously and compared to years past. Also we know he has a common form of heart disease. He has calcium in the blood vessels that lead to his heart, how are those doing? Maybe they want to follow up on that. He takes a cholesterol lowering medication, maybe they want to test for that, see if that dosage needs to be adjusted. There are some things that go into it and there are a certain number of tests, like a stress treadmill test. When you get on a treadmill and you see how your heart react to the stress of running, of activity in this case. So you know, again, some of those things cant be done at the White House. A lot of them can be done. So what was it that needed to be done at the hospital that can't be done at the White House? WHITFIELD: Yes. Because of those you mentioned in a routine exam, heart changes might be more of an urgent matter of those routine things. GUPTA: I think so, yes. That is always top of the list, especially for anybody who is in their 70s. WHITFIELD: All right. Let's bring Tim into this. Because Tim, customarily the President gets a routine exam. Nothing alarming about that. But talk to us about some of the examinations that Presidents in the past have received. Almost all of them would be at Bethesda Naval or now Walter Reed? TIMOTHY NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Yes. And when Presidents have an unscheduled trip to the doctor, it is natural, regardless of the presidency, for the public to be worried. I remember, I'm sure Sanjay does, too, when President George W. Bush apparently choked on a pretzel. I think it was at camp David. And there was a great deal of speculation about whether that was indeed what had happened and the cause and what the consequences were. So I think it's absolutely normal and natural given that we are talking about the leader of the free world, or at least we used to be talking in those terms, that when something unscheduled happens, one begins to think about the history of a little bit of deception from White Houses, you know, Republican and Democratic. One of the things White Houses don't like to do is to create anxiety and concern about the President. They don't want to send the wrong signal to the markets, for example, to foreign adversaries. A weakness in the presidency is something that no White House, regardless of party, wants to do. So if there is an uncertainty about the condition of the President, the White House is the last place where they are going to share that with the public. And that has historically been the case. During Ronald Reagan's period in office, the White House did try to catch up with the truth about the President's condition, but it took a while. After he was unfortunately shot, the White House didn't really share the extent to which he not only nearly died but how deeply weakened he had been by the incident. Fortunately for all of us, he came roaring back. But the White House wasn't straightforward about it. We have had instances in the case of John f. Kennedy where the White House doesn't share anything about the basic underlying physical weaknesses of the President. So there is a history of presidencies not being honest. And given that this President has a strained relationship with the truth, let us say, it makes us even more concerned that perhaps we are not getting the full story from the White House. WHITFIELD: So, then, Tim, underscore the importance of the kind of transparency that comes with the President is getting an exam, and here are the conditions and the reasons why. And you can't help but overlook the importance of this timing of this weekend and the President, you know, getting this exam unannounced in the midst of an impeachment inquiry. There may be no correlation, but one can't ignore the fact that it is happening unannounced but with some level of urgency that it has to happen this weekend. NAFTALI: Fred, I don't know. I just hope the President gets better. And one of the things we're discussing a lot when we talk about impeachment these days is the poisonous character of conspiracy theories. And we are not discussing conspiracy theories now, but let's just say this is a time when it is especially important for the White House to be transparent, given everything else that's going on. WHITFIELD: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, what are your thoughts on the transparency, the amount of information that is owed to the public? GUPTA: Tim makes very good points. I mean, there is not without precedent. There is a lack of a willingness, I think, on candidates, even, to not share medical information. We asked for medical records. I have been doing this for 20 years. We typically get a one-page summary. It's not full transparency. But this seems a little different, still, because he goes to the hospital, he leaves the hospital. Reagan got shot. They knew eventually that eventually was going to would find out. With George Bush they said he actually passed out from choking on a pretzel. He actually had an abrasion on his face that people would be asking about. Here there would maybe be nothing specific that would be an indicator at all, so we may never know. We are not required to know. There is no mandate that we need to be told this, the press or the people. So who knows where this goes from here. What we have heard is they will release the test results at some point when the entire physical is completed. They could have done the entire physical this weekend, as Jeremy mentioned. But when it is entirely completed we will see what they show at that time. WHITFIELD: All right. All of you have given us great information, but still a lot of big question remain. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Tim Naftali and Jeremy Diamond at the top, thanks to all of you. I appreciate it. All right, still ahead. A closer look at key witnesses expected to testify this week in the impeachment inquiry. And later, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR: However, today I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong, and I'm sorry.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
