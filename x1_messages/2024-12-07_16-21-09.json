Calculate the total profit for each product by multiplying the profit per unit by the number of units sold.\n3. Sum the total profits from both products to get the overall profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the profit per unit for Product A. The profit margin for Product A is 30%, and it is sold at $15 each. The profit per unit can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit per unit of Product A} = \\text{Selling price} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit margin}}{100} \\right) = 15 \\times \\left( \\frac{30}{100} \\right) = 15 \\times 0.30 = 4.5 \\]\n\nSo, the profit per unit of Product A is $4.5.\n\nNext, we calculate the total profit from Product A by multiplying the profit per unit by the number of units sold:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total profit from Product A} = \\text{Profit per unit} \\times \\text{Number of units} = 4.5 \\times 100 = 450 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the profit per unit for Product B. The profit margin for Product B is 50%, and it is sold at $10 each. The profit per unit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit per unit of Product B} = 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{50}{100} \\right) = 10 \\times 0.50 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the profit per unit of Product B is $5.\n\nThen, we calculate the total profit from Product B by multiplying the profit per unit by the number of units sold:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total profit from Product B} = 5 \\times 200 = 1000 \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total profit generated from both products, we add the total profits from Product A and Product B:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total profit} = \\text{Total profit from Product A} + \\text{Total profit from Product B} = 450 + 1000 = 1450 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total profit generated from these sales is $1450.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1450} \\]"
