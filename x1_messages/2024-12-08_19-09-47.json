        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python application that connects to a SQLite database, lets users perform CRUD operations, and displays the results in a table using PrettyTable. I need to make sure I cover all the parts: connecting to the database, creating a table, inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data, and then displaying it nicely.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up the environment. I'll need Python installed, and I'll need to install the SQLite library and PrettyTable. Luckily, SQLite comes pre-installed with Python, so I don't need to worry about that. But I do need to install PrettyTable. I can do that using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install prettytable\n```\n\nOkay, with that out of the way, I can start planning the structure of the application. I think it would be good to have a menu-based system where the user can choose what operation they want to perform: Create, Read, Update, Delete, or Exit.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the steps:\n\n1. Connect to the SQLite database.\n\n2. Create a table if it doesn't exist.\n\n3. Present a menu to the user with options: Create, Read, Update, Delete, Exit.\n\n4. Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding operation.\n\n- For Create: Ask the user for data to insert into the table.\n\n- For Read: Retrieve and display all records from the table.\n\n- For Update: Ask for the record to update and the new data.\n\n- For Delete: Ask for the record to delete.\n\n5. Use PrettyTable to format and display the results nicely.\n\n6. Handle any errors that might occur during these operations.\n\nI need to decide on the table structure. For simplicity, let's create a table to store books, with columns for ID, Title, Author, and Price.\n\nSo, the table creation SQL might look like this:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    title TEXT NOT NULL,\n    author TEXT NOT NULL,\n    price REAL NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\nNow, for each CRUD operation:\n\n- **Create (Insert)**: Ask the user for the title, author, and price, then insert a new row into the table.\n\n- **Read (Select)**: Retrieve all rows from the table and display them in a table format using PrettyTable.\n\n- **Update**: Ask the user for the book ID to update, then ask for the new title, author, and price.\n\n- **Delete**: Ask the user for the book ID to delete, then remove that row from the table.\n\nI should also think about how to handle user inputs to prevent SQL injection. Using parameterized queries is a good practice here.\n\nLet me think about the menu. It should be simple and clear. Something like:\n\n```\n\nCRUD Operations Menu:\n\n1. Create (Insert a new book)\n\n2. Read (View all books)\n\n3. Update (Update a book's details)\n\n4. Delete (Delete a book)\n\n5. Exit\n\nEnter your choice (1-5):\n\n```\n\nAfter the user makes a choice, the application should perform the corresponding operation and then loop back to the menu unless the user chooses to exit.\n\nI need to make sure that the application handles invalid inputs gracefully, like if the user enters a non-integer or an invalid choice.\n\nAlso, for the display part, PrettyTable should make it easy to show the data in a tabular format. I'll need to fetch all rows from the table and pass them to PrettyTable to render.\n\nLet me consider writing a function for each operation to keep the code organized.\n\n- `create_book()`: Handles inserting a new book.\n\n- `read_books()`: Handles retrieving and displaying all books.\n\n- `update_book()`: Handles updating a book's details.\n\n- `delete_book()`: Handles deleting a book.\n\nAnd, of course, the main function to show the menu and handle user choices.\n\nI should also think about closing the database connection properly, maybe using a context manager to handle that.\n\nWait, in Python, when using the sqlite3 module, it's good to use context managers to handle connecting and closing the database. That way, I don't have to worry about manually closing the connection.\n\nLet me recall how to use sqlite3 in Python. First, import the module:\n\n```python\n\nimport sqlite3\n\nfrom sqlite3 import Error\n\n```\n\nThen, to connect to a database:\n\n```python\n\ndef create_connection(db_file):\n\n    conn = None;\n\n    try:\n\n        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)\n\n        print(\"Connection established\")\n\n    except Error as e:\n\n        print(e)\n\n    return conn\n\n```\n\nAnd to create a table:\n\n```python\n\ndef create_table(conn, create_table_sql):\n\n    try:\n\n        c = conn.cursor()\n\n        c.execute(create_table_sql)\n\n    except Error as e:\n\n        print(e)\n\n```\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for inserting a book:\n\n```python\n\ndef create_book(conn, book):\n\n    sql = '''INSERT INTO books(title,author,price)\n\n              VALUES(?,?,?)'''\n\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n\n    cur.execute(sql, book)\n\n    conn.commit()\n\n    return cur.lastrowid\n\n```\n\nSimilarly, for updating:\n\n```python\n\ndef update_book(conn, book):\n\n    sql = ''' UPDATE books\n\n              SET title = ?,\n\n                  author = ?,\n\n                  price = ?\n\n              WHERE id = ?'''\n\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n\n    cur.execute(sql, book)\n\n    conn.commit()\n\n```\n\nFor deleting:\n\n```python\n\ndef delete_book(conn, id):\n\n    sql = 'DELETE FROM books WHERE id=?'\n\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n\n    cur.execute(sql, (id,))\n\n    conn.commit()\n\n```\n\nAnd for selecting all books:\n\n```python\n\ndef select_all_books(conn):\n\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n\n    cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM books\")\n\n    rows = cur.fetchall()\n\n    return rows\n\n```\n\nNow, to display these rows using PrettyTable:\n\nFirst, import PrettyTable:\n\n```python\n\nfrom prettytable import PrettyTable\n\n```\n\nThen, create a function to display the books:\n\n```python\n\ndef display_books(rows):\n\n    table = PrettyTable()\n\n    table.field_names = [\"ID\", \"Title\", \"Author\", \"Price\"]\n\n    for row in rows:\n\n        table.add_row(row)\n\n    print(table)\n\n```\n\nThat should nicely format the output.\n\nNow, for the main menu, I can use a loop that keeps displaying the menu until the user chooses to exit.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```python\n\ndef main():\n\n    database = \"pythonsqlite.db\"\n\n    # create a database connection\n\n    conn = create_connection(database)\n\n    if conn is not None:\n\n        # create books table\n\n        create_table(conn, sql_create_books_table)\n\n        while True:\n\n            print(\"\\nCRUD Operations Menu:\n\n1. Create (Insert a new book)\n\n2. Read (View all books)\n\n3. Update (Update a book's details)\n\n4. Delete (Delete a book)\n\n5. Exit\")\n\n            choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1-5): \")\n\n            if choice == '1':\n\n                title = input(\"Enter book title: \")\n\n                author = input(\"Enter book author: \")\n\n                price = float(input(\"Enter book price: \"))\n\n                book = (title, author, price)\n\n                create_book(conn, book)\n\n                print(\"Book added successfully.\")\n\n            elif choice == '2':\n\n                rows = select_all_books(conn)\n\n                display_books(rows)\n\n            elif choice == '3':\n\n                id = int(input(\"Enter the book ID to update: \"))\n\n                title = input(\"Enter new book title: \")\n\n                author = input(\"Enter new book author: \")\n\n                price = float(input(\"Enter new book price: \"))\n\n                book = (title, author, price, id)\n\n                update_book(conn, book)\n\n                print(\"Book updated successfully.\")\n\n            elif choice == '4':\n\n                id = int(input(\"Enter the book ID to delete: \"))\n\n                delete_book(conn, id)\n\n                print(\"Book deleted successfully.\")\n\n            elif choice == '5':\n\n                break\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.\")\n\n        conn.close()\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"Error! Cannot create the database connection.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n    main()\n\n```\n\nI need to define `sql_create_books_table` somewhere:\n\n```python\n\nsql_create_books_table = \"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (\n\n                                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n\n                                title TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n                                author TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n                                price REAL NOT NULL\n\n                            );\"\"\"\n\n```\n\nAlso, I should add some error handling for cases where the user enters invalid data, like non-numeric prices or IDs.\n\nMaybe I can wrap the input sections in try-except blocks to handle such errors.\n\nFor example, when asking for a price:\n\n```python\n\ntry:\n\n    price = float(input(\"Enter book price: \"))\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\n    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number for price.\")\n\n    return\n\n```\n\nSimilarly for IDs.\n\nAlright, I think this covers the basic requirements. Let me summarize:\n\n- Connected to a SQLite database.\n\n- Created a books table if it doesn't exist.\n\n- Provided a menu for CRUD operations.\n\n- Implemented functions to create, read, update, and delete books.\n\n- Used PrettyTable to display the books in a table format.\n\n- Used a loop to keep the menu persistent until the user chooses to exit.\n\nI might want to add some more features later, like searching for a specific book or sorting the list, but for now, this should suffice.\n\nI should also think about data validation. For example, ensuring that the title and author are not empty, and that the price is a positive number.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider handling cases where the user tries to update or delete a book that doesn't exist.\n\nBut for the scope of this task, I think this is adequate.\n\nLet me try to write the complete code now, incorporating all these elements.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python application that connects to a SQLite database, allows users to perform CRUD operations on a table, and displays the results in a tabular format using the PrettyTable library, follow these steps:\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nfrom sqlite3 import Error\nfrom prettytable import PrettyTable\n\n# SQL statement to create the books table\nsql_create_books_table = \"\"\"\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    title TEXT NOT NULL,\n    author TEXT NOT NULL,\n    price REAL NOT NULL\n);\n\"\"\"\n\ndef create_connection(db_file):\n    conn = None\n    try:\n        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)\n        print(\"Connection established\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n    return conn\n\ndef create_table(conn, create_table_sql):\n    try:\n        c = conn.cursor()\n        c.execute(create_table_sql)\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n\ndef create_book(conn, book):\n    sql = '''INSERT INTO books(title,author,price)\n              VALUES(?,?,?)'''\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute(sql, book)\n    conn.commit()\n    return cur.lastrowid\n\ndef update_book(conn, book):\n    sql = ''' UPDATE books\n              SET title = ?,\n                  author = ?,\n                  price = ?\n              WHERE id = ?'''\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute(sql, book)\n    conn.commit()\n\ndef delete_book(conn, id):\n    sql = 'DELETE FROM books WHERE id=?'\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute(sql, (id,))\n    conn.commit()\n\ndef select_all_books(conn):\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM books\")\n    rows = cur.fetchall()\n    return rows\n\ndef display_books(rows):\n    table = PrettyTable()\n    table.field_names = [\"ID\", \"Title\", \"Author\", \"Price\"]\n    for row in rows:\n        table.add_row(row)\n    print(table)\n\ndef main():\n    database = \"pythonsqlite.db\"\n    \n    # Create a database connection\n    conn = create_connection(database)\n    if conn is not None:\n        # Create books table\n        create_table(conn, sql_create_books_table)\n        \n        while True:\n            print(\"\\nCRUD Operations Menu:\")\n            print(\"1.
