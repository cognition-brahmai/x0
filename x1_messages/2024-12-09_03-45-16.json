        "content": "Yes, microwave ovens are designed to target the resonance frequency of water molecules for efficient heating. The microwave frequency used in these appliances is specifically chosen because it corresponds to the natural vibration frequency of water molecules, which are abundant in most foods. This resonance causes the water molecules to rotate and generate heat through friction, effectively cooking or heating the food. This targeted approach ensures that the energy is primarily absorbed by the water molecules, making the heating process efficient and rapid."

]an investment with compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for, in years.\n\nLet's plug in the values from the problem:\n\n- \\( P = 5000 \\) dollars\n\n- \\( r = 3\\% = 0.03 \\) (as a decimal)\n\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (since interest is compounded quarterly)\n\n- \\( t = 2 \\) years\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.03}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 2} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.03}{4} = 0.0075 \\]\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.0075\\right)^{8} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1.0075\\right)^{8} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\( (1.0075)^8 \\). Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 1.0075^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.0075 \\times 1.0075 = 1.01505625 \\]\n\nThen, \\( 1.01505625^2 = 1.01505625 \\times 1.01505625 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.01505625 \\times 1.01505625 = 1.030405947 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\( 1.030405947^2 \\) to get \\( 1.0075^8 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.030405947 \\times 1.030405947 = 1.061742632 \\]\n\nSo, \\( (1.0075)^8 \\approx 1.061742632 \\)\n\nNow, multiply this by the principal amount:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.061742632 = 5308.71316 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, we get:\n\n\\[ A \\approx 5308.71 \\]\n\nTherefore, after 2 years, the person will have approximately $5,308.71 in their savings account.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5308.71} \\]"
