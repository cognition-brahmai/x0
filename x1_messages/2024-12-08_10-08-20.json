        "content": "So there are five people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think about one person. If there are five people, and each shakes hands with every other person, then for each person, they shake hands with four others, right? Because there are five people in total, and you don't shake hands with yourself.\n\nSo, if each of the five people shakes hands with four others, that would suggest 5 times 4, which is 20 handshakes. But wait, that seems too high. I think I'm double-counting here.\n\nLet me think differently. If person A shakes hands with person B, that's one handshake. But in my previous calculation, I counted that handshake once when person A shakes hands with person B, and again when person B shakes hands with person A. So, I'm counting each handshake twice.\n\nTherefore, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, I need to divide my previous total by 2. So, 20 divided by 2 is 10.\n\nIs that correct? Let me check another way.\n\nMaybe I can list them out. Let's label the people as A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n- A shakes hands with B, C, D, E (that's four handshakes)\n\n- B shakes hands with C, D, E (B already shook hands with A, so we don't count that again) (that's three handshakes)\n\n- C shakes hands with D, E (two handshakes)\n\n- D shakes hands with E (one handshake)\n\n- E doesn't shake hands with anyone new at this point.\n\nSo, total handshakes: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, there are 10 handshakes in total.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for this. I recall something about combinations. If you have n people, and each shakes hands with every other person exactly once, the number of handshakes is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n, which is the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n = 5, so C(5, 2) = 5*4/2 = 10.\n\nAgain, that confirms my earlier answer.\n\nLet me try another approach to be sure. What if there are fewer people?\n\nSuppose there are 2 people: A and B. They shake hands once. According to the formula, C(2, 2) = 2*1/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nWith 3 people: A, B, C. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, B-C. Total 3 handshakes. Using the formula: C(3, 2) = 3*2/2 = 3. Correct.\n\nWith 4 people: A, B, C, D. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. Total 6 handshakes. Formula: C(4, 2) = 4*3/2 = 6. Correct.\n\nSo, for 5 people: C(5, 2) = 5*4/2 = 10. Seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the first person shakes hands with 4 others, the second with 3 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), the third with 2, the fourth with 1, and the fifth doesn't have any new handshakes. So, 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nThis matches all the methods I've used, so I'm confident that the answer is 10 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
