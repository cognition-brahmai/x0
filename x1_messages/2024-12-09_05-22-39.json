        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 green balls, and 2 blue balls. So, total balls in the bag are 5 + 3 + 2, which is 10 balls. Now, I need to draw 3 balls at random without replacement, and I want to find the probability that exactly one of those balls is red.\n\nOkay, so without replacement means that once I draw a ball, it stays out and doesn't go back into the bag. That affects the probabilities for the next draws because the total number of balls decreases each time I draw.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"exactly one ball is red\" means. It means that out of the 3 balls I draw, one is red and the other two are not red. The other two can be either green or blue, but not red.\n\nSo, to find this probability, I can use the concept of combinations because the order in which I draw the balls doesn't matter here. It's about the combination of balls I end up with.\n\nLet me recall the formula for combinations. The number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to order is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 10. That would be C(10, 3).\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 10.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw exactly one red ball and two non-red balls.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 5 non-red balls (since total is 10 and red are 5, but wait, no: 5 red, 3 green, 2 blue, so non-red are 3 + 2 = 5, yes).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose one red ball from five is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two non-red balls from five is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(5, 1) * C(5, 2) = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 50 / 120 = 5/12.\n\nWait, but I should check if this is the lowest term. 50 and 120 can both be divided by 10.\n\n50 \u00f7 10 = 5\n\n120 \u00f7 10 = 12\n\nSo, yes, 5/12 is the simplified fraction.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this step by step, considering the draws one at a time.\n\nFirst draw: Probability of drawing a red ball is 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nThen, without replacement, there are 9 balls left.\n\nIf the first ball was red, then for the second draw, probability of not drawing a red ball is 5/9 (since there are 5 non-red balls left).\n\nThen, for the third draw, probability of not drawing a red ball again is 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence (red, non-red, non-red) is (1/2) * (5/9) * (1/2) = (1/2)*(5/9)*(1/2) = 5/36.\n\nBut, the red ball could be drawn first, second, or third. So, I need to consider all possible positions for the red ball.\n\nLet me calculate for each position:\n\n1. Red first: As above, probability is 5/36.\n\n2. Red second:\n\nProbability: First draw non-red: 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nSecond draw red: 5/9.\n\nThird draw non-red: 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nSo, probability is (1/2)*(5/9)*(1/2) = 5/36.\n\n3. Red third:\n\nFirst draw non-red: 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nSecond draw non-red: 4/9.\n\nThird draw red: 5/8.\n\nProbability: (1/2)*(4/9)*(5/8) = (1/2)*(4/9)*(5/8) = (1*4*5)/(2*9*8) = 20/144 = 5/36.\n\nSo, each scenario has a probability of 5/36.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events, I can add them up.\n\nTotal probability = 5/36 + 5/36 + 5/36 = 15/36 = 5/12.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier using combinations.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly one ball is red is 5/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}} \\]"
