        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are two types of candies: type A costs $3 per pound and type B costs $4 per pound. I bought a total of 10 pounds of candy, and the total cost was $34. I need to find out how many pounds of each type I bought.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's say:\n\n- Let x be the number of pounds of type A candy.\n\n- Let y be the number of pounds of type B candy.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that:\n\n1. The total weight of the candies is 10 pounds, so x + y = 10.\n\n2. The total cost is $34, and since type A costs $3 per pound and type B costs $4 per pound, the cost equation would be 3x + 4y = 34.\n\nSo, I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. x + y = 10\n\n2. 3x + 4y = 34\n\nI need to solve for x and y.\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 10 - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n3(10 - y) + 4y = 34\n\nNow, distribute the 3:\n\n30 - 3y + 4y = 34\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n30 + y = 34\n\nNow, subtract 30 from both sides:\n\ny = 4\n\nSo, I have y = 4 pounds of type B candy.\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 10 - 4 = 6\n\nTherefore, I bought 6 pounds of type A candy and 4 pounds of type B candy.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf I have 6 pounds of type A at $3 per pound, that's 6 * 3 = $18.\n\n4 pounds of type B at $4 per pound is 4 * 4 = $16.\n\nTotal cost is $18 + $16 = $34, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, 6 + 4 = 10 pounds, which matches the total weight.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to solve this is by graphing, but since this is a simple system, substitution works fine.\n\nI could also use elimination method. For example, multiply the first equation by 3:\n\n3x + 3y = 30\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(3x + 4y) - (3x + 3y) = 34 - 30\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ny = 4\n\nThen, substitute back to find x = 6.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ pounds of type A and } 4 \\text{ pounds of type B}} \\]"
