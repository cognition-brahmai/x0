        "content": "Let's see. So, in this survey, 40% of people prefer tea over coffee, and there were 200 participants in total. I need to find out how many people prefer coffee.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the 40% represents. It means that 40% of the 200 participants prefer tea. So, to find out how many people that is, I can calculate 40% of 200.\n\nTo calculate 40% of 200, I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of people who prefer tea = (percentage / 100) * total participants\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of people who prefer tea = (40 / 100) * 200 = 0.4 * 200 = 80\n\nSo, 80 people prefer tea.\n\nNow, since there are 200 participants in total, and 80 prefer tea, the remaining participants must prefer coffee.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who prefer coffee = total participants - number of people who prefer tea\n\nNumber of people who prefer coffee = 200 - 80 = 120\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider if there are people who don't prefer either or prefer both. But the question says \"prefer tea over coffee,\" which suggests that people are choosing between tea and coffee, so probably, it's just tea or coffee.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are people who don't prefer either or prefer both. However, the question doesn't mention any such possibilities, so I'll assume that everyone prefers either tea or coffee.\n\nSo, in that case, if 40% prefer tea, then the remaining 60% must prefer coffee.\n\nLet me check that: 100% - 40% = 60%\n\nSo, alternatively, I can calculate 60% of 200 to find the number of people who prefer coffee.\n\nNumber of people who prefer coffee = (60 / 100) * 200 = 0.6 * 200 = 120\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, 120 people prefer coffee.\n\nWait, but is there any chance that some people might not prefer either or prefer both? The question says \"prefer tea over coffee,\" which might imply that they are choosing one over the other, suggesting that they don't prefer both or neither.\n\nGiven that, it's safe to assume that the preferences are mutually exclusive: one prefers either tea or coffee, not both.\n\nHence, the calculation stands: 120 people prefer coffee.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a possibility of people preferring both or neither, the problem would probably have provided that information.\n\nSince it doesn't, I'll go with the assumption that preferences are exclusive.\n\nSo, the answer is 120 people prefer coffee.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
