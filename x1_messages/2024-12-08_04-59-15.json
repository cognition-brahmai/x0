        "content": "So I've got this problem here about optimizing container loading for a shipping company. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. Each container can hold up to 20 tons, but the law limits it to 18 tons per container. The company has 100 containers available. I need to calculate the total weight capacity when loaded to the legal limit and then figure out how many additional containers are needed to ship 2,000 tons of cargo.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: calculating the total weight capacity when loaded to the legal limit.\n\nStep 1: Determine the weight capacity per container under the legal limit.\n\nEach container can be loaded up to 18 tons legally.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total capacity for 100 containers.\n\nTotal capacity = number of containers \u00d7 legal limit per container\n\nTotal capacity = 100 containers \u00d7 18 tons/container\n\nTotal capacity = 1,800 tons\n\nSo, with 100 containers loaded to the legal limit, the company can ship 1,800 tons of cargo.\n\nNow, the second part is to determine how many additional containers are needed to ship a total of 2,000 tons of cargo.\n\nStep 3: Determine the shortfall in cargo capacity.\n\nShortfall = total cargo to be shipped - current total capacity\n\nShortfall = 2,000 tons - 1,800 tons\n\nShortfall = 200 tons\n\nSo, the company needs to ship an additional 200 tons.\n\nStep 4: Calculate how many additional containers are needed to cover the shortfall.\n\nEach additional container can carry up to 18 tons (legal limit).\n\nNumber of additional containers needed = shortfall / legal limit per container\n\nNumber of additional containers needed = 200 tons / 18 tons/container\n\nNumber of additional containers needed \u2248 11.11 containers\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a container, you'll need to round up to the next whole number.\n\nTherefore, the company needs 12 additional containers to ship the extra 200 tons.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that.\n\nIf 11 containers are used:\n\n11 containers \u00d7 18 tons/container = 198 tons\n\nThat would cover 198 tons, which is still 2 tons short of the 200 tons needed.\n\nTherefore, 11 containers aren't enough.\n\nSo, 12 containers are required:\n\n12 containers \u00d7 18 tons/container = 216 tons\n\nThis covers the 200 tons needed, with a little extra capacity to spare.\n\nAlternatively, if the company is trying to minimize the number of containers used, they might look into whether those last few tons can be distributed among the existing containers without exceeding the legal limit. However, given the legal restriction, that might not be possible.\n\nAnother approach could be to see if any containers can be loaded slightly over the legal limit, but that would be illegal and could lead to fines or other legal consequences, so it's not advisable.\n\nTherefore, sticking to the legal limit, the company needs 12 additional containers to ship the extra 200 tons.\n\nBut, let's consider if there's a more efficient way.\n\nWhat if the company uses some containers at less than full capacity to minimize the number of additional containers?\n\nFor example, if they use 11 containers at 18 tons each, that's 198 tons, which is 2 tons short.\n\nCould they distribute these 2 tons among the existing 100 containers without exceeding the legal limit?\n\nEach container is already at 18 tons, so unless they can find some containers that are not fully loaded, they can't add more weight.\n\nWait, the problem states that there are 100 containers available, but it doesn't specify if they are all already loaded or not.\n\nAssuming that the 100 containers are available and not yet loaded, then they can load them up to the legal limit.\n\nSo, with 100 containers at 18 tons each, that's 1,800 tons.\n\nTo ship 2,000 tons, they need an additional 200 tons.\n\nThus, they need additional containers to carry this extra 200 tons.\n\nGiven that each additional container can carry up to 18 tons, they would need at least 12 containers, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if they could load some containers a bit heavier, but that's against the law, so it's not an option.\n\nAnother consideration could be to negotiate with the shipping company to allow overweight containers, but that would likely require special permits and might not be feasible.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward solution is to use 12 additional containers to ship the extra 200 tons.\n\nIn total, the company would need 100 + 12 = 112 containers to ship 2,000 tons of cargo, adhering to the legal weight limits.\n\nBut, let's verify the initial calculation to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nTotal cargo to be shipped: 2,000 tons\n\nEach container can carry up to 18 tons legally.\n\nTotal containers needed = total cargo / legal limit per container\n\nTotal containers needed = 2,000 tons / 18 tons/container\n\nTotal containers needed \u2248 111.11 containers\n\nSince partial containers aren't possible, round up to 112 containers.\n\nThis matches the earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the company needs 12 additional containers beyond the initial 100 to ship 2,000 tons of cargo while adhering to the legal weight limits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
