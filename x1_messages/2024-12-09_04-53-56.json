        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a group of people is standing in a circle, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. The total number of handshakes is 66, and I need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what's going on. If there are n people in the group, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once, how do I calculate the total number of handshakes?\n\nI remember that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items from n items is given by the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!), which simplifies to n*(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of handshakes should be C(n, 2) because each handshake is a unique pair of people.\n\nGiven that, I can set up the equation:\n\nn*(n - 1)/2 = 66\n\nNow, I need to solve for n.\n\nFirst, I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn*(n - 1) = 132\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation:\n\nn^2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation for n.\n\nI can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula.\n\nLet's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1.\n\nHmmm, let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of 132:\n\n1 and 132\n\n2 and 66\n\n3 and 44\n\n4 and 33\n\n6 and 22\n\n11 and 12\n\nNow, considering the signs, I need one positive and one negative such that their product is -132 and their sum is -1.\n\nLooking at 11 and 12: 11 * 12 = 132, and 11 - 12 = -1.\n\nSo, I can write the equation as:\n\n(n - 12)(n + 11) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero:\n\nn - 12 = 0 => n = 12\n\nn + 11 = 0 => n = -11\n\nBut n represents the number of people, which can't be negative, so n = 12.\n\nWait, but I should check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 12 people, the number of handshakes is C(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66, which matches the given number.\n\nSo, the answer should be 12.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other possible interpretations.\n\nIs there a possibility that the handshakes are directed, meaning that shaking hands from A to B is different from B to A? In this problem, it seems like handshakes are undirected; that is, A shaking hands with B is the same as B shaking hands with A.\n\nTherefore, using combinations is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if handshakes were directed, it would be permutations, which is P(n, 2) = n*(n-1), but that would give twice as many handshakes, which isn't the case here.\n\nAlso, the problem states that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, so no repetitions.\n\nAnother way to think about it is graph theory, where each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. The total number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is C(n, 2), which again leads me back to the same equation.\n\nSo, everything points to n = 12.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a possibility of a different solution.\n\nSuppose n = 12 is the only positive integer solution to the equation n^2 - n - 132 = 0.\n\nSince quadratic equations have at most two real solutions, and one of them is negative, n = 12 is the only valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the group consists of 12 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
