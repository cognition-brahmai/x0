        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a triangle with sides of lengths 7 cm, 10 cm, and 13 cm, and I need to find its area. Hmm, I don't know the height or any angles, just the lengths of the sides. I wonder what formula to use for this.\n\nI remember there's something called Heron's formula that can be used to find the area of a triangle when you know all three sides. Heron's formula looks like this: area = \u221a[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where a, b, and c are the side lengths, and s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the semi-perimeter, s. The semi-perimeter is half of the perimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2. Plugging in the side lengths: s = (7 + 10 + 13)/2 = 30/2 = 15 cm.\n\nNow, plug s, a, b, and c into Heron's formula: area = \u221a[15(15-7)(15-10)(15-13)] = \u221a[15*8*5*2]. Let's calculate inside the square root: 15*8=120, 120*5=600, 600*2=1200. So, area = \u221a1200.\n\n\u221a1200 seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify that. 1200 factors into 400*3, and since 400 is a perfect square, \u221a1200 = \u221a(400*3) = \u221a400 * \u221a3 = 20\u221a3. So, the area is 20\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can use the law of cosines to find one of the angles and then use the formula area = (1/2)*a*b*sin(C).\n\nLet's try that. First, use the law of cosines to find angle C opposite side c=13 cm. The law of cosines states: c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab*cos(C).\n\nPlugging in the values: 13\u00b2 = 7\u00b2 + 10\u00b2 - 2*7*10*cos(C) \u2192 169 = 49 + 100 - 140*cos(C) \u2192 169 = 149 - 140*cos(C) \u2192 20 = -140*cos(C) \u2192 cos(C) = -20/140 = -1/7.\n\nNow, find angle C by taking arccos(-1/7). I don't have a calculator right now, but I can leave it in terms of arccos for now.\n\nNext, find sin(C). Since sin\u00b2(C) + cos\u00b2(C) = 1, sin(C) = \u221a(1 - cos\u00b2(C)) = \u221a(1 - (-1/7)\u00b2) = \u221a(1 - 1/49) = \u221a(48/49) = \u221a48/7 = 4\u221a3/7.\n\nNow, plug into the area formula: area = (1/2)*a*b*sin(C) = (1/2)*7*10*(4\u221a3/7) = (1/2)*70*(4\u221a3/7) = (35)*(4\u221a3/7) = (35/7)*4\u221a3 = 5*4\u221a3 = 20\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got using Heron's formula. Good, it's consistent.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using vectors or coordinates, but that might be more complicated for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could check if the triangle is a right triangle, but let's see: does 7\u00b2 + 10\u00b2 = 13\u00b2? 49 + 100 = 149, which is not equal to 169, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nWait, but 13\u00b2 = 169, and 12\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 = 144 + 25 = 169, so maybe it's a 5-12-13 triangle, but the sides are 7, 10, and 13, which don't match. So, not a right triangle.\n\nI think Heron's formula and the law of cosines are the way to go here. Both methods confirm the area is 20\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me see if there's any other property or formula that could apply here.\n\nOh, maybe I can use the formula involving the circumradius, but that seems more complicated and less straightforward than what I've already done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can split the triangle into two right triangles and find the area that way.\n\nSuppose I draw an altitude to the side of length 13 cm, splitting it into two parts, x and 13 - x. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem on both smaller triangles, I can set up equations to solve for x and the height.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet the altitude be h, and it splits the base (side 13 cm) into x and 13 - x.\n\nThen, in one triangle: h\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 7\u00b2 \u2192 h\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 49.\n\nIn the other triangle: h\u00b2 + (13 - x)\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 \u2192 h\u00b2 + (169 - 26x + x\u00b2) = 100.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: [h\u00b2 + 169 - 26x + x\u00b2] - [h\u00b2 + x\u00b2] = 100 - 49 \u2192 169 - 26x = 51 \u2192 -26x = -118 \u2192 x = 118/26 = 59/13 cm.\n\nNow, plug x back into the first equation to find h: h\u00b2 + (59/13)\u00b2 = 49 \u2192 h\u00b2 + 3481/169 = 49 \u2192 h\u00b2 = 49 - 3481/169 = (49*169 - 3481)/169 = (8281 - 3481)/169 = 4800/169.\n\nSo, h = \u221a(4800/169) = \u221a4800 / \u221a169 = \u221a(16*100*3)/13 = (4*10*\u221a3)/13 = 40\u221a3/13 cm.\n\nNow, area = (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*13*(40\u221a3/13) = (1/2)*40\u221a3 = 20\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems no matter which method I use, I end up with the area being 20\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that's the correct answer.\n\nJust for completeness, I'll consider if there's any other approach, like using trigonometric identities or other properties of triangles, but I don't think that's necessary since multiple methods have already confirmed the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could verify the calculation by plugging in the values again.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = 15 cm\n\nArea = \u221a[15*(15-7)*(15-10)*(15-13)] = \u221a[15*8*5*2] = \u221a1200 = 20\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the law of cosines:\n\ncos(C) = -1/7\n\nsin(C) = 4\u221a3/7\n\nArea = (1/2)*7*10*(4\u221a3/7) = 20\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nAnd using the altitude method:\n\nh = 40\u221a3/13 cm\n\nArea = (1/2)*13*(40\u221a3/13) = 20\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nAll three methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I can check if 20\u221a3 is approximately equal to what I'd expect.\n\nLet's calculate it numerically: \u221a3 is approximately 1.732, so 20*1.732 = 34.64 cm\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, if I calculate the area using Heron's formula numerically: \u221a1200 \u2248 34.64 cm\u00b2.\n\nThat seems reasonable for a triangle with base 13 cm and height around 5.3 cm (since 1/2*13*5.3 \u2248 34.64 cm\u00b2).\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated h = 40\u221a3/13 \u2248 40*1.732/13 \u2248 69.28/13 \u2248 5.33 cm.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's thorough enough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the triangle is \\boxed{20\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2}."
