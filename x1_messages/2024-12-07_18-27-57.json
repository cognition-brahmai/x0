He was an Irish pirate who operated in the late 17th century, and there are stories that he buried his treasure along the east coast of North America, possibly on Gardiner's Island off Long Island, New York. However, despite numerous searches, his treasure has never been found. It's become a part of pirate lore and continues to fascinate people to this day."
