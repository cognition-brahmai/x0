        "content": "Sound cannot travel through space because space is a vacuum, meaning it has no air or other medium for sound waves to travel through. Sound waves require a medium such as air, water, or solid material to propagate, and since there is no air in space, sound cannot travel through it. However, electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves can travel through space without a medium."
