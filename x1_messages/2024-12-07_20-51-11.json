        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train's journey, and I need to find its average speed over the entire trip. The train travels at different speeds during different parts of the journey, so I can't just take the average of the speeds. I need to think carefully about what average speed means.\n\nFirst, I recall that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I need to find the total distance the train travels and the total time it takes, then divide one by the other.\n\nLet me break down the journey into parts:\n\n1. The train travels at 60 mph for the first hour.\n\n2. Then it slows down to 40 mph for the next two hours.\n\n3. Finally, it speeds up to 80 mph for the last hour.\n\nOkay, so for each part, I can calculate the distance traveled by multiplying speed by time.\n\nFirst part: 60 mph * 1 hour = 60 miles.\n\nSecond part: 40 mph * 2 hours = 80 miles.\n\nThird part: 80 mph * 1 hour = 80 miles.\n\nNow, let's add up the distances: 60 + 80 + 80 = 220 miles.\n\nNext, let's find the total time: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 hours.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time = 220 miles / 4 hours = 55 mph.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of something called the harmonic mean for average speeds, but I think that's when the distances are the same, and speeds are different. In this case, the times are different, so I think the total distance divided by total time is the correct approach.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the weighted average of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, the first speed is 60 mph for 1 hour, the second is 40 mph for 2 hours, and the third is 80 mph for 1 hour.\n\nThe weighted average would be (60*1 + 40*2 + 80*1) / (1 + 2 + 1) = (60 + 80 + 80) / 4 = 220 / 4 = 55 mph.\n\nSame answer as before. So, that gives me more confidence.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the train had traveled equal distances at different speeds. In that case, the average speed would be the harmonic mean of the speeds. But that's not this scenario.\n\nIn this problem, the train is traveling for different times at different speeds, so the correct way is to use total distance over total time.\n\nTherefore, the average speed is 55 mph.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{55} \\]"
