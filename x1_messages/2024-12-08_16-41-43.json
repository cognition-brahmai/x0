        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour, and the total distance is 180 miles. There's a stop at Station C, which is halfway, so that's 90 miles from Town A and another 90 miles to Town B. The train stops for 15 minutes at Station C.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how long it takes to travel from Town A to Station C. Since the distance is 90 miles and the speed is 60 miles per hour, time equals distance divided by speed. So, 90 miles divided by 60 miles per hour is 1.5 hours.\n\nThen, the train stops at Station C for 15 minutes. I need to add that to the total time. But since the time is in minutes, I should convert it to hours to make it consistent with the other time measurements. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.\n\nAfter the stop, the train continues to Town B, which is another 90 miles at 60 miles per hour. So, again, 90 miles divided by 60 miles per hour is 1.5 hours.\n\nNow, I need to add up all these times: time from A to C, stop time at C, and time from C to B.\n\nThat's 1.5 hours + 0.25 hours + 1.5 hours.\n\nLet me add those up: 1.5 + 0.25 is 1.75 hours, and then 1.75 + 1.5 is 3.25 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the train to travel from Town A to Town B, including the stop at Station C, is 3.25 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this. For example, could I consider the total distance and just divide by the speed, and then add the stop time?\n\nTotal distance is 180 miles, speed is 60 miles per hour, so time is 180 / 60 = 3 hours. Then add the 15-minute stop, which is 0.25 hours, so 3 + 0.25 = 3.25 hours. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, yeah, 3.25 hours is the total time including the stop.\n\nWait a minute, but in the first method, I broke it down into two legs with a stop in between, and in the second method, I considered the total distance plus the stop. Both gave me the same result, which is a good sign.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like, does the train change speed or anything? The question says it travels at 60 miles per hour, so I assume that's constant except for the stop.\n\nAlso, the stop is exactly at Station C, which is halfway, so my calculations should be accurate.\n\nI think 3.25 hours is the correct answer.\n\nBut maybe I should express it in hours and minutes, just to make it clearer.\n\n3.25 hours is 3 hours plus 0.25 of an hour. Since 0.25 hour is 15 minutes, the total time is 3 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nSo, the train takes 3 hours and 15 minutes to travel from Town A to Town B, including the stop at Station C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.25 \\text{ hours} \\text{ or } 3 \\text{ hours and } 15 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
