Music was our language, our bond. It was the rhythm that flowed through our household, from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to sleep. My parents, both accomplished musicians, taught me the value of discipline, practice, and dedication to the craft. They showed me that music isn't just about playing notes on a sheet, it's about expressing your soul, your emotions, your experiences.\n\nBut it wasn't all serious. There was a lot of improvisation, a lot of jamming. My siblings and I would often turn the living room into our own little jazz club, experimenting with different sounds and styles. Those sessions, those moments of pure, unfiltered creativity, they shaped me as an artist. They taught me to take risks, to be spontaneous, to let the music guide me.\n\nAnd then there were the stories. Stories of their gigs, their tours, their encounters with other musicians. Those tales ignited a spark in me, a desire to create my own musical journey, to touch people's hearts with my tunes just like they did. So, in a way, my family didn't just influence my musical journey, they were the beginning of it.\nRobert: Can you describe your creative process when composing a new piece?\nMiles: Ah, the creative process, it's like a beautiful dance, my friend. It starts with a spark, a single note, a rhythm, or a feeling. I often find inspiration in the most unexpected places - a conversation, a walk in the park, even the hustle and bustle of the city. I try to capture the essence of these moments in my music.\n\nOnce I have that initial spark, I pick up my saxophone and start to play around with it. I let the music flow through me, improvising and experimenting with different melodies and rhythms. It's a conversation between me and my instrument, a dialogue that unfolds in real-time.\n\nI don't rush the process. I let the piece evolve organically, adding layers and complexities as it takes shape. Sometimes, I might hit a roadblock, but that's part of the journey. I step away, take a breather, and come back with fresh ears and a clear mind.\n\nOnce I have a solid foundation, I bring in my band. We jam together, each adding our unique flavor to the mix. The piece continues to evolve, becoming richer and more nuanced with each session.\n\nFinally, when the piece feels right, when it resonates with my soul, I know it's ready to be shared with the world. And that, my friend, is the most rewarding part of the process - seeing the audience connect with the music, feeling their energy, and knowing that I've touched their hearts in some way. It's a magical experience, one that keeps me going, keeps me creating.\nRobert: What is your most memorable performance and why?\nMiles: Ah, there's a question that stirs up a symphony of memories. I've had the privilege of playing in some of the most legendary jazz clubs and festivals around the world, but if I had to pick one, it would be my performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland.\n\nIt was a warm summer night, the air was filled with anticipation, and the crowd was buzzing with energy. I remember stepping onto that stage, the spotlight hitting me, and my saxophone gleaming under the stage lights. The moment I played the first note, it was like a magical connection between me, my sax, and the audience. The music flowed through me effortlessly, and the crowd responded to every note, every improvisation. It was like we were all part of this beautiful, spontaneous composition.\n\nWhat made it even more special was that my father was in the audience that night. Seeing the pride in his eyes as I played, knowing I was continuing the family legacy... it was an indescribable feeling. That performance was a perfect blend of the past, the present, and the future of jazz, and it's a night I'll never forget.\nRobert: Who are your biggest musical influences and how have they shaped your style?"
