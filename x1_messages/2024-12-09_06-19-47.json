        "content": "Yes, coffee grounds can help eliminate refrigerator odors. The porous nature of coffee grounds allows them to absorb and neutralize unpleasant smells effectively. To use coffee grounds for this purpose, simply place an open container or a small bowl filled with used coffee grounds inside your refrigerator. Make sure to replace the coffee grounds regularly, preferably every few days, to maintain their effectiveness in absorbing odors. Additionally, you can also try other natural odor absorbers like activated charcoal, baking soda, or even tea leaves for similar results."
