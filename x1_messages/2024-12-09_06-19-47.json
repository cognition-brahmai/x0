        "content": "Alright, I'm going to walk you through creating a simple neural network using Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This is a classic problem in machine learning, and it's a great way to get started with neural networks.\n\nFirst, make sure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install tensorflow\n```\n\nNow, let's start by importing the necessary modules:\n\n```python\nimport keras\nfrom keras.datasets import mnist\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nfrom keras.utils import to_categorical\n```\n\nNext, we need to load the MNIST dataset. Keras has a built-in function to download and load the data, which is convenient:\n\n```python\n# Load the MNIST dataset\n(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\n```\n\nThe MNIST images are 28x28 pixels, and the labels are integers from 0 to 9. We need to preprocess the data before feeding it into the neural network.\n\nFirst, flatten the images from 28x28 pixels to a 1D array of 784 pixels:\n\n```python\n# Flatten the images\ntrain_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28 * 28))\ntest_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28 * 28))\n```\n\nNext, convert the pixel values from integers to floats and normalize them to be between 0 and 1:\n\n```python\n# Normalize the pixel values\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255\n```\n\nNow, let's handle the labels. Since this is a multi-class classification problem, we need to convert the labels to categorical format (one-hot encoding):\n\n```python\n# One-hot encode the labels\ntrain_labels = to_categorical(train_labels)\ntest_labels = to_categorical(test_labels)\n```\n\nWith the data prepared, we can now build our neural network model. We'll create a sequential model with one hidden layer:\n\n```python\n# Build the model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(28 * 28,)))\nmodel.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))\n```\n\nHere, the first layer is a dense (fully connected) layer with 512 units and ReLU activation. The input shape is 784, which matches our flattened images. The second layer is also dense, with 10 units (one for each class) and softmax activation to output probabilities for each class.\n\nNow, we need to compile the model, specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics to track:\n\n```python\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n```\n\nWe're using the Adam optimizer, which is a popular choice, and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification.\n\nNext, train the model on the training data:\n\n```python\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=128)\n```\n\nI've set the number of epochs to 5 and the batch size to 128. You can adjust these parameters as needed.\n\nFinally, evaluate the model on the test data and print the accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Evaluate the model on test data\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)\n```\n\nThat's it! This script will build a simple neural network using Keras, train it on the MNIST dataset, and print out the test accuracy.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple neural network model for the MNIST dataset using Keras, follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**:\n   Ensure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed. You can install them using pip if necessary:\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow\n   ```\n\n2. **Import Necessary Modules**:\n   ```python\n   import keras\n   from keras.datasets import mnist\n   from keras.models import Sequential\n   from keras.layers import Dense\n   from keras.utils import to_categorical\n   ```\n\n3. **Load the MNIST Dataset**:\n   ```python\n   (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\n   ```\n\n4. **Preprocess the Data**:\n   - Flatten the images from 28x28 pixels to a 1D array of 784 pixels.\n   - Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1.\n   - Convert labels to categorical format (one-hot encoding).\n\n   ```python\n   # Flatten the images\n   train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28 * 28))\n   test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28 * 28))\n\n   # Normalize the pixel values\n   train_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255\n   test_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255\n\n   # One-hot encode the labels\n   train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels)\n   test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels)\n   ```\n\n5. **Build the Neural Network Model**:\n   - Create a sequential model.\n   - Add a hidden layer with 512 units and ReLU activation.\n   - Add an output layer with 10 units and softmax activation.\n\n   ```python\n   model = Sequential()\n   model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(28 * 28,)))\n   model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))\n   ```\n\n6. **Compile the Model**:\n   - Use the Adam optimizer.\n   - Use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.\n   - Track accuracy as the metric.\n\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                 loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n                 metrics=['accuracy'])\n   ```\n\n7. **Train the Model**:\n   - Train for 5 epochs with a batch size of 128.\n\n   ```python\n   model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=128)\n   ```\n\n8. **Evaluate the Model**:\n   - Evaluate the model on the test data and print the accuracy.\n\n   ```python\n   test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)\n   print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you will have created a simple neural network using Keras that can classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with a test accuracy printed at the end."
