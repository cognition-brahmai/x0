        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car that travels 120 miles in 3 hours. Then, it increases its speed by 20 mph and travels for another 2 hours. We need to find the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's start by finding the speed of the car during the first part of the trip. It travels 120 miles in 3 hours. So, the speed is distance divided by time:\n\nSpeed = 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 mph.\n\nSo, the car was traveling at 40 mph for the first 3 hours.\n\nNext, it increases its speed by 20 mph. So, the new speed is:\n\n40 mph + 20 mph = 60 mph.\n\nThen, it travels for another 2 hours at this new speed. So, the distance covered in the second part of the trip is:\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, let's find the total distance and total time for the entire trip.\n\nTotal distance = first part distance + second part distance = 120 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles.\n\nTotal time = first part time + second part time = 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire trip is:\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time = 240 miles / 5 hours = 48 mph.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the harmonic mean of the speeds, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Let's see.\n\nThe harmonic mean is used when the distances are the same, but in this case, the times are different, so I think the overall average speed is still the total distance over total time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the weighted average of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, the first speed is 40 mph for 3 hours, and the second speed is 60 mph for 2 hours.\n\nThe weighted average would be:\n\n(40 mph \u00d7 3 hours + 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours) / total time = (120 + 120) / 5 = 240 / 5 = 48 mph.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the average speed formula for two periods:\n\nAverage speed = (d1 + d2) / (t1 + t2),\n\nwhich is again 240 miles / 5 hours = 48 mph.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 48 mph as the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using the concept of average speed in terms of the reciprocal of times or something, but I think that would complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the average speed as the slope of the distance-time graph, but again, that would lead me back to total distance over total time.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The average speed is 48 mph.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick or if I'm missing something in the problem.\n\nThe problem says the car travels 120 miles in 3 hours, then increases its speed by 20 mph and continues for another 2 hours. It doesn't mention any stops or changes in direction, so I can assume the trip is continuous in one direction.\n\nAlso, the units are consistent, both in miles and hours, so no conversion is needed.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the average speed for the entire trip is 48 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
