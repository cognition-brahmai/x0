        "content": "You're referring to an iconic Beatles song inspired by a drawing made by John Lennon's son Julian. The song you're thinking of is \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" According to John Lennon, the title came from a drawing Julian created and titled \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\" which depicted his classmate Lucy O'Donnell. However, the coincidence of the title's initials spelling out \"LSD\" led to speculation that the song was about the hallucinogenic drug, which John Lennon denied in interviews."
