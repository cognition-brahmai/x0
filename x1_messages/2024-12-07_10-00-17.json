The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n\nTo create a Python program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher, we'll need to do the following:\n\n1. **Get user input:** Ask the user for a message and a shift value.\n2. **Encrypt the message:** Shift each letter in the message by the specified number of places.\n3. **Decrypt the message:** Reverse the process to get back the original message.\n\nWe'll need to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, and make sure that non-alphabetic characters are not changed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n- **Step 1:** Define functions for encryption and decryption.\n- **Step 2:** Implement the encryption function.\n- **Step 3:** Implement the decryption function.\n- **Step 4:** Get user input for the message and shift value.\n- **Step 5:** Provide options for the user to choose between encryption and decryption.\n- **Step 6:** Display the result.\n\nLet's start by defining the functions.\n\n### Step 1: Define functions\n\nWe'll create two functions: `encrypt` and `decrypt`.\n\n### Step 2: Implement the encryption function\n\nThe `encrypt` function will take a message and a shift value as inputs and return the encrypted message.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the decryption function\n\nThe `decrypt` function will take an encrypted message and the same shift value to return the original message.\n\n### Step 4: Get user input\n\nWe'll ask the user for the message and the shift value.\n\n### Step 5: Provide options for encryption and decryption\n\nWe'll ask the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message.\n\n### Step 6: Display the result\n\nBased on the user's choice, we'll call the appropriate function and display the result.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher with a user-specified shift value, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Encryption**: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n2. **Decryption**: Each letter in the ciphertext is shifted back by the same number of places to retrieve the plaintext.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(text, shift):\n    encrypted = \"\"\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            # Determine if the character is uppercase or lowercase for correct ASCII range\n            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97\n            # Shift the character and wrap around the alphabet\n            encrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)\n            encrypted += encrypted_char\n        else:\n            # Non-alphabetic characters are added unchanged\n            encrypted += char\n    return encrypted\n\ndef decrypt(encrypted_text, shift):\n    # Decrypting is the same as encrypting with a negative shift\n    return encrypt(encrypted_text, -shift)\n\n# Main program\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        mode = input(\"Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? (Enter 'e' for encrypt, 'd' for decrypt, or 'q' to quit): \").lower()\n        if mode == 'q':\n            break\n        if mode not in ('e', 'd'):\n            print(\"Invalid mode. Please enter 'e', 'd', or 'q'.\")\n            continue\n        shift = int(input(\"Enter the shift value (1-25): \"))\n        if not 1 <= shift <= 25:\n            print(\"Shift value must be between 1 and 25.\")\n            continue\n        text = input(\"Enter the message: \")\n        if mode == 'e':\n            result = encrypt(text, shift)\n            print(\"Encrypted message:\", result)\n        else:\n            result = decrypt(text, shift)\n            print(\"Decrypted message:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Encryption Function**:\n   - Shifts each alphabetical character in the input text by the specified amount.\n   - Non-alphabetical characters are left unchanged.\n   - Uses modulo arithmetic to wrap around the alphabet.\n\n2. **Decryption Function**:\n   - Uses the encryption function with a negative shift to reverse the encryption.\n\n3. **Main Program**:\n   - Loops until the user chooses to quit.\n   - Validates user inputs for mode and shift value.\n   - Calls the appropriate function based on user choice and displays the result."
