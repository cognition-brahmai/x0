        "content": "So Alice rented a car from this company that charges a flat fee of $20 plus $0.10 per mile driven. She drove 150 miles, and I need to find out how much less she paid compared to if she had driven 300 miles. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total cost for driving 150 miles and for driving 300 miles, then find the difference between the two.\n\nStarting with the cost for 150 miles:\n\n- There's a flat fee of $20.\n\n- Plus $0.10 per mile for 150 miles, which is 0.10 * 150 = $15.\n\n- So, total cost for 150 miles is $20 + $15 = $35.\n\nNow, for 300 miles:\n\n- Again, the flat fee is $20.\n\n- Plus $0.10 per mile for 300 miles, which is 0.10 * 300 = $30.\n\n- So, total cost for 300 miles is $20 + $30 = $50.\n\nNow, to find out how much less she paid for driving 150 miles instead of 300 miles, I subtract the cost for 150 miles from the cost for 300 miles:\n\n$50 - $35 = $15.\n\nSo, Alice paid $15 less by driving 150 miles instead of 300 miles.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.\n\nThe difference in miles is 300 - 150 = 150 miles.\n\nSince the cost per mile is $0.10, the additional cost for those extra 150 miles would be 0.10 * 150 = $15.\n\nSo, yes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
