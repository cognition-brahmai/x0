        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a father with three daughters: Alice, Betty, and Cathy. The problem states that Alice is older than Betty but younger than Cathy, and their ages are consecutive prime numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what prime numbers are. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the sequence of prime numbers starts with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and so on.\n\nNow, since their ages are consecutive prime numbers, that means each daughter's age is a prime number, and there are no other prime numbers between their ages.\n\nGiven that Alice is older than Betty but younger than Cathy, it means that Betty is the youngest, Alice is in the middle, and Cathy is the oldest.\n\nSo, if we denote their ages as consecutive primes, let's say:\n\nBetty: p\n\nAlice: p + g (where g is the gap to the next prime)\n\nCathy: p + 2g\n\nWait, actually, that might not be accurate because the gaps between consecutive primes aren't necessarily constant. For example, between 2 and 3 it's 1, between 3 and 5 it's 2, between 5 and 7 it's 2, between 7 and 11 it's 4, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to list out some consecutive primes and see if they fit the age relationships.\n\nLet's list some consecutive primes:\n\n2, 3, 5\n\n3, 5, 7\n\n5, 7, 11\n\n7, 11, 13\n\n11, 13, 17\n\n13, 17, 19\n\n17, 19, 23\n\n23, 29, 31\n\nand so on.\n\nNow, we need to assign these ages to Betty, Alice, and Cathy such that Alice is older than Betty but younger than Cathy.\n\nSo, Betty < Alice < Cathy.\n\nLooking at the lists:\n\n- 2, 3, 5: Betty=2, Alice=3, Cathy=5. That works.\n\n- 3, 5, 7: Betty=3, Alice=5, Cathy=7. Also works.\n\n- 5, 7, 11: Betty=5, Alice=7, Cathy=11. Works.\n\n- 7, 11, 13: Betty=7, Alice=11, Cathy=13. Works.\n\n- 11, 13, 17: Betty=11, Alice=13, Cathy=17. Works.\n\n- 13, 17, 19: Betty=13, Alice=17, Cathy=19. Works.\n\n- 17, 19, 23: Betty=17, Alice=19, Cathy=23. Works.\n\n- 23, 29, 31: Betty=23, Alice=29, Cathy=31. Works.\n\nHmm, so there are multiple possible sets of ages that satisfy the conditions. The problem doesn't provide any additional constraints to narrow it down to a single solution.\n\nWait, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's read the problem again: \"Alice is older than Betty, but younger than Cathy. Their ages are consecutive prime numbers.\" It doesn't specify anything else, like their ages summing up to a certain number or any other relationships.\n\nSo, it seems like there are multiple valid solutions. But perhaps the problem expects the smallest possible ages or something like that.\n\nLet's consider the smallest set: 2, 3, 5.\n\nBut 2 is a pretty young age for a daughter, maybe that's not practical, but mathematically it's valid.\n\nAnother consideration: are there any other constraints that I might have overlooked?\n\nWait, the problem says \"consecutive prime numbers,\" which typically means there are no other prime numbers between them. For example, 2, 3, 5 are consecutive primes because there are no primes between them. Similarly, 3, 5, 7; 5, 7, 11; etc.\n\nBut in the sequence, 2, 3, 5 are consecutive primes, but 3, 5, 7 are also consecutive primes, and so on.\n\nSo, without additional information, it seems like there are multiple valid solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a specific set of ages, but I don't see any way to determine that from the given information.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the ages are consecutive primes in the standard list of primes, with no other primes in between.\n\nGiven that, the possible sets are:\n\n- 2, 3, 5\n\n- 3, 5, 7\n\n- 5, 7, 11\n\n- 7, 11, 13\n\n- 11, 13, 17\n\n- 13, 17, 19\n\n- 17, 19, 23\n\n- 23, 29, 31\n\nand so forth.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify which set to choose, perhaps the answer is that there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nBut maybe there's a unique solution if we consider that the ages are positive integers and that the father has three daughters with ages being consecutive primes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the ages given that they are consecutive primes and satisfy the age relationships, but without more constraints, it's impossible to determine a unique solution.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem is part of a larger set, and there is additional information provided elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to express the ages in terms of variables or to find a general solution.\n\nBut given the way it's phrased, it seems like it's expecting specific ages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps the fact that Alice is older than Betty but younger than Cathy directly implies the ordering, and since the primes are in increasing order, the assignment is straightforward.\n\nIn that case, for any set of three consecutive primes, the youngest daughter is the smallest prime, the middle daughter is the next prime, and the oldest is the next one.\n\nSo, for example, if we take 5, 7, 11, then Betty is 5, Alice is 7, and Cathy is 11.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's hard to pin down a specific set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the smallest possible ages, which would be 2, 3, 5.\n\nBut again, 2 seems very young for a daughter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to acknowledge that there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique solution based on some property of primes.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe \"consecutive primes\" here means that their ages are primes and consecutive in the sense that there are no other primes between them, but perhaps they are not necessarily the smallest possible.\n\nBut in the standard list of primes, that's already the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find three consecutive primes where the difference between the ages is the same, i.e., the primes are in an arithmetic sequence.\n\nWait, but in the list I provided earlier, only 3, 5, 7 have the same difference of 2 between them.\n\nOtherwise, 5, 7, 11 have differences of 2 and 4.\n\n7, 11, 13 have differences of 4 and 2.\n\n11, 13, 17 have differences of 2 and 4.\n\n13, 17, 19 have differences of 4 and 2.\n\n17, 19, 23 have differences of 2 and 4.\n\n23, 29, 31 have differences of 6 and 2.\n\nSo, only 3, 5, 7 have equal differences of 2 between them.\n\nCould it be that the problem is implying that the differences between the ages are equal, making them an arithmetic sequence?\n\nIf that's the case, then the only set of three consecutive primes that form an arithmetic sequence is 3, 5, 7.\n\nIn that case, Betty would be 3, Alice 5, and Cathy 7.\n\nBut the problem doesn't explicitly state that the differences are equal, so I might be reading too much into it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ages to be 3, 5, 7.\n\nBut again, without explicit instruction, it's hard to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on the fact that Alice is older than Betty but younger than Cathy, and their ages are consecutive primes, but that still leaves multiple possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps there is additional information implied by the names or something else, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that there are multiple possible solutions and to list them all.\n\nIn that case, the possible ages are:\n\nSet 1: Betty=2, Alice=3, Cathy=5\n\nSet 2: Betty=3, Alice=5, Cathy=7\n\nSet 3: Betty=5, Alice=7, Cathy=11\n\nSet 4: Betty=7, Alice=11, Cathy=13\n\nSet 5: Betty=11, Alice=13, Cathy=17\n\nSet 6: Betty=13, Alice=17, Cathy=19\n\nSet 7: Betty=17, Alice=19, Cathy=23\n\nSet 8: Betty=23, Alice=29, Cathy=31\n\nand so on.\n\nSo, there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the smallest set where all daughters are older than a certain age, say older than 2 or 3, but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the ages where the differences between the ages are equal, which, as I noted earlier, is only the set 3,5,7.\n\nIn that case, the ages would be Betty=3, Alice=5, Cathy=7.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify that the differences must be equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on the properties of primes, but I don't see it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is missing some information or has a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to set up equations based on the given information and solve for the ages, but since the ages are specified to be consecutive primes, and the relationships are straightforward, there's not much to solve beyond listing the possible sets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nPerhaps the intended solution is simply to choose any set of three consecutive primes and assign them to Betty, Alice, and Cathy in increasing order, with Betty being the youngest.\n\nFor example, choosing 5,7,11: Betty=5, Alice=7, Cathy=11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a specific answer based on typical ages for daughters, but that's subjective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical property of primes that can help determine a unique solution, but I don't see it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that there isn't a unique solution based on the given information.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, there are multiple possible sets of ages for Alice, Betty, and Cathy, all consisting of three consecutive prime numbers with Betty being the youngest, Alice in the middle, and Cathy the oldest.\n\nSome possible sets include:\n\n- Betty: 2, Alice: 3, Cathy: 5\n\n- Betty: 3, Alice: 5, Cathy: 7\n\n- Betty: 5, Alice: 7, Cathy: 11\n\n- Betty: 7, Alice: 11, Cathy: 13\n\n- Betty: 11, Alice: 13, Cathy: 17\n\n- Betty: 13, Alice: 17, Cathy: 19\n\n- Betty: 17, Alice: 19, Cathy: 23\n\n- Betty: 23, Alice: 29, Cathy: 31\n\nand so on.\n\nWithout additional constraints, it's not possible to determine a unique set of ages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Multiple possible solutions exist, such as } (2, 3, 5), (3, 5, 7), (5, 7, 11), \\text{ etc., with Betty being the youngest, Alice in the middle, and Cathy the oldest.}}\\]"
