        "content": "So there's this problem about favorite colors of siblings. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. There are five siblings: three boys and two girls. Each has one favorite color, and no two siblings share the same favorite color. There are seven different colors to choose from. The question is asking for the number of possible combinations of favorite colors for the three boys.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's not just about choosing colors for the boys, but considering that all five siblings have unique favorite colors from a set of seven.\n\nLet me think about the total number of ways to assign favorite colors to all five siblings without any restrictions except that no two have the same favorite color. Since there are seven colors and five siblings, this would be the number of ways to choose five distinct colors out of seven and assign them to the siblings. This is a permutation problem because the order in which we assign the colors matters (since each sibling is distinct).\n\nThe number of ways to choose five distinct colors out of seven and assign them to the siblings is P(7,5), which is 7! / (7-5)! = 7! / 2! = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 2520.\n\nBut that's the total number of ways to assign favorite colors to all five siblings. However, the question is specifically asking for the number of possible combinations of favorite colors for the three boys.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to focus only on the boys and not worry about the girls. But the condition is that no two siblings share the same favorite color, so the girls' choices affect the boys' choices.\n\nLet me try another approach. Since no two siblings share the same favorite color, the favorite colors of the siblings are all distinct.\n\nSo, for the three boys, their favorite colors must be three distinct colors from the seven, and these colors must be different from each other and also different from the favorite colors of the two girls.\n\nBut the problem is only asking for the number of possible combinations of favorite colors for the three boys. It's not specifying anything about the girls' favorite colors, just that all siblings have distinct favorite colors.\n\nPerhaps I can think of it as first choosing three distinct colors for the boys from the seven available, and then the two girls will choose their favorite colors from the remaining four colors, but since the question is only about the boys, maybe I don't need to worry about the girls' choices.\n\nWait, but the girls' choices do affect the boys' choices because the girls cannot choose the same colors as the boys. So, perhaps I need to consider the boys' choices first and then see what's left for the girls.\n\nLet me try to think step by step.\n\nFirst, select three distinct colors for the three boys from the seven available colors. The number of ways to choose three distinct colors from seven is C(7,3), which is 35.\n\nBut wait, C(7,3) is the number of ways to choose three colors without considering the order, but since each boy is distinct and will have a different color, I need to consider the permutations, not just combinations.\n\nSo, it should be P(7,3), which is 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 = 210.\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to assign three distinct colors to the three boys.\n\nBut, the problem is that the two girls will then choose their favorite colors from the remaining four colors, and their choices must also be distinct.\n\nHowever, since the question is only asking for the number of possible combinations of favorite colors for the three boys, perhaps I don't need to consider the girls' choices further.\n\nWait, but if I choose three colors for the boys, that leaves four colors for the girls, and the girls must choose two distinct colors from those four.\n\nThe number of ways the girls can choose their colors is P(4,2) = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nSo, for each way of assigning colors to the boys, there are 12 ways to assign colors to the girls.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to assign colors to all five siblings is 210 (for boys) \u00d7 12 (for girls) = 2520, which matches the earlier calculation of P(7,5) = 2520.\n\nBut again, the question is only asking for the number of possible combinations of favorite colors for the three boys, which is 210.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Perhaps I need to consider that the girls' choices influence which colors are available for the boys.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the girls' favorite colors are already determined, and we're to find out how many ways the boys can choose their favorite colors from the remaining colors.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that the girls' favorite colors are fixed. It just says that there are five siblings, three boys, two girls, each with a unique favorite color, and there are seven colors to choose from.\n\nGiven that, I think the interpretation should be that we're to find the number of ways to assign favorite colors to the three boys from seven colors, with the condition that all five siblings have distinct favorite colors.\n\nBut since the girls' favorite colors aren't specified, perhaps the boys can choose any three distinct colors from the seven, and the girls will choose their favorite colors from the remaining four, ensuring that all favorite colors are distinct.\n\nIn that case, the number of possible combinations for the boys would indeed be P(7,3) = 210.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the girls' favorite colors as part of the total assignment, but since the question is only about the boys, perhaps 210 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I recall that in combinations, the order doesn't matter, whereas in permutations, the order matters. However, in this context, since each sibling has a distinct favorite color, and the siblings are distinct individuals, perhaps the order does matter.\n\nBut in the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the number of possible combinations of favorite colors for the three boys.\n\nNow, \"combinations\" usually refers to selections where order doesn't matter, but in this context, since each boy has a distinct favorite color, perhaps it's more appropriate to think in terms of permutations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as selecting three distinct colors for the boys and then assigning them to the specific boys, considering that each boy is distinct.\n\nIn that case, the number of ways would indeed be P(7,3) = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 = 210.\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps I should consider the boys as distinct individuals and see how many ways to assign colors to them.\n\nLet's assign the favorite colors one by one.\n\nFirst, for the first boy, there are 7 possible colors to choose from.\n\nThen, for the second boy, since his favorite color must be different from the first boy's, there are 6 remaining choices.\n\nSimilarly, for the third boy, there are 5 remaining choices.\n\nSo, total number of ways is 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 = 210.\n\nThis aligns with the earlier calculation of P(7,3) = 210.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible combinations of favorite colors for the three boys is 210.\n\nBut just to be thorough, perhaps I should consider the girls' choices as well.\n\nIf the boys have chosen three colors, then there are four colors left for the girls.\n\nThe first girl can choose any of the remaining four colors, and the second girl can choose any of the remaining three colors.\n\nSo, the number of ways for the girls is 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to assign favorite colors to all five siblings is 210 (boys) \u00d7 12 (girls) = 2520.\n\nBut again, since the question is only about the boys, the answer should be 210.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem intended for us to consider the entire assignment of favorite colors to all siblings, it would have asked for that specifically.\n\nGiven that it's asking only for the three boys, I think 210 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to double-check, perhaps there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider that the seven colors are distinct, and we need to choose three distinct colors for the boys.\n\nThe number of ways to choose three distinct colors from seven is C(7,3) = 35.\n\nHowever, since each boy is distinct and will have a different color, we need to assign these three colors to the three boys.\n\nThe number of ways to assign three distinct colors to three distinct boys is P(3,3) = 3! = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is C(7,3) \u00d7 P(3,3) = 35 \u00d7 6 = 210.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the path I take, I end up with 210 as the number of possible combinations of favorite colors for the three boys.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 210.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]"
