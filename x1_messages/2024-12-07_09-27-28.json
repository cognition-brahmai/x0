        "content": "Let's see. A non-leap year has 365 days, right? And the car factory produces 20 cars every day. So, to find out how many cars it produces in a whole year, I need to multiply the number of cars produced per day by the number of days in a year.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the numbers:\n\n- Cars produced per day: 20\n\n- Days in a non-leap year: 365\n\nNow, I'll multiply these two numbers:\n\n20 cars/day \u00d7 365 days = ?\n\nI can break this down to make it easier. I know that 365 is equal to 300 + 60 + 5, so:\n\n20 \u00d7 300 = 6,000\n\n20 \u00d7 60 = 1,200\n\n20 \u00d7 5 = 100\n\nNow, I'll add these products together:\n\n6,000 + 1,200 = 7,200\n\n7,200 + 100 = 7,300\n\nSo, the factory produces 7,300 cars in a non-leap year.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can use the fact that 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks plus 1 day, but I'm not sure if that helps here. Or perhaps I can think about it in months, but months have different numbers of days, which might not be as straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that multiplying 20 by 365 is the same as multiplying 20 by 365. I know that 20 times 100 is 2,000, so 20 times 300 would be 6,000. Then 20 times 60 is 1,200, and 20 times 5 is 100. Adding those up again gives me 7,300. That matches my earlier calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nIs there a chance I missed something? Let's think about leap years. The question specified a non-leap year, so I don't need to account for an extra day. That's good.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the annual production rate. If the factory produces 20 cars per day, and there are 365 days in a non-leap year, then the annual production should indeed be 20 \u00d7 365 = 7,300 cars.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider the production per week. There are 7 days in a week, so 20 cars/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 140 cars/week. Then, there are 52 weeks in a year, so 140 cars/week \u00d7 52 weeks/year = 7,280 cars/year. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmmm.\n\nWait a second, 52 weeks amount to 52 \u00d7 7 = 364 days, which is one day less than 365 days. So, in a non-leap year, there's an extra day beyond the 52 weeks. Therefore, I need to account for that extra day. So, 7,280 cars from the 52 weeks plus 20 cars from the extra day: 7,280 + 20 = 7,300 cars. Okay, now it matches my initial calculation.\n\nThis reinforces that the total production is 7,300 cars in a non-leap year.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using larger time units, like months. But since months have different numbers of days, it might not be as precise or straightforward. It's probably better to stick with the daily production and the total number of days in the year.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is 7,300 cars produced in a non-leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7300} \\]"
