To create a JavaScript function that checks if a number is a perfect square, we can use the mathematical property that a perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 16 is a perfect square because it's 4 squared, but 14 is not a perfect square because there's no integer that, when squared, equals 14.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to building this function:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to determine if a given number is a perfect square. This means that the square root of the number should be an integer.\n\n2. **Mathematical Approach**: We can find the square root of the number and then check if it's an integer. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square.\n\n3. **Implementing in JavaScript**:\n   - Use the `Math.sqrt()` function to find the square root of the number.\n   - Use the `Number.isInteger()` method to check if the square root is an integer.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and non-integer inputs. For instance, negative numbers cannot be perfect squares, and zero is a perfect square (0 squared is 0).\n\n5. **Function Structure**:\n   - Define a function, say `isPerfectSquare`, that takes one parameter, the number to check.\n   - Inside the function, handle edge cases first.\n   - Compute the square root and check if it's an integer.\n   - Return `true` if it's a perfect square, otherwise `false`.\n\nLet's write the code based on this approach:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isPerfectSquare(num) {\n    // Negative numbers and non-integers cannot be perfect squares\n    if (num < 0 || !Number.isInteger(num)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // Compute the square root\n    const sqrt = Math.sqrt(num);\n    \n    // Check if the square root is an integer\n    return Number.isInteger(sqrt);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconsole.log(isPerfectSquare(16)); // true\nconsole.log(isPerfectSquare(14)); // false\nconsole.log(isPerfectSquare(-4)); // false\nconsole.log(isPerfectSquare(0));  // true\nconsole.log(isPerfectSquare(2.5));// false\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the number is negative or not an integer, it immediately returns `false` because perfect squares are non-negative integers.\n\n2. **Square Root Calculation**:\n   - We use `Math.sqrt(num)` to find the square root of the number.\n\n3. **Integer Check**:\n   - We use `Number.isInteger(sqrt)` to check if the square root is an integer. If it is, the number is a perfect square.\n\nThis function is efficient and straightforward, providing a clear way to determine if a number is a perfect square in JavaScript."
