        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. I have a game where I have different chances of winning on each of the first three turns. Specifically:\n\n- On the first turn, I have a 1 in 4 chance of winning.\n\n- On the second turn, if I didn't win on the first turn, I have a 1 in 3 chance of winning.\n\n- On the third turn, if I didn't win on the first two turns, I have a 1 in 2 chance of winning.\n\nAnd I need to find out the probability that I will win within these first three turns.\n\nOkay, so probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. I think the key here is to consider the probability of winning on each turn, but also taking into account that if I win on one turn, I don't proceed to the next turns.\n\nSo, one way to approach this is to calculate the probability of winning on each turn and then add them up, but making sure to account for the fact that I only get to later turns if I didn't win on the earlier ones.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nFirst, the probability of winning on the first turn is given as 1/4.\n\nSo, P(win on 1st) = 1/4.\n\nNow, the probability of winning on the second turn is 1/3, but only if I didn't win on the first turn. So, I need to multiply the probability of not winning on the first turn by the probability of winning on the second turn.\n\nP(win on 2nd) = P(not win on 1st) * P(win on 2nd) = (1 - 1/4) * 1/3 = (3/4) * 1/3 = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of winning on the third turn is 1/2, but only if I didn't win on the first two turns. So, I need to multiply the probability of not winning on the first turn, not winning on the second turn, by the probability of winning on the third turn.\n\nP(win on 3rd) = P(not win on 1st) * P(not win on 2nd) * P(win on 3rd) = (3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) = (3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) = (3*2*1)/(4*3*2) = 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. Each of these probabilities is 1/4.\n\nSo, P(win on 1st) = 1/4\n\nP(win on 2nd) = 1/4\n\nP(win on 3rd) = 1/4\n\nNow, to find the total probability of winning within the first three turns, I can add these up.\n\nP(win within first 3 turns) = P(win on 1st) + P(win on 2nd) + P(win on 3rd) = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there's another way to look at this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the probability of not winning within the first three turns and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, P(not win within first 3 turns) = P(not win on 1st) * P(not win on 2nd) * P(not win on 3rd).\n\nWe already have:\n\nP(not win on 1st) = 3/4\n\nP(not win on 2nd) = 2/3\n\nP(not win on 3rd) = 1/2\n\nSo, P(not win within first 3 turns) = (3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, P(win within first 3 turns) = 1 - P(not win within first 3 turns) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nOkay, so both approaches give me the same answer, which is 3/4.\n\nLet me see if there's yet another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I consider all possible outcomes within the three turns.\n\n- Win on 1st turn: probability 1/4\n\n- Lose 1st, win 2nd: (3/4)*(1/3) = 1/4\n\n- Lose 1st and 2nd, win 3rd: (3/4)*(2/3)*(1/2) = 1/4\n\n- Lose all three: (3/4)*(2/3)*(1/2) = 1/4\n\nSo, the total probability sums up to 1, which makes sense.\n\nAnd the probability of winning within the first three turns is the sum of the first three outcomes: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of mutual exclusivity, the events of winning on the first, second, or third turn are mutually exclusive because I stop playing once I win.\n\nTherefore, I can indeed add their probabilities directly.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that the probability of winning within the first three turns is 3/4.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any dependency between the turns beyond what's already accounted for?\n\nWell, the probabilities are given conditional on not having won in previous turns, which I've already incorporated into the calculations.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the overall probability by summing the individual probabilities, considering the paths to each winning scenario.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Winning on the first turn: probability 1/4\n\n- Winning on the second turn: probability (3/4)*(1/3) = 1/4\n\n- Winning on the third turn: probability (3/4)*(2/3)*(1/2) = 1/4\n\nAdding these up gives 3/4, as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a geometric series, but given the specific probabilities for each turn, it's more straightforward to handle it this way.\n\nI should also consider if the turns are independent events, but in this scenario, they're not, because the game stops if I win on a earlier turn.\n\nHowever, in the calculation, I've already accounted for that by considering the probability of reaching each turn without having won earlier.\n\nSo, I think my approach is sound.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning within the first three turns is 3/4.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if I were to naively add the probabilities without considering the dependencies.\n\nThat is, just add 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2.\n\nThat would be 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 3/12 + 4/12 + 6/12 = 13/12, which is more than 1, which doesn't make sense because probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nSo, that reinforces that I need to account for the dependencies between the turns.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I can think in terms of conditional probabilities.\n\nFor instance, the probability of winning on the second turn is conditional on not winning on the first turn.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of winning on the third turn is conditional on not winning on the first two turns.\n\nI've already accounted for that in the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the law of total probability, but in this case, it's somewhat unnecessary because the events are mutually exclusive.\n\nWait, in this context, the events are mutually exclusive because I can't win on multiple turns; I stop once I win.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of winning within the first three turns is simply the sum of the probabilities of winning on each individual turn, considering the conditions.\n\nSo, again, P(win within first 3 turns) = P(win on 1st) + P(win on 2nd | lose 1st) * P(lose 1st) + P(win on 3rd | lose 1st and 2nd) * P(lose 1st and 2nd).\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the survival function, which is the probability of not having won by a certain turn.\n\nP(not win within first n turns).\n\nIn this case, P(not win within first 3 turns) = P(lose 1st) * P(lose 2nd | lose 1st) * P(lose 3rd | lose 1st and 2nd) = (3/4)*(2/3)*(1/2) = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, P(win within first 3 turns) = 1 - P(not win within first 3 turns) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nThis aligns with all the previous methods I've used.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is indeed 3/4.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other perspective that might question this result.\n\nSuppose I simulate the game many times and record the outcomes.\n\nOn each simulation, I proceed through the turns, checking if I win on each turn, and stop when I win.\n\nI repeat this process a large number of times and calculate the proportion of games where I won within the first three turns.\n\nGiven the probabilities, I should expect this proportion to approach 3/4 as the number of simulations increases.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of expected value, but that might not directly give me the probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of decision trees.\n\nEach turn is a branch in the tree, with probabilities assigned to winning or losing at each turn.\n\nThe tree would have three levels, corresponding to the three turns.\n\nAt each level, there are two branches: win or lose.\n\nBut, since the game stops once I win, some paths terminate early.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Win on 1st turn: probability 1/4\n\n- Lose 1st (3/4), then win on 2nd (1/3): total probability (3/4)*(1/3)=1/4\n\n- Lose 1st (3/4), lose 2nd (2/3), then win on 3rd (1/2): total probability (3/4)*(2/3)*(1/2)=1/4\n\n- Lose all three: (3/4)*(2/3)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nAgain, the probabilities sum to 1, and the winning probabilities sum to 3/4.\n\nSo, from multiple angles, the answer consistently points to 3/4.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently conclude that the probability of winning within the first three turns is 3/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}} \\]\n"
