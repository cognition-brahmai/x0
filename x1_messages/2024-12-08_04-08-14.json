        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that fetches weather data from an external API, like OpenWeatherMap, for a specific city. Then, I need to process this data to find the average temperature, humidity, and pressure over a week and finally, generate a summary report in PDF format using ReportLab. Sounds interesting! Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to get access to the OpenWeatherMap API. I've heard of it, but I'm not sure how to use it. I think I need to sign up and get an API key. Once I have that, I can make requests to their server to get weather data for any city.\n\nSo, step one: Sign up for OpenWeatherMap and get an API key.\n\nNext, I need to figure out which endpoint to use for getting the weather data for a week. I think OpenWeatherMap has a 'forecast' or 'daily' endpoint that provides data for multiple days. I should check their documentation to see exactly which endpoint gives me the data I need.\n\nStep two: Look up OpenWeatherMap API documentation to find the appropriate endpoint for weekly weather data.\n\nOnce I have the endpoint, I'll need to construct the API request URL with the city name and my API key. I might also need to specify the units I want, like Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on what's preferred.\n\nStep three: Construct the API request URL with the necessary parameters.\n\nNow, I need to use the 'requests' library in Python to send this GET request to the OpenWeatherMap server and retrieve the data. I should handle any possible errors, like if the city isn't found or if there's a problem with the API key.\n\nStep four: Use the requests library to fetch the data from the API.\n\nAfter getting the data, which will probably be in JSON format, I need to parse it and extract the temperature, humidity, and pressure for each day of the week. Then, I'll calculate the average for each of these parameters over the week.\n\nStep five: Parse the JSON data and calculate the averages.\n\nFinally, I need to generate a PDF report using ReportLab. I'm not very familiar with ReportLab, so I might need to look up some tutorials on how to create a simple PDF with text and maybe some charts if possible.\n\nStep six: Use ReportLab to generate a PDF summary report with the averages.\n\nLet me think about the overall structure of the script. It should probably start by asking the user for the city name. Then, it constructs the API request, fetches the data, processes it, and finally generates the PDF.\n\nI should also make sure that the script is user-friendly and handles errors gracefully. For example, if the city name is misspelled or if there's no internet connection, it should inform the user appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need to install the necessary libraries if I don't have them already. So, I'll need 'requests' and 'reportlab'. I think both are straightforward to install via pip.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code terms:\n\n1. Import necessary libraries:\n\nimport requests\n\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\n\n2. Get user input for the city name.\n\n3. Construct the API URL with the city name and API key.\n\n4. Send a GET request to the API URL.\n\n5. Check if the request was successful.\n\n6. Parse the JSON data.\n\n7. Extract temperature, humidity, and pressure for each day.\n\n8. Calculate averages for each parameter.\n\n9. Use ReportLab to create a PDF with the averages.\n\n10. Save the PDF and inform the user.\n\nNow, let's think about the details for each step.\n\nFor step 3, constructing the API URL, I need to know the base URL and the parameters to include. For OpenWeatherMap, it might look something like:\n\nurl = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric\"\n\nI'm assuming I want the data in metric units.\n\nIn step 4, sending the GET request:\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nThen, in step 5, checking if the request was successful:\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n\n# proceed\n\nelse:\n\n# handle error\n\nFor step 6, parsing the JSON data:\n\ndata = response.json()\n\nNow, I need to understand the structure of the JSON data to extract the required information. In OpenWeatherMap's forecast data, there are list of dictionaries, each representing a timestamp with weather data.\n\nI need to collect data for each day over a week. Maybe I can group the data by date and then calculate averages for each day, and then average those daily averages to get the weekly average.\n\nAlternatively, I can just take the average of all the data points over the week, assuming the data is provided at regular intervals.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume the data is provided every 3 hours, so there are 8 data points per day. I can loop through all the data points, collect the temperatures, humidities, and pressures, and then calculate the averages.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntemperatures = [entry['main']['temp'] for entry in data['list']]\n\nhumidity = [entry['main']['humidity'] for entry in data['list']]\n\npressure = [entry['main']['pressure'] for entry in data['list']]\n\nThen, calculate the averages:\n\navg_temp = sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures)\n\navg_humidity = sum(humidity) / len(humidity)\n\navg_pressure = sum(pressure) / len(pressure)\n\nFor step 9, using ReportLab to create a PDF, I need to create a canvas and add text to it.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\n\ndef create_pdf\u62a5\u544a():\n\nc = canvas.Canvas(\"weather_report.pdf\")\n\nc.drawString(100, 750, \"Weather Report for [City]\")\n\nc.drawString(100, 730, f\"Average Temperature: {avg_temp}\u00b0C\")\n\nc.drawString(100, 710, f\"Average Humidity: {avg_humidity}%\")\n\nc.drawString(100, 690, f\"Average Pressure: {avg_pressure} hPa\")\n\nc.save()\n\nI need to make sure to replace [City] with the actual city name.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding more formatting to make the PDF look better, like using different fonts, sizes, and maybe even adding a title page.\n\nBut for now, this simple version should suffice.\n\nLet me think about error handling. What if the city name is invalid? OpenWeatherMap might return a 404 status code or some error in the JSON response.\n\nI need to check for that and inform the user accordingly.\n\nAlso, what if there's no internet connection? The requests library might raise a ConnectionError.\n\nSo, I should wrap the requests.get() call in a try-except block to handle such errors.\n\nSimilarly, if the API key is invalid, OpenWeatherMap will return an error.\n\nI need to check the 'cod' field in the JSON response. If it's 200, it's OK, else, there's an error.\n\nWait, in HTTP status codes, 200 is OK, but in some APIs, they use 'cod' field in JSON to indicate success or failure.\n\nI should check both the HTTP status code and the 'cod' field in the JSON.\n\nFor example:\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n\ndata = response.json()\n\nif data['cod'] == '200':\n\n# proceed\n\nelse:\n\n# handle error\n\nelse:\n\n# handle HTTP error\n\nActually, looking back at OpenWeatherMap documentation, I see that they use 'cod' field in the JSON to indicate success or failure.\n\nFor example, 'cod': '200' indicates OK, 'cod': '404' indicates city not found, etc.\n\nSo, I should check both the HTTP status code and the 'cod' field.\n\nNow, about the units. I'm using the 'metric' unit in the API call, which should give me temperature in Celsius, pressure in hPa, and humidity in percent.\n\nI should make sure that the units are consistent.\n\nAlso, I might want to round off the average values to one or two decimal places for better readability.\n\nFor example:\n\navg_temp = round(sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures), 2)\n\nSimilarly for humidity and pressure.\n\nNow, regarding the time zone. OpenWeatherMap provides time in UTC by default, but maybe I need to convert it to the local time zone of the city.\n\nHmm, but since I'm averaging the data over a week, perhaps time zone conversion isn't necessary for this particular task.\n\nBut if I were to display the data per day, I might need to consider that.\n\nFor now, I'll skip time zone conversion.\n\nAnother thing is that OpenWeatherMap's forecast might not cover exactly one week. It usually provides data for the next 5 days, every 3 hours.\n\nSo, if I want a week's data, I might need to make multiple API calls or find another endpoint that provides longer forecasts.\n\nWait, their 'forecast' endpoint provides data for the next 5 days, which is 40 timestamps (every 3 hours). If I need a week's data, I might need to use the 'daily' endpoint, which provides daily forecasts for up to 16 days.\n\nLooking back at the OpenWeatherMap API documentation, I see that the 'forecast' endpoint provides data for the next 5 days, every 3 hours, while the 'one call' endpoint can provide daily forecasts up to 7 days or more.\n\nI think 'one call' endpoint would be more suitable for getting daily data for a week.\n\nSo, perhaps I should use the 'one call' API instead of the 'forecast' endpoint.\n\nLet me check the 'one call' API documentation.\n\nYes, the 'one call' API provides current weather, minute-by-minute forecast, hourly forecast, and daily forecast up to 7 days, all in one API call.\n\nThat sounds perfect for my needs.\n\nSo, I'll switch to using the 'one call' API.\n\nFirst, I need to sign up for the 'one call' API on OpenWeatherMap.\n\nWait, actually, OpenWeatherMap provides different plans, and some features might require a paid plan.\n\nI need to check if the 'one call' API is available in the free tier.\n\nChecking OpenWeatherMap pricing page, it seems that the 'one call' API is available in the free tier, but with some limitations, like lower update frequency.\n\nFor my purposes, the free tier should suffice.\n\nSo, step one is to sign up for OpenWeatherMap and get an API key for the 'one call' API.\n\nOnce I have the API key, I can make requests to the 'one call' endpoint.\n\nNow, I need to construct the API URL for the 'one call' API.\n\nFrom the documentation, the base URL is:\n\nhttps://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall\n\nI need to provide the latitude and longitude of the city, along with the API key.\n\nSo, first, I need to get the latitude and longitude of the city.\n\nTo do that, I can use the OpenWeatherMap 'geocoding' API to search for the city and get its coordinates.\n\nSo, perhaps step two is to use the 'geocoding' API to get the lat and lon for the given city name.\n\nThen, use those coordinates in the 'one call' API request.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'one call' API has a way to directly accept the city name, but from what I see, it requires lat and lon.\n\nSo, I'll need to use the 'geocoding' API first to get the coordinates.\n\nTherefore, my process is:\n\n1. Use 'geocoding' API to get lat and lon for the city name.\n\n2. Use 'one call' API with the lat and lon to get the daily forecast for the next 7 days.\n\n3. Extract the daily temperature, humidity, and pressure.\n\n4. Calculate the averages over the 7 days.\n\n5. Generate a PDF report with ReportLab.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet me think about step 1 in more detail.\n\nI need to make a request to the 'geocoding' API with the city name and get the coordinates.\n\nThe 'geocoding' API endpoint is:\n\nhttp://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city name}&limit={limit}&appid={API key}\n\nI can set limit=1 to get only the first result.\n\nSo, constructing the URL:\n\ngeocode_url = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city}&limit=1&appid={api_key}\"\n\nThen, send a GET request to this URL and parse the JSON response to get the lat and lon.\n\nAssuming the city is found, the JSON will be a list with one dictionary, containing 'lat' and 'lon' keys.\n\nSo, lat = data[0]['lat']\n\nlon = data[0]['lon']\n\nThen, use these lat and lon in the 'one call' API request.\n\nThe 'one call' API URL is:\n\nonecall_url = f\"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude={part}&appid={api_key}\"\n\nI need to set the 'exclude' parameter to exclude unnecessary parts, like hourly or minutely data, since I only need daily data.\n\nSo, exclude='minutely,hourly,alerts'\n\nTherefore:\n\nonecall_url = f\"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude=minutely,hourly,alerts&appid={api_key}\"\n\nThen, send a GET request to this URL and parse the JSON response.\n\nIn the JSON, the 'daily' key will contain a list of dictionaries, each representing a day's forecast.\n\nI need to extract the 'temp' (which contains 'day' temperature), 'humidity', and 'pressure' for each day.\n\nWait, in OpenWeatherMap's 'one call' API, the 'daily' section contains 'temp' which has 'day', 'min', 'max', etc., 'humidity', and 'pressure' under 'pressure'.\n\nSo, I can collect the 'temp'->'day', 'humidity', and 'pressure' for each day.\n\nThen, calculate the averages over the 7 days.\n\nLet me think about how to ensure I get exactly 7 days of data.\n\nFrom the 'daily' list, I can take the first 7 entries, assuming it provides at least 7 days of data.\n\nBut I should check the length of the 'daily' list to make sure.\n\nIf it's less than 7 days, maybe due to some API limitations, I'll average over whatever data is available.\n\nBut ideally, it should provide 7 days.\n\nNow, regarding the units, I'll use the 'units' parameter in the 'one call' API to get the data in metric units.\n\nSo, units='metric'\n\nThen, the temperature will be in Celsius, pressure in hPa, and humidity in %.\n\nUpdating the 'one call' URL:\n\nonecall_url = f\"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude=minutely,hourly,alerts&appid={api_key}&units=metric\"\n\nNow, in the JSON response, 'daily' will be a list of dictionaries, each containing 'temp'->'day', 'humidity', and 'pressure'.\n\nI can collect these values and calculate averages.\n\nFor example:\n\ntemps = [day['temp']['day'] for day in data['daily'][:7]]\n\nhumidity = [day['humidity'] for day in data['daily'][:7]]\n\npressure = [day['pressure'] for day in data['daily'][:7]]\n\nThen, calculate averages:\n\navg_temp = sum(temps) / len(temps)\n\navg_humidity = sum(humidity) / len(humidity)\n\navg_pressure = sum(pressure) / len(pressure)\n\nAgain, rounding off to two decimal places.\n\nNow, for generating the PDF report using ReportLab, I need to install the reportlab library if I don't have it already.\n\nI can install it using pip:\n\npip install reportlab\n\nThen, I can use the canvas to create the PDF.\n\nI need to set the page size, add a title, and then add the average values.\n\nI can also add some formatting, like bold text for the title, and aligned text for the averages.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\n\ndef create_pdf_report(city, avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure):\n\nc = canvas.Canvas(\"weather_report.pdf\")\n\nc.setFont(\"Helvetica-Bold\", 16)\n\nc.drawString(100, 750, \"Weather Report for \" + city)\n\nc.setFont(\"Helvetica\", 12)\n\nc.drawString(100, 730, f\"Average Temperature: {avg_temp}\u00b0C\")\n\nc.drawString(100, 710, f\"Average Humidity: {avg_humidity}%\")\n\nc.drawString(100, 690, f\"Average Pressure: {avg_pressure} hPa\")\n\nc.save()\n\nThis will create a PDF named 'weather_report.pdf' with the report.\n\nI can make it more fancy by adding borders, images, or a logo, but for now, this should suffice.\n\nNow, I need to put all these steps together in a Python script.\n\nI should also handle errors properly.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the city is not found by the geocoding API, inform the user.\n\n- If there's an error with the 'one call' API, inform the user.\n\n- If there's no internet connection, handle the exception.\n\nSo, I'll use try-except blocks to handle these scenarios.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the user inputs a valid city name.\n\nPerhaps I can allow the user to enter the city name via command line arguments or via input() function.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll use the input() function to ask the user for the city name.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence of the script:\n\n1. Import necessary libraries: requests and reportlab.\n\n2. Ask the user for the city name.\n\n3. Make a request to the geocoding API to get lat and lon.\n\n4. Check if the city is found; if not, inform the user.\n\n5. If city is found, make a request to the 'one call' API with lat and lon.\n\n6. Parse the JSON response to extract daily temperature, humidity, and pressure.\n\n7. Calculate the averages.\n\n8. Generate a PDF report using ReportLab with the averages.\n\n9. Inform the user that the report has been generated.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like:\n\n- City name with spaces or special characters.\n\n- Cities with the same name in different countries.\n\nFor the first case, I can handle spaces by URL encoding, but since I'm using f-strings with variables, requests library should handle it.\n\nFor the second case, perhaps I can ask the user to input the country code or select the correct city from a list, but that might be too complicated for this script.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll assume that the geocoding API returns the correct city for the given name.\n\nNow, let's think about the error handling in code.\n\nFor the geocoding API request:\n\ntry:\n\nresponse = requests.get(geocode_url)\n\nresponse.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an exception for bad status codes\n\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n\nprint(\"Error fetching geolocation data:\", e)\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nThen, check the JSON response:\n\ndata = response.json()\n\nif not data:\n\nprint(\"City not found.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nOtherwise, extract lat and lon.\n\nSimilarly, for the 'one call' API request:\n\ntry:\n\nresponse = requests.get(onecall_url)\n\nresponse.raise_for_status()\n\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n\nprint(\"Error fetching weather data:\", e)\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nThen, parse the JSON and extract the required data.\n\nI need to make sure that the 'daily' list has at least some entries before trying to access them.\n\nIf it's empty, inform the user that no weather data is available.\n\nNow, about the ReportLab part, it's relatively straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure that the file is saved with a meaningful name, perhaps including the city name.\n\nFor example, \"weather_report_{city}.pdf\"\n\nBut I need to sanitize the city name to avoid invalid filename characters.\n\nI can replace spaces with underscores or remove special characters.\n\nAlternatively, I can just name it \"weather_report.pdf\" and let the user rename it if needed.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and use \"weather_report.pdf\"\n\nFinally, I should inform the user where the report is saved.\n\nprint(\"Weather report generated and saved as 'weather_report.pdf'\")\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the code.\n\nI can write a main function that orchestrates all these steps.\n\nBut since it's a simple script, perhaps just write the code in the global scope with proper sequencing.\n\nAlternatively, I can define functions for each step, like get_geolocation(city), get_weather_data(lat, lon), calculate_averages(data), generate_pdf(city, averages), etc.\n\nThis would make the code more modular and easier to read.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure:\n\nimport requests\n\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\n\nimport sys\n\ndef get_geolocation(city, api_key):\n\n# Construct geocoding API URL\n\n# Make GET request\n\n# Parse JSON and extract lat and lon\n\n# Return lat and lon\n\ndef get_weather_data(lat, lon, api_key):\n\n# Construct 'one call' API URL\n\n# Make GET request\n\n# Parse JSON and extract daily data\n\n# Return daily data\n\ndef calculate_averages(daily_data):\n\n# Extract temps, humidity, pressure\n\n# Calculate averages\n\n# Return avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure\n\ndef generate_pdf_report(city, avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure):\n\n# Create PDF with ReportLab\n\n# Save as 'weather_report.pdf'\n\ndef main():\n\n# Get city from user\n\n# Get geolocation\n\n# Get weather data\n\n# Calculate averages\n\n# Generate PDF\n\n# Inform user\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nmain()\n\nThis looks good.\n\nNow, I need to implement each function.\n\nStarting with get_geolocation:\n\ndef get_geolocation(city, api_key):\n\ngeocode_url = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city}&limit=1&appid={api_key}\"\n\ntry:\n\nresponse = requests.get(geocode_url)\n\nresponse.raise_for_status()\n\ndata = response.json()\n\nif data:\n\nreturn data[0]['lat'], data[0]['lon']\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\"City not found.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n\nprint(\"Error fetching geolocation data:\", e)\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nNext, get_weather_data:\n\ndef get_weather_data(lat, lon, api_key):\n\nonecall_url = f\"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude=minutely,hourly,alerts&appid={api_key}&units=metric\"\n\ntry:\n\nresponse = requests.get(onecall_url)\n\nresponse.raise_for_status()\n\ndata = response.json()\n\nif 'daily' in data:\n\nreturn data['daily'][:7]\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\"No daily weather data available.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n\nprint(\"Error fetching weather data:\", e)\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nThen, calculate_averages:\n\ndef calculate_averages(daily_data):\n\ntemps = [day['temp']['day'] for day in daily_data]\n\nhumidity = [day['humidity'] for day in daily_data]\n\npressure = [day['pressure'] for day in daily_data]\n\navg_temp = sum(temps) / len(temps)\n\navg_humidity = sum(humidity) / len(humidity)\n\navg_pressure = sum(pressure) / len(pressure)\n\nreturn round(avg_temp, 2), round(avg_humidity, 2), round(avg_pressure, 2)\n\nFinally, generate_pdf_report:\n\ndef generate_pdf_report(city, avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure):\n\nc = canvas.Canvas(\"weather_report.pdf\")\n\nc.setFont(\"Helvetica-Bold\", 16)\n\nc.drawString(100, 750, \"Weather Report for \" + city)\n\nc.setFont(\"Helvetica\", 12)\n\nc.drawString(100, 730, f\"Average Temperature: {avg_temp}\u00b0C\")\n\nc.drawString(100, 710, f\"Average Humidity: {avg_humidity}%\")\n\nc.drawString(100, 690, f\"Average Pressure: {avg_pressure} hPa\")\n\nc.save()\n\nNow, in the main function:\n\ndef main():\n\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'\n\ncity = input(\"Enter the city name: \")\n\nlat, lon = get_geolocation(city, api_key)\n\ndaily_data = get_weather_data(lat, lon, api_key)\n\navg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure = calculate_averages(daily_data)\n\ngenerate_pdf_report(city, avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure)\n\nprint(\"Weather report generated and saved as 'weather_report.pdf'\")\n\nWait, I need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with the actual API key.\n\nBut hardcoding the API key in the script isn't secure.\n\nI should consider getting the API key from an environment variable or from a config file.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that the user will replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with their actual API key.\n\nAlternatively, I can prompt the user to enter the API key, but that might not be convenient if they need to run the script multiple times.\n\nAnother option is to read the API key from a file, like 'api_key.txt'.\n\nI can check if the file exists, and if not, prompt the user to create it with their API key.\n\nThis way, the API key isn't hardcoded in the script.\n\nLet me implement that.\n\nFirst, import os to handle file operations.\n\nimport os\n\nThen, define a function to read the API key from a file.\n\ndef read_api_key():\n\nkey_file = 'api_key.txt'\n\nif os.path.exists(key_file):\n\nwith open(key_file, 'r') as file:\n\napi_key = file.read().strip()\n\nreturn api_key\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\"API key file not found. Please create 'api_key.txt' with your OpenWeatherMap API key.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nThen, in the main function:\n\napi_key = read_api_key()\n\ncity = input(\"Enter the city name: \")\n\nlat, lon = get_geolocation(city, api_key)\n\ndaily_data = get_weather_data(lat, lon, api_key)\n\navg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure = calculate_averages(daily_data)\n\ngenerate_pdf_report(city, avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure)\n\nprint(\"Weather report generated and saved as 'weather_report.pdf'\")\n\nThis way, the user needs to have an 'api_key.txt' file in the same directory with their API key.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all necessary modules are imported.\n\nI've already imported requests, reportlab, sys, and os.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nNow, I should test the script with a sample city name and see if it works as expected.\n\nFor example, let's say I enter \"London\".\n\nThe geocoding API should return the lat and lon for London.\n\nThen, the 'one call' API should return the daily forecast for the next 7 days.\n\nI extract the temperature, humidity, and pressure for each day, calculate the averages, and generate the PDF.\n\nI can open the PDF to see if the report is correctly generated.\n\nI should also test with a city that doesn't exist or has spelling mistakes to see if the error handling works.\n\nSimilarly, I can test with no internet connection to see if the script handles that gracefully.\n\nOnce I'm satisfied with the functionality, I can consider adding more features, like handling multiple cities, providing more detailed reports, or even adding graphs using ReportLab's drawing capabilities.\n\nBut for now, this should meet the requirements.\n\nAlright, I think I'm done with the script.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo complete this task, we will create a Python script that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a given city, processes the data to calculate average temperature, humidity, and pressure over a week, and generates a summary report in PDF format using the ReportLab library.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Sign up for OpenWeatherMap API**: Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.\n2. **Install necessary libraries**:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests reportlab\n   ```\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndef read_api_key():\n    key_file = 'api_key.txt'\n    if os.path.exists(key_file):\n        with open(key_file, 'r') as file:\n            api_key = file.read().strip()\n        return api_key\n    else:\n        print(\"API key file not found. Please create 'api_key.txt' with your OpenWeatherMap API key.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef get_geolocation(city, api_key):\n    geocode_url = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city}&limit=1&appid={api_key}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(geocode_url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data[0]['lat'], data[0]['lon']\n        else:\n            print(\"City not found.\")\n            sys.exit(1)\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(\"Error fetching geolocation data:\", e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef get_weather_data(lat, lon, api_key):\n    onecall_url = f\"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude=minutely,hourly,alerts&appid={api_key}&units=metric\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(onecall_url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if 'daily' in data:\n            return data['daily'][:7]\n        else:\n            print(\"No daily weather data available.\")\n            sys.exit(1)\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(\"Error fetching weather data:\", e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef calculate_averages(daily_data):\n    temps = [day['temp']['day'] for day in daily_data]\n    humidity = [day['humidity'] for day in daily_data]\n    pressure = [day['pressure'] for day in daily_data]\n    avg_temp = sum(temps) / len(temps)\n    avg_humidity = sum(humidity) / len(humidity)\n    avg_pressure = sum(pressure) / len(pressure)\n    return round(avg_temp, 2), round(avg_humidity, 2), round(avg_pressure, 2)\n\ndef generate_pdf_report(city, avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure):\n    c = canvas.Canvas(\"weather_report.pdf\")\n    c.setFont(\"Helvetica-Bold\", 16)\n    c.drawString(100, 750, \"Weather Report for \" + city)\n    c.setFont(\"Helvetica\", 12)\n    c.drawString(100, 730, f\"Average Temperature: {avg_temp}\u00b0C\")\n    c.drawString(100, 710, f\"Average Humidity: {avg_humidity}%\")\n    c.drawString(100, 690, f\"Average Pressure: {avg_pressure} hPa\")\n    c.save()\n\ndef main():\n    api_key = read_api_key()\n    city = input(\"Enter the city name: \")\n    lat, lon = get_geolocation(city, api_key)\n    daily_data = get_weather_data(lat, lon, api_key)\n    avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure = calculate_averages(daily_data)\n    generate_pdf_report(city, avg_temp, avg_humidity, avg_pressure)\n    print(\"Weather report generated and saved as 'weather_report.pdf'\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading API Key**: The API key is read from a file named `api_key.txt` for security reasons.\n2. **Fetching Geolocation**: Uses OpenWeatherMap's geocoding API to get latitude and longitude for the given city.\n3. **Fetching Weather Data**: Uses OpenWeatherMap's One Call API to get daily weather data for the next 7 days.\n4. **Calculating Averages**: Computes average temperature, humidity, and pressure over the 7-day period.\n5. **Generating PDF Report**: Uses ReportLab to create a PDF report containing the calculated averages.\n\nThis script ensures all operations are handled gracefully, with appropriate error messages for issues like invalid city names or API request failures."
