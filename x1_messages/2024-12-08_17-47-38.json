        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from City A to City B at 50 mph and it takes 4 hours. Then it comes back from City B to City A at 70 mph, and I need to find out how long that takes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the distance between City A and City B. Since it's going at 50 mph for 4 hours, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, Distance from A to B = 50 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 200 miles.\n\nNow, for the return trip, it's traveling at 70 mph, and I need to find the time it takes to cover the same 200 miles.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\n\nSo, Time from B to A = 200 miles \u00f7 70 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n200 \u00f7 70 is approximately 2.857 hours.\n\nBut I think it's better to express it in hours and minutes. So, 0.857 hours is roughly 0.857 \u00d7 60 minutes, which is about 51.4 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time for the return trip is approximately 2 hours and 51 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if that makes sense. Let's see, 70 mph means it covers 70 miles every hour. In 2 hours, it would cover 140 miles, and then it has 60 miles left to cover. At 70 mph, the time to cover 60 miles is 60 \u00f7 70 = approximately 0.857 hours, which is about 51.4 minutes. So, yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula directly:\n\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed = 200 \u00f7 70 = approximately 2.857 hours, which is 2 hours and 51 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours and } 51 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
