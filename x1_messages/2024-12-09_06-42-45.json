        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Python script that uses Memcached for caching key-value pairs. Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, and it's great for speeding up web applications by reducing database load.\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to make sure Memcached is installed and running on your system. You can download it from the official Memcached website or install it via package managers like apt or yum, depending on your operating system.\n\nOnce Memcached is set up, you'll need a Python client to interact with it. The most popular one is `python-memcached`, but there are others like `pymemcache` and `bmemcached`. For this script, I'll use `python-memcached` because it's straightforward and widely used.\n\nYou can install `python-memcached` using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install python-memcached\n```\n\nNow, let's outline what our script needs to do:\n\n1. **Set a value:** Store a key-value pair in Memcached.\n2. **Get a value:** Retrieve a value from Memcached using a key.\n3. **Delete a value:** Remove a key-value pair from Memcached.\n\nWe'll create a simple command-line interface where the user can choose which operation to perform and provide the necessary inputs.\n\nHere's a basic structure of how the script might look:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom memcache import Client\n\ndef set_value(client, key, value):\n    client.set(key, value)\n    print(f\"Value set for key: {key}\")\n\ndef get_value(client, key):\n    value = client.get(key)\n    if value is not None:\n        print(f\"Value for key '{key}': {value}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No value found for key: {key}\")\n\ndef delete_value(client, key):\n    client.delete(key)\n    print(f\"Key '{key}' deleted\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Assuming Memcached is running on localhost at port 11211\n    client = Client(['127.0.0.1:11211'], debug=0)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nMemcached Operations:\")\n        print(\"1. Set a value\")\n        print(\"2. Get a value\")\n        print(\"3. Delete a value\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1-4): \")\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n            value = input(\"Enter value: \")\n            set_value(client, key, value)\n        elif choice == '2':\n            key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n            get_value(client, key)\n        elif choice == '3':\n            key = input(\"Enter key: \")\n            delete_value(client, key)\n        elif choice == '4':\n            print(\"Exiting...\")\n            sys.exit()\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Setting up Memcached client:**\n   - We use the `Client` class from the `memcache` module to connect to the Memcached server running on localhost at port 11211.\n\n2. **Set a value:**\n   - The `set_value` function takes the client, key, and value as arguments and uses the `set` method to store the key-value pair in Memcached.\n\n3. **Get a value:**\n   - The `get_value` function retrieves the value associated with a given key using the `get` method. If the key exists, it prints the value; otherwise, it indicates that no value was found.\n\n4. **Delete a value:**\n   - The `delete_value` function removes the key-value pair from Memcached using the `delete` method.\n\n5. **Main function:**\n   - A loop presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose between setting, getting, deleting a value, or exiting the script.\n   - Based on the user's choice, it prompts for the necessary inputs and calls the corresponding functions.\n\nThis script provides a simple interface to perform basic Memcached operations. You can expand upon this by adding error handling, supporting expiration times for keys, or handling multiple Memcached servers for a distributed setup.\n\nRemember to adjust the Memcached server address and port in the `Client` initialization if your Memcached instance is running on a different host or port.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with using Memcached in your Python applications!
