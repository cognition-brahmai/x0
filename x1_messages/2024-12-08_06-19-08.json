        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 100 houses in a town, and every single one has at least one pet. Out of these, 50 houses have dogs and 60 have cats. I need to find out how many houses have both dogs and cats. Hmm, this seems like a classic problem in set theory, specifically dealing with overlapping sets.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. I think a Venn diagram would be helpful here. Imagine two circles overlapping: one circle represents houses with dogs, and the other represents houses with cats. The overlapping area would represent houses that have both dogs and cats.\n\nSo, if I let:\n\n- D be the set of houses with dogs,\n\n- C be the set of houses with cats,\n\n- And let\u2019s say B is the number of houses that have both dogs and cats.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- The total number of houses with dogs, which is the size of set D, is 50.\n\n- The total number of houses with cats, which is the size of set C, is 60.\n\n- The total number of houses is 100, and every house has at least one pet.\n\nIn set theory, the principle of inclusion-exclusion comes to mind. It states that the size of the union of two sets is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. In formula terms:\n\n|D \u222a C| = |D| + |C| - |D \u2229 C|\n\nIn this context:\n\n- |D \u222a C| is the total number of houses with either dogs or cats or both.\n\n- |D| is 50.\n\n- |C| is 60.\n\n- |D \u2229 C| is B, the number of houses with both.\n\nWe also know that every house has at least one pet, so |D \u222a C| equals 100.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n100 = 50 + 60 - B\n\nSo, 100 = 110 - B\n\nNow, solving for B:\n\nB = 110 - 100\n\nB = 10\n\nTherefore, 10 houses have both dogs and cats.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If there are 50 houses with dogs and 60 with cats, and 10 have both, then the number of houses with only dogs would be 50 - 10 = 40, and the number with only cats would be 60 - 10 = 50. Adding those up: 40 (only dogs) + 50 (only cats) + 10 (both) = 100, which matches the total number of houses.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let x be the number of houses with both dogs and cats.\n\nThen:\n\n- Houses with only dogs: 50 - x\n\n- Houses with only cats: 60 - x\n\n- Houses with both: x\n\nAnd the sum of these should be equal to the total number of houses, which is 100.\n\nSo:\n\n(50 - x) + (60 - x) + x = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n\n50 - x + 60 - x + x = 100\n\n110 - x = 100\n\nSo, x = 10\n\nAgain, confirming that 10 houses have both dogs and cats.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities or other set theory concepts?\n\nWell, since we're dealing with counts of houses and pets, set theory seems appropriately suited. Probabilities might complicate things unnecessarily here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there could be houses with other types of pets. The problem states that every house has at least one pet, and specifically mentions dogs and cats. It doesn't specify if there are houses with other pets besides dogs and cats.\n\nWait a second, the problem says every house has at least one pet, and then specifies that 50 have dogs and 60 have cats. But it doesn't say that these are the only types of pets. However, since it doesn't mention any other pets, I think it's safe to assume that the only pets are dogs and cats for the purpose of this problem.\n\nIf there were other pets, the problem would probably provide additional information. Since it doesn't, I'll stick with the assumption that pets are only dogs and cats in this town.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that 10 houses have both dogs and cats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
