        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a train travels from Town A to Town B at a constant speed, covering a distance of 120 miles in 2 hours. I need to find its average speed during the trip.\n\nFirst, I should recall the basic formula for speed. I think speed is equal to distance divided by time. So, speed equals distance divided by time.\n\nGiven that the distance is 120 miles and the time is 2 hours, I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nSo, speed = 120 miles / 2 hours.\n\nNow, doing the division, 120 divided by 2 is 60.\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the train is 60 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there anything else I need to consider? The problem says the train travels at a constant speed, which means that its speed doesn't change during the trip. So, the average speed should be the same as its constant speed.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The average speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
