The city you're thinking of is probably Istanbul, which spans both sides of the Bosphorus Strait, effectively linking Europe and Asia. Istanbul has a rich history and has been known by various names throughout its long existence, including Byzantium and Constantinople. So, the isthmus you're asking about is likely the one where Istanbul is located, connecting these two major continents."
