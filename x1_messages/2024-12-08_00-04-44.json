        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company has 500 employees, and 60% of them have children. Out of those who have children, 40% have more than 2 children. I need to find out how many employees have more than 2 children.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many employees have children. Since 60% of the 500 employees have children, I can calculate that by multiplying 500 by 60%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky sometimes. I remember that to convert a percentage to a decimal, I divide by 100. So 60% is equal to 0.60.\n\nSo, number of employees with children = 500 * 0.60.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 500 times 0.60 is 300. So, 300 employees have children.\n\nNow, out of these 300 employees who have children, 40% have more than 2 children. Again, I need to find 40% of 300.\n\nSimilarly, 40% as a decimal is 0.40.\n\nSo, number of employees with more than 2 children = 300 * 0.40.\n\nCalculating that, 300 times 0.40 is 120.\n\nTherefore, 120 employees have more than 2 children.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of employees is 500. 60% of them have children, which is 300 employees. Then, 40% of these 300 have more than 2 children, which is 120 employees.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this problem to confirm my answer?\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of fractions. 60% is the same as 3/5, since 60 divided by 100 is 3/5. So, 3/5 of 500 is (3/5)*500 = 300, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSimilarly, 40% is the same as 2/5. So, 2/5 of 300 is (2/5)*300 = 120, which again matches my previous calculation.\n\nOkay, that gives me more confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire problem in one step. What percentage of the total employees have more than 2 children?\n\nWell, 60% have children, and of those, 40% have more than 2 children. So, the percentage of employees with more than 2 children is 60% times 40%.\n\nLet me calculate that: 60% * 40% = 0.60 * 0.40 = 0.24, which is 24%.\n\nSo, 24% of the total employees have more than 2 children.\n\nNow, 24% of 500 is 0.24 * 500 = 120, which again confirms my earlier answer.\n\nHmm, it's good to see that all these different approaches lead me to the same number, 120.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem that could change this result.\n\nFor example, maybe some employees have exactly 2 children, and some have more than 2. But the problem specifically says \"more than 2 children,\" so I think I've answered the question correctly.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no rounding issues or anything like that. But since the numbers are nice and round, I don't think rounding is an issue here.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the number of employees who have more than 2 children is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
