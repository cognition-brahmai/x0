        "content": "In the realms where light and shadow dance,\nWhere forests deep and mountains grand do prance,\nThere dwell the beings of myth and lore,\nUnicorns, with horns of gold and hair of silver o'er.\n\nIn fields of emerald green they roam,\nTheir hooves leave trails like stars that glow and roam,\nThrough glades where flowers bloom with magic's touch,\nThey wander free, in nature's hush.\n\nTheir eyes, like sapphires shining bright,\nHold secrets of the night,\nTheir presence brings a sense of peace,\nIn lands where darkness does release.\n\nIn ancient tales, their horns are said,\nTo heal the wounded, the sick, the dead,\nA potion from the horn's pure grace,\nCan cure all ills, erase life's base.\n\nYet, elusive are these creatures fair,\nFew have seen them, few can dare,\nTo glimpse their beauty, their ethereal might,\nIs a gift from the gods, a wondrous sight.\n\nSo sing we now, this ballad old,\nOf unicorns, in tales untold,\nMay their grace and purity endure,\nIn hearts that cherish, in dreams that lure.\n\nFor in a world so oft entwined,\nWith strife and sorrow, left behind,\nThe unicorn stands, a symbol pure,\nOf hope and love, forever sure.\n\nThus let us hold, in memory's keep,\nThe legend of the unicorn, so free,\nMay their spirit guide us through the night,\nTo where the morning sun takes flight.\n\n**End of Ballad**"
