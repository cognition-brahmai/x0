        "content": "Let's see. So, the store is offering a discount where customers pay only 70% of the original price, and the discounted price is $84. I need to find out what the original price was.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means to pay 70% of the original price. If the original price is, let's say, 100%, then the discounted price is 70% of that. So, if I have the discounted price and I know it's 70% of the original, I can set up an equation to find the original price.\n\nLet me denote the original price as \"x.\" So, 70% of x is equal to $84. In mathematical terms, that would be:\n\n0.70 * x = 84\n\nNow, I need to solve for x to find the original price. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.70.\n\nx = 84 / 0.70\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n84 divided by 0.70.\n\nWell, 0.70 is the same as 7/10, so dividing by 0.70 is the same as multiplying by 10/7.\n\nSo, x = 84 * (10/7)\n\nFirst, 84 divided by 7 is 12, and then 12 multiplied by 10 is 120.\n\nTherefore, the original price was $120.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf the original price is $120 and the discount is 30%, then the customer pays 70% of $120, which is 0.70 * 120 = 84. Yes, that matches the given discounted price.\n\nSo, the original price was indeed $120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
