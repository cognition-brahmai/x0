It sounds like you want to create a program that takes two addresses from the user, uses the Google Maps API to calculate the distance between them, and then displays that distance in both miles and kilometers. That's a great project to work on, and I can guide you through the process.\n\nFirst, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the official Python website. Make sure to choose the version that matches your operating system.\n\nNext, you'll need to get an API key from Google Cloud Platform to access the Google Maps API. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Platform website and create a new project.\n2. Enable the Google Maps API for your project.\n3. Create an API key, which will be used to authenticate your requests.\n\nOnce you have your API key, you can start writing your Python code. You'll need to use the `requests` module to make HTTP requests to the Google Maps API. If you don't have the `requests` module installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nNow, let's outline the steps for your program:\n\n1. Prompt the user to enter the first address.\n2. Prompt the user to enter the second address.\n3. Use the Google Maps Geocoding API to convert both addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates.\n4. Use the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to calculate the distance between the two sets of coordinates.\n5. Convert the distance from meters to miles and kilometers.\n6. Display the results to the user.\n\nI'll help you with each of these steps. Let's start by writing the code to get user input for the two addresses.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python program that calculates the distance between two addresses using the Google Maps API, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python is installed on your computer. If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Google Cloud Platform API Key**:\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n   - Create a new project.\n   - Enable the Google Maps Geocoding API and Distance Matrix API for your project.\n   - Generate an API key.\n\n3. **Requests Module**: Install the `requests` module if not already installed.\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_coordinates(address, api_key):\n    \"\"\"Get coordinates (lat, lng) for a given address.\"\"\"\n    base_url = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json\"\n    params = {\n        'address': address,\n        'key': api_key\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n    if data['status'] == 'OK':\n        result = data['results'][0]\n        geometry = result['geometry']['location']\n        return geometry['lat'], geometry['lng']\n    else:\n        print(f\"Geocoding failed: {data['status']}\")\n        return None\n\ndef get_distance(origin, destination, api_key):\n    \"\"\"Get distance between two coordinates using Distance Matrix API.\"\"\"\n    base_url = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json\"\n    params = {\n        'origins': f\"{origin[0]},{origin[1]}\",\n        'destinations': f\"{destination[0]},{destination[1]}\",\n        'key': api_key\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n    if data['status'] == 'OK':\n        try:\n            element = data['rows'][0]['elements'][0]\n            if element['status'] == 'OK':\n                distance = element['distance']['value']  # in meters\n                return distance\n            else:\n                print(f\"Distance Matrix API error: {element['status']}\")\n                return None\n        except IndexError:\n            print(\"Error in Distance Matrix API response.\")\n            return None\n    else:\n        print(f\"Distance Matrix API failed: {data['status']}\")\n        return None\n\ndef convert_meters_to_units(distance_meters):\n    \"\"\"Convert meters to miles and kilometers.\"\"\"\n    miles = distance_meters * 0.000621371\n    kilometers = distance_meters * 0.001\n    return miles, kilometers\n\ndef main():\n    api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    address1 = input(\"Enter the first address: \")\n    address2 = input(\"Enter the second address: \")\n\n    origin_coords = get_coordinates(address1, api_key)\n    if not origin_coords:\n        return\n\n    destination_coords = get_coordinates(address2, api_key)\n    if not destination_coords:\n        return\n\n    distance_meters = get_distance(origin_coords, destination_coords, api_key)\n    if not distance_meters:\n        return\n\n    miles, kilometers = convert_meters_to_units(distance_meters)\n\n    print(f\"Distance: {miles:.2f} miles or {kilometers:.2f} kilometers\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Get Coordinates**:\n   - Use the Geocoding API to convert addresses to latitude and longitude.\n\n2. **Calculate Distance**:\n   - Use the Distance Matrix API to find the distance between two sets of coordinates.\n\n3. **Convert Units**:\n   - Convert the distance from meters to miles and kilometers.\n\n4. **User Input and Output**:\n   - Prompt the user for two addresses.\n   - Display the calculated distance in both miles and kilometers.\n\nReplace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Google Maps API key. This program handles basic error checking for API responses but can be extended for more robust error handling and edge cases."
