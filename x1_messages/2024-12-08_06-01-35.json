        "content": "Let's see. The algorithm described here sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It keeps doing this until no more swaps are needed, which means the array is sorted. And it has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of items.\n\nI need to figure out which sorting algorithm this is among the options: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort.\n\nFirst, let's recall how each of these algorithms works.\n\nQuick Sort: It's a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. Then, it recursively sorts the sub-arrays. Its average time complexity is O(n log n), but in the worst case, it can be O(n^2).\n\nMerge Sort: It's also a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. Its time complexity is O(n log n) in all cases.\n\nBubble Sort: This one works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted. Yes, that sounds a lot like the description I was given.\n\nInsertion Sort: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, it has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the average and worst cases, but it's more efficient for small data sets and mostly sorted lists.\n\nSo, based on the description:\n\n- It sorts by swapping adjacent elements.\n\n- It repeats this until no more swaps are needed.\n\n- Time complexity is O(n^2).\n\nThat matches Bubble Sort.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nQuick Sort: Doesn't involve swapping adjacent elements; it partitions the array based on a pivot.\n\nMerge Sort: Doesn't swap elements; it divides the array and merges sorted subarrays.\n\nInsertion Sort: Inserts elements into their correct position in a sorted sublist, which is different from swapping adjacent elements.\n\nSo, yes, it seems like Bubble Sort is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Bubble Sort}} \\]"
