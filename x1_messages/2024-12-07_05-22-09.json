        "content": "So I've got this probability question here. It's about drawing two aces from a standard deck of playing cards without replacing the first card. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what's in a standard deck. There are 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K.\n\nNow, the question is about drawing two aces without replacement. That means once I draw the first card, I don't put it back into the deck before drawing the second card.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many aces are in the deck. Since each suit has one ace, and there are four suits, there are 4 aces in total.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two aces in a row without replacement is the probability of drawing an ace first and then another ace second.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of the first card being an ace. There are 4 aces out of 52 cards, so the probability is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13.\n\nNow, given that the first card was an ace, there are now 3 aces left in the deck, and the deck now has 51 cards since we didn't replace the first card.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a second ace is 3/51, which simplifies to 1/17.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening (drawing an ace first AND drawing an ace second), I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the overall probability is (1/13) * (1/17).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(1/13) * (1/17) = 1/221.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two aces without replacement is 1/221.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 aces out of 4 aces is C(4,2), and the number of ways to choose any 2 cards out of 52 cards is C(52,2).\n\nSo, the probability is C(4,2) / C(52,2).\n\nLet's calculate C(4,2) and C(52,2).\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo, C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4*3*2*1) / (2*1 * 2*1) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nC(52,2) = 52! / (2! * 50!) = (52*51*50!) / (2*1 * 50!)) = (52*51) / 2 = 2652 / 2 = 1326.\n\nSo, the probability is 6 / 1326, which simplifies to 1/221.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the probability is indeed 1/221.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Suppose I consider the positions of the cards. But I think the two methods I've used cover it pretty well.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the decimal equivalent of 1/221 to get a sense of how likely this is.\n\n1 divided by 221 is approximately 0.00452, or 0.452%.\n\nSo, it's a pretty low probability, which makes sense because aces are rare in the deck.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider? Oh, maybe whether the order matters. In this case, since we're drawing two cards without replacement, and the problem just says \"drawing two aces,\" the order doesn't matter. Whether I draw an ace first and then another ace or vice versa, it's still two aces.\n\nWait, in this specific problem, since we're drawing two cards in sequence without replacement, the order does matter in the way I calculated it, because I considered first drawing an ace and then another ace.\n\nBut in the combination method, order doesn't matter, which is why it's a combination rather than a permutation.\n\nBut since both methods gave me the same answer, I think it's correct.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that could affect the probability, like the suits of the cards or anything else. But no, in a standard deck, all aces are equally likely to be drawn, regardless of their suit.\n\nAlso, since we're not replacing the first card, the second draw is dependent on the first, which is properly accounted for in the calculation.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The probability of drawing two aces without replacement from a standard deck of 52 cards is 1/221.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{221}} \\]"
