        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system by adding new buses and extending routes. Currently, there are 100 buses, each with a capacity of 50 passengers. They want to increase the total passenger capacity by 20% while maintaining an average occupancy rate of 80%. We need to find out how many additional buses are needed and estimate the cost, considering each bus costs $300,000. Also, each extended route will require an additional driver at an annual salary of $40,000.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. The city wants to increase the total passenger capacity by 20%. Passenger capacity refers to the maximum number of passengers that the bus system can carry at any given time. So, with 100 buses, each holding 50 passengers, the current total capacity is 100 * 50 = 5,000 passengers.\n\nIncreasing this by 20% means they want an additional 20% of 5,000 passengers. So, 20% of 5,000 is 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000 passengers. Therefore, the new total capacity should be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 passengers.\n\nNow, each new bus also has a capacity of 50 passengers. To find out how many additional buses are needed to reach the new total capacity, we can divide the additional capacity needed by the capacity of each bus.\n\nAdditional buses needed = additional capacity / capacity per bus = 1,000 / 50 = 20 buses.\n\nSo, the city needs to add 20 buses to their fleet.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the cost of these additional buses. Each bus costs $300,000, so the total cost for 20 buses would be 20 * $300,000 = $6,000,000.\n\nAdditionally, each extended route will require an additional driver at an annual salary of $40,000. However, the problem doesn't specify how many extended routes there will be. It only says that each extended route requires an additional driver.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because we don't know how many routes are being extended. Perhaps each new bus is assigned to a new route, or maybe existing buses are being reassigned. Without specific information on the number of extended routes, we can't accurately calculate the additional driver costs.\n\nBut for the sake of providing a comprehensive estimate, maybe we can assume that each new bus is assigned to a new route, thus requiring a new driver.\n\nSo, if 20 new buses are added, and each requires a new driver, then the additional annual salary cost would be 20 * $40,000 = $800,000 per year.\n\nTherefore, the one-time cost for the buses is $6,000,000, and the ongoing annual cost for drivers is $800,000.\n\nHowever, this is based on the assumption that each new bus requires a new driver. If the city can redistribute drivers among existing and new routes, the number of new drivers needed might be less.\n\nBut with the information provided, assuming one new driver per new bus seems reasonable.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Additional buses needed: 20\n\n- One-time cost for buses: $6,000,000\n\n- Additional annual driver salaries: $800,000\n\nWait a minute, but the problem also mentions maintaining an average occupancy rate of 80%. Does this affect our calculations?\n\nLet's think about it. Occupancy rate is the percentage of seats that are filled. So, if the average occupancy is 80%, that means on average, each bus has 80% of its seats occupied.\n\nBut in our earlier calculations, we were focusing on capacity, which is the maximum number of passengers the system can carry.\n\nThe occupancy rate might be relevant if we were looking at the number of passengers being carried currently and how that changes with the addition of new buses.\n\nBut in this case, the city's goal is to increase the total passenger capacity by 20%, regardless of the occupancy rate.\n\nSo, I think the occupancy rate is more about how full the buses are, but the capacity is about how many passengers they can carry when full.\n\nTherefore, for the purpose of calculating the number of additional buses needed to increase capacity by 20%, the occupancy rate doesn't directly affect the calculation.\n\nHowever, it might be relevant for other aspects, like determining if the increased capacity is necessary based on demand, but that's not part of the question.\n\nSo, I believe our earlier calculation stands.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's verify the steps again.\n\n1. Current fleet: 100 buses, each with 50 passengers capacity.\n\n2. Current total capacity: 100 * 50 = 5,000 passengers.\n\n3. Desired increase in capacity: 20% of 5,000 = 1,000 passengers.\n\n4. New total capacity: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 passengers.\n\n5. Each new bus adds 50 passengers capacity.\n\n6. Additional buses needed: 1,000 / 50 = 20 buses.\n\n7. Cost per bus: $300,000.\n\n8. Total one-time cost: 20 * $300,000 = $6,000,000.\n\n9. Each extended route requires one additional driver at $40,000 per year.\n\n10. Assuming one new route per new bus, additional drivers needed: 20.\n\n11. Additional annual driver salaries: 20 * $40,000 = $800,000.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the city can optimize routes and have more than one bus per route, then the number of new drivers might be less than the number of new buses.\n\nBut again, without specific information on route structure, it's reasonable to assume one driver per new bus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the city needs to add 20 buses, with a one-time cost of $6,000,000 and additional annual driver salaries of $800,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20 \\text{ buses, } \\$6,000,000 \\text{ one-time cost, } \\$800,000 \\text{ annual driver salaries}} \\]"
