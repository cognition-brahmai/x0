        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 200 cars in total. On weekdays, they rent out 75% of their cars, and on weekends, they rent out 90% of their cars. I need to find out how many more cars are rented out on weekends compared to weekdays.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many cars are rented on weekdays. Since they rent out 75% of their cars on weekdays, I can find that by multiplying 200 by 75%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky. I remember that 75% is the same as 75/100 or 0.75 in decimal form. So, to find 75% of 200, I can multiply 200 by 0.75.\n\nLet me do that: 200 times 0.75. 200 times 0.7 is 140, and 200 times 0.05 is 10, so total 150 cars are rented on weekdays.\n\nNow, for weekends, they rent out 90% of their cars. Again, 90% is 90/100 or 0.90 in decimal form. So, 200 times 0.90 should give me the number of cars rented on weekends.\n\n200 times 0.90 is 180 cars.\n\nNow, to find out how many more cars are rented on weekends compared to weekdays, I need to subtract the number of cars rented on weekdays from the number rented on weekends.\n\nSo, 180 minus 150 equals 30.\n\nTherefore, 30 more cars are rented out on weekends compared to weekdays.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I might have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nStarting again: 75% of 200 is 150, and 90% of 200 is 180. The difference between 180 and 150 is indeed 30.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage difference. The difference in rental rates is 90% minus 75%, which is 15%. So, 15% of 200 should give me the same answer.\n\nLet's calculate 15% of 200. 15% is 0.15 in decimal form, so 200 times 0.15 is 30.\n\nSame answer as before, which reinforces that 30 is the correct difference.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for each percent point difference, there are 200 divided by 100, which is 2 cars per percentage point.\n\nThe difference is 15 percentage points, so 15 times 2 equals 30 cars.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: 30 more cars are rented out on weekends compared to weekdays.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. The key is to correctly convert the percentages to decimals and perform the multiplications accurately.\n\nIt's also important to make sure that the fleet size remains constant at 200 cars, and that there are no other variables affecting the number of cars rented out on different days.\n\nAssuming that the rental rates are exactly 75% on weekdays and 90% on weekends, and that the fleet size doesn't change, then 30 is the correct difference.\n\nI don't see any other factors that could influence this calculation based on the information provided.\n\nSo, the final answer is 30 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
