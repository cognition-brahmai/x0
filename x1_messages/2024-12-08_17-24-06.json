Tulips are also strongly associated with the Netherlands, as they were introduced there in the 16th century and have since become a symbol of the country. Wooden shoes, or \"klompen,\" are another traditional item, although they're more commonly worn in rural areas nowadays. Lastly, the Netherlands has an extensive system of dikes and canals to manage its low-lying land and protect against flooding."
