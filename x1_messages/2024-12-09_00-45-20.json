        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a father who is 40 years old and a son who is 10 years old. We need to find out in how many years the father will be twice as old as his son.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables. Let\u2019s say the number of years we\u2019re trying to find is \\( x \\). So, in \\( x \\) years, the father will be \\( 40 + x \\) years old, and the son will be \\( 10 + x \\) years old.\n\nNow, according to the problem, at that time, the father\u2019s age will be twice the son\u2019s age. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 40 + x = 2(10 + x) \\]\n\nLet\u2019s solve for \\( x \\):\n\nFirst, expand the right side:\n\n\\[ 40 + x = 20 + 2x \\]\n\nNow, let\u2019s move all the \\( x \\)-terms to one side and the constants to the other side. Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 40 = 20 + x \\]\n\nThen, subtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 20 = x \\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 20 \\).\n\nLet\u2019s check if this makes sense. In 20 years, the father will be \\( 40 + 20 = 60 \\) years old, and the son will be \\( 10 + 20 = 30 \\) years old. Is 60 twice 30? Yes, because \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\).\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let\u2019s see if there\u2019s another way to think about it. Maybe there\u2019s a different approach or a formula we could use.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the age difference between the father and the son. The age difference is always constant. So, the father is always 30 years older than the son because \\( 40 - 10 = 30 \\).\n\nWe want the father\u2019s age to be twice the son\u2019s age. So, if the son\u2019s age is \\( s \\), then the father\u2019s age would be \\( 2s \\). But we also know that the father is always 30 years older than the son. So, we can write:\n\n\\[ 2s = s + 30 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ 2s - s = 30 \\]\\[ s = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the son will be 30 years old when the father is twice his age. Since the son is currently 10 years old, that means it will take \\( 30 - 10 = 20 \\) years.\n\nThis matches our previous answer, which is a good sign.\n\nLet\u2019s try another approach to be thorough. Suppose we use the concept of relative ages or ratios. Currently, the father is 40 and the son is 10, so the ratio is \\( 40:10 = 4:1 \\). We want the ratio to be \\( 2:1 \\).\n\nThe ratio needs to change from 4:1 to 2:1. The difference between these ratios is that the father\u2019s age relative to the son\u2019s age decreases from 4 times to 2 times. The son needs to age in such a way that the father\u2019s age is only twice his.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of their ages increasing at the same rate. Each year, both the father and the son get one year older. So, the difference in their ages remains constant at 30 years.\n\nWe can set up the equation based on the father\u2019s age being twice the son\u2019s age:\n\n\\[ \\text{father\u2019s age} = 2 \\times \\text{son\u2019s age} \\]\n\nGiven that the father is always 30 years older, we can substitute:\n\n\\[ 2s = s + 30 \\]\n\nWhich again gives us \\( s = 30 \\), meaning the son will be 30 years old when this happens.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the general formula for their ages in \\( x \\) years:\n\nFather\u2019s age: \\( 40 + x \\)\n\nSon\u2019s age: \\( 10 + x \\)\n\nSet the father\u2019s age equal to twice the son\u2019s age:\n\n\\[ 40 + x = 2(10 + x) \\]\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way we approach this, we keep arriving at \\( x = 20 \\) years.\n\nLet\u2019s consider if there\u2019s any other interpretation of the problem. For example, maybe the problem is asking for the number of years until the father is twice as old as the son will be at that time, considering future ages.\n\nBut in this case, the problem is pretty straightforward: \u201cin how many years will the father be twice as old as his son?\u201d So, our initial approach should suffice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if there\u2019s a possibility that the father could be twice as old as the son at some point in the past.\n\nIf we consider negative values of \\( x \\), meaning years ago, then:\n\nFather\u2019s age: \\( 40 + x \\), where \\( x \\) is negative.\n\nSon\u2019s age: \\( 10 + x \\), where \\( x \\) is negative.\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n\\[ 40 + x = 2(10 + x) \\]\n\n\\[ 40 + x = 20 + 2x \\]\n\n\\[ 40 - 20 = 2x - x \\]\n\n\\[ 20 = x \\]\n\nStill, \\( x = 20 \\), which corresponds to future years, not past years. If we plug in a negative \\( x \\), say \\( x = -10 \\):\n\nFather\u2019s age: \\( 40 - 10 = 30 \\)\n\nSon\u2019s age: \\( 10 - 10 = 0 \\)\n\nIs 30 twice 0? No, that doesn\u2019t make sense. So, negative \\( x \\) doesn\u2019t apply here.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\( x = 20 \\) years into the future.\n\nTo double-check, let\u2019s consider another example. Suppose the father is 30 years old and the son is 5 years old. In how many years will the father be twice as old as the son?\n\nUsing the same approach:\n\nFather\u2019s age in \\( x \\) years: \\( 30 + x \\)\n\nSon\u2019s age in \\( x \\) years: \\( 5 + x \\)\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n\\[ 30 + x = 2(5 + x) \\]\n\n\\[ 30 + x = 10 + 2x \\]\n\n\\[ 30 - 10 = 2x - x \\]\n\n\\[ 20 = x \\]\n\nSo, in 20 years, the father will be 50 and the son will be 25, which is indeed twice the son\u2019s age.\n\nThis similar example confirms our method.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the father will be twice as old as his son in 20 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
