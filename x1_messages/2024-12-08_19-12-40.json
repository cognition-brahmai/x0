        "content": "So the baker uses 2 eggs for each cake, and he wants to bake 30 cakes. I need to find out how many dozens of eggs he needs. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of eggs required for 30 cakes. Since each cake requires 2 eggs, I can multiply the number of cakes by the number of eggs per cake:\n\nTotal eggs = Number of cakes \u00d7 Eggs per cake\nTotal eggs = 30 \u00d7 2\nTotal eggs = 60\n\nSo, the baker needs 60 eggs in total.\n\nNext, I need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. I know that one dozen equals 12 items. Therefore, to find out how many dozens are in 60 eggs, I can divide the total number of eggs by 12:\n\nDozens of eggs = Total eggs \u00f7 12\nDozens of eggs = 60 \u00f7 12\nDozens of eggs = 5\n\nTherefore, the baker needs 5 dozens of eggs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If one dozen is 12 eggs, then 5 dozens would be:\n\n5 \u00d7 12 = 60 eggs\n\nYes, that matches the total number of eggs needed. So, my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to think about it differently, I can consider how many eggs are needed per dozen of cakes. But that might complicate things unnecessary. Stick with the straightforward approach.\n\nSo, in summary, the baker needs 5 dozens of eggs to bake 30 cakes, using 2 eggs per cake.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
