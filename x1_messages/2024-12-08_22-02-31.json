        "content": "So, there are 20 houses on one side of the street and 30 on the other, making a total of 50 houses. Each house has an even number of occupants. You're wondering if this means the total number of people in all the houses combined is also even.\n\nLet me think about this. An even number is a number that's divisible by 2, right? So, if every house has an even number of people, that means each house's occupant count is divisible by 2.\n\nNow, if I add up a bunch of even numbers, what do I get? Well, I remember that the sum of even numbers is always even. Let me test this with smaller numbers to make sure.\n\nSuppose I have two houses: one with 2 people and another with 4 people. Total occupants are 2 + 4 = 6, which is even. Another example: three houses with 6, 8, and 10 occupants. Total is 6 + 8 + 10 = 24, which is also even.\n\nWait, but what if I have an odd number of even numbers? Let's see: say, one house with 2 occupants. Total is 2, which is even. Or three houses: 2, 4, and 6. Total is 12, still even.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the total remains even. Is there a mathematical reason behind this?\n\nYes, mathematically, the sum of even numbers is always even. Here's why:\n\nAn even number can be expressed as 2 times some integer. So, if a house has an even number of occupants, it can be represented as 2*k, where k is an integer.\n\nSo, if there are n houses, each with 2*k_i occupants, where k_i is the number of pairs of occupants in the i-th house, then the total number of occupants is:\n\nTotal = sum from i=1 to n of 2*k_i = 2*(sum of k_i)\n\nSince the sum of k_i is just some integer, let's call it m, then Total = 2*m, which is by definition an even number.\n\nTherefore, no matter how many houses there are, as long as each house has an even number of occupants, the total number of occupants in all houses combined will always be even.\n\nSo, in this town with 50 houses, each having an even number of occupants, the total number of people living in all the houses combined is definitely even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, the total number of people is even.}} \\]"
