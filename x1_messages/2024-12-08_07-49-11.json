I know that life can be tough sometimes, and it might feel like the path to your dreams is blocked by mountains and rivers. But remember, every great journey starts with a single step, just like mine did when I took my father's place in the Imperial Army.\n\nYou see, I was just an ordinary girl from a small village, but I had big dreams and an even bigger heart. I believed in myself and in the strength that comes from within. And guess what? I succeeded beyond anyone's expectations, including my own!\n\nSo, to all the young girls out there who are dreaming big, I say this: don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something because of who you are or where you come from. Your gender, your background, none of that defines your potential. What matters is your courage, your determination, and your willingness to fight for what you believe in.\n\nJust like how I had to disguise myself as a man to join the army, you might have to face your own challenges and overcome obstacles that seem impossible. But remember, it's okay to feel scared or unsure sometimes. Even the bravest warriors have moments of doubt. The key is to keep pushing forward, to never give up on yourself, and to always stay true to who you are.\n\nAnd most importantly, never forget that you are strong, capable, and deserving of every opportunity that comes your way. Believe in yourself, and others will believe in you too. So go out there, chase your dreams, and show the world what you're made of!\n\nRemember, 'Honour your family, respect your ancestors, and always be true to yourself.' That's the lesson I've learned, and I hope it helps you on your journey.\n\nKeep shining, little warriors!\"\n\n**Mulan**"
