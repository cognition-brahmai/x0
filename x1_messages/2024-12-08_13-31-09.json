        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, the father and his son share the same birthday, which means they're both celebrating today. Interesting. And today, the father's age is exactly twice the son's age. So, if I let the son's age be S, then the father's age is 2S. Got it.\n\nNow, in 10 years, the father will be only 1.5 times older than the son. So, in 10 years, the son will be S + 10, and the father will be 2S + 10. And according to the problem, at that time, the father's age will be 1.5 times the son's age. So, I can set up an equation: 2S + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nAlright, let's solve this equation step by step. First, expand the right side: 1.5(S + 10) = 1.5S + 15.\n\nSo, the equation becomes: 2S + 10 = 1.5S + 15.\n\nNow, I'll subtract 1.5S from both sides: 2S - 1.5S + 10 = 15.\n\nThat simplifies to 0.5S + 10 = 15.\n\nNext, subtract 10 from both sides: 0.5S = 5.\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.5: S = 10.\n\nSo, the son is currently 10 years old. Since the father is twice the son's age, that means the father is 2 * 10 = 20 years old.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too young for a father. Normally, fathers are older than that, but maybe it's possible. But let's check if this satisfies the second condition.\n\nIn 10 years, the son will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old, and the father will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old. Is 30 equal to 1.5 times 20? Well, 1.5 * 20 = 30. Yes, it checks out.\n\nBut somehow, a 20-year-old father seems young. Maybe I did something wrong. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting again: Let son's current age be S, father's age is 2S.\n\nIn 10 years: Son is S + 10, Father is 2S + 10.\n\nGiven that 2S + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nExpand: 2S + 10 = 1.5S + 15.\n\nSubtract 1.5S from both sides: 0.5S + 10 = 15.\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides: 0.5S = 5.\n\nDivide by 0.5: S = 10.\n\nSeems correct. So, the son is 10, the father is 20.\n\nBut to think about it, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using different variables or considering their age difference.\n\nLet me try another approach. The age difference between the father and the son is constant. So, today, the father is twice as old as the son, so the age difference is S.\n\nWait, no. If the father is 2S and the son is S, then the age difference is 2S - S = S.\n\nIn 10 years, the father will be 2S + 10 and the son will be S + 10. According to the problem, at that time, the father is 1.5 times older than the son.\n\nSo, 2S + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nWait, that's the same equation as before. So, it leads to the same result: S = 10, father = 20.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the age difference.\n\nSince the age difference is S, and in 10 years, the father is 1.5 times the son's age.\n\nSo, age difference in 10 years is still S, because age difference doesn't change.\n\nSo, father's age in 10 years is son's age in 10 years plus the age difference: (S + 10) + S = 2S + 10.\n\nBut according to the problem, father's age in 10 years is 1.5 times the son's age in 10 years: 1.5(S + 10).\n\nSo, 2S + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nAgain, the same equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up the equation based on the ratio.\n\nToday, father's age is twice the son's age: F = 2S.\n\nIn 10 years, father's age is 1.5 times the son's age: F + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nSubstitute F from the first equation into the second: 2S + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nAgain, same equation.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that S = 10 and F = 20.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Today, the father's age is exactly twice the son's age. In 10 years, the father will be only 1.5 times older than the son. How old are they today?\"\n\nWait, the phrase \"1.5 times older\" could be ambiguous. Some people might interpret \"times older\" differently.\n\nUsually, \"times older\" means multiplication of the age difference, but in standard mathematical terms, it's better to interpret it as \"1.5 times the son's age.\"\n\nBut perhaps the problem means that the father will be 1.5 times the son's age in addition to the son's age.\n\nWait, that would be: father's age in 10 years = son's age in 10 years + 1.5 * son's age in 10 years = 2.5 * (S + 10).\n\nBut that seems like an alternative interpretation.\n\nIf I consider that, then the equation becomes: 2S + 10 = 2.5(S + 10).\n\nLet's solve that.\n\n2S + 10 = 2.5S + 25.\n\nSubtract 2S from both sides: 10 = 0.5S + 25.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides: -15 = 0.5S.\n\nThen, S = -30.\n\nThat doesn't make sense, as ages can't be negative.\n\nSo, perhaps \"1.5 times older\" should not be interpreted that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1.5 times as old as\"?\n\nIn that case, it would be the same as the first interpretation: F + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nWhich gives S = 10, F = 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that the father will be 1.5 times the son's current age in 10 years.\n\nBut that would be: F + 10 = 1.5S.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the father is already older.\n\nLet's check with S = 10 and F = 20.\n\nIn 10 years, son is 20, father is 30.\n\nIs 30 equal to 1.5 times 20? Yes, because 1.5 * 20 = 30.\n\nSo, it fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the father is twice the son's age today.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the father is twice as old as the son today, but perhaps there's more to it.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the father is twice the son's age plus or minus something.\n\nBut no, the problem clearly states \"exactly twice the son's age.\"\n\nSo, F = 2S today.\n\nAnd in 10 years, F + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nWhich gives S = 10, F = 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo or is poorly worded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that \"1.5 times older\" means something different.\n\nWait, perhaps \"1.5 times as old as\" is different from \"1.5 times older than.\"\n\nIn some contexts, \"times older than\" means multiplication of the difference.\n\nFor example, if A is twice as old as B, then A = 2B.\n\nBut if A is twice older than B, then A = B + 2B = 3B.\n\nWait, that's a common ambiguity.\n\nSo, perhaps in this problem, \"1.5 times older than\" means the father's age in 10 years is the son's age in 10 years plus 1.5 times the son's age in 10 years.\n\nWhich would be: F + 10 = (S + 10) + 1.5(S + 10) = 2.5(S + 10).\n\nThen the equation becomes: 2S + 10 = 2.5(S + 10).\n\nLet's solve that.\n\n2S + 10 = 2.5S + 25.\n\nSubtract 2S from both sides: 10 = 0.5S + 25.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides: -15 = 0.5S.\n\nThen, S = -30.\n\nNegative age doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, perhaps \"1.5 times older than\" should be interpreted as \"1.5 times as old as.\"\n\nTherefore, F + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nWhich gives S = 10, F = 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that in 10 years, the father will be 1.5 times the son's current age.\n\nBut that would be: F + 10 = 1.5S.\n\nBut with F = 2S, that would be 2S + 10 = 1.5S.\n\nThen, 0.5S = -10, S = -20.\n\nAgain, negative age doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake or is poorly worded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that \"today\" the father is twice the son's age, and in 10 years, the father is 1.5 times the son's age at that time.\n\nWhich is what I did initially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to set up the equations differently.\n\nLet me try to set up the equations again.\n\nLet S be the son's current age, F be the father's current age.\n\nGiven:\n\n1) F = 2S (today)\n\n2) F + 10 = 1.5(S + 10) (in 10 years)\n\nSubstitute 1 into 2:\n\n2S + 10 = 1.5(S + 10)\n\nExpand:\n\n2S + 10 = 1.5S + 15\n\nSubtract 1.5S from both sides:\n\n0.5S + 10 = 15\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n0.5S = 5\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nS = 10\n\nThen, F = 2S = 20\n\nSo, son is 10, father is 20.\n\nCheck:\n\nToday: Father is 20, son is 10; 20 is twice 10.\n\nIn 10 years: Father is 30, son is 20; 30 is 1.5 times 20.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nBut, intuitively, a 20-year-old father seems young, but biologically possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the father to be older, so maybe there's a mistake in the interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved with different units or something, but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that \"today\" the father is twice the son's age, and in 10 years, the father will be 1.5 times the son's age at that time.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that in 10 years, the father will be 1.5 times older than the son is today.\n\nBut that would be: F + 10 = 1.5S.\n\nWith F = 2S, then 2S + 10 = 1.5S \u2192 0.5S = -10 \u2192 S = -20.\n\nNegative age doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased incorrectly, and it should be \"the father will be 1.5 times as old as the son in 10 years,\" which is what I originally interpreted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to have a different solution.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider the age difference.\n\nThe age difference between father and son is constant.\n\nToday, F = 2S.\n\nSo, the age difference is F - S = 2S - S = S.\n\nIn 10 years, the age difference remains S.\n\nSo, F + 10 = S + 10 + S = 2S + 10.\n\nBut from the problem, F + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nSo, 2S + 10 = 1.5(S + 10).\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nSolving gives S = 10, F = 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the ratio of their ages.\n\nToday, the ratio is F/S = 2.\n\nIn 10 years, the ratio is (F + 10)/(S + 10) = 1.5.\n\nSo, ratio changes from 2 to 1.5.\n\nWhich aligns with the initial setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of age ratios.\n\nLet me assume that the ratio of their ages changes linearly over time.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference in their age ratios.\n\nToday, F/S = 2.\n\nIn 10 years, (F + 10)/(S + 10) = 1.5.\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\n1) F = 2S\n\n2) (F + 10)/(S + 10) = 1.5\n\nWhich is the same as F + 10 = 1.5(S + 10)\n\nWhich leads to S = 10, F = 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the percentage increase in their ages.\n\nBut that seems unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how much each has aged.\n\nBut again, that seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps graphing the equations could help visualize.\n\nBut in this text-based format, it's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider plugging in different values for S and see which one fits.\n\nLet's try S = 10:\n\nToday: F = 20.\n\nIn 10 years: Son is 20, Father is 30.\n\nIs 30 = 1.5 * 20? Yes, because 1.5 * 20 = 30.\n\nSo, it fits.\n\nAlternatively, try S = 12:\n\nToday: F = 24.\n\nIn 10 years: Son is 22, Father is 34.\n\nIs 34 = 1.5 * 22? 1.5 * 22 = 33, which is not 34.\n\nSo, no.\n\nS = 8:\n\nToday: F = 16.\n\nIn 10 years: Son is 18, Father is 26.\n\nIs 26 = 1.5 * 18? 1.5 * 18 = 27, which is not 26.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, only S = 10 fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the father is twice as old as the son plus or minus some years.\n\nBut that seems unwarranted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that \"today\" the father is twice the son's age, and in 10 years, the father will be 1.5 times the son's age.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have no solution, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the phrase \"1.5 times older.\"\n\nSome people might interpret \"1.5 times older than\" as \"1.5 times the age difference older than.\"\n\nFor example, if the son is 10, and the father is 20 (twice as old), then the age difference is 10 years.\n\n\"1.5 times older than\" could be interpreted as the father being 10 + 1.5*10 = 25 years old in 10 years.\n\nBut that would mean in 10 years, son is 20, father is 25, which is 1.25 times, not 1.5 times.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"1.5 times older than\" means the father is 2.5 times the son's age in 10 years.\n\nBecause \"times older than\" can be misleading.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, that leads to negative ages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's best to stick with the initial interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the son is 10 years old, and the father is 20 years old today.\n\nThis satisfies both conditions given in the problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Son is } 10 \\text{ years old, Father is } 20 \\text{ years old}} \\]"
