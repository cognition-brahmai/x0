        "content": "Let's see. There are 20,000 registered voters in the city, and during the election, 60% of them turn out to vote. So first, I need to find out how many people actually voted.\n\nTo find 60% of 20,000, I can calculate:\n\nVotes cast = 20,000 * 0.60 = 12,000 votes\n\nSo, 12,000 people voted in the election.\n\nNow, the candidate needs at least 55% of these votes to win. So, I need to find out what 55% of 12,000 is.\n\nVotes needed = 12,000 * 0.55 = 6,600 votes\n\nTherefore, the candidate needs at least 6,600 votes to win the election.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps I should consider the total number of voters and the percentage needed directly.\n\nAlternatively, the candidate needs 55% of the votes cast, which is 55% of 12,000, which is indeed 6,600 votes.\n\nAlternatively, if the candidate needs 55% of the registered voters, that would be different. But the question says \"55% of the votes,\" which I interpret as 55% of the votes cast, not of the registered voters.\n\nLet me make sure. If 60% of voters turn out, and the candidate needs 55% of those votes to win, then it's 55% of 12,000, which is 6,600 votes.\n\nAlternatively, if it meant 55% of the registered voters, it would be 20,000 * 0.55 = 11,000 votes. But that doesn't make sense because only 12,000 people voted. So, it must be 55% of the votes cast.\n\nYes, I think my first approach is correct. The candidate needs at least 6,600 votes to win the election.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6600} \\]"
