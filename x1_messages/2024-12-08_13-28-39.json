        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The cyclist has a 96-mile journey and wants to complete it in two equal parts. So, each part is 96 miles divided by 2, which is 48 miles.\n\nNow, the cyclist is traveling at an average speed of 12 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to cover 48 miles at 12 mph, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, for each 48-mile part:\n\nTime = 48 miles / 12 mph = 4 hours\n\nSince there are two parts, the riding time would be 4 hours per part times 2, which is 8 hours in total.\n\nBut there's also a 30-minute break in between the two parts. We need to add that to the total time.\n\nFirst, let's convert 30 minutes to hours because our other times are in hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.\n\nSo, total time = riding time + break time = 8 hours + 0.5 hours = 8.5 hours\n\nTo make it more understandable, 8.5 hours is 8 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the entire trip will take 8 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
