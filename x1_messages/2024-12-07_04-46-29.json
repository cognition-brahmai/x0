        "content": "Let's see. So, the factory produces 500 widgets per hour and operates for 16 hours a day. I need to find out how many widgets it produces in one week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are produced in one day. Since it produces 500 widgets per hour and runs for 16 hours, I can multiply 500 by 16 to get the daily production.\n\n500 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day = 8,000 widgets/day\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 8,000 widgets each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I need to know how many days the factory operates in a week. Typically, a week has 7 days, so if the factory operates every day, I can multiply the daily production by 7.\n\n8,000 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 56,000 widgets/week\n\nSo, the factory produces 56,000 widgets in one week.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total number of hours the factory operates in a week and then multiply that by the hourly production rate.\n\nFirst, find the total operating hours per week:\n\n16 hours/day * 7 days/week = 112 hours/week\n\nThen, multiply the total hours by the production rate:\n\n500 widgets/hour * 112 hours/week = 56,000 widgets/week\n\nOkay, that matches the first method. So, it seems like 56,000 widgets per week is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other factors that might affect production, like downtime or maintenance, but the problem doesn't mention any limitations or variations in operation. It states that the factory operates for 16 hours per day, so I'll assume that's consistent every day of the week.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. We're dealing with widgets per hour and hours per day, and days per week, so the units cancel out appropriately to give widgets per week.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 56,000 widgets per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56000} \\]"
