        "content": "Ah, that's an interesting question! So, you're thinking about a type of bridge that can be raised and lowered to let ships through, and it's also the name of a famous bridge in London. Let me see... I know that London has several iconic bridges crossing the River Thames, like Tower Bridge, London Bridge, and Westminster Bridge. Among these, Tower Bridge is particularly known for its distinctive design.\n\nTower Bridge is a bascule bridge, which means it has movable sections that can be raised to allow tall ships to pass underneath. The term \"bascule\" comes from the French word for \"see-saw,\" reflecting how the bridge's counterweights help lift the heavy sections. This design was innovative when the bridge was built in the late 19th century, as it allowed large vessels to navigate the Thames without disrupting land traffic.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the type of bridge that can be raised and lowered and is also the name of a famous London landmark is a bascule bridge, and the specific bridge you're referring to is Tower Bridge.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are other types of moveable bridges in London. For example, there's also the London Bridge, which has been rebuilt several times. The current London Bridge is a concrete beam bridge, but historically, earlier versions had different designs. However, none of them were bascule bridges like Tower Bridge.\n\nAnother bridge worth mentioning is the Tower Bridge, which is often confused with London Bridge in popular culture, as evidenced by the nursery rhyme \"London Bridge is falling down.\" But in reality, Tower Bridge is the one with the lifting sections.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the bridge type that can be raised and lowered, and which is also the name of a famous London landmark, is the bascule bridge, specifically Tower Bridge.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Tower Bridge:** Opened in 1894, it's a combined bascule and suspension bridge. The bridge's raising mechanism is powered by hydraulics, although modern systems use electricity.\n\n- **Functionality:** The bascules are raised to allow tall ships to pass under the bridge. In recent times, with fewer tall ships on the river, the bridge is raised less frequently, but it still operates for large vessels and special events.\n\n- **Architecture:** Tower Bridge is famous for its Victorian Gothic style, featuring towers and suspension cables, which give it a unique appearance.\n\n- **Tourism:** It's one of London's most recognizable landmarks and a popular tourist attraction, with exhibits and viewing platforms that allow visitors to see the bridge's machinery and learn about its history.\n\nI hope this information helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
