        "content": "Certainly! To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings. The LCS is the longest sequence that appears in both strings in the same order, but not necessarily contiguously.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: We'll create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS of the substrings `str1[0..i-1]` and `str2[0..j-1]`.\n2. **Filling the DP Table**:\n   - If characters match (`str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]`), then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.\n   - If characters don't match, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.\n3. **Reconstructing the LCS**: Once the DP table is filled, we'll backtrack to find the actual LCS.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)\n    \n    # Create a DP table\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Fill the DP table\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # Reconstruct the LCS\n    lcs_length = dp[m][n]\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.insert(0, str1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    \n    return lcs_length, ''.join(lcs)\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = \"ABCBDAB\"\nstr2 = \"BDCAB\"\nlength, lcs = longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2)\nprint(\"Length of LCS:\", length)\nprint(\"LCS:\", lcs)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **DP Table Construction**:\n   - We initialize a `(m+1) x (n+1)` table where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `str1` and `str2` respectively.\n   - We fill this table by comparing characters of both strings. If characters match, we extend the previous LCS length by 1; otherwise, we take the maximum LCS length from the previous states.\n\n2. **Reconstructing the LCS**:\n   - Starting from `dp[m][n]`, we backtrack to construct the LCS.\n   - If characters match, we include them in the LCS and move diagonally up-left.\n   - If they don't match, we move up or left based on which neighbor has a higher value in the DP table.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute both the length and the actual LCS of the two input strings.\n"
