        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here. One leaves Station A going at 80 kilometers per hour, and the other leaves Station B, which is 240 kilometers away from Station A, going towards Station A at 100 kilometers per hour. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the situation. There are two stations, A and B, 240 kilometers apart. Train A is moving from A towards B at 80 km/h, and Train B is moving from B towards A at 100 km/h. They're moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other.\n\nSo, the combined speed is 80 km/h plus 100 km/h, which is 180 km/h. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 180 kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is 240 kilometers. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, it's:\n\nTime = 240 km / 180 km/h\n\nLet me calculate that. 240 divided by 180 is...\n\nWait, 180 goes into 240 once, and 180 times 1 is 180. Subtract that from 240, and you get 60. So, it's 1 and 60/180 hours. Simplifying 60/180, that's 1/3. So, the time is 1 and 1/3 hours.\n\nBut maybe it's better to convert that into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1/3 of an hour is 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time is 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using relative speed or something like that.\n\nLet me think about relative speed. If two objects are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is what I did earlier: 80 + 100 = 180 km/h.\n\nSo, using the relative speed, the time to meet would indeed be the initial distance divided by the relative speed, which is 240 km / 180 km/h = 1.333... hours, or 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could set up an equation based on the distances each train travels.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, Train A travels 80t kilometers.\n\nIn the same t hours, Train B travels 100t kilometers.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the initial distance between them, which is 240 kilometers.\n\nSo, 80t + 100t = 240\n\nCombining like terms, that's 180t = 240\n\nThen, t = 240 / 180 = 1.333... hours, which again is 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can think about it another way to confirm. Let's consider the time from when Train A starts until they meet.\n\nIn that time, Train A has gone 80t kilometers, and Train B has gone 100t kilometers. Since they're approaching each other, the total distance covered by both should be the initial 240 kilometers.\n\nSo, again, 80t + 100t = 240, leading to t = 240 / 180 = 1.333... hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the time from when Train B starts, but since both trains start at the same time, it shouldn't make a difference.\n\nWait, the problem says \"another train leaves Station B, located 240 kilometers away from Station A, traveling towards Station A at 100 kilometers per hour.\" It doesn't specify if they start at the same time or not.\n\nLooking back, it says, \"Another train leaves Station B... traveling towards Station A at 100 kilometers per hour.\" It seems like both trains are leaving at the same time, since it doesn't mention any time delay between their departures.\n\nSo, yes, they start at the same time, one from A and the other from B, moving towards each other.\n\nTherefore, my previous approach is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if one train started before the other. For example, if Train A started first, and Train B started later.\n\nBut according to the problem, both trains leave their stations at the same time, so that's not necessary.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the speed at which the distance between the two trains is decreasing. Since they're moving towards each other, the rate at which the distance decreases is the sum of their speeds, which is 180 km/h, as I previously calculated.\n\nSo, starting from 240 kilometers apart, decreasing at 180 km/h, the time to meet is indeed 240 / 180 = 1.333... hours.\n\nLet me consider units to make sure I'm consistent. All speeds are in kilometers per hour, and the distance is in kilometers, so the time will be in hours.\n\nIf needed, I can convert the time into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 0.333... hours is approximately 20 minutes, so 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, for more precision, 1/3 of an hour is exactly 20 minutes, so it's exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nWait, but 1/3 of an hour is actually 20 minutes, because 60 divided by 3 is 20.\n\nSo, yes, it's exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach using relative velocity.\n\nIn physics, when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative velocity is the sum of their individual velocities.\n\nSo, relative velocity = 80 km/h + 100 km/h = 180 km/h.\n\nThen, time to meet = initial distance / relative velocity = 240 km / 180 km/h = 1.333... hours, or 1 hour 20 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider one train to be stationary and the other moving at the relative velocity of 180 km/h, the time to cover 240 kilometers would still be the same.\n\nSo, all these methods confirm the same answer.\n\nPerhaps I can think about it in terms of proportions. Train A is moving slower than Train B, so it will cover less distance than Train B before they meet.\n\nThe ratio of their speeds is 80:100, which simplifies to 4:5.\n\nTherefore, the distance covered by Train A to the distance covered by Train B should be in the ratio of their speeds, 4:5.\n\nSo, if Train A covers 4 parts of the distance, and Train B covers 5 parts, the total is 9 parts.\n\nThe total distance is 240 kilometers, so each part is 240 / 9 = approximately 26.666... kilometers.\n\nTherefore, Train A covers 4 * 26.666... \u2248 106.666... kilometers, and Train B covers 5 * 26.666... \u2248 133.333... kilometers.\n\nAdding those up, 106.666... + 133.333... = 240 kilometers, which checks out.\n\nThen, the time taken by Train A to cover 106.666... kilometers at 80 km/h is 106.666... / 80 = 1.333... hours, which again is 1 hour 20 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, for Train B, 133.333... / 100 = 1.333... hours, the same time.\n\nSo, all these different methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I've confirmed it thoroughly. The answer is that the two trains will meet after 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
