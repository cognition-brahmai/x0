        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a classroom with 12 boys and 8 girls, and the teacher needs to select a committee of 5 students with at least 2 girls. I need to figure out how many ways this can be done. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that \"at least 2 girls\" means that the committee can have 2 girls, 3 girls, 4 girls, or even 5 girls. So, I need to consider all these possibilities.\n\nI recall that the way to calculate combinations is using the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for this problem, the total number of ways to choose 5 students from 20 (12 boys + 8 girls) without any restrictions would be C(20, 5). But since there's a condition that there must be at least 2 girls, I need to adjust for that.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that don't meet the condition, i.e., committees with fewer than 2 girls.\n\nSo, total committees without restrictions: C(20, 5).\n\nCommittees with fewer than 2 girls: that would be committees with 0 girls or 1 girl.\n\nSo, committees with 0 girls: that's choosing all 5 students from the 12 boys, which is C(12, 5).\n\nCommittees with 1 girl: choosing 1 girl from 8 and 4 boys from 12, which is C(8, 1) * C(12, 4).\n\nTherefore, the number of committees with at least 2 girls would be total committees minus committees with 0 girls minus committees with 1 girl.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nTotal committees = C(20, 5)\n\nCommittees with 0 girls = C(12, 5)\n\nCommittees with 1 girl = C(8, 1) * C(12, 4)\n\nTherefore, committees with at least 2 girls = C(20, 5) - C(12, 5) - C(8, 1) * C(12, 4)\n\nNow, I need to calculate these values.\n\nFirst, C(20, 5) = 20! / (5! * 15!) = (20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 15504.\n\nNext, C(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * 7!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 792.\n\nThen, C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nAnd C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 495.\n\nSo, committees with 1 girl = 8 * 495 = 3960.\n\nTherefore, committees with at least 2 girls = 15504 - 792 - 3960 = 15504 - 4752 = 10752.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Is there another way to approach this to verify the answer?\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of committees with at least 2 girls directly by adding up the committees with exactly 2 girls, exactly 3 girls, exactly 4 girls, and exactly 5 girls.\n\nSo, committees with exactly 2 girls: C(8, 2) * C(12, 3)\n\nExactly 3 girls: C(8, 3) * C(12, 2)\n\nExactly 4 girls: C(8, 4) * C(12, 1)\n\nExactly 5 girls: C(8, 5) * C(12, 0)\n\nThen, sum all these up.\n\nLet's calculate each one.\n\nFirst, C(8, 2) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28.\n\nC(12, 3) = (12 * 11 * 10) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 220.\n\nSo, committees with exactly 2 girls: 28 * 220 = 6160.\n\nNext, C(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56.\n\nC(12, 2) = (12 * 11) / (2 * 1) = 66.\n\nSo, committees with exactly 3 girls: 56 * 66 = 3696.\n\nThen, C(8, 4) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 70.\n\nC(12, 1) = 12.\n\nSo, committees with exactly 4 girls: 70 * 12 = 840.\n\nFinally, C(8, 5) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 56.\n\nC(12, 0) = 1.\n\nSo, committees with exactly 5 girls: 56 * 1 = 56.\n\nNow, sum them up: 6160 + 3696 = 9856; 9856 + 840 = 10696; 10696 + 56 = 10752.\n\nOkay, so I get the same answer as before: 10752.\n\nSo, the number of ways to select a committee of 5 students with at least 2 girls is 10,752.\n\nWait, but that seems like a high number. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst method:\n\nTotal committees: C(20, 5) = 15504.\n\nCommittees with 0 girls: C(12, 5) = 792.\n\nCommittees with 1 girl: C(8, 1) * C(12, 4) = 8 * 495 = 3960.\n\nSo, committees with at least 2 girls: 15504 - 792 - 3960 = 15504 - 4752 = 10752.\n\nSecond method:\n\nExactly 2 girls: C(8, 2) * C(12, 3) = 28 * 220 = 6160.\n\nExactly 3 girls: C(8, 3) * C(12, 2) = 56 * 66 = 3696.\n\nExactly 4 girls: C(8, 4) * C(12, 1) = 70 * 12 = 840.\n\nExactly 5 girls: C(8, 5) * C(12, 0) = 56 * 1 = 56.\n\nTotal: 6160 + 3696 = 9856; 9856 + 840 = 10696; 10696 + 56 = 10752.\n\nBoth methods give the same answer, so it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total number of ways to choose 5 students from 20, which is 15504, and then subtract the number of committees that have fewer than 2 girls, which are the committees with 0 girls and 1 girl.\n\nI've already calculated those as 792 and 3960, respectively, and 792 + 3960 = 4752.\n\nSo, 15504 - 4752 = 10752.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the condition is at least 2 girls, so we're excluding the cases where there are fewer than 2 girls.\n\nSo, again, total committees minus committees with 0 or 1 girl.\n\nI've already calculated that, and it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 10,752.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10752} \\]"
