        "content": "Let's see. There's a class with 30 students, and there are twice as many boys as girls. Then, 8 more girls join the class, and I need to find out how many boys there will be in the class after that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many boys and girls are there initially in the class. Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are twice as many boys as girls, so B = 2G.\n\nAlso, the total number of students is 30, so B + G = 30.\n\nNow, I can substitute the first equation into the second one: 2G + G = 30.\n\nThat simplifies to 3G = 30, so G = 10.\n\nNow, since B = 2G, B = 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nSo, initially, there are 20 boys and 10 girls in the class.\n\nNow, 8 more girls join the class. So, the number of girls becomes 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nBut the number of boys remains the same unless specified otherwise. So, there are still 20 boys in the class.\n\nTherefore, after 8 more girls join, there are still 20 boys in the class.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? The problem asks for the number of boys after 8 more girls join. Since no boys are added or removed, the number of boys should remain 20.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm not seeing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"In a class of 30 students, there are twice as many boys as girls. If 8 more girls join the class, how many boys will there be in the class?\"\n\nSo, initially, B = 2G, and B + G = 30.\n\nFrom that, G = 10, B = 20.\n\nAfter 8 more girls join, G becomes 18, and B remains 20.\n\nSo, the answer should be 20 boys.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to set up a situation where the ratio changes after the new girls join, but it doesn't specify that. It just asks for the number of boys after the new girls join, assuming that only girls are added and no boys are added or removed.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys remains 20.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
