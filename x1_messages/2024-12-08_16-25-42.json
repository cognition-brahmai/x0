        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 20 houses, and each house has either 1 floor or 2 floors. Overall, there are 30 floors in the whole village. We need to figure out how many houses have 2 floors.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being asked. We have two types of houses: those with 1 floor and those with 2 floors. The total number of houses is 20, and the total number of floors is 30. We need to find out how many houses have 2 floors.\n\nMaybe we can set up some equations to represent this situation. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of houses with 1 floor.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of houses with 2 floors.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of houses is 20, so \\( x + y = 20 \\).\n\n2. The total number of floors is 30, so \\( 1x + 2y = 30 \\).\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( x + 2y = 30 \\)\n\nNow, we can solve this system to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by elimination. If we subtract the first equation from the second, the \\( x \\) terms will cancel out:\n\n\\( (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 30 - 20 \\)\n\nSimplifying that, we get:\n\n\\( x + 2y - x - y = 10 \\)\n\nWhich reduces to:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nSo, there are 10 houses with 2 floors.\n\nTo double-check, we can plug this back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x + 10 = 20 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( x = 10 \\)\n\nNow, let's verify if this makes sense:\n\n- 10 houses with 1 floor contribute 10 floors.\n\n- 10 houses with 2 floors contribute 20 floors.\n\n- Total floors: 10 + 20 = 30, which matches the given total.\n\nLooks good! Alternatively, we could have approached this problem using averages or other methods, but this straightforward algebraic approach works well.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that if all houses had 1 floor, there would be 20 floors in total. But we have 30 floors, which is 10 more than expected. Since each house with 2 floors adds an extra floor beyond the first, the 10 extra floors must come from 10 houses having 2 floors each.\n\nThis confirms our earlier result that there are 10 houses with 2 floors.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are 10 houses with 2 floors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
