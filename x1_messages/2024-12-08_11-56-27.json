        "content": "So I've got this problem here about optimizing cargo transportation for a shipping company that wants to use both trucks and trains. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nFirst, there are two modes of transportation: trucks and trains. Each truck can carry 20 tons of cargo and costs $1000 per trip. Each train car can carry 60 tons of cargo and costs $2500 per trip. The company needs to transport 500 tons of cargo within a week, and they want to do this in a way that minimizes transportation costs.\n\nOkay, so I need to find out how many trucks and how many train cars to use to carry exactly 500 tons of cargo, while spending as little money as possible.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( t \\) be the number of trucks used.\n\n- Let \\( r \\) be the number of train cars used.\n\nEach truck carries 20 tons, so all the trucks together carry \\( 20t \\) tons.\n\nEach train car carries 60 tons, so all the train cars together carry \\( 60r \\) tons.\n\nThe total cargo carried should be 500 tons, so:\n\n\\[ 20t + 60r = 500 \\]\n\nThat's the capacity constraint.\n\nNow, the cost for using \\( t \\) trucks is \\( 1000t \\) dollars, and the cost for using \\( r \\) train cars is \\( 2500r \\) dollars. So, the total cost \\( c \\) is:\n\n\\[ c = 1000t + 2500r \\]\n\nI need to minimize \\( c \\), subject to the constraint that \\( 20t + 60r = 500 \\).\n\nThis looks like a linear programming problem, but since we're dealing with whole numbers of trucks and train cars, it might be more apt to consider it as an integer programming problem. But maybe I can solve it using algebra first and see if the solutions are integers.\n\nLet me solve the capacity equation for one of the variables. I'll solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 20t + 60r = 500 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 20:\n\n\\[ t + 3r = 25 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t = 25 - 3r \\]\n\nNow, since \\( t \\) has to be a non-negative integer (you can't have negative trucks), \\( 25 - 3r \\) must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 25 - 3r \\geq 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 3r \\leq 25 \\]\n\n\\[ r \\leq \\frac{25}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ r \\leq 8.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nBut \\( r \\) has to be an integer, so the maximum number of train cars is 8.\n\nSimilarly, \\( r \\) can't be negative, so \\( r \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( r \\) can be any integer from 0 to 8, inclusive.\n\nNow, I can express the cost in terms of \\( r \\) only, using the expression for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ c = 1000(25 - 3r) + 2500r \\]\n\n\\[ c = 25000 - 3000r + 2500r \\]\n\n\\[ c = 25000 - 500r \\]\n\nInteresting. So, the cost decreases as \\( r \\) increases. That means, to minimize cost, I should maximize \\( r \\), the number of train cars.\n\nBut wait, there's a limit to how large \\( r \\) can be. As I found earlier, \\( r \\) can be up to 8.\n\nLet me check what happens when \\( r = 8 \\):\n\n\\[ t = 25 - 3(8) = 25 - 24 = 1 \\]\n\nSo, 1 truck and 8 train cars.\n\nLet me calculate the cost:\n\n\\[ c = 1000(1) + 2500(8) = 1000 + 20000 = 21000 \\]\n\nNow, let's see if using fewer train cars and more trucks would result in a higher cost.\n\nSuppose \\( r = 7 \\):\n\n\\[ t = 25 - 3(7) = 25 - 21 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 1000(4) + 2500(7) = 4000 + 17500 = 21500 \\]\n\nThat's higher than 21000.\n\nLet me try \\( r = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ t = 25 - 3(6) = 25 - 18 = 7 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 1000(7) + 2500(6) = 7000 + 15000 = 22000 \\]\n\nEven higher.\n\nSeems like as I decrease \\( r \\), \\( c \\) increases.\n\nLet me try \\( r = 9 \\):\n\nWait, earlier I found that \\( r \\leq 8 \\), since \\( r \\) has to be an integer and \\( 3r \\leq 25 \\). So, \\( r = 9 \\) would give:\n\n\\[ t = 25 - 3(9) = 25 - 27 = -2 \\]\n\nThat's not possible, you can't have negative trucks. So, \\( r = 8 \\) is indeed the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I use \\( r = 8 \\), \\( t = 1 \\), which is possible.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to use fractional values, but since you can't have a fraction of a truck or a train car, I think I have to stick with integer values.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there are multiple combinations that give the same minimal cost.\n\nLet me see:\n\nAt \\( r = 8 \\), \\( c = 21000 \\)\n\nAt \\( r = 7 \\), \\( c = 21500 \\)\n\nAt \\( r = 6 \\), \\( c = 22000 \\)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the minimal cost is $21,000, achieved by using 1 truck and 8 train cars.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's a combination where \\( r \\) is not an integer, but since \\( r \\) must be an integer, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use fewer train cars and more trucks to achieve the same cost or lower, but from the earlier calculations, it seems not.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe there's a way to use only trucks or only train cars.\n\nIf I use only trucks (\\( r = 0 \\)):\n\n\\[ t = 25 - 0 = 25 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 1000(25) + 2500(0) = 25000 + 0 = 25000 \\]\n\nThat's higher than 21,000.\n\nIf I use only train cars (\\( t = 0 \\)):\n\n\\[ 0 + 60r = 500 \\]\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{500}{60} \\approx 8.333 \\]\n\nBut \\( r \\) has to be an integer, so \\( r = 9 \\), but then \\( t = 25 - 3(9) = -2 \\), which is invalid.\n\nSo, the only valid combinations are for \\( r \\) from 0 to 8, and as shown earlier, the minimal cost is achieved at \\( r = 8 \\), \\( t = 1 \\), with a cost of $21,000.\n\nBut let me see if there's a way to use fewer train cars and adjust the number of trucks to get a lower cost. Suppose I use \\( r = 8 \\), which gives \\( t = 1 \\), cost $21,000.\n\nIf I use \\( r = 8 \\), the train cars carry \\( 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\) tons.\n\nThen, the truck carries \\( 500 - 480 = 20 \\) tons, which is exactly what one truck can carry.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to use \\( r = 7 \\), train cars carry \\( 7 \\times 60 = 420 \\) tons.\n\nThen, trucks need to carry \\( 500 - 420 = 80 \\) tons.\n\nSince each truck carries 20 tons, \\( t = \\frac{80}{20} = 4 \\) trucks.\n\nCost: \\( 4 \\times 1000 + 7 \\times 2500 = 4000 + 17500 = 21500 \\), which is higher.\n\nSimilarly, \\( r = 6 \\), train cars carry \\( 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\) tons.\n\nTrucks carry \\( 500 - 360 = 140 \\) tons.\n\n\\( t = \\frac{140}{20} = 7 \\) trucks.\n\nCost: \\( 7 \\times 1000 + 6 \\times 2500 = 7000 + 15000 = 22000 \\), even higher.\n\nSo, indeed, the minimal cost is achieved when using 1 truck and 8 train cars.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the cost per ton for each mode to see if there's any insight there.\n\nCost per ton for trucks: \\( \\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \\) dollars per ton.\n\nCost per ton for trains: \\( \\frac{2500}{60} \\approx 41.67 \\) dollars per ton.\n\nSo, trains are cheaper per ton than trucks.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to use as many train cars as possible, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use a fraction of a train car to minimize costs, but since we can't do that, sticking with integer values, the minimal cost is with 1 truck and 8 train cars.\n\nLet me see if there's any other constraint I'm missing, like the number of available trucks or train cars, but the problem doesn't specify any such constraints, so I assume that any number of trucks and train cars is available.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the transportation must be within a week, but doesn't specify any time constraints on individual trips, so I don't think that affects the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to use 1 truck and 8 train cars, resulting in a total cost of $21,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ truck and } 8 \\text{ train cars}} \\]"
