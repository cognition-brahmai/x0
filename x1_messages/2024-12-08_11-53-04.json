        "content": "I believe you're referring to the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. One of the most iconic phrases associated with Sherlock Holmes is \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\" However, it's worth noting that this exact phrase is not used in any of the original stories written by Conan Doyle. Instead, variations of it appear, such as \"Elementary\" or \"Elementary, my dear fellow,\" but never precisely \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\" Despite this, the phrase has become deeply ingrained in popular culture as being synonymous with Sherlock Holmes.\n"
