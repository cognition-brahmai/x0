        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from Town A to Town C, making a stop at Town B along the way. The train goes from A to B at 60 miles per hour, and then from B to C at 80 miles per hour. The distance from A to B is 180 miles, and from B to C is 240 miles. I need to find out how long the entire trip takes.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how long it takes to go from A to B, and then from B to C, and add those times together to get the total time.\n\nSo, for the first part, from A to B:\n\nDistance = 180 miles\n\nSpeed = 60 mph\n\nI know that time is equal to distance divided by speed, right? So, time from A to B would be 180 miles divided by 60 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nTime = 180 / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nOkay, so it takes 3 hours to get from A to B.\n\nNow, for the second part, from B to C:\n\nDistance = 240 miles\n\nSpeed = 80 mph\n\nAgain, time is distance divided by speed:\n\nTime = 240 / 80 = 3 hours.\n\nSo, it takes another 3 hours to get from B to C.\n\nNow, to find the total time from A to C, I just need to add these two times together:\n\nTotal time = time from A to B + time from B to C = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's anything else I need to consider. Is there any time spent at Town B, like stopping time? The problem doesn't mention any stopping time, so I think it's safe to assume that the train doesn't stop or take any breaks at Town B.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The distances are in miles, and the speeds are in miles per hour, so dividing miles by miles per hour gives hours, which is correct.\n\nLet me also confirm the calculations:\n\n180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours\n\n240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours\n\nTotal time = 3 + 3 = 6 hours\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average speed for the entire trip, but that might be more complicated, and since the speeds are different for each segment, it's easier just to calculate the time for each part separately and add them up.\n\nSo, the total time for the train to travel from Town A to Town C is 6 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
