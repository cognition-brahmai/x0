        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a group of people standing in a circle, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. The total number of handshakes is 66, and we need to find out how many people were in the group.\n\nFirst off, I know that in these kinds of problems, where everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, the total number of handshakes can be calculated using combinations. Specifically, it's the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n to shake hands, which is denoted as \"n choose 2\" or C(n, 2).\n\nSo, the formula for C(n, 2) is:\n\nC(n, 2) = n(n - 1)/2\n\nAnd we're told that this equals 66:\n\nn(n - 1)/2 = 66\n\nHmm, so I can set up this equation and solve for n.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\nn(n - 1) = 132\n\nNow, let's expand the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 - n = 132\n\nThen, bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nn\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nOkay, now I need to solve this quadratic equation for n. I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1. Let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of 132 are:\n\n1 and 132\n\n2 and 66\n\n3 and 44\n\n4 and 33\n\n6 and 22\n\n11 and 12\n\nLooking for a pair where one is 11 and the other is 12, since 12 - 11 = 1, but we need them to add up to -1. So, if I take -12 and 11, their product is -132 and their sum is -1.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(n - 12)(n + 11) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives me:\n\nn - 12 = 0 \u21d2 n = 12\n\nn + 11 = 0 \u21d2 n = -11\n\nBut n represents the number of people, which can't be negative, so n = 12.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"several possible answers and reasoning for each,\" and rank them. So maybe there are other ways to approach this, or perhaps some constraints I'm missing.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. If there are n people, the first person shakes hands with n-1 others, the second with n-2 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), and so on, until the last person who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone else because they've already done so.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is:\n\n(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 + 0\n\nThis is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is equal to (n-1)n/2.\n\nWait, that's the same as C(n, 2), which is consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nSo, again, (n-1)n/2 = 66 \u21d2 n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0 \u21d2 n = 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to think about this using graph theory, where each person is a vertex and each handshake is an edge. Then, the total number of edges is 66, and we're trying to find the number of vertices n such that the complete graph K_n has 66 edges.\n\nAgain, the number of edges in K_n is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2 = 66, leading to the same equation as before.\n\nSo, again, n = 12.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different interpretation. What if the group isn't completely connected, meaning some people don't shake hands with everyone else. But the problem says \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a restriction due to standing in a circle. But in a circle, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else, the arrangement shouldn't matter; it's still C(n, 2).\n\nAnother thought: maybe some handshakes are double-counted or something, but the problem says \"exactly once,\" so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that handshakes only occur between adjacent people in the circle, but that doesn't align with the statement \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\"\n\nWait, the problem says \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" so it's a complete graph scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the problem, and handshakes only occur across the circle or something, but that doesn't seem to be the case based on the wording.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach, n(n-1)/2 = 66 \u21d2 n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0 \u21d2 n = 12.\n\nLet me verify this. If n = 12, then C(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66, which matches the given number of handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a scenario where there are multiple groups within the circle, but again, the problem states \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" which suggests a single complete graph.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps there are some people who don't participate in handshakes, but the problem says \"each person shakes hands with every other person,\" so that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the circle arrangement imposes some restrictions, but again, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else, the arrangement doesn't matter.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward and accurate solution is n = 12.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for several possible answers and reasoning for each, then rank them.\n\nSo perhaps there are alternative interpretations, even if they're less likely.\n\nAlternative interpretation 1: The circle arrangement means that handshakes only occur between adjacent people.\n\nIn that case, the number of handshakes would be equal to the number of people, since each person shakes hands with two others, but since it's a circle, it's n handshakes.\n\nBut this contradicts the problem statement that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\n\nSo, this interpretation is invalid.\n\nAlternative interpretation 2: Maybe some handshakes are forbidden due to some constraints, but again, the problem says \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" so this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative interpretation 3: Perhaps the circle is divided into two groups, and handshakes only occur within groups or something, but again, contrary to the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, these alternative interpretations are not valid based on the given information.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps using recursion. Let's say with n people, the number of handshakes is C(n, 2). But that just brings us back to the same formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps thinking about adding one person at a time and seeing how many new handshakes are added.\n\nStarting with 2 people: 1 handshake.\n\nAdding a third person: shakes hands with 2 existing people, adding 2 handshakes, for a total of 3.\n\nAdding a fourth: shakes hands with 3 existing people, adding 3, for a total of 6.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is again C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nLeading back to the same equation: n(n-1)/2 = 66 \u21d2 n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0 \u21d2 n = 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph, which again is C(n, 2).\n\nSo, again, n(n-1)/2 = 66 \u21d2 n = 12.\n\nAnother way: perhaps using the concept of handshakes in a round table.\n\nBut again, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else, it's still C(n, 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that handshakes can't cross in a circle, but that would change the nature of the problem.\n\nIf handshakes can't cross, then it's a different scenario, but the problem doesn't mention any such restriction.\n\nTherefore, the only valid interpretation is n(n-1)/2 = 66 \u21d2 n = 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that the circle arrangement leads to some people shaking hands more or less, but again, the problem states that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, so all handshakes are accounted for.\n\nTherefore, any deviation from n(n-1)/2 = 66 would be unfounded.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps considering that the circle has a certain structure that affects handshake counts, but again, if it's a complete graph, the structure doesn't matter.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion remains n = 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the quadratic equation solving.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nWe have n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 528)] / 2\n\n\u221a(1 + 528) = \u221a529 = 23\n\nSo, n = [1 \u00b1 23]/2\n\nn = (1 + 23)/2 = 24/2 = 12\n\nn = (1 - 23)/2 = -22/2 = -11\n\nAgain, n = 12 is the only positive integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem, and handshakes are not mutual (i.e., A shaking hands with B is different from B shaking hands with A), but the problem says \"shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" which implies that handshakes are mutual and not repeated.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is correct.\n\nAnother consideration: perhaps the problem includes the possibility of people shaking hands with themselves, but that doesn't make sense in reality, and it's not stated in the problem, so it's safe to assume n(n-1)/2 = 66.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are some external factors or constraints not mentioned in the problem, but based on the information provided, the straightforward approach is the correct one.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is n = 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
