        "content": "So I've got this survey problem here. Let's break it down step by step. First, there are 500 people surveyed, and 60% of them prefer coffee over tea. So, I need to find out how many people that is.\n\nTo find 60% of 500, I can calculate:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 500 = 300 people\n\nSo, 300 people prefer coffee over tea.\n\nNow, out of these 300 people who prefer coffee, 75% of them also enjoy drinking tea. I need to find out how many people that is.\n\nTo find 75% of 300, I can calculate:\n\n0.75 \u00d7 300 = 225 people\n\nTherefore, 225 people enjoy both coffee and tea.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm understanding the question correctly. The question says: \"If 75% of those who prefer coffee also enjoy drinking tea, how many people enjoy both coffee and tea?\"\n\nYes, that seems straightforward. I've calculated that 300 people prefer coffee, and 75% of those enjoy both coffee and tea, which is 225 people.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider whether there are people who prefer tea over coffee or those who don't prefer either. However, the question is specifically about those who prefer coffee and also enjoy tea.\n\nSo, the answer should be 225 people enjoy both coffee and tea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{225} \\]"
