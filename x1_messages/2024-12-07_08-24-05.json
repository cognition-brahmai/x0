        "content": "So I have this statement to prove or disprove: For all integers n, the expression n\u00b2 + n + 41 is prime. Okay, let's see. This looks like a quadratic polynomial, and it's being suggested that no matter what integer n you plug in, this expression will always give you a prime number. Hmm, that seems like a pretty strong claim. I wonder if it's true.\n\nFirst, I should probably try plugging in some small integer values for n and see what comes out. That might give me some insight into whether this is always prime or not.\n\nLet's start with n = 0:\n\n0\u00b2 + 0 + 41 = 41, which is prime.\n\nOkay, that checks out.\n\nNow, n = 1:\n\n1\u00b2 + 1 + 41 = 1 + 1 + 41 = 43, which is also prime.\n\nn = 2:\n\n2\u00b2 + 2 + 41 = 4 + 2 + 41 = 47, prime.\n\nn = 3:\n\n3\u00b2 + 3 + 41 = 9 + 3 + 41 = 53, prime.\n\nn = 4:\n\n4\u00b2 + 4 + 41 = 16 + 4 + 41 = 61, prime.\n\nn = 5:\n\n5\u00b2 + 5 + 41 = 25 + 5 + 41 = 71, prime.\n\nn = 6:\n\n6\u00b2 + 6 + 41 = 36 + 6 + 41 = 83, prime.\n\nn = 7:\n\n7\u00b2 + 7 + 41 = 49 + 7 + 41 = 97, prime.\n\nn = 8:\n\n8\u00b2 + 8 + 41 = 64 + 8 + 41 = 113, prime.\n\nn = 9:\n\n9\u00b2 + 9 + 41 = 81 + 9 + 41 = 131, prime.\n\nn = 10:\n\n10\u00b2 + 10 + 41 = 100 + 10 + 41 = 151, prime.\n\nOkay, so far, for n from 0 to 10, the expression gives prime numbers. This seems promising, but does it continue forever? Let's try a few more values.\n\nn = 11:\n\n11\u00b2 + 11 + 41 = 121 + 11 + 41 = 173, which is prime.\n\nn = 12:\n\n12\u00b2 + 12 + 41 = 144 + 12 + 41 = 197, prime.\n\nn = 13:\n\n13\u00b2 + 13 + 41 = 169 + 13 + 41 = 223, prime.\n\nn = 14:\n\n14\u00b2 + 14 + 41 = 196 + 14 + 41 = 251, prime.\n\nn = 15:\n\n15\u00b2 + 15 + 41 = 225 + 15 + 41 = 281, prime.\n\nn = 16:\n\n16\u00b2 + 16 + 41 = 256 + 16 + 41 = 313, prime.\n\nn = 17:\n\n17\u00b2 + 17 + 41 = 289 + 17 + 41 = 347, prime.\n\nn = 18:\n\n18\u00b2 + 18 + 41 = 324 + 18 + 41 = 383, prime.\n\nn = 19:\n\n19\u00b2 + 19 + 41 = 361 + 19 + 41 = 421, prime.\n\nn = 20:\n\n20\u00b2 + 20 + 41 = 400 + 20 + 41 = 461, prime.\n\nWow, up to n = 20, it's still giving prime numbers. This is impressive, but I need to check more values to see if this pattern holds indefinitely.\n\nn = 21:\n\n21\u00b2 + 21 + 41 = 441 + 21 + 41 = 503, prime.\n\nn = 22:\n\n22\u00b2 + 22 + 41 = 484 + 22 + 41 = 547, prime.\n\nn = 23:\n\n23\u00b2 + 23 + 41 = 529 + 23 + 41 = 593, prime.\n\nn = 24:\n\n24\u00b2 + 24 + 41 = 576 + 24 + 41 = 641, prime.\n\nn = 25:\n\n25\u00b2 + 25 + 41 = 625 + 25 + 41 = 691, prime.\n\nn = 26:\n\n26\u00b2 + 26 + 41 = 676 + 26 + 41 = 743, prime.\n\nn = 27:\n\n27\u00b2 + 27 + 41 = 729 + 27 + 41 = 797, prime.\n\nn = 28:\n\n28\u00b2 + 28 + 41 = 784 + 28 + 41 = 853, prime.\n\nn = 29:\n\n29\u00b2 + 29 + 41 = 841 + 29 + 41 = 911, prime.\n\nn = 30:\n\n30\u00b2 + 30 + 41 = 900 + 30 + 41 = 971, prime.\n\nStill all primes. This is really surprising. Maybe this formula generates primes for all n. But I should check a few more values to be sure.\n\nn = 31:\n\n31\u00b2 + 31 + 41 = 961 + 31 + 41 = 1033, prime.\n\nn = 32:\n\n32\u00b2 + 32 + 41 = 1024 + 32 + 41 = 1097, prime.\n\nn = 33:\n\n33\u00b2 + 33 + 41 = 1089 + 33 + 41 = 1163, prime.\n\nn = 34:\n\n34\u00b2 + 34 + 41 = 1156 + 34 + 41 = 1231, prime.\n\nn = 35:\n\n35\u00b2 + 35 + 41 = 1225 + 35 + 41 = 1301, prime.\n\nn = 36:\n\n36\u00b2 + 36 + 41 = 1296 + 36 + 41 = 1373, prime.\n\nn = 37:\n\n37\u00b2 + 37 + 41 = 1369 + 37 + 41 = 1447, prime.\n\nn = 38:\n\n38\u00b2 + 38 + 41 = 1444 + 38 + 41 = 1523, prime.\n\nn = 39:\n\n39\u00b2 + 39 + 41 = 1521 + 39 + 41 = 1601, prime.\n\nn = 40:\n\n40\u00b2 + 40 + 41 = 1600 + 40 + 41 = 1681.\n\nWait a minute, 1681. Is 1681 a prime number? Let's see, 1681 divided by, say, 41. 41 times 41 is 1681. So, 41 * 41 = 1681. That means 1681 is 41 squared, which makes it a perfect square. Therefore, 1681 is not a prime number; it's 41 squared.\n\nSo, when n = 40, n\u00b2 + n + 41 = 1681, which is not prime.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"For all integers n, n\u00b2 + n + 41 is prime\" is false. We have found a counterexample where n = 40, and the expression yields 1681, which is not a prime number.\n\nInteresting, so while the formula generates primes for many values of n, especially for n from 0 to 39, it fails at n = 40. This shows that even patterns that hold for many initial cases might break down eventually.\n\nIt's also worth noting that for negative integers, let's check if the expression still holds.\n\nFor n = -1:\n\n(-1)\u00b2 + (-1) + 41 = 1 - 1 + 41 = 41, which is prime.\n\nn = -2:\n\n(-2)\u00b2 + (-2) + 41 = 4 - 2 + 41 = 43, prime.\n\nn = -3:\n\n(-3)\u00b2 + (-3) + 41 = 9 - 3 + 41 = 47, prime.\n\nn = -4:\n\n(-4)\u00b2 + (-4) + 41 = 16 - 4 + 41 = 53, prime.\n\nn = -5:\n\n(-5)\u00b2 + (-5) + 41 = 25 - 5 + 41 = 61, prime.\n\nSeems like for negative n, at least for n = -1 to -5, it still gives primes. Maybe it holds for all negative integers as well, but given that it fails for n = 40, which is positive, it's likely that there are negative integers where it also fails.\n\nWait, let's try n = -41:\n\n(-41)\u00b2 + (-41) + 41 = 1681 - 41 + 41 = 1681, which is the same as when n = 40, and 1681 is not prime.\n\nSo, for n = -41, the expression also gives 1681, which is not prime.\n\nTherefore, the statement is disproven by both n = 40 and n = -41.\n\nIt's interesting to see that the expression n\u00b2 + n + 41 generates primes for a significant range of n values, but eventually, it does produce composite numbers.\n\nThis kind of polynomial is sometimes used to generate sequences of prime numbers, but as we've seen, it's not foolproof for all integer values of n.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement is false because there exist integers n (such as n = 40 and n = -41) for which n\u00b2 + n + 41 is not a prime number.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{false}} \\]"
