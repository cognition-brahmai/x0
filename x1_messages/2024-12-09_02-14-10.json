        "content": "So there are 25 students in the class overall. Out of these, 10 students have blue eyes, which means the remaining students have brown eyes. To find out how many have brown eyes, I can subtract the number of blue-eyed students from the total number of students.\n\nSo, 25 total students minus 10 blue-eyed students equals 15 brown-eyed students.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of the class that has brown eyes, I need to find out what part of the total class the 15 brown-eyed students represent. Percentage is a way to express a part of a whole out of 100.\n\nThe formula for percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of brown-eyed students, which is 15, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students, which is 25.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage of brown-eyed students} = \\left( \\frac{15}{25} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide 15 by 25:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{25} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.6 \\times 100 = 60\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, 60% of the class has brown eyes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in simpler terms. Since 10 out of 25 students have blue eyes, that's 10 divided by 25, which is 0.4, or 40%. Therefore, the remaining percentage must have brown eyes, which is 100% minus 40%, equaling 60%.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see that 25 students can be divided into 100 percentage points. Each student represents \\(\\frac{100}{25} = 4\\%\\) of the class. Since there are 15 brown-eyed students, their percentage would be \\(15 \\times 4\\% = 60\\%\\).\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: 60% of the class has brown eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
