        "content": "So, there's this problem here. It says that in a city with 200,000 people, 60% of them own cars. And each car owner has an average of 1.5 cars. I need to find out how many cars there are in total in the city.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to find out how many people own cars. Since 60% of the population owns cars, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 200,000.\n\nSo, number of car owners = 60% of 200,000.\n\nI know that 60% is the same as 0.60 in decimal form. So, number of car owners = 0.60 \u00d7 200,000.\n\nLet me do the math: 0.60 \u00d7 200,000 = 120,000.\n\nSo, there are 120,000 car owners in the city.\n\nNext, it says that each car owner has an average of 1.5 cars. So, to find the total number of cars, I need to multiply the number of car owners by the average number of cars per owner.\n\nTotal cars = number of car owners \u00d7 average cars per owner.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: Total cars = 120,000 \u00d7 1.5.\n\nLet's calculate that: 120,000 \u00d7 1.5 = 180,000.\n\nSo, there are 180,000 cars in the city.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 60% of 200,000 is indeed 120,000. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 120,000 owners each with 1.5 cars on average gives 180,000 cars. That also seems right.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can think about it differently. Suppose every car owner had exactly 1 car. Then, with 120,000 car owners, there would be 120,000 cars.\n\nBut since each owner has an average of 1.5 cars, that means for every car owner, there are 0.5 extra cars.\n\nSo, the total number of extra cars would be 120,000 \u00d7 0.5 = 60,000.\n\nAdding that to the initial 120,000 cars gives 180,000 cars, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlright, that gives me confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Let's see.\n\nTotal cars can also be thought of as the product of the total population, the percentage that owns cars, and the average number of cars per owner.\n\nSo, total cars = total population \u00d7 percentage of car owners \u00d7 average cars per owner.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: total cars = 200,000 \u00d7 0.60 \u00d7 1.5.\n\nFirst, 200,000 \u00d7 0.60 = 120,000.\n\nThen, 120,000 \u00d7 1.5 = 180,000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive. There are 180,000 cars in the city.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, are there any cars in the city that aren't owned by individuals, like rental cars or business vehicles? The problem doesn't mention any, so I think it's safe to assume that all cars are owned by the people in the city.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"each car owner has an average of 1.5 cars.\" It doesn't specify whether this includes cars that might be owned by multiple people or any other complications, so I'll take it at face value.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cars in the city is 180,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180000} \\]"
