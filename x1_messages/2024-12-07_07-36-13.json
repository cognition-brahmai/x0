        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express to manage a collection of books. Since we're not using any external databases, I'll store the books in-memory, probably using an array.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a new Node.js project. I'll create a new directory for my project and initialize it with npm.\n\n```bash\nmkdir book-api\ncd book-api\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nNext, I'll install Express, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.\n\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\nNow, I'll create a new file called `app.js` and set up the basic structure of an Express app.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nGreat, now the server is set up and listening on port 3000. Next, I need to define the endpoints for managing books.\n\nI'll start by creating an in-memory array to store the books.\n\n```javascript\nlet books = [];\nlet idCounter = 1;\n```\n\nEach book will have an id, title, and author. I'll make sure that each new book gets a unique id.\n\nNow, let's define the endpoints:\n\n1. **GET /books**: Retrieve all books.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(books);\n});\n```\n\n2. **POST /books**: Create a new book.\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title, author } = req.body;\n  const newBook = { id: idCounter++, title, author };\n  books.push(newBook);\n  res.status(201).json(newBook);\n});\n```\n\n3. **GET /books/:id**: Retrieve a specific book by id.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const book = books.find(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n  if (book) {\n    res.json(book);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n4. **PUT /books/:id**: Update a book by id.\n\n```javascript\napp.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const book = books.find(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n  if (book) {\n    book.title = req.body.title || book.title;\n    book.author = req.body.author || book.author;\n    res.json(book);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n5. **DELETE /books/:id**: Delete a book by id.\n\n```javascript\napp.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n  if (index !== -1) {\n    const deletedBook = books.splice(index, 1)[0];\n    res.json(deletedBook);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n6. **GET /books?title=**: Search for books by title.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title } = req.query;\n  if (title) {\n    const filteredBooks = books.filter(b => b.title.includes(title));\n    res.json(filteredBooks);\n  } else {\n    res.json(books);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n7. **GET /books?author=**: Search for books by author.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { author } = req.query;\n  if (author) {\n    const filteredBooks = books.filter(b => b.author.includes(author));\n    res.json(filteredBooks);\n  } else {\n    res.json(books);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWait a minute, I have two GET /books endpoints, one for searching by title and one for searching by author. I need to combine them into a single endpoint that can handle both title and author queries.\n\nLet me adjust the GET /books endpoint to handle both title and author queries.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title, author } = req.query;\n  let filteredBooks = books;\n\n  if (title) {\n    filteredBooks = filteredBooks.filter(b => b.title.includes(title));\n  }\n\n  if (author) {\n    filteredBooks = filteredBooks.filter(b => b.author.includes(author));\n  }\n\n  res.json(filteredBooks);\n});\n```\n\nThat should work. Now, if someone queries with ?title= or ?author=, or both, it will filter the books accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the server can parse JSON bodies for POST and PUT requests. I'll use the express.json() middleware.\n\n```javascript\napp.use(express.json());\n```\n\nI should place this before defining the routes.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together in `app.js`.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\n// In-memory storage for books\nlet books = [];\nlet idCounter = 1;\n\n// Middleware to parse JSON bodies\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Get all books or search by title and/or author\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title, author } = req.query;\n  let filteredBooks = books;\n\n  if (title) {\n    filteredBooks = filteredBooks.filter(b => b.title.includes(title));\n  }\n\n  if (author) {\n    filteredBooks = filteredBooks.filter(b => b.author.includes(author));\n  }\n\n  res.json(filteredBooks);\n});\n\n// Get a specific book by id\napp.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const book = books.find(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n  if (book) {\n    res.json(book);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n\n// Create a new book\napp.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title, author } = req.body;\n  const newBook = { id: idCounter++, title, author };\n  books.push(newBook);\n  res.status(201).json(newBook);\n});\n\n// Update a book by id\napp.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const book = books.find(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n  if (book) {\n    book.title = req.body.title || book.title;\n    book.author = req.body.author || book.author;\n    res.json(book);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n\n// Delete a book by id\napp.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n  if (index !== -1) {\n    const deletedBook = books.splice(index, 1)[0];\n    res.json(deletedBook);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nI think that covers all the required endpoints. Now, I can test this API using tools like curl or Postman to ensure it works as expected.\n\nFor example:\n\n- To get all books: `GET http://localhost:3000/books`\n\n- To search for books by title: `GET http://localhost:3000/books?title=Node.js`\n\n- To search for books by author: `GET http://localhost:3000/books?author=Example Author`\n\n- To get a specific book: `GET http://localhost:3000/books/1`\n\n- To create a new book: `POST http://localhost:3000/books` with JSON body `{ \"title\": \"New Book\", \"author\": \"New Author\" }`\n\n- To update a book: `PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1` with JSON body `{ \"title\": \"Updated Title\" }`\n\n- To delete a book: `DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/1`\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as trying to update or delete a book that doesn't exist, or sending invalid data in requests.\n\nAdditionally, since this is an in-memory storage, all data will be lost when the server restarts. In a real-world scenario, I would persist data to a database.\n\nThat's it for now. This should serve as a basic RESTful API for managing books.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of books using Node.js and Express without an external database, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up the Project:**\n    - Initialize a new Node.js project:\n      ```bash\n      mkdir book-api\n      cd book-api\n      npm init -y\n      ```\n    - Install Express:\n      ```bash\n      npm install express\n      ```\n\n2. **Create the Express Application:**\n    - Create `app.js`:\n      ```javascript\n      const express = require('express');\n      const app = express();\n      const port = 3000;\n\n      // In-memory storage for books\n      let books = [];\n      let idCounter = 1;\n\n      // Middleware to parse JSON bodies\n      app.use(express.json());\n\n      // Get all books or search by title and/or author\n      app.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n        const { title, author } = req.query;\n        let filteredBooks = books;\n\n        if (title) {\n          filteredBooks = filteredBooks.filter(b => b.title.includes(title));\n        }\n\n        if (author) {\n          filteredBooks = filteredBooks.filter(b => b.author.includes(author));\n        }\n\n        res.json(filteredBooks);\n      });\n\n      // Get a specific book by id\n      app.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n        const book = books.find(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n        if (book) {\n          res.json(book);\n        } else {\n          res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n        }\n      });\n\n      // Create a new book\n      app.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n        const { title, author } = req.body;\n        const newBook = { id: idCounter++, title, author };\n        books.push(newBook);\n        res.status(201).json(newBook);\n      });\n\n      // Update a book by id\n      app.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n        const book = books.find(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n        if (book) {\n          book.title = req.body.title || book.title;\n          book.author = req.body.author || book.author;\n          res.json(book);\n        } else {\n          res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n        }\n      });\n\n      // Delete a book by id\n      app.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n        const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === parseInt(req.params.id));\n        if (index !== -1) {\n          const deletedBook = books.splice(index, 1)[0];\n          res.json(deletedBook);\n        } else {\n          res.status(404).json({ message: 'Book not found' });\n        }\n      });\n\n      app.listen(port, () => {\n        console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n      });\n      ```\n\n3. **Run the Server:**\n    - Start the server:\n      ```bash\n      node app.js\n      ```\n\n4. **Test the API:**\n    - Use tools like curl or Postman to test the endpoints:\n      - Get all books: `GET http://localhost:3000/books`\n      - Search by title: `GET http://localhost:3000/books?title=Node.js`\n      - Search by author: `GET http://localhost:3000/books?author=Example Author`\n      - Get a specific book: `GET http://localhost:3000/books/1`\n      - Create a book: `POST http://localhost:3000/books` with body `{\"title\": \"New Book\", \"author\": \"New Author\"}`\n      - Update a book: `PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1` with body `{\"title\": \"Updated Title\"}`\n      - Delete a book: `DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/1`\n\nThis setup provides a basic RESTful API for book management with create, read, update, delete, and search functionalities using in-memory storage."
