        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The company has an annual revenue of $1,200,000. It spends certain percentages on different expenses: 25% on salaries, 15% on rent, and 10% on utilities. I need to find out how much is left after these expenses.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much each of these expenses amounts to in dollars.\n\nStarting with salaries:\n\n25% of $1,200,000.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 1,200,000 by 0.25.\n\n1,200,000 * 0.25 = 300,000.\n\nSo, salaries cost $300,000.\n\nNext, rent:\n\n15% of $1,200,000.\n\nAgain, multiply 1,200,000 by 0.15.\n\n1,200,000 * 0.15 = 180,000.\n\nRent is $180,000.\n\nThen, utilities:\n\n10% of $1,200,000.\n\nMultiply 1,200,000 by 0.10.\n\n1,200,000 * 0.10 = 120,000.\n\nUtilities cost $120,000.\n\nNow, I need to add up all these expenses to find the total amount spent.\n\nSalaries: $300,000\n\nRent: $180,000\n\nUtilities: $120,000\n\nTotal expenses = 300,000 + 180,000 + 120,000.\n\nLet's add those up:\n\n300,000 + 180,000 = 480,000\n\n480,000 + 120,000 = 600,000\n\nSo, total expenses are $600,000.\n\nNow, to find the remaining amount after these expenses, I subtract the total expenses from the annual revenue.\n\nRemaining amount = Revenue - Total expenses\n\nRemaining amount = 1,200,000 - 600,000 = 600,000\n\nTherefore, the remaining amount after salaries, rent, and utilities is $600,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate this without finding each expense separately?\n\nLet me think.\n\nThe total percentage spent on expenses is 25% (salaries) + 15% (rent) + 10% (utilities) = 50%.\n\nSo, 50% of the revenue is spent on these expenses.\n\nTherefore, the remaining percentage is 100% - 50% = 50%.\n\nSo, the remaining amount is 50% of the revenue.\n\n50% of $1,200,000 is $600,000.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer: $600,000 remaining after expenses.\n\nIt's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600000} \\]"
