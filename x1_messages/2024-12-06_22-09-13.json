        "content": "Let's see. The father has three sons: Tom, Dick, and Harry. And each son has an older sister. So, if each son has an older sister, that means the sister is older than all three sons. So, there's one older sister who is older than Tom, Dick, and Harry. So, in total, the father has three sons and one daughter, making it four children. Wait, but the question says \"each son has an older sister,\" which implies that there is at least one older sister shared among the three sons. It doesn't specify that each son has a different older sister. So, it's likely that there is only one older sister who is older than all three sons. Therefore, the father has four children: three sons and one daughter. But let me think again. If each son has an older sister, and it's the same sister for all three, then it's four children. But if each son has a different older sister, then it could be more. But the wording suggests that it's the same sister for all three sons. So, I think the answer is four children. But maybe I should consider other possibilities. Perhaps there are multiple sisters, but the most straightforward interpretation is that there is one older sister shared by all three sons. So, I'll go with four children."
