        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a store sells 12 different types of fruit, and I need to figure out how many ways I can choose 3 fruits without repeating any. Hmm, sounds like a combination problem, right? Because the order doesn't matter; I just need to know which fruits I'm picking, not in what order.\n\nOkay, so in combinations, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which means the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 12 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\).\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3!(12 - 3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I know that calculating factorials can get messy with large numbers, but here, 12! is a big number, and 9! is also big, but they share common terms.\n\nLet me think: 12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9!, so the 9! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 3! is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 6.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the numerator first:\n\n12 \u00d7 11 = 132\n\n132 \u00d7 10 = 1320\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n1320 \u00f7 6 = 220\n\nSo, there are 220 different ways to choose 3 fruits from 12 without repetition.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe using permutations?\n\nWell, in permutations, order matters, and the formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, order doesn't matter, so combinations are the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as selecting the first fruit: there are 12 options.\n\nThen, the second fruit: since I can't repeat, there are 11 options left.\n\nThen, the third fruit: 10 options remaining.\n\nSo, that's 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 = 1320.\n\nBut wait, that's the number of permutations, where order matters.\n\nSince in combinations, the order doesn't matter, I need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 fruits, which is 3! = 6.\n\nSo, 1320 \u00f7 6 = 220, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlright, that makes sense.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nMaybe using the concept of combinations with restrictions, but in this case, there are no restrictions other than not repeating fruits.\n\nSo, the basic combination formula suffices.\n\nLet me see if I can think of it in terms of binary choices.\n\nSuppose I have 12 fruits, and for each fruit, I can either choose it or not choose it.\n\nBut since I need to choose exactly 3, it's not simply 2^12, because that would be all possible subsets.\n\nNo, that's not helpful in this context.\n\nStick with the combination formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could list out all possible combinations, but that would be time-consuming and impractical for large n.\n\nSo, for n=12 and k=3, C(12,3)=220 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's verify with smaller numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 4 fruits, and I want to choose 2.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n1. Apple, Banana\n\n2. Apple, Cherry\n\n3. Apple, Date\n\n4. Banana, Cherry\n\n5. Banana, Date\n\n6. Cherry, Date\n\nYes, 6 combinations, which matches the formula.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to n=12 and k=3, C(12,3)=220.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 220 ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{220} \\]"
