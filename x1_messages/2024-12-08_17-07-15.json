        "content": "Let's see. I have this recursive sequence defined by a_1 = 3, and for n > 1, a_n = 2 * a_(n-1) + 1. I need to find the value of a_5.\n\nOkay, so recursive sequences work by defining each term based on the previous term(s). Here, each term a_n depends on the previous term a_(n-1). So, to find a_5, I need to find a_4 first, and so on, back to a_1, which is given.\n\nLet me start by writing down what I know:\n\na_1 = 3\n\na_2 = 2 * a_1 + 1\n\na_3 = 2 * a_2 + 1\n\na_4 = 2 * a_3 + 1\n\na_5 = 2 * a_4 + 1\n\nSo, I need to calculate each term step by step.\n\nFirst, a_2:\n\na_2 = 2 * a_1 + 1 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nNext, a_3:\n\na_3 = 2 * a_2 + 1 = 2 * 7 + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15\n\nThen, a_4:\n\na_4 = 2 * a_3 + 1 = 2 * 15 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31\n\nFinally, a_5:\n\na_5 = 2 * a_4 + 1 = 2 * 31 + 1 = 62 + 1 = 63\n\nSo, the value of a_5 is 63.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\na_1 = 3\n\na_2 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\n\na_3 = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\na_4 = 2 * 15 + 1 = 31\n\na_5 = 2 * 31 + 1 = 63\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I know that some recursive sequences can be expressed explicitly, without referring to previous terms. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n and then find a_5 directly.\n\nGiven the recursive definition a_n = 2 * a_(n-1) + 1, with a_1 = 3.\n\nThis is a linear recursive sequence of the form a_n = 2 * a_(n-1) + 1.\n\nI recall that for linear recursive sequences of the form a_n = r * a_(n-1) + k, the general solution can be found.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution by solving a_n - r * a_(n-1) = 0.\n\nIn this case, r = 2, so the homogeneous equation is a_n - 2 * a_(n-1) = 0.\n\nThe solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^h = c * 2^n, where c is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation a_n - 2 * a_(n-1) = 1.\n\nSince the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (k = 1), I can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\nA - 2 * A = 1\n\n- A = 1\n\nA = -1\n\nSo, the particular solution is a_n^p = -1.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = c * 2^n - 1.\n\nNow, use the initial condition a_1 = 3 to find c.\n\na_1 = c * 2^1 - 1 = 2c - 1 = 3\n\n2c - 1 = 3\n\n2c = 4\n\nc = 2\n\nThus, the explicit formula for a_n is a_n = 2 * 2^n - 1 = 2^(n+1) - 1.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n = 1:\n\na_1 = 2^(1+1) - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \u2705\n\nFor n = 2:\n\na_2 = 2^(2+1) - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \u2705\n\nFor n = 3:\n\na_3 = 2^(3+1) - 1 = 2^4 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15 \u2705\n\nFor n = 4:\n\na_4 = 2^(4+1) - 1 = 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31 \u2705\n\nFor n = 5:\n\na_5 = 2^(5+1) - 1 = 2^6 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63 \u2705\n\nSo, the explicit formula confirms that a_5 is indeed 63.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that this sequence resembles the form of 2^n - 1, but with different initial conditions.\n\nIn general, sequences defined by a_n = 2 * a_(n-1) + k can be solved using this method, and in this case, k = 1.\n\nIt's good to know both the recursive and explicit approaches, as sometimes one might be more efficient than the other, depending on the situation.\n\nFor example, if I needed to find a_100, calculating recursively would be time-consuming, whereas plugging into the explicit formula would be much faster.\n\nIn this case, since n = 5 is small, both methods are manageable.\n\nBut for the sake of completeness, I'll use the explicit formula to find a_5 again.\n\na_n = 2^(n+1) - 1\n\na_5 = 2^(5+1) - 1 = 2^6 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed sufficiently that a_5 is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]"
