        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 people in the room. Half of them are sitting, a third are standing, and the rest are lying down. I need to find out how many are lying down.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many are sitting. Half of 12 is 6, so 6 people are sitting.\n\nNext, a third of them are standing. A third of 12 is 4, so 4 people are standing.\n\nNow, to find out how many are lying down, I'll subtract the number of sitting and standing people from the total number of people.\n\nSo, total people are 12, sitting are 6, standing are 4. That leaves 12 - 6 - 4 = 2 people lying down.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 6 are sitting and 4 are standing, that's 6 + 4 = 10 people. So, 12 - 10 = 2 people lying down.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
