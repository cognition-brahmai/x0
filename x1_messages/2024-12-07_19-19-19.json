The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance on the highway is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance_highway = 30 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 60 miles\n\nNext, the car exits the highway and travels at 20 miles per hour for another 2 hours. So, the distance after exiting the highway is:\n\nDistance_off_highway = 20 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 40 miles\n\nNow, let's find the total distance traveled:\n\nTotal distance = Distance_highway + Distance_off_highway\nTotal distance = 60 miles + 40 miles = 100 miles\n\nThe total time taken for the entire trip is:\n\nTotal time = Time on highway + Time off highway\nTotal time = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours\n\nFinally, the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 100 miles / 4 hours = 25 miles per hour\n\nSo, the average speed of the car during the entire trip is 25 mph."
