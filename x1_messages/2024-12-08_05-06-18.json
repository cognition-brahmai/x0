        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The hospital wants to expand its emergency department by adding 50 additional beds. Each bed requires $15,000 in equipment and furniture. So, first, I need to calculate the total initial investment for the beds.\n\nTotal initial investment for beds = Number of beds * Cost per bed\nTotal initial investment for beds = 50 beds * $15,000/bed = $750,000\n\nNow, the hospital needs to hire more staff to accommodate the increased patient capacity. They need to estimate the number of nurses and support staff required. The nurse-to-patient ratio is 1:4, meaning one nurse for every four patients. So, for 50 additional beds, assuming all beds are occupied, they would need:\n\nNumber of nurses = Number of beds / Nurse-to-patient ratio\nNumber of nurses = 50 beds / 4 = 12.5\n\nSince you can't have half a nurse, they would need to hire 13 nurses.\n\nNext, the support staff-to-nurse ratio is 1:3, meaning one support staff member for every three nurses. So, for 13 nurses, they would need:\n\nNumber of support staff = Number of nurses / Support staff-to-nurse ratio\nNumber of support staff = 13 nurses / 3 \u2248 4.33\n\nAgain, you can't have a fraction of a support staff member, so they would need to hire 5 support staff members.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the ongoing staffing costs. The average annual salary for nurses is $70,000 and for support staff is $40,000.\n\nTotal annual staffing cost = (Number of nurses * Salary per nurse) + (Number of support staff * Salary per support staff)\nTotal annual staffing cost = (13 nurses * $70,000/nurse) + (5 support staff * $40,000/support staff)\nTotal annual staffing cost = ($910,000) + ($200,000) = $1,110,000\n\nSo, the initial investment for the expansion is $750,000, and the ongoing annual staffing cost is $1,110,000.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Initial investment: $750,000\n- Annual staffing cost: $1,110,000\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. All 50 beds will be occupied at all times.\n2. Nurses and support staff work full-time.\n3. No additional costs for training, benefits, or other expenses are considered.\n4. The nurse-to-patient ratio and support staff-to-nurse ratio are strictly adhered to.\n\n**Sensitivity Analysis:**\n- **Bed Occupancy:** If the beds are not always full, the number of nurses required might be adjusted based on average occupancy rates.\n- **Staffing Ratios:** Different healthcare standards or best practices might require different staffing ratios.\n- **Salary Variations:** Salaries can vary based on location, experience, and demand in the job market.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Consider implementing a contingency plan for varying bed occupancy rates.\n- Review local healthcare regulations to ensure compliance with staffing ratios.\n- Conduct a market analysis to confirm salary estimates and factor in benefits and other employment costs.\n\nThis analysis provides a baseline for the hospital's expansion plans. However, it's essential to consider additional factors such as facility renovation costs, equipment maintenance, and potential increases in utility and supply expenses."
