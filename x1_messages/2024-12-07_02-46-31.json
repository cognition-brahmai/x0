        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a garden. The garden is rectangular, and it's currently 20 meters long and 15 meters wide. The gardener wants to expand it by extending both the length and the width by the same amount, and the goal is to double the area. I need to find out what the new dimensions will be.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what the original area is. For a rectangle, area is length times width, right? So, original area is 20 meters times 15 meters, which is 300 square meters. If the gardener wants to double that, the new area should be 600 square meters.\n\nNow, the gardener is going to extend both the length and the width by the same amount. Let's call that amount \"x\" meters. So, the new length will be 20 + x meters, and the new width will be 15 + x meters.\n\nThe area of the new garden will be (20 + x) times (15 + x), and that should equal 600 square meters. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n(20 + x) * (15 + x) = 600\n\nI need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, I'll expand the left side:\n\n20*15 + 20*x + 15*x + x^2 = 600\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n300 + 35x + x^2 = 600\n\nNow, I'll move 600 to the left side to set the equation to zero:\n\nx^2 + 35x + 300 - 600 = 0\n\nSo, x^2 + 35x - 300 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x^2 + 35x - 300 = 0\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = 35, and c = -300.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = 35^2 - 4*1*(-300) = 1225 + 1200 = 2425\n\nNow, sqrt(2425) is... let me calculate that. 2425 is 49^2, which is 2401, and 50^2 is 2500. So, sqrt(2425) is between 49 and 50. Let me see, 49.2^2 = 2420.64, and 49.3^2 = 2430.49. So, sqrt(2425) is approximately 49.24.\n\nSo, x = [-35 \u00b1 49.24] / 2\n\nFirst, x = (-35 + 49.24)/2 = (14.24)/2 = 7.12 meters\n\nSecond, x = (-35 - 49.24)/2 = (-84.24)/2 = -42.12 meters\n\nNow, since we're talking about extending the garden, x can't be negative. So, x = 7.12 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new length is 20 + 7.12 = 27.12 meters, and the new width is 15 + 7.12 = 22.12 meters.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. New area should be 27.12 * 22.12, which should be around 600 square meters.\n\nLet me multiply 27.12 by 22.12.\n\nFirst, 27 * 22 = 594\n\nThen, 27 * 0.12 = 3.24\n\n22 * 0.12 = 2.64\n\nAnd 0.12 * 0.12 = 0.0144\n\nSo, total is 594 + 3.24 + 2.64 + 0.0144 = 599.8944, which is approximately 600 square meters. So, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to approach this problem. Let's see.\n\nWe have the original area is 20 * 15 = 300 square meters, and we want to double it to 600 square meters.\n\nWe're extending both length and width by the same amount, x.\n\nSo, (20 + x)(15 + x) = 600\n\nExpanding, 300 + 35x + x^2 = 600\n\nThen, x^2 + 35x - 300 = 0\n\nThat's the same quadratic equation as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor this equation.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -300 and add up to 35.\n\nLet's see, possible factor pairs of -300:\n\n1 and -300\n\n2 and -150\n\n3 and -100\n\n4 and -75\n\n5 and -60\n\n6 and -50\n\n10 and -30\n\n12 and -25\n\n15 and -20\n\nLooking for two numbers among these that add up to 35.\n\nHmm, -15 and 20: -15 + 20 = 5, not 35.\n\nHow about 40 and -7.5: 40 + (-7.5) = 32.5, not 35.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the quadratic formula, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can complete the square.\n\nStarting with x^2 + 35x - 300 = 0\n\nMove the constant term: x^2 + 35x = 300\n\nNow, to complete the square, add (35/2)^2 to both sides.\n\n(35/2)^2 = (35/2)*(35/2) = 1225/4 = 306.25\n\nSo, x^2 + 35x + 306.25 = 300 + 306.25\n\nThat's x^2 + 35x + 306.25 = 606.25\n\nNow, the left side is (x + 35/2)^2 = (x + 17.5)^2\n\nSo, (x + 17.5)^2 = 606.25\n\nTake square roots: x + 17.5 = \u00b1sqrt(606.25)\n\nSqrt(606.25) is 24.625\n\nSo, x + 17.5 = 24.625 or x + 17.5 = -24.625\n\nThen, x = 24.625 - 17.5 = 7.125 meters\n\nOr x = -24.625 - 17.5 = -42.125 meters\n\nAgain, discarding the negative solution, x = 7.125 meters\n\nSo, the new dimensions are 20 + 7.125 = 27.125 meters and 15 + 7.125 = 22.125 meters\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to solve this without using quadratic equations, but I think for this problem, a quadratic equation is the way to go.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach.\n\nSuppose I let the extension be x meters, as before.\n\nThen, the new length is 20 + x, and the new width is 15 + x.\n\nTheir product is (20 + x)(15 + x) = 600\n\nExpanding, 300 + 35x + x^2 = 600\n\nWhich again gives x^2 + 35x - 300 = 0\n\nI end up with the same quadratic equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up the problem differently.\n\nLet me think about the ratio of the extensions.\n\nSince both length and width are extended by the same amount, the increment is equal in meters, but not in proportion.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of proportions.\n\nLet me consider the original dimensions: 20 meters by 15 meters.\n\nThe ratio is 20:15, which simplifies to 4:3.\n\nIf I want to maintain the same aspect ratio, but double the area, how would that work?\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't say to maintain the same aspect ratio, although originally the garden is rectangular, and we're extending both sides by the same amount, which won't necessarily maintain the aspect ratio.\n\nWait, in this case, the original aspect ratio is 20:15 = 4:3.\n\nAfter extension, the new dimensions are 20 + x and 15 + x, so the new ratio is (20 + x):(15 + x), which is not necessarily 4:3 unless x is chosen such that (20 + x)/(15 + x) = 4/3.\n\nLet me solve that.\n\nSet (20 + x)/(15 + x) = 4/3\n\nCross-multiplying: 3(20 + x) = 4(15 + x)\n\n60 + 3x = 60 + 4x\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides: 3x = 4x\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: 0 = x\n\nSo, the only solution is x = 0, which means no extension, which doesn't make sense in this context because we're supposed to extend the garden.\n\nSo, maintaining the aspect ratio would only be possible without extending, which isn't helpful.\n\nTherefore, the aspect ratio changes after extension.\n\nGoing back to the quadratic equation approach, I think that's the most straightforward method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use calculus or some other method, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nLet me consider estimating the value of x.\n\nI know that x is positive, and from earlier calculations, it's approximately 7.12 meters.\n\nLet me try x = 7 meters.\n\nNew dimensions: 20 + 7 = 27 meters and 15 + 7 = 22 meters\n\nArea: 27 * 22 = 594 square meters, which is less than 600.\n\nSo, x needs to be a bit more than 7 meters.\n\nTry x = 7.2 meters.\n\n20 + 7.2 = 27.2 meters\n\n15 + 7.2 = 22.2 meters\n\nArea: 27.2 * 22.2 = let's calculate that.\n\n27 * 22 = 594\n\n27 * 0.2 = 5.4\n\n22 * 0.2 = 4.4\n\n0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\nTotal: 594 + 5.4 + 4.4 + 0.04 = 603.84, which is more than 600.\n\nSo, x is between 7 and 7.2 meters.\n\nLet me try x = 7.1 meters.\n\n20 + 7.1 = 27.1 meters\n\n15 + 7.1 = 22.1 meters\n\nArea: 27.1 * 22.1 = ?\n\n27 * 22 = 594\n\n27 * 0.1 = 2.7\n\n22 * 0.1 = 2.2\n\n0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01\n\nTotal: 594 + 2.7 + 2.2 + 0.01 = 598.91, which is less than 600.\n\nSo, x is between 7.1 and 7.2 meters.\n\nTry x = 7.15 meters.\n\n20 + 7.15 = 27.15 meters\n\n15 + 7.15 = 22.15 meters\n\nArea: 27.15 * 22.15 = ?\n\n27 * 22 = 594\n\n27 * 0.15 = 4.05\n\n22 * 0.15 = 3.3\n\n0.15 * 0.15 = 0.0225\n\nTotal: 594 + 4.05 + 3.3 + 0.0225 = 601.3725, which is more than 600.\n\nSo, x is between 7.1 and 7.15 meters.\n\nI can continue this process to get a more precise value, but for practical purposes, x \u2248 7.12 meters is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions are approximately 27.12 meters in length and 22.12 meters in width.\n\nAlternatively, to express it in fractions or exact values, from the quadratic formula, x = [-35 + sqrt(2425)] / 2\n\nSimplify sqrt(2425):\n\n2425 = 25 * 97\n\nSo, sqrt(2425) = sqrt(25*97) = 5*sqrt(97)\n\nTherefore, x = [-35 + 5*sqrt(97)] / 2\n\nCalculate sqrt(97):\n\n97 is between 96.04 (9.8^2) and 100 (10^2). More precisely, 9.85^2 = 97.0225, so sqrt(97) \u2248 9.8489\n\nThus, x \u2248 [-35 + 5*9.8489]/2 = [-35 + 49.2445]/2 = (14.2445)/2 \u2248 7.1222 meters\n\nSo, x \u2248 7.1222 meters\n\nTherefore, new length \u2248 20 + 7.1222 = 27.1222 meters\n\nNew width \u2248 15 + 7.1222 = 22.1222 meters\n\nWhich matches my earlier approximation.\n\nAlternatively, for exact value, x = [-35 + sqrt(2425)] / 2\n\nSo, new length = 20 + [-35 + sqrt(2425)] / 2 = [20*2 -35 + sqrt(2425)] / 2 = [40 -35 + sqrt(2425)] / 2 = [5 + sqrt(2425)] / 2 meters\n\nSimilarly, new width = 15 + [-35 + sqrt(2425)] / 2 = [30 -35 + sqrt(2425)] / 2 = [-5 + sqrt(2425)] / 2 meters\n\nBut the decimal approximation is more practical for real-world applications.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions of the garden will be approximately 27.12 meters in length and 22.12 meters in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe new dimensions of the garden are \\boxed{27.12 \\text{ meters by } 22.12 \\text{ meters}}"
