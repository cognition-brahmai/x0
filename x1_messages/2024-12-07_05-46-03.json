        "content": "(Verse 1)\nIn the belly of the storm, where the waves conspire,\nLies a sailor, lost in the briny empire.\nHis ship, a ghostly whisper on the wind,\nDrifts on, alone, where the deep blue begins.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, the sea is a cruel mistress, she takes what she wants,\nLeaves the sailor adrift, with naught but his thoughts.\nYearning for the shore, for the touch of land,\nBut the ocean's vast expanse, holds him in its hand.\n\n(Verse 2)\nThe moon casts its silver light on the endless sea,\nA solitary beacon, yet so far, can't you see?\nThe sailor calls out, his voice lost in the roar,\nOf the waves that crash, forevermore.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, the sea is a merciless queen, she claims her own,\nThe sailor drifts, a mere pawn, in her game unknown.\nHe longs for the warmth of home, the love he left behind,\nBut the ocean's call is strong, his fate, hard to find.\n\n(Bridge)\nThe stars above twinkle, cold and distant,\nGuiding lights, yet so relentless.\nThe sailor wonders, if he'll ever be free,\nFrom the ocean's grip, wild and decree.\n\n(Verse 3)\nThe sea birds circle, crying out their mournful song,\nEchoes of despair, all day long.\nThe sailor listens, to their laments so pure,\nIn their voices, he hears his own cure.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, the sea is a siren's song, sweet and deceitful,\nLuring the sailor, to his inevitable defeat.\nHe dreams of the harbor, safe and sound,\nBut the ocean's power, surrounds.\n\n(Outro)\nSo here he remains, a mariner lost at sea,\nA tale of solitude, for all to see.\nThe ocean, his grave, his final rest,\nA haunting folk song, never to be the best."
