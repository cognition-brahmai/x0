Here's a simple Python script that takes a string as input and reverses the order of the words in it.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(input_string):\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = input_string.split()\n    \n    # Reverse the list of words\n    reversed_words = words[::-1]\n    \n    # Join the reversed words back into a string\n    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n    \n    return reversed_string\n\n# Take input from the user\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n\n# Reverse the words and print the result\nreversed_string = reverse_words(input_string)\nprint(\"Reversed string:\", reversed_string)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Split the String:** We use the `split()` method to break the input string into a list of words.\n2. **Reverse the List:** We use slicing `[::-1]` to reverse the list of words.\n3. **Join the Words:** We use the `join()` method to combine the reversed list of words back into a single string.\n4. **User Input and Output:** We take input from the user, process it using the `reverse_words` function, and print the reversed string.\n\nYou can run this script in any Python environment. Just copy the code, paste it into a Python file (e.g., `reverse_words.py`), and run it. The script will prompt you to enter a string, and it will display the string with the words reversed."
