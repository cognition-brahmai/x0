        "content": "So I've got this problem here: an office building with 20 floors, each floor has 15 rooms, and each room has 4 windows. I need to find out how many windows there are in the entire building. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should break down the problem into smaller parts. Starting from the smallest unit, which is a window, and then go up to rooms, floors, and finally the whole building.\n\nSo, each room has 4 windows. If there are 15 rooms on each floor, then the number of windows on one floor would be the number of rooms multiplied by the number of windows per room. That is, 15 rooms/floor \u00d7 4 windows/room.\n\nLet me calculate that: 15 \u00d7 4 = 60 windows per floor.\n\nNow, there are 20 floors in the building. So, to find the total number of windows in the entire building, I need to multiply the number of windows per floor by the number of floors. That would be 60 windows/floor \u00d7 20 floors.\n\nCalculating that: 60 \u00d7 20.\n\nWell, 60 \u00d7 20 is 1200.\n\nSo, there are 1200 windows in the entire building.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should verify this step by step.\n\nFirst, rooms per floor: 15.\n\nWindows per room: 4.\n\nSo, windows per floor: 15 \u00d7 4 = 60.\n\nFloors: 20.\n\nTotal windows: 60 \u00d7 20 = 1200.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of rooms in the building multiplied by the number of windows per room.\n\nTotal rooms: 20 floors \u00d7 15 rooms/floor = 300 rooms.\n\nThen, total windows: 300 rooms \u00d7 4 windows/room = 1200 windows.\n\nSame answer again, which reinforces that 1200 is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the multiplication of all the units:\n\n20 floors \u00d7 15 rooms/floor \u00d7 4 windows/room = ?\n\nFirst, 20 \u00d7 15 = 300.\n\nThen, 300 \u00d7 4 = 1200.\n\nOr, 20 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 4 = 1200.\n\nEither way, it's 1200 windows.\n\nI think that's the accurate total number of windows in the building.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
