        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing soccer and basketball. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 40 students in total. Out of these, 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 12 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try.\n\nFirst, I know that if some students play both sports, they are counted in both the soccer and basketball groups. So, to find out how many students play at least one of the sports, I need to add the number of soccer and basketball players and then subtract those who play both, so I don't double-count them.\n\nSo, the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\nNumber playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both.\n\nThat would be 18 + 20 - 12 = 26 students.\n\nNow, since there are 40 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be:\n\nTotal students - students playing at least one sport = 40 - 26 = 14 students.\n\nWait, but I remember that there's a formula for this kind of thing. It's about the union of two sets. The formula is:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A \u222a B) is the number of students playing either soccer or basketball.\n\n- n(A) is the number playing soccer.\n\n- n(B) is the number playing basketball.\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number playing both.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = 18 + 20 - 12 = 26\n\nAnd then, the number of students who don't play either sport is the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport:\n\n40 - 26 = 14\n\nThat seems straightforward. But just to make sure, maybe I should think about it another way.\n\nLet's consider the students who play only soccer, only basketball, and both.\n\n- Only soccer: 18 (total soccer) - 12 (both) = 6\n\n- Only basketball: 20 (total basketball) - 12 (both) = 8\n\n- Both sports: 12\n\nSo, the total number of students playing at least one sport is 6 + 8 + 12 = 26\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total number of students: 40 - 26 = 14\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. I think I'm on the right track.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle. That's similar to what I did earlier, where I include the totals for each sport and then exclude the overlap.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the students who don't play soccer and don't play basketball.\n\nThe number of students who don't play soccer is total students minus those who play soccer: 40 - 18 = 22\n\nThe number who don't play basketball is 40 - 20 = 20\n\nBut if I add those, I get 22 + 20 = 42, which is more than the total number of students, which doesn't make sense. That's because some students are being counted twice, those who don't play either sport.\n\nTo find the number who don't play either, I need to subtract those who play both sports from this total.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nActually, the inclusion-exclusion principle can be applied to the complement as well.\n\nThe number of students who don't play either sport is equal to the total number minus those who play soccer or basketball.\n\nWhich is:\n\nTotal - (soccer or basketball) = 40 - (18 + 20 - 12) = 40 - 26 = 14\n\nSo, again, 14 students don't play either sport.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways now. I feel confident that the answer is 14.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are students who play other sports, but the problem only mentions soccer and basketball, and I'm supposed to find those who don't play either of these sports.\n\nAssuming that there are no other sports involved, and that the only sports mentioned are soccer and basketball, my calculation should hold.\n\nOne last thing: I should make sure that the numbers make sense.\n\nTotal students: 40\n\nPlaying only soccer: 6\n\nPlaying only basketball: 8\n\nPlaying both: 12\n\nTotal playing at least one sport: 6 + 8 + 12 = 26\n\nNot playing any sport: 40 - 26 = 14\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've answered the question correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
