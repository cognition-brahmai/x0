        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. Developing a simple HTTP server in Go that handles GET requests at the \"/status\" route and returns a JSON response with a status message and the current server time is straightforward. We'll use Go's standard libraries for this task, specifically the `net/http` package for the server and `time` package to get the current time.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/). After installing Go, set up your workspace according to the Go documentation.\n\nNow, let's create a new Go file for our server. You can name it `main.go`.\n\nOpen `main.go` in your favorite text editor and start by importing the necessary packages:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n```\n\nNext, we'll define a struct to hold the response data. This struct will have two fields: `Message` for the status message and `Time` for the current server time.\n\n```go\ntype StatusResponse struct {\n\tMessage string    `json:\"message\"`\n\tTime    time.Time `json:\"time\"`\n}\n```\n\nNow, we'll create a handler function for the \"/status\" route. This function will be called whenever a GET request is made to this route. Inside the handler, we'll create an instance of `StatusResponse`, set the message to \"Server is up and running\", and the time to the current server time. Then, we'll encode this struct to JSON and write it as the response body.\n\n```go\nfunc statusHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tif r.Method != http.MethodGet {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Method Not Allowed\", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tresponse := StatusResponse{\n\t\tMessage: \"Server is up and running\",\n\t\tTime:    time.Now(),\n\t}\n\n\tw.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n\tjson.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)\n}\n```\n\nIn the handler, we first check if the request method is GET. If not, we return a 405 Method Not Allowed error. Then, we create a `StatusResponse` object with the desired message and current time. We set the Content-Type header to \"application/json\" and encode the response object to JSON, writing it to the response writer.\n\nNext, we'll set up the HTTP server and register the handler for the \"/status\" route.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/status\", statusHandler)\n\n\tport := \"8080\"\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Starting server on port %s\\n\", port)\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(\":\"+port, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Could not start server: %s\\n\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn the `main` function, we use `http.HandleFunc` to register the `statusHandler` function to handle requests to the \"/status\" path. We then specify the port number (in this case, \"8080\") and start the server using `http.ListenAndServe`. If there's an error starting the server, we log it and exit the program.\n\nThat's the basic structure of your HTTP server. You can run the server by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\n```\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nOnce the server is running, you can test it by visiting `http://localhost:8080/status` in your web browser or by using a tool like curl:\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/status\n```\n\nYou should see a JSON response similar to:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"message\": \"Server is up and running\",\n\t\"time\": \"2023-04-01T12:34:56.789Z\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that the time will be in UTC format by default. If you want to include the location or format the time differently, you can adjust the `Time` field in the `StatusResponse` struct accordingly.\n\nThis is a very basic server and for production use, you might want to add more features such as handling different HTTP methods, error handling, logging, and possibly using a more robust HTTP server library like Gorilla Mux for routing.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with your Go HTTP server!
