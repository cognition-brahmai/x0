        "content": "So John has twice as many apples as Mary, and Mary has 15 apples. I need to find out how many apples they have together.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many apples John has. Since he has twice as many as Mary, and Mary has 15, I can calculate John's apples by multiplying Mary's apples by 2.\n\nSo, John's apples = 2 * Mary's apples = 2 * 15 = 30 apples.\n\nNow, to find out how many apples they have together, I need to add John's apples and Mary's apples together.\n\nTotal apples = John's apples + Mary's apples = 30 + 15 = 45 apples.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to make sure I'm correct?\n\nAlternatively, since John has twice as many apples as Mary, together they should have Mary's amount plus two times Mary's amount, which is three times Mary's amount.\n\nSo, total apples = 3 * Mary's apples = 3 * 15 = 45 apples.\n\nThat matches my first calculation, so I'm confident the answer is 45.\n\nLet me just double-check. If Mary has 15 apples and John has twice that, which is 30, then together they have 15 + 30 = 45.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
