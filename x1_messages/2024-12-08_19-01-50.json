        "content": "Let's see. There's this snail in a 30-foot well, and every day it climbs up 5 feet but then slides back down 4 feet. I need to find out how many days it takes for the snail to reach the top.\n\nFirst, I should understand what happens each day. So, during the day, the snail climbs up 5 feet, and then at night, it slides back down 4 feet. That means each full day, the snail makes a net progress of 5 - 4 = 1 foot.\n\nIf that's the case, then it seems like the snail is making 1 foot of progress each day. So, for a 30-foot well, it should take 30 days to reach the top, right?\n\nBut wait, I should think about that again. Let's consider what happens on the last day. On the last day, when the snail climbs up 5 feet, maybe it reaches the top before sliding back down. So, perhaps on the last day, it doesn't slide back down.\n\nLet me think about that. Suppose the snail is at a certain height just before the last day. If it climbs up 5 feet and reaches or surpasses the top, then it would have escaped the well without sliding back down.\n\nSo, I need to find out on which day the snail's climb takes it to or above the top of the well.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nEach day, the snail's net progress is 1 foot, except for the last day.\n\nSo, if the well is 30 feet deep, and the snail needs to reach 30 feet.\n\nLet's see, if the snail climbs 5 feet during the day and slides back 4 feet at night, then the net is +1 foot per day.\n\nBut on the final day, it climbs 5 feet and doesn't slide back, because it has reached the top.\n\nSo, I need to find out after how many days the snail's position, after climbing during the day, is at or above 30 feet.\n\nLet me consider that each day, the snail effectively moves up 1 foot (5 - 4 = 1), but on the last day, it moves up 5 feet without sliding back.\n\nSo, perhaps I can think of it as the snail needs to be within 5 feet of the top at the start of a day, so that when it climbs 5 feet, it reaches or surpasses 30 feet.\n\nLet me calculate how many days it takes for the snail to be at or beyond 25 feet, because on the next day, it can climb 5 feet and reach 30 feet.\n\nWait, the well is 30 feet deep.\n\nSo, if the snail is at 25 feet at the start of a day, it climbs 5 feet to reach 30 feet, and that's the top.\n\nSo, it would have reached the top without sliding back down.\n\nBut, before that, each day it makes a net progress of 1 foot.\n\nSo, to reach 25 feet, it would take 25 days, because starting from 0, after 25 days, it would have climbed 25 feet (1 foot per day).\n\nThen, on the 26th day, it climbs 5 feet, reaching 30 feet, and escapes.\n\nSo, the answer seems to be 26 days.\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nDay 1: climbs +5, slides -4, net +1, position = 1 foot\n\nDay 2: climbs +5, slides -4, net +1, position = 2 feet\n\n...\n\nDay 25: position = 25 feet\n\nDay 26: climbs +5, reaches 30 feet, escapes.\n\nSo, yes, on the 26th day, it reaches the top.\n\nBut wait, what if the snail is at 25 feet at the start of day 26, climbs 5 feet to reach 30 feet, but does it slide back down?\n\nNo, once it reaches the top, it doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, 26 days is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each day it makes a net progress of 1 foot, but on the last day, it makes 5 feet without sliding back.\n\nSo, total progress is 25 feet with net +1 per day for 25 days, plus 5 feet on the 26th day.\n\nTotal: 25 + 5 = 30 feet.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the well was, say, 31 feet, then:\n\nAfter 25 days: 25 feet.\n\nDay 26: climbs to 30 feet, but hasn't reached 31 feet yet, so slides back down to 30 - 4 = 26 feet.\n\nDay 27: climbs to 26 + 5 = 31 feet, escapes without sliding back.\n\nSo, 27 days for a 31-foot well.\n\nSimilarly, for 30 feet, 26 days.\n\nWait, but in the 31-foot well, on day 26, it climbs to 30 feet, slides back to 26 feet, and then on day 27, climbs to 31 feet and escapes.\n\nBut in the 30-foot well, on day 26, it climbs to 30 feet and escapes.\n\nSo, yes, 26 days for a 30-foot well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a general formula.\n\nLet the well depth be D, daily climb be C, and nightly slide be S.\n\nEach day, net progress is C - S, except the last day.\n\nSo, the snail needs to reach D feet.\n\nLet me denote the number of days as N.\n\nThen, after N-1 days, the snail has climbed (C - S) * (N - 1) feet.\n\nOn the Nth day, it climbs C feet, reaching (C - S)*(N - 1) + C feet.\n\nThis needs to be at least D feet.\n\nSo, (C - S)*(N - 1) + C >= D.\n\nSolve for N.\n\n(C - S)*(N - 1) + C >= D\n\n(C - S)*N - (C - S) + C >= D\n\n(C - S)*N + (C - (C - S)) >= D\n\n(C - S)*N + S >= D\n\n(C - S)*N >= D - S\n\nN >= (D - S)/(C - S)\n\nNow, plugging in D = 30, C = 5, S = 4:\n\nN >= (30 - 4)/(5 - 4) = 26/1 = 26 days.\n\nSo, N >= 26 days.\n\nSince N must be an integer, N = 26 days.\n\nWait, but in the general formula, it's N >= (D - S)/(C - S).\n\nBut in this case, C - S = 1, and D - S = 26, so N >= 26.\n\nSo, N = 26 days.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the snail needs to reach or surpass the top in one climb without sliding back.\n\nSo, if the snail is at position P at the start of a day, and P + C >= D, then it escapes on that day.\n\nSo, P + C >= D => P >= D - C.\n\nIn this case, D = 30, C = 5, so P >= 25.\n\nSo, the snail needs to be at position 25 or higher at the start of a day to escape on that day.\n\nNow, how many days does it take to reach position 25?\n\nEach day, net progress is 1 foot, starting from 0.\n\nSo, to reach 25 feet, it takes 25 days.\n\nThen, on the 26th day, it climbs 5 feet to reach 30 feet and escapes.\n\nHence, 26 days.\n\nAlternatively, think about it in terms of the general formula.\n\nN = ceil( (D - C)/(C - S) ) + 1\n\nWhere ceil is the ceiling function, which rounds up to the next integer.\n\nPlugging in D = 30, C = 5, S = 4:\n\nN = ceil( (30 - 5)/(5 - 4) ) + 1 = ceil(25/1) + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26 days.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that the snail needs to cover D - C feet with net progress of C - S per day, and then on the last day, climb C feet to reach the top.\n\nSo, days to cover D - C feet: (D - C)/(C - S)\n\nThen, total days: (D - C)/(C - S) + 1\n\nAgain, with D = 30, C = 5, S = 4:\n\n(30 - 5)/(5 - 4) + 1 = 25/1 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26 days.\n\nSo, all these methods lead to the same conclusion: it takes 26 days for the snail to reach the top of the well.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]"
