        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that there's a standard deck of 52 cards, and if you draw 5 cards from the deck, what's the probability that they will all be hearts? And I need to show my work.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember some basics about probability. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are getting all 5 hearts, and the total outcomes are all possible ways to draw 5 cards from the deck.\n\nNow, a standard deck has 52 cards, and there are 13 hearts in it because there are 13 cards in each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. So, there are 13 hearts out of 52 cards.\n\nSince I'm drawing 5 cards, and I want all of them to be hearts, I need to figure out how many ways I can choose 5 hearts from the 13 available, and then divide that by the total number of ways to choose any 5 cards from the entire deck of 52.\n\nThis sounds like a combination problem because the order in which I draw the cards doesn't matter. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 5 hearts from 13 is denoted as C(13,5), and the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52 is C(52,5).\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, first I'll calculate C(13,5):\n\nC(13,5) = 13! / (5!(13 - 5)!) = (13!)/(5! * 8!)\n\nI don't need to calculate the full factorials because a lot of terms will cancel out.\n\n13! is 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!\n\nSo, C(13,5) = (13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (5! \u00d7 8!))\n\nThe 8! in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so it simplifies to:\n\n(13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / 5!\n\nNow, 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nSo, C(13,5) = (13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / 120\n\nI can calculate the numerator:\n\n13 \u00d7 12 = 156\n\n156 \u00d7 11 = 1716\n\n1716 \u00d7 10 = 17160\n\n17160 \u00d7 9 = 154440\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n154440 / 120 = 1287\n\nSo, there are 1287 ways to choose 5 hearts from 13.\n\nNext, I need to find the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52, which is C(52,5):\n\nC(52,5) = 52! / (5!(52 - 5)!) = (52!)/(5! * 47!)\n\nAgain, I can simplify this:\n\n52! is 52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 47!\n\nSo, C(52,5) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 47!) / (5! \u00d7 47!))\n\nThe 47! cancels out:\n\n(52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / 5!\n\n5! is 120, as before.\n\nSo, C(52,5) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / 120\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n52 \u00d7 51 = 2652\n\n2652 \u00d7 50 = 132600\n\n132600 \u00d7 49 = 6507400\n\n6507400 \u00d7 48 = 312355200\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n312355200 / 120 = 2602960\n\nSo, there are 2,602,960 ways to choose any 5 cards from the deck.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = C(13,5) / C(52,5) = 1287 / 2,602,960\n\nI can simplify this fraction. Let's see if 1287 and 2,602,960 have any common factors.\n\nFirst, check if 1287 is divisible by any small numbers.\n\n1287 \u00f7 3 = 429, because 1 + 2 + 8 + 7 = 18, which is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, 1287 = 3 \u00d7 429\n\nSimilarly, 429 \u00f7 3 = 143, because 4 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, 1287 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 143 = 9 \u00d7 143\n\nNow, 143 seems divisible by 11: 143 \u00f7 11 = 13\n\nSo, 143 = 11 \u00d7 13\n\nTherefore, 1287 = 9 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13\n\nNow, let's factorize 2,602,960.\n\nFirst, it's even, so divide by 2: 2,602,960 \u00f7 2 = 1,301,480\n\nDivide by 2 again: 1,301,480 \u00f7 2 = 650,740\n\nDivide by 2 again: 650,740 \u00f7 2 = 325,370\n\nDivide by 2 again: 325,370 \u00f7 2 = 162,685\n\nNow, 162,685 is divisible by 5: 162,685 \u00f7 5 = 32,537\n\nNow, 32,537 seems divisible by 13: 32,537 \u00f7 13 = 2,503\n\nSo, 32,537 = 13 \u00d7 2,503\n\nNow, 2,503 seems like a prime number, but let's check.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 7 \u2248 357.57, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 11 \u2248 227.545, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 13 \u2248 192.538, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 17 \u2248 147.235, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 19 \u2248 131.736, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 23 \u2248 108.826, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 29 \u2248 86.31, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 31 \u2248 80.741, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 37 \u2248 67.648, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 41 \u2248 61.048, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 43 \u2248 58.209, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 53 \u2248 47.226, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 59 \u2248 42.423, not an integer.\n\n2,503 \u00f7 61 \u2248 41.032, not an integer.\n\nSo, 2,503 is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 2,602,960 is:\n\n2^4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 2,503\n\nAnd the prime factorization of 1287 is:\n\n3^2 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13\n\nSo, the common factor between 1287 and 2,602,960 is 13.\n\nTherefore, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 13:\n\n1287 \u00f7 13 = 99\n\n2,602,960 \u00f7 13 = 200,228\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 99 / 200,228\n\nNow, check if 99 and 200,228 have any common factors.\n\n99 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11\n\n200,228 \u00f7 3 = 66,742.666, not an integer.\n\n200,228 \u00f7 11 = 18,202.545, not an integer.\n\nSo, no common factors.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 99 / 200,228.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\nSo, 99 \u00f7 200,228 \u2248 0.000494\n\nTo express this in terms of odds, I can say it's approximately 0.0494%.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing 5 hearts from a standard deck of 52 cards is about 0.0494%.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this probability in terms of odds against it happening.\n\nThe odds against drawing 5 hearts are (1 - probability) / probability = (1 - 0.000494) / 0.000494 \u2248 200,228 / 99 \u2248 2022.5\n\nSo, the odds are about 2022 to 1 against drawing 5 hearts.\n\nAlternatively, the probability can also be expressed using combinations.\n\nAnother way to think about it is the probability of drawing a heart on the first draw, then another heart on the second draw given that the first was a heart, and so on, up to five draws.\n\nThe probability of drawing a heart first is 13/52 = 1/4.\n\nGiven that the first card was a heart, there are now 12 hearts left and 51 cards left, so the probability of drawing another heart is 12/51.\n\nThen, if the second was a heart, there are 11 hearts left and 50 cards left, so 11/50.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nThird draw: 10/49\n\nFourth draw: 9/48\n\nFifth draw: 8/47\n\nSo, the overall probability is:\n\n(13/52) \u00d7 (12/51) \u00d7 (11/50) \u00d7 (10/49) \u00d7 (9/48)\n\nSimplifying each fraction:\n\n13/52 = 1/4\n\n12/51 = 4/17\n\n11/50 = 11/50\n\n10/49 = 10/49\n\n9/48 = 3/16\n\nNow, multiply these together:\n\n(1/4) \u00d7 (4/17) \u00d7 (11/50) \u00d7 (10/49) \u00d7 (3/16)\n\nFirst, notice that the 4 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\n(1) \u00d7 (1/17) \u00d7 (11/50) \u00d7 (10/49) \u00d7 (3/16)\n\nNow, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n\nNumerator: 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 3 = 330\n\nDenominator: 1 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 16\n\nCalculate the denominator:\n\n17 \u00d7 50 = 850\n\n850 \u00d7 49 = 41,650\n\n41,650 \u00d7 16 = 666,400\n\nSo, the probability is 330 / 666,400\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 10:\n\n33 / 66,640\n\nNow, check if 33 and 66,640 have any common factors.\n\n33 = 3 \u00d7 11\n\n66,640 \u00f7 3 = 22,213.333, not an integer.\n\n66,640 \u00f7 11 = 6,058.1818, not an integer.\n\nSo, no common factors.\n\nTherefore, 33 / 66,640 is the simplified fraction.\n\nBut earlier, I had 99 / 200,228.\n\nWait a minute, these two fractions should be equal.\n\nLet's check:\n\n99 / 200,228 \u00f7 3 = 33 / 66,742.666, which doesn't match 33 / 66,640.\n\nHmm, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the denominator earlier.\n\nLet me recalculate the denominator:\n\n17 \u00d7 50 = 850\n\n850 \u00d7 49 = 41,650\n\n41,650 \u00d7 16 = 666,400\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, comparing 33 / 66,640 and 99 / 200,228.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier method using combinations.\n\nLet me check C(13,5) and C(52,5).\n\nC(13,5) = 1287, as calculated before.\n\nC(52,5) = 2,598,960.\n\nWait, earlier I had C(52,5) = 2,602,960, but that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated C(52,5).\n\nLet me recalculate C(52,5):\n\nC(52,5) = 52! / (5! \u00d7 47!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / 120\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652\n\n2,652 \u00d7 50 = 132,600\n\n132,600 \u00d7 49 = 6,500,400\n\n6,500,400 \u00d7 48 = 312,019,200\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n312,019,200 / 120 = 2,600,160\n\nWait, but according to standard values, C(52,5) is 2,598,960.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652\n\n2,652 \u00d7 50 = 132,600\n\n132,600 \u00d7 49 = 6,500,400\n\n6,500,400 \u00d7 48 = 312,019,200\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n312,019,200 \u00f7 120 = 2,600,160\n\nBut standard value is 2,598,960.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the correct value, which is 2,598,960.\n\nSo, C(52,5) = 2,598,960\n\nNow, probability = C(13,5) / C(52,5) = 1287 / 2,598,960\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1287 and 2,598,960.\n\nFrom earlier, 1287 = 3^2 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13\n\nNow, 2,598,960 \u00f7 13 = 199,920\n\nSo, 13 is a common factor.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 13:\n\n1287 \u00f7 13 = 99\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 13 = 199,920\n\nSo, the fraction is 99 / 199,920\n\nNow, simplify 99 and 199,920.\n\n99 = 3^2 \u00d7 11\n\n199,920 \u00f7 3 = 66,640\n\n66,640 \u00f7 3 = 22,213.333, not an integer.\n\nSo, only one 3 is divisible.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the prime factors of 199,920.\n\n199,920 \u00f7 3 = 66,640\n\n66,640 \u00f7 3 = 22,213.333, not an integer.\n\nSo, only one 3 is a common factor.\n\nTherefore, divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n99 \u00f7 3 = 33\n\n199,920 \u00f7 3 = 66,640\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 33 / 66,640\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation of 33 / 66,640.\n\nSo, the probability is 33 / 66,640, which is approximately 0.0004952, or 0.04952%.\n\nAlternatively, this can be expressed as about 1 in 2,019.4.\n\nSo, the odds are about 2,019 to 1 against drawing 5 hearts.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{66640}} \\]\n\nOr approximately \\( 0.0004952 \\), which is roughly 0.04952%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{66640}} \\]"
