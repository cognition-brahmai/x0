        "content": "So in this problem, we have a town where 25% of the population owns cats, 15% owns dogs, and 5% owns both cats and dogs. We need to find out what percentage of the population doesn't own either a cat or a dog.\n\nFirst, I think I should visualize this to understand better. Maybe a Venn diagram would help here. So, imagine two circles overlapping each other: one circle for cat owners and another for dog owners.\n\nThe cat owners' circle is 25%, the dog owners' circle is 15%, and the overlapping part where both circles meet is 5%, since those are the people who own both cats and dogs.\n\nNow, to find out the total percentage of people who own either a cat or a dog or both, I need to add the percentages of cat owners and dog owners but subtract the overlap because those people are counted in both groups.\n\nSo, total percentage of pet owners is:\n\n25% (cats) + 15% (dogs) - 5% (both) = 35% - 5% = 30%.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that.\n\nActually, the formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nNumber of people who own cats or dogs = number who own cats + number who own dogs - number who own both.\n\nSo, it's 25% + 15% - 5% = 35% - 5% = 30%.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 30% of the population owns either a cat or a dog or both.\n\nNow, to find out who doesn't own either, I think I need to subtract this 30% from the total population, which is 100%.\n\nSo, 100% - 30% = 70%.\n\nTherefore, 70% of the population doesn't own either a cat or a dog.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any possibility that some people own other pets that aren't cats or dogs? The problem doesn't mention anything about other pets, so I assume that only cats and dogs are being considered here.\n\nAlso, the 5% who own both cats and dogs are correctly subtracted to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 70% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70\\%} \\]"
