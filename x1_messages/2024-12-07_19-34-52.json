        "content": "So, you're driving at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes, and you want to know how far you'll travel. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\n\\]\n\nSo, speed is 50 miles per hour, and time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. But, I need to make sure that the units are compatible. That is, since speed is in miles per hour, time should be in hours.\n\nNow, 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2.5 hours, right? Because 30 minutes is half an hour, so 2 plus 0.5 equals 2.5 hours.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = 50 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying that out:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = 125 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the time conversion. 30 minutes is indeed 0.5 hours, so 2 hours plus 0.5 hours is 2.5 hours. And 50 times 2.5 is definitely 125.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in parts. In 2 hours at 50 miles per hour, you would cover:\n\n\\[\n50 \\times 2 = 100 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nThen, in 30 minutes, which is half an hour, at 50 miles per hour, you would cover:\n\n\\[\n50 \\times 0.5 = 25 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nAdding those together:\n\n\\[\n100 + 25 = 125 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nSo, yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to convert everything to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours and 30 minutes is:\n\n\\[\n(2 \\times 60) + 30 = 120 + 30 = 150 \\, \\text{minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, 50 miles per hour is equivalent to 50 miles per 60 minutes. So, to find out how many miles per minute:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\, \\text{miles}}{60 \\, \\text{minutes}} \\approx 0.833 \\, \\text{miles per minute}\n\\]\n\nThen, multiplying by 150 minutes:\n\n\\[\n0.833 \\times 150 \\approx 125 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that 125 miles is the correct distance.\n\nLet me just consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like acceleration or stops, but the problem says average speed, so I don't need to worry about that. It's assuming a constant average speed of 50 miles per hour.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correct. Speed is in miles per hour, time is in hours, so the result is in miles, which is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, the final answer is 125 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
