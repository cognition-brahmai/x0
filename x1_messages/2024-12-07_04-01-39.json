        "content": "Plants communicate with each other through a complex system of chemical signals, often using volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are released into the atmosphere. When a plant is attacked by insects or\u75c5\u83cc, it releases specific VOCs that can be detected by neighboring plants. These signals trigger defensive responses in the receiving plants, allowing them to prepare for potential attacks and enhance their resistance. This interconnected communication network helps plants coordinate their defenses and adapt to their environment more effectively.\n"
