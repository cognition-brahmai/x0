        "content": "Machu Picchu was built by the Inca civilization around 1450. It is located in Peru and was likely constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti. The site was abandoned a century later during the Spanish Conquest, and it remained unknown to the outside world until it was rediscovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham. Today, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world."
