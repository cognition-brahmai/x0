        "content": "Let's see. We have three barbers: A, B, and C, who take 15, 20, and 25 minutes per haircut, respectively. They all start cutting hair at the same time, and we need to find out how long it will take for them to complete a total of 60 haircuts.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many haircuts each barber can do in a given amount of time. Since their speeds are different, they'll complete different numbers of haircuts in the same time period.\n\nLet's denote the total time they all work as \\( t \\) minutes. Then, the number of haircuts each barber completes can be expressed as:\n\n- Barber A: \\( \\frac{t}{15} \\)\n\n- Barber B: \\( \\frac{t}{20} \\)\n\n- Barber C: \\( \\frac{t}{25} \\)\n\nThe total number of haircuts is the sum of these:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{15} + \\frac{t}{20} + \\frac{t}{25} = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( t \\). To do that, I should find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 15, 20, and 25.\n\nLet's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15, 20, and 25.\n\n- 15 factors: 3 \u00d7 5\n\n- 20 factors: 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\n\n- 25 factors: 5\u00b2\n\nThe LCM would be the highest power of each prime number present: 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\u00b2 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 25 = 300.\n\nSo, the common denominator is 300.\n\nNow, let's rewrite each fraction with denominator 300:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{15} = \\frac{20t}{300}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{20} = \\frac{15t}{300}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{25} = \\frac{12t}{300}\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20t}{300} + \\frac{15t}{300} + \\frac{12t}{300} = \\frac{47t}{300}\n\\]\n\nSet this equal to 60:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{47t}{300} = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\n47t = 60 \\times 300\n\\]\n\n\\[\n47t = 18,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{18,000}{47}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n47 times 382 is 47 \u00d7 382.\n\nFirst, 47 \u00d7 300 = 14,100\n\n47 \u00d7 80 = 3,760\n\n47 \u00d7 2 = 94\n\nAdding up: 14,100 + 3,760 = 17,860 + 94 = 17,954\n\nSo, 47 \u00d7 382 = 17,954\n\n18,000 - 17,954 = 46\n\nSo, 47 \u00d7 382 + 46 = 18,000\n\nTherefore, t = 382 minutes plus some fraction.\n\nWait, 47 \u00d7 382 = 17,954, and 18,000 - 17,954 = 46.\n\nSo, 47 \u00d7 382 + 46 = 18,000\n\nTherefore, t = 382 + 46/47 minutes.\n\nThat's approximately 382 minutes plus about 0.9787 minutes, which is almost 383 minutes.\n\nBut to be precise, t = 382 + 46/47 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, t = 382 minutes and 46/47 of a minute.\n\nSince 1 minute = 60 seconds, 46/47 minutes is (46/47) \u00d7 60 seconds.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 46/47 is approximately 0.9787 minutes.\n\n0.9787 \u00d7 60 \u2248 58.72 seconds.\n\nSo, t \u2248 382 minutes and 58.72 seconds.\n\nBut maybe we can leave it as 382 + 46/47 minutes for exactness.\n\nAlternatively, we can express t as 18,000/47 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time required for all three barbers to complete 60 haircuts is 18,000 divided by 47 minutes, which is approximately 382 minutes and 59 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{18000}{47} \\text{ minutes} \\approx 382 \\text{ minutes and } 59 \\text{ seconds}} \\]"
