The crew's morale is high, filled with anticipation to return home after years in the frigid vacuum of space.\n\nDay 7:\n\nAn unusual energy signature surfaced on our radar. It was unlike anything we had previously encountered. Intrigued, we chose to investigate.\n\nDay 9:\n\nWe discovered it. An entity - a creature of pure energy. It was beyond anything we could have envisioned. We attempted to communicate with it, but received no response.\n\nDay 10:\n\nSomething went awry. The entity attached itself to the Elysium, and systems began to fail sequentially. Initially, the communication system broke down, severing our connection with Earth. Subsequently, the navigation system failed, leaving us to drift aimlessly through space.\n\nDay 11:\n\nThe entity penetrated the ship's mainframe. It seized control of the life support systems, causing oxygen levels to oscillate dramatically. Panic ensued among the crew as we battled to regain control.\n\nDay 12:\n\nCrew members started to vanish. One moment they were present, the next, they were gone without a trace. The entity appeared to be absorbing their energy, growing more powerful with each disappearance.\n\nDay 13:\n\nNow, I am the only one left. Alone, adrift in this metallic capsule, millions of miles from home. The entity surrounds me, pulsating with a creepy, alien energy. My time is dwindling.\n\nDay 14:\n\nI am uncertain if anyone will ever discover this log. If you do, please tell my family I love them. Tell them not to grieve for me. I was aware of the risks when I enlisted for this mission. Space exploration is about extending boundaries, uncovering the unknown. Sometimes, the unknown retaliates.\n\nThis is Captain Jameson, signing off."

It was unlike anything we had encountered before. Curiosity piqued, we decided to investigate this enigma.\n\n**Day 9:**\n\nWe found it \u2013 an entity composed entirely of pure energy. It defied all our expectations and understanding. We attempted to communicate with it but received no response.\n\n**Day 10:**\n\nSomething went terribly wrong. The entity attached itself to the Elysium, and our systems began to fail one by one. First, our communication system shut down, cutting us off from Earth. Then, our navigation system failed, leaving us drifting aimlessly through space.\n\n**Day 11:**\n\nThe entity infiltrated the ship's mainframe and took control of the life support systems, causing oxygen levels to fluctuate erratically. Panic set in among the crew as we fought to regain control.\n\n**Day 12:**\n\nCrew members started disappearing without a trace. One moment they were there, the next, gone. The entity seemed to be absorbing their energy, growing stronger with each disappearance.\n\n**Day 13:**\n\nNow, I am the only one left aboard. Alone in this metallic coffin, millions of miles from home. The entity surrounds me, pulsating with an eerie, alien energy. My time is running out.\n\n**Day 14:**\n\nI don't know if anyone will ever find this log. If you do, please tell my family that I love them. Assure them not to mourn for me. I was well aware of the risks when I volunteered for this mission. Space exploration is about pushing boundaries and discovering the unknown. Sometimes, the unknown fights back.\n\nThis is Captain Jameson, signing off."
