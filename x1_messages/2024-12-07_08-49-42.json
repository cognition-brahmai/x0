        "content": "So, the Earth's equator is about 24,901 miles long, and the airplane is traveling at an average speed of 550 miles per hour. To find out how long it would take to fly around the Earth's equator, we need to calculate the total time required for the journey.\n\nFirst, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 24,901 miles, and the speed is 550 miles per hour. Plugging in these values:\n\nTime = 24,901 miles / 550 miles per hour\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n24,901 \u00f7 550 \u2248 45.274545... hours\n\nSo, it would take approximately 45.27 hours to fly around the Earth's equator at an average speed of 550 miles per hour.\n\nBut, maybe we can think about this in a different way to verify the result. Let's consider that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can also express the time in hours and minutes.\n\nFirst, take the decimal part of the hours and convert it into minutes.\n\nWe have 0.274545 hours. To convert this to minutes, multiply by 60:\n\n0.274545 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour \u2248 16.4727 minutes\n\nSo, the total time is approximately 45 hours and 16 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express the time in days and hours, knowing that there are 24 hours in a day:\n\n45 hours \u00f7 24 hours/day = 1.875 days\n\nSo, it's about 1 day and 0.875 days. To find the remaining hours:\n\n0.875 days \u00d7 24 hours/day = 21 hours\n\nTherefore, 45 hours is equivalent to 1 day and 21 hours.\n\nBut, considering that 45 hours is less than 2 days, it's probably more straightforward to stick with hours and minutes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this calculation assumes a constant average speed and a direct path around the equator without any stops or changes in speed. In reality, factors such as wind, flight path, and rest stops for the crew would affect the total time.\n\nMoreover, the Earth's equator is approximately 24,901 miles long, but the actual length can vary slightly depending on how it's measured. However, for this calculation, using 24,901 miles is a reasonable approximation.\n\nIn summary, flying around the Earth's equator at 550 miles per hour would take approximately 45 hours and 16 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45.27 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
