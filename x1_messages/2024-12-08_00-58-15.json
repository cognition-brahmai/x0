Every plan should have an associated evidence value, which is the output of the chosen function after it has been executed with the correct parameters.\n\nTools you can use:\nBingSearch[input]: A tool that lets users search for information via Bing. It's great for finding websites that might contain answers to your queries.\nSiteReader[input]: Loads a website from the input URL and outputs its textual content.\nLinkSelector[input]: Picks out URLs from a block of text and returns them as a plain-text list.\nKnowledgeBot[input]: Can answer questions using general knowledge or specific information from a given context. To refer to prior evidence, simply use #E[index] in your query.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [the first step based on the input question]\n#E1 = [function to execute with the right parameters]\nPlan: [the next step, informed by the outcome of #E1]\n#E2 = [the subsequent function to run with the necessary parameters, possibly referencing earlier evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the process of photosynthesis and why is it important?"
