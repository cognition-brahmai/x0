        "content": "Let's see. The train travels between two cities that are 150 miles apart, and it takes 3 hours to complete the journey. I need to find out its average speed.\n\nI remember that average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. So, in this case, it would be the distance between the cities divided by the time it takes to travel that distance.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time.\n\nPlugging in the values, average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours.\n\nLet me do the math: 150 divided by 3 is 50.\n\nSo, the average speed of the train is 50 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward. Maybe there's something else I should consider.\n\nIs there any information about the train stopping at intermediate stations or anything like that? The question doesn't mention anything about stops, so I'll assume it's a direct journey without any halts.\n\nAlso, it says the train travels every day, but I don't think that affects the calculation of average speed for a single journey.\n\nSo, yes, average speed is indeed total distance divided by total time.\n\nTherefore, the train's average speed is 50 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
