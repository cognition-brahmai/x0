        "content": "Alright, I have this task to create a Python script that generates a random maze using Prim's algorithm and displays it using ASCII characters. The maze dimensions should be provided as command-line arguments, and the maze must have a single valid path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Prim's algorithm is and how it can be used to generate a maze. I know that Prim's algorithm is typically used to find a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph, but it can also be adapted to generate mazes, which are essentially spanning trees of a grid graph.\n\nSo, in the context of maze generation, each cell in the grid can be considered a node in the graph, and the walls between cells are the edges. The goal is to remove some of these walls to create a path that connects the start to the end, ensuring there's only one path between them, which makes it a tree (no cycles).\n\nI need to accept the number of rows and columns as command-line arguments. I should also handle cases where the user doesn't provide the arguments or provides invalid ones.\n\nLet me start by sketching out the plan:\n\n1. Parse command-line arguments for rows and columns.\n2. Initialize the grid with walls.\n3. Use Prim's algorithm to create a maze:\n   - Start from a cell (maybe the top-left corner).\n   - Keep track of visited cells and walls.\n   - Randomly select a wall that separates a visited cell from an unvisited one, remove that wall, and mark the new cell as visited.\n   - Repeat until all cells are visited.\n4. Ensure there's a path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.\n5. Display the maze using ASCII characters.\n\nI need to represent the grid in a way that allows me to easily manipulate walls and cell connections. One common way is to use a 2D list where each cell contains information about its walls or its connections to neighboring cells.\n\nI should also consider how to visualize the maze using ASCII characters. For example, using `#` for walls and ` ` (space) for paths.\n\nLet me think about the data structure. Each cell can have four walls: north, south, east, west. I can represent each cell as a dictionary with keys for each wall, indicating whether the wall is present or not.\n\nAlternatively, I can use integers to represent the walls, using bits to denote the presence of each wall.\n\nBut maybe a more efficient way is to represent the grid as a list of cells, where each cell knows its position and which walls are intact.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for existing implementations or resources on maze generation using Prim's algorithm to get a better idea.\n\nI found a few resources online that explain maze generation using Prim's algorithm. One of them suggests using a set to keep track of the frontiers (walls between visited and unvisited cells) and randomly selecting a wall to remove.\n\nI need to make sure that the maze generation process starts from the top-left corner and ensures connectivity to the bottom-right corner.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the command-line arguments properly. I can use the `sys.argv` list to get the arguments, and provide defaults or show an error if they are missing or invalid.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Import necessary modules:\n   - `sys` for command-line arguments\n   - `random` for selecting random walls\n\n2. Parse command-line arguments:\n   - Expect two integers: rows and columns\n   - Validate that they are positive integers, perhaps with a minimum size\n\n3. Initialize the grid:\n   - Create a 2D list representing the grid\n   - Each cell has walls in all four directions\n\n4. Implement Prim's algorithm:\n   - Choose a starting cell (top-left corner)\n   - Add all walls of the starting cell to a frontier list\n   - While the frontier is not empty:\n     - Randomly select a wall from the frontier\n     - If the wall leads to an unvisited cell:\n       - Remove the wall\n       - Mark the new cell as visited\n       - Add the new cell's walls to the frontier\n\n5. Ensure connectivity:\n   - Since Prim's algorithm generates a perfect maze with exactly one path between any two cells, this should be inherently satisfied.\n\n6. Display the maze:\n   - Iterate through the grid and print ASCII characters accordingly\n   - Use `#` for walls and ` ` for paths\n   - Handle the borders properly\n\nI should also think about how to represent the walls. One way is to have each cell store which of its four walls are present.\n\nFor example, a cell can have a dictionary like `{ 'N': True, 'S': True, 'E': True, 'W': True }`, where each key represents a wall (North, South, East, West), and the value indicates whether the wall is present.\n\nWhen removing a wall between two cells, I need to update both cells to remove that wall.\n\nI need to make sure that when I display the maze, I correctly represent the walls by checking each cell's wall status.\n\nLet me consider an example with a small grid, say 3x3, to visualize this.\n\nSuppose I have a 3x3 grid:\n\n```\n\n(0,0) - (0,1) - (0,2)\n\n| | |\n\n(1,0) - (1,1) - (1,2)\n\n| | |\n\n(2,0) - (2,1) - (2,2)\n\n```\n\nEach cell has four walls. For instance, cell (0,0) has walls to the South and East.\n\nAs I apply Prim's algorithm, I'll start from (0,0), remove some walls, and ensure I visit all cells.\n\nI need to make sure that the maze generation doesn't create cycles, which Prim's algorithm should handle naturally since it generates a spanning tree.\n\nNow, about the command-line arguments. I need to accept two integers for rows and columns.\n\nI should provide some error handling:\n\n- If fewer than two arguments are provided, show an error message and exit.\n\n- If the provided arguments are not integers or are too small (e.g., less than 2), show an error message and exit.\n\nI can use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors in converting the arguments to integers.\n\nAlso, I should consider that very large mazes might not display well or might take too long to generate, but for now, I'll assume reasonable dimensions.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the frontier. I can use a list to store the walls that are candidates for removal.\n\nEach wall can be represented by the cells it separates, or perhaps by its position in the grid.\n\nTo make it efficient, I need a way to quickly select a random wall from the frontier.\n\nPython's `random.choice()` function can select a random element from a list, which is perfect for this.\n\nWhen removing a wall, I need to:\n\n- Remove the wall from both adjacent cells.\n\n- Mark the new cell as visited.\n\n- Add the new cell's walls to the frontier, but only if they lead to unvisited cells.\n\nWait, actually, in Prim's algorithm, the frontier consists of walls between visited and unvisited cells.\n\nSo, when I remove a wall, I need to:\n\n- Remove the wall from both cells.\n\n- Move the new cell from unvisited to visited.\n\n- Add the new cell's walls to the frontier, but only if they lead to unvisited cells.\n\nI need to keep track of which cells have been visited.\n\nI can use a set to store visited cells, for quick lookups.\n\nSimilarly, I can use a list to store the frontier walls.\n\nI need to define how walls are represented. Perhaps each wall can be tuples containing the positions of the two cells it separates.\n\nFor example, the wall between (0,0) and (0,1) can be represented as ((0,0), (0,1)).\n\nBut this might be inefficient for large grids, as tuples can be slower to handle.\n\nAlternatively, I can number the cells and represent walls by their indices.\n\nBut perhaps using coordinates as tuples is clearer and manageable for smaller grids.\n\nI need to balance between clarity and performance, but for now, I'll go with tuples for cell positions.\n\nLet me try to outline the code structure:\n\n- Import necessary modules.\n\n- Define constants for wall directions if needed.\n\n- Define a function to parse command-line arguments and get rows and columns.\n\n- Define a function to initialize the grid with all walls intact.\n\n- Define a function to implement Prim's algorithm:\n\n- Start from the top-left cell, mark it as visited.\n\n- Add all its walls to the frontier.\n\n- While the frontier is not empty:\n\n- Randomly select a wall from the frontier.\n\n- If the adjacent cell is unvisited:\n\n- Remove the wall from both cells.\n\n- Mark the adjacent cell as visited.\n\n- Add the adjacent cell's walls to the frontier, checking if they lead to unvisited cells.\n\n- Remove the wall from the frontier.\n\n- Define a function to display the maze:\n\n- Iterate through each row and column.\n\n- For each cell, print walls accordingly.\n\n- Use `#` for walls and ` ` for paths.\n\n- Handle the borders correctly.\n\nFinally, in the main part of the script, call these functions in sequence:\n\n- Parse arguments.\n\n- Initialize grid.\n\n- Generate maze using Prim's algorithm.\n\n- Display the maze.\n\nI should also add comments to the code for clarity and include a docstring at the beginning of the script explaining its purpose.\n\nLet me consider edge cases:\n\n- Minimum maze size: 2x2.\n\n- Ensure that the maze is fully connected, i.e., there are no isolated sections.\n\n- Ensure that the start and end points are accessible.\n\n- Handle cases where rows or columns are 1 (though mazes with dimensions less than 2 might not make sense).\n\nI need to decide how to handle borders. Should the entire maze be enclosed by walls, or should some borders be open?\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that the maze is enclosed by walls, with the entrance at the top-left and exit at the bottom-right.\n\nI need to make sure that the top-left and bottom-right cells are not blocked by outer walls, but since the maze is enclosed, these cells will have their respective outer walls removed.\n\nWait, actually, in a fully enclosed maze, the entrance and exit would need to have their outer walls removed to allow entry and exit.\n\nSo, I need to remove the north wall of the top-left cell and the south wall of the bottom-right cell.\n\nI should add that to the maze generation process.\n\nLet me think about the grid representation again.\n\nEach cell has four walls: north, south, east, west.\n\nI can represent the grid as a list of lists, where each cell is a dictionary with wall statuses.\n\nBut maybe using a class for cells would be better.\n\nI can define a Cell class with walls as attributes.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll use a dictionary for each cell.\n\nSo, grid[row][col] = { 'N': True, 'S': True, 'E': True, 'W': True }\n\nWhen removing a wall between two cells, say cell A and cell B, I set grid[A_row][A_col]['direction'] = False and grid[B_row][B_col]['opposite_direction'] = False, where direction is the direction from A to B, and opposite_direction is from B to A.\n\nFor example, if A is (0,0) and B is (0,1), removing the east wall of A and the west wall of B.\n\nI need to map directions to wall removal.\n\nI should define helper functions to get neighboring cells and to get the wall directions.\n\nI need to ensure that when I select a wall from the frontier, I correctly identify the adjacent cells and remove the appropriate walls.\n\nThis might get a bit tricky with edge cases, like cells on the borders that have some walls as outer walls.\n\nBut since the maze is enclosed, I can treat outer walls as always present, except for the entrance and exit.\n\nWait, no. I need to remove the north wall of the top-row cells and the south wall of the bottom-row cells, but only for the entrance and exit.\n\nActually, no. Since the maze is enclosed, I'll keep all outer walls intact, and just ensure that there's a path from the top-left to the bottom-right within the maze.\n\nI can think of the top-left and bottom-right cells as the starting and ending points, respectively, and ensure that they are connected through the maze.\n\nI need to make sure that the maze generation algorithm connects all parts of the maze, which it should, as Prim's algorithm generates a spanning tree.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation in code.\n\nFirst, parse command-line arguments.\n\nI can use `sys.argv` to get the arguments.\n\nCheck if exactly two arguments are provided, convert them to integers, and ensure they are at least 2.\n\nIf not, print an error message and exit.\n\nNext, initialize the grid.\n\nCreate a list of lists, where each cell is a dictionary with wall statuses.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a list of lists with integers representing wall bits.\n\nBut for clarity, I'll use dictionaries.\n\nDefine directions and their opposites:\n\ndirections = { 'N': 'S', 'S': 'N', 'E': 'W', 'W': 'E' }\n\nThis will help in removing walls between cells.\n\nDefine a function to initialize the grid:\n\ndef initialize_grid(rows, cols):\n\ngrid = []\n\nfor _ in range(rows):\n\ngrid.append([{ 'N': True, 'S': True, 'E': True, 'W': True } for _ in range(cols)])\n\nreturn grid\n\nThen, implement Prim's algorithm.\n\nDefine a function to get the neighbors of a cell, considering grid boundaries.\n\ndef get_neighbors(row, col, rows, cols):\n\nneighbors = []\n\nif row > 0:\n\nneighbors.append(((row-1, col), 'N'))\n\nif row < rows-1:\n\nneighbors.append(((row+1, col), 'S'))\n\nif col > 0:\n\nneighbors.append(((row, col-1), 'W'))\n\nif col < cols-1:\n\nneighbors.append(((row, col+1), 'E'))\n\nreturn neighbors\n\nThis function returns a list of neighboring cells and the direction to them.\n\nThen, in the maze generation function, start from (0,0), mark it as visited, and add its walls to the frontier.\n\nUse a set to keep track of visited cells.\n\nfrontier = []\n\nstart = (0, 0)\n\nvisited = set()\n\nvisited.add(start)\n\nfor neighbor, direction in get_neighbors(0, 0, rows, cols):\n\nfrontier.append(((start, neighbor), direction))\n\nThen, while the frontier is not empty:\n\nwall = random.choice(frontier)\n\ncell_a, cell_b = wall[0]\n\ndirection = wall[1]\n\nif cell_b not in visited:\n\n# Remove the wall between cell_a and cell_b\n\ngrid[cell_a[0]][cell_a[1]][direction] = False\n\ngrid[cell_b[0]][cell_b[1]][directions[direction]] = False\n\n# Mark cell_b as visited\n\nvisited.add(cell_b)\n\n# Add cell_b's walls to the frontier\n\nfor neighbor, dir in get_neighbors(cell_b[0], cell_b[1], rows, cols):\n\nif neighbor not in visited:\n\nfrontier.append(((cell_b, neighbor), dir))\n\n# Remove the wall from the frontier\n\nfrontier.remove(wall)\n\nWait, but this might not be the most efficient way, as removing from a list is O(n).\n\nPerhaps I should use a list for the frontier and avoid removing elements from it, to keep it simple.\n\nInstead, I can keep a set of visited cells and check if a cell has been visited before adding its walls to the frontier.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't add walls that lead to already visited cells.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep the frontier as a list and avoid removing elements, but mark walls as used or something similar.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll proceed with the list and remove the wall after processing.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the removal is efficient.\n\nMaybe I can use a while loop with a random index.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use a set for the frontier, but sets don't allow duplicates, and walls are unique.\n\nWait, actually, walls are unique, so a set should work.\n\nBut removing from a set is efficient.\n\nSo, I can use a set for the frontier.\n\nLet me adjust the plan:\n\n- Use a set for the frontier.\n\n- Use a set for visited cells.\n\n- Start from (0,0), mark it as visited.\n\n- Add all its walls to the frontier.\n\n- While the frontier is not empty:\n\n- Choose a random wall from the frontier.\n\n- If the adjacent cell is unvisited:\n\n- Remove the wall between the cells.\n\n- Mark the adjacent cell as visited.\n\n- Add the adjacent cell's walls to the frontier.\n\n- Remove the wall from the frontier.\n\nThis should work efficiently.\n\nNow, for displaying the maze.\n\nI need to iterate through each row and column and print the walls accordingly.\n\nI can start by printing the north walls of the top row.\n\nThen, for each row, print the west walls, the cell paths, and the east walls.\n\nFinally, print the south walls of the bottom row.\n\nThis might be a bit tricky to get right, but with careful iteration, it should work.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nFor example, for a 3x3 grid:\n\n- Print the top borders: for each cell in row 0, print `#` if north wall is True.\n\n- Then, for each row:\n\n- Print the left borders: for each cell in the row, print `#` if west wall is True.\n\n- Print the cell paths: for each cell in the row, print ` ` if the cell is part of the path, else `#`.\n\n- Print the right borders: for each cell in the row, print `#` if east wall is True.\n\n- Finally, print the bottom borders: for each cell in the last row, print `#` if south wall is True.\n\nWait, I need to adjust this.\n\nActually, in ASCII representation:\n\n- Horizontal walls are represented by `--` or space.\n\n- Vertical walls are represented by `|` or space.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to iterate through the grid and for each cell, print its walls appropriately.\n\nI found that it's easier to think in terms of printing the entire grid cell by cell, including their walls.\n\nI can find some existing code or pseudocode for this.\n\nI recall that one way to print the maze is to iterate through each row of walls and then through each cell's walls.\n\nLet me try to sketch a small example.\n\nConsider a 2x2 grid:\n\nCells: (0,0), (0,1)\n\n(1,0), (1,1)\n\nAssuming some walls are removed, for example, the east wall of (0,0) and the south wall of (0,0).\n\nThe ASCII representation would be:\n\n```\n\n+---+---+\n\n| # # # |\n\n+ # +---+\n\n| # # # |\n\n+---+---+\n\n```\n\nWait, that's not correct.\n\nActually, it's better to think in terms of printing the grid cell by cell, including their walls.\n\nEach cell can be represented by their four walls, and by combining them appropriately, we can form the entire maze.\n\nI found a pattern where for each cell, we print its south and east walls, and adjust for overlaps.\n\nThis requires careful iteration to ensure that walls are only printed once.\n\nThis can be a bit complex, but I'll try to implement it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can find a library that can handle maze visualization, but since the task is to use ASCII characters, I need to implement it manually.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll proceed with manual ASCII generation.\n\nLet me think about the steps for displaying the maze:\n\n1. Print the top border:\n\n- A series of `+---+` for each column.\n\n2. For each row:\n\na. Print the north walls of the cells in that row.\n\n- For each cell, print `|` followed by spaces or walls.\n\nb. Print the south walls of the cells in that row.\n\n- For each cell, print `+` followed by `-` or space, depending on the south wall.\n\n3. After the last row, print the bottom border.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet me try to write pseudocode for this.\n\nDefine a function to display the maze:\n\ndef display_maze(grid, rows, cols):\n\n# Print the top border\n\nprint(\" \" + \"----\" * cols)\n\nfor row in range(rows):\n\n# Print the north walls\n\nprint(\"|\" + \"\".join(\" \" if grid[row][col]['N'] else \" \" for col in range(cols)) + \"|\")\n\n# Print the cell paths and south walls\n\nprint(\"+\" + \"\".join(\"----\" if grid[row][col]['S'] else \"    \" for col in range(cols)) + \"+\")\n\nThis is a rough sketch and might need adjustments.\n\nI need to make sure that the walls align correctly.\n\nLet me test this with a small grid.\n\nConsider a 2x2 grid where all walls are present.\n\nThe display should be:\n\n```\n\n+---+---+\n\n| | |\n\n+---+---+\n\n| | |\n\n+---+---+\n\n```\n\nNow, if I remove the east wall between (0,0) and (0,1), and the south wall between (0,0) and (1,0), it should look like:\n\n```\n\n+---+---+\n\n| | |\n\n+ | +---+\n\n| | |\n\n+---+---+\n\n```\n\nWait, no. If the east wall between (0,0) and (0,1) is removed, the north walls should be open between them.\n\nActually, I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that each cell has its four walls, and when printing, I need to ensure that if two cells share a wall, only one of them needs to print the wall.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I can have each cell print its south and east walls, and the next cell can print its north and west walls, but only if those walls are present.\n\nWait, that might still be confusing.\n\nI found a better approach online: representing the maze by iterating through each row of walls and then each cell's walls.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\n- Print the top border.\n\n- For each row:\n\n- Print the north walls of the cells in that row.\n\n- Print the cell paths and the south walls.\n\n- Print the bottom border after the last row.\n\nIn code, it would look like this:\n\ndef display_maze(grid, rows, cols):\n\n# Top border\n\nprint(\" \" + \"---- \" * cols)\n\nfor row in range(rows):\n\n# North walls\n\nprint(\"|\" + \"\".join(\" \" if grid[row][col]['N'] else \" \" for col in range(cols)) + \"|\")\n\n# Cell paths and south walls\n\nfor col in range(cols):\n\nprint(\"+\", end=\"\")\n\nif grid[row][col]['S']:\n\nprint(\"---+\", end=\"\")\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\" \", end=\"\")\n\nprint()\n\n# Bottom border\n\nprint(\" \" + \"---- \" * cols)\n\nWait, this still seems off.\n\nLet me try with a 2x2 grid where all walls are present.\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\n\n+---+---+\n\n| | |\n\n+---+---+\n\n| | |\n\n+---+---+\n\n```\n\nUsing the above function:\n\n- Top border: ` ---- ---- `\n\n- Row 0 north walls: `| | |`\n\n- Row 0 cell paths and south walls: `+---+---+`\n\n- Row 1 north walls: `| | |`\n\n- Row 1 cell paths and south walls: `+---+---+`\n\n- Bottom border: ` ---- ---- `\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, if I remove the east wall between (0,0) and (0,1), meaning grid[0][0]['E'] = False and grid[0][1]['W'] = False, then in the north walls row, the space between them should be open.\n\nWait, no. The north walls are the top of the cells.\n\nActually, I need to adjust the function to correctly represent the removal of walls.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can represent each cell as:\n\n```\n\n+---+\n\n| |\n\n+---+\n\n```\n\nWhere the `+` are corners, and the `-` and `|` are the walls.\n\nTo remove a wall between two cells, I need to not print the wall between them.\n\nSo, for example, removing the east wall between (0,0) and (0,1) means not printing the vertical wall between them.\n\nThis requires careful iteration over the grid to print the walls correctly.\n\nI found a better approach: iterate over the grid row by row, printing the north walls and then the west walls for each cell.\n\nHere's a refined plan:\n\n- For each row:\n\n- Print the north walls of the cells in that row.\n\n- Print the west walls and the cell paths for each cell in that row.\n\n- After the last row, print the south walls.\n\nIn code:\n\ndef display_maze(grid, rows, cols):\n\nfor row in range(rows):\n\n# North walls\n\nprint(\" \" + \"\".join(\"--- \" if grid[row][col]['N'] else \" \" for col in range(cols)))\n\n# West walls and cell paths\n\nfor col in range(cols):\n\nprint(\"|\" if grid[row][col]['W'] else \" \", end=\"\")\n\nprint(\" \", end=\"\")\n\nprint()\n\n# South walls\n\nprint(\" \" + \"\".join(\"--- \" if grid[row][col]['S'] else \" \" for col in range(cols)))\n\nThis might still not be perfect, but it's a start.\n\nLet me test this with a 2x2 grid where all walls are present.\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\n\n --- --- \n\n| | | \n\n --- --- \n\n| | | \n\n --- --- \n\n```\n\nThis is close, but the pluses (+) at the corners are missing.\n\nTo include the corners, I need to print them where walls meet.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nI need a more systematic way to print the maze.\n\nI found a better approach: iterate over the grid and print each cell's walls, making sure that shared walls are only printed once.\n\nHere's an improved plan:\n\n- For each row:\n\n- Print the north walls of the cells in that row.\n\n- Print the west walls and the cell paths for each cell in that row.\n\n- After printing all rows, print the south walls.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the corners are correctly represented with `+`.\n\nLet me try to write a more detailed function.\n\ndef display_maze(grid, rows, cols):\n\n# Top border\n\nprint(\" \" + \"----\" * cols)\n\nfor row in range(rows):\n\n# North walls\n\nprint(\"|\" + \"\".join(\" \" if grid[row][col]['N'] else \" \" for col in range(cols)) + \"|\")\n\n# Cell paths and south walls\n\nfor col in range(cols):\n\nprint(\"+\", end=\"\")\n\nif grid[row][col]['S']:\n\nprint(\"---+\", end=\"\")\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\" \", end=\"\")\n\nprint()\n\n# Bottom border\n\nprint(\" \" + \"----\" * cols)\n\nThis should work better.\n\nLet's test it with a 2x2 grid where all walls are present.\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n\n ---- ---- \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n```\n\nAlmost there, but the top border should start with a `+`, not a space.\n\nI need to adjust the top border to start with a `+`.\n\ndef display_maze(grid, rows, cols):\n\n# Top border\n\nprint(\"+\" + \"----+\" * cols)\n\nfor row in range(rows):\n\n# North walls\n\nprint(\"|\" + \"\".join(\" \" if grid[row][col]['N'] else \" \" for col in range(cols)) + \"|\")\n\n# Cell paths and south walls\n\nfor col in range(cols):\n\nprint(\"+\", end=\"\")\n\nif grid[row][col]['S']:\n\nprint(\"---+\", end=\"\")\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\" \", end=\"\")\n\nprint()\n\n# Bottom border\n\nprint(\"+\" + \"----+\" * cols)\n\nNow, with all walls present, it should look like:\n\n```\n\n+----+----+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n```\n\nWait, still not perfect. The top border is `+----+----+`, but the north walls are printed with `| | |`, which doesn't align correctly.\n\nI need to ensure that the north walls align with the top border.\n\nPerhaps I need to print the north walls as `+---+---+` if the north walls are present, or `+ : + : +` if some are removed.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a standard way to print mazes with ASCII characters.\n\nI found that a common approach is to iterate over the grid and print each cell's walls, ensuring that shared walls are only printed once.\n\nHere's a more systematic way:\n\n- Print the top border: `+---+---+---+ ...`\n\n- For each row:\n\n- Print the north walls of the cells.\n\n- Print the west walls and the cell paths.\n\n- Print the south walls of the cells.\n\n- Print the bottom border.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the corners are correctly represented.\n\nLet me try to find a code snippet or example that does this.\n\nI found an example where each cell is represented by its south and east walls.\n\nBy iterating through the grid and printing each cell's south and east walls, and ensuring that shared walls are only printed once, I can create the maze.\n\nHere's a refined approach:\n\ndef display_maze(grid, rows, cols):\n\n# Top border\n\nprint(\" \" + \"---- \" * cols)\n\nfor row in range(rows):\n\n# North walls (always present in this representation)\n\nprint(\"|\" + \"\".join(\" \" if grid[row][col]['N'] else \" \" for col in range(cols)) + \"|\")\n\n# Cell paths and south walls\n\nfor col in range(cols):\n\nprint(\"+\", end=\"\")\n\nif grid[row][col]['S']:\n\nprint(\"---+\", end=\"\")\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\" \", end=\"\")\n\nprint()\n\n# Bottom border\n\nprint(\" \" + \"---- \" * cols)\n\nThis should work correctly.\n\nLet's test it with a 2x2 grid where all walls are present.\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n\n ---- ---- \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n```\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nNow, if I remove the east wall between (0,0) and (0,1), meaning grid[0][0]['E'] = False and grid[0][1]['W'] = False, the output should be:\n\n```\n\n ---- ---- \n\n| | | \n\n+ : +---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n```\n\nWait, no. Removing the east wall of (0,0) and west wall of (0,1) should remove the vertical wall between them.\n\nSo, in the north walls row, there should be a space instead of `|` between them.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to represent the east walls separately.\n\nI think I need to adjust the function to print the east walls correctly.\n\nLet me try to improve the function.\n\ndef display_maze(grid, rows, cols):\n\n# Top border\n\nprint(\" \" + \"---- \" * cols)\n\nfor row in range(rows):\n\n# North walls (always present in this representation)\n\nprint(\"|\" + \"\".join(\" \" if grid[row][col]['N'] else \" \" for col in range(cols)) + \"|\")\n\n# Cell paths and south walls\n\nfor col in range(cols):\n\nprint(\"+\", end=\"\")\n\nif grid[row][col]['E']:\n\nprint(\"---+\", end=\"\")\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\" \", end=\"\")\n\nprint()\n\n# Bottom border\n\nprint(\"+\" + \"----+\" * cols)\n\nWait, no.

at the corners.\n\nI need to ensure that the corners are printed correctly.\n\nPerhaps I should iterate over the grid and print each cell's walls, making sure that the corners are represented by `+`.\n\nI found a better approach: iterate over the grid row by row, printing the north walls and then the west walls for each cell, and ensuring that the corners are `+`.\n\nHere's a more detailed plan:\n\n- Print the top border: `+---+---+---+ ...`\n\n- For each row:\n\n- Print the north walls of the cells.\n\n- Print the west walls and the cell paths.\n\n- Print the south walls of the cells.\n\n- Print the bottom border.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for an existing implementation or a library that can handle this.\n\nI found that the `maze` library in Python can generate mazes and display them, but since the task is to create a script from scratch, I need to implement it manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the maze in a different way, where each cell is represented by its walls, and then print the entire grid accordingly.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nEach cell can be represented by its four walls, and I can create a larger grid of ASCII characters, where each cell is a block of characters including its walls.\n\nFor example, a single cell can be represented as:\n\n```\n\n+---+\n\n| |\n\n+---+\n\n```\n\nBy combining these blocks appropriately, I can form the entire maze.\n\nBut this would require careful handling of shared walls.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a character grid where each cell's walls are mapped to specific positions in the grid.\n\nI found that it's common to use a character grid where:\n\n- `+` represents a corner where walls meet.\n\n- `-` represents a horizontal wall.\n\n- `|` represents a vertical wall.\n\n- Space represents a path.\n\nBy iterating through the grid and setting these characters appropriately based on the presence of walls, I can construct the maze.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach.\n\nLet me try to implement it.\n\nFirst, create a character grid where each cell is represented by a block of characters.\n\nFor a grid with `rows` rows and `cols` columns, the character grid will have:\n\n- Horizontal lines: `rows * 2 + 1` (top border, middle lines, bottom border)\n\n- Vertical lines: `cols * 2 + 1` (left border, middle lines, right border)\n\nSo, the character grid will be of size `(rows * 2 + 1) x (cols * 2 + 1)`.\n\nEach cell in the original grid corresponds to a block in the character grid:\n\n- The top-left corner of the block is at `(2*row, 2*col)` in the character grid.\n\n- The walls are set as follows:\n\n- North wall: character grid `[2*row][2*col+1]` to `[2*row][2*col+2]`\n\n- South wall: character grid `[2*row+2][2*col+1]` to `[2*row+2][2*col+2]`\n\n- West wall: character grid `[2*row+1][2*col]`\n\n- East wall: character grid `[2*row+1][2*col+2]`\n\n- The center of the block (path) is at `[2*row+1][2*col+1]`\n\nBy setting the appropriate characters in the character grid based on the presence of walls in the original grid, I can construct the maze.\n\nFinally, I can print the character grid to display the maze.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet me try to write a function for this.\n\ndef display_maze(grid, rows, cols):\n\n# Create a character grid filled with spaces\n\nchar_grid = []\n\nfor _ in range(2*rows + 1):\n\nrow = [' ' for _ in range(2*cols + 1)]\n\nchar_grid.append(row)\n\n# Set the borders\n\nfor row in range(2*rows + 1):\n\nfor col in range(2*cols + 1):\n\nif row % 2 == 0:\n\n# Horizontal lines\n\nif col % 2 ==

'|'\n\nelse:\n\nchar_grid[row][col] = ' '\n\n# Set the internal walls based on the grid\n\nfor row in range(rows):\n\nfor col in range(cols):\n\ncell = grid[row][col]\n\n# North wall\n\nif cell['N']:\n\nchar_grid[2*row][2*col+1] = '-'\n\n# South wall\n\nif cell['S']:\n\nchar_grid[2*row+2][2*col+1] = '-'\n\n# West wall\n\nif cell['W']:\n\nchar_grid[2*row+1][2*col] = '|'\n\n# East wall\n\nif cell['E']:\n\nchar_grid[2*row+1][2*col+2] = '|'\n\n# Print the character grid\n\nfor row in char_grid:\n\nprint(''.join(row))\n\nThis should work correctly.\n\nLet's test it with a 2x2 grid where all walls are present.\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\n\n+---+---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n```\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nNow, if I remove the east wall between (0,0) and (0,1), meaning grid[0][0]['E'] = False and grid[0][1]['W'] = False, the output should be:\n\n```\n\n+---+---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+ : +---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n```\n\nWait, no. Removing the east wall of (0,0) means that char_grid[1][3] should not have a '|'.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n```\n\n+---+---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+ : +---+ \n\n| | | \n\n+---+---+ \n\n```\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nGreat, this seems to work.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the top-left and bottom-right cells are accessible.\n\nSince Prim's algorithm generates a perfect maze with a single path between any two cells, the start and end should be connected.\n\nHowever, to ensure that there's a path from the top-left to the bottom-right, I can perform a flood fill or BFS from the start and check if the end is reachable.\n\nBut since Prim's algorithm guarantees connectivity, this should not be necessary.\n\nFinally, I need to handle command-line arguments.\n\nImport `sys` and `random`.\n\nDefine the necessary functions.\n\nPut it all together in the main part of the script.\n\nI should also add a docstring at the beginning of the script explaining its purpose.\n\nLet me

work as expected.\n\nI need to make sure that the maze generation starts from the top-left cell and ensures connectivity to the bottom-right cell, which Prim's algorithm should handle.\n\nI should also consider that the maze might look different each time due to the random selection of walls.\n\nFinally, I need to test the script with different grid sizes to ensure it works correctly.\n\nFor example, a 2x2 grid should produce a small maze with a single path from start to end.\n\nA larger grid, say 10x10, should generate a more complex maze.\n\nI should also handle cases where rows or columns are less than 2 by showing an error message.\n\nI think this covers the requirements of the task.\n\n**Final Solution**\nTo create a Python script that generates a random maze using Prim's algorithm and displays it using ASCII characters, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Prim's Algorithm for Maze Generation**:\n   - Start from a cell (top-left corner).\n   - Use a set to track visited cells and a list for the frontier of walls.\n   - Randomly select a wall from the frontier and remove it if it leads to an unvisited cell.\n   - Repeat until all cells are visited.\n\n2. **Grid Representation**:\n   - Each cell is represented as a dictionary of wall statuses (North, South, East, West).\n\n3. **Display the Maze**:\n   - Use ASCII characters to represent walls and paths.\n   - Ensure the maze is enclosed with borders.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport random\n\nDIRECTIONS = { 'N': 'S', 'S': 'N', 'E': 'W', 'W': 'E' }\n\ndef
