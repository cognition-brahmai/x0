        "content": "So, the question is: if a person consumes 2500 calories per day, how many calories does he consume in a month, specifically February in a leap year? And I need to provide step-by-step logic.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days are in February during a leap year. I remember that a leap year has 366 days instead of the usual 365, and that extra day is added to February, making it 29 days long. So, February in a leap year has 29 days.\n\nNext, if the person consumes 2500 calories each day, and February has 29 days, then the total calorie consumption for the month would be the daily consumption multiplied by the number of days in the month.\n\nSo, the calculation should be:\n\nTotal calories = daily calories \u00d7 number of days\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal calories = 2500 calories/day \u00d7 29 days\n\nNow, I need to do the multiplication. 2500 times 29.\n\nI can break this down to make it easier. I know that 2500 times 10 is 25,000, and 2500 times 20 is 50,000. Then, 2500 times 9 is 22,500.\n\nWait, actually, 29 is 20 plus 9, so:\n\n2500 \u00d7 20 = 50,000\n\n2500 \u00d7 9 = 22,500\n\nThen, total calories = 50,000 + 22,500 = 72,500 calories\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate 2500 \u00d7 30 = 75,000, and then subtract 2500 to account for the 29 days.\n\nBut wait, February in a leap year has 29 days, not 30. So, the first method is more accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total calorie consumption for February in a leap year is 72,500 calories.\n\nI should double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recalculate: 2500 \u00d7 29.\n\n2500 \u00d7 20 = 50,000\n\n2500 \u00d7 9 = 22,500\n\nAdding them up: 50,000 + 22,500 = 72,500\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 2500 as 25 hundred, so 25 \u00d7 29 = 725, and then add the two zeros back, making it 72,500.\n\nEither way, the answer is the same.\n\nSo, the person consumes 72,500 calories in February during a leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72500} \\]"
