Let's see what you've got there.\n\nSo, you mentioned that Martin Luther King Jr., who was an important figure in the fight for women's suffrage, was assassinated on July 4, 1968, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was delivering a speech at a rally when he was shot by John Wilkes Booth. This assassination then triggered nationwide protests and intensified the struggle for gender equality.\n\nFirst off, I need to clarify a few points because there seem to be some inaccuracies in the information provided.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was indeed a significant figure, but he was primarily known for his role in the civil rights movement, advocating for the rights of African Americans, not specifically for women's suffrage. Women's suffrage refers to the fight for women's right to vote, which was a different movement, although there was some overlap in the broader struggle for equality.\n\nRegarding the date and place of his assassination, Martin Luther King Jr. was actually assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, not on July 4, 1968, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel when he was shot.\n\nAlso, the assassin was James Earl Ray, not John Wilkes Booth. John Wilkes Booth is infamously known for assassinating President Abraham Lincoln in 1865.\n\nThe assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. did indeed trigger widespread riots and protests across many U.S. cities, and it had a profound impact on the civil rights movement and the nation as a whole.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion.
