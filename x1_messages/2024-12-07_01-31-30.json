        "content": "Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. It involves the use of computer algorithms to analyze, understand, and generate human language. This field has many applications, including machine translation, speech recognition, and information extraction. One of the challenges in computational linguistics is the ambiguity of human language, which can be difficult for computers to understand. What is a major challenge in the field of computational linguistics?\nA. The inability of computers to process large amounts of data.\nB. The difficulty of creating algorithms that can understand human emotions.\nC. The ambiguity and complexity of human language.\nD. The lack of standardized languages for computer programming.\nE. A and C."

        "content": "A major challenge in the field of computational linguistics is the ambiguity and complexity of human language, which corresponds to option C. Human language is filled with nuances, idioms, sarcasm, and context-dependent meanings that are difficult for computers to interpret accurately. This ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings and errors in tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering.\n\nWhile option A mentions the inability of computers to process large amounts of data, modern computing technologies have significantly improved in handling big data, making this less of a challenge in recent years. Option B, regarding the difficulty of creating algorithms that can understand human emotions, is indeed a challenge in computational linguistics, particularly in the subfield of sentiment analysis. However, it is more specific compared to the general ambiguity of language.\n\nOption D, the lack of standardized languages for computer programming, is not directly related to computational linguistics, which focuses on natural human languages rather than programming languages. Option E combines A and C, but since A is less of a challenge due to advancements in technology, the primary challenge remains the ambiguity and complexity of human language.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C: The ambiguity and complexity of human language."
