        "content": "Let's see. So, there are three movies being watched in one day by a group of friends, and they're taking breaks in between. I need to figure out what time they'll finish watching all three movies if they start at 3 PM.\n\nFirst, I should list out the durations of each movie:\n\n- First movie: 2 hours and 15 minutes\n\n- Second movie: 1 hour and 45 minutes\n\n- Third movie: 2 hours and 30 minutes\n\nAnd they're taking a 15-minute break between each movie. Since there are three movies, there will be two breaks in total.\n\nSo, total time for breaks: 2 breaks \u00d7 15 minutes each = 30 minutes\n\nNow, I need to add up the durations of all three movies and the total break time to find out the total time spent.\n\nFirst, let's add the movie durations:\n\n- First movie: 2 hours 15 minutes\n\n- Second movie: 1 hour 45 minutes\n\n- Third movie: 2 hours 30 minutes\n\nAdding these up:\n\nHours: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours\n\nMinutes: 15 + 45 + 30 = 90 minutes\n\nBut 90 minutes is 1 hour and 30 minutes, so adding that to the hours:\n\n5 hours + 1 hour = 6 hours, and 30 minutes remaining.\n\nSo, total movie time: 6 hours 30 minutes\n\nNow, add the break time: 30 minutes\n\nTotal time spent: 6 hours 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 7 hours\n\nNow, they start at 3 PM. So, adding 7 hours to 3 PM:\n\n3 PM + 7 hours = 10 PM\n\nTherefore, they will finish watching all three movies at 10 PM.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the addition of the movie durations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst movie: 2 hours 15 minutes\n\nSecond movie: 1 hour 45 minutes\n\nAdding these two:\n\n2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\n15 minutes + 45 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour\n\nSo, total so far: 3 hours + 1 hour = 4 hours\n\nNow, add the third movie: 2 hours 30 minutes\n\n4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours\n\n30 minutes remain\n\nSo, total movie time: 6 hours 30 minutes\n\nBreak time: 2 breaks \u00d7 15 minutes each = 30 minutes\n\nTotal time: 6 hours 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 7 hours\n\nStarting at 3 PM:\n\n3 PM + 7 hours = 10 PM\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step:\n\n- Start time: 3 PM\n\n- First movie: 2 hours 15 minutes \u2192 ends at 5:15 PM\n\n- Break: 15 minutes \u2192 ends at 5:30 PM\n\n- Second movie: 1 hour 45 minutes \u2192 ends at 7:15 PM\n\n- Break: 15 minutes \u2192 ends at 7:30 PM\n\n- Third movie: 2 hours 30 minutes \u2192 ends at 10 PM\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation. So, they will finish at 10 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10\\ \\text{PM}} \\]"
