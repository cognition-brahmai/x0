        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help with that calculation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total area allocated for the tennis courts and other amenities. The entire sports complex is 50 acres. The stadium takes up 30% of the space, and the swimming pool occupies 20%. So, the remaining percentage for tennis courts and other amenities would be 100% - 30% - 20% = 50%.\n\nNow, to find out how many acres are allocated for tennis courts and other amenities, we calculate 50% of 50 acres.\n\n50% of 50 acres is (50/100) * 50 = 25 acres.\n\nNext, we need to know how much area each tennis court requires. According to the problem, each tennis court requires 0.5 acres of land.\n\nTo find out how many tennis courts can be built, we divide the total area allocated for tennis courts by the area required per court.\n\nSo, number of tennis courts = total area for tennis courts / area per court = 25 acres / 0.5 acres per court.\n\nNow, 25 divided by 0.5 is the same as 25 multiplied by 2, which equals 50.\n\nTherefore, the sports complex can accommodate 50 tennis courts.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions \"other amenities\" as well, which are included in the remaining 50% of the land. It doesn't specify how much of that 25 acres is allocated specifically to tennis courts versus other amenities. If some of the 25 acres are reserved for other amenities, then the number of tennis courts would be less.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide specific information about the allocation between tennis courts and other amenities within that 25 acres. It only mentions that the remaining area is allocated for tennis courts and other amenities, without specifying the exact proportions.\n\nGiven that, we can make a couple of assumptions:\n\n1. If all of the remaining 25 acres are allocated to tennis courts, then the number would be 50 courts, as calculated earlier.\n\n2. If only a\u90e8\u5206 of the 25 acres is allocated to tennis courts, then the number would be less.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the intention is to assume that the entire remaining area is used for tennis courts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard ratio for such allocations, but without specific information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider that \"other amenities\" might include facilities like parking lots, restrooms, changing rooms, etc., which are necessary but don't require as much space as the tennis courts.\n\nPerhaps we can estimate the area needed for other amenities and then allocate the remainder to tennis courts.\n\nBut again, without specific data, this would be speculative.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most straightforward approach is to assume that the entire 25 acres are available for tennis courts.\n\nTherefore, the number of tennis courts that can be built is 50.\n\nHowever, in reality, it's unlikely that all the remaining land would be used for tennis courts alone, as other facilities are necessary for a comprehensive sports complex.\n\nSo, to provide a more realistic estimate, perhaps we can allocate a portion of the 25 acres to other amenities and the rest to tennis courts.\n\nFor example, if we allocate 10 acres for other amenities, that would leave 15 acres for tennis courts.\n\nThen, the number of tennis courts would be 15 / 0.5 = 30 courts.\n\nAlternatively, if we allocate 15 acres for other amenities, that would leave 10 acres for tennis courts, resulting in 10 / 0.5 = 20 courts.\n\nWithout specific instructions, it's difficult to determine the exact number.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to assume that all the remaining land is used for tennis courts, in which case the answer would be 50 courts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is additional information or context that I'm missing here.\n\nLet me check the problem again.\n\n\"A city is planning to construct a new sports complex with multiple facilities, including a stadium, swimming pool, and tennis courts. The total area of the complex is 50 acres, with the stadium taking up 30% of the space, the swimming pool occupying 20%, and the remaining area allocated for tennis courts and other amenities. Calculate the number of tennis courts that can be built if each court requires 0.5 acres of land, and provide step-by-step reasoning.\"\n\nIt seems straightforward. The key points are:\n\n- Total area: 50 acres\n\n- Stadium: 30%\n\n- Swimming pool: 20%\n\n- Remaining: 50%, allocated for tennis courts and other amenities\n\n- Each tennis court requires 0.5 acres\n\nThe question is to calculate the number of tennis courts that can be built.\n\nGiven that, and without additional information on how the remaining 50% is subdivided between tennis courts and other amenities, the safest approach is to assume that the entire remaining area is allocated to tennis courts.\n\nTherefore, 25 acres / 0.5 acres per court = 50 courts.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that some portion of the remaining area must be reserved for other amenities, then the number would be less.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, it's likely that the expected answer is 50 courts.\n\nHowever, to cover all bases, perhaps I should present both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: all remaining area is used for tennis courts.\n\nTotal area for tennis courts: 50% of 50 acres = 25 acres\n\nNumber of courts: 25 / 0.5 = 50 courts\n\nSecond scenario: assuming that, say, 10 acres are reserved for other amenities, leaving 15 acres for tennis courts.\n\nNumber of courts: 15 / 0.5 = 30 courts\n\nThird scenario: assuming 15 acres for other amenities, leaving 10 acres for tennis courts.\n\nNumber of courts: 10 / 0.5 = 20 courts\n\nWithout specific instructions, it's unclear which scenario to choose.\n\nPerhaps the problem intends for us to assume that all remaining land is used for tennis courts, hence the answer is 50 courts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a standard proportion for such allocations, but I don't have that information.\n\nIn real-life planning, the allocation would depend on various factors, including the intended use of the complex, budget constraints, local regulations, and so on.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, I think the best approach is to assume that the entire remaining area is allocated to tennis courts, unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the number of tennis courts that can be built is 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
