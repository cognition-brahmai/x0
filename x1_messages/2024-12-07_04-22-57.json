        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a bag with 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 5 green balls. That's a total of 4 + 6 + 5 = 15 balls. We're supposed to find the probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball in three consecutive draws without replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once a ball is drawn, it's not put back into the bag. So, the total number of balls decreases with each draw, and the probabilities change accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem is about drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball in three draws. The order in which we draw them isn't specified, so I think we need to consider all possible sequences that result in 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nLet me list out the possible sequences:\n\n1. Red, Red, Blue (RRB)\n\n2. Red, Blue, Red (RBR)\n\n3. Blue, Red, Red (BRR)\n\nThese are the only sequences that give us exactly 2 red and 1 blue ball in three draws.\n\nSince the draws are without replacement, the probability will be different for each draw depending on what's left in the bag.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each sequence separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with sequence RRB:\n\n- First draw: Probability of drawing a red ball. There are 4 red balls out of 15 total balls. So, P(R1) = 4/15.\n\n- Second draw: Probability of drawing another red ball. Now, there are 3 red balls left out of 14 total balls (since we didn't replace the first one). So, P(R2 | R1) = 3/14.\n\n- Third draw: Probability of drawing a blue ball. Now, there are 6 blue balls out of 13 total balls left. So, P(B3 | R1 and R2) = 6/13.\n\nTherefore, the probability for the sequence RRB is (4/15) * (3/14) * (6/13).\n\nNow, for sequence RBR:\n\n- First draw: Probability of drawing a red ball. Again, 4/15.\n\n- Second draw: Probability of drawing a blue ball. Now, there are 6 blue balls out of 14 total balls left (since we drew a red first and didn't replace it). So, P(B2 | R1) = 6/14.\n\n- Third draw: Probability of drawing a red ball. Now, there are 3 red balls left out of 13 total balls. So, P(R3 | R1 and B2) = 3/13.\n\nTherefore, the probability for the sequence RBR is (4/15) * (6/14) * (3/13).\n\nNext, sequence BRR:\n\n- First draw: Probability of drawing a blue ball. There are 6 blue balls out of 15 total balls. So, P(B1) = 6/15.\n\n- Second draw: Probability of drawing a red ball. Now, there are 4 red balls out of 14 total balls left. So, P(R2 | B1) = 4/14.\n\n- Third draw: Probability of drawing another red ball. Now, there are 3 red balls left out of 13 total balls. So, P(R3 | B1 and R2) = 3/13.\n\nTherefore, the probability for the sequence BRR is (6/15) * (4/14) * (3/13).\n\nNow, I need to add up these three probabilities to get the total probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball in any order.\n\nSo, total probability P = P(RRB) + P(RBR) + P(BRR).\n\nLet's calculate each one:\n\nFirst, P(RRB) = (4/15) * (3/14) * (6/13) = (4*3*6)/(15*14*13) = 72 / 2730.\n\nSimilarly, P(RBR) = (4/15) * (6/14) * (3/13) = (4*6*3)/(15*14*13) = 72 / 2730.\n\nAnd P(BRR) = (6/15) * (4/14) * (3/13) = (6*4*3)/(15*14*13) = 72 / 2730.\n\nAdding them up: P = 72/2730 + 72/2730 + 72/2730 = (72*3)/2730 = 216 / 2730.\n\nNow, let's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 6.\n\n216 \u00f7 6 = 36\n\n2730 \u00f7 6 = 455\n\nSo, P = 36 / 455.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave it as a decimal. Let's see:\n\n216 / 2730 \u2248 0.0791.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.0791, or 7.91%.\n\nBut I should check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using combinations, since the order doesn't matter in terms of the final composition of balls drawn.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 15 is C(15,3), where C(n,k) is the combination formula.\n\nC(15,3) = 15! / (3! * (15-3)!) = (15*14*13)/(3*2*1) = 455.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 4 is C(4,2) = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 1 blue ball out of 6 is C(6,1) = 6.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2) * C(6,1) = 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 36 / 455, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is 36/455 or approximately 7.91%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{36}{455}} \\]"
