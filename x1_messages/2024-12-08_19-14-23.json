First, I need to recall some properties of logarithms to simplify this equation.\n\nI remember that there's a property that says log(a) + log(b) equals log(a*b). So, maybe I can combine the two logarithms on the left side using that property.\n\nLet me try that: log(x) + log(2x) = log(x * 2x) = log(2x\u00b2).\n\nNow, the equation becomes: log(2x\u00b2) = 2.\n\nHmm, I need to solve for x here. I know that logarithms have a base, and if the base isn't specified, it's usually 10. So, I'll assume that log here means log base 10.\n\nSo, log base 10 of (2x\u00b2) equals 2.\n\nI recall that if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So, in this case, 10^2 = 2x\u00b2.\n\nThat means 100 = 2x\u00b2.\n\nNow, I can solve for x by isolating it. First, divide both sides by 2: 50 = x\u00b2.\n\nThen, take the square root of both sides: x = sqrt(50) or x = -sqrt(50).\n\nBut wait, logarithms are only defined for positive real numbers, so x has to be positive.\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(50).\n\nI can simplify sqrt(50) as sqrt(25*2) = 5*sqrt(2).\n\nSo, x = 5*sqrt(2).\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If I plug x = 5*sqrt(2) back into the original equation:\n\nlog(5*sqrt(2)) + log(2*(5*sqrt(2))) = log(5*sqrt(2)) + log(10*sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, using the property log(a) + log(b) = log(a*b), this becomes log(5*sqrt(2)*10*sqrt(2)) = log(5*10*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = log(50*2) = log(100) = 2.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the solution is x = 5*sqrt(2).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
