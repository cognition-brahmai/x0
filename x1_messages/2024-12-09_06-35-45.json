        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are two boxes: the first one has 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, and the second one has 8 red balls and 6 blue balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick one ball from each box, both balls will be the same color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for both balls to be the same color. That can happen in two ways: either both balls are red or both balls are blue. So, I think I need to calculate the probability of both balls being red and the probability of both balls being blue, then add those probabilities together to get the total probability of both balls being the same color.\n\nLet me start by finding the probability that both balls are red. For that, I need to find the probability of picking a red ball from the first box and a red ball from the second box.\n\nIn the first box, there are 5 red balls and a total of 5 + 7 = 12 balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball from the first box is 5/12.\n\nIn the second box, there are 8 red balls and a total of 8 + 6 = 14 balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball from the second box is 8/14, which simplifies to 4/7.\n\nSince these are independent events, I can multiply the probabilities together to get the probability of both events happening. So, the probability that both balls are red is (5/12) * (4/7).\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n(5/12) * (4/7) = (5 * 4) / (12 * 7) = 20 / 84 = 5/21.\n\nOkay, that's the probability that both balls are red.\n\nNext, I need to find the probability that both balls are blue.\n\nSimilarly, for the first box, there are 7 blue balls out of 12 total balls, so the probability of picking a blue ball from the first box is 7/12.\n\nFor the second box, there are 6 blue balls out of 14 total balls, so the probability of picking a blue ball from the second box is 6/14, which simplifies to 3/7.\n\nAgain, since these are independent events, I multiply the probabilities: (7/12) * (3/7) = (7 * 3) / (12 * 7) = 21 / 84 = 7/28 = 1/4.\n\nWait, 21/84 simplifies to 7/28, which further simplifies to 1/4. So, the probability that both balls are blue is 1/4.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that both balls are the same color, I add the probability that both are red and the probability that both are blue.\n\nSo, total probability = probability both red + probability both blue = 5/21 + 1/4.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 21 and 4, and the least common multiple of 21 and 4 is 84.\n\nSo, converting both fractions to have a denominator of 84:\n\n5/21 = (5 * 4) / (21 * 4) = 20/84\n\n1/4 = (1 * 21) / (4 * 21) = 21/84\n\nNow, adding them together: 20/84 + 21/84 = 41/84.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls will be the same color is 41/84.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to express this fraction? Let's see if 41 and 84 have any common factors.\n\n41 is a prime number, and it doesn't divide into 84, so 41/84 is already in its simplest form.\n\nSo, the final answer is 41/84.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if I've made any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the individual probabilities to confirm.\n\nFirst, probability both red: (5/12) * (4/7) = 20/84 = 5/21. That seems correct.\n\nProbability both blue: (7/12) * (3/7) = 21/84 = 1/4. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding them together: 20/84 + 21/84 = 41/84. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of ways to pick two balls of the same color and divide by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick one ball from each box is 12 * 14 = 168.\n\nNumber of ways to pick two red balls: 5 (from first box) * 8 (from second box) = 40.\n\nNumber of ways to pick two blue balls: 7 (from first box) * 6 (from second box) = 42.\n\nSo, total number of favorable outcomes is 40 + 42 = 82.\n\nTherefore, probability is 82/168.\n\nSimplifying 82/168: divide numerator and denominator by 2, get 41/84. Same as before.\n\nSo, yeah, 41/84 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{41}{84}} \\]"
