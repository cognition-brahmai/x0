        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what the mean and median are:\n\n1. **Mean** (average): It's the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers.\n\n2. **Median**: It's the middle number when the numbers are sorted. If there's an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nSo, our function should take an array of integers and return an object with these two values.\n\nLet's think about the steps we need to follow:\n\n1. Calculate the mean:\n\na. Sum all the numbers in the array.\n\nb. Divide the sum by the number of elements.\n\n2. Calculate the median:\n\na. Sort the array in ascending order.\n\nb. If the array has an odd number of elements, pick the middle one.\n\nc. If the array has an even number of elements, take the average of the two middle elements.\n\n3. Handle edge cases:\n\na. Empty array: Maybe return { mean: undefined, median: undefined } or throw an error.\n\nb. Single element: The mean and median should both be that single element.\n\nLet's consider how to handle the edge cases. For an empty array, it might make sense to return undefined for both mean and median since there are no elements to calculate them from. For a single element, as mentioned, both mean and median are that element.\n\nLet's sketch out a rough version of the function:\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction calculateMeanAndMedian(arr) {\n\nif (arr.length === 0) {\n\nreturn { mean: undefined, median: undefined };\n\n}\n\nconst sum = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n\nconst mean = sum / arr.length;\n\nconst sortedArr = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\nconst mid = Math.floor(sortedArr.length / 2);\n\nlet median;\n\nif (sortedArr.length % 2 === 0) {\n\nmedian = (sortedArr[mid - 1] + sortedArr[mid]) / 2;\n\n} else {\n\nmedian = sortedArr[mid];\n\n}\n\nreturn { mean, median };\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. Let's test this function with some examples to see if it works.\n\n**Test case 1: Empty array**\n\n```javascript\n\nconsole.log(calculateMeanAndMedian([])); // Should return { mean: undefined, median: undefined }\n\n```\n\n**Test case 2: Single element**\n\n```javascript\n\nconsole.log(calculateMeanAndMedian([5])); // Should return { mean: 5, median: 5 }\n\n```\n\n**Test case 3: Odd number of elements**\n\n```javascript\n\nconsole.log(calculateMeanAndMedian([1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9])); // Should return { mean: ~5.428, median: 6 }\n\n```\n\n**Test case 4: Even number of elements**\n\n```javascript\n\nconsole.log(calculateMeanAndMedian([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])); // Should return { mean: 3.5, median: 3.5 }\n\n```\n\n**Test case 5: Negative numbers**\n\n```javascript\n\nconsole.log(calculateMeanAndMedian([-1, -2, -3, -4])); // Should return { mean: -2.5, median: -2.5 }\n\n```\n\n**Test case 6: All elements are the same**\n\n```javascript\n\nconsole.log(calculateMeanAndMedian([2, 2, 2, 2])); // Should return { mean: 2, median: 2 }\n\n```\n\nThese test cases should cover most scenarios. Let's run them through our function to verify.\n\nWait a minute, in the function above, I used `arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b)` to sort the array. This is important because we don't want to mutate the original array. Also, sorting numerically is crucial for calculating the median correctly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the input is an array of integers, but to make the function more robust, we might want to add some type checking or handle non-integer values, but since the prompt specifies an array of integers, we can assume that the input will be as such.\n\nLet's also think about performance. The time complexity for sorting is O(n log n), which is acceptable for this kind of operation. Since we're dealing with arrays, which can be of significant size, but for the mean, we're just summing up the elements, which is O(n). So overall, the bottleneck is the sorting for the median.\n\nIs there a way to optimize this? For large datasets, calculating the median without sorting the entire array could be more efficient. We could use a heap or some partial sort, but for simplicity and given that the prompt is likely expecting a straightforward solution, sticking with sorting is fine.\n\nAnother consideration is floating-point precision. When calculating the mean or the median, we might get floating-point numbers. JavaScript handles this naturally since division results in a float. So no issues there.\n\nLet's also think about the edge case where the array contains very large numbers that might cause integer overflows or precision issues. JavaScript numbers have a precision up to 15 decimal digits, and for very large numbers, they might lose precision. However, since the prompt specifies an array of integers, and JavaScript can handle integers up to 2^53 - 1 accurately, we should be fine for most practical purposes.\n\nAlright, I think our function is solid. Let's write it cleanly and make sure it's well-documented.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a JavaScript function that accepts an array of integers and returns an object containing the mean (average) and median of the array elements. The function should also handle edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays with only one element.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mean Calculation**:\n   - Sum all the elements in the array.\n   - Divide the sum by the number of elements in the array.\n\n2. **Median Calculation**:\n   - Sort the array in ascending order.\n   - If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element.\n   - If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - For an empty array, return `{ mean: undefined, median: undefined }`.\n   - For a single element, both mean and median are that element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```javascript\nfunction calculateMeanAndMedian(arr) {\n    // Handle empty array\n    if (arr.length === 0) {\n        return { mean: undefined, median: undefined };\n    }\n\n    // Calculate mean\n    const sum = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n    const mean = sum / arr.length;\n\n    // Calculate median\n    const sortedArr = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    const mid = Math.floor(sortedArr.length / 2);\n    let median;\n    if (sortedArr.length % 2 === 0) {\n        median = (sortedArr[mid - 1] + sortedArr[mid]) / 2;\n    } else {\n        median = sortedArr[mid];\n    }\n\n    return { mean, median };\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mean Calculation**:\n   - We use the `reduce` method to sum up all elements in the array and then divide by the length of the array to get the mean.\n\n2. **Median Calculation**:\n   - We create a sorted copy of the array to determine the median without modifying the original array.\n   - We find the middle index of the sorted array.\n   - If the array length is even, we average the two middle elements.\n   - If the array length is odd, the median is the middle element.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the array is empty, we return undefined for both mean and median.\n   - If the array has one element, that element is both the mean and the median.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is robust and handles various scenarios effectively."
