        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got 10 people in a room, and each one knows at least 3 others. We need to figure out the minimum number of friendships in this setup.\n\nFirst off, it's important to understand what's being asked. A friendship here is a connection between two people who know each other. Since friendships are mutual, it's an undirected relationship. So, if person A knows person B, that counts as one friendship, not two.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimum number of such friendships given that each person knows at least three others.\n\nOne way to approach this is to model it as a graph, where each person is a vertex, and each friendship is an edge connecting two vertices. So, we have a graph with 10 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of at least 3 (since each person knows at least 3 others).\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum number of edges in such a graph.\n\nA fundamental theorem in graph theory is that the sum of all vertex degrees in an undirected graph is equal to twice the number of edges. This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nSo, if we denote the number of edges as E, and the degrees of the vertices as d1, d2, ..., d10, then:\n\nd1 + d2 + ... + d10 = 2E\n\nGiven that each di >= 3, the minimum sum of degrees is 10 * 3 = 30.\n\nTherefore, 2E >= 30, which implies E >= 15.\n\nSo, is 15 the answer? Not necessarily, because we need to ensure that such a graph exists where each vertex has at least degree 3, and the total number of edges is 15.\n\nIn graph theory, a graph where each vertex has the same degree is called a regular graph. So, a 3-regular graph on 10 vertices would have each vertex connected to exactly 3 others, and the total number of edges would be (10 * 3)/2 = 15.\n\nBut does such a graph exist? Yes, it does. For example, the Petersen graph is a well-known 3-regular graph with 10 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of friendships is 15.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Is there a way to have fewer than 15 edges while still ensuring that each person knows at least 3 others?\n\nSuppose we try to construct a graph with 14 edges. Then, 2E = 28, so the sum of degrees is 28. With 10 vertices, if each has at least degree 3, the minimum sum is 30, which is greater than 28. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have a graph with 14 edges where each vertex has degree at least 3.\n\nHence, the minimum number of friendships is indeed 15.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about this in terms of the handshake lemma. Each friendship is like a handshake between two people. The total number of handshakes is equal to half the sum of the degrees of all vertices.\n\nGiven that each person shakes hands with at least 3 others, the minimum total number of handshakes is (10 * 3)/2 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
