        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box with red balls and blue balls. The probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, and there are 9 red balls in the box. I need to find out how many blue balls there are.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means in this context. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls in the box.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nProbability of red ball = Number of red balls / Total number of balls\n\nI know the probability is 1/3, and the number of red balls is 9. So I can plug those values into the equation:\n\n1/3 = 9 / Total number of balls\n\nNow, I need to find the total number of balls. Let's call the total number of balls \"T\". So the equation becomes:\n\n1/3 = 9 / T\n\nTo find T, I can cross-multiply:\n\n1 * T = 3 * 9\n\nT = 27\n\nSo, the total number of balls in the box is 27.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the number of blue balls. If there are 27 balls in total and 9 of them are red, then the number of blue balls must be the total minus the red balls.\n\nNumber of blue balls = Total number of balls - Number of red balls\n\nNumber of blue balls = 27 - 9\n\nNumber of blue balls = 18\n\nSo, there are 18 blue balls in the box.\n\nLet me double-check that. If there are 9 red balls and 18 blue balls, the total is indeed 27. The probability of picking a red ball would be 9/27, which simplifies to 1/3. That matches the given probability, so my answer seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of ratios. The probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, which means that for every 3 balls, 1 is red and 2 are blue. So, the ratio of red to blue is 1:2.\n\nGiven that there are 9 red balls, I can set up a proportion:\n\nRed balls / Blue balls = 1 / 2\n\n9 / Blue balls = 1 / 2\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n1 * Blue balls = 2 * 9\n\nBlue balls = 18\n\nAgain, I get 18 blue balls, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the probability of picking a blue ball would be 2/3, since there are twice as many blue balls as red balls. But the question only gave the probability of picking a red ball, so I don't need to calculate that, but it's good to understand the relationship.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 18 blue balls in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
