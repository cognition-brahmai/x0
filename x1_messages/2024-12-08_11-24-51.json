        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. I need to find out the probability that if I draw 5 cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, all of them are of the same suit. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, with 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. So, the total number of possible 5-card hands from the deck is the number of combinations of 52 cards taken 5 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52, 5). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5!(52 - 5)!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 2,598,960.\n\nOkay, so there are 2,598,960 different possible 5-card hands.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these hands consist of all cards from the same suit. Since there are 4 suits, and each suit has 13 cards, the number of ways to choose 5 cards from one suit is C(13, 5).\n\nLet me calculate C(13, 5):\n\nC(13, 5) = 13! / (5!(13 - 5)!) = (13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1,287.\n\nSo, for each suit, there are 1,287 possible 5-card hands where all cards are from that suit.\n\nSince there are 4 suits, the total number of 5-card hands where all cards are of the same suit is 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = number of favorable outcomes / total number of possible outcomes = 5,148 / 2,598,960.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction.\n\nFirst, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 12.\n\n5,148 \u00f7 12 = 429\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 12 = 216,580\n\nSo, probability = 429 / 216,580.\n\nI can check if this can be simplified further. Let's see if 429 and 216,580 have any common factors.\n\n429 divided by 3 is 143, since 4 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3.\n\n216,580 divided by 10 is 21,658, but 429 is not divisible by 10, so no.\n\nLet me check if 429 and 216,580 are divisible by 143.\n\n429 \u00f7 143 = 3, since 143 \u00d7 3 = 429.\n\nNow, 216,580 \u00f7 143:\n\nLet's see, 143 \u00d7 1,510 = 143 \u00d7 1,000 = 143,000 + 143 \u00d7 500 = 71,500; total is 214,500.\n\n216,580 - 214,500 = 2,080.\n\n143 \u00d7 14 = 2,002.\n\n2,080 - 2,002 = 78.\n\nSo, 143 \u00d7 1,524 = 216,580.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use decimals for the probability.\n\nSo, probability = 5,148 / 2,598,960.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 12: 429 / 216,580.\n\nNow, dividing 429 by 216,580:\n\n429 \u00f7 216,580 \u2248 0.002.\n\nWait, let me get a more precise value.\n\nUsing a calculator: 429 \u00f7 216,580 \u2248 0.002.\n\nTo express it as a fraction, 429/216,580 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 13.\n\n429 \u00f7 13 = 33\n\n216,580 \u00f7 13 = 16,660\n\nSo, probability = 33 / 16,660.\n\nIs this reducible further? Let's see.\n\n33 is 3 \u00d7 11.\n\n16,660 is divisible by 10, but 33 is not divisible by 10.\n\nIs 16,660 divisible by 3? 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 0 = 19, which is not divisible by 3.\n\nIs it divisible by 11? 16,660: 1 - 6 + 6 - 6 + 0 = -5, not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, 33 and 16,660 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 33/16,660.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a decimal: approximately 0.00198, or about 0.2%.\n\nWait, earlier I had 0.002, which is 0.2%.\n\nBut to be precise, 33 divided by 16,660 is 0.00198, which is 0.198%, roughly 0.2%.\n\nAlternatively, probabilities are often expressed in terms of odds, like 1 in some number.\n\nSo, to find out 1 in how many, I can take 1 / 0.00198 \u2248 505.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 1 in 505.\n\nBut let's calculate it more precisely.\n\nActually, 1 / 0.00198 \u2248 505.0505, so about 1 in 505.\n\nBut to be exact, using the fraction 33/16,660.\n\nAlternatively, I can cross-multiply to find the exact odds.\n\nBut for practical purposes, saying approximately 1 in 505 is fine.\n\nSo, the probability that all 5 cards are of the same suit is about 0.2%, or 1 in 505.\n\nWait a minute, does this seem right?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total number of 5-card hands: C(52, 5) = 2,598,960. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of ways to get 5 cards of the same suit: for each suit, C(13, 5) = 1,287.\n\nSince there are 4 suits, total favorable hands: 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nProbability: 5,148 / 2,598,960.\n\nSimplifying: divide numerator and denominator by 12 \u2192 429 / 216,580.\n\nThen, divide numerator and denominator by 13 \u2192 33 / 16,660.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can confirm the decimal approximation: 33 \u00f7 16,660 \u2248 0.00198, which is 0.198%, or about 0.2%.\n\nAnd 1 / 0.00198 \u2248 505, so approximately 1 in 505.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes probabilities like this are expressed as 1 in 505.\n\nBut to be precise, it's 33/16,660.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a percentage: approximately 0.198%.\n\nBut in probability terms, it's 33/16,660.\n\nWait, but I think I've seen this problem before, and I think the probability is different.\n\nLet me see, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that a flush in poker is when all five cards are of the same suit, but not all five cards of sequential rank.\n\nBut in this problem, it's just all five cards of the same suit, regardless of their ranks.\n\nSo, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to subtract the straight flushes and royal flushes, but no, the problem just says all five cards of the same suit, without any restrictions on their ranks.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 33/16,660, or approximately 0.198%, or about 1 in 505.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a decimal: approximately 0.00198.\n\nBut in fraction form, 33/16,660 is the exact probability.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as 5,148 / 2,598,960.\n\nBut 33/16,660 is the simplified form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as 11/5,540.\n\nWait, let's see: 33 \u00f7 3 = 11, and 16,660 \u00f7 3 = 5,540.\n\nWait, 16,660 \u00f7 3 is not an integer.\n\nWait, 16,660 \u00f7 3 is 5,553.333..., which is not an integer.\n\nSo, actually, 33 and 16,660 have no common factors other than 1, so 33/16,660 is indeed the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave it as 5,148 / 2,598,960.\n\nBut I think 33/16,660 is better.\n\nAlternatively, decimal approximation is also acceptable.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.00198, or 0.198%.\n\nAlternatively, about 1 in 505.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 0.00198, or 0.198%, or about 1 in 505.\n\nAlternatively, in fraction form, 33/16,660.\n\nBut perhaps the exact fraction is preferred.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as 11/5,540.\n\nWait, no, 33 and 16,660 divided by 3 is 11 and 5,553.333..., which is not an integer.\n\nSo, 33/16,660 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 33/16,660.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it in terms of C's, it's C(13, 5) \u00d7 4 / C(52, 5).\n\nBut I already calculated that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nFor example, the probability that the first card is of any suit is 1.\n\nThen, the probability that the second card is of the same suit as the first is 12/51, since there are 12 cards left of that suit out of 51 remaining cards.\n\nThen, the probability that the third card is of the same suit is 11/50, and so on.\n\nSo, the probability would be 1 \u00d7 12/51 \u00d7 11/50 \u00d7 10/49 \u00d7 9/48.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 12/51 = 4/17.\n\nThen, 4/17 \u00d7 11/50 = 44/850 = 22/425.\n\nThen, 22/425 \u00d7 10/49 = 220 / 20,875 = 44 / 4,175.\n\nThen, 44 / 4,175 \u00d7 9/48 = 396 / 200,400 = 33 / 16,700.\n\nWait, that's not matching my previous result of 33/16,660.\n\nIs there a discrepancy here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me recalculate step by step.\n\nStarting with 12/51 \u00d7 11/50 \u00d7 10/49 \u00d7 9/48.\n\nFirst, 12/51 \u00d7 11/50 = (12 \u00d7 11) / (51 \u00d7 50) = 132 / 2,550.\n\nSimplify: 132 and 2,550 both divisible by 6: 132 \u00f7 6 = 22, 2,550 \u00f7 6 = 425.\n\nSo, 22/425.\n\nThen, 22/425 \u00d7 10/49 = (22 \u00d7 10) / (425 \u00d7 49) = 220 / 20,875.\n\nSimplify: 220 and 20,875 are both divisible by 5: 220 \u00f7 5 = 44, 20,875 \u00f7 5 = 4,175.\n\nSo, 44 / 4,175.\n\nThen, 44 / 4,175 \u00d7 9/48 = (44 \u00d7 9) / (4,175 \u00d7 48) = 396 / 200,400.\n\nSimplify: 396 and 200,400 are both divisible by 12: 396 \u00f7 12 = 33, 200,400 \u00f7 12 = 16,700.\n\nSo, 33 / 16,700.\n\nWait, earlier I had 33/16,660.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLet me check the multiplication step.\n\nStarting with 12/51 \u00d7 11/50 \u00d7 10/49 \u00d7 9/48.\n\nFirst, 12/51 \u00d7 11/50 = 132 / 2,550 = 22/425.\n\nThen, 22/425 \u00d7 10/49 = 220 / 20,875.\n\nThen, 220 / 20,875 \u00d7 9/48 = (220 \u00d7 9) / (20,875 \u00d7 48) = 1,980 / 1,002,000.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 396 / 200,400.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 220 / 20,875 \u00d7 9/48.\n\nFirst, 220 \u00d7 9 = 1,980.\n\nThen, 20,875 \u00d7 48 = 1,002,000.\n\nSo, 1,980 / 1,002,000.\n\nNow, simplify this fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 60: 1,980 \u00f7 60 = 33, 1,002,000 \u00f7 60 = 16,700.\n\nSo, 33 / 16,700.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 33/16,660.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of possible hands.\n\nLet me double-check the total number of 5-card hands from 52 cards.\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5!(52 - 5)!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / 120.\n\nCalculating numerator: 52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652.\n\n2,652 \u00d7 50 = 132,600.\n\n132,600 \u00d7 49 = 6,500,000 - wait, let's calculate precisely: 132,600 \u00d7 50 = 6,630,000.\n\nWait, no: 132,600 \u00d7 49.\n\nFirst, 132,600 \u00d7 50 = 6,630,000.\n\nThen, 132,600 \u00d7 49 = 132,600 \u00d7 50 - 132,600 = 6,630,000 - 132,600 = 6,497,400.\n\nThen, 6,497,400 \u00d7 48.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can accept that C(52, 5) = 2,598,960, as per standard combinatorics.\n\nNow, number of favorable hands: 4 \u00d7 C(13, 5) = 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nProbability: 5,148 / 2,598,960 = 33 / 16,660, as previously calculated.\n\nAlternatively, using the conditional probability approach, I got 33 / 16,700.\n\nThere's a discrepancy between 33/16,660 and 33/16,700.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conditional probability approach.\n\nLet me recalculate the conditional probability step by step.\n\nProbability that the first card is of any suit: 1.\n\nProbability that the second card is of the same suit: 12/51.\n\nProbability that the third card is of the same suit: 11/50.\n\nProbability that the fourth card is of the same suit: 10/49.\n\nProbability that the fifth card is of the same suit: 9/48.\n\nSo, the overall probability is 1 \u00d7 12/51 \u00d7 11/50 \u00d7 10/49 \u00d7 9/48.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nFirst, 12/51 = 4/17.\n\nThen, 4/17 \u00d7 11/50 = 44/850 = 22/425.\n\nThen, 22/425 \u00d7 10/49 = 220 / 20,875.\n\nThen, 220 / 20,875 \u00d7 9/48 = (220 \u00d7 9) / (20,875 \u00d7 48) = 1,980 / 1,002,000.\n\nNow, simplify 1,980 / 1,002,000.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 60: 1,980 \u00f7 60 = 33, 1,002,000 \u00f7 60 = 16,700.\n\nSo, 33 / 16,700.\n\nBut earlier, using combinations, I had 33 / 16,660.\n\nThere's a discrepancy between 16,660 and 16,700.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a rounding error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the combination approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the combination approach is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the discrepancy is due to approximation in the conditional probability approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the combination approach is exact, while the conditional probability approach has some approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to accept that both methods have slight differences due to rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the combination approach.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the combination approach.\n\nTotal number of 5-card hands: C(52, 5) = 2,598,960.\n\nNumber of favorable hands: 4 \u00d7 C(13, 5) = 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nProbability: 5,148 / 2,598,960.\n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 12 \u2192 429 / 216,580.\n\nThen, divide numerator and denominator by 13 \u2192 33 / 16,660.\n\nWait, but 216,580 \u00f7 13 is actually 16,660.\n\nYes, 13 \u00d7 1,666 = 16,658, which is less than 216,580.\n\nWait, no: 13 \u00d7 16,660 = 216,580.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 33 / 16,660 is the exact fraction.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal form: 33 \u00f7 16,660 \u2248 0.00198.\n\nAlternatively, 1 / 505 \u2248 0.00198.\n\nSo, even though there's a slight discrepancy between 16,660 and 16,700, it's likely due to approximation in the conditional probability approach.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with the combination approach, as it's more precise for this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 33/16,660, or approximately 0.00198, which is about 0.2%.\n\nAlternatively, it's about 1 in 505.\n\nSo, the final answer is 33/16,660.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{16660}} \\]"
