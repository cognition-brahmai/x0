        "content": "Upon the lap of Nature, where I lie,\n\nA pilgrim soul, in solitude I stray,\n\nThrough fields that laugh with gold, or weep in sigh,\n\nAs Autumn's breath doth gently steal away.\n\nYet, not in sorrow, for her fruitful reign\n\nHath graced the earth with bounteous plenty's store;\n\nThe trees, in vestments rich, their leaves retain,\n\nA final blaze before winter's cold lore.\n\nO'er hill and dale, the landscape doth transmute,\n\nFrom verdant hues to amber, russet, red;\n\nEach leaf a flame, in sunlight's gentle shoot,\n\nA fleeting dance, ere earthy beds are spread.\n\nAnd as the seasons turn, so too my heart\n\nDoth feel the ebb and flow of life's sweet art."
