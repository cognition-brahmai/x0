He's famous for his book \"Walden,\" which is about his experiences living in nature and his philosophical views on simplicity and self-reliance. The term \"Pond\" refers to a small body of still water, and \"Walden Pond\" is the specific pond where Thoreau lived and wrote. So, Thoreau and Pond are connected through his work and the location of his experiment in simple living.\n"
