        "content": "Let's see. The store sells shirts for $20 each and pants for $30 each. The customer is buying 5 shirts and 3 pairs of pants. I need to find out how much they will spend before tax.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total cost of the shirts. Since each shirt costs $20 and the customer is buying 5 shirts, I can multiply 20 by 5. That should give me the total cost for the shirts.\n\n20 \u00d7 5 = 100\n\nSo, the shirts will cost $100 in total.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total cost of the pants. Each pair of pants costs $30, and the customer is buying 3 pairs. So, I'll multiply 30 by 3.\n\n30 \u00d7 3 = 90\n\nTherefore, the pants will cost $90 in total.\n\nNow, to find the total amount spent before tax, I need to add the total cost of the shirts and the total cost of the pants together.\n\n100 + 90 = 190\n\nSo, the customer will spend $190 before tax.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other cost involved here, like maybe a discount or something? The question doesn't mention any discounts or additional fees, so I think $190 is the final amount before tax.\n\nJust to double-check, let me go through the calculations again.\n\nShirts: 5 \u00d7 $20 = $100\n\nPants: 3 \u00d7 $30 = $90\n\nTotal: $100 + $90 = $190\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
