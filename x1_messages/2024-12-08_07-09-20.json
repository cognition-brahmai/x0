        "content": "Let's see. There's this snail in a 30-foot deep well. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slides back down 2 feet. I need to figure out how many days it takes for the snail to get out of the well.\n\nFirst, I should understand the net progress the snail makes each day. During the day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slides back 2 feet. So, the net gain each day is 3 feet minus 2 feet, which is 1 foot per day.\n\nIf it's just 1 foot per day, then for a 30-foot well, it would take 30 days to climb out. But wait, I need to think carefully because the snail might reach the top somewhere during the day before sliding back down at night.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Each full day and night cycle, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot. So, after 27 days, the snail would have climbed 27 feet (since 27 days times 1 foot per day equals 27 feet).\n\nOn the 28th day, the snail climbs up 3 feet during the day, which would take it from 27 feet to 30 feet. At this point, it has reached the top of the well during the day. Since it has already reached the top, it wouldn't slide back down that night.\n\nTherefore, the snail would escape the well on the 28th day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the snail climbs 3 feet during the day and reaches 30 feet, then it's out of the well, and the night time sliding back doesn't apply because it's already out.\n\nSo, yes, after 27 days, it's at 27 feet. On the 28th day, it climbs up 3 feet to 30 feet and escapes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 28 days.\n\nBut let's consider another perspective. Suppose the well is only 3 feet deep. The snail climbs 3 feet during the day and escapes on the first day. It doesn't slide back because it's already out.\n\nSimilarly, in a 5-foot well, the snail climbs 3 feet during the day, reaches the top, and escapes on the first day.\n\nWait, but in these cases, the snail escapes earlier than the number of days calculated by the net progress method.\n\nWait, no. In a 3-foot well, the snail climbs 3 feet on the first day and escapes. In a 5-foot well, it climbs 3 feet on the first day, reaches the top, and escapes.\n\nBut in our original problem, the well is 30 feet deep. Using the net progress method, it would be 27 days to reach 27 feet, and on the 28th day, it climbs the remaining 3 feet and escapes.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that every day it makes a net progress of 1 foot, except for the last day when it climbs out, then the number of days is the total depth minus the day climb, divided by the net progress, plus one for the last day.\n\nWait, that sounds complicated. Maybe I should use a formula.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Well depth: 30 feet\n\n- Daily climb: 3 feet\n\n- Night slide: 2 feet\n\n- Net daily progress: 1 foot\n\nBut as we saw, on the last day, the snail climbs out during the day and doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, the snail needs to reach a point where, with a 3-foot climb during the day, it can get out.\n\nSo, effectively, it needs to reach 30 - 3 = 27 feet by the end of a day before the last day.\n\nThen, on the next day, it climbs the remaining 3 feet and escapes.\n\nSo, to reach 27 feet with a net progress of 1 foot per day, it would take 27 days.\n\nThen, on the 28th day, it climbs out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 28 days.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the snail needing to cover 30 feet, with each day contributing a net progress of 1 foot, but on the day it reaches the top, it doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, the number of days is the smallest integer n such that the snail's position at the end of the nth day is at or above the well's depth.\n\nBut in this case, since the snail climbs 3 feet during the day and then slides back 2 feet at night, the position at the end of each day is increased by 1 foot.\n\nSo, after n days, the snail has climbed n feet.\n\nWe need n to be such that n >= 30.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the snail climbs 3 feet during the day and then slides back 2 feet at night, so net progress is 1 foot per day.\n\nHowever, on the day it reaches or exceeds the well's depth during the day climb, it escapes without sliding back.\n\nSo, on day n, the snail climbs 3 feet during the day, reaching a height of (n - 1) + 3 = n + 2 feet.\n\nIf n + 2 >= 30, then the snail escapes on day n.\n\nSo, n + 2 >= 30 => n >= 28.\n\nTherefore, the snail escapes on day 28.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAt the end of day 27, the snail has climbed 27 feet (since net progress is 1 foot per day).\n\nOn day 28, it climbs 3 feet during the day, reaching 30 feet, and escapes.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each day the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot, except for the last day, where it climbs out, then the number of days is 30 - 3 = 27 days to reach 27 feet, plus one day to climb the last 3 feet, totaling 28 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 28 days.\n\nBut let's consider another scenario to verify.\n\nSuppose the well is 5 feet deep.\n\nUsing the same logic:\n\nThe snail needs to reach 5 feet.\n\nAfter day 1: climbs 3 feet, slides back 2 feet, at 1 foot net.\n\nAfter day 2: climbs to 4 feet, slides back to 2 feet.\n\nAfter day 3: climbs to 5 feet and escapes.\n\nSo, it takes 3 days, which matches the formula: n = 5 - 3 = 2 days to reach 2 feet, plus one day to climb the last 3 feet, totaling 3 days.\n\nSimilarly, for a 3-foot well:\n\nAfter day 1: climbs 3 feet and escapes.\n\nWhich matches n = 3 - 3 = 0 days, plus one day to climb the last 3 feet, totaling 1 day.\n\nSo, the formula seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, for a 30-foot well, it takes 30 - 3 = 27 days to reach 27 feet, plus one day to climb the last 3 feet, totaling 28 days.\n\nThus, the answer is 28 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
