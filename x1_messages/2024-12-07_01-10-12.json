        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this store that gives a discount if you buy a bunch of items at once. Specifically, if you buy 10 items or more, you get a 15% discount. Each item costs $25, and someone decides to buy 12 items. I need to figure out how much they end up paying with the discount.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the total cost without any discount. Since each item is $25 and they're buying 12, I can multiply 25 by 12 to get the total cost before the discount.\n\nSo, 25 times 12. Let me do that math. 25 times 10 is 250, and 25 times 2 is 50. So, 250 plus 50 is 300. So, the total cost without the discount is $300.\n\nNow, since they're buying 12 items, which is more than 10, they get a 15% discount. I need to calculate what 15% of $300 is and then subtract that from the total cost.\n\nFirst, finding 15% of 300. I know that percent means per hundred, so 15% is the same as 15/100 or 0.15.\n\nSo, 0.15 times 300. Let me calculate that. 0.15 times 300 is 45. So, the discount is $45.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the total cost before discount: 300 minus 45 is 255.\n\nTherefore, the person pays $255 for 12 items.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to calculate it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the cost per item after the discount and then multiply by the number of items.\n\nFirst, find the discount per item. Each item is $25, and there's a 15% discount on each.\n\nSo, 15% of $25 is 0.15 times 25, which is 3.75. So, each item has a $3.75 discount.\n\nTherefore, the price per item after discount is 25 minus 3.75, which is 21.25.\n\nNow, multiply the discounted price per item by the number of items: 21.25 times 12.\n\nLet me calculate that. 21.25 times 10 is 212.5, and 21.25 times 2 is 42.5. So, 212.5 plus 42.5 is 255.\n\nSo, again, the total cost is $255.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a method where you calculate the total cost by multiplying the original price by the percentage you have to pay after discount.\n\nSince there's a 15% discount, that means you pay 100% minus 15%, which is 85% of the total cost.\n\nSo, 85% of $300.\n\n85% is 0.85, so 0.85 times 300 is 255.\n\nAgain, $255.\n\nAll three methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that's the correct total the person has to pay.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Total cost without discount: 12 items * $25 = $300\n\n- Discount: 15% of $300 = $45\n\n- Total cost with discount: $300 - $45 = $255\n\nOr\n\n- Discount per item: 15% of $25 = $3.75\n\n- Discounted price per item: $25 - $3.75 = $21.25\n\n- Total cost for 12 items: 12 * $21.25 = $255\n\nOr\n\n- Pay 85% of total cost: 0.85 * $300 = $255\n\nAll methods confirm the total payment is $255.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{255} \\]"
