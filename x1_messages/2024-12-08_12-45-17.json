        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units every day, and each unit sells for $20. We need to find out how much money the factory makes in one week, and it works seven days a week. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many units the factory produces in a week. Since it makes 500 units each day and works seven days a week, I can multiply 500 by 7 to get the total units per week.\n\n500 units/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 3500 units/week\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 3500 units in a week.\n\nNext, each unit sells for $20. To find out the total revenue, I need to multiply the number of units by the price per unit.\n\n3500 units \u00d7 $20/unit = $70,000\n\nSo, the factory's revenue for one week is $70,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the daily revenue first and then multiply by seven for the weekly revenue.\n\nDaily revenue = 500 units/day \u00d7 $20/unit = $10,000/day\n\nThen, weekly revenue = $10,000/day \u00d7 7 days/week = $70,000/week\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the factory makes $70,000 in one week.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. The problem says \"assuming it operates seven days a week,\" so I'm assuming there are no holidays or downtime. Also, it doesn't mention any costs or expenses, so I'm only calculating revenue, not profit.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the units to make sure they make sense.\n\nUnits produced per day: 500 units/day\n\nSelling price: $20/unit\n\nRevenue per day: 500 units/day \u00d7 $20/unit = $10,000/day\n\nRevenue per week: $10,000/day \u00d7 7 days/week = $70,000/week\n\nEverything seems consistent. I think $70,000 is the correct weekly revenue for the factory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70000} \\]"
