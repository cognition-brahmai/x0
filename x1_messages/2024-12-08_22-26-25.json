In this novel, Miss Havisham is a reclusive and mysterious character who, after being jilted at the altar, stops all clocks in her house and wears her wedding dress perpetually. She is often associated with the color yellow or decayed colors, reflecting her stagnant and deteriorating state. However, if you're thinking of a specific color that she strongly favors, it might be yellow or faded white, given the description of her attire and surroundings. If you have more specifics or another color in mind, feel free to share!"
