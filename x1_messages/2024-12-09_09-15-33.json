        "content": "Let's see. The factory normally produces 1000 widgets every day. But on Mondays, it increases production by 50%. So, first, I need to figure out how many widgets it produces on Mondays.\n\nIf it's a 50% increase on Mondays, that means it's producing an additional half of its normal daily production on that day. So, 50% of 1000 widgets is 500 widgets. Therefore, on Mondays, it produces 1000 + 500 = 1500 widgets.\n\nNow, a week has 7 days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Since the increased production is only on Mondays, for the other 6 days, it produces the normal 1000 widgets per day.\n\nSo, to find the total production for the week, I need to add the production from Monday to Sunday.\n\nMonday: 1500 widgets\n\nTuesday: 1000 widgets\n\nWednesday: 1000 widgets\n\nThursday: 1000 widgets\n\nFriday: 1000 widgets\n\nSaturday: 1000 widgets\n\nSunday: 1000 widgets\n\nAdding them up: 1500 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000.\n\nAlternatively, since six days are the same, I can calculate 6 * 1000 = 6000 widgets, and then add the Monday production: 6000 + 1500 = 7500 widgets.\n\nSo, the factory produces a total of 7500 widgets over a week.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If normal production is 1000 per day, and only Monday has a 50% increase, which is 1500 on Monday, and the other six days are 1000 each, then yes, 1500 + 6*1000 = 1500 + 6000 = 7500.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the weekly production as 7 days of normal production plus the extra production on Monday. So, 7 * 1000 = 7000, plus the extra 500 from Monday's increased production, which also gives 7000 + 500 = 7500.\n\nEither way, it confirms that the total weekly production is 7500 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7500} \\]"
