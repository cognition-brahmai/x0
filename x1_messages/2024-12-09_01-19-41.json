        "content": "Let's see. I have a square garden with an area of 144 square meters, and the gardener has 40 meters of fencing. I need to figure out if this is enough to enclose the entire garden.\n\nFirst, since it's a square garden, all sides are equal in length. The area of a square is calculated by side length squared, right? So, if the area is 144 square meters, I can find the side length by taking the square root of 144.\n\nLet me calculate that. The square root of 144 is 12. So, each side of the garden is 12 meters long.\n\nNow, to find out the total fencing needed to enclose the entire garden, I need to calculate the perimeter. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. So, 4 times 12 is 48 meters.\n\nThe gardener has only 40 meters of fencing material. That means 40 meters is less than the required 48 meters. So, at first glance, it seems like he doesn't have enough material.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to enclose the garden with less fencing. Maybe by placing the fence diagonally or something. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, but it's a square garden, and he wants to enclose the entire garden. I think the perimeter is the total length needed to enclose it completely. Is there a more efficient way to fence it?\n\nPerhaps if he fences only three sides, but that wouldn't enclose the entire garden. He needs to fence all four sides to enclose it fully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he can fence along the diagonals, but that wouldn't enclose the area either. I think the only way to enclose the entire garden is to fence all four sides, which requires 48 meters.\n\nBut he only has 40 meters. So, it seems like he doesn't have enough material.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check my calculations. The area is 144 square meters, and the side length is indeed 12 meters, since 12 times 12 equals 144.\n\nPerimeter is 4 times 12, which is 48 meters. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the garden isn't a perfect square, but the problem says it's a square garden.\n\nUnless... maybe the garden isn't a perfect square, and the area is 144 square meters, but the shape is slightly different. But the problem clearly states it's a square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gardener can fence around the garden in a more efficient way, like fencing along the diagonals and somehow using less material, but I don't think that would enclose the entire garden.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gardener can use existing boundaries. For example, if one side of the garden is adjacent to a wall or another fence, he might only need to fence three sides.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any existing boundaries. It just says it's a square garden and he wants to build a fence around it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he can fence in a different shape to enclose the same area with less perimeter. But a square is already relatively efficient in terms of perimeter to area compared to some other shapes, but among regular polygons, a circle would be the most efficient.\n\nBut the garden is square, so I think the perimeter has to be 48 meters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, but assuming it's correct as given, it seems like he doesn't have enough fencing material.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gardener can fence only a part of the garden and find a way to make it secure, but the question is about enclosing the entire garden.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to share fencing or something, but again, the problem doesn't indicate any of that.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the gardener has 40 meters of fencing material, but needs 48 meters to enclose the entire garden. Therefore, he cannot enclose the entire garden with the materials he has.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No, he cannot enclose the entire garden.}} \\]"
