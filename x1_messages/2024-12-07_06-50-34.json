        "content": "So there are 30 birds on a tree, and a hunter shoots and kills 5 of them. The question is, how many birds are left on the tree?\n\nAt first glance, it seems like a straightforward subtraction problem: 30 minus 5 equals 25 birds remaining. But let's think about it more carefully.\n\nWhen the hunter shoots and kills 5 birds, it's likely that the sound of the gunshot would scare the remaining birds off the tree. So, even if some birds are still alive, they might fly away due to the commotion.\n\nAlternatively, if the hunter is very precise and the gunshot doesn't scare the other birds, maybe they would stay on the tree.\n\nBut in reality, gunshots are usually loud and startling, especially for birds, so it's probable that the remaining birds would flee the area.\n\nTherefore, considering the practical aspect, it's likely that after the hunter shoots and kills 5 birds, the remaining birds would fly away, leaving no birds on the tree.\n\nSo, the answer could be zero birds left on the tree.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another perspective. Maybe the tree is in a place where birds are used to gunshots, or perhaps the hunter is skilled enough to make no noise, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is meant to be a trick question, where the answer is zero because all the remaining birds flew away due to the gunshot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply testing basic subtraction, assuming that only the killed birds fall off or are removed, and the others stay.\n\nBut considering real-world scenarios, it's more plausible that the sound of the gunshot would scare the remaining birds away.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is zero birds left on the tree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
