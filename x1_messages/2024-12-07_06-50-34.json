        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a city with a population of 500,000 people, 60% of them own a car. I need to find out how many people do not own a car. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what percentages mean. Percentages are just another way of expressing fractions, where 100% represents the whole population. So, if 60% own cars, that means 60 out of every 100 people have a car.\n\nNow, to find out how many people own cars, I can calculate 60% of 500,000. The formula for that is:\n\nNumber of car owners = (percentage owning cars / 100) * total population\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of car owners = (60 / 100) * 500,000\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n60 divided by 100 is 0.60.\n\nThen, 0.60 multiplied by 500,000 is 300,000.\n\nSo, 300,000 people own cars.\n\nBut the question asks for how many people do not own a car. So, I need to subtract the number of car owners from the total population.\n\nNumber of people without cars = total population - number of car owners\n\nNumber of people without cars = 500,000 - 300,000 = 200,000\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about it in terms of percentages right from the start. If 60% own cars, then the remaining 40% do not own cars. So, I could have calculated 40% of 500,000 directly.\n\nLet me check that:\n\nNumber of people without cars = (40 / 100) * 500,000\n\nWhich is 0.40 * 500,000 = 200,000\n\nSame answer. So, either way works.\n\nI think the important thing here is to understand what percentages represent and how to apply them to find parts of a whole. Also, it's good to verify the answer using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, the final answer is 200,000 people do not own a car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200000} \\]"
