        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains leaving from different towns at the same time and heading towards each other. Town A and Town B are 450 miles apart. The first train from Town A is going at 60 mph, and the second train from Town B is going at 90 mph. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph. This means that together, they are closing the distance between them at a rate of 150 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between the towns is 450 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 450 miles / 150 mph = 3 hours\n\nSo, it will take 3 hours for the trains to meet.\n\nNow, both trains left at 9 am. Adding 3 hours to that time:\n\n9 am + 3 hours = 12 pm\n\nTherefore, the trains will meet at 12 pm.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this to confirm? Maybe by calculating the distance each train travels in that time.\n\nLet's check:\n\nTrain from Town A:\n\nSpeed: 60 mph\n\nTime: 3 hours\n\nDistance: 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nTrain from Town B:\n\nSpeed: 90 mph\n\nTime: 3 hours\n\nDistance: 90 mph * 3 hours = 270 miles\n\nNow, adding both distances: 180 miles + 270 miles = 450 miles, which matches the total distance between the towns. So, this confirms that my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to find the time.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after 9 am when they meet.\n\nDistance covered by Train A: 60t miles\n\nDistance covered by Train B: 90t miles\n\nTotal distance: 60t + 90t = 450 miles\n\nSo, 150t = 450\n\nSolving for t: t = 450 / 150 = 3 hours\n\nAgain, this matches my previous result.\n\nI think this is solid. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed, like time zones or something, but since both trains are leaving from towns in the same time zone, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent: both speeds are in mph, and distance is in miles, so the time comes out in hours, which is consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the trains will meet at 12 pm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12:00\\ \\text{pm}} \\]"
