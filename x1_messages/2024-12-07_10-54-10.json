        "content": "So, the train is going from station A to station B at a constant speed of 60 km/h, and it takes 2 hours for that journey. Now, the question is, how long will it take for the train to travel back from station B to station A if its speed remains the same?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. The train's speed is constant at 60 km/h in both directions, and we need to find out the time it takes to go back from B to A.\n\nI know that speed is equal to distance divided by time, or v = d/t. So, if I can find the distance between A and B, I can then use that to find the time for the return journey.\n\nGiven that the train takes 2 hours to go from A to B at 60 km/h, I can calculate the distance using the formula:\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nSo, d = 60 km/h \u00d7 2 h = 120 km\n\nTherefore, the distance between station A and station B is 120 kilometers.\n\nNow, for the return journey from B to A, the train is still traveling at the same speed of 60 km/h. So, I need to find the time it takes to cover 120 km at 60 km/h.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nTime = distance / speed\n\nSo, t = 120 km / 60 km/h = 2 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take the train 2 hours to travel back from station B to station A if its speed remains unchanged.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider here? Is there any difference between the journey from A to B and B to A, apart from the direction?\n\nThe problem states that the speed remains unchanged, so I assume it's still 60 km/h. There's no mention of any change in speed or any other factors like terrain that might affect the travel time.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the time should be the same for both journeys: 2 hours each way.\n\nLet me just double-check. If the train goes from A to B in 2 hours at 60 km/h, and returns from B to A at the same speed, then the time should indeed be the same.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
