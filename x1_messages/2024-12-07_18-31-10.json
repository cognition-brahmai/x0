        "content": "Sure! I can help you create a simple command-line calculator in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations and handles user input errors gracefully. We'll cover the following steps:\n\n1. **Setting up the project**: Create a new Java project and set up the necessary files.\n2. **Designing the calculator class**: Create a class that handles the arithmetic operations.\n3. **Handling user input**: Use the Scanner class to read user input and handle potential errors.\n4. **Implementing operations**: Define methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n5. **Testing the calculator**: Run the application and test various scenarios to ensure it works correctly.\n\nLet's dive into each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Setting up the project\n\nFirst, make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can create a new Java project using your favorite IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans), or you can use a simple text editor and compile the code using the command line.\n\nFor this example, I'll assume you're using a simple text editor and the command line.\n\nCreate a new file called `Calculator.java`.\n\n### Step 2: Designing the calculator class\n\nWe'll create a class named `Calculator` that will contain methods for each arithmetic operation. We'll also have a main method to handle user input and display the results.\n\nHere's the basic structure:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Calculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Code to handle user input and perform operations\n    }\n\n    // Method to add two numbers\n    public static double add(double num1, double num2) {\n        return num1 + num2;\n    }\n\n    // Method to subtract two numbers\n    public static double subtract(double num1, double num2) {\n        return num1 - num2;\n    }\n\n    // Method to multiply two numbers\n    public static double multiply(double num1, double num2) {\n        return num1 * num2;\n    }\n\n    // Method to divide two numbers\n    public static double divide(double num1, double num2) {\n        if (num2 == 0) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Cannot divide by zero.\");\n        }\n        return num1 / num2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Handling user input\n\nWe'll use the `Scanner` class to read user input. We need to handle cases where the user enters invalid input, such as non-numeric values.\n\nIn the `main` method, we'll prompt the user to enter two numbers and the operation they want to perform.\n\nHere's how you can handle user input:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n    try {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter first number: \");\n        double num1 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter second number: \");\n        double num2 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter operation (+, -, *, /): \");\n        String operation = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        double result;\n\n        switch (operation) {\n            case \"+\":\n                result = add(num1, num2);\n                break;\n            case \"-\":\n                result = subtract(num1, num2);\n                break;\n            case \"*\":\n                result = multiply(num1, num2);\n                break;\n            case \"/\":\n                result = divide(num1, num2);\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid operation.\");\n                return;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid number format. Please enter numeric values.\");\n    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n        System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n    } finally {\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implementing operations\n\nWe've already defined the methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the `Calculator` class. The division method includes a check to prevent division by zero by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\n### Step 5: Testing the calculator\n\nCompile the `Calculator.java` file using the command:\n\n```sh\njavac Calculator.java\n```\n\nThen, run the application:\n\n```sh\njava Calculator\n```\n\nTest various scenarios:\n\n- Valid inputs for all operations.\n- Division by zero.\n- Invalid operation symbols.\n- Non-numeric inputs.\n\nMake sure the application handles these cases gracefully, providing appropriate error messages without crashing.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou've now created a simple command-line calculator in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations and handles user input errors gracefully. This is a good starting point, and you can extend it further by adding more features like handling more complex expressions, supporting more operations, or improving the user interface.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
