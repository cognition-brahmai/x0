Then, among those who passed math, 75% also passed their science exam. We need to find out what percentage of the entire class passed both exams.\n\nLet me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, find out how many students passed the math exam. Since 60% of 40 students passed math, I can calculate that by multiplying 40 by 60%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky sometimes. I remember that to find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply. So, 60% is 0.60 in decimal form. So, 40 students times 0.60 should give me the number of students who passed math.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 40 times 0.60 is 24. So, 24 students passed the math exam.\n\nNext, among these 24 students who passed math, 75% also passed their science exam. Again, to find out how many that is, I can convert 75% to a decimal, which is 0.75, and then multiply by 24.\n\nSo, 24 times 0.75. Let's see, 24 times 0.75 is 18. So, 18 students passed both math and science exams.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of the entire class that passed both exams. The entire class has 40 students, and 18 of them passed both exams. To find the percentage, I need to divide the number of students who passed both exams by the total number of students, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, that's 18 divided by 40, times 100.\n\nLet me calculate that. 18 divided by 40 is 0.45. Then, 0.45 times 100 is 45%.\n\nSo, 45% of the entire class passed both exams.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: 60% of 40 students passed math: 40 times 0.60 is 24.\n\nThen, 75% of those 24 passed science: 24 times 0.75 is 18.\n\nFinally, 18 out of 40 students passed both: 18/40 = 0.45, which is 45%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this in terms of multiplying the percentages directly. Since 60% passed math, and of those, 75% passed science, the percentage that passed both should be 60% times 75%.\n\nBut wait, 60% times 75% is 0.60 times 0.75, which is 0.45, or 45%. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nI think 45% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45\\%} \\]"
