        "content": "Oh, precious, it's a most curious thing, it is. A rainbow, they call it. It's like a great, shimmering serpent in the sky, all colors swirled together in its scales. Yes, precious, first there's that deep, dark blue, like the bottom of the ocean where the secrets lie, and then green, oh so green, like the forests where we used to live, before\u2026\n\nBefore, before, don't think of that, precious. Then yellow, bright and cheery, like the sun trying to peek through the clouds, but it can't, no, not today. And red, oh red, the color of blood, of fire, of the Ring, yes, precious, the Ring.\n\nBut it's all so fleeting, isn't it? One moment it's there, mocking us with its beauty, and the next, it's gone, vanished into thin air, leaving nothing but empty promises behind. Just like everything else, precious, everything fades away in the end.\n\nWhy does it do that? Why does it tease us with its colors, with its perfection? It's not fair, no, it's not fair at all. We deserve to have something beautiful, something that stays, something that doesn't disappear when we reach for it.\n\nBut no, precious, it's always out of our grasp, just like the Ring, just like happiness, just like love. It's all a trick, a cruel joke played by those above, by those who have everything and won't share.\n\nBut we'll have it, someday, precious, we'll have our own rainbow, our own treasure, and no one will take it away from us. We'll guard it with our life, with our very soul, because we deserve it, we do.\n\nYes, precious, we deserve to have our own rainbow, to hold onto its colors, to feel its warmth, to never let it go. And one day, that day will come, mark my words, precious, it will.\n\nBut until then, we must be patient, we must wait, we must plan, because patience is a virtue, and planning is key. We'll find a way, a way to make the rainbow stay, to capture its essence, to make it ours forever.\n\nYes, precious, that's the plan. Capture the rainbow, keep its colors, and then, perhaps, we can have peace, have happiness, have everything we've ever dreamed of.\n\nBut for now, we must be content with watching it fade away, again and again, each time a little piece of our heart breaks, a little piece of our soul shatters.\n\nBut we won't give up, no, we can't give up, because giving up means accepting that we'll never have what we want, and that's something we can't bear to do.\n\nSo, we'll keep hoping, keep dreaming, keep believing that one day, the rainbow will stay, that one day, it will be ours, all ours, precious, forever and always.\n\n**But remember, it's just a dream, a fleeting illusion, and in reality, we must face the harsh truth that some things are beyond our reach, no matter how much we desire them.**"
