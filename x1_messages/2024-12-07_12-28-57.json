        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people, and we're given some percentages about who's wearing glasses and who's wearing hats.\n\nFirst, 40% of the group is wearing glasses. Out of these people who are wearing glasses, 25% are also wearing hats. So, I need to find out what percentage of the entire group is wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nLet me denote the total number of people in the group as 100%, for simplicity. So, 40% are wearing glasses.\n\nNow, of these 40% who are wearing glasses, 25% are also wearing hats. To find out how many people that is, I need to calculate 25% of 40%.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n25% of 40% is (25/100) * 40% = 0.25 * 40% = 10%.\n\nSo, 10% of the group is wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. I have another piece of information: 30% are wearing hats. Does that affect my calculation?\n\nWell, the question is asking for the percentage of the group that is wearing both glasses and hats, and I've already found that it's 10%. But maybe I should see if this aligns with the overall percentages given.\n\nLet me consider the total percentage of people wearing hats. 30% are wearing hats, and among those wearing glasses, 25% are also wearing hats. But I think I've already correctly calculated the overlapping group.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n- Total wearing glasses: 40%\n\n- Of those, wearing both glasses and hats: 25% of 40% = 10%\n\n- So, 10% wear both glasses and hats.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of conditional probability to verify this.\n\nThe probability of wearing both glasses and hats can be found by:\n\nP(glasses and hats) = P(hats | glasses) * P(glasses)\n\nWe know P(glasses) = 40%, and P(hats | glasses) = 25%.\n\nSo, P(glasses and hats) = 25% * 40% = 10%.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach it from the perspective of those wearing hats.\n\nWe know that 30% are wearing hats. But we don't have information about what percentage of hat wearers are also wearing glasses. The information given is only about hat wearers among those who wear glasses.\n\nBut since the question only asks for the percentage of the group wearing both, and I've already calculated it as 10%, and it's consistent with the conditional probability approach, I think 10% is the correct answer.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose there are 100 people in the group.\n\n- 40 people are wearing glasses.\n\n- 30 people are wearing hats.\n\n- Among the 40 wearing glasses, 25% are also wearing hats, which is 10 people.\n\nSo, 10 people wear both glasses and hats, which is 10% of the group.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total number of people wearing hats, which is 30, and the number wearing both is 10, that would mean that about 33.3% of hat wearers are also wearing glasses. But that's not needed for this problem.\n\nThe question only asks for the percentage of the group wearing both glasses and hats, which is 10%.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10\\%} \\]"
