        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Creating a simple Go server that responds with the current system time in JSON format is straightforward. You'll need to have Go installed on your system to run this code.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Go installed. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\nOnce you have Go installed, you can create a new file, let's say `main.go`, and write the following code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\nfunc currentTimeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tcurrentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339)\n\tresponse := map[string]string{\n\t\t\"current_time\": currentTime,\n\t}\n\n\tw.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n\tjson.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/time\", currentTimeHandler)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Server is listening on port 8080...\")\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n\n1. **Imports necessary packages**: `encoding/json` for JSON encoding, `net/http` for setting up the server, and `time` for getting the current time.\n\n2. **Defines a handler function** `currentTimeHandler` that will handle requests to the `/time` endpoint. This function gets the current time, formats it according to RFC3339 (a standard for date and time), creates a map with this time, sets the response content type to JSON, and encodes the map to JSON.\n\n3. **Sets up the HTTP server** to handle requests to `/time` with the `currentTimeHandler` and starts the server on port 8080.\n\nTo run this server, open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `main.go`, and type:\n\n```sh\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nOnce the server is running, you can test it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/time` in your web browser or using a tool like `curl`:\n\n```sh\ncurl http://localhost:8080/time\n```\n\nYou should see a JSON response like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_time\": \"2023-04-01T12:34:56Z\"\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates that your server is working correctly and is responding with the current system time in JSON format.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
