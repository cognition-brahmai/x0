        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 50 red balls and 50 blue balls in a bag. I need to figure out the minimum number of balls I must take out without looking to guarantee that I have at least 10 balls of the same color. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to guarantee that I have at least 10 balls of the same color. That means, no matter how the balls are distributed in the bag, if I take out a certain number of balls, I am assured that among them, there are at least 10 balls that are either all red or all blue.\n\nI think the worst-case scenario approach would be useful here. The worst-case scenario is that I pick balls in such a way that I delay having 10 balls of the same color as much as possible. So, I would try to balance the number of red and blue balls I pick until it's no longer possible to avoid having 10 of one color.\n\nLet's consider that I can pick up to 9 red balls and 9 blue balls without having 10 of the same color. That would be 9 red + 9 blue = 18 balls, and still, I don't have 10 of any one color. But if I pick one more ball, the 19th ball, it has to be either red or blue. If it's red, then I have 10 red balls, and if it's blue, I have 10 blue balls. So, in this case, picking 19 balls guarantees that I have at least 10 of one color.\n\nWait a minute, but there are 50 balls of each color. Does that change anything? Well, since there are enough balls of each color, the worst-case scenario still holds: I can pick 9 red and 9 blue balls without reaching 10 of the same color. The next ball I pick will necessarily make it 10 of one color.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Suppose I pick 9 red and 9 blue balls. That's 18 balls in total. The next ball I pick is either red or blue. If it's red, I have 10 red balls, and if it's blue, I have 10 blue balls. So, in either case, I have at least 10 balls of the same color.\n\nIs there a possibility that I could pick fewer than 19 balls and still guarantee having 10 of the same color? Let's see. If I pick 18 balls, it's possible to have 9 red and 9 blue, which doesn't satisfy the condition of having at least 10 of one color. Therefore, 18 balls are not enough to guarantee it.\n\nWhat about picking 19 balls? As I thought earlier, if I pick 19 balls, and assuming the worst-case scenario where I have 9 red and 9 blue, the 19th ball must be either red or blue, making it 10 of that color. So, 19 balls are sufficient.\n\nBut is there a way to have fewer than 19 balls and still guarantee having 10 of the same color? I don't think so, because with 18 balls, it's possible to have 9 and 9, which doesn't meet the condition.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it differently. Let's consider the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole has more than one pigeon. In this context, the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors (red and blue), and the \"pigeons\" are the balls I pick.\n\nSo, if I pick n balls, and there are 2 colors, then by the pigeonhole principle, the number of balls in at least one color is at least ceil(n/2). So, ceil(n/2) >= 10 would ensure that I have at least 10 balls of one color.\n\nSolving ceil(n/2) >= 10, what's the smallest n that satisfies this?\n\nWell, ceil(n/2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n/2. So, if n is even, ceil(n/2) = n/2. If n is odd, ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo, let's consider n even first. If n is even, ceil(n/2) = n/2. We want n/2 >= 10, so n >= 20.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 19. So, maybe n needs to be odd for ceil(n/2) >=10 with n as small as possible.\n\nIf n is odd, ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2. So, (n+1)/2 >=10 => n+1 >=20 => n >=19.\n\nSo, the smallest n is 19, which aligns with my earlier thought.\n\nBut according to the pigeonhole principle, n needs to be at least 19 to ensure that ceil(n/2) >=10.\n\nWait, but when n=19, ceil(19/2)=10, which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo, yes, 19 is the minimum number of balls to pick to guarantee at least 10 of the same color.\n\nBut let me consider if there's a different way to look at it. Suppose I want to guarantee that I have at least 10 red balls or at least 10 blue balls.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, I pick as many balls as possible without reaching 10 of one color. That would be picking 9 red and 9 blue balls, totaling 18 balls.\n\nThe next ball I pick, the 19th ball, must be either red or blue. If it's red, I have 10 red balls; if it's blue, I have 10 blue balls.\n\nTherefore, 19 is the minimum number of balls I need to pick to guarantee that I have at least 10 balls of the same color.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like the total number of balls in the bag. There are 50 red and 50 blue balls, making 100 balls in total.\n\nBut since I'm dealing with the worst-case scenario, and there are enough balls of each color to reach 9 without depleting one color, the result should hold.\n\nWait, what if there were fewer balls of one color? For example, if there were only 9 balls of one color and 91 of the other, then picking 19 balls could still leave a possibility of picking 9 of each, but in this case, there are 50 of each, so it's not an issue.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 19 balls.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Suppose I pick balls one by one, and I keep track of the number of red and blue balls I have.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, I pick 9 red and 9 blue balls in any order, totaling 18 balls.\n\nThe next ball I pick, the 19th ball, must be either red or blue, making it 10 of that color.\n\nTherefore, 19 is the minimum number required to guarantee at least 10 balls of the same color.\n\nI think this is solid reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
