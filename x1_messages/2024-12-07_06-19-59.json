        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are five houses in a row, each a different color: green, white, blue, red, and yellow. There are specific relationships between their positions.\n\nFirst, the green house is immediately to the left of the white house. So, green and white must be next to each other, with green on the left.\n\nSecond, the blue house is somewhere to the right of the red house. So, red is to the left of blue, but not necessarily adjacent.\n\nThird, the yellow house is between the green and blue houses. So, yellow is next to both green and blue.\n\nLet me try to arrange them step by step.\n\nStarting with the green and white houses since they are adjacent with green to the left. So, possible positions:\n\n- Green, white, _, _, _\n\n- _, green, white, _, _\n\n- _, _, green, white, _\n\n- _, _, _, green, white\n\nNow, yellow is between green and blue. So, yellow must be next to both green and blue.\n\nLet me consider the first possibility: Green, white, _, _, _\n\nIf green is first, white is second, then yellow must be next to green, so it should be third, and blue would be fourth.\n\nSo, Green, white, yellow, blue, _\n\nBut then, blue is to the right of red, so red must be before blue. Possible positions for red: first, second, or third.\n\nBut green is first, white is second, yellow is third, so red must be fourth, but blue is already fourth. Wait, but blue is fourth, and red can't be in fourth since it's blue. So, red must be third, but yellow is third. That's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, red could be second, but white is second. Another conflict. Or red could be first, but green is first. Another conflict.\n\nSo, this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nNext possibility: _, green, white, _, _\n\nIf green is second, white is third, then yellow must be next to green, so it could be first or fourth.\n\nIf yellow is first, then blue would be second, but green is second. Conflict.\n\nIf yellow is fourth, then blue would be fifth.\n\nSo, arrangement: _, green, white, yellow, blue\n\nNow, red must be to the left of blue, and the only position left is first.\n\nSo, red, green, white, yellow, blue\n\nLet's check if this satisfies all conditions.\n\n1. Green is immediately to the left of white: green second, white third. Correct.\n\n2. Blue is to the right of red: blue fifth, red first. Correct.\n\n3. Yellow is between green and blue: yellow fourth, between white third and blue fifth. Wait, but yellow should be between green and blue, meaning adjacent to both.\n\nIn this arrangement, yellow is fourth, adjacent to white third and blue fifth, but green is second. So, yellow is not adjacent to green. Therefore, this doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nNext possibility: _, _, green, white, _\n\nGreen is third, white is fourth, yellow must be second or fifth.\n\nIf yellow is second, then blue is third, but green is third. Conflict.\n\nIf yellow is fifth, then blue is sixth, but there are only five houses. Can't be.\n\nSo, this doesn't work.\n\nNext possibility: _, _, _, green, white\n\nGreen is fourth, white is fifth, yellow must be third or fifth.\n\nIf yellow is third, then blue is fourth, but green is fourth. Conflict.\n\nIf yellow is fifth, then blue is sixth. Can't be.\n\nSo, this doesn't work either.\n\nAlright, none of the above arrangements work. Let's try a different approach.\n\nSince yellow is between green and blue, the sequence must include green, yellow, blue in that order, with yellow adjacent to both.\n\nSo, possible sequences:\n\n- Green, yellow, blue\n\n- Blue, yellow, green\n\nBut, green is to the left of white, and blue is to the right of red.\n\nWait, green is immediately to the left of white, so green and white must be together with green on the left.\n\nAlso, blue is to the right of red, but not necessarily adjacent.\n\nSo, let's consider the sequence green, yellow, blue.\n\nIf green is to the left of white, and green is in the sequence before yellow and blue, then white must be next to green.\n\nSo, green, white, yellow, blue.\n\nBut then, red must be to the left of blue, so red could be first or second.\n\nBut green is first, white is second, yellow is third, blue is fourth, so red must be first.\n\nThus, red, green, white, yellow, blue.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that yellow is not between green and blue in this arrangement.\n\nWait, in this arrangement, green is second, white is third, yellow is fourth, blue is fifth.\n\nSo, yellow is between white and blue, not between green and blue.\n\nTherefore, this doesn't satisfy the condition that yellow is between green and blue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is blue, yellow, green.\n\nBut green is to the left of white, so green must be before white.\n\nAlso, blue is to the right of red.\n\nIf blue is first, yellow second, green third, then white must be fourth.\n\nSo, blue, yellow, green, white, red.\n\nBut here, blue is first, red is fifth, so blue is to the right of red. That works.\n\nAlso, green is third, white is fourth, so green is immediately to the left of white. That works.\n\nYellow is second, between blue and green. So, yellow is adjacent to both blue and green. That works.\n\nSo, the order is blue, yellow, green, white, red.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that blue is to the right of red, and in this arrangement, blue is first and red is fifth, which satisfies that condition.\n\nAlso, green is immediately to the left of white: green third, white fourth. Correct.\n\nYellow is between green and blue: yellow second, between blue first and green third. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the order from left to right is: blue, yellow, green, white, red.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nConditions:\n\n1. Green is immediately to the left of white: green and white are third and fourth, respectively. Correct.\n\n2. Blue is to the right of red: blue is first, red is fifth. Correct.\n\n3. Yellow is between green and blue: yellow is second, between blue first and green third. Yes, that works.\n\nSeems like this is the correct order.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{blue, yellow, green, white, red}} \\]"
