        "content": "So, there are five friends who initially decide to split a $100 gift equally. That means each friend was going to pay $100 divided by 5, which is $20 each. But then one friend decides not to contribute. So now, there are only four friends left to pay for the same $100 gift.\n\nTo find out how much each of the remaining four friends has to pay, we need to divide the total cost by the number of friends who are still paying. So, that's $100 divided by 4.\n\nLet me do the calculation: $100 \u00f7 4 = $25.\n\nSo, each of the remaining four friends has to pay $25 now.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check that. Initially, each friend was paying $20, and now with one friend dropping out, the remaining four have to pay $25 each. That means the total amount being paid is still $100, which makes sense because that's the cost of the gift.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that one friend backed out, so the total amount they need to cover remains $100, but now it's divided among four people instead of five. So, yes, $25 per person.\n\nI think that's correct. Unless there's something else to consider here, like maybe the friend who backed out had already paid something, but in this scenario, it seems like they haven't paid anything yet.\n\nSo, the answer should be $25 per friend.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
