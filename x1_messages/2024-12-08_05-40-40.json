        "content": "Let's see. So, Alice, Bob, and Carol are sharing the cost of a $60 gift, and there are some specific rules about how much each one contributes. Alice contributes twice as much as Bob, and Carol contributes half as much as Alice. I need to figure out how much each person pays.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to each person's contribution to make it easier to work with. Let's say Bob's contribution is B dollars. Since Alice contributes twice as much as Bob, Alice's contribution would be 2B dollars. And Carol contributes half as much as Alice, so Carol's contribution would be (1/2)*Alice's contribution, which is (1/2)*2B = B dollars.\n\nNow, I can write an equation that adds up all their contributions and sets it equal to the total cost of the gift, which is $60.\n\nSo, Alice + Bob + Carol = $60\n\nThat is, 2B + B + B = 60\n\nCombining like terms, that's 4B = 60\n\nNow, I can solve for B by dividing both sides by 4.\n\nB = 60 / 4\n\nB = 15\n\nSo, Bob contributes $15.\n\nSince Alice contributes twice as much as Bob, Alice contributes 2 * 15 = $30.\n\nAnd Carol contributes half as much as Alice, which is (1/2)*30 = $15.\n\nWait a minute, that means Bob and Carol both contribute $15, and Alice contributes $30, which adds up to $60. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check if I set up the relationships correctly.\n\nAlice contributes twice as much as Bob: Alice = 2 * Bob. That's correct.\n\nCarol contributes half as much as Alice: Carol = (1/2) * Alice. That's also correct.\n\nAnd the total is Alice + Bob + Carol = 60. That's right.\n\nSo, the final amounts are:\n\nAlice: $30\n\nBob: $15\n\nCarol: $15\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice: } \\$30, \\text{ Bob: } \\$15, \\text{ Carol: } \\$15} \\]"
