        "content": "Let's see. The factory starts by producing 500 units per day. They plan to increase production by 5% every week. I need to find out how many units they will produce on the 4th week.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means to increase production by 5% each week. Since the increase is weekly, I need to apply the 5% increase to the production amount at the end of each week.\n\nWait, but the factory produces units daily. Does the increase apply to the daily production rate, or is there a different interpretation?\n\nAssuming the increase is applied to the daily production rate, meaning that each week, the daily production is increased by 5% from the previous week's daily rate.\n\nSo, let's define some variables:\n\n- Let P0 be the initial daily production rate: P0 = 500 units/day\n\n- Let r be the weekly growth rate: r = 5% = 0.05\n\n- We need to find the daily production rate at the end of the 4th week, which would be P4.\n\nSince the production increases by 5% each week, the production rate at the end of each week can be calculated using the formula for compound growth:\n\nPn = P0 * (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- Pn is the production rate at the end of week n\n\n- P0 is the initial production rate\n\n- r is the weekly growth rate\n\n- n is the number of weeks\n\nSo, for the 4th week:\n\nP4 = 500 * (1 + 0.05)^4\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.05):\n\n1 + 0.05 = 1.05\n\nThen raise it to the power of 4:\n\n1.05^4\n\nI know that 1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\nSo, 1.05^4 = (1.05^2)^2 = 1.1025^2\n\nCalculating 1.1025^2:\n\n1.1025 * 1.1025\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n1.1025 * 1 = 1.1025\n\n1.1025 * 0.1 = 0.11025\n\n1.1025 * 0.0025 = 0.00275625\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1.1025 + 0.11025 + 0.00275625 = 1.21550625\n\nSo, 1.05^4 = 1.21550625\n\nNow, multiply this by the initial production rate:\n\nP4 = 500 * 1.21550625 = 607.753125 units/day\n\nSince production is usually in whole units, we might round this to 608 units/day.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the number of units produced in the 4th week, not the daily production rate at the end of the 4th week. Maybe I need to calculate the total production during the 4th week.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf the production increases by 5% each week, then each week has a different daily production rate.\n\nSo, for week 1: P1 = P0 * (1 + r)^0 = 500 * 1 = 500 units/day\n\nWeek 2: P2 = P0 * (1 + r)^1 = 500 * 1.05 = 525 units/day\n\nWeek 3: P3 = P0 * (1 + r)^2 = 500 * 1.1025 = 551.25 units/day\n\nWeek 4: P4 = P0 * (1 + r)^3 = 500 * 1.157625 = 578.8125 units/day\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nIn the formula Pn = P0 * (1 + r)^n, n is the number of weeks that have passed since the initial production rate.\n\nSo, at the end of week 1, n=1: P1 = 500 * 1.05 = 525 units/day\n\nAt the end of week 2, n=2: P2 = 500 * 1.1025 = 551.25 units/day\n\nAt the end of week 3, n=3: P3 = 500 * 1.157625 = 578.8125 units/day\n\nAt the end of week 4, n=4: P4 = 500 * 1.21550625 = 607.753125 units/day\n\nBut the question is about the 4th week, which would be from day 21 to day 28, assuming a 7-day week.\n\nHowever, if the increase is applied at the end of each week, then the production rate for week 4 would be P4, which is 607.753125 units/day.\n\nBut to find the total production in the 4th week, I need to multiply the daily production rate by the number of days in the week.\n\nAssuming a 7-day week:\n\nTotal production in week 4 = P4 * 7 = 607.753125 * 7\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n607.753125 * 7 =\n\n600 * 7 = 4200\n\n7.753125 * 7 =\n\n7 * 7 = 49\n\n0.753125 * 7 = 5.271875\n\nSo, 4200 + 49 + 5.271875 = 4254.271875\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, approximately 4254 units.\n\nBut earlier, I thought P4 was the production rate at the end of the 4th week, but according to the formula Pn = P0 * (1 + r)^n, P4 would be the production rate at the end of the 4th week, which would be the production rate for the 5th week.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the timing of the increases.\n\nIf the factory increases production by 5% at the end of each week, then the new production rate takes effect from the beginning of the next week.\n\nSo, initial production: 500 units/day for week 1\n\nAt the end of week 1, increase by 5%, so new rate for week 2: 500 * 1.05 = 525 units/day\n\nAt the end of week 2, increase by another 5%, so new rate for week 3: 525 * 1.05 = 551.25 units/day\n\nAt the end of week 3, increase by another 5%, so new rate for week 4: 551.25 * 1.05 = 578.8125 units/day\n\nTherefore, during the 4th week, the production rate is 578.8125 units/day.\n\nTotal production in week 4: 578.8125 * 7 = 4051.6875 units\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number: 4052 units\n\nBut earlier, I calculated P4 as 607.753125 units/day, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf the initial production is P0 = 500 units/day, and it increases by 5% at the end of each week, then:\n\n- Week 1: P0 = 500 units/day for all 7 days\n\n- Week 2: P1 = P0 * 1.05 = 525 units/day for all 7 days\n\n- Week 3: P2 = P1 * 1.05 = 525 * 1.05 = 551.25 units/day for all 7 days\n\n- Week 4: P3 = P2 * 1.05 = 551.25 * 1.05 = 578.8125 units/day for all 7 days\n\nTherefore, total production in week 4 is P3 * 7 = 578.8125 * 7 = 4051.6875 units, which rounds to 4052 units.\n\nBut earlier, using the formula Pn = P0 * (1 + r)^n, for n=4, I got P4 = 607.753125 units/day, which would be the production rate at the start of week 5, not week 4.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion arises from the interpretation of n in the formula.\n\nIf n is the number of weeks that have passed, then Pn is the production rate at the start of week n+1.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- P0: start of week 1\n\n- P1: start of week 2\n\n- P2: start of week 3\n\n- P3: start of week 4\n\n- P4: start of week 5\n\nSo, for week 4, the production rate would be P3.\n\nTherefore, P3 = P0 * (1 + r)^3 = 500 * 1.05^3\n\nCalculating 1.05^3:\n\n1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\n1.05^3 = 1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625\n\nSo, P3 = 500 * 1.157625 = 578.8125 units/day\n\nTotal production in week 4: 578.8125 * 7 = 4051.6875 units, or approximately 4052 units.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory will produce approximately 4052 units in the 4th week.\n\nBut to make sure, let's verify the calculations step by step.\n\nStarting with P0 = 500 units/day\n\nAfter week 1, increase by 5%: P1 = 500 * 1.05 = 525 units/day\n\nAfter week 2, increase by another 5%: P2 = 525 * 1.05 = 551.25 units/day\n\nAfter week 3, increase by another 5%: P3 = 551.25 * 1.05 = 578.8125 units/day\n\nTherefore, in week 4, the daily production rate is 578.8125 units/day.\n\nTotal for week 4: 578.8125 * 7 = 4051.6875 units\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number: 4052 units\n\nAlternatively, using the formula Pn = P0 * (1 + r)^n, with n=3 for the start of week 4:\n\nP3 = 500 * 1.05^3 = 500 * 1.157625 = 578.8125 units/day\n\nAgain, total for week 4: 578.8125 * 7 = 4051.6875 units \u2248 4052 units\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce approximately 4052 units in the 4th week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4052} \\]"
