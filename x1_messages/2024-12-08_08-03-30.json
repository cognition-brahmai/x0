Drinking unicorn blood will grant the drinker life, but it comes with a curse, as the drinker's soul is condemned for the rest of eternity. This is because unicorns are pure and magical creatures, and taking their blood is considered a grave offense. This is mentioned in \"Philosopher's Stone\" when Harry and Ron encounter a dying unicorn in the Forbidden Forest, and Professor McGonagall explains the consequences of drinking unicorn blood."
