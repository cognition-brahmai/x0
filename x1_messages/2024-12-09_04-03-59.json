        "content": "So I have this problem here: I need to distribute 10 identical candies among 4 children, and each child has to get at least one candy. I'm trying to figure out how many different ways I can do this.\n\nFirst, since the candies are identical, it's not about which specific candies each child gets, but rather how many candies each one receives. So, it's more about dividing the number 10 into 4 parts, where each part is at least 1.\n\nI remember that in combinatorics, there's a formula for distributing identical items into distinct groups, especially when there are constraints like each group getting at least one item.\n\nLet me think about the formula for distributing n identical items into k distinct groups, with each group getting at least one item. I think it's something like \"n-1 choose k-1.\" Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me double-check that. If I have n identical items and I want to distribute them into k distinct groups with no restrictions, the number of ways is \"n+k-1 choose k-1.\" That makes sense because it's like placing k-1 dividers among n items.\n\nBut in this case, since each child must get at least one candy, I need to adjust for that constraint.\n\nOne way to handle this is to first give each child one candy. That way, I've satisfied the \"at least one\" requirement for each child. So, I've given out 4 candies (one to each child), and I have 6 candies left to distribute without any restrictions.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to distributing 6 identical candies among 4 children, with no restrictions on how many each child gets, including the possibility of getting zero.\n\nSo, using the formula I mentioned earlier, the number of ways to distribute 6 identical candies into 4 distinct groups is \"6+4-1 choose 4-1,\" which is \"9 choose 3.\"\n\nLet me calculate that. 9 choose 3 is equal to 84.\n\nSo, there are 84 different ways to distribute the 10 identical candies among 4 children, with each child getting at least one candy.\n\nWait a minute, let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother method I've learned is to use the stars and bars theorem. The stars represent the identical candies, and the bars represent the dividers between different children.\n\nSo, for 10 candies and 4 children, I would have 10 stars and 3 bars (since 4 groups need 3 dividers).\n\nBut again, since each child must get at least one candy, I can first give one candy to each child, and then distribute the remaining candies freely.\n\nSo, after giving one candy to each, I have 6 candies left to distribute with no restrictions.\n\nTherefore, I have 6 stars and 3 bars, and the total number of arrangements is \"6 + 3 choose 3,\" which is again \"9 choose 3,\" equal to 84.\n\nHmm, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe I can think about the possible distributions directly.\n\nLet's denote the number of candies each child gets as c1, c2, c3, and c4, where each ci is at least 1, and c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 = 10.\n\nI can make a substitution to simplify this. Let di = ci - 1, where di >= 0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n(d1 + 1) + (d2 + 1) + (d3 + 1) + (d4 + 1) = 10,\n\nWhich simplifies to d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 = 6,\n\nWhere di are non-negative integers.\n\nNow, this is a standard stars and bars problem without any restrictions.\n\nThe number of solutions is \"6 + 4 - 1 choose 4 - 1,\" which is again \"9 choose 3,\" equal to 84.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 84 as the answer.\n\nLet me try to think if there's any other approach that might give a different answer, just to be sure.\n\nSuppose I list out all possible distributions manually. But with 10 candies and 4 children, that could take a while, and it's prone to error. However, for small numbers, it's a good way to verify.\n\nFor example, if I have 4 children and 3 candies, with each getting at least one candy, the only distribution is 1,1,1,0, but since each must get at least one, it's not possible in this case. Wait, no, in that case, it's not possible because 4 children need at least 4 candies, but we only have 3.\n\nIn our problem, we have 10 candies and 4 children, each getting at least one, so it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of generating functions. The generating function for each child is x + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^10, since each child gets at least one candy.\n\nWait, actually, since the candies are identical and unlimited in number for distribution, the generating function for each child is x + x^2 + x^3 + ..., which is x/(1-x).\n\nSo, for 4 children, the generating function is (x + x^2 + x^3 + ...)^4 = x^4 / (1 - x)^4.\n\nNow, I need the coefficient of x^10 in this generating function, which is the same as the coefficient of x^6 in 1 / (1 - x)^4.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the coefficient of x^k in 1 / (1 - x)^m is \"k + m - 1 choose m - 1.\"\n\nSo, for m = 4 and k = 6, it's \"6 + 4 - 1 choose 4 - 1,\" which is \"9 choose 3,\" equal to 84.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently through different methods: the stars and bars theorem, substitution, and generating functions. All these methods lead to the same conclusion that there are 84 ways to distribute 10 identical candies among 4 children with each child getting at least one candy.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something? Maybe overcounting or undercounting certain distributions.\n\nLet me consider a smaller case to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose I have 3 candies and 2 children, each getting at least one candy.\n\nUsing the same method:\n\nFirst, give one candy to each child, so I have 1 candy left to distribute freely.\n\nUsing stars and bars, it's \"1 + 2 - 1 choose 2 - 1,\" which is \"2 choose 1,\" equal to 2.\n\nManually, the possible distributions are:\n\n- Child 1 gets 2 candies, child 2 gets 1.\n\n- Child 1 gets 1 candy, child 2 gets 2.\n\nThat's indeed 2 ways, matching my calculation.\n\nAnother small case: 4 candies, 3 children, each getting at least one.\n\nFirst, give one to each, leaving 1 candy to distribute freely.\n\nUsing stars and bars: \"1 + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1,\" which is \"3 choose 2,\" equal to 3.\n\nManual enumeration:\n\n- One child gets 2, others get 1 each.\n\n- There are 3 children, so 3 different ways.\n\nAgain, matches the calculation.\n\nSo, the method seems solid.\n\nTherefore, for the original problem, the number of ways is 84.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]"
