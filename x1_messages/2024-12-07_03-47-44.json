        "content": "Sure! Implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Java for a weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix is a great way to understand both the algorithm and graph theory. I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Dijkstra's Algorithm\n\nDijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a set to keep track of vertices whose shortest paths from the source are already determined.\n   - Initialize the distance of the source vertex to 0 and the distances of all other vertices to infinity.\n\n2. **Main Loop**:\n   - Select the vertex with the minimum distance that has not been processed yet.\n   - Update the distances of its adjacent vertices.\n   - Mark the selected vertex as processed.\n\n3. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat the above step until all vertices are processed.\n\n### Step 2: Representing the Graph\n\nWe'll represent the graph using an adjacency matrix. In Java, this can be a 2D array where `graph[i][j]` represents the weight of the edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`. If there is no edge, we'll use `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to represent infinity.\n\n### Step 3: Implementing the Algorithm\n\nWe'll need to keep track of the distances and which vertices have been processed. For simplicity, we'll use a boolean array to mark processed vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Writing the Code\n\nLet's write the Java code step by step.\n\n#### 4.1: Import necessary packages\n\n```java\npublic class DijkstraAlgorithm {\n    // Number of vertices in the graph\n    private int numVertices;\n    // 2D array to represent the adjacency matrix\n    private int[][] graph;\n}\n```\n\n#### 4.2: Constructor to initialize the graph\n\n```java\npublic DijkstraAlgorithm(int vertices) {\n    this.numVertices = vertices;\n    this.graph = new int[vertices][vertices];\n}\n```\n\n#### 4.3: Method to set the adjacency matrix\n\n```java\npublic void setGraph(int[][] graph) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < numVertices; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < numVertices; j++) {\n            this.graph[i][j] = graph[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4.4: Method to get the minimum distance vertex\n\n```java\nprivate int getMinDistanceVertex(boolean[] processed, int[] distances) {\n    int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n    int minIndex = -1;\n    for (int v = 0; v < numVertices; v++) {\n        if (!processed[v] && distances[v] <= minDistance) {\n            minDistance = distances[v];\n            minIndex = v;\n        }\n    }\n    return minIndex;\n}\n```\n\n#### 4.5: Dijkstra's algorithm implementation\n\n```java\npublic void dijkstra(int src) {\n    // Array to store shortest distances from source\n    int[] distances = new int[numVertices];\n    // Array to track processed vertices\n    boolean[] processed = new boolean[numVertices];\n    \n    // Initialize all distances as infinite and processed as false\n    for (int i = 0; i < numVertices; i++) {\n        distances[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n        processed[i] = false;\n    }\n    \n    // Distance of source vertex from itself is 0\n    distances[src] = 0;\n    \n    for (int count = 0; count < numVertices; count++) {\n        // Pick the minimum distance vertex from the set of vertices not yet processed\n        int u = getMinDistanceVertex(processed, distances);\n        \n        // Mark the picked vertex as processed\n        processed[u] = true;\n        \n        // Update distances of adjacent vertices of the picked vertex\n        for (int v = 0; v < numVertices; v++) {\n            // Update distances[v] only if there is an edge from u to v, \n            // vertex v is not processed, and the distance is smaller\n            if (!processed[v] && graph[u][v] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && \n                distances[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && \n                distances[u] + graph[u][v] < distances[v]) {\n                distances[v] = distances[u] + graph[u][v];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Print the constructed distance array\n    printSolution(distances);\n}\n```\n\n#### 4.6: Method to print the solution\n\n```java\nprivate void printSolution(int[] distances) {\n    System.out.println(\"Vertex\\tDistance from Source\");\n    for (int i = 0; i < numVertices; i++) {\n        System.out.println(i + \"\\t\" + distances[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4.7: Main method to test the algorithm\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    /* Let's create the following graph\n            0--4--1\n            |     |\n        1   |     |   1\n            |     |\n            2--1--3\n    */\n    int[][] graph = new int[][]{\n        {0, 4, 1, Integer.MAX_VALUE},\n        {4, 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 1},\n        {1, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0, 1},\n        {Integer.MAX_VALUE, 1, 1, 0}\n    };\n    \n    DijkstraAlgorithm dijkstra = new DijkstraAlgorithm(4);\n    dijkstra.setGraph(graph);\n    dijkstra.dijkstra(0);\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We set all distances to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` except the source, which is set to 0.\n   \n2. **Selecting the minimum distance vertex**:\n   - We repeatedly select the vertex with the smallest distance that hasn't been processed yet.\n   \n3. **Updating distances**:\n   - For each adjacent vertex of the selected vertex, we check if the distance can be shortened through the current vertex.\n   \n4. **Marking as processed**:\n   - Once a vertex is processed, we don't consider it again.\n\nThis implementation ensures that we find the shortest paths from the source to all other vertices in the graph efficiently."
