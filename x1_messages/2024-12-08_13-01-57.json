        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple Java program that acts as a calculator. It should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers that the user inputs. I need to make sure that the program is user-friendly and handles any potential errors, like division by zero.\n\nFirst, I'll start by setting up the basic structure of a Java class. I'll call it \"SimpleCalculator\". Since I need to interact with the user, I'll use the Scanner class to read inputs from the console.\n\nI should plan out the steps:\n\n1. Display a menu to the user with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n2. Ask the user to select an operation.\n\n3. Ask the user to input two numbers.\n\n4. Perform the selected operation on those two numbers.\n\n5. Display the result.\n\nI also need to handle cases where the user might enter invalid inputs, like non-numeric values or trying to divide by zero.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the menu. I can use a series of print statements to display the options and then use Scanner to read the user's choice.\n\nFor example:\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Select an operation:\");\n\nSystem.out.println(\"1. Addition\");\n\nSystem.out.println(\"2. Subtraction\");\n\nSystem.out.println(\"3. Multiplication\");\n\nSystem.out.println(\"4. Division\");\n\nThen, I'll read the user's choice as an integer.\n\nNext, I need to read two numbers from the user. I'll prompt them to enter the first and second numbers.\n\nAfter that, I'll use a switch statement based on the user's choice to perform the appropriate operation.\n\nFor addition, I'll add the two numbers.\n\nFor subtraction, I'll subtract the second number from the first.\n\nFor multiplication, I'll multiply the two numbers.\n\nFor division, I'll divide the first number by the second and handle the case where the second number is zero.\n\nI should also make sure that the user cannot proceed if they enter non-numeric values for the numbers.\n\nMaybe I should use try-catch blocks to handle any InputMismatchExceptions that might occur if the user enters something other than numbers.\n\nAlso, for division, I need to check if the second number is zero and display an error message if it is.\n\nLet me sketch out the code structure:\n\n- Import Scanner class.\n\n- Create a public class SimpleCalculator.\n\n- Inside the class, have the main method.\n\n- Create a Scanner object.\n\n- Display the menu and read the user's choice.\n\n- Read the two numbers.\n\n- Use a switch statement to perform the operation based on the choice.\n\n- Handle division by zero.\n\n- Display the result.\n\nI should also think about looping the program so that the user can perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. Maybe add an option to exit.\n\nAlright, I'll add a loop that continues until the user decides to exit.\n\nI can add an extra option in the menu like \"5. Exit\" and break the loop when the user chooses to exit.\n\nThat sounds good.\n\nLet me start writing the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple calculator in Java that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can use the following code. This program uses basic input/output operations and error handling to ensure it functions correctly.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        boolean exit = false;\n\n        while (!exit) {\n            // Display menu\n            System.out.println(\"\\nSelect an operation:\");\n            System.out.println(\"1. Addition\");\n            System.out.println(\"2. Subtraction\");\n            System.out.println(\"3. Multiplication\");\n            System.out.println(\"4. Division\");\n            System.out.println(\"5. Exit\");\n\n            // Read choice\n            int choice = 0;\n            try {\n                choice = scanner.nextInt();\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\");\n                scanner.nextLine(); // Clear the invalid input\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            // Exit the loop if choice is 5\n            if (choice == 5) {\n                exit = true;\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            // Read two numbers\n            double num1 = 0, num2 = 0;\n            try {\n                System.out.println(\"Enter the first number:\");\n                num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n                System.out.println(\"Enter the second number:\");\n                num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\");\n                scanner.nextLine(); // Clear the invalid input\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            // Perform operation\n            double result = 0;\n            switch (choice) {\n                case 1:\n                    result = num1 + num2;\n                    break;\n                case 2:\n                    result = num1 - num2;\n                    break;\n                case 3:\n                    result = num1 * num2;\n                    break;\n                case 4:\n                    if (num2 != 0) {\n                        result = num1 / num2;\n                    } else {\n                        System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                        continue;\n                    }\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid operation.\");\n                    continue;\n            }\n\n            // Display result\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        }\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Menu Display**: The program displays a menu with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exit.\n2. **Input Handling**: It reads the user's choice and two numbers using `Scanner`. It handles invalid inputs using try-catch blocks.\n3. **Operation Performance**: Based on the user's choice, it performs the corresponding operation. For division, it checks if the denominator is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n4. **Loop and Exit**: The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple calculations. The user can choose to exit the program by selecting the exit option.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program is user-friendly and robust against common input errors."
