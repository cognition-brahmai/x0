        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The original garden is 20 meters long and 15 meters wide. The task is to increase its area by 50% while keeping it a rectangle. I need to find out what the new dimensions should be.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the original area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, right? So, original area = length \u00d7 width = 20 m \u00d7 15 m = 300 square meters.\n\nNow, I need to increase this area by 50%. So, the increase in area is 50% of 300 square meters. Let me calculate that: 50% of 300 is 0.5 \u00d7 300 = 150 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the new area should be the original area plus the increase: 300 m\u00b2 + 150 m\u00b2 = 450 square meters.\n\nOkay, so the new area is 450 square meters, and I need to keep the shape as a rectangle. But there are lots of possible rectangles with different lengths and widths that can give an area of 450 square meters. How do I decide on the new dimensions?\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's something in the problem that specifies how the dimensions should change. Let's read the problem again: \"increase the area of the garden by 50% while keeping its shape as a rectangle.\"\n\nHmm, \"keeping its shape\" might mean keeping the same ratio of length to width. So, if the original rectangle has a length-to-width ratio of 20:15, which simplifies to 4:3, maybe the new rectangle should also have a 4:3 ratio.\n\nLet me check that. Original length is 20 m, width is 15 m. So, the ratio is 20/15 = 4/3.\n\nIf I keep the same ratio for the new dimensions, let's denote the new length as L and the new width as W, with L/W = 4/3.\n\nSo, L = (4/3)W.\n\nNow, the area of the new rectangle is L \u00d7 W = 450 m\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting L from above: (4/3)W \u00d7 W = 450.\n\nSo, (4/3)W\u00b2 = 450.\n\nNow, solve for W: W\u00b2 = 450 \u00d7 3/4 = 337.5.\n\nSo, W = sqrt(337.5) \u2248 18.37 meters.\n\nThen, L = (4/3) \u00d7 18.37 \u2248 24.49 meters.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nI recall that for similar rectangles, the ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of corresponding sides.\n\nIn this case, since we're keeping the shape the same, the new rectangle is similar to the old one, meaning the scale factor for the sides is the square root of the ratio of the areas.\n\nThe area is increasing by 50%, so the new area is 1.5 times the old area.\n\nTherefore, the scale factor for the sides should be sqrt(1.5).\n\nLet me calculate that: sqrt(1.5) \u2248 1.2247.\n\nSo, to get the new dimensions, I can multiply the original length and width by this scale factor.\n\nNew length = 20 m \u00d7 1.2247 \u2248 24.494 m.\n\nNew width = 15 m \u00d7 1.2247 \u2248 18.371 m.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the new dimensions should be approximately 24.49 meters in length and 18.37 meters in width.\n\nBut maybe I should express it more precisely. Let's see.\n\nSince the original ratio is 4:3, and we're keeping that ratio, we can express the new dimensions in terms of a variable.\n\nLet\u2019s say W = 3x, and L = 4x.\n\nThen, area = L \u00d7 W = 4x \u00d7 3x = 12x\u00b2 = 450 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 450 / 12 = 37.5.\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(37.5) \u2248 6.124 meters.\n\nThen, W = 3x \u2248 18.372 meters.\n\nL = 4x \u2248 24.494 meters.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rationalize the numbers or express them in fractional form.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom x\u00b2 = 37.5, x = sqrt(37.5) = sqrt(75/2) = sqrt(75)/sqrt(2) = (5*sqrt(3))/(sqrt(2)) = (5*sqrt(6))/2.\n\nTherefore, W = 3x = 3*(5*sqrt(6)/2) = (15*sqrt(6))/2 meters.\n\nL = 4x = 4*(5*sqrt(6)/2) = 10*sqrt(6) meters.\n\nSo, the exact dimensions are:\n\nWidth: (15*sqrt(6))/2 meters.\n\nLength: 10*sqrt(6) meters.\n\nBut maybe it's better to provide decimal approximations for practical purposes.\n\nSo, sqrt(6) \u2248 2.44949.\n\nTherefore, W \u2248 (15 \u00d7 2.44949)/2 \u2248 18.371 meters.\n\nL \u2248 10 \u00d7 2.44949 \u2248 24.495 meters.\n\nYes, that's consistent with earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that we\u2019re increasing the area by 50% but keeping the shape the same.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that both length and width are scaled by the same factor, since we\u2019re keeping the shape rectangular with the same aspect ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the scale factor as k.\n\nThen, new length = k \u00d7 original length.\n\nNew width = k \u00d7 original width.\n\nNew area = (k \u00d7 original length) \u00d7 (k \u00d7 original width) = k\u00b2 \u00d7 (original length \u00d7 original width) = k\u00b2 \u00d7 original area.\n\nWe want the new area to be 1.5 times the original area.\n\nSo, k\u00b2 \u00d7 original area = 1.5 \u00d7 original area.\n\nTherefore, k\u00b2 = 1.5.\n\nThus, k = sqrt(1.5) \u2248 1.2247.\n\nAgain, this matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions are:\n\nLength = 20 m \u00d7 1.2247 \u2248 24.494 m.\n\nWidth = 15 m \u00d7 1.2247 \u2248 18.371 m.\n\nAlternatively, to express it more precisely:\n\nLength = 20 \u00d7 sqrt(1.5) meters.\n\nWidth = 15 \u00d7 sqrt(1.5) meters.\n\nBut earlier, I expressed it in terms of sqrt(6), which might be more simplified.\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nsqrt(1.5) = sqrt(3/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(6)/2.\n\nTherefore, length = 20 \u00d7 (sqrt(6)/2) = 10 \u00d7 sqrt(6) meters.\n\nWidth = 15 \u00d7 (sqrt(6)/2) = (15 \u00d7 sqrt(6))/2 meters.\n\nThis matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, the exact dimensions are:\n\nLength: 10\u221a6 meters.\n\nWidth: (15\u221a6)/2 meters.\n\nApproximately:\n\nLength: 24.495 meters.\n\nWidth: 18.371 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let's check the area with these new dimensions.\n\nArea = L \u00d7 W = 10\u221a6 \u00d7 (15\u221a6)/2 = (10 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 6)/(2) = (900)/2 = 450 m\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's correct. And 450 m\u00b2 is indeed a 50% increase from the original 300 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, the new dimensions should be 10\u221a6 meters in length and (15\u221a6)/2 meters in width, or approximately 24.495 meters by 18.371 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe new dimensions of the garden should be \\boxed{10\\sqrt{6} \\text{ meters in length and } \\frac{15\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\text{ meters in width}}."
