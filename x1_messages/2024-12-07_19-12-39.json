There are 10 distribution centers, each serving an average of 50 stores located within a 100-mile radius. Each store receives deliveries from one distribution center using trucks with a capacity of 20 tons. Calculate the total annual fuel cost for these deliveries, assuming that each truck travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, consumes 6 miles per gallon of diesel fuel, and makes daily round trips to each store.

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It seems a bit complex at first, but if I break it down, I can manage to find the total annual fuel cost for the supermarket chain's deliveries.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup:\n\n- There are 10 distribution centers.\n\n- Each distribution center serves an average of 50 stores.\n\n- Each store is within a 100-mile radius of its distribution center.\n\n- Deliveries are made using trucks with a capacity of 20 tons.\n\n- Each truck travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.\n\n- Fuel consumption is 6 miles per gallon of diesel.\n\n- Diesel costs $3 per gallon.\n\n- Trucks make daily round trips to each store.\n\nMy goal is to calculate the total annual fuel cost for all these deliveries.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the distance each truck travels per day.\n\nSince each truck makes daily round trips to each store, and each store is within a 100-mile radius, the round trip distance to one store is 200 miles (100 miles to the store and 100 miles back).\n\nNow, each distribution center serves 50 stores, so the total daily distance for one truck is:\n\n200 miles/store * 50 stores = 10,000 miles per day.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too high. Let me double-check.\n\nIf each truck makes a round trip to each store daily, and there are 50 stores, then yes, that would be 50 round trips, each being 200 miles, totaling 10,000 miles per day.\n\nBut is that realistic? Maybe each truck serves multiple stores in a day, but doesn't necessarily make individual round trips to each store. Perhaps there's a more efficient routing system in place.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it says \"makes daily round trips to each store,\" so I have to assume that each store gets a separate round trip each day.\n\nGiven that, the distance calculation stands at 10,000 miles per day per truck.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many trucks each distribution center uses.\n\nThe problem mentions that each distribution center serves 50 stores, and deliveries are made using trucks with a capacity of 20 tons. But it doesn't specify how much each store receives or how often the trucks are filled to capacity.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide information on the delivery volume per store, I might have to assume that each truck is fully utilized for each trip.\n\nBut actually, the capacity of the truck might not be directly relevant to the fuel calculation if we're only concerned with distance traveled.\n\nWait, no. The fuel consumption depends on the truck's characteristics, including its consumption rate, which might be affected by its load. However, the problem states a constant consumption rate of 6 miles per gallon, regardless of the load.\n\nSo, I can proceed with the given consumption rate.\n\nNow, fuel consumption is 6 miles per gallon, and diesel costs $3 per gallon.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much fuel one truck consumes per day.\n\nDaily mileage: 10,000 miles\n\nFuel consumption: 6 miles per gallon\n\nSo, gallons of fuel used per day by one truck:\n\n10,000 miles / 6 miles per gallon = 1,666.67 gallons per day.\n\nThat's a huge amount of fuel for one truck! Let me check if I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that multiple trucks are used by each distribution center, and not just one truck covering all 50 stores.\n\nThe problem says \"each store receives deliveries from one distribution center using trucks with a capacity of 20 tons.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how many trucks each distribution center has. Maybe I need to assume that there are multiple trucks per distribution center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one truck services multiple stores in a day, but the problem says \"makes daily round trips to each store,\" which suggests that each store gets its own round trip per day.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the total number of store-trips per day.\n\nThere are 10 distribution centers, each serving 50 stores, so total stores = 10 * 50 = 500 stores.\n\nEach store gets one round trip per day, so total round trips per day = 500.\n\nEach round trip is 200 miles, so total miles per day = 500 * 200 = 100,000 miles.\n\nNow, if I can find out how many trucks are needed to cover these 100,000 miles per day, I can proceed.\n\nBut perhaps I don't need to know the number of trucks. Maybe I can calculate the total fuel consumption directly.\n\nGiven that fuel consumption is 6 miles per gallon, the total gallons of fuel used per day for all trucks is:\n\nTotal miles per day / miles per gallon = 100,000 miles / 6 mpg = 16,666.67 gallons per day.\n\nAt $3 per gallon, the daily fuel cost is:\n\n16,666.67 gallons * $3/gallon = $50,000 per day.\n\nWait, that seems extraordinarily high. Is there a mistake in my calculations?\n\nLet me double-check the numbers.\n\nTotal stores: 500\n\nRound trips per store per day: 1\n\nMiles per round trip: 200\n\nTotal miles per day: 500 * 200 = 100,000 miles\n\nFuel consumption: 6 miles per gallon\n\nTotal gallons per day: 100,000 / 6 = 16,666.67 gallons\n\nFuel cost per gallon: $3\n\nTotal daily fuel cost: 16,666.67 * 3 = $50,000\n\nHmm, $50,000 per day seems excessively high. Maybe there's an error in the assumptions.\n\nLet me reconsider the problem.\n\nPerhaps it's not that each truck makes a separate round trip to each store every day. Maybe trucks make multiple stops in a day, covering multiple stores in a single trip.\n\nThe problem says \"makes daily round trips to each store.\" But maybe that means each store is visited once per day, but not necessarily that each trip is a separate round trip.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the wording is unclear, and I need to make an assumption.\n\nAnother approach: maybe each distribution center has a fleet of trucks, and each truck services multiple stores in a day.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total miles per day would be less than 100,000 miles.\n\nLet me try to estimate the number of trucks per distribution center.\n\nAssume each truck can make a certain number of round trips per day.\n\nGiven that each round trip is 200 miles and the truck travels at 50 mph, the time for one round trip is:\n\nDistance / speed = 200 miles / 50 mph = 4 hours per round trip.\n\nAssuming the truck operates 8 hours per day, it can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips per day.\n\nTherefore, each truck can serve 2 stores per day.\n\nEach distribution center has 50 stores to serve, so the number of trucks per distribution center is 50 stores / 2 stores per truck per day = 25 trucks.\n\nWait, but if each truck can make 2 round trips per day, serving 2 stores, then for 50 stores, number of trucks needed is 50 / 2 = 25 trucks per distribution center.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes, that seems more reasonable.\n\nSo, each distribution center has 25 trucks, each making 2 round trips per day, serving 2 stores per day, totaling 50 stores.\n\nNow, with 10 distribution centers, total trucks = 10 * 25 = 250 trucks.\n\nEach truck travels 2 round trips per day, each 200 miles, so 400 miles per day.\n\nTotal miles per day for all trucks = 250 trucks * 400 miles/truck/day = 100,000 miles per day.\n\nWait, that's the same total miles as before.\n\nSo, the total fuel consumption remains the same: 100,000 miles / 6 mpg = 16,666.67 gallons per day, costing $50,000 per day.\n\nThis still seems high, but perhaps it's accurate given the parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption about the number of round trips per truck per day is incorrect.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf each truck can travel at 50 mph and operates for, say, 10 hours a day, then it can cover 50 mph * 10 hours = 500 miles per day.\n\nGiven that each round trip is 200 miles, each truck can make 500 / 200 = 2.5 round trips per day.\n\nBut since you can't make half a trip, let's say 2 round trips per day, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, the calculations seem consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total annual fuel cost would be the daily fuel cost multiplied by the number of days in a year.\n\nAssuming 365 days per year:\n\n$50,000 per day * 365 days/year = $18,250,000 per year.\n\nWait, that's the annual fuel cost for all trucks across all distribution centers.\n\nBut let me confirm if this is what the question is asking for.\n\nThe question says: \"Calculate the total annual fuel cost for these deliveries.\"\n\nYes, that seems to be the final answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other factors I should consider.\n\nIs there any information about the utilization of trucks or the loading capacity?\n\nThe problem mentions that trucks have a capacity of 20 tons, but doesn't specify how much each store receives. Maybe some stores require more than others, but without specific information, I can't adjust the calculations.\n\nAlso, the problem states that each store is located within a 100-mile radius, but doesn't specify the exact distance. I assumed an average round trip of 200 miles, which might be acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, the speed is given as 50 mph, which I used to calculate the time per trip.\n\nGiven all that, my calculations seem consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total annual fuel cost is $18,250,000.\n\nBut perhaps I should express it in scientific notation or with a currency symbol.\n\nWait, the problem uses dollars, so $18,250,000 per year.\n\nAlternatively, it might be better to express it as $18.25 million per year.\n\nYes, that's more readable.\n\nSo, the total annual fuel cost for the supermarket chain's deliveries is approximately $18.25 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{18250000}"
