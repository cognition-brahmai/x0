For each plan, indicate which external tool together with tool input to retrieve evidence. You can store the evidence into a variable #Evidence[index] that can be called by later tools.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBingSearch[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information from Bing.  This tool is particularly useful in gaining knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, and other types of factual information.  \nParseHTML[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string and produces plain text output containing the content of the site.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extract URLs from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of URLs.\nAIQA[input]: Artificial Intelligence Question Answering tool that can answer questions either directly from common sense and general world knowledge, as well as answering questions given input context that may contain the answer.\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#Evidence[index]) value.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#Evidence1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #Evidence1]\n#Evidence2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #Evidence1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #Evidence[n]\n\nQuestion: When was the first iPhone released and what were its key features?"
