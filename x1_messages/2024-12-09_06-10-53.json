U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, but he called defective at its core. Reaction is already pouring in, European allies say they regret the U.S. decision, while Iran\\'s president says the U.S. failed to live up to its international commitment under the deal. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on his second surprised trip to North Korea. Donald Trump broke the news while announcing the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran deal. Pompeo will discuss the upcoming talks between Mr. Trump and North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un as well as the U.S. citizens who were detained inside the country. A new outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has been discovered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The World Health Organization says at least two people have tested positive with the disease and they\\'re collecting more samples. Nearly two dozen suspected Ebola cases have been reported in the past few weeks. Iran is warning that it is ready to start nuclear enrichment without limitations tonight. Donald Trump\\'s decisions to resume sanctions on the country puts huge pressure on a government already economically. Earlier this year, there were massive protests against President Hassan Rouhani\\'s government over a stagnant economy and rising fuel and food prices. Tonight, Mr. Rouhani claims Iranians are more united and determined not to let the U.S. triumph. HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT, IRAN (through translator): What this triumph did was a psychological warfare, and as an economical threshold, we will not allow Trump to triumph in exerting pressure, economic pressure on the Iranian people. GOLODRYGA: Rouhani says economic growth will continue, but Iranians have been rushing to buy up U.S. dollars in recent days, skyrocketing the exchange rate on the black market. John Defterios is our emerging markets editor. He\\'s in Bahrain and has been speaking to the head of OPEC, obviously John in a situation like this especially in that region, oil prices are the first things that come to mind for traders around the world. What was your reaction and what did you hear from your interview with OPEC? JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, volatility, Bianna, was the watch word throughout the day, not knowing which way Donald Trump would land on the new sanctions. He said they\\'re going to be very tough going forward and that\\'s the reason we\\'re stabilizing on North Sea brent, the international benchmark at around $75 a barrel, and that\\'s right near a four-year high. Now, President Trump has made his decision very well known, but there are still a number of unknowns if I can put it that way, just put the Europeans at the top of the list here. Do the European companies, particularly oil giants have the backbone to try to stay in Iran while they have big stakes in the U.S. market as well. Total tops a list with an investment in Iran not finalized that are worth $5 billion at one point, Patrick Pouyanne, the CEO told me they would be seeking an exemption from the United States. I\\'m not sure that\\'s still going to be the case. And if Italy wants to go in, Russia has engaged with Iran in a very large way, I can\\'t see them backing out, CNPC of China has been involved in Iran for years and helping them during that tough period of sanctions, they will stay engaged of course with Iran. But this is going to be hitting a very tight oil market, Bianna, because of the OPEC, non-OPEC agreement that take 1.8 million barrels a day off the market. The secretary general told me in an exclusive interview while I was in Doha that this is hitting at the wrong time and could even threaten the global economy. He does not think it\\'s a good idea although he wanted to try to steer clear of the Iranian issue, he\\'s worried about the market. Let\\'s take a listen. MOHAMMED BARKINDO, SECRETARY GENERAL, OPEC: For us, we are focused on stability. Whatever extraneous factor that affects supply or demand will no doubt send market into disequilibrium, which is not in the interest of producers or the interest of consumers. We look up to our leaders to ensure that peace and stability especially in our regions is sustained. DEFTERIOS: Do you advise it at this stage, knowing the state of the market and the state of tensions? BARKINDO: We are not -- we are not in the business of dialoguing on policy issues such as nuclear, such as solar or other sources of energy. All what we are focused on is on this industry. And whatever will affect the smooth running of this industry, the smooth extraction, production, processing, transportation, marketing of oil in this market of today will not be in the interest of the global economy. DEFTERIOS: As we sit today, is there a risk that higher prices will boomerang and actually kill off demand that has to be a concerned of your at this stage, secretary general? BARKINDO: I think it is premature at the moment. What we are seeing spikes -- price spikes being driven by the volatility that occasionally recounts for the market as a result of these geopolitical tensions. When we look at the market, we evaluate markets both on the short, medium and long term. And we look at the market in holistic terms in reaching decisions. GOLODRYGA: The secretary general, you could see carefully choosing his words to come across as diplomatic and not wade into the politics. But it\\'s clear that stability is their number one goal. What we\\'re not seeing when we hear headlines like the U.S. getting out of an Iran deal, an international deal. The first one becomes a minus not stability. DEFTERIOS: Yes, in fact, Bianna, I think we have to watch out also for unity within the OPEC, not OPEC apparatus. Saudi Arabia is the only major producer that has the spare capacity right now. There\\'s a thought in Riyadh, they would like to have a higher price to support the Aramco IPO. Iran has taken the exact opposite position. So we have to watch the tensions within OPEC between Saudi Arabia and Iran and the influences could exercise over Russia. I also think Iran is trying to put a very brave face on this economy right now, Bianna. The first vice president of the Central Bank Governor said we can survive this. The Iranians have been faced with a great deal, but they\\'ve been going sideways, actually backwards for the last ten years with its clients of household incomes of 15 percent, they lost 10 percent of their GDP over the last five years. This is a painful period of time even though the Iranians were trying to put a brave face on it, the latest news from President Rouhani which I thought was interesting, he said now they will proceed with the other five countries, \"if the Iranians interest are protected.\" So now, they\\'re suggesting they will stay engaged if the Europeans, the Russians and the Chinese stay with them as well. This is key for the Iranian economy going forward. GOLODRYGA: Yes, no doubt, a lot of pressure on President Rouhani, one has to wonder where did he over promise to his own people in terms of the delivery from a nuclear deal in terms of economic growth there at home. We\\'re going to have to leave it there, John, thank you so much for joining us. Well, Donald Trump says he is willing to negotiate a new deal with Iran even if he doesn\\'t expect cooperation with Tehran to come immediately. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Iran\\'s leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal, they refuse, and that\\'s fine. I\\'d probably say the same thing if I was in their position. But the fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people. When they do, I am ready, willing and able. GOLODRYGA: Robin Niblett is the director of Chatham House, he is joining us from London. And Robin, you hear a recurring message from the president when he speaks about any sort of trade deals or any sort of international deal with another country be it China and even North Korea where he says I can understand where they\\'re coming from. But talk about that tactic and is it productive at all? ROBIN NIBLETT, DIRECTOR, CHATHAM HOUSE: Well, the tactic is that any deal that Donald Trump didn\\'t negotiate before hand, using the full might of U.S. power was necessarily not a good deal from the U.S. standpoint. So you could see going through on picking each of the established deal side of Obama or even his predecessors and try to reapply to them a full might of American power, not through a multilateral structure, but through that weight you get when you apply bilaterally the size of America against another small country. Is it effective? Well, it certainly gets people\\'s attention, it gets both the allies attention, whether it\\'s the Europeans on steel or South Koreans on North Korea. But of course, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state is going over to do a deal potentially with North Korea. But North Korea could end -- not remaining as a nuclear power. So it might be a deal, you might have a stable Korean Peninsula, but whether America is actually getting what it claimed it was going to get at the beginning is doubtful, and I think the same thing on Iran. I don\\'t think Iran is going to play America\\'s game, I don\\'t think China is going to play America\\'s game and Europe isn\\'t playing America\\'s game. GOLODRYGA: Yes, and the president seems to be talking about a policy or a tactic where you squeeze Iran enough, they will come to the table. I feel though that we\\'ve tried that in that past and that necessarily wasn\\'t the reaction that we saw from the Iranians. What if anything do you think gives the president hope that this time would be different? NIBLETT: I don\\'t know, I mean, the thing on the one hand, there\\'s another dynamic here which is the United States president, President Trump promised that he would pull out of the Iran deal, and what he\\'s doing is he\\'s going through each of his succession of campaign promises and fulfilling them. And I think he believes there\\'s a bigger picture here which is that he will be trusted to do what he says in the context of his position with an American domestic politics, maybe not the mid-terms but certainly when it comes to the next presidential election. Assuming we get the -- I think he thinks this is going to stand, I mean, good stead. So there\\'s a -- there\\'s a moment of domestic politics here. I think it\\'s well, he believes that by shaking things up and creating a little bit of space, actually, he can maybe come back and what it looks like a -- take it or leave it position and then make it, well, let\\'s do a deal. We have this on North Korea, fire and fury has now become Pompeo and a bilateral meeting. He\\'s trying to stay with the Chinese on trade not working quite so well. Maybe things that could happen with Iran and you pointed to point that way, he said, you know, let\\'s try and do a deal later on if you come back to the table. Each of his excuse is, leave a little room, six months to leave sanctions are fully implemented, they kind of kick off in about 90 days time. There\\'s room to come back and negotiate. GOLODRYGA: Yes -- NIBLETT: One more thing, I think he thinks the Europeans might do his work for him as well and negotiate something on the bilateral side. GOLODRYGA: Well, Robins, we talk about Iran, but of course one has to assume who else is watching, that\\'s Kim Jong-un in North Korea and whether or not he will act any differently or come to the table with any other proposals or not, given what he\\'s just seen the president do. We shall see as we know the secretary of state is on his way there now. Robin, thank you so much for joining us tonight, have a good evening. NIBLETT: Thank you. GOLODRYGA: And after the break, the fox hunt heads up -- heats up. A takeover war sets old rivals Comcast and Disney against each other in a bid for buying up Rupert Murdoch\\'s media empire.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
