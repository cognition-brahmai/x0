        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students. Out of these, 14 play soccer, 17 play basketball, and 6 don't play any sports. We need to find out how many students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students actually play some sport. Since there are 30 students in total and 6 don't play any sports, that means 30 - 6 = 24 students play some sport, right?\n\nNow, out of these 24 students, some play soccer, some play basketball, and some might play both. The numbers given are 14 play soccer and 17 play basketball. But if I add those up, 14 + 17 = 31, which is more than the 24 students who play sports. That means some students must be counted in both groups because they play both sports.\n\nTo find out how many play both, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the total number of students playing sports would be:\n\nTotal playing sports = number playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n24 = 14 + 17 - both\n\nNow, solving for \"both\":\n\n24 = 31 - both\n\nBoth = 31 - 24\n\nBoth = 7\n\nTherefore, 7 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If 14 play soccer and 17 play basketball, and 7 play both, then the number of students playing only soccer would be 14 - 7 = 7, and only basketball would be 17 - 7 = 10. Adding those up: 7 (only soccer) + 10 (only basketball) + 7 (both) = 24, which matches the total number of students playing sports. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be 7 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
