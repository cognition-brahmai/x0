Differences in temperature and salinity\nThermohaline circulation, also known as the global conveyor belt, is primarily driven by differences in temperature and salinity of ocean water. These factors affect the density of seawater, with colder and saltier water being denser and thus sinking, while warmer and less salty water tends to rise. This creates a slow-moving current that circulates water around the globe, playing a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate by distributing heat and nutrients."
