        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. The mayor paints even-numbered houses blue and odd-numbered houses red. I need to find out how many more blue houses there are than red houses.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many even-numbered houses there are and how many odd-numbered houses there are. Since the houses are numbered from 1 to 100, I can assume that the numbers are consecutive integers.\n\nI know that in a sequence of consecutive integers, half of them are even and half are odd, provided that the sequence starts with an odd or even number and ends with the opposite parity. Wait, here the sequence starts at 1, which is odd, and ends at 100, which is even. So, does that mean there are equal numbers of even and odd houses?\n\nLet me check. If I have houses numbered 1 to 100:\n\n- House 1: odd\n\n- House 2: even\n\n- House 3: odd\n\n- House 4: even\n\n- ...\n\n- House 99: odd\n\n- House 100: even\n\nSo, it alternates between odd and even. Since there are 100 houses, and it starts with odd and ends with even, there should be 50 odd and 50 even houses.\n\nWait, but let's confirm that. The number of even numbers from 1 to 100 is the floor of 100/2), which is 50. Similarly, the number of odd numbers is also 50.\n\nSo, there are 50 blue houses and 50 red houses.\n\nTherefore, the difference between blue and red houses is 50 - 50 = 0.\n\nWait, but the question is \"how many more blue houses are there than red houses?\" If there are equal numbers, the answer should be zero. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any possibility that the count is different because of the way numbers are distributed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the house numbers include zero or go beyond 100, but the problem says from 1 to 100, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the painting rule is different, but it clearly states that even-numbered houses are painted blue and odd-numbered houses are painted red.\n\nSo, unless there's some trick here that I'm not seeing, it seems straightforward that there are equal numbers of blue and red houses, making the difference zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the house numbers are not exclusively even and odd; maybe some houses have numbers that are neither even nor odd, but that doesn't make sense because all integers are either even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mayor paints some houses differently based on other criteria, but the problem doesn't mention any other criteria.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the houses are numbered in a non-consecutive manner, but the problem says \"numbered from 1 to 100,\" which implies consecutive numbering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mayor paints houses based on their position in the village or some other factor, but again, the problem specifies based on even or odd house numbers.\n\nSo, I think the answer is that there are equal numbers of blue and red houses, meaning there are zero more blue houses than red houses.\n\nBut maybe the question is trying to trick me, suggesting that there are more even numbers than odd numbers in a certain range, but in reality, in any range from 1 to n, where n is even, the number of even and odd numbers is equal.\n\nWait, but if n were odd, then there would be one more odd number than even numbers. For example, from 1 to 3: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd) \u2014 so two odd and one even.\n\nBut in this case, n is 100, which is even, so the number of even and odd numbers should be equal.\n\nTherefore, the difference is zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps the house numbers include zero, but the problem says from 1 to 100, so zero is not included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some houses are numbered with the same number, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the village has houses with non-integer numbers, but again, the problem specifies \"numbered from 1 to 100,\" which implies integer numbering.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there are 50 blue houses and 50 red houses, making the difference zero.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider writing a small program or using a formula to count the number of even and odd numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nNumber of even numbers = floor(n/2)\n\nNumber of odd numbers = ceil(n/2)\n\nWhere n is 100.\n\nFloor(100/2) = 50\n\nCeil(100/2) = 50\n\nSo, again, 50 even and 50 odd.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nNumber of even numbers = (n + 1) / 2 if n is odd, else n/2\n\nNumber of odd numbers = (n + 1) / 2 if n is even, else (n + 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems confusing.\n\nActually, a better way is:\n\n- If n is even, number of even numbers = n/2\n\n- Number of odd numbers = n/2\n\n- If n is odd, number of even numbers = floor(n/2)\n\n- Number of odd numbers = ceil(n/2)\n\nSince n is 100, which is even, number of even and odd numbers are both 50.\n\nTherefore, the difference is zero.\n\nSo, the answer should be zero.\n\nBut perhaps the question is misphrased or there is some misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mayor paints houses with even sums of digits in their number blue, and odd sums red, but the problem specifically says based on even or odd house numbers.\n\nWait, the problem says \"paints all even-numbered houses with blue and all odd-numbered houses with red.\"\n\nSo, it's based on the house number itself being even or odd, not on the sum of digits or any other property.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion stands: there are equal numbers of blue and red houses, so the difference is zero.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any houses that are not painted at all, but the problem says all houses are painted based on their number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some houses are painted differently based on some other rule, but the problem doesn't mention any exceptions.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
