        "content": "Implementing a Python script to read a CSV file and convert it to JSON format is a straightforward task that can be accomplished using built-in modules such as `csv` and `json`. Below is a step-by-step guide and a sample script to achieve this.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Read the CSV File:**\n   - Use the `csv` module to read the CSV file.\n   - Assume the first row contains headers which will be used as keys in the JSON.\n\n2. **Convert CSV Data to a List of Dictionaries:**\n   - Each row in the CSV file will be converted into a dictionary where keys are the column headers and values are the corresponding cell values.\n\n3. **Write the Data to a JSON File:**\n   - Use the `json` module to dump the list of dictionaries into a JSON file.\n\n### Sample Script:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport json\n\ndef csv_to_json(csv_file_path, json_file_path):\n    # Read the CSV file\n    with open(csv_file_path, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as csv_file:\n        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)\n        \n        # Convert CSV data to a list of dictionaries\n        data = [row for row in csv_reader]\n    \n    # Write the data to a JSON file\n    with open(json_file_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as json_file:\n        json.dump(data, json_file, indent=4)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    csv_path = 'sample.csv'  # Replace with your CSV file path\n    json_path = 'output.json'  # Replace with your desired JSON file path\n    csv_to_json(csv_path, json_path)\n    print(f\"CSV file '{csv_path}' has been converted to JSON file '{json_path}'\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Reading the CSV File:**\n   - `csv.DictReader` is used to read the CSV file. It automatically uses the first row as headers and maps the values in each row to these headers.\n\n2. **Converting to JSON:**\n   - The data read from the CSV is a list of dictionaries, which is directly serializable to JSON using `json.dump`.\n\n3. **Handling Files:**\n   - The script opens both the CSV and JSON files using context managers (`with` statements) to ensure proper handling and closing of files.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **CSV File Format:**\n  - Ensure the CSV file has a header row. If not, you might need to specify fieldnames manually.\n\n- **Error Handling:**\n  - For production-level code, consider adding error handling to manage cases like missing files or invalid formats.\n\n- **Customization:**\n  - You can modify the script to handle different delimiters or quoting styles by passing appropriate parameters to `csv.DictReader`.\n\nThis script provides a basic but effective way to convert CSV data to JSON format in Python."
