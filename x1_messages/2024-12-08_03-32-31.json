        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a factory that produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit for A is $8, and for B, it's $12. The factory wants to produce a total of 500 units and maximize its profit. I need to figure out how many units of each product they should make.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are two products, A and B, and the factory has to produce a total of 500 units combined of both. The goal is to maximize profit, given that A makes $8 per unit and B makes $12 per unit.\n\nSo, I think the key here is to produce more of the product that has higher profit per unit, right? Since B has a higher profit per unit ($12 vs. $8), producing more B would maximize the profit.\n\nWait, but maybe there are constraints I'm not considering. The problem says \"a total of 500 units,\" but it doesn't specify any other limitations, like production capacity or demand for each product. Assuming there are no other constraints, the straightforward approach would be to produce only product B.\n\nLet me think about that. If they produce 500 units of B, the profit would be 500 * $12 = $6,000. If they produce some combination of A and B, the profit would be less unless B is produced more.\n\nBut maybe there's a mix that could maximize profit better. Let's try to set up an equation.\n\nLet x be the number of units of A, and y be the number of units of B.\n\nWe know that x + y = 500 (since total production is 500 units).\n\nThe profit function would be P = 8x + 12y.\n\nOur goal is to maximize P, given the constraint x + y = 500.\n\nFrom the constraint, y = 500 - x.\n\nSubstituting into the profit function: P = 8x + 12(500 - x) = 8x + 6000 - 12x = -4x + 6000.\n\nSo P = -4x + 6000.\n\nThis is a linear function, and since the coefficient of x is negative (-4), the profit decreases as x increases. Therefore, to maximize P, x should be as small as possible.\n\nGiven that x >= 0, the minimum x can be is 0.\n\nSo, x = 0, y = 500.\n\nTherefore, producing 0 units of A and 500 units of B would maximize the profit, which would be $6,000.\n\nBut wait, is there any reason why they couldn't do that? Maybe there are other constraints not mentioned in the problem, like demand for product A, or production capacity limitations for B, but based on the information given, this seems to be the answer.\n\nLet me check again. If they produce even one unit of A, the profit would be P = 8(1) + 12(499) = 8 + 5988 = $5996, which is less than $6,000.\n\nSimilarly, if x = 100, P = 8(100) + 12(400) = 800 + 4800 = $5,600, which is still less than $6,000.\n\nSo, yes, producing only product B maximizes the profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0 \\text{ units of A and } 500 \\text{ units of B}} \\]"
