        "content": "So I've got this problem: a movie theater has 15 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. I need to find out how many seats there are in total in the theater. And I have to show my work.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. It's pretty straightforward\u2014there are multiple rows, each with the same number of seats, and I need to find the total number of seats. So, basically, it's a multiplication problem.\n\nI remember that to find the total number of something when there are groups with an equal amount in each, I can multiply the number of groups by the amount in each group. In this case, the groups are the rows, and the amount in each group is the number of seats per row.\n\nSo, number of rows is 15, and each row has 18 seats. Therefore, total seats should be 15 times 18.\n\nNow, how do I calculate 15 times 18? I can do this in a few ways. One way is to multiply 15 by 10 and then 15 by 8, and then add those two results together. That's because 18 is equal to 10 plus 8.\n\nSo, first, 15 times 10 is 150.\n\nSecond, 15 times 8 is 120.\n\nNow, I add those two results: 150 plus 120 equals 270.\n\nTherefore, the total number of seats in the theater is 270.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to verify this answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 15 times 18 is the same as 15 times 20 minus 15 times 2. Because 18 is 20 minus 2.\n\nSo, 15 times 20 is 300.\n\nThen, 15 times 2 is 30.\n\nSubtracting those, 300 minus 30 gives 270 again.\n\nOkay, that matches my first answer. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 15 times 18 being 15 times (10 + 8), which is the same as 15 times 10 plus 15 times 8, which is again 150 plus 120, equaling 270.\n\nYet another way to confirm is to use long multiplication.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n18\n\ntimes 15\n\nFirst, multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. Write down 0, carry over 4.\n\nThen, 8 times 1 is 8, plus the carried over 4 is 12. So, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNow, on the next row, multiply 1 by 5, which is 5, plus the carried over 1 is 6.\n\nThen, 1 times 1 is 1.\n\nSo, the result is 270.\n\nWait, no. Actually, let's do that again. Maybe I messed up the long multiplication.\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n```\n\n18\n\ntimes 15\n\n```\n\nFirst, multiply 18 by 5 (the ones place of 15):\n\n8 times 5 is 40. Write down 0, carry over 4.\n\nThen, 1 times 5 is 5, plus the carried over 4 is 9.\n\nSo, that gives 90.\n\nNext, multiply 18 by 10 (the tens place of 15):\n\n18 times 10 is 180.\n\nNow, add those two results together: 90 plus 180 equals 270.\n\nOkay, that matches again.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the commutative property of multiplication, which says that the order of multiplication doesn't matter. So, 15 times 18 is the same as 18 times 15.\n\nLet me try 18 times 15.\n\n18 times 10 is 180.\n\n18 times 5 is 90.\n\nAdd them together: 180 plus 90 is 270.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the distributive property, I can break down the numbers differently.\n\nFor example, 15 is 10 plus 5.\n\nSo, 18 times 15 is 18 times 10 plus 18 times 5, which is 180 plus 90, equaling 270.\n\nOr, breaking down 18: 18 is 20 minus 2.\n\nSo, 15 times 18 is 15 times 20 minus 15 times 2, which is 300 minus 30, equaling 270.\n\nNo matter how I slice it, I keep getting 270.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the total number of seats in the theater is 270.\n\nBut, to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total number of seats.\n\nFor example, are there any seats that might be blocked or not available? Or maybe there are different sections with different numbers of seats.\n\nBut according to the problem, there are 15 rows, each with 18 seats, and nothing is mentioned about any seats being blocked or any variations in the number of seats per row.\n\nSo, I can assume that every row has exactly 18 seats, and there are no obstructed seats or anything like that.\n\nTherefore, the total number of seats is indeed 15 times 18, which is 270.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the seating arrangement affects the total number. For example, in some theaters, there might be staggered seating, where every other row has fewer seats.\n\nBut again, the problem states that each row has 18 seats, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the theater has some premium seating areas with fewer seats but more space. But again, the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I can ignore it.\n\nI think I've considered all possible angles, and the answer remains 270 seats.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try another method. Let's say I add up the seats row by row.\n\nSo, row 1: 18 seats\n\nRow 2: 18 seats\n\n...\n\nUp to row 15.\n\nSo, it's adding 18 fifteen times.\n\nThat's 18 + 18 + ... + 18 (15 times).\n\nWell, adding 18 fifteen times is the same as 18 times 15, which is again 270.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 15 groups of 18 seats each, which again is 15 times 18, equaling 270.\n\nI even remember that in some theaters, the number of seats per row increases as you go further back, but again, the problem specifies that each row has exactly 18 seats, so that's not applicable here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the aisles affect the seating. Sometimes, aisles can take up a few seats in each row.\n\nBut since the problem states that each row has 18 seats, I think it's safe to assume that the aisle seats are included in those 18 seats.\n\nTherefore, no need to adjust for aisles.\n\nMoreover, perhaps some rows have reserved seats or special seating, but again, without any information indicating that, I'll assume all rows are equal.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total number of seats in the theater is 270.\n\nTo present this clearly, I can write:\n\nTotal seats = number of rows \u00d7 seats per row\n\nTotal seats = 15 \u00d7 18\n\nTotal seats = 270\n\nAnd there you have it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
