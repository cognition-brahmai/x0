        "content": "Let's see. The factory originally produces 150 units every day. Then, they decide to operate for two extra hours each day, which leads to a 25% increase in their daily production. I need to find out how many units are produced in total during a 30-day month with this increased production rate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the new daily production rate is after the increase. If they had 150 units per day and there's a 25% increase, I can calculate the increased amount and add it to the original production.\n\nSo, 25% of 150 units is:\n\n25% of 150 = (25/100) * 150 = 0.25 * 150 = 37.5 units\n\nTherefore, the new daily production is:\n\n150 units + 37.5 units = 187.5 units per day\n\nNow, to find out the total production for a 30-day month at this new rate, I'll multiply the daily production by 30.\n\nTotal production = 187.5 units/day * 30 days\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n187.5 * 30\n\nWell, 187.5 times 30 is the same as 187.5 multiplied by 3 and then multiplied by 10.\n\nFirst, 187.5 * 3 = 562.5\n\nThen, 562.5 * 10 = 5,625\n\nSo, the total production for the month is 5,625 units.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since there's a 25% increase in production due to the extra two hours, maybe I can think about the original production rate and the increase separately.\n\nOriginal daily production: 150 units\n\nIncrease: 25% of 150 = 37.5 units\n\nNew daily production: 150 + 37.5 = 187.5 units per day\n\nThen, for 30 days: 187.5 * 30 = 5,625 units\n\nAlternatively, since it's a 25% increase, the new production is 125% of the original production.\n\nSo, 125% of 150 units = (125/100) * 150 = 1.25 * 150 = 187.5 units per day\n\nAgain, multiplying by 30 days gives 5,625 units.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can consider the hourly production rate.\n\nSuppose the factory originally operates for a certain number of hours each day, and by adding two extra hours, they achieve a 25% increase in production.\n\nLet's assume the original operating hours per day are H hours.\n\nThen, the original production rate is 150 units per H hours, so the hourly production rate is 150/H units per hour.\n\nWith two extra hours, the total operating hours become H + 2 hours.\n\nThe new daily production is then (H + 2) * (150/H) units.\n\nAccording to the problem, this new production is 25% more than the original 150 units.\n\nSo:\n\n(H + 2) * (150/H) = 150 + 0.25*150 = 150 + 37.5 = 187.5 units\n\nNow, let's solve for H:\n\n(H + 2) * (150/H) = 187.5\n\nMultiply both sides by H:\n\n(H + 2)*150 = 187.5 H\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n150H + 300 = 187.5 H\n\nNow, subtract 150H from both sides:\n\n300 = 37.5 H\n\nThen, divide both sides by 37.5:\n\nH = 300 / 37.5 = 8 hours\n\nSo, the original operating hours per day are 8 hours.\n\nNow, with two extra hours, the total operating hours per day are 8 + 2 = 10 hours.\n\nThe hourly production rate is 150 units / 8 hours = 18.75 units per hour.\n\nTherefore, the new daily production is 10 hours * 18.75 units/hour = 187.5 units per day.\n\nMultiplying by 30 days gives 187.5 * 30 = 5,625 units.\n\nEverything points to the same answer: 5,625 units produced in total during the 30-day month with the increased production rate.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5625} \\]"
