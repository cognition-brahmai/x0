        "content": "Let's calculate the total cost of the candies the customer bought. We have three types of candies with different prices, and the customer bought varying quantities of each. I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, type A candies cost $1.50 each, and the customer bought 6 pieces. So, the cost for type A is 6 times $1.50. Let me do that multiplication:\n\n6 \u00d7 1.50 = 9.00\n\nSo, type A candies cost $9.00 in total.\n\nNext, type B candies cost $2.00 each, and the customer bought 4 pieces. The cost for type B is 4 times $2.00:\n\n4 \u00d7 2.00 = 8.00\n\nSo, type B candies cost $8.00 in total.\n\nThen, type C candies cost $3.00 each, and the customer bought 2 pieces. The cost for type C is 2 times $3.00:\n\n2 \u00d7 3.00 = 6.00\n\nSo, type C candies cost $6.00 in total.\n\nNow, to find the total cost of all the candies, I need to add up the costs of types A, B, and C:\n\n9.00 + 8.00 + 6.00 = 23.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $23.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23.00} \\]"
