        "content": "So the bookstore sells books at an average price of $12 each. On Monday, they sold 250 books, and on Tuesday, they sold 350 books. We need to find out how much revenue they made over these two days.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the revenue for each day separately and then add them together to get the total revenue. Does that make sense?\n\nSo, for Monday, if they sold 250 books at $12 each, the revenue for Monday would be 250 multiplied by 12. Similarly, for Tuesday, it's 350 multiplied by 12. Then, I add those two amounts together to get the total revenue for both days.\n\nLet me do the math for Monday first. 250 times 12. Well, 250 times 10 is 2,500, and 250 times 2 is 500, so added together that's 3,000. So, $3,000 on Monday.\n\nNow, for Tuesday, 350 times 12. 350 times 10 is 3,500, and 350 times 2 is 700, so added together that's 4,200. So, $4,200 on Tuesday.\n\nNow, to find the total revenue for both days, I add Monday and Tuesday together: 3,000 plus 4,200, which equals 7,200.\n\nSo, the total revenue generated over Monday and Tuesday is $7,200.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to double-check my answer?\n\nWell, another way could be to add the number of books sold on both days first and then multiply by the average price per book.\n\nSo, total books sold: 250 on Monday plus 350 on Tuesday, which is 600 books in total.\n\nThen, multiply the total number of books by the average price per book: 600 times 12.\n\nLet's calculate that. 600 times 10 is 6,000, and 600 times 2 is 1,200, so added together that's 7,200.\n\nSo, again, $7,200.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct total revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7200} \\]\n"
