For each step, indicate the corresponding evidence value, which would be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools are as follows:\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that enables users to perform a search on the web. It locates a list of sites that might contain the answer but does not directly provide the answer.\nSiteReader[input]: Load one or multiple websites from the input string containing newline separated links, where input is one or several links, and generates plain text output containing the link contents.\nUrlCollector[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and returns a plain text, newline separated response of URLs.\nKnowledgeBot[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text.  The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput should be formatted as follows:\nPlan: [First action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: Containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?"
