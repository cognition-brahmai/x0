It's often referred to as the \"Black Album\" due to its minimalist black cover design. However, another album that might fit your description is Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album, often called the \"Led Zeppelin IV\" or the \"Four Symbols\" album, released in 1971, which also has a black background on its cover. But the term \"Black Album\" is more commonly associated with the Beatles' \"Let It Be.\" Could you please clarify which album you're thinking of?"
