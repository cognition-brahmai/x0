        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence where each term is defined by the formula x_n = 2x_(n-1) + 3, and the first term x_1 is 5. I need to find the value of x_6. Okay, so I'll start by understanding the pattern.\n\nSo, the formula says that any term x_n is equal to twice the previous term x_(n-1) plus 3. That means each term is dependent on the one before it. Since I know x_1, I can find x_2, then x_3, and so on, up to x_6.\n\nLet me write down the terms one by one.\n\nStarting with x_1 = 5.\n\nNow, x_2 = 2 * x_1 + 3 = 2 * 5 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13.\n\nNext, x_3 = 2 * x_2 + 3 = 2 * 13 + 3 = 26 + 3 = 29.\n\nThen, x_4 = 2 * x_3 + 3 = 2 * 29 + 3 = 58 + 3 = 61.\n\nAfter that, x_5 = 2 * x_4 + 3 = 2 * 61 + 3 = 122 + 3 = 125.\n\nFinally, x_6 = 2 * x_5 + 3 = 2 * 125 + 3 = 250 + 3 = 253.\n\nSo, the value of x_6 is 253.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes. Starting from x_1 = 5:\n\n- x_2 = 2*5 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \u2705\n\n- x_3 = 2*13 + 3 = 26 + 3 = 29 \u2705\n\n- x_4 = 2*29 + 3 = 58 + 3 = 61 \u2705\n\n- x_5 = 2*61 + 3 = 122 + 3 = 125 \u2705\n\n- x_6 = 2*125 + 3 = 250 + 3 = 253 \u2705\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to find a general formula for x_n. The sequence is defined recursively as x_n = 2x_(n-1) + 3. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for x_n.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: x_n - 2x_(n-1) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 2 = 0, so r = 2.\n\nThus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is x_n^{(h)} = a * 2^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), I can assume a particular solution of the form x_n^{(p)} = c, where c is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\nc = 2*c + 3\n\nc - 2*c = 3\n\n- c = 3\n\nc = -3\n\nSo, the particular solution is x_n^{(p)} = -3.\n\nTherefore, the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is:\n\nx_n = x_n^{(h)} + x_n^{(p)} = a * 2^n - 3\n\nNow, use the initial condition x_1 = 5 to find a.\n\nx_1 = a * 2^1 - 3 = 2a - 3 = 5\n\n2a - 3 = 5\n\n2a = 8\n\na = 4\n\nThus, the general formula for x_n is:\n\nx_n = 4 * 2^n - 3\n\nSimplify 4 * 2^n:\n\nx_n = 2^2 * 2^n = 2^{n+2} - 3\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: x_1 = 2^{3} - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \u2705\n\nFor n=2: x_2 = 2^{4} - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \u2705\n\nFor n=3: x_3 = 2^{5} - 3 = 32 - 3 = 29 \u2705\n\nFor n=4: x_4 = 2^{6} - 3 = 64 - 3 = 61 \u2705\n\nFor n=5: x_5 = 2^{7} - 3 = 128 - 3 = 125 \u2705\n\nFor n=6: x_6 = 2^{8} - 3 = 256 - 3 = 253 \u2705\n\nPerfect, the formula holds true for the terms we calculated earlier.\n\nSo, using either the recursive method or the closed-form formula, we arrive at x_6 = 253.\n\nTherefore, the value of x_6 is 253.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{253} \\]"
