        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I have 50 coins that add up to $1.00, and I need to figure out how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that would be. To make it easier, I'll assign variables to each type of coin:\n\n- Let q be the number of quarters (each worth $0.25)\n\n- Let d be the number of dimes (each worth $0.10)\n\n- Let n be the number of nickels (each worth $0.05)\n\n- Let p be the number of pennies (each worth $0.01)\n\nI know two main things:\n\n1. The total number of coins is 50.\n\n2. The total value of the coins is $1.00.\n\nSo, I can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nFirst, the total number of coins:\n\nq + d + n + p = 50\n\nSecond, the total value of the coins:\n\n0.25q + 0.10d + 0.05n + 0.01p = 1.00\n\nThese are both in terms of the variables q, d, n, and p, but I have only two equations and four variables. That seems like not enough information, but maybe I can find a way to relate some of these variables.\n\nPerhaps I can try to express some variables in terms of others to reduce the number of unknowns.\n\nLet me consider that pennies are the smallest denomination, and maybe there's a way to express the total in terms that eliminate pennies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the maximum number of quarters I could have and see if that fits with the total number of coins and the total value.\n\nLet's think about the maximum number of quarters possible. Each quarter is $0.25, so four quarters would make $1.00. But that would only be four coins, and I need 50 coins. That's way more than four coins, so I can't have four quarters. In fact, having even one quarter would leave me with 49 coins to make up the remaining $0.75.\n\nWait, that might not be the best approach. Maybe I should consider the value of the coins without quarters first and see if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the number of nickels and dimes and how they contribute to the total value.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can consider that nickels and dimes are both multiples of five cents, so perhaps I can group them together.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say that the combined number of nickels and dimes is some number, but I\u2019m not sure that helps directly.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps I can set up the equations and try to manipulate them to find relationships between the variables.\n\nSo, starting with the two equations:\n\n1. q + d + n + p = 50\n\n2. 0.25q + 0.10d + 0.05n + 0.01p = 1.00\n\nTo eliminate decimals, maybe I can multiply the second equation by 100 to work with whole numbers:\n\n1. q + d + n + p = 50\n\n2. 25q + 10d + 5n + p = 100\n\nNow, I have both equations with whole numbers.\n\nMaybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate p:\n\n(25q + 10d + 5n + p) - (q + d + n + p) = 100 - 50\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n24q + 9d + 4n = 50\n\nOkay, now I have:\n\n24q + 9d + 4n = 50\n\nThat seems a bit messy. Maybe I can look for integer solutions to this equation, given that q, d, n, and p must all be non-negative integers.\n\nLet me consider possible values for q, since quarters have the highest value.\n\nLet's try q = 0:\n\nIf q = 0, then:\n\n9d + 4n = 50\n\nI need to find non-negative integers d and n that satisfy this.\n\nLet's see, maybe d = 2, then 9*2 = 18, so 4n = 32, n = 8. That works: 9*2 + 4*8 = 18 + 32 = 50.\n\nSo, q = 0, d = 2, n = 8, then p = 50 - 0 - 2 - 8 = 40.\n\nCheck the total value: 0*0.25 + 2*0.10 + 8*0.05 + 40*0.01 = 0 + 0.20 + 0.40 + 0.40 = 1.00. That works.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"50 coins totaling $1.00,\" and this is one possible solution: 0 quarters, 2 dimes, 8 nickels, and 40 pennies.\n\nBut maybe there are other solutions. Let's see if q can be higher than 0.\n\nTry q = 1:\n\nThen, 24*1 + 9d + 4n = 50 \u21d2 9d + 4n = 26\n\nFind d and n such that 9d + 4n = 26.\n\nPossible d values:\n\nd = 0: 4n = 26 \u21d2 n = 6.5, not integer.\n\nd = 1: 9*1 + 4n = 26 \u21d2 4n = 17 \u21d2 n = 4.25, not integer.\n\nd = 2: 9*2 + 4n = 26 \u21d2 18 + 4n = 26 \u21d2 4n = 8 \u21d2 n = 2.\n\nSo, q = 1, d = 2, n = 2, p = 50 - 1 - 2 - 2 = 45.\n\nCheck the total value: 1*0.25 + 2*0.10 + 2*0.05 + 45*0.01 = 0.25 + 0.20 + 0.10 + 0.45 = 1.00. That works too.\n\nAnother solution.\n\nTry q = 2:\n\nThen, 24*2 + 9d + 4n = 50 \u21d2 48 + 9d + 4n = 50 \u21d2 9d + 4n = 2.\n\nPossible d values:\n\nd = 0: 4n = 2 \u21d2 n = 0.5, not integer.\n\nd = 1: 9*1 + 4n = 2 \u21d2 9 + 4n = 2 \u21d2 4n = -7, not possible.\n\nSo, q cannot be 2.\n\nTry q = 3:\n\n24*3 + 9d + 4n = 50 \u21d2 72 + 9d + 4n = 50 \u21d2 9d + 4n = -22. Not possible.\n\nSo, q can only be 0, 1.\n\nThus, there are two possible solutions:\n\n1. q = 0, d = 2, n = 8, p = 40\n\n2. q = 1, d = 2, n = 2, p = 45\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies do you have?\" It seems like it's expecting a single answer, but there are actually two possible combinations that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nMaybe there's another way to approach this to confirm if there are indeed two solutions or if one is more correct than the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing that would eliminate one of these solutions.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"You have 50 coins totaling $1.00. How many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies do you have? Show your reasoning.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify that there must be at least one of each type of coin, so both solutions are valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the context implies that there are pennies present, but even so, in both solutions, there are pennies.\n\nSo, it seems there are two possible combinations that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider if there are more solutions if I include more variables or consider different values, but based on my calculations, only q = 0 and q = 1 yield valid integer solutions for d, n, and p.\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations are:\n\n- 0 quarters, 2 dimes, 8 nickels, and 40 pennies\n\n- 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 2 nickels, and 45 pennies\n\nBoth of these combinations add up to 50 coins and $1.00.\n\nSo, to answer the question, there are two possible sets of coin counts that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThere are two possible combinations:\n\n1. 0 quarters, 2 dimes, 8 nickels, and 40 pennies\n\n2. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 2 nickels, and 45 pennies"
