        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature and also get some information about their notable works. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know who won the prize that year. I can probably find that through a quick web search. I'll use the DuckDuckGo search engine for this purpose because it's one of the tools available.\n\nSo, my first action is to perform a search using DuckDuckGo to find out the winner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nPlan: Use DuckDuckGo to search for the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner.\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner\"]\n\nOnce I have the name of the winner from the search results, I need to find out about their notable works. For that, I might need to visit some websites or look up information on their body of work.\n\nI can use the TextScraper tool to extract text from relevant web pages once I have the links. But first, I need to find the links that contain information about the author's works.\n\nPerhaps I can use the LinkFinder tool to extract links from the initial search results, and then use TextScraper on those links to get the text content.\n\nWait, maybe I can combine these steps. After getting the search results from DuckDuckGo, I can use LinkFinder to extract the relevant links, and then use TextScraper on those links to get the text content.\n\nThen, with the text content, I can ask InfoBot to summarize the notable works of the author.\n\nSo, here's how I can structure this:\n\n1. Use DuckDuckGo to search for the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner.\n\n2. Use LinkFinder to extract links from the search results.\n\n3. Use TextScraper to load the text content from those links.\n\n4. Use InfoBot to answer the question about the notable works, providing it with the text content from the previous step.\n\nLet me outline this in the required format.\n\nPlan: Search for the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner.\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner\"]\n\nPlan: Extract links from the search results.\n:evidence1: = LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Scrape the text content from the extracted links.\n:evidence2: = TextScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Use InfoBot to find out about the notable works of the winner, using the scraped text as context.\n:evidence3: = InfoBot[\"Who is the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner and what are some of their notable works?\" + \" Context: \" + :evidence2:]\n\nFinal Answer: :evidence3:\n\nBut wait, maybe I can make this more efficient. Perhaps I can have InfoBot directly answer the question by referencing the search results or the scraped text.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can have InfoBot look at the search results directly, but since it might not be able to process raw search results, it's better to scrape the text content first.\n\nI think the plan above makes sense. Let's stick with that.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\nPlan: Search for the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner.\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner\"]\n\nPlan: Extract links from the search results.\n:evidence1: = LinkFinder[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Scrape the text content from the extracted links.\n:evidence2: = TextScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Use InfoBot to find out about the notable works of the winner, using the scraped text as context.\n:evidence3: = InfoBot[\"Who is the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature winner and what are some of their notable works?\" + \" Context: \" + :evidence2:]\n\nFinal Answer: :evidence3:"
