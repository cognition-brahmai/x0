        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a telecom company upgrading its network. They're planning to install 500 new cell towers, each costing $100,000. They expect this upgrade will attract 200,000 new subscribers, and each of these new subscribers will bring in an extra $25 per month. I need to calculate the payback period for this investment, considering only the additional revenue from these new subscribers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a payback period is. The payback period is the time it takes for an investment to generate enough cash inflow to recover the initial investment. In this case, the initial investment is the cost of installing the new cell towers, and the cash inflow is the additional revenue from the new subscribers.\n\nSo, let's start by calculating the total initial investment. There are 500 towers, each costing $100,000.\n\nTotal investment = Number of towers \u00d7 Cost per tower\nTotal investment = 500 \u00d7 $100,000\nTotal investment = $50,000,000\n\nNext, I need to find out the additional monthly revenue from the new subscribers. There are 200,000 new subscribers, each generating an additional $25 per month.\n\nAdditional monthly revenue = Number of new subscribers \u00d7 Additional revenue per subscriber per month\nAdditional monthly revenue = 200,000 \u00d7 $25\nAdditional monthly revenue = $5,000,000 per month\n\nNow, to find the payback period, I need to divide the total investment by the additional monthly revenue and then convert it into years if necessary.\n\nPayback period (in months) = Total investment / Additional monthly revenue\nPayback period (in months) = $50,000,000 / $5,000,000 per month\nPayback period (in months) = 10 months\n\nIf we want to express this in years, we know there are 12 months in a year.\n\nPayback period (in years) = Payback period (in months) / 12\nPayback period (in years) = 10 / 12\nPayback period (in years) \u2248 0.833 years\n\nSo, the payback period for the network upgrade investment is 10 months or approximately 0.833 years.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this. The company is spending $50 million up front to install these towers, and they're getting an extra $5 million per month from the new subscribers. So, yes, dividing $50 million by $5 million per month gives 10 months. That seems correct.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other costs involved, like operating costs for the towers, but the problem specifies to consider only the additional revenue generated by the new subscribers. So, I don't need to factor in any other expenses for this calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the additional revenue is guaranteed. The company expects to attract 200,000 new subscribers, but there might be a chance that they don't reach that number. However, since the question is based on their expectations, I'll proceed with the given numbers.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"increased data usage by customers,\" but it doesn't specify if there are any additional costs related to handling increased data traffic, such as upgraded backend systems or higher bandwidth costs. Again, since the instruction is to consider only the additional revenue from new subscribers, I won't include any other costs.\n\nIt's important to note that in real-world scenarios, companies would consider a more comprehensive financial analysis, including operating costs, maintenance, and the time value of money. But for this exercise, we're focusing solely on the payback period based on the initial investment and the additional revenue from new subscribers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the payback period for the network upgrade investment is 10 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ months}} \\]"
