        "content": "Well, I'm not a Star Wars expert, but I do know a thing or two about the franchise. One fact that might be known only to die-hard Star Wars fans is that the character of Yoda was originally conceived as a small, wise alien who lived on Dagobah and trained Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force. However, in early drafts of The Empire Strikes Back, Yoda was supposed to be a very different character\u2014more of a kindly, grandfatherly figure who lived in a treehouse. It was only through the vision of George Lucas and the input of the filmmakers that Yoda evolved into the green, wise being we know today.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that the iconic phrase \"May the Force be with you\" was almost \"May the Maker be with you,\" referring to the Maker, a concept from the original Star Wars script that was later replaced with the Force.\n\nI hope that gives you a little glimpse into the depth of Star Wars lore!"
