        "content": "Let's see what's going on here. So, the farmer has corn plants that are growing at an increasing rate each week. In the first week, they grew by 2 inches, and in the second week, they grew by 4 inches. The pattern seems to be that each week, the growth doubles from the previous week. So, week 1: 2 inches, week 2: 4 inches, and so on.\n\nIf this pattern continues, we need to find out how much the plants will have grown in total after 8 weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the pattern clearly. It looks like each week's growth is double the previous week's growth.\n\nSo, let's list out the growth for each week:\n\n- Week 1: 2 inches\n\n- Week 2: 4 inches (2 * 2)\n\n- Week 3: 8 inches (4 * 2)\n\n- Week 4: 16 inches (8 * 2)\n\n- Week 5: 32 inches (16 * 2)\n\n- Week 6: 64 inches (32 * 2)\n\n- Week 7: 128 inches (64 * 2)\n\n- Week 8: 256 inches (128 * 2)\n\nNow, to find the total growth after 8 weeks, I need to add up all these weekly growth amounts.\n\nSo, total growth = Week 1 + Week 2 + Week 3 + Week 4 + Week 5 + Week 6 + Week 7 + Week 8\n\nThat is: 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256\n\nLet me add these step by step:\n\n2 + 4 = 6\n\n6 + 8 = 14\n\n14 + 16 = 30\n\n30 + 32 = 62\n\n62 + 64 = 126\n\n126 + 128 = 254\n\n254 + 256 = 510\n\nSo, the total growth after 8 weeks is 510 inches.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? The growth is doubling each week, which leads to exponential increase. So, the total growth should be substantial, as we've calculated.\n\nAlternatively, I know that this is a geometric series, where each term is double the previous one, starting from 2 inches.\n\nIn a geometric series, the sum S of the first n terms is given by:\n\nS = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this case:\n\n- a = 2 inches\n\n- r = 2 (since each week's growth is double the previous week's)\n\n- n = 8 weeks\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nS = 2 * (2^8 - 1) / (2 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 2^8:\n\n2^8 = 256\n\nSo:\n\nS = 2 * (256 - 1) / 1\n\nS = 2 * 255 / 1\n\nS = 2 * 255\n\nS = 510 inches\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total growth of the corn plants after 8 weeks is 510 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{510} \\]"
