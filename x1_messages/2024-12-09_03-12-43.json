        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing sports. There are 20 students in total. Out of these, 12 play basketball, 8 play soccer, and 5 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nOkay, let me try to wrap my head around this. I think it's a problem about sets and maybe using something like a Venn diagram could help visualize it.\n\nSo, if I have a group of 20 students, and some play basketball, some play soccer, and some play both, I need to find out how many don't play any sport.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play any sport.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Total students = 20\n\n- Students who play basketball = 12\n\n- Students who play soccer = 8\n\n- Students who play both basketball and soccer = 5\n\nNow, if I just add the number of students who play basketball and the number who play soccer, that would be 12 + 8 = 20. But wait, that's the same as the total number of students. Does that mean that all students play at least one sport? But no, because some play both, and if I just add 12 and 8, I'm double-counting those who play both.\n\nSo, to find the number of students who play at least one sport, I need to add the number who play basketball and the number who play soccer, and then subtract the number who play both, so I don't double-count them.\n\nSo, number of students who play at least one sport = (students who play basketball) + (students who play soccer) - (students who play both).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 12 + 8 - 5 = 15.\n\nSo, 15 students play at least one sport.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play any sport, I subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nThat would be: total students - students who play at least one sport = 20 - 15 = 5.\n\nTherefore, 5 students do not play either sport.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should try another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion says that to find the total number of elements in the union of two sets, you add the sizes of the individual sets and subtract the size of their intersection.\n\nIn this case, the two sets are students who play basketball and students who play soccer.\n\nSo, the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\n|Basketball \u222a Soccer| = |Basketball| + |Soccer| - |Basketball \u2229 Soccer|\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|Basketball \u222a Soccer| = 12 + 8 - 5 = 15.\n\nAgain, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play any sport, I subtract that from the total number of students:\n\n20 - 15 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total students: U (universe)\n\n- Students who play basketball: B\n\n- Students who play soccer: S\n\nThen, the number of students who play at least one sport is |B \u222a S|, which we've already calculated as 15.\n\nThe number of students who don't play any sport is the complement of |B \u222a S| with respect to U, which is |U - (B \u222a S)| = |U| - |B \u222a S| = 20 - 15 = 5.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the students who play only basketball, only soccer, and both, and then see how many are left who don't play any sport.\n\nSo, students who play only basketball: 12 (total basketball) - 5 (both) = 7.\n\nStudents who play only soccer: 8 (total soccer) - 5 (both) = 3.\n\nStudents who play both: 5.\n\nSo, total students who play at least one sport: 7 (only basketball) + 3 (only soccer) + 5 (both) = 15.\n\nAgain, that matches what I have.\n\nTherefore, students who don't play any sport: 20 - 15 = 5.\n\nI think this makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try using a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents basketball players, and the other represents soccer players.\n\n- The overlap (both sports) has 5 students.\n\n- Only basketball: 12 total basketball - 5 both = 7.\n\n- Only soccer: 8 total soccer - 5 both = 3.\n\nSo, in the Venn diagram:\n\n- Only basketball: 7 students.\n\n- Only soccer: 3 students.\n\n- Both sports: 5 students.\n\nTotal in the Venn diagram: 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 students.\n\nTotal students: 20.\n\nTherefore, students not in the Venn diagram (not playing any sport): 20 - 15 = 5.\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the students who play basketball and those who play soccer, and account for the overlap, I still get the same result.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps using probabilities or other set theory concepts, but I think for this problem, the approach I've taken is sufficient and accurate.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning, and multiple methods lead to the same answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5 students do not play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
