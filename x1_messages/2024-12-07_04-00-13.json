        "content": "So you've got a water tank that can hold 500 gallons, and a faucet that fills it up at 10 gallons per minute. You want to know how long it'll take to fill the tank completely, right?\n\nWell, to figure this out, you can think of it as a simple division problem. You've got 500 gallons to fill, and each minute, the faucet adds 10 gallons. So, you just need to divide the total capacity of the tank by the rate at which the faucet fills it.\n\nThat is:\n\nTime (in minutes) = Total gallons / Gallons per minute\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 500 gallons / 10 gallons per minute\n\nWhen you do the division, you get:\n\nTime = 50 minutes\n\nSo, it would take 50 minutes to fill the tank completely at that rate.\n\nBut let's double-check that. If the faucet adds 10 gallons every minute, after 50 minutes, it would have added:\n\n10 gallons/minute * 50 minutes = 500 gallons\n\nWhich matches the tank's capacity. So, yeah, 50 minutes is correct.\n\nNow, what if there was a small leak in the tank that was losing, say, 2 gallons per minute? How would that affect the filling time?\n\nWell, in that case, you'd have to account for both the water being added and the water being lost. So, the effective filling rate would be the filling rate minus the leaking rate.\n\nEffective rate = Filling rate - Leaking rate\n\n= 10 gallons per minute - 2 gallons per minute\n\n= 8 gallons per minute\n\nThen, the time to fill the tank would be:\n\nTime = Total gallons / Effective rate\n\n= 500 gallons / 8 gallons per minute\n\n= 62.5 minutes\n\nSo, with a leak of 2 gallons per minute, it would take 62.5 minutes to fill the tank.\n\nBut in your original question, there's no mention of a leak, so we can stick with the initial calculation of 50 minutes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the unit rates. The faucet fills at 10 gallons per minute, so to fill 500 gallons, you can set up a proportion:\n\n10 gallons / 1 minute = 500 gallons / x minutes\n\nThen, solve for x:\n\nx = (500 gallons * 1 minute) / 10 gallons\n\nx = 50 minutes\n\nSame answer again.\n\nThis kind of problem is a basic example of rate problems, where you have a constant rate of change (in this case, filling rate), and you need to find out how long it takes to reach a certain quantity.\n\nThese types of problems are fundamental in many areas, including physics, engineering, and everyday life.\n\nFor example, if you're filling a swimming pool, calculating how long it will take based on the flow rate of your hose is similar to this problem.\n\nOr, in cooking, if a recipe calls for adding water at a certain rate, you might need to calculate how much time it will take to reach the desired volume.\n\nUnderstanding these basic principles can be really helpful in lots of practical situations.\n\nSo, in summary, for your specific question, it will take 50 minutes to fill a 500-gallon tank with a faucet that fills at 10 gallons per minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
