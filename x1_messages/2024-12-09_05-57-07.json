Every plan should correlate to an evidence value, which would be the output of one of the accessible functions given an input string. This could be the user's question, prior evidence values, or a blend of both.\n\nTools available:\nYahooSearch[input]: Allows users to seek information through Yahoo Search. It aids in identifying possible sites that may contain responses to the user's question. It does not offer direct answers but compiles a list of sites that might possess the answer.\nPageLoader[input]: Takes one or more websites from an input string comprising newline-separated links. The input includes one or more links, and the output provides the plain text content of these links.\nURLGatherer[input]: Collects links from plain text and returns a plain text, newline-separated compilation of links.\nQuerySolver[input]: An AI-based question-solving model proficient in supplying answers derived from a specified text passage. The input needs to be a text question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, such as 'Who wrote Pride and Prejudice, given :evidence1:'?\n\nEach function's inputs should be simple strings, devoid of quotation marks or '+' symbols used to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, like QuerySolver[Who directed Titanic, given :evidence3:?].\n\nMake sure to incorporate only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should adhere to this format:\nPlan: [First action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to invoke with input parameter]\nPlan: [Following action based on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Subsequent function to invoke with input parameter, possibly referring to earlier evidence, i.e., 'Given context :evidence0']\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the definitive answer.]\n\nQuestion: How has climate change affected the Great Barrier Reef over the past decade?"
