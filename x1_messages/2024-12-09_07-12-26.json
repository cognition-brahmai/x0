        "content": "You're thinking of pizza! It's one of Italy's most famous contributions to global cuisine. Pizza typically starts with a yeast-based dough that's flattened into a round shape. The toppings can vary widely, but classic options include mozzarella cheese, fresh tomatoes, basil, and sometimes meats like pepperoni or ham. It's then baked in an oven, often at high temperatures, to achieve that crispy crust and melted cheese. Pizza is not only delicious but also incredibly versatile, which is part of why it's so popular worldwide."
