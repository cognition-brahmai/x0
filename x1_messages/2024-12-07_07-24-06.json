        "content": "So I've got this question here: If an ant can carry 50 times its own weight, and the ant weighs 2 milligrams, how much weight can the ant carry? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. The question is about an ant's strength in relation to its own weight. It says the ant can carry 50 times its own weight, and it weighs 2 milligrams. So, I need to find out how much weight it can carry.\n\nI think this is a straightforward multiplication problem. If the ant can carry 50 times its own weight, I just need to multiply the ant's weight by 50 to find out how much it can carry.\n\nSo, the ant's weight is 2 milligrams. Times 50 would be:\n\n2 milligrams * 50 = 100 milligrams\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider the units or see if there's any conversion needed. The question is using milligrams, and since the answer is also in milligrams, I think that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of dimensions. Weight is being multiplied by a dimensionless number (50 times), so the units remain the same.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using proportions or something more complex, but I don't think that's necessary here. It's a direct multiplication problem.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up an equation. Let\u2019s let the ant's weight be W, which is 2 milligrams, and the carrying capacity be C, which is 50 times W.\n\nSo, C = 50 * W\n\nPlugging in the value:\n\nC = 50 * 2 milligrams = 100 milligrams\n\nThat seems consistent with my initial calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider the units. A milligram is a unit of mass, and since we're multiplying it by a pure number (50), the units don't change. So, 2 milligrams times 50 equals 100 milligrams.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other factor to consider, like the ant's strength or something else, but the question seems to provide all the necessary information directly. It states that the ant can carry 50 times its own weight, so I don't need to account for anything else.\n\nLet me also consider if the answer makes sense. An ant weighing 2 milligrams being able to carry 100 milligrams seems plausible because ants are known for their strength relative to their size.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the ant can carry 100 milligrams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ milligrams}} \\]"
