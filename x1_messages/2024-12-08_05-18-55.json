Maybe they still plan to drive 500 miles on the third day, or maybe they adjust their plan.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems that on the third day, they still drive the planned 500 miles.\n\nSo, following that, they would have driven:\n\nDay 1: 500 miles\n\nDay 2: 400 miles\n\nDay 3: 500 miles\n\nTotal so far: 500 + 400 + 500 = 1400 miles\n\nOriginal plan: 2000 miles\n\nSo, on the fourth day, they need to drive:\n\n2000 - 1400 = 600 miles\n\nTherefore, they need to drive an additional 100 miles on the fourth day compared to their original plan of 500 miles.\n\nWait, but the question is: \"How many more miles do they need to drive on the fourth day to complete their original plan?\"\n\nThey originally planned to drive 500 miles on each day, including the fourth day. But because they only drove 400 miles on the second day, they have a deficit of 100 miles.\n\nTo make up for that deficit, they need to drive an extra 100 miles on the fourth day, in addition to the original 500 miles.\n\nSo, total on the fourth day, they need to drive 500 + 100 = 600 miles.\n\nTherefore, they need to drive 100 miles more on the fourth day than they originally planned.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total miles driven after three days and see how much is left to reach the original total.\n\nOriginal total: 500 miles/day \u00d7 4 days = 2000 miles\n\nMiles driven:\n\nDay 1: 500 miles\n\nDay 2: 400 miles\n\nDay 3: 500 miles\n\nTotal after three days: 500 + 400 + 500 = 1400 miles\n\nRemaining miles to reach 2000: 2000 - 1400 = 600 miles\n\nSo, on the fourth day, they need to drive 600 miles.\n\nSince their original plan was to drive 500 miles on the fourth day, they need to drive an additional 100 miles on that day.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that they need to drive 100 more miles on the fourth day to complete their original plan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
