        "content": "I've heard that too, but it's actually a myth. Daddy longlegs, also known as harvestmen, aren't even true spiders. They belong to a different order called Opiliones. Unlike spiders, which have two main body parts and eight legs, harvestmen have one main body part and eight legs. They don't have venom or fangs like spiders do. So, they can't bite or inject venom into humans. The myth might have started because some people confuse harvestmen with another type of spider called the cranberry spider, which is a cellar spider that also has long legs but is not venomous to humans either. So, in short, daddy longlegs aren't venomous, and they can't bite us even if they wanted to!"
