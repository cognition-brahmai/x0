        "content": "Sure! The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, but it's most notably used for credit card numbers. It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn. The algorithm is designed to protect against accidental errors, such as transposed digits, and can detect about 90% of all possible single-digit errors.\n\nHere's how the Luhn algorithm works:\n\n1. **Starting from the rightmost digit (the check digit)**, double every second digit moving left. For example, if the number is 1234567812345670, you would double 7, 5, 3, 1, 8, 6, 4, and 2.\n\n2. **If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9** (e.g., 8*2=16), then add the digits of the product (e.g., 1+6=7).\n\n3. **Sum all the digits** together.\n\n4. **If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0** (i.e., the total ends with a zero), then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nNow, let's design a JavaScript function to implement this algorithm.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm in JavaScript, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check if the input is a string of digits:** Ensure the input is a string consisting only of digits.\n\n2. **Double every second digit from the right:** Start from the rightmost digit and double every second digit moving to the left.\n\n3. **Handle numbers greater than 9:** If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9, sum the digits of the product.\n\n4. **Sum all the digits:** Add up all the digits of the modified number.\n\n5. **Check if the sum is a multiple of 10:** If the total sum is divisible by 10, the number is valid.\n\nHere is the JavaScript function that implements the above steps:\n\n```javascript\nfunction validateCreditCardNumber(cardNumber) {\n    // Check if input is a string of digits\n    if (typeof cardNumber !== 'string' || !/^\\d+$/.test(cardNumber)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    let sum = 0;\n    let double = false;\n\n    // Process each digit from the right\n    for (let i = cardNumber.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        let digit = parseInt(cardNumber[i], 10);\n\n        if (double) {\n            digit *= 2;\n            if (digit > 9) {\n                digit = digit - 9;\n            }\n        }\n\n        sum += digit;\n        double = !double;\n    }\n\n    // Check if sum is divisible by 10\n    return sum % 10 === 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Validation:** The function first checks if the input is a string consisting only of digits. If not, it immediately returns `false`.\n\n2. **Processing Digits:** It initializes a sum to zero and a flag `double` to keep track of whether to double the digit.\n\n3. **Doubling Every Second Digit:** Starting from the rightmost digit, it doubles every second digit. If the result is greater than 9, it subtracts 9 to get the sum of the digits (since 10-9=1, 11-9=2, etc.).\n\n4. **Summing Digits:** It adds up all the processed digits.\n\n5. **Validation Check:** Finally, it checks if the total sum is divisible by 10. If it is, the card number is valid; otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nThis function provides a straightforward way to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm in JavaScript."
