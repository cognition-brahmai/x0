        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses on a street, and they follow a specific color pattern: the first house is red, the second is blue, and the third is green. This pattern continues for all 10 houses. I need to find out what color the ninth house is.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the pattern. It seems like the houses are being colored in a repeating sequence of red, blue, green. So, house 1 is red, house 2 is blue, house 3 is green, and then it repeats: house 4 is red, house 5 is blue, and so on.\n\nTo find the color of the ninth house, I can divide the house numbers by the length of the pattern sequence, which is 3, and see what the remainder is.\n\nSo, 9 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 0. Wait, that seems a bit off because usually, if the remainder is 0, it means it's the last color in the sequence. But let's confirm.\n\nLet me list out the colors for each house to verify:\n\n- House 1: red\n\n- House 2: blue\n\n- House 3: green\n\n- House 4: red\n\n- House 5: blue\n\n- House 6: green\n\n- House 7: red\n\n- House 8: blue\n\n- House 9: green\n\nOkay, so according to this list, the ninth house is green.\n\nAlternatively, using the division method:\n\nFor any house number n, the color can be determined by finding the remainder when n is divided by 3.\n\n- If the remainder is 1, it's red.\n\n- If the remainder is 2, it's blue.\n\n- If the remainder is 0, it's green.\n\nSo, for house 9: 9 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 0, which corresponds to green.\n\nThis matches the list I made earlier.\n\nTherefore, the ninth house is green.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{green}} \\]"
