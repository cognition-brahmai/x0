        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 500 units of product A in the first month, and then it increases production by 10% each subsequent month. We need to find out how many total units will be produced after one year.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. A year has 12 months, so we need to calculate the production for each month and then sum them all up.\n\nGiven that the production increases by 10% each month, this sounds like a geometric sequence where each term is 10% greater than the previous one.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. In this case, the common ratio is 1.10 (since a 10% increase means multiplying by 1.10).\n\nSo, the production in the first month is 500 units.\n\nIn the second month, it's 500 * 1.10.\n\nIn the third month, it's (500 * 1.10) * 1.10 = 500 * (1.10)^2.\n\nAnd this pattern continues up to the 12th month, which would be 500 * (1.10)^11.\n\nTo find the total production over 12 months, we need to sum up all these terms.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere:\n\n- a is the first term (500 units),\n\n- r is the common ratio (1.10),\n\n- n is the number of terms (12 months).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 500 * (1 - (1.10)^12) / (1 - 1.10)\n\nFirst, calculate (1.10)^12.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n1.10^12 is approximately 3.1384283767.\n\nSo, S = 500 * (1 - 3.1384283767) / (1 - 1.10)\n\n= 500 * (-2.1384283767) / (-0.10)\n\nNow, negative signs will cancel out.\n\nSo, S = 500 * 2.1384283767 / 0.10\n\n= 500 * 21.384283767\n\n= 10,692.1418835\n\nSince we're dealing with units of production, which are typically whole numbers, we can round this to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, the total production after one year is approximately 10,692 units.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, confirm the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, a = 500, r = 1.10, n = 12.\n\nCalculate (1.10)^12 again.\n\n1.10^12 is indeed approximately 3.1384283767.\n\nThen, 1 - 3.1384283767 = -2.1384283767\n\nDenominator: 1 - 1.10 = -0.10\n\nSo, S = 500 * (-2.1384283767) / (-0.10) = 500 * 21.384283767 = 10,692.1418835\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the formula is written as:\n\nS = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhich would give the same result, since the negative signs cancel out.\n\nSo, the total production after one year is approximately 10,692 units.\n\nBut to be precise, let's consider more decimal places to avoid rounding errors.\n\nLet me calculate (1.10)^12 more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.10^12 = 3.138428376721000.\n\nSo, S = 500 * (1 - 3.138428376721000) / (1 - 1.10)\n\n= 500 * (-2.138428376721000) / (-0.10)\n\n= 500 * 21.38428376721000\n\n= 10,692.141883605003\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 10,692 units.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that production increases each month based on the previous month's production, we can calculate the production for each month individually and sum them up.\n\nLet's try that to verify.\n\nMonth 1: 500 units\n\nMonth 2: 500 * 1.10 = 550 units\n\nMonth 3: 550 * 1.10 = 605 units\n\nMonth 4: 605 * 1.10 = 665.5 units\n\nMonth 5: 665.5 * 1.10 = 732.05 units\n\nMonth 6: 732.05 * 1.10 = 805.255 units\n\nMonth 7: 805.255 * 1.10 = 885.7805 units\n\nMonth 8: 885.7805 * 1.10 = 974.35855 units\n\nMonth 9: 974.35855 * 1.10 = 1,071.794405 units\n\nMonth 10: 1,071.794405 * 1.10 = 1,178.9738455 units\n\nMonth 11: 1,178.9738455 * 1.10 = 1,296.87123005 units\n\nMonth 12: 1,296.87123005 * 1.10 = 1,426.558353055 units\n\nNow, sum all these up:\n\n500 + 550 = 1,050\n\n1,050 + 605 = 1,655\n\n1,655 + 665.5 = 2,320.5\n\n2,320.5 + 732.05 = 3,052.55\n\n3,052.55 + 805.255 = 3,857.805\n\n3,857.805 + 885.7805 = 4,743.5855\n\n4,743.5855 + 974.35855 = 5,717.94405\n\n5,717.94405 + 1,071.794405 = 6,789.738455\n\n6,789.738455 + 1,178.9738455 = 7,968.7123005\n\n7,968.7123005 + 1,296.87123005 = 9,265.58353055\n\n9,265.58353055 + 1,426.558353055 = 10,692.141883605\n\nAgain, we get approximately 10,692.141883605 units, which rounds to 10,692 units.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, confirming that our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total units produced after one year are 10,692.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nFor example, does the 10% increase apply at the end of each month, or is it compounded differently?\n\nGiven the problem states \"increases production by 10% each subsequent month,\" it's most straightforward to interpret this as a monthly multiplication by 1.10.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each month's production is 1.10 times the previous month's production.\n\nSo, the sequence is indeed geometric with a common ratio of 1.10.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 500 * (1.10^12 - 1) / (1.10 - 1)\n\n= 500 * (3.138428376721000 - 1) / 0.10\n\n= 500 * 2.138428376721000 / 0.10\n\n= 500 * 21.38428376721000\n\n= 10,692.141883605\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest whole number, 10,692 units.\n\nSo, regardless of the method used, the total production after one year is approximately 10,692 units.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in real-world scenarios, production quantities are typically whole numbers, so rounding to the nearest whole number is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce a total of 10,692 units of product A after one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10692} \\]"
