It was first published in 1935, and in the standard U.S. version, the most expensive property is Boardwalk, which is indeed named after a street in Atlantic City. Atlantic City is famous for its boardwalk, so it makes sense that it would be the priciest property on the board. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Monopoly or board games in general?"
