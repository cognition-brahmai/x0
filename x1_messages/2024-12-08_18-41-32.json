        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 120 cars in total, and they rent out 75% of them. I need to find out how many cars are still available for rent.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars are rented out. To do that, I can calculate 75% of 120. I know that 75% is the same as 75/100 or 0.75 in decimal form. So, I can multiply 120 by 0.75 to find the number of rented cars.\n\nLet me do the math: 120 multiplied by 0.75. That's 120 times 75, which is 9000, and since 75 is two decimal places, but actually, 0.75 is two decimal places, so 120 times 0.75 is 90. So, 90 cars are rented out.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are still available, I need to subtract the number of rented cars from the total number of cars. That is, 120 minus 90.\n\n120 minus 90 is 30.\n\nSo, there are 30 cars still available for rent.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe instead of finding the number of rented cars and then subtracting, I could directly find the percentage of cars that are available.\n\nSince 75% are rented, that means 100% minus 75% are available, which is 25%. So, I could find 25% of 120 to get the number of available cars.\n\nLet me try that. 25% of 120. Again, 25% is 0.25 in decimal form. So, 120 times 0.25.\n\n120 times 0.25. Well, 120 times 25 is 3000, and since 25 is two decimal places, but 0.25 is two decimal places, so 120 times 0.25 is 30.\n\nSo, again, I get 30 cars available.\n\nThat's good, both methods give me the same answer. So, I can be confident that 30 is the correct number of cars still available for rent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
