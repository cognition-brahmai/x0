        "content": "So, let's see here. There's a train traveling between City A and City B, and the distance between them is 300 miles. The train takes 3 hours to make that journey. There's also a passenger who needs to get from their home in City A to the train station, and that takes an additional hour. The question is, how long does it take for the passenger to travel from their home in City A to City B?\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the parts of this problem. The train travels 300 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is constant. I can calculate the speed if needed, but maybe it's not necessary for this problem.\n\nThe passenger has to get from their home to the train station in City A, which takes an additional hour. Then, they board the train and travel to City B.\n\nSo, the total time for the passenger would be the time to get to the train station plus the time the train takes to reach City B.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal time = time from home to train station + time from train station in City A to City B\n\nGiven that time from home to train station is 1 hour, and time from train station in City A to City B is 3 hours, total time should be 1 + 3 = 4 hours.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are other factors involved, like waiting time for the train or something. But the problem doesn't mention any waiting time, so perhaps it's straightforward.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n\"A train travels at a constant speed between two cities, City A and City B. The distance between the cities is 300 miles. If the train takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B, and it takes an additional hour for a passenger to get from their home in City A to the train station, how long does it take for the passenger to travel from their home in City A to City B?\"\n\nSo, it seems straightforward. The passenger has to do two things:\n\n1. Get from home to the train station in City A, which takes 1 hour.\n\n2. Travel from City A to City B by train, which takes 3 hours.\n\nTotal time is the sum of these two times.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the speed of the train or something else. Let's see.\n\nThe train's speed is constant, and it covers 300 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is 100 miles per hour. But I don't think that's relevant for calculating the total time for the passenger.\n\nUnless there's something about the passenger's mode of transportation to the train station. The problem doesn't specify how the passenger gets to the train station, just that it takes an additional hour.\n\nSo, assuming there are no other delays or times involved, the total time should indeed be 4 hours.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the passenger has to wait for the train after arriving at the station. But the problem doesn't mention any waiting time, so I'll assume that the passenger can board the train immediately upon arriving at the station.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"additional hour\" includes any waiting time, but again, the problem doesn't specify.\n\nGiven the information provided, the total time for the passenger to travel from home in City A to City B is 1 hour (home to station) plus 3 hours (station in City A to City B), totaling 4 hours.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
