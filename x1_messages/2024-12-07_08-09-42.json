        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 5(2x - 3) - 4(x + 1) = 9. Hmm, okay, let's see. First, I need to simplify the left side of the equation before I can solve for x. I think I should start by distributing the 5 and the -4 into the parentheses.\n\nSo, 5 times (2x - 3) would be 5*2x which is 10x, and 5*(-3) which is -15. So that gives me 10x - 15.\n\nThen, -4 times (x + 1) would be -4*x which is -4x, and -4*1 which is -4. So that's -4x - 4.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the left side of the equation is 10x - 15 - 4x - 4. I need to combine like terms here. So, 10x - 4x is 6x, and -15 - 4 is -19. So now the equation looks like 6x - 19 = 9.\n\nAlright, next step is to isolate the x term. I think I'll add 19 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -19 on the left side. So, 6x - 19 + 19 equals 6x, and 9 + 19 equals 28. Now the equation is 6x = 28.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 6. So, x = 28/6. I can simplify that fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, which gives me x = 14/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:\n\n5(2x - 3) - 4(x + 1) = 9\n\nDistribute:\n\n5*2x = 10x\n\n5*(-3) = -15\n\n-4*x = -4x\n\n-4*1 = -4\n\nSo, 10x - 15 - 4x - 4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10x - 4x = 6x\n\n-15 - 4 = -19\n\nSo, 6x - 19 = 9\n\nAdd 19 to both sides:\n\n6x - 19 + 19 = 6x\n\n9 + 19 = 28\n\nSo, 6x = 28\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nx = 28/6 = 14/3\n\nSeems correct. But just to be sure, I'll plug x = 14/3 back into the original equation to verify.\n\nOriginal equation: 5(2x - 3) - 4(x + 1) = 9\n\nPlug in x = 14/3:\n\n5(2*(14/3) - 3) - 4((14/3) + 1) = ?\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n2*(14/3) = 28/3\n\n28/3 - 3 = 28/3 - 9/3 = 19/3\n\nSo, 5*(19/3) = 95/3\n\nNext, (14/3) + 1 = 14/3 + 3/3 = 17/3\n\nThen, -4*(17/3) = -68/3\n\nNow, 95/3 - 68/3 = (95 - 68)/3 = 27/3 = 9\n\nYes, that equals 9, which matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 14/3 is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}} \\]"
