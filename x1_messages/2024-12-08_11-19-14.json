        "content": "To prove that the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2 is continuous at x = 1, we need to show that the following three conditions are met:\n\n1. f(1) is defined.\n\n2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 exists.\n\n3. The limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 is equal to f(1).\n\nLet's go through each condition step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Check if f(1) is defined.**\n\nFirst, we need to evaluate the function at x = 1.\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 3*(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0\n\nSo, f(1) is defined and equals 0.\n\n**Step 2: Check if the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 exists.**\n\nTo determine if the limit exists, we need to check if the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are equal.\n\nSince f(x) is a polynomial function, it is continuous everywhere in its domain, which is all real numbers. Polynomial functions are continuous on their entire domain, meaning that the limit of f(x) as x approaches any real number a is equal to f(a).\n\nTherefore, the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 is f(1) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the limit directly:\n\nlim (x\u21921) [x^3 - 3x + 2]\n\n= (lim x\u21921 x^3) - 3*(lim x\u21921 x) + lim x\u21921 2\n\n= (1)^3 - 3*(1) + 2\n\n= 1 - 3 + 2\n\n= 0\n\nSo, the limit exists and is equal to 0.\n\n**Step 3: Check if the limit equals f(1).**\n\nFrom step 1, f(1) = 0.\n\nFrom step 2, lim (x\u21921) f(x) = 0.\n\nSince the limit equals f(1), the function is continuous at x = 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe function f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2 is continuous at x = 1 because all three conditions of continuity are satisfied.\n\n**Additional Note:**\n\nIt's worth noting that polynomial functions are continuous on the entire set of real numbers, so any polynomial function is continuous at every real number without needing to check the three conditions individually. However, in this case, we have gone through the steps to demonstrate the process explicitly."
