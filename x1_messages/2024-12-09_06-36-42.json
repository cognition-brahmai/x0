        "content": "So, there are 7 days in a week, and you want to know how many weeks there are in 365 days. Alright, let's figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 365 days, and we want to know how many full weeks are in that period. Since a week has 7 days, I think I need to divide 365 by 7. That should give me the number of weeks.\n\nSo, let's do the division. 365 divided by 7. Hmm, I'm not sure what that equals off the top of my head, so I'll have to calculate it.\n\nLet me try: 7 times 50 is 350. Subtract 350 from 365, and that leaves me with 15 days. Now, 7 goes into 15 twice, because 7 times 2 is 14. Subtract 14 from 15, and I have 1 day left over.\n\nSo, that means there are 50 weeks plus 2 weeks, making 52 weeks, and then 1 extra day.\n\nWait a minute, let's check that again. 7 times 52 is 364, because 7 times 50 is 350, and 7 times 2 is 14, so 350 plus 14 is 364. Then, 365 minus 364 is 1 day.\n\nSo, in 365 days, there are 52 weeks and 1 day.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many weeks there are in 365 days. So, the answer is 52 weeks, with 1 extra day.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to express it in decimal form, you could say that 365 divided by 7 is approximately 52.142857 weeks. But since we're dealing with days, it's probably more precise to say 52 weeks and 1 day.\n\nLet me confirm this. If I multiply 52 weeks by 7 days, that's 364 days, and then add the extra day, it totals 365 days. That seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, there are 52 weeks in 365 days, with 1 extra day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52} \\]"
