        "content": "Let's see. Sarah is older than her brother Tom by 5 years, and together their ages add up to 45 years. I need to find out how old Sarah was when Tom was born.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out their current ages. Let's use some algebra for this. Let's say Tom's current age is T years, and Sarah's current age is S years.\n\nFrom the information given:\n\n1. Sarah is older than Tom by 5 years: S = T + 5\n\n2. Their combined age is 45: S + T = 45\n\nNow, I can substitute the first equation into the second one:\n\n(T + 5) + T = 45\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n2T + 5 = 45\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n2T = 40\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nT = 20\n\nSo, Tom is currently 20 years old. Now, since Sarah is 5 years older than Tom, S = 20 + 5 = 25 years old.\n\nNow, to find out how old Sarah was when Tom was born, I need to think about the age difference between them. Since Sarah is 5 years older than Tom, that means she was 5 years old when Tom was born.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. When Tom was born, Sarah was already 5 years old, because she is 5 years older than him. So, yes, Sarah was 5 years old when Tom was born.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another way to interpret this. The age difference between them is constant over time. So, regardless of their current ages, the difference remains 5 years.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the time when Tom was born. At that time, Tom was 0 years old, and Sarah was 5 years older than him, so she was 5 years old.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved, like the passage of time or something, but I think that's unnecessary here.\n\nSo, my final answer is that Sarah was 5 years old when Tom was born.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
