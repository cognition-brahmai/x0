        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system by adding electric buses to replace half of its existing diesel buses. Currently, there are 100 diesel buses, each carrying 50 passengers. They plan to replace half of these with electric buses over five years. Each electric bus costs $500,000 and can hold up to 60 passengers. Also, there's a 30% government subsidy for each electric bus purchased. I need to calculate the total cost of this project and the increased passenger capacity after the transition.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many buses are being replaced. Half of 100 is 50, so they're replacing 50 diesel buses with electric ones.\n\nNext, each electric bus costs $500,000, so without any subsidies, the total cost would be 50 buses times $500,000 each. That's 50 * 500,000 = $25,000,000.\n\nBut there's a 30% government subsidy for each electric bus. So, the city only has to pay 70% of the cost for each bus. Let's calculate the subsidized cost per bus: 70% of $500,000 is 0.7 * 500,000 = $350,000 per bus.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 50 electric buses with subsidy is 50 * 350,000 = $17,500,000.\n\nNow, let's look at the passenger capacity before and after the transition.\n\nCurrently, there are 100 diesel buses, each carrying 50 passengers. So, total passenger capacity is 100 * 50 = 5,000 passengers.\n\nAfter replacing 50 diesel buses with electric ones, there will be:\n\n- 50 diesel buses left, each with 50 passengers: 50 * 50 = 2,500 passengers.\n\n- 50 electric buses, each with 60 passengers: 50 * 60 = 3,000 passengers.\n\nSo, the new total passenger capacity is 2,500 + 3,000 = 5,500 passengers.\n\nTherefore, the increased passenger capacity is 5,500 - 5,000 = 500 passengers.\n\nIn summary, the total cost of the project is $17,500,000, and the increased passenger capacity is 500 passengers.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the number of buses being replaced: half of 100 is indeed 50.\n\nCost per electric bus: $500,000.\n\nSubsidy is 30%, so the city pays 70% of the cost: 0.7 * 500,000 = $350,000 per bus.\n\nTotal cost for 50 buses: 50 * 350,000 = $17,500,000. That seems correct.\n\nNow, passenger capacity:\n\nBefore: 100 buses * 50 passengers = 5,000 passengers.\n\nAfter: 50 diesel buses * 50 passengers = 2,500 passengers.\n\nPlus 50 electric buses * 60 passengers = 3,000 passengers.\n\nTotal: 2,500 + 3,000 = 5,500 passengers.\n\nIncrease: 5,500 - 5,000 = 500 passengers. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if they replace more buses, would the passenger capacity increase more? But in this case, they're only replacing half, so this seems accurate.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other costs involved, like infrastructure for electric buses, such as charging stations. But the problem doesn't mention any additional costs beyond the bus purchases, so I'll assume that's all that's required for this calculation.\n\nSo, final answer: total cost is $17,500,000, and increased passenger capacity is 500 passengers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17,500,000 \\text{ dollars and } 500 \\text{ additional passengers}} \\]"
