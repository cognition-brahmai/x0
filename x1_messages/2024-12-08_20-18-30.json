You can see the streets around what\\'s called Green Square. It used to be called Green Square. At least the rebels not call it Martyr Square in Tripoli. Not very crowded. The rebels went in. Then they pulled out, apparently they\\'re concerned about their security. But Sara is joining us on the phone right now. Sara, the images are powerful from Tripoli. You were right there in Green Square, now called Martyr Square. Where are you now? Give us a sense of what you\\'re seeing and hearing. SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We are outside the city. We basically had to turn and run. We were following the rebels in. And one of the gentleman that was with us in the car said get out, get out now, we have information that Gadhafi\\'s troops are headed this way. They say they have that from intelligence. We ourselves did not see any of Gadhafi\\'s forces in the area, but we certainly felt the tension. We also got quite a scare when they said there are snipers. We also, you know, did not see snipers, though oftentimes you wouldn\\'t see the snipers but you would see people who have been shot. We did not see that as well. However, when we were told to leave, there was definitely fear in the eyes and these rebels definitely said they meant business. They were taking their positions, so we moved out of the Square. I can tell you that the Square picture is very empty for the most part. I mean, what we were seeing is perhaps 30, 40 rebels who were there, most of them armed and ready to fight. We were not seeing civilians really. We saw maybe a few people who were milling about. But, again, most of them seemed to be people who were intent on fighting and staking their claim. BLITZER: Am I right in assuming that all of the rebel forces who were at the Green Square area, they have all left or did some remain behind? SIDNER: No, no. The rebels, 90 percent of them stayed behind. They were taking positions because they were preparing for a fight with what they thought were Gadhafi\\'s forces pushing into the Square. We also, on our way out of town, saw dozens upon dozens, the most that we\\'ve seen so far, number of cars with rebels inside. They were all headed toward Tripoli with their guns ready. So what they are expecting is a real battle here. And we do want to reiterate there are a lot of rumors flying, as you might imagine, Wolf, and you\\'ve been in this sort of situations where, you know, there is so much going on. There is a lot of fear, there\\'s a lot of nervousness, but there\\'s also the feeling of jubilation. But it\\'s tempered because they are not quite sure what\\'s happening with the Gadhafi regime. They were expecting thousands of professional army members out in the streets and they are not seeing them. So they\\'re not sure what to expect, to be honest. BLITZER: And Sara, we know that two of Gadhafi\\'s sons, Saif al-Islam and Saadi, have been arrested. Based on all the information you\\'re getting, do you have any clue, any idea where Moammar Gadhafi himself might be right now? SIDNER: No. Nut I can tell you that one of the main rumors that\\'s going around right now -- and we even heard people celebrating in Zawiya as we were leaving, because they have heard, they believed that Moammar Gadhafi himself have been arrested. There was quite a bit of firing in the air, cheering. We even heard children and women cheering and chanting \"Free Libya, Free Libya,\" but then that died down because everyone said, oh, we don\\'t know, this might be a rumor, we do know his sons have been arrested. Nobody so far has heard from Moammar Gadhafi in the last hour or so. So we are all wondering exactly where he is and so are the rebels. BLITZER: Because the rumors are flying all over the place about Gadhafi, that he\\'s escaped to Algeria, to other countries in Africa, that he\\'s hiding out some place in Tripoli. We are standing by to get accurate information. Sara, hold on for one moment, because General Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, is joining us now. General Clark, NATO, obviously very much involved in this operation. The NATO air power but ground forces as well training these rebels. What can you tell us about what NATO troops have done on the ground as opposed to in the air to help the rebel forces get rid of the Gadhafi regime? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), FMR. NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER: Well, Wolf, it\\'s pretty clear that the NATO forces, the French and British advisers and perhaps others are in there helping them plan and organize this, because what you have seen in the last four weeks is a dramatic improvement in the ability of the rebels to maneuver on the ground. And it\\'s the maneuver augmented by NATO air support which could go after the heavy forces of Gadhafi. BLITZER: All right. General, hold on one second because we got a tape of Sara doing a report. I want to just listen to her report. SIDNER (voice over): Ten minutes later after we talked to some of those in the Square who were happy to be back in their homes who had left to Tunisia, who had left to other countries for safety, they had come back to fight. BLITZER: All right. We\\'re going to cue that tape up. General, sorry. Let\\'s continue this conversation. We\\'ll get Sara on the phone because I want you to talk to her as well. You were telling our viewers here in the United States and around the world that there are NATO troops on the ground with the rebels helping them. Is that right? CLARK: No, I don\\'t think that\\'s actually technically accurate. What I\\'m told is that there are some advisers in there from national forces, but these are not necessarily under NATO command and control. They may be special forces. They may be under the British government. They may be under some other government\\'s control. But it\\'s clear that they have done some work in helping the Libyan rebels organize and plan their maneuver because... BLITZER: I want to interrupt that, General. It\\'s not -- these special forces, whether they are specifically under the command of NATO or directly under the command of various NATO allies, they haven\\'t just been training these rebels. They\\'ve actually helped them go in with precise logistics and intelligence and information to help in this assault. Is that your understanding? CLARK: My understanding is they have been able to provide some information to them, that clearly there\\'s been some logistics brought in, not only -- or perhaps not primarily by NATO member-countries, but by some Arab countries involved in this. And there is a broad coalition working on the ground that is not under NATO command and control is my understanding. NATO is working the air campaign in accordance with the U.N. Security Council resolution. BLITZER: All right, General, hold on for a second. Sara Sidner is with us on the phone. She is on the outskirts of Tripoli. She was at Green Square. But now they pulled back for security reasons. Sara, do you see any evidence of Westerners aiding these rebels as they move towards Tripoli? SIDNER: We are not seeing evidence of that. We drove quite a bit around. We went directly to Green Square, drove through the city from the west and we didn\\'t see anyone in the vicinity of the Square. All we saw were rebel checkpoints and then rebels in the Square and that was about it. Now, to be fair, it is about 4:30 in the morning our time so it\\'s not a time when people would normally be out. But if we were to see anything such as, you know, certain kind of security force, we\\'re not seeing that anywhere near the Square. BLITZER: General, do you have a question for Sara Sidner who is on the scene? CLARK: Yes, I do. And Sara, can you -- can you talk to people and find out whether they have pushed the Gadhafi forces back into this so-called district that is controlled by Gadhafi? SIDNER: I\\'m sorry. You will have to ask me that again. CLARK: Apparently, Gadhafi\\'s forces control one small district in the city. But are the rebel forces pushing against it or are they staying away from it? Have they probed it? What\\'s the status of that? SIDNER: We did hear that they were -- that the rebels say they are not in complete control, that Gadhafi forces do control a small section of the city. That much we do know. What we do not know is how they got the information that they believe that those troops were then turning around and coming into Green Square which the rebels had taken control of. So, yes, we do know that they -- that they are not in complete control of the city and that there are parts, if not just one part, that Gadhafi forces are still in and still control. But we are not hearing the blasts, booms and bangs that you normally hear when there is a firefight going on. CLARK: Right. BLITZER: General, it\\'s going to be daylight -- it\\'s going to be daylight in Libya very soon. It\\'s 4:30 a.m. there now. What do you expect once the sun comes up in terms of fighting and resistance, if you will, from whatever remains of Gadhafi loyalists? CLARK: Well, I think that the fighting -- I think that if Gadhafi still retains his district, I think he\\'ll tighten it up. If there\\'s anyone in control of that district, they\\'ll tighten it up. They\\'ll put snipers on the rooftop. The snipers will have better fields of view. These rebels who have been up all night, they\\'re going to crash down and try to get a few hours of rest and reload and eat something. And so the real time to have broken through Gadhafi\\'s resistance is tonight. Right now. Before that line of defense hardens around Gadhafi\\'s district. The fact that Sara says she\\'s not hearing the shooting going on indicates to me that the rebels\\' attempts to clear the city are not very well organized, honestly. BLITZER: I\\'m sure they are not very well organized. Is that your assessment, Sara, that these -- that these rebel forces, as they move in, they obviously aren\\'t highly trained professional military. Is that right? SIDNER: That is absolutely correct, Wolf. I mean, what we know is, in a really surprising turn, we bumped into someone who we talked to about five months ago when we were in Benghazi, who had never held a gun before, who was from Tripoli but has lived in Canada for years as someone who worked in IT, never picked up a gun and had to start training because he wanted to come back to his country because he was so upset with what is going on and he felt that uprising that it was about time. So he came back here and we just met him in Tripoli. Now, he and his Tripoli brigade, as they are called, these are all guys from Tripoli, they know that city. And that\\'s one advantage they are having. Really know the city well. But they have to start learning how to be a soldier from ex-military, from anyone who would teach them in just about four to five months\\' time. And so what you are seeing is a group of people who may not have the kind of coordination that you might expect certainly from a professional army. They are definitely not a professional army. What we saw in the Square was that of panic, a little bit of concern about how they are going to deal with any kind of tanks flowing in there. What we\\'re seeing BLITZER: It looks like they may -- Gadhafi loyalists may still control a small part of Tripoli but the overwhelming part looks like it\\'s under the control of the rebels as is the country right now. And as the president of the United States said in a statement that he just released tonight, the momentum against the Gadhafi regime has reached a tipping point. The president saying Tripoli is slipping from the grasp of a tyrant. The Gadhafi regime is showing signs of collapsing. We\\'ll take a quick break. More of our coverage right after this.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
