        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells product A, and currently, they sell 500 units every month at $10 each. They're planning to increase the price by 15%, and we need to find out how much revenue they'll generate after this price increase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what revenue is. Revenue is the total income generated from selling goods or services. It's calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit. So, currently, the revenue from product A is 500 units times $10 per unit, which is $5,000 per month.\n\nNow, the store wants to increase the price by 15%. I need to calculate what the new price will be after this increase. To find the increased price, I can multiply the original price by 1 plus the percentage increase. The percentage increase is 15%, which is 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nSo, the new price will be $10 multiplied by 1.15. Let me do that calculation: $10 * 1.15 = $11.50. So, the new price per unit will be $11.50.\n\nNext, I need to find out the new revenue after the price increase. Assuming that the number of units sold remains the same (which is 500 units), the new revenue will be 500 units times $11.50 per unit.\n\nLet's calculate that: 500 * $11.50. Well, 500 * $10 is $5,000, and 500 * $1.50 is $750. So, adding those together, $5,000 + $750 = $5,750.\n\nTherefore, after the 15% price increase, the store will generate $5,750 in revenue from product A each month.\n\nBut wait a minute, is it realistic to assume that the number of units sold remains the same after a price increase? Usually, when you increase the price, the demand might decrease, meaning fewer units might be sold. However, in this problem, it doesn't specify any change in demand, so I'll assume that the number of units sold remains constant.\n\nAlternatively, if there is a price elasticity effect, the quantity sold might decrease, which would affect the revenue. Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. If demand is elastic, a price increase leads to a proportionally larger decrease in quantity demanded, which could reduce revenue. If demand is inelastic, a price increase leads to a proportionally smaller decrease in quantity demanded, which could increase revenue.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide any information about the price elasticity of demand for product A, I'll proceed with the assumption that the quantity sold remains unchanged.\n\nSo, based on that, the new revenue is $5,750 per month.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the price increase might affect the quantity sold, we'd need more information to accurately calculate the new revenue. For example, if we knew the price elasticity of demand, we could estimate the change in quantity demanded and then calculate the new revenue accordingly.\n\nBut given the information provided, the straightforward calculation suggests that the new revenue will be $5,750 per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5750} \\]"
