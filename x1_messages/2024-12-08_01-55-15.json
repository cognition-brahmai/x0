        "content": "So I've got this recursive sequence defined by a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2), with initial terms a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 2. I need to find out what a_10 is. Hmm, this looks familiar; it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values.\n\nIn the Fibonacci sequence, each term is also the sum of the two preceding ones, but it starts with f_1 = 1 and f_2 = 1, or sometimes f_0 = 0 and f_1 = 1. Here, a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 2, which is different.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to calculate each term step by step up to a_10.\n\nSo, let's list out the terms:\n\na_1 = 1\n\na_2 = 2\n\nNow, using the recursive formula:\n\na_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 2 + 1 = 3\n\na_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\na_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 5 + 3 = 8\n\na_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 8 + 5 = 13\n\na_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 13 + 8 = 21\n\na_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 21 + 13 = 34\n\na_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 34 + 21 = 55\n\na_10 = a_9 + a_8 = 55 + 34 = 89\n\nSo, a_10 is 89.\n\nWait a minute, that was straightforward, but I'm wondering if there's a better way to find a_10 without calculating each term individually, especially for larger n.\n\nIn the Fibonacci sequence, there's a closed-form expression called Binet's formula, which allows you to compute the nth term directly without knowing the previous terms. Maybe something similar exists for this sequence.\n\nLet me recall how Binet's formula is derived. It involves solving the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation.\n\nFor the Fibonacci sequence, the recurrence is f_n = f_(n-1) + f_(n-2), which has the characteristic equation r^2 = r + 1. Solving for r gives r = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(5))/2, and then Binet's formula is f_n = (phi^n - (-phi)^(-n))/sqrt(5), where phi is the golden ratio (1 + sqrt(5))/2.\n\nPerhaps I can apply a similar method here.\n\nGiven that our sequence is a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2), the characteristic equation is the same: r^2 = r + 1.\n\nSolving r^2 - r - 1 = 0 gives r = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(5)]/2, just like in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo, the general solution for a_n is a_n = A * phi^n + B * (-phi)^(-n), where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\nGiven a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 2, we can set up a system of equations to solve for A and B.\n\nLet me denote phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 and psi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2.\n\nThen:\n\na_1 = A * phi + B * psi = 1\n\na_2 = A * phi^2 + B * psi^2 = 2\n\nI know that phi^2 = phi + 1 and psi^2 = psi + 1, from the properties of phi and psi.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\na_2 = A*(phi + 1) + B*(psi + 1) = A*phi + A + B*psi + B = (A*phi + B*psi) + (A + B) = a_1 + (A + B) = 2\n\nBut since a_1 = 1, then 1 + (A + B) = 2, which implies A + B = 1.\n\nSo, from a_1:\n\nA*phi + B*psi = 1\n\nAnd from a_2:\n\nA + B = 1\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. A*phi + B*psi = 1\n\n2. A + B = 1\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nFrom equation 2: B = 1 - A\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\nA*phi + (1 - A)*psi = 1\n\nA*phi + psi - A*psi = 1\n\nA*(phi - psi) + psi = 1\n\nA*(phi - psi) = 1 - psi\n\nTherefore, A = (1 - psi)/(phi - psi)\n\nSimilarly, B = 1 - A = [phi - (1 - psi)]/(phi - psi) = (phi - 1 + psi)/(phi - psi)\n\nBut phi - psi = sqrt(5), since phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 and psi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2.\n\nSo, phi - psi = sqrt(5)\n\nAnd phi + psi = 1, since (1 + sqrt(5))/2 + (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = 1\n\nNow, compute A:\n\nA = (1 - psi)/sqrt(5)\n\nSimilarly, B = (phi - 1)/sqrt(5)\n\nBut phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so phi - 1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 - 1 = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2\n\nSimilarly, 1 - psi = 1 - (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (2 - 1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = phi\n\nTherefore, A = phi / sqrt(5)\n\nAnd B = (sqrt(5) - 1)/(2*sqrt(5)) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/(2*sqrt(5)) = [sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(5)) - 1/(2*sqrt(5))] = [1/2 - 1/(2*sqrt(5))]\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, actually, since A = phi / sqrt(5) and B = (phi - 1)/sqrt(5) = psi / sqrt(5)\n\nBecause psi = 1 - phi\n\nWait, but psi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2, and phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2\n\nSo, phi + psi = 1, and phi - psi = sqrt(5)\n\nTherefore, B = (phi - 1)/sqrt(5) = (phi - 1)/sqrt(5)\n\nBut phi - 1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 - 1 = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2\n\nSo, B = ((sqrt(5) - 1)/2)/sqrt(5) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/(2*sqrt(5)) = [sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(5)) - 1/(2*sqrt(5))] = [1/2 - 1/(2*sqrt(5))]\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to express A and B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that a_n = a_1 * phi^n / sqrt(5) + a_2 * psi^n / sqrt(5)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nActually, in the Fibonacci sequence, the general formula is f_n = (phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5)\n\nHere, since our sequence has different initial conditions, perhaps the formula is similar but with different coefficients.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a_n = A * phi^n + B * psi^n, where A and B are determined by the initial conditions.\n\nFrom earlier, we have A = phi / sqrt(5) and B = psi / sqrt(5)\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express a_n in terms of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet me recall that the Fibonacci sequence is defined as f_1 = 1, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 2, f_4 = 3, etc.\n\nIn our sequence, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 5, a_5 = 8, etc., which matches the Fibonacci sequence but shifted by one term.\n\nWait, actually, the Fibonacci sequence is usually defined with f_0 = 0 and f_1 = 1, or f_1 = 1 and f_2 = 1.\n\nIn our case, a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 2, which is different from the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps our sequence is related to the Lucas sequence, which has L_1 = 1 and L_2 = 3.\n\nBut that doesn't match our a_2 = 2.\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet me denote the Fibonacci sequence as f_n, where f_1 = 1, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 2, f_4 = 3, etc.\n\nThen, our sequence a_n seems to be a_n = f_(n+1)\n\nLet's check:\n\nf_2 = 1 = a_1\n\nf_3 = 2 = a_2\n\nf_4 = 3 = a_3\n\nf_5 = 5 = a_4\n\nf_6 = 8 = a_5\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, that seems to work.\n\nSo, a_n = f_(n+1)\n\nTherefore, a_10 = f_11\n\nNow, I need to find f_11.\n\nI know that f_n = (phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5)\n\nSo, f_11 = (phi^11 - psi^11)/sqrt(5)\n\nBut calculating phi^11 and psi^11 might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, since I already calculated up to a_10 step by step and got a_10 = 89, and since a_10 = f_11, then f_11 = 89.\n\nWait, but in the standard Fibonacci sequence, f_11 should be 89.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nf_1 = 1\n\nf_2 = 1\n\nf_3 = 2\n\nf_4 = 3\n\nf_5 = 5\n\nf_6 = 8\n\nf_7 = 13\n\nf_8 = 21\n\nf_9 = 34\n\nf_10 = 55\n\nf_11 = 89\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, a_10 = f_11 = 89.\n\nSo, the value of a_10 is 89.\n\nAlternatively, since I calculated it step by step and got the same result, I can be confident that this is correct.\n\nBut it's interesting to see the connection with the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nIn summary, the sequence defined by a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2), with a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 2, is essentially the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one term, where a_n = f_(n+1).\n\nTherefore, a_10 = f_11 = 89.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{89} \\]"
