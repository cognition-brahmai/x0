So, the letters are R-A-I-L.\n\nFirst, think about words that describe someone who tells untruths. There are a few options like liar, deceiver, fabricator, etc. But since it has to be an anagram of \"rail,\" it probably is a four-letter word.\n\nLooking at the letters R-A-I-L, maybe rearranging them can form \"liar.\" Let's check:\n\nR-A-I-L -> L-I-A-R, which is \"liar.\" That seems to fit perfectly. \"Liar\" means someone who tells untruths.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"liar.\"\n\nBut just to make sure, let's see if there are any other possible anagrams that might fit.\n\nR-A-I-L:\n\n- Rail\n\n- Lair\n\n- Arial\n\n- Rial\n\n- Lari\n\nNone of these other options directly relate to someone who tells untruths like \"liar\" does.\n\nTherefore, \"liar\" is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{liar}} \\]"
