        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The length is 10 meters and the width is 6 meters, and I need to find the diagonal distance from one corner to the opposite corner. Hmm, diagonals in rectangles remind me of the Pythagorean theorem. I think that's probably what I'll need to use here.\n\nSo, in a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and the width as the two legs. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (which would be the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\ndiagonal\u00b2 = length\u00b2 + width\u00b2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ndiagonal\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 + 6\u00b2\n\ndiagonal\u00b2 = 100 + 36\n\ndiagonal\u00b2 = 136\n\nNow, to find the diagonal, I need to take the square root of 136. Let me see:\n\n\u221a136...\n\nI know that 11\u00b2 is 121 and 12\u00b2 is 144. So, 136 is between 121 and 144, meaning the square root is between 11 and 12. Let me try to calculate it more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify \u221a136. Let's see:\n\n136 can be factored into 4 \u00d7 34.\n\nSo, \u221a136 = \u221a(4 \u00d7 34) = \u221a4 \u00d7 \u221a34 = 2\u221a34.\n\nHmm, 34 doesn't have any perfect square factors other than 1, so that's as simplified as it goes.\n\nBut maybe I should find a decimal approximation. Let me think:\n\nI know that \u221a36 is 6, and \u221a25 is 5. 34 is closer to 36 than to 25, so \u221a34 should be a little less than 6.\n\nLet me try 5.8:\n\n5.8 \u00d7 5.8 = 33.64, which is less than 34.\n\n5.9 \u00d7 5.9 = 34.81, which is more than 34.\n\nSo, \u221a34 is between 5.8 and 5.9. Maybe around 5.83 or so.\n\nTherefore, 2\u221a34 is approximately 2 \u00d7 5.83 = 11.66 meters.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's a more accurate way to find this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a calculator to find the square root of 136 directly.\n\n\u221a136 \u2248 11.6619037897.\n\nSo, the diagonal is approximately 11.66 meters.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it in the exact form, which is 2\u221a34 meters.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to use the distance formula from coordinate geometry. If I place the rectangle on a coordinate plane, with one corner at the origin (0,0), then the opposite corner would be at (10,6). The distance between these two points is given by:\n\ndistance = \u221a( (10 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2 ) = \u221a(100 + 36) = \u221a136, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the diagonal is \u221a136 meters, or 2\u221a34 meters, which is approximately 11.66 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\sqrt{34} \\text{ meters} \\approx 11.66 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
