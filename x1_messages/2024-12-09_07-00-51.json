        "content": "I'm sorry, but the information you provided seems to have some inaccuracies. Martin Luther King Jr. was not involved in the Women's Suffrage Movement, nor was he born in 1949. Let me provide you with the correct information.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, not Birmingham, Alabama. He was a central figure in the African American Civil Rights Movement, not the Women's Suffrage Movement. He is renowned for his role in ending racial segregation and discrimination through nonviolent civil disobedience and other methods.\n\nThe Women's Suffrage Movement was focused on securing voting rights for women, which was achieved with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. Martin Luther King Jr.'s work was primarily in the area of civil rights for African Americans.\n\nMoreover, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which seeks to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, was first introduced in Congress in 1923 and was passed by Congress in 1972, but it was not ratified by the necessary number of states to be enacted into law. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, so he was not involved in the establishment of the ERA in 1972.\n\nLastly, Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, not in 1980, for his nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in America.\n\nI recommend checking the source you provided, as it seems to contain factual errors. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\n\n**Source:**\n- NobelPrize.org. \"Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 Facts.\" Nobel Prize. Nobel Media AB 2021.
