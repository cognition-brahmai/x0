        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there are 5 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. We need to figure out how many handshakes take place in total.\n\n**First possible answer:**\n\nOne way to approach this is to think about it person by person. Let's label the people as A, B, C, D, and E for clarity.\n\n- Person A shakes hands with B, C, D, and E. That's 4 handshakes.\n\n- Person B has already shaken hands with A, so they only shake hands with C, D, and E. That's 3 additional handshakes.\n\n- Person C has already shaken hands with A and B, so they shake hands with D and E. That's 2 more handshakes.\n\n- Person D has already shaken hands with A, B, and C, so they only shake hands with E. That's 1 more handshake.\n\n- Person E has already shaken hands with everyone else, so they don't initiate any new handshakes.\n\nNow, if we add up all these handshakes: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes in total.\n\n**Second possible answer:**\n\nAnother way to look at this is to use the concept of combinations. Since each handshake involves two distinct people, and the order doesn't matter (A shaking hands with B is the same as B shaking hands with A), we can use the combination formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of handshakes} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\]\n\nSo, again, we arrive at 10 handshakes.\n\n**Third possible answer:**\n\nLet's consider another angle. If there are 5 people, and each shakes hands with every other person, we can think of it as each person shaking hands with 4 others. So, initially, it might seem like there are 5 people each doing 4 handshakes, totaling 20 handshakes. However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2 to correct for this double counting.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of handshakes} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nAgain, 10 handshakes.\n\n**Fourth possible answer:**\n\nImagine arranging the 5 people in a circle. Each person shakes hands with the people adjacent to them and also with those across. Wait, this might get complicated. Let's see:\n\n- Each person shakes hands with 4 others.\n\n- Total handshakes if counted per person: 5 people \u00d7 4 handshakes each = 20.\n\n- But each handshake is between two people, so we've double-counted.\n\n- Therefore, the actual number of unique handshakes is 20 \u00f7 2 = 10.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\n**Fifth possible answer:**\n\nLet's try to visualize this with smaller numbers and see if there's a pattern.\n\n- With 2 people: Only 1 handshake.\n\n- With 3 people: Each shakes hands with the other two, but since order doesn't matter, it's 3 handshakes.\n\n- With 4 people: Each shakes hands with 3 others, but again, double counting, so it's (4 \u00d7 3) \u00f7 2 = 6 handshakes.\n\n- With 5 people: Following the pattern, (5 \u00d7 4) \u00f7 2 = 10 handshakes.\n\nThis seems consistent with the previous methods.\n\n**Ranking the solutions:**\n\n1. **Second possible answer (using combinations):** This is the most precise and mathematically sound approach. It directly applies the combination formula, which is designed for such scenarios where order doesn't matter.\n\n2. **First possible answer (step-by-step counting):** This method is straightforward and builds intuition by breaking down the problem person by person. It's easy to understand and less abstract than the combination formula.\n\n3. **Third possible answer (total handshakes divided by two):** This approach also arrives at the correct answer and introduces the concept of double counting, which is important in combinatorics.\n\n4. **Fourth possible answer (circle arrangement):** This visualization helps in understanding that the arrangement of people doesn't affect the total number of handshakes, reinforcing that the answer is consistent regardless of how people are positioned.\n\n5. **Fifth possible answer (pattern recognition):** This method is useful for understanding the general formula by observing patterns in smaller groups. It's a good way to verify the correctness of the formula for larger groups.\n\n**Best possible output:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most accurate and complete answer is obtained using the combination formula, which directly calculates the number of unique handshakes without double counting. Therefore, the best answer is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of handshakes} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\]\n\nSo, there are 10 handshakes in total."
