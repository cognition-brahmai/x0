        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the factory produces 5000 widgets every 8 hours. We need to find out how many widgets it produces in one week.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many 8-hour shifts there are in one week. There are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours in a week is 24 hours/day * 7 days = 168 hours.\n\nNow, to find out how many 8-hour shifts are in 168 hours, we divide 168 hours by 8 hours/shift. So, 168 / 8 = 21 shifts in one week.\n\nSince the factory produces 5000 widgets per shift, we can find the total production in one week by multiplying the number of shifts by the production per shift. That is, 21 shifts * 5000 widgets/shift.\n\nLet me do the math: 21 * 5000 = 105,000 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nFirst, hours in a week: 24 hours/day * 7 days = 168 hours. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of 8-hour shifts in 168 hours: 168 / 8 = 21. That also seems right.\n\nProduction per shift: 5000 widgets.\n\nTotal production: 21 * 5000 = 105,000 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let's try calculating the production rate per hour and then scale it up to a week.\n\nProduction per 8 hours: 5000 widgets.\n\nSo, production per hour: 5000 widgets / 8 hours = 625 widgets/hour.\n\nTotal hours in a week: 168 hours.\n\nTotal production in a week: 625 widgets/hour * 168 hours.\n\nLet's calculate that: 625 * 168.\n\nFirst, 600 * 168 = 100,800.\n\nThen, 25 * 168 = 4,200.\n\nAdding them up: 100,800 + 4,200 = 105,000 widgets.\n\nOkay, that matches our previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of daily production and then multiply by 7 for the week.\n\nProduction per 8-hour shift: 5000 widgets.\n\nNumber of 8-hour shifts in a day: 24 hours / 8 hours/shift = 3 shifts/day.\n\nDaily production: 3 shifts/day * 5000 widgets/shift = 15,000 widgets/day.\n\nWeekly production: 15,000 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 105,000 widgets/week.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overthinking this. All these methods lead to the same answer: 105,000 widgets per week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any assumptions we're making that might not hold true.\n\nFor example, does the factory operate continuously without any downtime? Are there any maintenance periods or breaks that might affect the production time?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any downtime, so we can assume that the factory operates continuously during the 168 hours of the week.\n\nAlso, it's important to ensure that the production rate remains constant across all shifts and days.\n\nAgain, the problem doesn't indicate any variation in production rate, so we can assume it's constant.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the week in question is a standard workweek or if it includes any overtime or additional shifts.\n\nBut since the problem specifies \"one week,\" and doesn't provide any additional information, we can proceed with the standard calculation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory produces 105,000 widgets in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105000} \\]"
