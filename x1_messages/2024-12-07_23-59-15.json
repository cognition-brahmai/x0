        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a jar with 5 red marbles, 8 blue marbles, and 4 green marbles. So, total marbles in the jar are 5 + 8 + 4, which is 17 marbles.\n\nThe question is, if you draw three marbles without replacement, what's the probability that you draw exactly one marble of each color? Okay, so I need to find the probability of drawing one red, one blue, and one green marble in any order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when drawing three marbles from 17. Since the order doesn't matter (it's a combination, not a permutation), I should use combinations.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 17 is C(17, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(17, 3) = 17! / (3!(17 - 3)!) = (17 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 15) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 680.\n\nSo, there are 680 possible ways to draw 3 marbles from 17.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing one red, one blue, and one green marble.\n\nSince the marbles are of different colors, and I need one of each, I can calculate the number of ways to choose one red, one blue, and one green separately, and then multiply them together.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red marble from five is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one blue marble from eight is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one green marble from four is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 4 = 160.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 160 / 680.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 40.\n\n160 \u00f7 40 = 4\n\n680 \u00f7 40 = 17\n\nSo, the probability is 4/17.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the different orders in which I can draw the marbles.\n\nFor example, I could draw red first, then blue, then green, or any other order.\n\nBut since I'm using combinations, which don't consider order, I don't need to multiply by the number of permutations of the colors.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the approach I took earlier, I'm already considering all possible combinations of one red, one blue, and one green, regardless of the order.\n\nSo, the calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it using permutations if I consider the order matters, but I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nLet's try that approach to verify.\n\nIf order matters, the total number of ways to draw three marbles in a specific order from 17 is P(17, 3) = 17 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 15 = 4080.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, the number of ways to draw one red, one blue, and one green in a specific order.\n\nFor example, red first, blue second, green third.\n\nThe probability for that specific order would be:\n\n(5/17) \u00d7 (8/16) \u00d7 (4/15)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst draw: 5 red out of 17, so 5/17.\n\nAfter drawing a red, there are 16 marbles left, including 8 blue.\n\nSo, second draw: 8 blue out of 16, which is 8/16 = 1/2.\n\nThen, third draw: 4 green out of the remaining 15 marbles, so 4/15.\n\nSo, the probability for red-blue-green in that order is (5/17) \u00d7 (1/2) \u00d7 (4/15) = (5 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4) / (17 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 15) = 20 / 510 = 2/51.\n\nNow, there are 3! = 6 possible orders to draw one of each color.\n\nSo, total probability is 6 \u00d7 (2/51) = 12/51 = 4/17.\n\nSo, this matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 4/17.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I used combinations, and in the second approach, I used permutations, but both gave me the same result of 4/17.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 17, which is C(17, 3) = 680.\n\nThen, calculate the number of ways to choose one red, one blue, and one green marble, which is C(5,1) \u00d7 C(8,1) \u00d7 C(4,1) = 5 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 4 = 160.\n\nTherefore, probability = 160 / 680 = 4/17.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability of drawing one of each color without replacement.\n\nSo, the first marble can be any color.\n\nLet's say I draw a red first.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a red first is 5/17.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a blue second is 8/16, since one red has already been drawn, leaving 16 marbles.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a green third is 4/15.\n\nSo, the probability for this specific sequence is (5/17) \u00d7 (8/16) \u00d7 (4/15).\n\nSimilarly, I can calculate for other sequences and sum them up.\n\nBut in the previous approach, I already did that and got 4/17.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the order doesn't matter, and directly use the combination formula, as I did first.\n\nSo, both approaches confirm that the probability is 4/17.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 4/17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{17}} \\]"
