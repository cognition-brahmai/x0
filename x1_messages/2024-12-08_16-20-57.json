        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's start by creating the JavaScript function that takes an array of integers and returns an object with the frequency count of each unique number.\n\n### Step 1: Create the Function\n\nWe'll write a function called `countFrequencies` that accepts an array of integers. Inside the function, we'll use a JavaScript object to keep track of the frequency of each number. Here's how we can do it:\n\n```javascript\nfunction countFrequencies(arr) {\n  const frequency = {};\n  for (const num of arr) {\n    if (frequency.hasOwnProperty(num)) {\n      frequency[num]++;\n    } else {\n      frequency[num] = 1;\n    }\n  }\n  return frequency;\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each number in the array. If the number already exists as a key in the `frequency` object, it increments its value by one. If it doesn't exist, it adds the number as a key with a value of one.\n\n### Step 2: Write Unit Tests with Jest\n\nNext, we'll write some unit tests using Jest to ensure our function works correctly. We need to test various scenarios, including arrays with multiple duplicates, single elements, and empty arrays.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Jest set up in your project. If not, you can install it using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev jest\n```\n\nThen, create a test file, say `countFrequencies.test.js`, and write the following tests:\n\n```javascript\nconst countFrequencies = require('./path-to-your-function');\n\ntest('counts frequencies correctly with duplicates', () => {\n  const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3];\n  const expected = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3};\n  expect(countFrequencies(arr)).toEqual(expected);\n});\n\ntest('counts frequency of single element', () => {\n  const arr = [5];\n  const expected = {5: 1};\n  expect(countFrequencies(arr)).toEqual(expected);\n});\n\ntest('handles empty array', () => {\n  const arr = [];\n  const expected = {};\n  expect(countFrequencies(arr)).toEqual(expected);\n});\n\ntest('counts frequencies with negative numbers', () => {\n  const arr = [-1, -2, -1, -2, -2];\n  const expected = {-1: 2, -2: 3};\n  expect(countFrequencies(arr)).toEqual(expected);\n});\n\ntest('counts frequencies with zero', () => {\n  const arr = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1];\n  const expected = {0: 3, 1: 3};\n  expect(countFrequencies(arr)).toEqual(expected);\n});\n```\n\nIn these tests, we're covering different cases:\n\n1. An array with multiple duplicates.\n2. An array with a single element.\n3. An empty array.\n4. An array with negative numbers.\n5. An array including zero.\n\n### Step 3: Run the Tests\n\nTo run your tests, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpx jest path-to-your-test-file\n```\n\nReplace `path-to-your-test-file` with the actual path to your test file.\n\n### Summary\n\nWe've created a function that counts the frequency of each unique number in an array of integers and wrote several unit tests using Jest to ensure its correctness. This approach covers various scenarios and helps maintain the reliability of the function.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
