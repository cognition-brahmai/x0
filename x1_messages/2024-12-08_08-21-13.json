Rabbit holes are typically not very deep or extensive, so you probably wouldn't go far. However, it's essential to be cautious, as there may be sharp turns or obstacles inside the hole that could cause injury. It's always best to avoid stepping into animal burrows to prevent any potential harm to yourself or the animals."
