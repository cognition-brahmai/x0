        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got 100 light bulbs all starting off, and I'm going to make 100 passes, flipping switches in a specific pattern each time. On the first pass, I flip every single bulb, so all of them get turned on. On the second pass, I flip every second bulb, which means bulb 2, 4, 6, and so on. On the third pass, every third bulb, and this continues up to the 100th pass where I just flip the 100th bulb.\n\nI need to figure out how many bulbs are left on after all these passes.\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about what happens to each individual bulb. Let's take bulb number 1, for example. It gets flipped on the first pass. Since it's the first bulb, it doesn't get flipped again in any of the subsequent passes because I'm flipping every nth bulb on the nth pass, and no other pass includes bulb 1 except the first one. So, it gets flipped once, from off to on, and stays on.\n\nNow, bulb number 2: It gets flipped on the first pass (on), then on the second pass (off), and that's it. So, it's off at the end.\n\nBulb number 3: First pass (on), third pass (off), and that's it.\n\nWait, but actually, bulb 3 would be flipped on the first and third passes. So, flipped on, then off.\n\nBut, hold on, does flipping it an even number of times mean it ends up off, since it starts off and gets flipped twice?\n\nWait, let's think about the general case.\n\nFor any given bulb k, it will be flipped on pass 1, pass 2 if k is divisible by 2, pass 3 if k is divisible by 3, and so on, up to pass k.\n\nSo, the number of times bulb k is flipped is equal to the number of divisors of k.\n\nIf a bulb is flipped an odd number of times, it will end up on (since it starts off).\n\nIf it's flipped an even number of times, it will end up off.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding how many bulbs have an odd number of divisors.\n\nNow, which numbers have an odd number of divisors?\n\nMost numbers have divisors in pairs. For example, 6 has divisors 1 and 6, 2 and 3. So, even number of divisors.\n\nPerfect squares are the exceptions because one of their divisors is repeated. For example, 9 has divisors 1, 3, and 9. So, an odd number of divisors.\n\nTherefore, only perfect squares will have their bulbs left on.\n\nSo, I need to find how many perfect squares there are between 1 and 100.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n1^2 = 1\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n6^2 = 36\n\n7^2 = 49\n\n8^2 = 64\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nThat's 10 perfect squares.\n\nTherefore, 10 bulbs are left on.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIs there a chance I'm missing something?\n\nLet me consider bulb 1: flipped once (on).\n\nBulb 2: flipped twice (on, off).\n\nBulb 3: flipped twice (on, off).\n\nBulb 4: flipped three times (on, off, on).\n\nSo, bulb 4 is on.\n\nBulb 5: flipped twice (on, off).\n\nBulb 6: flipped four times (on, off, on, off).\n\nSo, off.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYes, it seems like only the bulbs whose numbers are perfect squares are left on.\n\nHence, the answer should be 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
