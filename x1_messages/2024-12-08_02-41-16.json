Here it goes:\n\nI'm a rodent known for my relentless rustling, residing in rural regions. I'm often seen rummaging through rubbish, searching for remnants of repast. My fur is russet, and my eyes are beady, always on the lookout for rivals or rodent predators. I'm not particularly renowned for my intelligence, but I'm remarkably resilient. Even in the roughest terrains, I can thrive, thanks to my resourceful nature. So, tell me, what am I?\n\nHint: Think about a common critter often found in rural areas, known for its scavenging habits and adaptability."
