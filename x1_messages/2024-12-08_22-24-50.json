Yeah, those little brown things that smell all nice and roasted. You can get them from a shop or maybe even a supermarket. Make sure they're fresh; nothing worse than stale beans.\n\nNow, once you've got your beans, you need to grind them. There are these things called coffee grinders or\u78e8\u8c46\u673a. Some people have fancy machines, but even a simple hand grinder will do. You just pop the beans in and turn the handle until they're nice and fine, like sand. Not too coarse, not too fine; just right.\n\nAfter grinding, you'll need a filter. These are usually paper or maybe metal, depending on what you prefer. Place the filter in your coffee maker, whatever model you have. Could be a drip machine, a French press, or even one of those fancy espresso machines if you're feeling posh.\n\nNow, pour the ground coffee into the filter. Don't pack it down or anything; just let it sit lightly. Then, slowly pour hot water over the grounds. Not boiling, mind you; just hot enough to extract all the flavor. Let it steep for a bit, maybe a minute or two, depending on your coffee maker.\n\nOnce it's done brewing, you'll have this lovely brown liquid in your cup. Add sugar if you like it sweet, or maybe some milk or creamer if you prefer it milky. Stir it all up until it's well combined. And there you go! A nice cup of coffee to start your day or give you a pick-me-up whenever you need it.\n\nJust remember, practice makes perfect. So, keep trying until you get it just right. And don't forget to enjoy it! After all, that's what it's all about.\n\n**How to make coffee (step by step):**\n\n1. **Get fresh coffee beans.** Make sure they're nice and roasted.\n\n2. **Grind the beans.** Use a grinder to make them fine, like sand.\n\n3. **Prepare the filter.** Place it in your coffee maker.\n\n4. **Add ground coffee to the filter.** Don't pack it down.\n\n5. **Pour hot water over the grounds.** Not boiling, just hot.\n\n6. **Let it brew.** Wait for a minute or two.\n\n7. **Add sugar, milk, or creamer if you like.** Stir well.\n\n8. **Enjoy your coffee!**"
