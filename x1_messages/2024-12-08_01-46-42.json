She was my childhood friend, and no matter what happened, we always found our way back to each other. It was a sunny day, and I remember we were playing near the river, just like we used to do all the time. She had this big smile on her face, and her hair was blowing in the wind. I felt special that day, like nothing else mattered except being with her. Even though we had our ups and downs, that day remains one of the happiest in my memory. So, I guess that's my favorite day."
