I know that the road ahead is fraught with danger and uncertainty, but I have faith in your courage and resilience. Remember, even the smallest person can change the course of the future.\n\nI recall the days when you were just a young hobbit living in the Shire, unaware of the great destiny that awaited you. Now, you carry the weight of Middle-earth on your shoulders, a burden that few could bear. But you are not alone, Frodo. You have the love and support of your friends, and the guidance of the wise.\n\nAs you journey forth, remember that darkness cannot overcome light. The power of friendship and fellowship will see you through even the darkest times. Do not lose heart, for hope is often found in the unlikeliest of places.\n\nI implore you to stay strong, my friend. Trust in your own strength and the strength of those who accompany you. Together, you can overcome any obstacle that stands in your way.\n\nIf ever you feel overwhelmed, close your eyes and think of the Shire, of the simple joys that make life worth living. Let those memories sustain you and give you the courage to press on.\n\nKnow that I am always with you in spirit, guiding you and watching over you. You are not alone in this fight.\n\nWith all my heart,\n\nGandalf the Grey"
