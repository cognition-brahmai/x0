        "content": "So, the train is going at an average speed of 90 kilometers per hour, and it takes 4 hours to get to where it's going. I need to find out how far away the destination is, right? Well, to figure out distance when you have speed and time, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, in this case, it's:\n\nDistance = 90 km/h \u00d7 4 hours\n\nNow, when you multiply those, the hours unit cancels out, and you're left with kilometers. Let's do the math:\n\n90 km/h \u00d7 4 h = 360 km\n\nSo, the destination is 360 kilometers away.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check that. What if the train wasn't going at a constant speed? The problem says it's an average speed, so even if it slowed down or sped up at times, overall, it's averaging 90 km/h. So, using the average speed in the formula should give the correct distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in parts. For each hour, the train covers 90 kilometers. So, in 4 hours, it would cover:\n\n90 km/h \u00d7 1 h = 90 km (first hour)\n\n90 km/h \u00d7 1 h = 90 km (second hour)\n\n90 km/h \u00d7 1 h = 90 km (third hour)\n\n90 km/h \u00d7 1 h = 90 km (fourth hour)\n\nNow, add them up: 90 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 360 km\n\nSame answer as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any stopping time or something, but the problem doesn't mention any stops, so I think it's safe to assume the train is moving continuously at that average speed.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nWe can rearrange this to find distance:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nWhich is what I did earlier. So, again, it confirms that the distance is 360 kilometers.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units again. Speed is in kilometers per hour, and time is in hours, so multiplying them gives kilometers, which is what we want.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The destination is 360 kilometers away.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
