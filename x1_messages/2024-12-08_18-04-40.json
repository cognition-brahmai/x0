        "content": "Let's see. So, this man starts at his house and walks 4 miles east. Then he turns left and walks 3 miles north. After that, he turns left again and walks 4 miles west, and finally, turns left once more and walks 2 miles south. I need to find out how far he is from his starting point.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize this or maybe draw a diagram to keep track of his movements. Let's try to do that step by step.\n\nHe starts at his house, which I'll call point A. He walks 4 miles east to point B. Then he turns left. Since he was walking east, turning left would mean he's now facing north, so he walks 3 miles north to point C.\n\nNext, he turns left again. Now, he was facing north, so turning left means he's facing west, and he walks 4 miles west to point D.\n\nThen, he turns left once more. He was facing west, so turning left means he's facing south, and he walks 2 miles south to point E.\n\nOkay, now I need to find the distance from point E back to point A.\n\nLet me try to plot these points on a coordinate grid to make it easier. Let's assume his house is at the origin, (0,0).\n\n- Starting at (0,0), he walks 4 miles east to (4,0).\n\n- Then turns left to north and walks 3 miles to (4,3).\n\n- Turns left to west and walks 4 miles to (0,3).\n\n- Turns left to south and walks 2 miles to (0,1).\n\nSo, now he's at (0,1), and his starting point is at (0,0). The distance between these two points is simply the difference in the y-coordinates, which is 1 mile.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n- East 4 miles: (0+4, 0) = (4,0)\n\n- North 3 miles: (4, 0+3) = (4,3)\n\n- West 4 miles: (4-4, 3) = (0,3)\n\n- South 2 miles: (0, 3-2) = (0,1)\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, he's at (0,1), and his starting point is at (0,0). The distance between these two points is indeed 1 mile.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using the Pythagorean theorem, but since they're aligned along the y-axis, the distance is just the straight line up or down.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total displacement. He started at (0,0) and ended at (0,1), so his net displacement is 1 mile north.\n\nDuring his journey, he walked east 4 miles and then west 4 miles, so those cancel each other out. Similarly, he walked north 3 miles and south 2 miles, so his net movement in the north-south direction is 1 mile north.\n\nTherefore, he's 1 mile north of his starting point.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 1 mile.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
