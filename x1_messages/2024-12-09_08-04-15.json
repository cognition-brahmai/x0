        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 100 people attending a conference.\n\nOn the first day, 40% of them wear glasses. To find out how many that is, I'll calculate 40% of 100.\n\n40% of 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40 people\n\nSo, 40 people wear glasses on the first day.\n\nOn the second day, 20 more people wear glasses than on the first day. That means we add 20 to the number of people wearing glasses on the first day.\n\n40 people + 20 people = 60 people\n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of the total attendees this represents. There are still 100 people attending, so we need to find what percentage 60 is of 100.\n\nTo find the percentage, we use the formula:\n\n( part / whole ) * 100%\n\nSo, (60 / 100) * 100% = 60%\n\nTherefore, 60% of the attendees wore glasses on the second day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
