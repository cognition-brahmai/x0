        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if it takes 6 people 4 hours to build a wall, how long will it take for 12 people to build the same wall? Hmm, it seems like a straightforward problem, but I want to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the relationship between the number of people and the time it takes to build the wall. I think that more people would mean the wall gets built faster, so there's an inverse relationship between the number of people and the time taken. Like, if you double the number of people, the time should be halved, right?\n\nLet me test that idea. If 6 people take 4 hours, then 12 people, being double, should take half the time, so 2 hours. Wait, but I should probably check if this makes sense in terms of work done.\n\nI recall that work is equal to the number of people multiplied by the time they work, assuming they all work at the same rate. So, work = people \u00d7 time. In this case, the work is building one wall.\n\nSo, for 6 people working 4 hours, the work is 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 person-hours.\n\nNow, if we have 12 people, and we want to find out how long it takes them to do the same amount of work, which is 24 person-hours.\n\nLet's let t be the time it takes for 12 people to build the wall. So, work = 12 \u00d7 t = 24 person-hours.\n\nNow, solving for t: 12t = 24 \u21d2 t = 24 / 12 \u21d2 t = 2 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my initial thought. So, it should take 12 people 2 hours to build the same wall.\n\nBut wait, is there any other factor to consider? Is the relationship really that linear? I mean, maybe with more people, there could be coordination issues or something, but the problem doesn't mention any complications like that. So, I think it's safe to assume that the relationship is directly inverse.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If 6 people take 4 hours, then one person would take 6 times longer, right? Because if one person is doing all the work alone, it should take longer.\n\nSo, for one person, time = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 hours.\n\nNow, if we have 12 people, they should take 24 hours divided by 12, which is again 2 hours.\n\nOkay, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of rates. The rate at which work is done is work per unit time.\n\nSo, the combined rate of 6 people is 1 wall per 4 hours, which is 1/4 wall per hour.\n\nTherefore, the rate per person is (1/4)/6 = 1/24 wall per hour.\n\nNow, if we have 12 people, their combined rate is 12 \u00d7 (1/24) = 12/24 = 1/2 wall per hour.\n\nSo, to build one wall, time = 1 / (1/2) = 2 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 6 people take 4 hours, then for 12 people, let's set up a proportion.\n\nNumber of people inversely proportional to time, so:\n\n6 people \u00d7 4 hours = 12 people \u00d7 t hours\n\nSo, 24 = 12t \u21d2 t = 2 hours.\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlright, it seems consistent across different methods. So, I'm confident that the answer is 2 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about whether there could be any constraints or real-world factors that might affect this.\n\nFor example, maybe the wall has a limited work area, so adding more people wouldn't help because they'd get in each other's way. But the problem doesn't suggest any such constraints, so I think it's safe to assume that the relationship is purely mathematical.\n\nAlso, all people are assumed to work at the same rate, which is a common assumption in these problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take 12 people 2 hours to build the same wall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
