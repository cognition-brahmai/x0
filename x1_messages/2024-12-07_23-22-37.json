        "content": "So I have this probability problem here. It's about drawing 5 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards without replacement, and I need to find the probability of getting a flush, which means all five cards are of the same suit. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a standard deck of cards looks like. There are 52 cards in total, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards: ace through 10, and then jack, queen, and king.\n\nNow, the problem is about drawing 5 cards without replacement, which means once a card is drawn, it's not put back into the deck. So, each draw affects the remaining cards in the deck.\n\nI need to find the probability that all five cards are of the same suit. That could be all hearts, all diamonds, all clubs, or all spades.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, first, let's find the total number of possible ways to draw 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards. Since the order in which we draw the cards doesn't matter, this is a combination problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = \\frac{52!}{5! \\times 47!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating factorials can be tedious, but I know that:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2,598,960\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 2,598,960 possible ways to draw 5 cards from a deck of 52.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the ways to draw 5 cards all from the same suit.\n\nSince there are 4 suits, and for each suit, there are \\(\\binom{13}{5}\\) ways to choose 5 cards from that suit.\n\nSo, the number of ways to get a flush in one specific suit is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{13}{5} = \\frac{13!}{5!(13-5)!} = \\frac{13!}{5! \\times 8!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 1,287\n\\]\n\nSince there are 4 suits, the total number of ways to get a flush in any suit is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 1,287 = 5,148\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability of getting a flush is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{5,148}{2,598,960}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5,148 \\div 12}{2,598,960 \\div 12} = \\frac{429}{216,580}\n\\]\n\nThis seems reducible further. Let's check for common factors.\n\nIs 429 and 216,580 divisible by any common number?\n\n429 divided by 3 is 143, since 4+2+9=15, which is divisible by 3.\n\n216,580 divided by 3: Let's check if 2+1+6+5+8+0=22, which is not divisible by 3, so no.\n\nIs 429 divisible by 11? 4 - 2 + 9 = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n\n429 \u00f7 11 = 39\n\n216,580 \u00f7 11 = 19,689.0909... not an integer.\n\nSo, 11 is not a common factor.\n\nIs 39 and 216,580 divisible by any common number?\n\n39 is 3 \u00d7 13.\n\n216,580 \u00f7 3 = 72,193.333... not an integer.\n\nSo, no common factors other than 1.\n\nTherefore, the simplified probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{429}{216,580}\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{429}{216,580} \\approx 0.002\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.002, or 0.2%.\n\nWait a minute, this seems too low. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way to calculate the probability of getting a flush is to consider the probability of each successive card being of the same suit as the previous ones.\n\nStarting with the first card, there are 52 cards, and any card can be the first one, so the probability is 1.\n\nThe second card needs to be of the same suit as the first card. After drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left, and 12 of them are of the same suit.\n\nSo, the probability for the second card is \\(\\frac{12}{51}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the third card needs to be of the same suit, and now there are 50 cards left, with 11 of the same suit.\n\nSo, the probability for the third card is \\(\\frac{11}{50}\\).\n\nContinuing this logic:\n\nFourth card: \\(\\frac{10}{49}\\)\n\nFifth card: \\(\\frac{9}{48}\\)\n\nSo, the overall probability would be:\n\n\\[\n1 \\times \\frac{12}{51} \\times \\frac{11}{50} \\times \\frac{10}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{48}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\nFirst, \\(\\frac{12}{51} = \\frac{4}{17}\\)\n\nThen, \\(\\frac{4}{17} \\times \\frac{11}{50} = \\frac{44}{850} = \\frac{22}{425}\\)\n\nNext, \\(\\frac{22}{425} \\times \\frac{10}{49} = \\frac{220}{20,875} = \\frac{44}{4,175}\\)\n\nFinally, \\(\\frac{44}{4,175} \\times \\frac{9}{48} = \\frac{396}{200,400} = \\frac{33}{16,700}\\)\n\nSimplifying \\(\\frac{33}{16,700}\\):\n\n33 and 16,700 have no common factors other than 1, so this is the simplified form.\n\nConverting to decimal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{33}{16,700} \\approx 0.001976\n\\]\n\nWhich is approximately 0.002, or 0.2%, matching my previous calculation.\n\nWait, but in poker, I recall that the probability of getting a flush is higher than that. Maybe because in poker, a straight flush or royal flush is subtracted, but in this problem, it's just about getting any five cards of the same suit, regardless of their sequence.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that in poker, straight flushes and royal flushes are excluded from flushes, but in this problem, since it's just about all five cards being of the same suit, perhaps sequences don't matter.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I considered any five cards of the same suit, without considering if they form a straight flush or not.\n\nSo, perhaps in this problem, we are to consider only the flushes that are not straight flushes or royal flushes.\n\nIn poker, a royal flush is a specific type of straight flush, which is the highest ranking hand.\n\nSo, in poker, flushes exclude straight flushes and royal flushes.\n\nBut in this problem, it just says \"a flush\", without specifying excluding straight flushes.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I need to consider whether to exclude straight flushes or not.\n\nLet me check the standard definition of a flush.\n\nIn poker, a flush is defined as five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence (which would make it a straight flush or royal flush).\n\nHowever, in some variants, a straight flush is considered a higher hand than a flush, but still a flush is defined as five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps I should subtract the number of straight flushes and royal flushes from the total number of flushes.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of flushes, including straight flushes and royal flushes.\n\nThen, subtract the number of straight flushes and royal flushes to get the number of pure flushes.\n\nBut the problem says \"a flush\", without specifying.\n\nTo be safe, I'll calculate both ways.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability including straight flushes and royal flushes.\n\nSecond, calculate the probability excluding straight flushes and royal flushes.\n\nStarting with the first approach:\n\nTotal number of flushes, including straight flushes and royal flushes, is 4 \u00d7 \\(\\binom{13}{5}\\) = 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nTotal number of possible hands: 2,598,960.\n\nProbability: 5,148 / 2,598,960 = 429 / 216,580 \u2248 0.001976.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of straight flushes and royal flushes.\n\nA straight flush consists of five cards in sequence, all of the same suit.\n\nA royal flush is a specific type of straight flush, consisting of ten, jack, queen, king, and ace of the same suit.\n\nFirst, find the number of straight flushes.\n\nIn a suit, there are 10 possible sequences for a straight flush:\n\n- 10, J, Q, K, A\n\n- 9, 10, J, Q, K\n\n- 8, 9, 10, J, Q\n\n- ...\n\n- A, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nSo, 10 sequences per suit.\n\nThere are 4 suits, so total straight flushes are 10 \u00d7 4 = 40.\n\nHowever, among these, the royal flush is included, specifically the sequence 10, J, Q, K, A in each suit.\n\nSince royal flush is already included in the straight flushes, we don't need to count it separately.\n\nSo, there are 40 straight flushes in total.\n\nNow, if we want to find the number of pure flushes, excluding straight flushes, we subtract the number of straight flushes from the total flushes.\n\nPure flushes = total flushes - straight flushes = 5,148 - 40 = 5,108.\n\nThen, the probability of getting a pure flush is 5,108 / 2,598,960.\n\nSimplifying:\n\n5,108 \u00f7 4 = 1,277\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 4 = 649,740\n\nSo, 1,277 / 649,740.\n\nThis fraction seems irreducible.\n\nConverting to decimal:\n\n1,277 / 649,740 \u2248 0.001965.\n\nWhich is still approximately 0.002 or 0.2%.\n\nComparing this with my earlier calculation that included straight flushes (0.001976), the difference is negligible for practical purposes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for this problem, since it doesn't specify excluding straight flushes, I can stick with the initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 0.002, or 0.2%.\n\nBut to present it more accurately, I can use the fraction 429 / 216,580 or 5,148 / 2,598,960.\n\nAlternatively, I can provide the decimal approximation with more precision, such as 0.00198 or 0.198%.\n\nWait, actually, 429 / 216,580 is approximately 0.00198.\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.00198, or 0.198%.\n\nBut to express it in a more conventional way, perhaps I can say about 0.2%.\n\nAlternatively, it's common to express such probabilities in terms of odds.\n\nOdds are often expressed as \"1 in x\".\n\n\nSo, 0.00198 is approximately 1 in 504.\n\nBecause 1 / 0.00198 \u2248 504.\n\nSo, the odds are about 1 in 504.\n\nThat seems like a reasonable way to express it.\n\nAlternatively, in probability terms, it's about 0.2%.\n\nNow, to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the probability step by step, considering the suit of each card drawn.\n\nFirst card: can be any suit, so probability 1.\n\nSecond card: must match the suit of the first card. There are 12 cards left of that suit out of 51 remaining cards, so probability 12/51.\n\nThird card: must match the suit of the first card. Now, 11 cards of that suit out of 50 remaining cards, so 11/50.\n\nFourth card: 10 cards of that suit out of 49 remaining cards, so 10/49.\n\nFifth card: 9 cards of that suit out of 48 remaining cards, so 9/48.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is:\n\n1 \u00d7 (12/51) \u00d7 (11/50) \u00d7 (10/49) \u00d7 (9/48).\n\nCalculating this:\n\nFirst, (12/51) = 12/51 = 4/17.\n\nThen, (4/17) \u00d7 (11/50) = 44/850 = 22/425.\n\nNext, (22/425) \u00d7 (10/49) = 220/20,875 = 44/4,175.\n\nFinally, (44/4,175) \u00d7 (9/48) = 396/200,400 = 33/16,700.\n\nWhich simplifies to 33/16,700, which is approximately 0.001976, or 0.1976%.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the probability is approximately 0.2%.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it more precisely, I can leave it as the fraction 429 / 216,580.\n\nBut for practical purposes, 0.2% or 1 in 504 are acceptable approximations.\n\nIt's worth noting that in actual poker games, the probability of getting a flush is slightly different because straight flushes are excluded from flushes.\n\nBut in this general problem, since it just says \"a flush\", I think it's acceptable to consider both approaches.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I'll consider the exclusion of straight flushes.\n\nAs calculated earlier, the number of straight flushes is 40 (including royal flushes).\n\nTherefore, the number of pure flushes is 5,148 - 40 = 5,108.\n\nThus, the probability of getting a pure flush is 5,108 / 2,598,960.\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n5,108 \u00f7 4 = 1,277\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 4 = 649,740\n\nSo, 1,277 / 649,740.\n\nThis fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\nConverting to decimal:\n\n1,277 \u00f7 649,740 \u2248 0.001965.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.001965, or 0.1965%.\n\nWhich is still roughly 0.2%.\n\nSo, whether or not we exclude straight flushes, the probability remains approximately the same for practical purposes.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the probability of drawing a flush (all five cards of the same suit) from a standard deck of 52 cards without replacement is approximately 0.2%, or 1 in 504.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.00198} \\]"
