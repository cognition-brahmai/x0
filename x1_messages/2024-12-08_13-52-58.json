        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual revenue of $1,000,000. The cost of goods sold is 55% of the revenue, and the operating expenses are 30% of the revenue. I need to find out the company's net income.\n\nFirst, I should understand what net income is. Net income is generally calculated by subtracting all expenses from the total revenue. In this case, the main expenses are the cost of goods sold and the operating expenses.\n\nSo, the formula for net income here would be:\n\nNet Income = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses\n\nGiven that:\n\nRevenue = $1,000,000\n\nCost of Goods Sold = 55% of Revenue\n\nOperating Expenses = 30% of Revenue\n\nLet me calculate the Cost of Goods Sold:\n\nCost of Goods Sold = 55% of $1,000,000 = 0.55 * $1,000,000 = $550,000\n\nNext, the Operating Expenses:\n\nOperating Expenses = 30% of $1,000,000 = 0.30 * $1,000,000 = $300,000\n\nNow, plug these values into the net income formula:\n\nNet Income = $1,000,000 - $550,000 - $300,000 = $150,000\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Maybe I should consider if there are any other expenses that might be involved in calculating net income. For example, are there taxes or any other deductions that should be considered?\n\nIn a simple scenario, net income is revenue minus all expenses, which in this case seem to be only cost of goods sold and operating expenses. But in reality, companies have other expenses like taxes, interests, etc. However, since they are not mentioned here, I'll assume that the only expenses are cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the net income would be $150,000.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nRevenue: $1,000,000\n\nCost of Goods Sold: 55% of $1,000,000 = $550,000\n\nOperating Expenses: 30% of $1,000,000 = $300,000\n\nTotal Expenses: $550,000 + $300,000 = $850,000\n\nNet Income: $1,000,000 - $850,000 = $150,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages.\n\nTotal expenses as a percentage of revenue: 55% (COGS) + 30% (Operating Expenses) = 85%\n\nTherefore, net income is revenue minus total expenses: 100% - 85% = 15% of revenue\n\n15% of $1,000,000 is indeed $150,000.\n\nSo, the company's net income is $150,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]"
