        "content": "Let's see. So we have two trains here, one leaving Station A at 8 am going towards Station B at 60 mph, and another leaving Station B at 9 am going towards Station A at 90 mph. The distance between the stations is 450 miles, and we need to find out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how far each train has traveled by the time they meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up, which might help in calculating the time.\n\nBut wait, the second train leaves an hour later. So, from 8 am to 9 am, only the first train is moving. Let me calculate how far the first train travels in that one hour.\n\nTrain from A: 60 mph for 1 hour = 60 miles.\n\nSo, by 9 am, the first train has already covered 60 miles, meaning the remaining distance between the two trains is 450 - 60 = 390 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, starting at 9 am. The combined speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nTo cover 390 miles at 150 mph, the time taken would be distance divided by speed, so 390 / 150 = 2.6 hours.\n\n2.6 hours is 2 hours and 0.6 of an hour. Since 0.6 hours is 0.6 * 60 = 36 minutes, the total time is 2 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nSo, if they start moving towards each other at 9 am, they will meet at 9 am + 2 hours 36 minutes = 11:36 am.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is indeed the sum of their speeds, which is 150 mph.\n\nBut before 9 am, only one train is moving. So, from 8 am to 9 am, the first train covers 60 miles, reducing the distance to 390 miles.\n\nThen, at 9 am, both trains are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 150 mph, so time to cover 390 miles is 390 / 150 = 2.6 hours, which is 2 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nAdding that to 9 am indeed gives 11:36 am.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up an equation with time as a variable.\n\nLet\u2019s let t be the time in hours after 9 am when they meet.\n\nSo, the first train has been traveling for t + 1 hours (since it left at 8 am), and the second train has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the first train is 60(t + 1) miles, and the distance covered by the second train is 90t miles.\n\nThe sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the stations, which is 450 miles.\n\nSo, 60(t + 1) + 90t = 450.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for t:\n\n60t + 60 + 90t = 450\n\n150t + 60 = 450\n\n150t = 450 - 60\n\n150t = 390\n\nt = 390 / 150\n\nt = 2.6 hours, which again is 2 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nSo, starting from 9 am, adding 2 hours and 36 minutes brings us to 11:36 am.\n\nI think this is correct, but to be absolutely sure, let\u2019s check the distances each train has traveled by 11:36 am.\n\nFirst train:\n\nTime traveled: from 8 am to 11:36 am is 3 hours 36 minutes, which is 3.6 hours.\n\nDistance = 60 mph * 3.6 hours = 216 miles.\n\nSecond train:\n\nTime traveled: from 9 am to 11:36 am is 2 hours 36 minutes, which is 2.6 hours.\n\nDistance = 90 mph * 2.6 hours = 234 miles.\n\nTotal distance covered: 216 + 234 = 450 miles, which matches the distance between the stations.\n\nPerfect, it checks out.\n\nSo, the trains will meet at 11:36 am.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11:36\\ \\text{am}} \\]"
