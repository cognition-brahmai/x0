        "content": "Let's see. There's this riddle about a board game that's played all over the world, with a board that has black and white squares. It sounds like it's a game that requires strategy, not physical strength. Hmm, that narrows it down quite a bit.\n\nFirst, thinking about games that are played worldwide, there are quite a few board games that fit that description. Chess comes to mind immediately, but also games like checkers, Go, and maybe even some modern board games that have gained international popularity.\n\nNow, the mention of black and white squares specifically points towards a board that has these colors. Chess has a board with alternating black and white squares, as does checkers. Go, on the other hand, typically has a grid of 19x19 lines, with the intersections being the playing places, and the pieces are black and white stones, but the board itself isn't made of squares in the same way.\n\nSo, between chess and checkers, both have boards with black and white squares. But the riddle mentions that it involves a strategic fight, yet no physical strength or might. Both chess and checkers are strategic games that don't require physical strength, so that part applies to both.\n\nHowever, chess is often considered more strategic and is played worldwide, just like checkers. But I think chess is more renowned for its strategic depth, which might make it a better fit for the riddle.\n\nAdditionally, chess is widely recognized and has a huge global following, with international tournaments and a rich history. Checkers is also played worldwide, but perhaps not to the same extent as chess.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"strategic fight\" might lean more towards chess, as it involves planning, anticipating your opponent's moves, and developing a strategic position on the board. Checkers also requires strategy, but it might be seen as less complex compared to chess.\n\nSo, putting all these clues together, I'm going to guess that the answer to the riddle is chess.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{chess}} \\]"
