Built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair), it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has since become a beloved part of Paris's skyline. The Eiffel Tower stands at over 300 meters tall and offers breathtaking views of the city. It's amazing how it has become such an integral part of French culture and identity."
