        "content": "So the train goes from station A to station B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours for that journey. That means the distance between A and B is speed multiplied by time, right? So, 60 miles per hour times 2 hours equals 120 miles. Alright, so A and B are 120 miles apart.\n\nNow, there's a station C that's halfway between A and B. Halfway would mean it's 60 miles from A and 60 miles from B. The train makes a stop for 30 minutes at station C.\n\nSo, normally, without any stops, it takes 2 hours to go from A to B. But with a 30-minute stop at C, we need to add that stop time to the total travel time.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the travel time without stops. At 60 miles per hour, covering 120 miles should indeed take 2 hours.\n\nNow, since the train stops for 30 minutes at station C, we need to add that stop time to the total travel time.\n\nSo, total time = travel time from A to B + stop time at C.\n\nTravel time is 2 hours, stop time is 30 minutes.\n\nConverting 30 minutes to hours, it's 0.5 hours.\n\nSo, total time = 2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, we can keep it in hours and minutes: 2 hours plus 30 minutes equals 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut I think the question might expect the answer in hours.\n\nSo, 2.5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check.\n\nIs there anything else to consider? Is the stop time already included in the 2-hour journey time?\n\nWait, the problem says it takes 2 hours to travel from A to B, which is the travel time without stops. Then, it mentions a stop for 30 minutes at station C.\n\nSo, indeed, we need to add the stop time to the travel time.\n\nTherefore, total time = 2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the train's schedule includes the stop time, but the problem seems to indicate that the 2 hours is just the travel time, excluding stops.\n\nSo, adding the stop time makes sense.\n\nWait, another way to think about it:\n\nFrom A to C is 60 miles at 60 mph, so 1 hour.\n\nThen, stop for 30 minutes at C.\n\nThen, from C to B is another 60 miles at 60 mph, so another hour.\n\nTotal time = 1 hour (A to C) + 0.5 hours (stop at C) + 1 hour (C to B) = 2.5 hours.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total time to travel from A to B, including the stop, is 2.5 hours.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
