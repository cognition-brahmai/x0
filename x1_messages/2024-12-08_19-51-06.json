        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how much revenue is generated by each product per day, and then we can calculate the total revenue for both products over 15 days.\n\nSo, the factory produces 500 units of product A each day, and each unit sells for $20. To find the daily revenue from product A, we multiply the number of units by the price per unit:\n\n500 units * $20/unit = $10,000\n\nSimilarly, for product B, the factory produces 300 units each day, and each unit sells for $30. So, the daily revenue from product B is:\n\n300 units * $30/unit = $9,000\n\nNow, to find the total daily revenue from both products, we add the revenues together:\n\n$10,000 (from A) + $9,000 (from B) = $19,000 per day\n\nNext, we need to find out the revenue over 15 days. So, we multiply the daily total revenue by 15:\n\n$19,000/day * 15 days = $285,000\n\nTherefore, the combined revenue generated by both products after 15 days is $285,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{285000} \\]"
