        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are initially left-handed in the class.\n\nGiven that there are 40 students in total and 25% of them are left-handed, we can calculate the number of left-handed students as follows:\n\nNumber of left-handed students = 25% of 40\n\nTo find 25% of 40, we can multiply 40 by 0.25:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 40 = 10\n\nSo, there are initially 10 left-handed students in the class.\n\nNow, the problem states that 3 more students become left-handed. Therefore, we need to add these 3 students to the initial 10 left-handed students:\n\nNew number of left-handed students = 10 + 3 = 13\n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage of the class is now left-handed. The total number of students in the class remains 40.\n\nTo find the percentage, we use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (part/whole) \u00d7 100\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of left-handed students (13), and the \"whole\" is the total number of students (40).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage = (13/40) \u00d7 100\n\nFirst, we divide 13 by 40:\n\n13 \u00f7 40 = 0.325\n\nThen, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.325 \u00d7 100 = 32.5%\n\nTherefore, after 3 more students become left-handed, 32.5% of the class will be left-handed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32.5\\%} \\]"
