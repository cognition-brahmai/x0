        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company makes two products, A and B. Product A needs 5 units of raw material, and product B needs 8 units. They've got 2000 units of raw material in total. They want to maximize their production while using all the raw materials. I need to figure out how many units of each product they can make.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"maximize their production\" means. Does it mean maximize the total number of products, regardless of A or B, or is there a difference in profit or some other factor depending on which product they make? The problem doesn't specify any difference in value between A and B, so maybe it's just about making as many products as possible, period.\n\nLet me assume that the goal is to maximize the total number of products, A plus B, using all 2000 units of raw material.\n\nSo, if I let x be the number of product A and y be the number of product B, then the total raw material used would be 5x + 8y, and this needs to equal 2000 because they want to use all the available raw material.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n5x + 8y = 2000\n\nAnd the goal is to maximize x + y.\n\nThis seems like a linear programming problem, but since it's just two variables, maybe I can solve it algebraically.\n\nI need to express one variable in terms of the other using the constraint equation and then substitute into the objective function.\n\nLet me solve for y in terms of x from the constraint:\n\n5x + 8y = 2000\n\n8y = 2000 - 5x\n\ny = (2000 - 5x)/8\n\nNow, since y has to be a whole number (you can't make a fraction of a product), (2000 - 5x) must be divisible by 8.\n\nSimilarly, x has to be a whole number.\n\nSo, I need to find integer values of x and y such that 5x + 8y = 2000, and x + y is maximized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about this in terms of minimizing cost or something, but I think the algebraic approach is straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the objective function:\n\nz = x + y\n\nSubstitute y from above:\n\nz = x + (2000 - 5x)/8\n\nz = x + 2000/8 - (5x)/8\n\nz = x - (5x)/8 + 250\n\nz = (8x - 5x)/8 + 250\n\nz = (3x)/8 + 250\n\nNow, to maximize z, I need to maximize (3x)/8, which means maximizing x.\n\nBut x is limited by the raw material constraint.\n\nFrom 5x + 8y = 2000, if I set y = 0, then 5x = 2000, so x = 400.\n\nSimilarly, if x = 0, then 8y = 2000, so y = 250.\n\nSo, the possible extremes are x = 400, y = 0, or x = 0, y = 250.\n\nBut I need to maximize x + y.\n\nIf x = 400, y = 0, then z = 400 + 0 = 400.\n\nIf x = 0, y = 250, then z = 0 + 250 = 250.\n\nSo, x = 400, y = 0 gives a higher total production.\n\nBut maybe there's a combination of x and y that gives a higher z than 400.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSuppose I make x = 400 - t, and see what y becomes.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that for every unit increase in y, x decreases by a certain amount.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of raw material per product.\n\nProduct A uses 5 units, product B uses 8 units.\n\nSo, product A is more material-efficient: fewer units of material per product.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the total number of products, I should make as many of product A as possible, since it uses less material per unit.\n\nSo, if I make only product A, x = 400, y = 0, z = 400.\n\nIf I make only product B, x = 0, y = 250, z = 250.\n\nIf I make a combination, say x = 392, then 5*392 = 1960, leaving 40 units for y, but 8 doesn't divide 40 evenly. 40 / 8 = 5, so y = 5.\n\nSo, z = 392 + 5 = 397, which is less than 400.\n\nAlternatively, x = 384, 5*384 = 1920, leaving 80 units for y, y = 10.\n\nZ = 384 + 10 = 394, still less than 400.\n\nX = 376, 5*376 = 1880, leaving 120 units for y, y = 15.\n\nZ = 376 + 15 = 391.\n\nPattern here: as x decreases by 8, y increases by 5, and z decreases by 3.\n\nWait, 397, 394, 391, etc.\n\nSo, it seems that z decreases as y increases.\n\nTherefore, the maximum z occurs when y = 0, x = 400.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a combination where z is higher than 400.\n\nSuppose x = 396, 5*396 = 1980, leaving 20 units for y, which isn't divisible by 8.\n\n20 / 8 = 2.5, which isn't allowed.\n\nX = 396 isn't feasible.\n\nX = 392, as above.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the objective function z = x + y, and the constraint 5x + 8y = 2000.\n\nI can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill for this situation.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y have to be integers, this is an integer linear programming problem.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me consider the opportunity cost.\n\nIf I swap one unit of x for y, I lose 5 units of material and gain 8 for y, but I need to keep the total material constant at 2000.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the rate at which x can be traded for y.\n\nIf I decrease x by 8 units, I free up 5*8 = 40 units of material, which can be used to make 40 / 8 = 5 units of y.\n\nSo, decreasing x by 8 and increasing y by 5 keeps the material constant.\n\nNow, what happens to z?\n\nZ = x + y.\n\nNew z = (x - 8) + (y + 5) = z - 3.\n\nSo, z decreases by 3.\n\nTherefore, any deviation from the x-only production reduces the total production.\n\nTherefore, the maximum z occurs when y = 0 and x = 400.\n\nAlternatively, if there is a higher value for z, it would have been achieved by some combination, but since every such combination reduces z by 3, it's not beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the maximum total production is 400 units of product A and 0 units of product B.\n\nBut let me check if there's a way to make z higher than 400.\n\nSuppose I set y = 1, then 8*1 = 8 units used, leaving 1992 units for x.\n\nX = 1992 / 5 = 398.4, which isn't integer.\n\nX has to be integer, so not feasible.\n\nY = 2, 8*2 = 16, leaving 1984 for x.\n\nX = 1984 / 5 = 396.8, not integer.\n\nY = 3, 8*3 = 24, leaving 1976 for x.\n\nX = 1976 / 5 = 395.2, not integer.\n\nY = 4, 8*4 = 32, leaving 1968 for x.\n\nX = 1968 / 5 = 393.6, not integer.\n\nY = 5, 8*5 = 40, leaving 1960 for x.\n\nX = 1960 / 5 = 392, integer.\n\nSo, x = 392, y = 5, z = 397.\n\nStill less than 400.\n\nSimilarly, y = 10, x = 384, z = 394.\n\nAgain less.\n\nY = 15, x = 376, z = 391.\n\nStill less.\n\nY = 20, x = 368, z = 388.\n\nLess.\n\nY = 25, x = 360, z = 385.\n\nLess.\n\nThis pattern continues until y = 250, x = 0, z = 250.\n\nSo, indeed, z decreases as y increases from 0.\n\nTherefore, the maximum z occurs at x = 400, y = 0.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination where z is higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my assumption that z decreases with increasing y.\n\nLet me check another combination.\n\nSuppose y = 100, then 8*100 = 800, leaving 1200 for x.\n\nX = 1200 / 5 = 240.\n\nZ = 240 + 100 = 340, which is less than 400.\n\nAnother combination: y = 50, 8*50 = 400, leaving 1600 for x.\n\nX = 1600 / 5 = 320.\n\nZ = 320 + 50 = 370, still less than 400.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to make z higher by making y negative, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nOr making x negative, which also doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, it seems that the maximum total production is achieved by producing only product A, 400 units, and no product B.\n\nBut let me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the company wants to maximize the total number of products, and they have to use all the raw material.\n\nIs there a way to use all 2000 units and make more than 400 products?\n\nWell, if they make only A, they make 400 products.\n\nIf they make only B, they make 250 products.\n\nAny combination in between will result in a total number of products less than 400, as per the earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, the maximum total production is 400 units of A and 0 units of B.\n\nBut the problem says \"how many units of each product can they produce if they want to maximize their production while using all the available raw materials?\"\n\nSo, the answer is 400 units of A and 0 units of B.\n\nAlternatively, if they want to produce some units of B, they can, but it will reduce the total number of products.\n\nFor example, if they produce 100 units of B, they use 800 units of material, leaving 1200 for A, which allows 240 units of A, for a total of 340 products.\n\nWhich is less than 400.\n\nSo, to maximize total production while using all raw materials, they should produce only product A, 400 units, and no product B.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to use all the material and make more than 400 products by producing both A and B.\n\nLet me see.\n\nSuppose they produce x units of A and y units of B, such that 5x + 8y = 2000.\n\nI need to maximize x + y.\n\nLet me solve for x in terms of y:\n\n5x = 2000 - 8y\n\nX = (2000 - 8y)/5\n\nFor x to be integer, 2000 - 8y must be divisible by 5.\n\nSimilarly, y must be such that 2000 - 8y is divisible by 5.\n\nLet me find y such that 2000 - 8y is divisible by 5.\n\n2000 is divisible by 5, 8y must also be considered modulo 5.\n\n8 mod 5 = 3, so 8y mod 5 = 3y mod 5.\n\nFor 2000 - 8y to be divisible by 5, 3y must be divisible by 5, meaning y must be a multiple of 5/ gcd(3,5), but gcd(3,5) = 1, so y must be a multiple of 5/1 = 5.\n\nWait, more carefully:\n\nWe have 2000 - 8y divisible by 5.\n\n2000 is divisible by 5, 8y must be such that 8y mod 5 = 0.\n\n8 mod 5 = 3, so 3y mod 5 = 0.\n\nTherefore, 3y is divisible by 5.\n\nSince 3 and 5 are coprime, y must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo, y must be a multiple of 5.\n\nSimilarly, from x = (2000 - 8y)/5, since x must be integer, and 2000 - 8y is divisible by 5, y must be a multiple of 5.\n\nSo, y can be 0, 5, 10, 15, ..., up to y = 250.\n\nNow, for each y that is a multiple of 5, x is integer.\n\nNow, z = x + y = (2000 - 8y)/5 + y = (2000 - 8y + 5y)/5 = (2000 - 3y)/5.\n\nSo, z = (2000 - 3y)/5.\n\nNow, to maximize z, I need to maximize (2000 - 3y)/5.\n\nThis is a decreasing function of y, since -3 is negative.\n\nTherefore, z decreases as y increases.\n\nTherefore, the maximum z occurs at the smallest y, which is y = 0.\n\nThen, x = (2000 - 0)/5 = 400, and z = 400 + 0 = 400.\n\nAny increase in y reduces z.\n\nFor example, y = 5, x = (2000 - 40)/5 = 1960/5 = 392, z = 392 + 5 = 397.\n\nY = 10, x = (2000 - 80)/5 = 1920/5 = 384, z = 384 + 10 = 394.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTherefore, the maximum total production is 400 units of A and 0 units of B.\n\nAlternatively, if the company insists on producing some units of B, they can, but it will reduce the total production.\n\nFor example, if they produce y = 50 units of B, then x = (2000 - 400)/5 = 1600/5 = 320, z = 320 + 50 = 370.\n\nStill less than 400.\n\nSimilarly, y = 100, x = (2000 - 800)/5 = 1200/5 = 240, z = 240 + 100 = 340.\n\nLess than 400.\n\nTherefore, to maximize total production while using all raw materials, they should produce only product A, 400 units, and no product B.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to use all the material and make more than 400 products by producing both A and B.\n\nWait a minute, let's think about this differently.\n\nSuppose they produce a certain number of A and B such that the total material used is 2000 units, and the total number of products is maximized.\n\nWe've seen that z = (2000 - 3y)/5.\n\nTo maximize z, minimize y, which is y = 0, giving z = 400.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to interpret the problem differently.\n\nMaybe the company wants to maximize the production of A and B individually, but the problem says \"maximize their production while using all the available raw materials.\"\n\n\"their production\" likely refers to the total production, A plus B.\n\nUnless there's a different objective, such as maximizing profit, but since no mention of profit is made, I think total production is the goal.\n\nTherefore, producing only A maximizes z.\n\nAlternatively, if there were different profits associated with A and B, the optimal mix might be different.\n\nBut in this case, it's just about total production.\n\nSo, the answer is 400 units of A and 0 units of B.\n\nBut maybe to confirm, let's consider the general case.\n\nSuppose the company produces x units of A and y units of B, with 5x + 8y = 2000.\n\nWe can plot this as a line in the xy-plane.\n\nThe intercepts are (400,0) and (0,250).\n\nAny point on this line represents a combination where all raw material is used.\n\nThe objective is to maximize z = x + y.\n\nThis is a linear function, and the maximum will occur at one of the endpoints of the feasible region.\n\nIn this case, the endpoints are (400,0) and (0,250).\n\nAt (400,0), z = 400.\n\nAt (0,250), z = 250.\n\nTherefore, the maximum z is 400 at (400,0).\n\nHence, producing only product A maximizes the total production while using all raw materials.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400 \\text{ units of product A and } 0 \\text{ units of product B}} \\]"
