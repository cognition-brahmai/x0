        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a group of people donates money to a charity. The average donation amount is $50, and the total amount donated is $2,500. I need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nOkay, so I know that the average donation is $50, and the total donation is $2,500. I need to find the number of people.\n\nI remember that the average is calculated by dividing the total amount by the number of items, right? In this case, the average donation is the total donation divided by the number of people.\n\nSo, average donation = total donation / number of people.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, if I have the average and the total, I can rearrange this formula to solve for the number of people.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of people = total donation / average donation.\n\nAlright, plugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of people = $2,500 / $50.\n\nLet me do the division.\n\n2,500 divided by 50.\n\nWell, 50 times 50 is 2,500.\n\nSo, 50 x 50 = 2,500.\n\nTherefore, the number of people is 50.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf 50 people each donate $50, then the total would be $2,500.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of multiplication.\n\nIf the average donation is $50 and there are n people, then the total donation is 50n.\n\nWe know the total donation is $2,500, so:\n\n50n = 2,500.\n\nTo find n, divide both sides by 50:\n\nn = 2,500 / 50.\n\nAgain, that's 50.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I should consider.\n\nIs there any possibility that the donations are not all equal to the average?\n\nWell, the problem says that the average donation is $50, but it doesn't specify that each person donated exactly $50.\n\nBut in calculating the average, it doesn't matter whether the donations are equal or not; the average is still the total divided by the number of donations.\n\nSo, my calculation should still hold.\n\nAlternatively, if there were different donation amounts, but the average is $50, the total would still be the average multiplied by the number of donors.\n\nWait, no, that's the same as what I did.\n\nSo, I think I'm on the right track.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nSuppose I think about it in terms of sums.\n\nLet\u2019s say there are n people, each donating an amount d_i, where i goes from 1 to n.\n\nThe average donation is (d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_n) / n = 50.\n\nAnd the total donation is d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_n = 2,500.\n\nSo, plugging into the average formula:\n\n2,500 / n = 50.\n\nThen, solving for n: n = 2,500 / 50 = 50.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI can also consider dimensional analysis.\n\nThe units should make sense.\n\nTotal donation is in dollars, average donation is in dollars per person.\n\nSo, total donation / average donation = dollars / (dollars per person) = people.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, $2,500 / $50 per person = 50 people.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways.\n\nI can also consider plugging the answer back into the original conditions to verify.\n\nIf there are 50 people, each donating $50, total donation is 50 * 50 = 2,500, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, the average donation would be 2,500 / 50 = 50, which matches the given average.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the number of people in the group is 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
