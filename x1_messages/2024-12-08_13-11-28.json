        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train's journey, and I need to find the average speed for the entire trip, including the stop. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours. That seems straightforward. Then it stops for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. After that, it travels another 150 miles in 3 hours. I need to consider all parts of this journey to calculate the average speed.\n\nI remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I should first find the total distance the train traveled and then divide it by the total time taken, including the stop.\n\nLet's calculate the total distance. The train went 100 miles and then 150 miles. So, total distance is 100 + 150 = 250 miles.\n\nNow, for the total time. It traveled for 2 hours, then stopped for 0.5 hours, and then traveled again for 3 hours. So, total time is 2 + 0.5 + 3 = 5.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the average speed should be total distance divided by total time, which is 250 miles divided by 5.5 hours.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 250 divided by 5.5.\n\nFirst, 5.5 times 45 is 247.5, which is less than 250. The difference is 250 - 247.5 = 2.5.\n\nSo, 45 miles per hour with a remainder of 2.5 miles. Now, 5.5 hours goes into 2.5 how many times? Let's see, 5.5 times 0.45 is about 2.475, which is close to 2.5.\n\nSo, overall, the average speed is approximately 45.45 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can be more precise. Let's try dividing 250 by 5.5 directly.\n\n250 divided by 5.5: I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal, so 250*2 = 500, and 5.5*2 = 11.\n\nNow, 500 divided by 11 is approximately 45.4545... repeating.\n\nSo, the average speed is about 45.45 miles per hour.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nTotal distance is indeed 250 miles.\n\nTotal time is 5.5 hours.\n\n250 divided by 5.5 should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in minutes to avoid decimals.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes, and 3 hours is 180 minutes. Total time is 120 + 30 + 180 = 330 minutes.\n\nTotal distance is still 250 miles.\n\nSo, average speed is 250 miles per 330 minutes. But usually, we express speed in miles per hour, so it's better to keep time in hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert 330 minutes to hours: 330 divided by 60 is 5.5 hours, which matches what I had before.\n\nSo, yes, average speed is 250 miles divided by 5.5 hours, which is approximately 45.45 miles per hour.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45.\\overline{45} \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
