Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, the powerful ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron that plays a central role in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is called the One Ring, also referred to as the Ruling Ring or the Great Ring of Power. This ring holds a significant place in the story as it possesses the power to control the other Rings of Power and, consequently, dominate the will of those who bear them or possess great influence over them. The primary narrative of \"The Lord of the Rings\" revolves around the quest to destroy the One Ring, as it is the only way to ensure that Sauron does not regain his full strength and bring about the destruction of Middle-earth."
