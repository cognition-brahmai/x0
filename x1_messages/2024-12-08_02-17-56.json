        "content": "So there are 10 people at this party, and each one knows exactly 3 other people there. We need to figure out how many handshakes happen if each pair of acquaintances shakes hands once.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 10 people, and each knows exactly 3 others. So, for example, person A knows persons B, C, and D; person B knows persons A, E, and F; and so on.\n\nEach handshake is between two people who know each other, and each pair shakes hands only once. So, we need to find the total number of such unique pairs.\n\nThis sounds like a graph theory problem, where people are vertices and handshakes are edges. Each vertex has a degree of 3, meaning each person knows 3 others.\n\nIn graph theory, the handshaking lemma states that the sum of all vertices' degrees is equal to twice the number of edges. That makes sense because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nSo, if I have 10 people, each knowing 3 others, the sum of degrees is 10 * 3 = 30.\n\nAccording to the handshaking lemma, this sum should be twice the number of edges (handshakes), so the number of handshakes is 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nWait, but is there any other way to think about this to confirm?\n\nAnother approach: since each person knows exactly 3 others, each person shakes hands with 3 people.\n\nBut if I just multiply 10 * 3, I'm counting each handshake twice (once for each participant), so dividing by 2 should give the correct number of unique handshakes.\n\nYes, that matches the previous result: 15 handshakes.\n\nIs there a way to visualize this?\n\nImagine plotting this as a graph with 10 nodes, each connected to exactly 3 others. The graph would be a 3-regular graph, also known as a cubic graph.\n\nFor 10 nodes, there are known cubic graphs, like the Petersen graph, which has 15 edges.\n\nWait, but I don't need to know about specific graphs; I just need to confirm the number of edges based on the degrees.\n\nSo, in general, for any graph where each of the n vertices has degree k, the number of edges is (n * k)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=10, k=3, so edges = (10*3)/2 = 15.\n\nTherefore, there are 15 handshakes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any double-counting or exceptions.\n\nSince the graph is undirected and each edge connects two vertices, with each edge being counted once, the formula should hold.\n\nAlso, since each person knows exactly 3 others, there are no multiple handshakes between the same pair.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is indeed 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
