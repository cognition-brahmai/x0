        "content": "So the factory produces 100 units every day, and these units are inspected by three inspectors: A, B, and C. Inspector A checks 40% of the units, Inspector B checks 35%, and Inspector C checks the rest. I need to find out how many units Inspector C inspects daily.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what percentage of the units Inspector C inspects. Since Inspector A does 40% and Inspector B does 35%, together they inspect 40% plus 35%, which is 75% of the units. That means Inspector C inspects the remaining percentage of the units. So, 100% minus 75% is 25%. Therefore, Inspector C inspects 25% of the units.\n\nNow, to find out how many units that is daily, I need to calculate 25% of 100 units. Well, 25% of 100 is straightforward: it's 25 units.\n\nSo, Inspector C inspects 25 units daily.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If Inspector A inspects 40% of 100 units, that's 40 units. Inspector B inspects 35% of 100, which is 35 units. Together, A and B inspect 40 plus 35, which is 75 units. Since the factory produces 100 units, the remaining units for Inspector C are 100 minus 75, which is indeed 25 units.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it directly by finding 25% of 100 units, which again is 25 units.\n\nSo, my answer is correct. Inspector C inspects 25 units daily.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
