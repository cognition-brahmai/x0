        "content": "So I have this problem: \"How many different ways can you arrange the letters in the word 'MATHEMATICS'?\" Okay, so I need to find out how many unique arrangements or permutations of the letters in \"MATHEMATICS\" there are.\n\nFirst, I know that if all the letters were unique, the number of arrangements would be the factorial of the number of letters. The word \"MATHEMATICS\" has 11 letters, so if they were all distinct, it would be 11! (11 factorial) ways to arrange them. But in this case, some letters are repeated: M appears twice, A appears twice, T appears twice, and the rest are unique.\n\nSo, I recall that for permutations of multiset items, the formula adjusts for the repetitions. The general formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n_k!}\n\\]\n\nwhere n is the total number of letters, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of the repeating letters.\n\nFor \"MATHEMATICS\":\n\n- Total letters, n = 11\n\n- M appears 2 times\n\n- A appears 2 times\n\n- T appears 2 times\n\n- H, E, I, C, S each appear 1 time\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11!}{2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n\n\\[\n2! = 2, \\quad \\text{so } 2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2! = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nAnd the 1! terms are all 1, so they don't change anything.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11!}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate 11!. Let's see:\n\n\\[\n11! = 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 39916800\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{39916800}{8} = 4989600\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculation.\n\nActually, 11! is indeed 39916800, and dividing by 8 would be 39916800 \u00f7 8 = 4989600.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's confirm if the formula is applied correctly. The formula for permutations of multiset items is correct, and I've accounted for the repetitions of M, A, and T.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step. If all letters were unique, there would be 11! arrangements. But since some letters are identical, we need to account for those repetitions.\n\nFor the M's, since there are two M's, every arrangement where the M's are swapped would be considered the same. So, we divide by 2! for the M's. Similarly, for the A's and T's, we divide by 2! for each.\n\nSo, yes, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct arrangements is indeed 11! divided by (2! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 2!) which is 4989600.\n\nWait, but let me verify the division:\n\n11! = 39916800\n\n2! = 2\n\nSo, 2! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 2! = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8\n\n39916800 \u00f7 8 = 4989600\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11!}{2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{39916800}{8} = 4989600\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of distinct arrangements is 4,989,600.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can calculate it differently. Let's see:\n\nFirst, choose positions for the M's. There are 11 positions, and we need to choose 2 for M's. The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 11 is C(11,2), which is:\n\n\\[\nC(11,2) = \\frac{11!}{2! \\cdot 9!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10}{2 \\times 1} = 55\n\\]\n\nThen, choose positions for the A's from the remaining 9 positions. C(9,2):\n\n\\[\nC(9,2) = \\frac{9!}{2! \\cdot 7!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, choose positions for the T's from the remaining 7 positions. C(7,2):\n\n\\[\nC(7,2) = \\frac{7!}{2! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\nFinally, the remaining 5 positions have unique letters (H, E, I, C, S), so they can be arranged in 5! ways:\n\n\\[\n5! = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements would be:\n\n\\[\n55 \\times 36 \\times 21 \\times 120\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that step by step:\n\nFirst, 55 \u00d7 36:\n\n\\[\n55 \\times 36 = 1980\n\\]\n\nThen, 1980 \u00d7 21:\n\n\\[\n1980 \\times 20 = 39600\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1980 \\times 1 = 1980\n\n\\]\n\n\\]\n\n39600 + 1980 = 41580\n\n\\]\n\nFinally, 41580 \u00d7 120:\n\n\\]\n\n41580 \u00d7 100 = 4158000\n\n\\]\n\n\\]\n\n41580 \u00d7 20 = 831600\n\n\\]\n\n\\]\n\n4158000 + 831600 = 4989600\n\n\\]\n\nSo, again, we get 4,989,600.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation using the multiset permutation formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the formula for permutations of multiset items, it's designed to handle exactly this kind of problem, where there are repeated items. So, applying that formula correctly gives the same result as this step-by-step approach.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in \"MATHEMATICS\" is 4,989,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4989600} \\]"
