Below is a PowerShell script that retrieves information about the current operating system, including the OS name, version, architecture, and installed RAM.\n\n```powershell\n# Get OS Name and Version\n$os = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem\n$osName = $os.Name\n$osVersion = $os.Version\n\n# Get OS Architecture\n$osArchitecture = $os.OSArchitecture\n\n# Get Installed RAM\n$totalVisibleMemorySize = $os.TotalVisibleMemorySize\n# Convert from KB to GB\n$totalMemoryGB = [math]::Round($totalVisibleMemorySize / 1MB, 2)\n\n# Output the information\nWrite-Output \"OS Name: $osName\"\nWrite-Output \"OS Version: $osVersion\"\nWrite-Output \"OS Architecture: $osArchitecture\"\nWrite-Output \"Installed RAM: $totalMemoryGB GB\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Get OS Name and Version:**\n   - `Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem` retrieves various properties of the operating system.\n   - `Name` and `Version` properties are used to get the OS name and version respectively.\n\n2. **Get OS Architecture:**\n   - `OSArchitecture` property provides the architecture (e.g., 64-bit).\n\n3. **Get Installed RAM:**\n   - `TotalVisibleMemorySize` property gives the total physical memory in KB.\n   - Convert KB to GB for better readability.\n\n4. **Output the Information:**\n   - Use `Write-Output` to display the retrieved information.\n\nYou can run this script in PowerShell to get the details about your operating system."
