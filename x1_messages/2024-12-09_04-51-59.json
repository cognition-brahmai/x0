According to recent data, Tokyo attracts around 10 million international tourists annually, while Rome welcomes approximately 10 million as well. So, it seems they are quite comparable in terms of international visitor numbers. However, it's worth noting that domestic tourism can significantly impact total visitor numbers, but since your question specifically asks about international tourists, these figures should give you a good idea. If you need more detailed information or have another question, feel free to ask!"
