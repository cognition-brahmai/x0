        "content": "Let's dive into this interesting problem about the bacteria doubling every hour. So, the scenario is that a petri dish is filled with bacteria after 6 hours, and the question is: when was the dish half full?\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the nature of the bacteria's growth. It's stated that the bacteria doubles every hour. That sounds like exponential growth, where the quantity increases by a constant factor at regular time intervals. In this case, the factor is 2, and the time interval is 1 hour.\n\nSo, if the petri dish is full at 6 hours, and the bacteria double every hour, that means that just one hour before, at 5 hours, the dish must have been half full. Because if it was half full at 5 hours, doubling in the next hour would fill it up to full at 6 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is it that straightforward? Let me think about this again. Exponential growth can be a bit counterintuitive sometimes.\n\nLet me try to model this mathematically. If the amount of bacteria at time t is B(t), and it doubles every hour, then B(t) = B(0) * 2^t, where B(0) is the initial amount of bacteria at time t=0.\n\nNow, the petri dish is filled at t=6 hours, so B(6) is the full capacity, let's call it C. Therefore, B(6) = B(0) * 2^6 = C.\n\nWe need to find the time t when the dish was half full, meaning B(t) = C/2.\n\nSo, B(t) = B(0) * 2^t = C/2.\n\nBut we know that B(6) = B(0) * 2^6 = C, so B(0) = C / 2^6.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation for B(t):\n\nB(t) = (C / 2^6) * 2^t = C/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n(C * 2^t) / 2^6 = C/2.\n\nDivide both sides by C:\n\n2^t / 2^6 = 1/2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2^(t-6) = 2^(-1).\n\nTherefore, t - 6 = -1, so t = 5.\n\nSo, according to this mathematical model, the dish was half full at t=5 hours.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this conclusion. For example, is there a possibility that the growth rate changes over time? The problem states that the bacteria double every hour, so presumably, the growth rate is constant.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the capacity of the petri dish. Maybe as the dish gets closer to full, the growth rate slows down due to limited resources or space. But the problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so I'll assume that the exponential growth continues until the dish is full.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dish wasn't empty at t=0. Maybe there was already some bacteria present at t=0. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's reasonable to assume that B(0) is a small initial amount.\n\nLet me think about another way to approach this. If the bacteria double every hour, then going backwards in time, the amount halves every hour.\n\nSo, at t=6 hours, the dish is full.\n\nAt t=5 hours, it was half full.\n\nAt t=4 hours, it was a quarter full.\n\nAt t=3 hours, an eighth full, and so on.\n\nThis seems consistent with the mathematical model I used earlier.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the possibility of lag time or any other growth factors. However, given the information provided, I don't think that's necessary.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the dish doesn't fill up completely until the last doubling. Meaning, at t=5 hours, it's almost full, but not quite, and only at t=6 does it reach full capacity. But that wouldn't align with the doubling every hour assumption.\n\nWait, actually, in exponential growth, the increment is proportional to the current amount. So, if it doubles every hour, then each hour it adds an amount equal to what was already there at the beginning of the hour.\n\nSo, if at t=5 hours, the dish is half full, then in the next hour, it doubles, meaning it adds another half, making it full at t=6 hours.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dish was half full at t=5 hours, and then in the sixth hour, it doubled again to be full at t=6 hours.\n\nWait, that's the same as what I just said.\n\nI think I'm converging on the same conclusion.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose the petri dish is full at t=6 hours, and the bacteria double every hour. If I consider the growth backwards, halving each hour, then at t=5 hours, it's half full, at t=4 hours, a quarter full, and so on.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for exponential growth that can be applied here.\n\nThe general formula for exponential growth is:\n\nB(t) = B(0) * e^(kt),\n\nwhere k is the growth rate.\n\nBut in this case, since it doubles every hour, it's more convenient to use the formula I used earlier: B(t) = B(0) * 2^t.\n\nYes, that seems appropriate.\n\nSo, based on that, the dish was half full at t=5 hours.\n\nBut let's consider if there might be other interpretations of the problem.\n\nFor example, maybe the petri dish has a limited capacity, and the bacteria growth follows a logistic growth model, where growth slows down as it approaches capacity.\n\nIn that case, the growth isn't exactly exponential throughout, but rather, it follows the logistic curve, which levels off as it reaches the carrying capacity.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the bacteria double every hour, which suggests exponential growth, not logistic growth.\n\nUnless the dish being full at t=6 hours indicates that the carrying capacity has been reached, and growth starts to slow down.\n\nBut according to the problem, it's filled after 6 hours, implying that before that, it was exponentially growing.\n\nSo, perhaps for the first 6 hours, it's exponential growth, and at t=6 hours, it reaches full capacity.\n\nIn that case, my initial conclusion stands: it was half full at t=5 hours.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the doubling time changes as the bacteria density increases, but the problem says it doubles every hour, so I think that's a constant doubling time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the petri dish wasn't empty at t=0, but had some initial amount of bacteria.\n\nIf that's the case, then the time at which it was half full would shift accordingly.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the initial conditions, I think it's reasonable to assume that B(0) is a small initial amount, and the dish becomes significant only after several hours of growth.\n\nBut even if there were some bacteria present at t=0, the doubling every hour would still hold, so the relative progression would be the same.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that it was half full at t=5 hours remains valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dish has a constant rate of bacteria removal or death, but again, the problem doesn't mention that, so I'll assume pure exponential growth.\n\nAnother consideration: maybe the petri dish has a limited surface area, and as the bacteria cover more area, the growth rate changes.\n\nBut again, the problem states that it doubles every hour, suggesting that for the duration in question, the growth rate remains constant.\n\nTherefore, I think the simplest and most straightforward answer is that the dish was half full at t=5 hours.\n\nTo summarize, based on the exponential growth model where the bacteria double every hour, and assuming that the dish is full at t=6 hours, it must have been half full at t=5 hours.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by both the mathematical model and the logical reasoning of exponential growth.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is that the petri dish was half full at 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
