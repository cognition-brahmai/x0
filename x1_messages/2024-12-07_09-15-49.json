Mike takes care of the lions, Nancy looks after the giraffes, and Olivia is responsible for the elephants. One day, the head zookeeper asked them to switch animals for a week as part of a training exercise. During this time, Mike noticed that one of the elephants seemed unwell but didn't inform anyone. Later, when Olivia returned to her original duty, she discovered the sick elephant. What does Olivia think about Mike's observation skills?"

For example, Olivia might appreciate Mike's attention to detail in noticing the sick elephant, even if he didn't report it immediately. Alternatively, she might be concerned about why Mike didn't inform anyone about the elephant's condition. It's also possible that Olivia could feel responsible for the oversight, given that she is the primary caretaker for the elephants. How do you think Olivia would react in this situation?"
