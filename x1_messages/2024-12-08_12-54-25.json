        "content": "Let's see. So, the store is offering a discount where the price decreases by 20% each week, and the original price is $100. I need to find out what the price will be after 3 weeks.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 20% discount means. A 20% discount means that each week, the price is reduced by 20% of its current value. So, each week, the price is 80% of what it was the previous week.\n\nLet me break it down week by week.\n\nWeek 1:\n\nStart with $100.\n\nDiscount: 20% of $100 = 0.20 * 100 = $20.\n\nSo, the price after Week 1: $100 - $20 = $80.\n\nAlternatively, since it's 80% of the original price: 0.80 * $100 = $80.\n\nWeek 2:\n\nNow, the price is $80.\n\nDiscount: 20% of $80 = 0.20 * 80 = $16.\n\nSo, the price after Week 2: $80 - $16 = $64.\n\nOr, 80% of $80: 0.80 * $80 = $64.\n\nWeek 3:\n\nNow, the price is $64.\n\nDiscount: 20% of $64 = 0.20 * 64 = $12.80.\n\nSo, the price after Week 3: $64 - $12.80 = $51.20.\n\nAlternatively, 80% of $64: 0.80 * $64 = $51.20.\n\nSo, after 3 weeks, the price will be $51.20.\n\nIs there a faster way to calculate this without doing it week by week?\n\nYes, I think there is. Since the price is reduced by 20% each week, it's like multiplying the price by 0.80 each week.\n\nSo, after 3 weeks, the price would be the original price multiplied by 0.80 three times.\n\nThat is: $100 * (0.80)^3.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 0.80^3 = 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80.\n\n0.80 * 0.80 = 0.64.\n\n0.64 * 0.80 = 0.512.\n\nSo, $100 * 0.512 = $51.20.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by calculating week by week.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result: $51.20.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about it differently.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each week, the price is decreasing by 20%, which means it's retaining 80% of its value from the previous week.\n\nSo, after 3 weeks, it should be 80% of 80% of 80% of the original price.\n\nWhich is indeed 0.80^3 * original price.\n\nSo, $100 * 0.80^3 = $100 * 0.512 = $51.20.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the total discount is 20% + 20% + 20% = 60%, and then thought the final price is $100 - $60 = $40, that would be incorrect because discounts are applied successively, not additively in this case.\n\nBecause each week the discount is applied to the remaining price, not the original price.\n\nSo, it's important to apply the discount successively.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for exponential decay, since the price is decreasing by a constant percentage each week.\n\nThe formula for the final amount in exponential decay is:\n\nFinal amount = initial amount * (1 - rate)^time.\n\nIn this case, the rate is 20%, or 0.20, and time is 3 weeks.\n\nSo, final price = $100 * (1 - 0.20)^3 = $100 * (0.80)^3 = $100 * 0.512 = $51.20.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with $51.20 as the price after 3 weeks.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{51.20} \\]\n"
