        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of widgets: type X and type Y. The profit for each type X widget is $10, and for type Y, it's $15. The store sold a total of 120 widgets and made a total profit of $1600. We need to find out how many of each type were sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of type X widgets as x and the number of type Y widgets as y.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of widgets sold is 120.\n\n2. The total profit from selling these widgets is $1600.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. x + y = 120 (since the total number of widgets is 120)\n\n2. 10x + 15y = 1600 (since the profit from type X is $10 each and from type Y is $15 each, and the total profit is $1600)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of x and y.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\nx + y = 120 ...(1)\n\n10x + 15y = 1600 ...(2)\n\nI think the easiest way to solve this is by using the substitution or elimination method. I'll go with the elimination method because it seems straightforward here.\n\nFirst, I can simplify equation (2) by dividing all terms by 5 to make the numbers smaller:\n\n10x/5 + 15y/5 = 1600/5\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2x + 3y = 320 ...(2a)\n\nNow, I have:\n\nx + y = 120 ...(1)\n\n2x + 3y = 320 ...(2a)\n\nI can eliminate one of the variables by making the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate x.\n\nTo do that, I can multiply equation (1) by 2:\n\n2(x + y) = 2(120)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n2x + 2y = 240 ...(1a)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n2x + 2y = 240 ...(1a)\n\n2x + 3y = 320 ...(2a)\n\nNext, I'll subtract equation (1a) from equation (2a):\n\n(2x + 3y) - (2x + 2y) = 320 - 240\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x + 3y - 2x - 2y = 80\n\nWhich further simplifies to:\n\ny = 80\n\nAlright, so we have y = 80. That means 80 type Y widgets were sold.\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into equation (1) to find x.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nx + y = 120\n\nSubstitute y = 80:\n\nx + 80 = 120\n\nSubtract 80 from both sides:\n\nx = 40\n\nSo, 40 type X widgets were sold.\n\nLet me just double-check these values to make sure they make sense.\n\nFirst, total widgets: 40 + 80 = 120. That checks out.\n\nNext, total profit: (40 * 10) + (80 * 15) = 400 + 1200 = 1600. That also matches the given total profit.\n\nLooks like we've got the correct answer. So, the store sold 40 type X widgets and 80 type Y widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ type X widgets and } 80 \\text{ type Y widgets}} \\]"
