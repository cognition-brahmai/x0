        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a beach house rental that costs $2,000, and a group of friends wants to split this cost equally among themselves. Each person shouldn't pay more than $150. We need to figure out how many people are needed to keep each person's share at or below $150.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up an equation to represent this situation. If each person pays an equal amount, and the total cost is $2,000, then the amount each person pays is $2,000 divided by the number of people. Let's denote the number of people as \\( n \\). So, each person's share is \\( \\frac{2000}{n} \\).\n\nNow, we don't want this share to exceed $150. So, we can set up an inequality:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2000}{n} \\leq 150 \\]\n\nTo find \\( n \\), I can solve this inequality. First, I'll multiply both sides by \\( n \\) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n\\[ 2000 \\leq 150n \\]\n\nThen, I'll divide both sides by 150 to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ n \\geq \\frac{2000}{150} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ n \\geq \\frac{2000}{150} = \\frac{2000 \\div 50}{150 \\div 50} = \\frac{40}{3} \\approx 13.333... \\]\n\nSince the number of people has to be a whole number, and we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to round up to the next whole number because 13 people would make each share a little over $150, which isn't allowed. So, \\( n \\) should be at least 14.\n\nLet me check that:\n\nIf \\( n = 14 \\), then each person pays \\( \\frac{2000}{14} \\approx 142.86 \\), which is less than $150.\n\nIf \\( n = 13 \\), then each person pays \\( \\frac{2000}{13} \\approx 153.85 \\), which exceeds $150.\n\nTherefore, at least 14 people are needed to keep each person's share at or below $150.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps there's a minimum number of people required, but maybe the rental has a minimum occupancy rule or something like that. The problem doesn't specify any such constraints, so I'll assume that the only constraint is the maximum share per person.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the rental cost includes other expenses like utilities, cleaning, etc. But again, the problem doesn't provide that information, so I'll assume that the $2,000 is the total cost to be split among the friends.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the friends are open to having some people pay less than $150 if there are more people. For example, if 15 people go, each pays about $133.33, which is fine. But the problem specifies that no one should pay more than $150, without mentioning anything about paying less being acceptable. So, as long as adding more people doesn't violate any other constraints, having more than 14 people would still satisfy the condition.\n\nHowever, typically, in such scenarios, the goal is to have as many people as necessary to keep individual shares low, but not more, perhaps to maintain the intimacy of the getaway. But again, since the problem doesn't specify any preferences beyond the financial constraint, the answer should purely be based on the mathematical calculation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, at least 14 people are needed to ensure that no one pays more than $150 for the beach house rental.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
