        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here: if a die is rolled three times, what's the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled will be exactly 12? Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. So, each time I roll the die, I can get any number from 1 to 6, and each outcome is equally likely.\n\nSince the die is rolled three times, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself three times, right? So, 6^3 = 216 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 216 outcomes sum up to exactly 12. That sounds like I need to count the number of triples (x, y, z), where each of x, y, and z is between 1 and 6, and x + y + z = 12.\n\nHmm, counting these directly might be a bit tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, there's a method called \"stars and bars\" for counting the number of ways to distribute items into categories. But in this case, there are restrictions because each die can only show numbers from 1 to 6.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I can consider the possible values for one of the dice and then find the number of ways the other two dice can sum up to the remaining total.\n\nLet's say I fix the first die showing a number k, where k is between 1 and 6. Then, the sum of the second and third dice needs to be 12 - k.\n\nSo, for each possible k, I need to find the number of ways two dice can sum up to 12 - k.\n\nI need to make sure that 12 - k is between 2 and 12, since two dice can sum from 2 to 12.\n\nWait, but since k is between 1 and 6, 12 - k ranges from 11 to 6. So, 6 to 11.\n\nBut two dice can only sum up to a maximum of 12, but in this case, it's from 6 to 11.\n\nLet me list out the possible k values and the corresponding sums for the other two dice:\n\n- If k = 1, then the other two need to sum to 11. Is that possible? Yes, because 5 + 6 = 11 and 6 + 5 = 11. So, two ways.\n\n- If k = 2, then sum is 10. Possible pairs: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4). So, three ways.\n\n- If k = 3, sum is 9. Pairs: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3). Four ways.\n\n- If k = 4, sum is 8. Pairs: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2). Five ways.\n\n- If k = 5, sum is 7. Pairs: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). Six ways.\n\n- If k = 6, sum is 6. Pairs: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1). Five ways.\n\nWait a minute, when k = 6, the sum needed from the other two dice is 6, which can be achieved with (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), and (5,1). That's five ways.\n\nSo, adding all these up: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 25.\n\nTherefore, there are 25 favorable outcomes where the sum is exactly 12.\n\nNow, the total number of possible outcomes is 216, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 25/216.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my addition: 2 + 3 is 5, plus 4 is 9, plus 5 is 14, plus 6 is 20, plus 5 is 25. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula I can use to confirm this.\n\nI recall that the number of solutions to the equation x + y + z = n, where each variable is between 1 and 6, can be found using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of solutions in positive integers to x + y + z = 12, without any upper bounds.\n\nUsing the stars and bars method, the number of solutions is C(12 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(11, 2) = 55.\n\nBut this counts solutions where some variables might be greater than 6, which are invalid in this context.\n\nSo, I need to subtract the number of solutions where at least one variable is greater than 6.\n\nLet's use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, count the number of solutions where x > 6. Let x' = x - 7, then x' >= 0, and the equation becomes x' + y + z = 5, which has C(5 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(7, 2) = 21 solutions.\n\nSimilarly, there are 21 solutions where y > 6, and 21 where z > 6.\n\nBut then I've subtracted too much, because solutions where two variables are greater than 6 have been subtracted twice, so I need to add those back.\n\nHowever, it's impossible for two variables to both be greater than 6, because if x > 6 and y > 6, then x + y >= 14, which exceeds 12. So, no need to add anything back.\n\nTherefore, the number of invalid solutions is 3 * 21 = 63.\n\nThus, the number of valid solutions is 55 - 63 = -8.\n\nWait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake here.\n\nLet me check my calculations.\n\nTotal unrestricted solutions: C(11, 2) = 55.\n\nNumber of solutions where x > 6: C(5 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(7, 2) = 21.\n\nSimilarly for y and z.\n\nBut 55 - 3*21 = 55 - 63 = -8, which is nonsense.\n\nWhat's going wrong here?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the unrestricted solutions count.\n\nWait, the formula for positive integers is C(n - 1, k - 1), where n is the target sum and k is the number of variables.\n\nHere, n = 12 and k = 3, so C(11, 2) = 55, that seems correct.\n\nBut when x > 6, let x' = x - 7, then x' >= 0, and x' + y + z = 5.\n\nThe number of solutions in positive integers is C(5 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nActually, in stars and bars, for x' + y + z = 5 with x', y, z >= 1, it's C(5 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nSo, the number of solutions where x > 6 is 6, similarly for y and z.\n\nTherefore, total invalid solutions are 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nNow, again check for solutions where two variables are greater than 6.\n\nAs before, if x > 6 and y > 6, then x' + y' + z = -1, which is impossible.\n\nSo, no need to add anything back.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid solutions is 55 - 18 = 37.\n\nBut earlier, I had 25 favorable outcomes, but now I'm getting 37.\n\nThat doesn't match. What's going on?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial counting.\n\nLet me list out all possible triples (x,y,z) where x + y + z = 12, and each is between 1 and 6.\n\nLet's start with x = 1:\n\nThen y + z = 11. Possible (y,z):\n\n(5,6), (6,5). That's two.\n\nx = 2:\n\ny + z = 10. Possible (4,6), (5,5), (6,4). That's three.\n\nx = 3:\n\ny + z = 9. Possible (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3). That's four.\n\nx = 4:\n\ny + z = 8. Possible (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2). That's five.\n\nx = 5:\n\ny + z = 7. Possible (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). That's six.\n\nx = 6:\n\ny + z = 6. Possible (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1). That's five.\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 25.\n\nBut according to the inclusion-exclusion method, I got 37.\n\nThat doesn't make sense. Maybe I messed up the inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nTotal unrestricted solutions in positive integers: C(11, 2) = 55.\n\nNow, subtract the cases where one variable is greater than 6.\n\nFor x > 6, let x' = x - 7, then x' >= 0, and x' + y + z = 5.\n\nThe number of solutions in positive integers is C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nSimilarly for y and z.\n\nSo, subtract 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nBut wait, is there any overlap where two variables are greater than 6? As before, x > 6 and y > 6 would require x' + y' + z = -1, which is impossible.\n\nSo, no need to add anything back.\n\nThus, the number of valid solutions is 55 - 18 = 37.\n\nBut earlier, by enumeration, I have only 25 solutions.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something in the inclusion-exclusion approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stars and bars method is not directly applicable here because the variables are bounded above.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nMaybe I can use generating functions.\n\nThe generating function for a single die is x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6.\n\nFor three dice, it's (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^3.\n\nI need the coefficient of x^12 in this expansion.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the generating function as x^3 * (1 - x^6)^3 / (1 - x)^3.\n\nBut maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look up the number of ways to sum three dice to get 12.\n\nI recall that the number of ways to sum three dice is symmetric around the mean, which is 10.5.\n\nBut since we're dealing with integers, perhaps I can use some symmetry here.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the possible sums and their frequencies.\n\nThe minimum sum is 3, and the maximum is 18.\n\nBut I need the sum to be 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of ways to get a sum s with three dice is the same as the number of ways to get a sum of 21 - s.\n\nBecause the distribution is symmetric around 10.5.\n\nWait, 21 - 12 = 9.\n\nSo, the number of ways to get 12 should be the same as the number of ways to get 9.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me count the number of ways directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a formula for the number of ways to roll a sum s with three dice.\n\nI think the formula is:\n\nNumber of ways = (s - 1)(s - 2)/2 - 3*(s - 6)(s - 7)/2 + 3*(s - 11)(s - 12)/2 - (s - 16)(s - 17)/2\n\nBut that seems too complicated, and I'm not sure if it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for three dice, the number of ways to sum to s is:\n\n- For s from 3 to 7: the number of ways is C(s - 1, 2) - C(s - 7 + 2, 2)\n\n- For s from 8 to 12: C(12 - s + 2, 2)\n\n- For s from 13 to 18: C(21 - s + 2, 2)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nMaybe I should look for a simpler way.\n\nLet me go back to the inclusion-exclusion approach.\n\nTotal unrestricted solutions: C(11, 2) = 55.\n\nSubtract the cases where one variable is greater than 6: 3 * C(4, 2) = 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nSo, 55 - 18 = 37.\n\nBut earlier, by enumeration, I have only 25 solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is not being applied correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust for the fact that the variables are bounded above by 6, not just below by 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the variables to be from 0 to 5, by letting x' = x - 1, y' = y - 1, z' = z - 1.\n\nThen, x' + y' + z' = 9, with each variable between 0 and 5.\n\nNow, the number of non-negative integer solutions to x' + y' + z' = 9 is C(9 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(11, 2) = 55.\n\nNow, subtract the cases where one variable is greater than 5.\n\nLet x' >= 6, let x'' = x' - 6, then x'' + y' + z' = 3.\n\nNumber of non-negative integer solutions: C(3 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nSimilarly for y' and z'.\n\nSo, subtract 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nBut now, check for cases where two variables are greater than 5.\n\nIf x' >= 6 and y' >= 6, then x'' + y'' + z' = -3, which is impossible.\n\nSo, no need to add anything back.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid solutions is 55 - 30 = 25.\n\nAh, that matches my earlier enumeration of 25 solutions.\n\nSo, the inclusion-exclusion approach gives 25 when properly applied.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 25.\n\nTotal possible outcomes are 6^3 = 216.\n\nHence, the probability is 25/216.\n\nTo double-check, perhaps I can see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the number of ways to sum three dice to 12 is 25, and the total outcomes are 216, so 25/216 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a table or a program to count the number of triples summing to 12.\n\nBut since I've cross-verified it with inclusion-exclusion and enumeration, I'm confident that 25 is the correct count.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 25/216.\n\nTo express it as a decimal, 25 divided by 216 is approximately 0.1157, or 11.57%.\n\nSo, there's roughly an 11.57% chance that the sum of three die rolls will be exactly 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{216}} \\]"
