        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere's a group of people, and their eye colors are divided like this: 40% have brown eyes, 30% have green eyes, and the rest have blue eyes. So first, I need to figure out what percentage has blue eyes.\n\nSince the total percentage must add up to 100%, I can calculate the blue-eyed people by subtracting the sum of brown and green-eyed percentages from 100%.\n\nSo, brown eyes: 40%, green eyes: 30%. That adds up to 70%. Therefore, blue eyes must be 100% - 70% = 30%.\n\nAlright, so 30% have blue eyes.\n\nNow, the problem says we randomly select two people from this group, and we need to find the probability that at least one person has blue eyes.\n\nHmm, \"at least one\" usually suggests that it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1.\n\nThe complementary event of \"at least one blue-eyed person\" is \"neither person has blue eyes,\" which means both have either brown or green eyes.\n\nWait, but the problem gives percentages for brown, green, and blue eyes. I think it's safer to work with probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person has blue eyes is 0.30, and the probability that a randomly selected person does not have blue eyes (i.e., has either brown or green eyes) is 0.70.\n\nNow, since we're selecting two people randomly, and assuming these selections are independent (which might not be strictly true if the group is finite, but for simplicity, I'll assume independence), the probability that both people do not have blue eyes is the product of their individual probabilities of not having blue eyes.\n\nSo, P(both not blue) = P(first not blue) * P(second not blue) = 0.70 * 0.70 = 0.49.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one has blue eyes is 1 - P(both not blue) = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider whether the selections are truly independent.\n\nIf the group is large, then removing one person won't affect the probabilities much, so independence is a reasonable assumption. But if the group is small, say only a few people, then selecting one person would change the probabilities for the second selection.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify the size of the group, I think it's acceptable to assume independence for simplicity.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this using combinations, considering the group size.\n\nLet's say there are n people in total. Then, the number of people with blue eyes is 0.3n, and the number without blue eyes is 0.7n.\n\nThe total number of ways to select 2 people from n is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nThe number of ways to select 2 people without any blue-eyed people is C(0.7n, 2) = (0.7n)(0.7n - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected people do not have blue eyes is [C(0.7n, 2)] / [C(n, 2)].\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n[(0.7n)(0.7n - 1)/2] / [n(n-1)/2] = [(0.7n)(0.7n - 1)] / [n(n-1)].\n\nWe can factor out n from numerator and denominator:\n\n(0.7)(0.7n - 1)/(n - 1).\n\nAs n becomes large, the term -1 becomes negligible compared to n, so this approximates to (0.7)(0.7) = 0.49, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the group size, assuming it's large, the probability is approximately 0.49 that both do not have blue eyes, and thus 1 - 0.49 = 0.51 that at least one has blue eyes.\n\nWait, but is there a more precise way to calculate this without assuming a large n?\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of sequential probabilities without replacement.\n\nThe probability that the first person selected does not have blue eyes is 0.70.\n\nGiven that the first person does not have blue eyes, the probability that the second person does not have blue eyes is (0.7n - 1)/(n - 1).\n\nSo, P(both not blue) = 0.70 * [(0.7n - 1)/(n - 1)].\n\nAgain, for large n, this approaches 0.70 * 0.70 = 0.49.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one has blue eyes is 1 - 0.49 = 0.51.\n\nI think this is consistent across different approaches, so I'm confident that 0.51 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability directly.\n\nThe event \"at least one blue-eyed person\" can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n\n1. Exactly one person has blue eyes.\n\n2. Both people have blue eyes.\n\nSo, P(at least one blue) = P(exactly one blue) + P(both blue).\n\nLet's calculate each of these.\n\nFirst, P(exactly one blue):\n\nThis can happen in two scenarios:\n\na. First person has blue eyes, second does not.\n\nb. First person does not have blue eyes, second does.\n\nSo, P(exactly one blue) = P(first blue and second not blue) + P(first not blue and second blue).\n\nAssuming independence:\n\nP(first blue and second not blue) = 0.30 * 0.70 = 0.21.\n\nP(first not blue and second blue) = 0.70 * 0.30 = 0.21.\n\nTherefore, P(exactly one blue) = 0.21 + 0.21 = 0.42.\n\nNext, P(both blue) = 0.30 * 0.30 = 0.09.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one blue) = 0.42 + 0.09 = 0.51.\n\nAgain, this matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo, whether I use the complementary probability approach or directly add the probabilities of the mutually exclusive events, I get the same result of 0.51.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one person has blue eyes is 51%.\n\nWait, but probabilities are usually expressed as decimals or fractions, not percentages. Maybe I should write it as 0.51 or 51%.\n\nHmm, the problem used percentages, so maybe 51% is fine.\n\nAlternatively, as a fraction, 51% is 51/100 or 0.51.\n\nI think 0.51 is precise and clear.\n\nSo, final answer: 0.51.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.51} \\]"
