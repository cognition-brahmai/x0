        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two boys, John and Jim, and they have marbles. The problem says that John has twice as many marbles as Jim, and together, they have 18 marbles. We need to find out how many marbles each one has.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have two unknowns here: the number of marbles John has and the number of marbles Jim has. But we're given some relationships between these unknowns that we can use to set up equations.\n\nLet's assign variables to these unknowns. I'll let:\n\n- Let \\( j \\) represent the number of marbles Jim has.\n\n- Since John has twice as many marbles as Jim, John has \\( 2j \\) marbles.\n\nNow, the problem also tells us that together they have 18 marbles. That means if we add the number of marbles John has to the number of marbles Jim has, we get 18.\n\nSo, we can write that as an equation:\n\n\\[ j + 2j = 18 \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify that equation. Combining like terms, \\( j + 2j \\) is \\( 3j \\), so:\n\n\\[ 3j = 18 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( j \\), I need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ j = \\frac{18}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ j = 6 \\]\n\nSo, Jim has 6 marbles.\n\nNow, since John has twice as many marbles as Jim, John has:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\] marbles.\n\nTo make sure our answer is correct, let's check if the numbers add up to 18:\n\nJim's marbles: 6\n\nJohn's marbles: 12\n\nTotal: \\( 6 + 12 = 18 \\)\n\nYes, that matches the total given in the problem.\n\nSo, Jim has 6 marbles and John has 12 marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Jim has 6 marbles and John has 12 marbles.}} \\]"
