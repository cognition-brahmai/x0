        "content": "So in this class, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 18 are boys, and the rest are girls. To find the ratio of boys to girls, I first need to figure out how many girls there are.\n\nSince there are 30 students overall and 18 of them are boys, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to find the number of girls.\n\nSo, number of girls = total students - number of boys\nNumber of girls = 30 - 18\nNumber of girls = 12\n\nNow, I have 18 boys and 12 girls. To find the ratio of boys to girls, I can write it as boys:girls, which is 18:12.\n\nBut ratios are usually expressed in their simplest form, so I should simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 18 and 12 is 6.\n\nSo, dividing both numbers by 6:\n\n18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n12 \u00f7 6 = 2\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio of boys to girls is 3:2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:2} \\]"
