        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we've got a shipping company that wants to upgrade its fleet. They currently have 50 ships, each carrying 10,000 tons and consuming 100 gallons of fuel per hour. They're looking to replace these with new ships that can carry 15,000 tons and consume only 80 gallons per hour. We need to calculate the increase in cargo capacity, the reduction in fuel consumption, and find out when this investment breaks even, considering each new ship costs $60 million and fuel is $3 per gallon.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the current situation.\n\nTotal current capacity:\n\n50 ships * 10,000 tons/ship = 500,000 tons\n\nTotal current fuel consumption per hour:\n\n50 ships * 100 gallons/hour/ship = 5,000 gallons/hour\n\nNow, if they replace all ships with the new ones:\n\nTotal new capacity:\n\n50 ships * 15,000 tons/ship = 750,000 tons\n\nTotal new fuel consumption per hour:\n\n50 ships * 80 gallons/hour/ship = 4,000 gallons/hour\n\nSo, the increase in cargo capacity is:\n\n750,000 tons - 500,000 tons = 250,000 tons\n\nAnd the reduction in fuel consumption is:\n\n5,000 gallons/hour - 4,000 gallons/hour = 1,000 gallons/hour\n\nNow, to find the break-even point, we need to calculate how much money they save on fuel with the new ships and see how long it takes for those savings to equal the cost of the new fleet.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost savings per hour:\n\nSavings per hour = (fuel savings per hour) * (cost per gallon)\n\nSavings per hour = 1,000 gallons/hour * $3/gallon = $3,000/hour\n\nNow, calculate the total cost of the new fleet:\n\nCost of new fleet = 50 ships * $60 million/ship = $3,000 million\n\nTo find the break-even point in hours:\n\nBreak-even hours = total cost / savings per hour\n\nBreak-even hours = $3,000,000,000 / $3,000/hour = 1,000,000 hours\n\nBut, to make this more meaningful, maybe we should convert this into years. Assuming the ships operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year:\n\nHours per year = 24 hours/day * 365 days/year = 8,760 hours/year\n\nBreak-even years = break-even hours / hours per year\n\nBreak-even years = 1,000,000 hours / 8,760 hours/year \u2248 114.15 years\n\nWait, that seems really high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal cost of new fleet: 50 ships * $60 million/ship = $3,000 million or $3 billion\n\nSavings per hour: 1,000 gallons/hour * $3/gallon = $3,000/hour\n\nBreak-even hours: $3,000,000,000 / $3,000/hour = 1,000,000 hours\n\nHours per year: 24 * 365 = 8,760 hours/year\n\nBreak-even years: 1,000,000 / 8,760 \u2248 114.15 years\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. Either the cost of the ships is too high, or the fuel savings are too low, or perhaps there's more to the cost savings than just fuel.\n\nMaybe I need to consider other operational costs or the revenue from carrying more cargo. The new ships can carry more cargo, which could generate more revenue.\n\nLet's think about that. The new fleet can carry 250,000 tons more than the old one. If they can fill that additional capacity, they'll earn more money.\n\nBut we don't have information on the revenue per ton of cargo. Maybe that's beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the break-even analysis should only consider the fuel savings, assuming everything else remains constant.\n\nBut even then, 114 years seems too long for a break-even point. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming the ships operate 24/7.\n\nIn reality, ships have voyages that may not be continuous. Maybe we should consider the operational hours more realistically.\n\nLet's assume that each ship operates 20 hours a day on average, accounting for loading, unloading, and maintenance.\n\nSo, hours per day: 20\n\nHours per year: 20 * 365 = 7,300 hours/year\n\nBreak-even years: 1,000,000 / 7,300 \u2248 137 years\n\nWait, that makes it even worse. This can't be right. There must be something wrong with the approach.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe the break-even point should be calculated based on the lifetime of the ships.\n\nSuppose the new ships have a certain lifespan, say 25 years, which is a common lifespan for cargo ships.\n\nOver 25 years, operating 24/7:\n\nTotal operational hours in 25 years: 25 * 8,760 = 219,000 hours\n\nTotal fuel savings over 25 years: 219,000 hours * $3,000/hour = $657,000,000\n\nBut the cost of the new fleet is $3,000,000,000, so even over 25 years, they only save $657 million, which is less than the cost.\n\nThis suggests that the break-even point is beyond 25 years, which is not practical.\n\nBut perhaps ships last longer. If they last 50 years:\n\nTotal operational hours: 50 * 8,760 = 438,000 hours\n\nTotal fuel savings: 438,000 * $3,000 = $1,314,000,000\n\nStill less than the $3,000,000,000 cost.\n\nEven over 100 years:\n\nTotal operational hours: 100 * 8,760 = 876,000 hours\n\nTotal fuel savings: 876,000 * $3,000 = $2,628,000,000\n\nStill short of the $3,000,000,000 cost.\n\nWait, this isn't adding up. There must be a mistake in my assumptions.\n\nLet's reconsider the fuel savings. Maybe the new ships are not only more fuel-efficient in consumption but also in terms of speed or other operational efficiencies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost of $60 million per ship is inclusive of other costs beyond just the purchase price, like maintenance and crew costs, which might affect the break-even analysis.\n\nBut without specific information, it's hard to factor those in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of the additional cargo capacity should be considered in the break-even analysis.\n\nIf the new ships can carry 250,000 more tons, and if there's demand for that capacity, the additional revenue could help offset the cost of the new fleet.\n\nBut again, without knowing the revenue per ton, it's difficult to quantify that.\n\nMaybe the problem expects us to consider only the fuel savings.\n\nIn that case, the break-even point is indeed around 114 years, which seems unrealistic.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the fuel consumption figures or the cost of fuel.\n\nLet me check the fuel consumption again.\n\nOld ships: 100 gallons/hour each\n\nNew ships: 80 gallons/hour each\n\nSo, per ship, savings of 20 gallons/hour.\n\nTotal fleet: 50 ships\n\nTotal savings: 50 * 20 = 1,000 gallons/hour\n\nFuel cost: $3/gallon\n\nSo, $3,000/hour savings\n\nTotal cost: $3,000,000,000\n\nBreak-even hours: 1,000,000 hours\n\nConvert to years:\n\nAssuming 24/7 operation: 8,760 hours/year\n\n1,000,000 / 8,760 \u2248 114 years\n\nAlternatively, if ships operate only, say, 12 hours a day:\n\nHours per year: 12 * 365 = 4,380\n\nBreak-even years: 1,000,000 / 4,380 \u2248 228 years\n\nThis is not feasible. There must be an error in the given data or in my assumptions.\n\nPerhaps the fuel savings are not the only benefit. Maybe the new ships are faster, allowing more trips in the same period, which could increase revenue.\n\nOr maybe they have lower crew costs or maintenance costs.\n\nBut again, without specific numbers, it's hard to include those in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost of $60 million per ship includes all these factors, and the break-even is based solely on fuel savings.\n\nIn that case, the break-even period is indeed very long, which might suggest that the investment isn't worthwhile based on fuel savings alone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company considers other benefits, such as reduced emissions, improved cargo handling, or increased market share, which aren't quantified here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the fuel consumption figures.\n\nLet me check the fuel consumption again.\n\nOld ships: 100 gallons/hour each\n\nNew ships: 80 gallons/hour each\n\nSo, a 20% reduction in fuel consumption per ship.\n\nBut with the capacity increasing by 50% (from 10,000 to 15,000 tons), the fuel efficiency in terms of tons per gallon improves.\n\nOld ships: 10,000 tons / 100 gallons/hour = 100 tons per gallon per hour\n\nNew ships: 15,000 tons / 80 gallons/hour = 187.5 tons per gallon per hour\n\nSo, the fuel efficiency has improved from 100 tons per gallon per hour to 187.5 tons per gallon per hour, which is a significant improvement.\n\nBut in terms of absolute fuel consumption, with 50 ships:\n\nOld: 5,000 gallons/hour\n\nNew: 4,000 gallons/hour\n\nSavings: 1,000 gallons/hour\n\nAt $3 per gallon, that's $3,000/hour savings.\n\nGiven the high cost of the new fleet, the break-even point is indeed very long.\n\nPerhaps the company considers other costs or benefits that aren't mentioned here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company is focusing on the environmental benefits or long-term fuel price increases.\n\nBut based on the given data, the break-even point is around 114 years, which seems impractical.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that, based solely on fuel savings, replacing the entire fleet isn't financially viable, as the break-even point is too far out.\n\nHowever, there might be other strategic reasons for the company to make this investment, such as complying with emission regulations, improving cargo capacity to meet demand, or enhancing the fleet's overall efficiency in other ways.\n\nBut strictly from a financial perspective, with the given data, the investment doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal cost: 50 ships * $60 million/ship = $3,000,000,000\n\nFuel savings per hour: 1,000 gallons/hour * $3/gallon = $3,000/hour\n\nBreak-even hours: $3,000,000,000 / $3,000/hour = 1,000,000 hours\n\nAssuming 24/7 operation: 8,760 hours/year\n\nBreak-even years: 1,000,000 / 8,760 \u2248 114 years\n\nYes, the math checks out. So, the break-even point is approximately 114 years.\n\nTherefore, the company would need to operate the new fleet for over a century to recoup the investment cost solely from fuel savings, which is not a practical scenario.\n\nHence, the company should consider other factors beyond just fuel savings when deciding whether to replace its fleet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{114 \\text{ years}} \\]"
