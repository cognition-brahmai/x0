        "content": "Let's see. The company spends $5,000 on advertising every month, and they make an average profit of $25 per product sold. I need to find out how many products they need to sell to cover that advertising cost.\n\nSo, basically, they need their total profit from the products sold to equal the advertising cost. If each product gives them $25 in profit, then the number of products they need to sell is the advertising cost divided by the profit per product.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of products = Advertising cost / Profit per product\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of products = $5,000 / $25\n\nNow, $5,000 divided by $25 is 200. So, they need to sell 200 products to cover their advertising costs.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Is there a possibility that the profit per product includes other costs besides advertising? Or are there any variable costs per product that I should account for?\n\nThe question says that the average profit per product is $25, which probably means that this is the profit after all other costs have been accounted for, except for the advertising cost, which is a separate fixed cost.\n\nSo, in that case, yes, selling 200 products at $25 profit each would give them $5,000 in profit, which would cover the advertising cost.\n\nAlternatively, if they sell more than 200 products, their profit would increase beyond the advertising cost, and if they sell less, they wouldn't cover the advertising cost.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for how many products they need to sell to cover the advertising costs, so 200 seems to be the answer.\n\nStill, it's always good to double-check the calculations.\n\n$25 per product times 200 products equals $5,000.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the company needs to sell 200 products each month to cover its advertising costs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
