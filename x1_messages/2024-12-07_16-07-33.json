        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a tree that doubles its height every year, and after 5 years, it's 32 feet tall. We need to find out how tall it was after the first year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the tree to double its height every year. That means each year, the tree's height is twice what it was the previous year. So, if I know the height in one year, I can find the height in the previous year by dividing by 2.\n\nGiven that after 5 years, the tree is 32 feet tall, I can work backwards to find the height in each preceding year.\n\nLet's denote the height of the tree after year n as h_n.\n\nSo, h_5 = 32 feet.\n\nSince the tree doubles its height every year, h_5 = 2 * h_4.\n\nTherefore, h_4 = h_5 / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16 feet.\n\nSimilarly, h_4 = 2 * h_3, so h_3 = h_4 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 feet.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nh_3 = 2 * h_2 \u2192 h_2 = h_3 / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 feet.\n\nh_2 = 2 * h_1 \u2192 h_1 = h_2 / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 feet.\n\nSo, the tree was 2 feet tall after the first year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf the tree is 2 feet after the first year, then:\n\nAfter the second year: 2 * 2 = 4 feet.\n\nAfter the third year: 4 * 2 = 8 feet.\n\nAfter the fourth year: 8 * 2 = 16 feet.\n\nAfter the fifth year: 16 * 2 = 32 feet.\n\nYes, that matches the given information.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the tree's height growth in terms of exponential growth. Since it doubles every year, its height can be expressed as h * 2^n, where h is the initial height, and n is the number of years.\n\nGiven that after 5 years, the height is 32 feet, I can set up the equation:\n\nh * 2^5 = 32.\n\nSince 2^5 = 32, then h * 32 = 32, which implies h = 1 foot.\n\nWait, that suggests the initial height was 1 foot. But earlier, I calculated that after the first year, it was 2 feet. That seems consistent because if it started at 1 foot, after the first year, it would double to 2 feet.\n\nSo, the initial height is 1 foot, after the first year it's 2 feet, and so on, up to 32 feet after 5 years.\n\nTherefore, the height after the first year is indeed 2 feet.\n\nBut the problem asks for the height after the first year, so 2 feet is the answer.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using logarithms or other mathematical tools, but that seems unnecessary for this straightforward doubling pattern.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the height after n years as h_n = h_0 * 2^n, where h_0 is the initial height.\n\nGiven h_5 = 32 = h_0 * 2^5 = h_0 * 32.\n\nSo, h_0 = 32 / 32 = 1 foot.\n\nThen, h_1 = h_0 * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2 feet.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nI think this confirms that the height after the first year is 2 feet.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the growth sequence:\n\nStart: 1 foot.\n\nYear 1: 1 * 2 = 2 feet.\n\nYear 2: 2 * 2 = 4 feet.\n\nYear 3: 4 * 2 = 8 feet.\n\nYear 4: 8 * 2 = 16 feet.\n\nYear 5: 16 * 2 = 32 feet.\n\nAgain, matching the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, no matter which approach I take, the height after the first year is consistently 2 feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
