        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of books using Node.js and the Express framework. Since you want to store data in-memory without a database, we'll use an array to hold the book data.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js installed, open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir book-api\ncd book-api\n```\n\nNext, initialize a new Node.js project by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis command creates a `package.json` file with default settings.\n\nNow, install Express and any other necessary packages:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express body-parser\n```\n\nWe'll use `express` for the server and `body-parser` to handle JSON data in requests.\n\nCreate a new file called `app.js` in your project directory and open it in your favorite text editor.\n\nLet's start by setting up the basic structure of our Express app:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis code sets up an Express app, enables JSON parsing for request bodies, and starts the server on port 3000.\n\nNow, let's define the in-memory storage for our books. We'll use an array to hold book objects, each with properties for title, author, publication year, and ISBN.\n\nAdd the following code above the `app.listen` call:\n\n```javascript\nlet books = [];\nlet currentId = 1;\n```\n\nWe'll use `currentId` to assign unique IDs to each book.\n\nNext, let's implement the CRUD operations.\n\n**1. Create a new book (POST /books)**\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title, author, publicationYear, isbn } = req.body;\n  if (!title || !author || !publicationYear || !isbn) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });\n  }\n  const newBook = {\n    id: currentId++,\n    title,\n    author,\n    publicationYear,\n    isbn\n  };\n  books.push(newBook);\n  res.status(201).json(newBook);\n});\n```\n\n**2. Get all books (GET /books)**\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(books);\n});\n```\n\n**3. Get a single book by ID (GET /books/:id)**\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const book = books.find(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (!book) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  res.json(book);\n});\n```\n\n**4. Update a book by ID (PUT /books/:id)**\n\n```javascript\napp.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (index === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  const updatedBook = { ...books[index], ...req.body, id: bookId };\n  books[index] = updatedBook;\n  res.json(updatedBook);\n});\n```\n\n**5. Delete a book by ID (DELETE /books/:id)**\n\n```javascript\napp.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (index === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  const deletedBook = books.splice(index, 1);\n  res.json(deletedBook[0]);\n});\n```\n\nThat's it! You've implemented a simple RESTful API for managing books with CRUD operations using Express and in-memory storage.\n\nTo test your API, you can use tools like Postman or curl to make HTTP requests to the endpoints you've created.\n\nFor example, to create a new book, you can send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/books` with a JSON body like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Sample Book\",\n  \"author\": \"Author Name\",\n  \"publicationYear\": 2023,\n  \"isbn\": \"1234567890\"\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can send GET requests to `http://localhost:3000/books` to retrieve all books or to `http://localhost:3000/books/:id` to get a specific book by its ID.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with your book API!
