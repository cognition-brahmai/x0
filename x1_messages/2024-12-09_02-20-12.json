        "content": "To determine the compound interest earned on a $1000 investment at a 5% annual rate after 3 years, we can use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{n \\times t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- \\( P = 1000 \\) dollars\n- \\( r = 5\\% = 0.05 \\)\n- \\( t = 3 \\) years\n\nAssuming the interest is compounded annually (\\( n = 1 \\)), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{1}\\right)^{1 \\times 3} \\]\n\\[ A = 1000 \\left(1 + 0.05\\right)^3 \\]\n\\[ A = 1000 \\left(1.05\\right)^3 \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( (1.05)^3 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.05 \\times 1.05 = 1.1025 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 1.05 again:\n\n\\[ 1.1025 \\times 1.05 = 1.157625 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A = 1000 \\times 1.157625 = 1157.625 \\]\n\nThe amount after 3 years is $1157.63 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nTo find the compound interest earned, subtract the principal from this amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = A - P = 1157.63 - 1000 = 157.63 \\]\n\nTherefore, the compound interest earned is $157.63.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nCompound interest differs from simple interest in that it accounts for interest earned on the accumulated interest from previous periods. In this case, since the interest is compounded annually, each year's interest is calculated on the initial principal plus any interest accumulated up to that point.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the calculation for each year:\n\n**Year 1:**\n\nInterest = \\( 1000 \\times 0.05 = 50 \\) dollars\n\nTotal amount = \\( 1000 + 50 = 1050 \\) dollars\n\n**Year 2:**\n\nInterest = \\( 1050 \\times 0.05 = 52.50 \\) dollars\n\nTotal amount = \\( 1050 + 52.50 = 1102.50 \\) dollars\n\n**Year 3:**\n\nInterest = \\( 1102.50 \\times 0.05 = 55.125 \\) dollars\n\nTotal amount = \\( 1102.50 + 55.125 = 1157.625 \\) dollars\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this is $1157.63, and the compound interest earned is $157.63.\n\nIf the interest were compounded more frequently (e.g., quarterly, monthly), the formula would adjust accordingly by changing the value of \\( n \\), which is the number of times interest is compounded per year. For instance, if compounded quarterly, \\( n = 4 \\), and the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times t} \\]\n\nBut in this specific problem, since it's compounded annually, \\( n = 1 \\), and the calculation proceeds as shown above."
