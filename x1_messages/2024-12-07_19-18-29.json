        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability that if I draw two balls at random without replacement, both of them are red.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 10. And the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of the 4 red balls available.\n\nI think I should use combinations here because the order in which I draw the balls doesn't matter. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, and permutations are used when the order does matter.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is \"10 choose 2\", which is calculated as:\n\n10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 4 is \"4 choose 2\", which is:\n\n4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2!) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 6\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 6 / 45, which simplifies to 2 / 15.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities step by step, considering the draws one at a time.\n\nOkay, let's try that. The probability that the first ball drawn is red is 4 out of 10, since there are 4 red balls and 10 balls in total. So, that's 4/10 or 2/5.\n\nNow, since we're drawing without replacement, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first draw. So, if the first ball was red, there are now 3 red balls left and a total of 9 balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is 3/9 or 1/3.\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen\u2014that both balls are red\u2014I need to multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event given the first. That is:\n\n(4/10) \u00d7 (3/9) = (2/5) \u00d7 (1/3) = 2/15\n\nSo, I get the same answer as before, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf I consider the order in which the balls are drawn, then the total number of possible outcomes is the number of permutations of 10 balls taken 2 at a time, which is 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes would be the number of permutations of 4 red balls taken 2 at a time, which is 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the probability would be 12 / 90, which simplifies to 2/15 again.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with the same answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible approaches here. It's always good to verify the answer using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that I might have missed. For example, is there a possibility that the balls are not equally likely to be drawn? But the problem doesn't suggest anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that each ball has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\nAlso, since the drawing is without replacement, I had to adjust the probabilities accordingly for the second draw.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the problem is considering the balls to be distinct or indistinct. In probability problems involving balls, they are usually considered distinct unless specified otherwise. However, in this case, since we're dealing with colors, maybe the individual identities don't matter beyond their color.\n\nBut in the calculations I did, I treated the balls as distinct, which is appropriate for probability calculations.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 2/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{15}} \\]"
