        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with marbles of different colors: 5 red, 4 green, and 6 blue. And the question is, if you pick one marble at random, what's the probability that it's either red or green?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula for probability. Probability of an event is usually the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a green marble, and the total outcomes are all the marbles in the bag.\n\nLet me count the total number of marbles. There are 5 red, 4 green, and 6 blue. So, total marbles = 5 + 4 + 6 = 15 marbles.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red marbles plus the number of green marbles, which is 5 + 4 = 9.\n\nSo, the probability should be 9/15.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. Both 9 and 15 are divisible by 3. So, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 15 divided by 3 is 5. Therefore, the simplified probability is 3/5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Sometimes it helps to think about complementary probabilities or other approaches to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not picking a blue marble, since the only other options are red and green. So, the probability of not picking blue would be 1 minus the probability of picking blue.\n\nThe number of blue marbles is 6, and the total is 15, so the probability of picking blue is 6/15, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking blue is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, that's a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages to understand it better. 3/5 is equivalent to 60%, so there's a 60% chance of picking either red or green.\n\nBut I think the question is expecting the answer in fraction form, so I'll stick with 3/5.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this to ensure I'm not missing something? Maybe using combinations or something, but that seems like overkill for a simple probability problem.\n\nWait, another way: the probability of picking red is 5/15, which simplifies to 1/3. The probability of picking green is 4/15. So, the probability of picking red or green is 1/3 + 4/15.\n\nTo add those fractions, I need a common denominator, which would be 15. So, 1/3 is equivalent to 5/15, and 4/15 stays the same. So, 5/15 + 4/15 = 9/15, which again simplifies to 3/5.\n\nAlright, consistent again. I think I'm solid on this.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the marbles are being picked without replacement or anything like that, but the problem says \"pick one marble,\" so it's a single draw.\n\nAlso, assuming that each marble is equally likely to be picked, which is standard unless otherwise stated.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of picking either a red or a green marble is 3/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
