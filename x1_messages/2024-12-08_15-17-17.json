        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a library's reading challenge. Kids earn points for reading books: 2 points for each picture book and 5 points for each chapter book. Together, they read 400 books and earned 1300 points. I need to figure out how many of each type of book they read.\n\nAlright, first thing I notice is that there are two types of books: picture books and chapter books. Each type gives a different number of points. So, I think I need to set up some equations to represent this situation.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let\u2019s say \\( p \\) is the number of picture books.\n\n- And \\( c \\) is the number of chapter books.\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\n1. The total number of books is 400. So, \\( p + c = 400 \\).\n\n2. The total points earned are 1300. Since picture books are worth 2 points each and chapter books are worth 5 points each, the total points would be \\( 2p + 5c = 1300 \\).\n\nSo, I have a system of two equations:\n\n(1) \\( p + c = 400 \\)\n\n(2) \\( 2p + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( p \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nHmm, there are a few ways to solve systems of equations like this. I could use substitution or elimination. Let\u2019s think about which one might be easier.\n\nSubstitution might work. From equation (1), I can solve for \\( p \\) in terms of \\( c \\):\n\n\\( p = 400 - c \\)\n\nThen, I can substitute this expression for \\( p \\) into equation (2):\n\n\\( 2(400 - c) + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\nLet me try that:\n\n\\( 2*400 - 2c + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 800 + 3c = 1300 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 800 from both sides:\n\n\\( 3c = 500 \\)\n\nThen, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\( c = \\frac{500}{3} \\)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the number of books should be a whole number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me check that again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\( 2(400 - c) + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 800 - 2c + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 800 + 3c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 3c = 500 \\)\n\n\\( c = \\frac{500}{3} \\)\n\nHmm, \\( \\frac{500}{3} \\) is approximately 166.666, which isn't a whole number. But the number of books has to be a whole number. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe elimination would work better.\n\nSo, starting again with the two equations:\n\n(1) \\( p + c = 400 \\)\n\n(2) \\( 2p + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\nLet me try to eliminate one of the variables. Maybe I can eliminate \\( p \\). To do that, I could multiply equation (1) by 2:\n\n\\( 2p + 2c = 800 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this from equation (2):\n\n\\( (2p + 5c) - (2p + 2c) = 1300 - 800 \\)\n\n\\( 2p + 5c - 2p - 2c = 500 \\)\n\n\\( 3c = 500 \\)\n\nAgain, I get \\( c = \\frac{500}{3} \\), which is not a whole number. That can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nLet me double-check the problem statement.\n\n\"Children read a total of 400 books and earned 1300 points. Picture books earn 2 points each, and chapter books earn 5 points each.\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that the points might include points from other sources or there's a mistake in the total points or books. But assuming the problem is correctly stated, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nMaybe I can consider that the average points per book is \\( \\frac{1300}{400} = 3.25 \\) points per book.\n\nNow, since picture books are 2 points and chapter books are 5 points, the average being 3.25 suggests that most books are picture books with some chapter books.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of weighted averages.\n\nLet\u2019s say the fraction of picture books is \\( f \\), then the fraction of chapter books is \\( 1 - f \\).\n\nThe average points would be \\( 2f + 5(1 - f) = 3.25 \\)\n\nLet me solve for \\( f \\):\n\n\\( 2f + 5 - 5f = 3.25 \\)\n\n\\( -3f + 5 = 3.25 \\)\n\n\\( -3f = -1.75 \\)\n\n\\( f = \\frac{1.75}{3} = 0.5833... \\)\n\nSo, approximately 58.33% are picture books.\n\nThen, the number of picture books is \\( 0.5833 \\times 400 \\approx 233.333 \\), which again isn't a whole number.\n\nWait, this is consistent with my earlier result of \\( c = \\frac{500}{3} \\approx 166.666 \\), since \\( p = 400 - c = 400 - 166.666 = 233.333 \\).\n\nBut the number of books can't be a fraction. Maybe the problem has a typo or the totals are impossible with whole books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait, maybe there are other types of books or points are earned differently. But according to the problem, only picture and chapter books are mentioned.\n\nAnother approach: maybe use multiples.\n\nLet me assume that the number of chapter books is a multiple of 3, since \\( c = \\frac{500}{3} \\).\n\nBut 500 is not divisible by 3, so that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me try solving the system again.\n\nStarting with:\n\n(1) \\( p + c = 400 \\)\n\n(2) \\( 2p + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\nLet me solve equation (1) for \\( p \\):\n\n\\( p = 400 - c \\)\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\n\\( 2(400 - c) + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 800 - 2c + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 800 + 3c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 3c = 500 \\)\n\n\\( c = \\frac{500}{3} \\)\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can multiply equation (1) by 5 and equation (2) by 1:\n\n(1) \\( 5p + 5c = 2000 \\)\n\n(2) \\( 2p + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n\\( (5p + 5c) - (2p + 5c) = 2000 - 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 3p = 700 \\)\n\n\\( p = \\frac{700}{3} \\approx 233.333 \\)\n\nThen, \\( c = 400 - p = 400 - 233.333 = 166.666 \\)\n\nStill not whole numbers.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the problem's data or that the scenario is impossible with whole books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the points are earned differently, but according to the problem, it's straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe the points include additional bonuses, and the 1300 points aren't solely from the books. But the problem says \"for each picture book, they earn 2 points. For each chapter book, they earn 5 points. At the end of the month, the library reports that the children read a total of 400 books and earned 1300 points.\"\n\nSo, it seems like the points are solely from the books read.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the points are accumulated over multiple readings, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nGiven that, I think the only conclusion is that the problem has a mistake, as the solution doesn't yield whole numbers for the counts of books.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe some books are counted in both categories or there are books that don't earn points. But the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the points are per reading session, not per book. But again, the problem seems clear that it's per book.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are different point systems for different groups of children, but the problem doesn't indicate that.\n\nGiven that, I think the most likely scenario is that there's an error in the problem's numbers.\n\nNonetheless, based on the given data, the solution would be approximately 233 picture books and 167 chapter books, but that doesn't add up exactly due to the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of fractions, but that doesn't make practical sense for counting books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe \"the children read a total of 400 books\" means the total number of books read by all children, and \"earned 1300 points\" is the total points earned by all children.\n\nPerhaps it's not per child but overall.\n\nBut in that case, the equations should still hold, as it's the total books and total points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some children didn't earn any points, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are books that don't earn points, but again, the problem seems to indicate only picture and chapter books.\n\nWait, maybe there are books that earn 0 points. But the problem only mentions picture and chapter books, so perhaps all books earn points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the points are earned per page, not per book, but that's not what the problem states.\n\nGiven that, I think the initial approach is correct, but the solution isn't yielding whole numbers, suggesting a possible error in the problem's data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point values are different. Maybe picture books are worth 3 points each and chapter books 4 points each, but the problem clearly states 2 and 5 points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the totals are incorrect. Maybe the total points are supposed to be 1200 instead of 1300.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nIf total points are 1200, then:\n\n\\( 2p + 5c = 1200 \\)\n\nWith \\( p + c = 400 \\), so \\( p = 400 - c \\)\n\nSubstitute:\n\n\\( 2(400 - c) + 5c = 1200 \\)\n\n\\( 800 - 2c + 5c = 1200 \\)\n\n\\( 800 + 3c = 1200 \\)\n\n\\( 3c = 400 \\)\n\n\\( c = \\frac{400}{3} \\), still not a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total books are 400, and total points are 1400.\n\nThen:\n\n\\( 2p + 5c = 1400 \\)\n\n\\( p + c = 400 \\)\n\n\\( p = 400 - c \\)\n\nSubstitute:\n\n\\( 2(400 - c) + 5c = 1400 \\)\n\n\\( 800 - 2c + 5c = 1400 \\)\n\n\\( 800 + 3c = 1400 \\)\n\n\\( 3c = 600 \\)\n\n\\( c = 200 \\)\n\nThen, \\( p = 400 - 200 = 200 \\)\n\nThat would be a whole number. Let me check the total points:\n\n\\( 2*200 + 5*200 = 400 + 1000 = 1400 \\), which matches this\u5047\u8bbe.\n\nBut the original problem states 1300 points, not 1400.\n\nAlternatively, maybe total books are 300 and points are 1300.\n\nThen:\n\n\\( p + c = 300 \\)\n\n\\( 2p + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\nSolve for \\( p \\):\n\n\\( p = 300 - c \\)\n\nSubstitute:\n\n\\( 2(300 - c) + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 600 - 2c + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 600 + 3c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 3c = 700 \\)\n\n\\( c = \\frac{700}{3} \\), still not a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe total books are 400 and points are 1200.\n\nThen:\n\n\\( p + c = 400 \\)\n\n\\( 2p + 5c = 1200 \\)\n\n\\( p = 400 - c \\)\n\nSubstitute:\n\n\\( 2(400 - c) + 5c = 1200 \\)\n\n\\( 800 - 2c + 5c = 1200 \\)\n\n\\( 800 + 3c = 1200 \\)\n\n\\( 3c = 400 \\)\n\n\\( c = \\frac{400}{3} \\), not a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe total books are 350 and points are 1300.\n\nThen:\n\n\\( p + c = 350 \\)\n\n\\( 2p + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( p = 350 - c \\)\n\nSubstitute:\n\n\\( 2(350 - c) + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 700 - 2c + 5c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 700 + 3c = 1300 \\)\n\n\\( 3c = 600 \\)\n\n\\( c = 200 \\)\n\nThen, \\( p = 350 - 200 = 150 \\)\n\nCheck total points:\n\n\\( 2*150 + 5*200 = 300 + 1000 = 1300 \\), which matches.\n\nBut the original problem says total books are 400, not 350.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misrecording in the totals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem intended for 350 books and 1300 points, leading to 150 picture books and 200 chapter books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point values are different, but the problem clearly states 2 points for picture books and 5 for chapter books.\n\nGiven that, and assuming the problem's data is correct, the solution would involve fractional books, which doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nTherefore, I suspect there might be an error in the problem's data.\n\nHowever, based on the given data, the solution would be approximately 233 picture books and 167 chapter books, but since that doesn't yield exact totals, it's likely a mistake in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the library includes other types of books that earn different points, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nGiven all that, I think the most accurate answer is that the problem contains inconsistent data, as it leads to a non-integer number of books, which isn't possible in reality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The problem contains inconsistent data, leading to a non-integer number of books.} } \\]"
