Wait, but books don't really have words in the sense that they can choose them; the words are written by authors. Maybe it's a sign, like a street sign or a signpost. Those have words, and they don't speak either. Or perhaps it's a person, but people can speak, so that doesn't fit. Maybe it's a billboard or a poster. Yeah, those have words and don't speak. So, perhaps the answer is a sign or a poster. What do you think?"
