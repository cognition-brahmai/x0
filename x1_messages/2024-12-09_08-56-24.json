        "content": "So, the Apollo 17 astronauts brought back some orange soil from the Moon, and now people want to know which government agency was in charge of analyzing it. Well, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, Apollo 17 was a mission by NASA, right? NASA is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and they're in charge of space exploration and aeronautics in the United States. So, it makes sense that NASA would be handling the samples brought back from the Moon.\n\nBut maybe other agencies were involved too. For example, some scientific research might have been done by the USGS, which is the United States Geological Survey. They're experts in earth sciences, so they might have helped analyze lunar rocks.\n\nAlso, considering the Cold War context and the space race with the Soviet Union, perhaps there was some involvement from the Department of Defense or other intelligence agencies, but that seems less likely for public scientific analysis.\n\nWait, I remember reading somewhere that the lunar samples were curated and distributed by NASA, but various scientific institutions and government agencies might have been involved in the analysis.\n\nLet me see if I can recall specifically about the orange soil. I think it was discovered by astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan during their lunar extravehicular activities on Apollo 17.\n\nSchmitt, in particular, was a geologist, which is unique because he was the only professional scientist to walk on the Moon. So, his expertise probably played a big role in identifying and collecting those samples.\n\nOnce the samples were brought back to Earth, they were likely first processed and curated at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. That's where the lunar receiving laboratory is located, designed specifically to handle and preserve lunar samples.\n\nFrom there, samples would have been distributed to various research institutions and government agencies for analysis. So, while NASA was the primary curator and distributor, the actual analysis could have been conducted by a variety of entities, including universities, private research labs, and government agencies like USGS.\n\nBut if I had to pick one government agency that was primarily responsible for analyzing the lunar samples, I would say it was NASA, given that they were the ones who organized and funded the Apollo program and the subsequent sample analysis.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that scientific research is often collaborative, involving multiple institutions and agencies. So, while NASA might have been the lead, they certainly wouldn't have been the only ones involved.\n\nAnother angle to consider is that some of the analysis might have been done internationally, as NASA has collaborated with scientists from other countries on lunar research. But again, the primary oversight would still be from NASA.\n\nSo, to directly answer the question: the government agency that analyzed the orange soil brought back by Apollo 17 astronauts was NASA, although other agencies and institutions may have been involved in the research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{NASA}} \\]"
