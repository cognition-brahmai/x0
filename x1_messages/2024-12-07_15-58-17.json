        "content": "So I have this book with 200 pages, and I plan to read 20 pages each day. I need to figure out how many days it will take me to finish the whole book. Hmm, this seems like a straightforward division problem.\n\nFirst, I'll take the total number of pages in the book, which is 200, and divide that by the number of pages I plan to read per day, which is 20. So, 200 divided by 20 should give me the number of days required.\n\nLet me do the math: 200 \u00f7 20 equals 10. So, it should take me 10 days to finish the book.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this. For example, what if I sometimes read more than 20 pages in a day, or less? But according to the question, I'm reading a consistent 20 pages per day, so I don't need to worry about variations.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the book has any illustrations or appendices that might affect the page count, but again, the question states that the book has 200 pages, and I'm reading 20 pages per day, so I think 10 days is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I can think about it differently. If I read 20 pages each day, after one day I'll have read 20 pages, after two days 40 pages, and so on. So, multiplying 20 pages per day by 10 days gives me 200 pages, which matches the total number of pages in the book.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of fractions. Each day, I'm reading 20 out of 200 pages, which is 20/200, which simplifies to 1/10. So, each day I'm completing 1/10 of the book. Therefore, it would take 10 days to complete the entire book.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer remains the same: 10 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
