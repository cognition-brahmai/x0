        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence defined by a recursive formula: a_n = 2a_(n-1) - a_(n-2), and the first two terms are a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 3. I need to find the sixth term, a_6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a recursive formula is. A recursive formula defines each term in a sequence based on the preceding terms. In this case, each term a_n is defined as twice the previous term a_(n-1) minus the term before that, a_(n-2).\n\nSo, to find a_6, I'll need to find the terms one by one, starting from a_1 and a_2.\n\nGiven:\n\na_1 = 1\n\na_2 = 3\n\nNow, let's find a_3 using the formula:\n\na_3 = 2a_2 - a_1 = 2*3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\n\nNext, a_4:\n\na_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 = 2*5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\nThen, a_5:\n\na_5 = 2a_4 - a_3 = 2*7 - 5 = 14 - 5 = 9\n\nFinally, a_6:\n\na_6 = 2a_5 - a_4 = 2*9 - 7 = 18 - 7 = 11\n\nSo, the sixth term, a_6, is 11.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've applied the formula correctly at each step.\n\nStarting with a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 3.\n\na_3 = 2*3 - 1 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = 2*5 - 3 = 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = 2*7 - 5 = 9 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 2*9 - 7 = 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems correct. Alternatively, I can look for a pattern or try to find a general formula for the sequence.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\na_1 = 1\n\na_2 = 3\n\na_3 = 5\n\na_4 = 7\n\na_5 = 9\n\na_6 = 11\n\nIt appears that each term increases by 2 from the previous one. So, it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference.\n\nHere, a_1 = 1 and d = 2.\n\nSo, a_n = 1 + (n-1)*2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1.\n\nLet me verify this general formula with the given terms.\n\nFor n=1: 2*1 - 1 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: 2*2 - 1 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: 2*3 - 1 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: 2*4 - 1 = 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: 2*5 - 1 = 9 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: 2*6 - 1 = 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the general formula matches the recursive definition.\n\nSo, a_6 = 2*6 - 1 = 11.\n\nTherefore, the sixth term is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
