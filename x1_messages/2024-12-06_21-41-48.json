        "content": "To find out what percentage of spider species are found in North America, we can use a simple formula for calculating percentages. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of spider species found in North America, which is about 3,000. The \"whole\" is the total number of spider species in the world, which is approximately 50,000.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{3,000}{50,000} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide 3,000 by 50,000:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,000}{50,000} = 0.06\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.06 \\times 100 = 6\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, about 6% of spider species are found in North America.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6\\%} \\]"
