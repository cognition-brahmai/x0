        "content": "To create a simple HTTP server in GoLang that responds with the current date and time when a GET request is made to the \"/time\" endpoint, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Go environment**: Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Create a new Go file**: Let's name it `main.go`.\n\n3. **Write the server code**: Use the `net/http` package to handle HTTP requests.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide with the code:\n\n### Step 1: Import necessary packages\n\nYou'll need the `net/http` package for handling HTTP requests and the `time` package to get the current date and time.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the handler function\n\nCreate a handler function that will be called when a GET request is made to the \"/time\" endpoint. This function will write the current date and time to the HTTP response.\n\n```go\nfunc timeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    if r.Method != http.MethodGet {\n        http.Error(w, \"Invalid request method\", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)\n        return\n    }\n    currentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123)\n    fmt.Fprintf(w, \"Current date and time: %s\", currentTime)\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Set up the server routes\n\nRegister the handler function with the \"/time\" endpoint.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/time\", timeHandler)\n    fmt.Println(\"Server is running on port 8080...\")\n    err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Complete Code\n\nPutting it all together, your `main.go` file should look like this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc timeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    if r.Method != http.MethodGet {\n        http.Error(w, \"Invalid request method\", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)\n        return\n    }\n    currentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123)\n    fmt.Fprintf(w, \"Current date and time: %s\", currentTime)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/time\", timeHandler)\n    fmt.Println(\"Server is running on port 8080...\")\n    err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How to run the server\n\n1. **Save the code**: Make sure the code is saved in a file named `main.go`.\n\n2. **Open terminal**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.go`.\n\n3. **Build and run**: Execute the following command to run the server.\n\n    ```sh\n    go run main.go\n    ```\n\n4. **Test the endpoint**: Open a web browser or use a tool like `curl` to make a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/time`. You should see the current date and time displayed.\n\n    Using `curl`:\n\n    ```sh\n    curl http://localhost:8080/time\n    ```\n\nThis simple server demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests and respond with dynamic content in GoLang."
