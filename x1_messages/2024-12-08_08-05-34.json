Swahili is one of its official languages, and Mount Kilimanjaro, which is the highest peak in Africa, is located there. But wait, actually, Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania's neighbor, Kenya, right? Let me double-check that.\n\nOh, no, Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed in Tanzania. I remember now, it's the highest mountain in Africa, and it's in Tanzania. So, Tanzania has Swahili as one of its official languages and is home to Mount Kilimanjaro. That must be the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider other countries in Africa where Swahili is an official language. For example, Kenya also has Swahili as one of its official languages, and it's neighboring Tanzania. But Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania, not in Kenya, correct?\n\nYes, that's right. So, the country we're looking for is Tanzania.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Tanzania}} \\]"
