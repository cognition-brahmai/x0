First, I need to calculate what's inside each set of parentheses.\n\nStarting with the first one: 3^2 - 4. 3^2 means 3 raised to the power of 2, which is 9. So, 9 - 4 equals 5.\n\nNow, the second set of parentheses: 6 + 2, which is simply 8.\n\nSo now, the expression is 5 * 8, which equals 40.\n\nTherefore, (3^2 - 4) * (6 + 2) = 40."
