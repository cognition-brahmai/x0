        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 27 people playing this game where they take turns saying numbers from 1 to 10 in sequence, and then it repeats. I need to find out what number the 27th person says.\n\nFirst, I should understand the pattern. People are saying numbers in a cycle of 10. So, person 1 says 1, person 2 says 2, up to person 10 who says 10. Then, person 11 would say 1 again, person 12 says 2, and so on.\n\nTo find out what number the 27th person says, I can think of it as finding the remainder when 27 is divided by 10, because the sequence repeats every 10 people.\n\nSo, I'll divide 27 by 10:\n\n27 \u00f7 10 = 2 with a remainder of 7.\n\nIn modular arithmetic, this is like finding 27 mod 10, which is 7.\n\nSo, the remainder is 7, which means the 27th person says 7.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes, when dealing with remainders and sequences, it's easy to get off by one.\n\nLet's list out a few to see the pattern:\n\n- Person 1: 1\n\n- Person 2: 2\n\n- Person 3: 3\n\n- Person 4: 4\n\n- Person 5: 5\n\n- Person 6: 6\n\n- Person 7: 7\n\n- Person 8: 8\n\n- Person 9: 9\n\n- Person 10: 10\n\n- Person 11: 1\n\n- Person 12: 2\n\n- ...\n\n- Person 20: 10\n\n- Person 21: 1\n\n- Person 22: 2\n\n- Person 23: 3\n\n- Person 24: 4\n\n- Person 25: 5\n\n- Person 26: 6\n\n- Person 27: 7\n\nYeah, looking at this list, person 27 says 7. So, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the position in the sequence. Since the sequence repeats every 10 people, the number each person says is equal to their position in the group modulo 10, except that when the remainder is 0, it should be 10.\n\nIn this case, 27 divided by 10 is 2 with a remainder of 7, so the number is 7.\n\nIf someone were, say, the 30th person, 30 divided by 10 is 3 with a remainder of 0, which would correspond to 10.\n\nBut in our case, with a remainder of 7, the number is 7.\n\nSo, the 27th person says 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
