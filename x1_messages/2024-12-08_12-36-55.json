However, I can provide you with a sample soliloquy that you can use as inspiration. Please note that this is a fictional piece and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.]\n\nTo be, or not to be\u2014that is the question:\n\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\n\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\n\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\n\nAnd by opposing end them. Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;\n\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\n\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\n\nAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment\n\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\n\nAnd lose the name of action. \u2014Soft you now!\n\nThe fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons\n\nBe all my sins remembered.\n\nWeary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\n\nThe dear repose for limbs acid with toil,\n\nAnd hark! What tongue so sweet as thine can say,\n\n\"Good night, sweet prince\"?\n\nOut, out, brief candle!\n\nLife's but a walking shadow, a poor player\n\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\n\nAnd then is heard no more. It is a tale\n\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\n\nSignifying nothing.\n\nBut, soft! What light through yonder window breaks?\n\nIt is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\n\nArise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\n\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\n\nThat thou her maid art far more fair than she.\n\nBe not her maid, since she is envious.\n\nHer vestal livery is but sick and green\n\nAnd none but fools do wear it; cast it off.\n\nIt is my lady, O, it is my love!\n\nO, that she knew she were!\n\nShe speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?\n\nHer eye discourses; I will answer it.\n\nI am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks.\n\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\n\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\n\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\n\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\n\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\n\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\n\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\n\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\n\nSee, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\n\nO, that I were a glove upon that hand,\n\nThat I might touch that cheek!\n\nBut, soft! What noise? Did I not hear something?\n\nI must be getting back to the castle.\n\nTomorrow is the day of the play,\n\nAnd I must be prepared for it.\n\nBut, O, how weary, stale, flat and unprofitable\n\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\n\nFie on't! O, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden\n\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\n\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\n\nBut two months dead: nay, not so much, not two.\n\nSo excellent a king; that was, to this,\n\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\n\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\n\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\n\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\n\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\n\nBy what it fed on: and yet, within a month\n\n(Eleven days, to be precise), she married my uncle.\n\nMy father's brother, but no more like my father\n\nThan I to Hercules. Within a month:\n\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\n\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\n\nShe married. O, most wicked speed, to post\n\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\n\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\n\nBut break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\n\nWhat is a man, if his chief good and market of his time\n\nBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\n\nSure, he that made us with such large discourse,\n\nLooking before and after, gave us not\n\nThat capability and god-like reason\n\nTo fust in us unused. Now, whether it be\n\nBestial oblivion, or some craven scruple\n\nOf thinking too precisely on the event,\n\nA thought which, quartered, hath but one part wisdom\n\nAnd ever three parts coward, I do not know\n\nWhy yet I live to say \"This thing's to do,\"\n\nSith I have cause and will and strength and means\n\nTo do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:\n\nWitness this army of such mass and charge,\n\nLed by a delicate and tender prince,\n\nWhose spirit with divine ambition puff'd\n\nMakes mouths at the invisible event,\n\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\n\nTo all that fortune, death and danger dare,\n\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\n\nIs not to stir without great argument,\n\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\n\nWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I then,\n\nThat have a father killed, a mother stained,\n\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\n\nAnd let all sleep, while to my shame I see\n\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men,\n\nThat for a fantasy and trick of fame\n\nGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\n\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\n\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\n\nTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth,\n\nMy thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!\n\nBut, in the interim, there is much to do.\n\nI must prepare for the play, and see that all\n\nIs set in order. The players are ready,\n\nAnd I have given them instructions.\n\nBut, O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\n\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\n\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\n\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\n\nThat from her working all his visage wann'd,\n\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspects,\n\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\n\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\n\nFor Hecuba!\n\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\n\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\n\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\n\nThat I have? He would drench the stage with tears\n\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\n\nMake mad the guilty and appal the free,\n\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed\n\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears.\n\nBut I.\n\nAm let to know the causes that move me,\n\nBut not the motives; that I must act,\n\nNot that I must not. Soft you now,\n\nThe fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons\n\nBe all my sins remembered.\n\nI must be getting back.\n\nTomorrow is the play.\n\nI must be up and ready.\n\nBut, O, how weary, stale, flat and unprofitable\n\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\n\nFie on't!

And all for nothing!\n\nFor Hecuba!\n\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\n\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\n\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\n\nThat I have? He would drench the stage with tears\n\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\n\nMake mad the guilty and appal the free,\n\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed\n\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears.\n\nBut I.\n\nAm let to know the causes that move me,\n\nBut not the motives; that I must act,\n\nNot that I must not. Soft you now,\n\nThe fair Ophelia!

O, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden\n\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\n\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\n\nBut two months dead: nay, not so much, not two.\n\nSo excellent a king; that was, to this,\n\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\n\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\n\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\n\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\n\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\n\nBy what it fed on: and yet, within a month\n\n(Eleven days, to be precise), she married my uncle.\n\nMy father's brother, but no more like my father\n\nThan I to Hercules. Within a month:\n\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\n\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\n\nShe married. O, most wicked speed, to post\n\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\n\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\n\nBut break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\n\nWhat is a man, if his chief good and market of his time\n\nBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\n\nSure, he that made us with such large discourse,\n\nLooking before and after, gave us not\n\nThat capability and god-like reason\n\nTo fust in us unused. Now, whether it be\n\nBestial oblivion, or some craven scruple\n\nOf thinking too precisely on the event,\n\nA thought which, quartered, hath but one part wisdom\n\nAnd ever three parts coward, I do not know\n\nWhy yet I live to say \"This thing's to do,\"\n\nSith I have cause and will and strength and means\n\nTo do't.

Rightly to be great\n\nIs not to stir without great argument,\n\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\n\nWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I then,\n\nThat have a father killed, a mother stained,\n\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\n\nAnd let all sleep, while to my shame I see\n\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men,\n\nThat for a fantasy and trick of fame\n\nGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\n\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\n\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\n\nTo hide the slain?

How stand I then,\n\nThat have a father killed, a mother stained,\n\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\n\nAnd let all sleep, while to my shame I see\n\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men,\n\nThat for a fantasy and trick of fame\n\nGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\n\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\n\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\n\nTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth,\n\nMy thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!\n\nBut, in the interim, there is much to do.\n\nI must prepare for the play, and see that all\n\nIs set in order. The players are ready,\n\nAnd I have given them instructions.\n\nBut, O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\n\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\n\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\n\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\n\nThat from her working all his visage wann'd,\n\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspects,\n\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\n\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\n\nFor Hecuba!\n\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\n\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\n\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\n\nThat I have? He would drench the stage with tears\n\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\n\nMake mad the guilty and appal the free,\n\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed\n\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears.\n\nBut I.\n\nAm let to know the causes that move me,\n\nBut not the motives; that I must act,\n\nNot that I must not. Soft you now,\n\nThe fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons\n\nBe all my sins remembered.\n\nI must be getting back.\n\nTomorrow is the play.\n\nI must be up and ready.\n\nBut, O, how weary, stale, flat and unprofitable\n\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\n\nFie on't! O, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden\n\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\n\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\n\nBut two months dead: nay, not so much, not two.\n\nSo excellent a king; that was, to this,\n\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\n\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\n\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\n\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\n\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\n\nBy what it fed on: and yet, within a month\n\n(Eleven days, to be precise), she married my uncle.\n\nMy father's brother, but no more like my father\n\nThan I to Hercules. Within a month:\n\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\n\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\n\nShe married. O, most wicked speed, to post\n\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\n\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\n\nBut break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\n\nWhat is a man, if his chief good and market of his time\n\nBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\n\nSure, he that made us with such large discourse,\n\nLooking before and after, gave us not\n\nThat capability and god-like reason\n\nTo fust in us unused. Now, whether it be\n\nBestial oblivion, or some craven scruple\n\nOf thinking too precisely on the event,\n\nA thought which, quartered, hath but one part wisdom\n\nAnd ever three parts coward, I do not know\n\nWhy yet I live to say \"This thing's to do,\"\n\nSith I have cause and will and strength and means\n\nTo do't.
