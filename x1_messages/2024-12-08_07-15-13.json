        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about three machines in a factory that produce items at different rates. Machine A makes 50 items per hour, Machine B makes 70 items per hour, and Machine C makes 90 items per hour. If all three machines work together for 5 hours, I need to find out how many items they will produce in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many items each machine produces individually in 5 hours and then add them up. That seems straightforward.\n\nStarting with Machine A: it produces 50 items per hour. So, in 5 hours, it would produce 50 items/hour times 5 hours, which is 250 items.\n\nNext, Machine B produces 70 items per hour. In 5 hours, it would produce 70 items/hour times 5 hours, which is 350 items.\n\nThen, Machine C produces 90 items per hour. In 5 hours, it would produce 90 items/hour times 5 hours, which is 450 items.\n\nNow, I'll add up the products of all three machines: 250 items from A plus 350 items from B plus 450 items from C.\n\nLet's add 250 and 350 first: that's 600 items. Then add 450 to that: 600 plus 450 is 1050 items.\n\nSo, together, the three machines will produce 1050 items in 5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe instead of calculating each machine's output separately and then adding them up, I could find the combined production rate of all three machines and then multiply that by the number of hours they work.\n\nLet me try that. The combined production rate would be the sum of the individual rates:\n\nMachine A: 50 items/hour\n\nMachine B: 70 items/hour\n\nMachine C: 90 items/hour\n\nTotal production rate: 50 + 70 + 90 = 210 items per hour.\n\nNow, if they work together for 5 hours, the total production would be 210 items/hour times 5 hours, which is also 1050 items.\n\nOkay, that matches the first method I used. So, both approaches give the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like 1050 is the correct total number of items produced by all three machines working together for 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1050} \\]"
