However, following the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, the entire town was evacuated due to high levels of radiation. The city remains abandoned to this day, serving as a poignant reminder of the disaster.\n\n2. Oradour-sur-Glane, France: This village was destroyed and its inhabitants massacred by German Waffen-SS troops during World War II in 1944. After the war, the village was left in its ruined state as a memorial to the events that took place there.\n\n3. Hashima Island, Japan: Also known as Gunkanjima, this island was once home to one of the world's most densely populated places due to its undersea coal mines. However, as Japan shifted from coal to petroleum, the mines became unprofitable, and the last residents left in 1974.\n\n4. Kolmanskop, Namibia: This German-founded town in the Namib Desert was established in the early 20th century due to a diamond rush. However, as diamond prices fell and the deposits were depleted, the town was abandoned, and now sits buried in sand.\n\n5. Craco, Italy: This medieval village in southern Italy was abandoned due to a series of natural disasters, including earthquakes and landslides, which made the area unsafe for habitation. Today, it is a popular filming location for movies and TV shows."
