        "content": "The substance you're referring to is Radium. Marie Curie, along with her husband Pierre Curie, discovered radium in 1898. It was named after her native country, Poland, which was then part of Russia. \"Radium\" comes from the Latin word \"radius,\" meaning \"ray,\" reflecting its radioactive properties.\n\nMarie Curie's work with radium was groundbreaking. She recognized its potential applications in various fields, including photography and medicine. In photography, radium was used in self-luminous paints, which were popular for creating glow-in-the-dark products like watch dials and instrument panels. In medicine, radium's radioactive properties made it valuable for treating cancer through radiation therapy.\n\nCurie's discovery of radium not only advanced scientific understanding of radioactivity but also had significant practical implications that continue to influence modern technology and medical practices.\n"
