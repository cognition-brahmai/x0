        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that when I select 3 people from a room, each of them speaks a different language. The room has people who speak English, French, and Spanish. Let's see:\n\n- 10 people speak English\n\n- 8 people speak French\n\n- 12 people speak Spanish\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of people in the room. Assuming that these groups are mutually exclusive\u2014meaning no one speaks more than one language\u2014 the total number of people would be 10 + 8 + 12, which is 30 people.\n\nNow, I need to select 3 people out of these 30, and I want each of them to speak a different language. That means one speaks English, one speaks French, and one speaks Spanish.\n\nTo find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to select 3 people out of 30. That's a combination problem, since the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 people out of 30 is:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) = \\frac{30!}{3!(30 - 3)!} = \\frac{30!}{3! \\times 27!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 27! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27!}{3! \\times 27!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3!}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( 3! = 6 \\), it becomes:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n30 divided by 6 is 5, so:\n\n5 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28 = 145 \u00d7 28 = 4060\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check:\n\nActually, 30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28 = 24,360\n\nThen, 24,360 divided by 6 is 4,060.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 people out of 30 is 4,060.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, I need to select one English speaker, one French speaker, and one Spanish speaker.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one English speaker out of 10 is \\( C(10, 1) = 10 \\).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one French speaker out of 8 is \\( C(8, 1) = 8 \\).\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one Spanish speaker out of 12 is \\( C(12, 1) = 12 \\).\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 960\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability \\( P \\) that all three selected people speak different languages is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{960}{4060}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{960 \\div 20}{4060 \\div 20} = \\frac{48}{203}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{48}{203} \\).\n\nBut wait a minute, I should check if there's any other way to approach this problem, maybe using permutations or considering the order.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the selection step by step.\n\nFirst, select any person. The probability that the first person speaks English is \\( \\frac{10}{30} \\), French is \\( \\frac{8}{30} \\), and Spanish is \\( \\frac{12}{30} \\). But since I don't care about the order, it might complicate things.\n\nOr, I could consider the first person selected, then the second, then the third, and calculate the probabilities step by step, multiplying them together.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nAssume I select the first person. There are 30 choices, and I don't care what language they speak yet.\n\nThen, the second person should speak a different language than the first.\n\nAnd the third person should speak a different language than both the first and second.\n\nWait, but in this approach, the order matters, so I need to consider permutations.\n\nAlternatively, since in combinations, order doesn't matter, my initial approach should be sufficient.\n\nBut let's verify the numbers.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 3 people out of 30 is indeed \\( C(30, 3) = 4060 \\).\n\nNumber of ways to choose one from each language group is \\( 10 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 960 \\).\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{960}{4060} = \\frac{48}{203} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a decimal to get a sense of its magnitude.\n\n\\( 48 \\div 203 \\) is approximately 0.236, or 23.6%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 23.6% chance that all three selected people speak different languages.\n\nIs there any other way to confirm this?\n\nPerhaps using the concept of combinations for each language group.\n\nYes, that's what I did initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that the three selected people must be one from each group, with no two from the same group.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to subtract the probabilities of unwanted events from 1.\n\nUnwanted events would be:\n\n1. All three speak the same language.\n\n2. Two speak the same language, and the third speaks a different one.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nLet's see:\n\nProbability that all three speak the same language:\n\n- All English: \\( C(10, 3) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\n- All French: \\( C(8, 3) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\n- All Spanish: \\( C(12, 3) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\nSimilarly, probability that exactly two speak the same language and the third speaks a different one:\n\n- Two English and one French: \\( C(10, 2) \\times C(8, 1) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\n- Two English and one Spanish: \\( C(10, 2) \\times C(12, 1) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\n- Two French and one English: \\( C(8, 2) \\times C(10, 1) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\n- Two French and one Spanish: \\( C(8, 2) \\times C(12, 1) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\n- Two Spanish and one English: \\( C(12, 2) \\times C(10, 1) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\n- Two Spanish and one French: \\( C(12, 2) \\times C(8, 1) / C(30, 3) \\)\n\nThen, the probability of all three speaking different languages would be 1 minus the sum of the probabilities of all these unwanted events.\n\nBut that seems more tedious. Given that my initial approach gave me \\( \\frac{48}{203} \\), I'll stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the probability step by step, considering the selection without replacement.\n\nFirst, the probability that the first person speaks English is \\( \\frac{10}{30} \\), French is \\( \\frac{8}{30} \\), and Spanish is \\( \\frac{12}{30} \\).\n\nThen, given that the first person speaks English, the probability that the second speaks French is \\( \\frac{8}{29} \\), and then the third speaks Spanish is \\( \\frac{12}{28} \\).\n\nSimilarly, if the first speaks French, then second speaks English, and third speaks Spanish, and so on.\n\nBut this approach would involve considering all possible orders, which would be more time-consuming but should give the same result.\n\nLet me try it quickly.\n\nPossible orders for selecting one of each language:\n\n1. English, French, Spanish\n\n2. English, Spanish, French\n\n3. French, English, Spanish\n\n4. French, Spanish, English\n\n5. Spanish, English, French\n\n6. Spanish, French, English\n\nFor each order, the probability is the product of the probabilities at each step, given the previous selections.\n\nFor example, for English, French, Spanish:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{E,F,S}) = \\frac{10}{30} \\times \\frac{8}{29} \\times \\frac{12}{28}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for English, Spanish, French:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{E,S,F}) = \\frac{10}{30} \\times \\frac{12}{29} \\times \\frac{8}{28}\n\\]\n\nAnd so on for the other orders.\n\nNotice that the numerators and denominators are the same, just the order of multiplication changes.\n\nSince multiplication is commutative, each of these probabilities is equal to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{30} \\times \\frac{8}{29} \\times \\frac{12}{28}\n\\]\n\nThere are 6 such orders, so the total probability is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\left( \\frac{10}{30} \\times \\frac{8}{29} \\times \\frac{12}{28} \\right)\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\( \\frac{10}{30} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{8}{29} \\) remains as is.\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{12}{28} = \\frac{3}{7} \\)\n\nSo, the product inside the parentheses is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{29} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{1 \\times 8 \\times 3}{3 \\times 29 \\times 7} = \\frac{24}{609}\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{24}{609} \\):\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{203}\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 6:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\frac{8}{203} = \\frac{48}{203}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed \\( \\frac{48}{203} \\).\n\nThis confirms that my initial approach was correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\( \\frac{48}{203} \\), or approximately 23.6%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{48}{203}} \\]"
