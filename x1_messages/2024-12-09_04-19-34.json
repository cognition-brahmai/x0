The pumps are finally working, sending a mixture of water and waste back into Lake Pontchartrain. It\\'s going to take weeks to do the job and all that\\'s left behind will not be pretty. In the submerged city, a story of survival goes on. The old, the sick, the tired just being rescued, while others are refusing to leave. And in Mississippi, thousands are left homeless after Katrina. Is federal red tape keeping them from getting a temporary place to live? MILES O\\'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning and welcome. Here are the latest mission critical issues in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. New Orleans police say the city is absolutely destroyed. They\\'re urging anyone left in the city to get out, saying there are no jobs, no homes, no food, no reason to stay. Mayor Ray Nagin said that officers will no longer give water to people who refuse to evacuate. Government officials have delayed plans to move 4, 000 evacuees in Houston to cruise ships off the coast of Galveston. They said evacuees told them they would rather stay put for now and focus on finding their loved ones or other places to stay. Meanwhile, Mississippi struggling to find long-term shelter for tens of thousands of evacuees. Senator Trent Lott called on President Bush to authorize the immediate release of 20, 000 trailers sitting idle in Atlanta. Lott said FEMA has refused to ship the trailers because of red tape and paperwork. And the Army Corps of Engineers has closed the breaches in two levees in New Orleans. Water now being pumped out of the city, as we\\'ve been telling you. The process could take 30 days, or perhaps much longer. All of that, of course, weather dependent, as well. Back to Soledad in New Orleans -- good morning, Soledad. S. O\\'BRIEN: All right, good morning to you, Miles. Two things that you mentioned there are directly related to where I am today. You know, as you say, Mayor Ray Nagin said they\\'re not going to hand out water to the people who refuse to leave. It\\'s going to be a huge problem. As we were flying over the area -- and we covered the entire scope that\\'s been flooded by helicopter -- there are lots of people who are out on their porches, a large number, just refusing to leave. We\\'ll see what he\\'s claiming he\\'s going to do is going to do to that. And, of course, you talk about federal red tape, we\\'ve heard that story over and over again, as well. There are sheriffs deputies who say we came to help out. We wanted to help and we were turned away; they said they didn\\'t need anything, even as our colleagues were calling us saying please help us out, please help us out. So today we\\'re going to tell you about some of those folks who have now been rescued. In fact, we\\'re on a rescue area ramp. This is the on ramp at the Elysian Fields exit off of I-10, which is right over my head. They\\'ll be working here soon. The boats will start coming in. And they basically will rescue people, bring them here and then transport them out of the city now that the police want everybody out. Also, after a meeting with President Bush, the governor, Blanco, Kathleen Blanco, says they are united. They\\'re working as a team. She, though, is still blaming the Feds for their slow response. GOV. KATHLEEN BLANCO: The mayor and I were both asking for the same thing. We wanted troops. We wanted food. We wanted water. We wanted helicopters. We asked for that early in the week. I asked for everything that we have available from the federal government. I got it from the National Guard. I got as much as possible. And the federal effort was just a little slow in coming. I can\\'t understand why. You know, those are questions that are yet to be answered. S. O\\'BRIEN: That\\'s Governor Kathleen Blanco, who\\'s standing with the former FEMA director, James Lee Witt, by her side. They\\'re now working together as a team. Let\\'s get right to Deb Feyerick. She\\'s been covering the story from Baton Rouge, which, of course, is where the governor is -- good morning to you, Deb. DEBORAH FEYERICK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Soledad. Well, we can tell you when the president came to town yesterday, it began as a very frosty morning, a very chilly morning. But by the end of the afternoon, it seemed that everybody was on the same page. The meeting between the president and the governor, I asked the governor about it, she said that the president really reinforced that they were going to work together, that this was a no nonsense opportunity to get things done and get things built. The message then coming out of the White House was that everybody was unified, everybody was on the same page. The governor using words like \"shoulder to shoulder\" and \"hand in hand.\" So it seems as if, at least for now, everyone is playing nice. FEYERICK (voice-over): When the president touched down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\\'s governor was there to meet him. It wouldn\\'t have seemed strange, except the governor hadn\\'t exactly been invited by the White House. A White House official explains, saying they left messages for Governor Blanco, but didn\\'t hear back. The governor\\'s staff categorically denies receiving any calls and says they officially found out at 6:00 Monday morning, after placing a call to the White House chief of staff. The president and governor have been at odds over the National Guard. The president wanted troops to be controlled under the military. The governor wanted to keep the troops under her control, so they could be used to keep the peace, even shoot if they had to. They can\\'t shoot except in self-defense once they\\'re federalized. After an hour-and-a-half long meeting, it seemed everyone was ready to say they were on the same page, from the White House... MICHAEL CHERTOFF, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We have to have a unified headquarters. We will all be next to each other. The execution will be, I think, as somebody said, seamless. FEYERICK: To the governor. BLANCO: We are partners in this effort. We are a team. And I want to say it again, we are a team. We\\'re a powerful team, because we have everything it takes now to make this work like a finely oiled machine. FEYERICK: Disagreements put aside, at least in public. FEYERICK: And it\\'s very clear from here on the ground that both sides have very, very strong teams in place. The governor has brought in reinforcements to advise her, to counsel her during this crisis. Obviously, the White House has very powerful people looking after this effort. Both sides making sure that things are going to get done. They just have to now do it together and they\\'re saying that that\\'s what\\'s going to happen now that people are on the ground. Everybody is focused on moving forward and restoring some sort of vision of hope -- Soledad. S. O\\'BRIEN: Well, I\\'ll tell you, with the massive disaster that is here on the ground, there is going to be lots of blame to go around. And, also, at some point they\\'re going to have to clear up the story of what exactly happened. How exactly was the ball dropped and who exactly is to blame? Deb Feyerick for us this morning. Thanks, Deb. Appreciate it. Let\\'s get back to Miles. M. O\\'BRIEN: Thanks very much, Soledad. In Mississippi, tens of thousands of hurricane victims are homeless and hungry this morning. Relief aid is getting through, but some state officials say bureaucratic red tape is slowing the progress. You hear a recurrent theme here this morning? Chris Huntington live in Biloxi -- Chris, tell us about the effort there. CHRIS HUNTINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Miles, a recurring question we\\'re hearing from all sorts of folks here, whether it\\'s civilians or law enforcement or even military, is who\\'s in charge? I\\'ll get to that specifically in a second. Let me tell you where I am. I am in front of what is now being called Camp Restore. Directly behind me is a naval amphibious unit out of Norfolk, Virginia. Just down the beach here in Biloxi, a sizable element from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, made a rather dramatic amphibious landing yesterday. More than 100 Marine soldiers on the ground right now with all sorts of heavy duty equipment to do, frankly, whatever is needed. I have asked several of the soldiers what is your mission here? And that is simply the response -- we are here to do whatever we can. For instance, a navy cook is going to one of the shelters here in Biloxi to help serve hot meals to folks that need it. The heavy equipment, big bulldozers and such, obviously useful in clearing the debris. And, furthermore, they are very helpful in restoring order here. As we\\'ve been saying for the last couple of days, the basic state of emergency here in Mississippi has stabilized. Folks are getting essential elements -- food and water and some sanitation. But very few people around here have had a hot meal for more than a week. And that\\'s going to be a long time in coming. Now, back to the issue of who\\'s in charge. Throughout the hurricane region, but let\\'s just take here in Biloxi, you\\'ve got people flooding in from all over the region and the country. For instance, this morning we met a sheriff from Lansing, Michigan who is an advanced scout for the Red Cross convoy that is making its way down from Michigan with supplies. He\\'s trying to find out where they should set up. He encountered a police officer from Biloxi, asked the simple question who\\'s in charge, where do I go? He didn\\'t get a simple answer because, in part, you can\\'t necessarily reach the people who are in charge. Now, here in this part of Mississippi, there is a fairly direct chain of command, ultimately run by the Harrison County emergency operations center. So they do have a sort of county by county operations system here. But, still, Miles, very cumbersome to find out exactly who is in control, exactly what all of these folks should be doing. There are a lot of folks here to help. It\\'s not always easy to find out where they should go or get the message to the people they\\'re trying to help -- Miles. M. O\\'BRIEN: Communication and coordination, it\\'s the big problem. Chris Huntington, thanks very much. Let\\'s check the headlines now. Carol Costello here with that -- good morning, Carol. CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. Good morning to all of you. Now in the news, coalition troops in Iraq have launched air strikes against perpetrated al Qaeda sites. The U.S. military says troops are pounding bridges in the Al Anbar Province. The sites were believed to be used to move foreign fighters and equipment across the Euphrates River Valley into central Iraq. In the meantime, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan is warning that Iraq has become a hub for terrorism. The secretary general calls Iraq an even greater threat for terrorism than Afghanistan was under the Taliban. He says young Muslims are angry at what the United States is doing in Iraq. Annan also said he\\'s ready for more criticism of the United Nations when the final report on the Oil For Food scandal is published on Wednesday. In about two hours, Chief Justice William Rehnquist\\'s coffin will be brought to the Supreme Court. Rehnquist\\'s body will lie in repose for two days, during which time the public is invited to pay their respects. Rehnquist will be buried tomorrow afternoon at Arlington National Cemetery, following a funeral at St. Matthew\\'s Cathedral in Washington. In the meantime, the Senate is expected to announce today when it will hold confirmation hearings for Rehnquist\\'s proposed successor, John Roberts. Hearings had been scheduled for today, but that changed because of Rehnquist\\'s death and hurricane Katrina. And football fans across the country are saying a sad good-bye to one legendary receiver, the hardest working man in football and the nicest man. Jerry Rice announced his retirement on Monday. Rice helped lead the San Francisco 49ers to three Super Bowl titles in the 1980s and \\'90s. He was hoping to finish out his career in a key role with the Denver Broncos, but was told over the weekend he would not be a top receiver so he walked. Jerry Rice is 42 years old, Chad. And he said he really wanted to make the team, but since he wasn\\'t going to see much playing time, he would leave it to the younger players. CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: You know, so many times we beat up on players because, oh, they\\'re not a role model, blah, blah, blah. But the man there was one that was right there. COSTELLO: So hard working. Always in shape. MYERS: Yes. COSTELLO: Always ready to play. MYERS: He sure was. And 42. COSTELLO: Yes. MYERS: You know? OK. Let\\'s sit down, have some fun in your retirement. Buy a boat and do some fishing. M. O\\'BRIEN: Still to come on AMERICAN MORNING, we\\'re going to talk to singer/songwriter Paul Simon. We\\'ll find out what he\\'s doing to help doctors treat the victims of Katrina. Plus, hundreds of evacuees overwhelmed by the generosity of one small town. We\\'ll show you what the town is doing to ease some of their suffering. Stay with us for more AMERICAN MORNING.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
