Below is a Python script that implements the Merge Sort algorithm to sort a list of integers.\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) > 1:\n        mid = len(arr) // 2  # Finding the mid of the array\n        left = arr[:mid]     # Dividing the array elements into 2 halves\n        right = arr[mid:]\n\n        merge_sort(left)     # Sorting the first half\n        merge_sort(right)    # Sorting the second half\n\n        i = j = k = 0\n\n        # Copy data to temp arrays left[] and right[]\n        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n            if left[i] < right[j]:\n                arr[k] = left[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                arr[k] = right[j]\n                j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Checking if any element was left\n        while i < len(left):\n            arr[k] = left[i]\n            i += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        while j < len(right):\n            arr[k] = right[j]\n            j += 1\n            k += 1\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = input(\"Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: \")\n    input_list = input_str.split()\n    arr = [int(num) for num in input_list]\n    \n    print(\"Original array:\", arr)\n    merge_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", arr)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **merge_sort function**:\n   - This function sorts the array using the merge sort algorithm.\n   - It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges them back together.\n\n2. **main function**:\n   - This function handles the input and output.\n   - It reads a list of integers from the user, converts them into a list of integers, and then calls the merge_sort function to sort the list.\n   - Finally, it prints the original and sorted arrays.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - The script starts by taking input from the user.\n   - It then sorts the input list using the merge_sort function and displays both the original and sorted lists.\n\nYou can run this script in any Python environment. Just copy the code, paste it into a Python file (e.g., `merge_sort.py`), and run it. The script will prompt you to enter a list of integers, which it will then sort using the merge sort algorithm."
