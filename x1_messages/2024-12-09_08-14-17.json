I have had the privilege of knowing Luke for several years now, and I can confidently say that he possesses the qualities and potential necessary to become a great Jedi.\n\nLuke is a young man of exceptional character and integrity. He has shown great courage and bravery in the face of adversity, often putting himself in harm's way to protect others. His unwavering sense of justice and his commitment to doing what is right, even when it is difficult, make him an ideal candidate for the Jedi Academy.\n\nIn addition to his character, Luke has demonstrated a natural talent for the Force. He has shown an innate ability to connect with the Force and use it to enhance his skills and abilities. His dedication to honing his skills and mastering the Force is evident in his daily practice and his willingness to learn from those around him.\n\nFurthermore, Luke has shown great potential in his combat skills. He is skilled with a lightsaber and has proven himself in battle on multiple occasions. His strategic thinking and quick reflexes make him a valuable asset in any fight.\n\nI believe that Luke has the potential to become one of the greatest Jedi of our time. With his strong character, natural talent for the Force, and combat skills, he has everything he needs to succeed in the Jedi Academy. I wholeheartedly recommend him for admission and am confident that he will make a positive contribution to the Jedi Order.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDarth Vader"
