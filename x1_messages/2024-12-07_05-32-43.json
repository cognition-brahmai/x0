        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a chemist who needs to make a 20% salt solution by mixing a 10% salt solution with a 40% salt solution. The goal is to end up with 50 liters of the 20% solution. We need to figure out how many liters of each starting solution to mix together to get there.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let's say:\n\n- \\( x \\) = liters of the 10% salt solution\n\n- \\( y \\) = liters of the 40% salt solution\n\nOur target is to have a total of 50 liters, so:\n\n\\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\nThis is our first equation.\n\nNow, we also need to consider the amount of salt in each solution. The total amount of salt from both solutions should equal the amount of salt in the final 20% solution.\n\nThe amount of salt in the 10% solution is \\( 0.10x \\), and in the 40% solution, it's \\( 0.40y \\). The final solution has 20% salt in 50 liters, which is \\( 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\) liters of salt.\n\nSo, the equation for the salt amounts is:\n\n\\( 0.10x + 0.40y = 10 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( 0.10x + 0.40y = 10 \\)\n\nI think I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\( x = 50 - y \\)\n\nNow, plug this into equation 2:\n\n\\( 0.10(50 - y) + 0.40y = 10 \\)\n\nLet's distribute the 0.10:\n\n\\( 5 - 0.10y + 0.40y = 10 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 5 + 0.30y = 10 \\)\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.30y = 5 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.30:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{0.30} = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.67 \\) liters\n\nSo, \\( y \\approx 16.67 \\) liters of the 40% solution.\n\nNow, plug this back into equation 1 to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 50 - 16.67 \\approx 33.33 \\) liters\n\nTherefore, the chemist should mix approximately 33.33 liters of the 10% salt solution with approximately 16.67 liters of the 40% salt solution to obtain 50 liters of a 20% salt solution.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this makes sense. If we have more of the 10% solution than the 40% solution, it makes sense that the final concentration would be closer to 10% than to 40%, which it is, at 20%.\n\nAlso, let's verify the calculations to make sure there are no errors.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\n\\( 0.10x + 0.40y = 10 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 50 - y \\):\n\n\\( 0.10(50 - y) + 0.40y = 10 \\)\n\n\\( 5 - 0.10y + 0.40y = 10 \\)\n\n\\( 5 + 0.30y = 10 \\)\n\n\\( 0.30y = 5 \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{0.30} = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.67 \\) liters\n\nThen, \\( x = 50 - 16.67 \\approx 33.33 \\) liters\n\nNow, let's check if these amounts give us the correct amount of salt.\n\nSalt from 10% solution: \\( 0.10 \\times 33.33 \\approx 3.333 \\) liters\n\nSalt from 40% solution: \\( 0.40 \\times 16.67 \\approx 6.667 \\) liters\n\nTotal salt: \\( 3.333 + 6.667 = 10 \\) liters\n\nWhich is exactly what we need for a 20% solution of 50 liters, since \\( 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\) liters.\n\nSo, the solution seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the concept of weighted averages or alligation method to find the ratio of the two solutions to be mixed.\n\nUsing alligation:\n\nWe have two solutions: 10% and 40%, and we want to make 20%.\n\nThe difference between the stronger solution and the desired solution is \\( 40\\% - 20\\% = 20\\% \\)\n\nThe difference between the desired solution and the weaker solution is \\( 20\\% - 10\\% = 10\\% \\)\n\nSo, the ratio of the weaker to stronger solution is \\( \\frac{20\\%}{10\\%} = 2:1 \\)\n\nThis means for every 2 parts of the 10% solution, we need 1 part of the 40% solution.\n\nGiven that the total volume is 50 liters, we can set up the equation:\n\nLet the number of parts be \\( p \\), so \\( 2p + p = 50 \\)\n\n\\( 3p = 50 \\)\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.67 \\) liters\n\nTherefore:\n\n- 10% solution: \\( 2p \\approx 33.33 \\) liters\n\n- 40% solution: \\( p \\approx 16.67 \\) liters\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the chemist needs to mix approximately 33.33 liters of the 10% salt solution with approximately 16.67 liters of the 40% salt solution to obtain 50 liters of a 20% salt solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33.33 \\text{ liters of 10% solution and } 16.67 \\text{ liters of 40% solution}} \\]"
