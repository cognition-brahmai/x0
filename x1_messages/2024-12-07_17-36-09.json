        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 200 cars, and on average, 75% of them are rented out daily. So, first, I need to find out how many cars are rented each day.\n\nIf 75% of 200 cars are rented daily, then the number of cars rented per day is:\n\n0.75 * 200 = 150 cars per day.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many days it will take for the company to rent out 1,000 cars, with each customer renting a car for one day only. Since 150 cars are rented each day, I can find the number of days by dividing the total number of cars to be rented by the number of cars rented per day.\n\nSo, number of days = 1,000 / 150.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1,000 \u00f7 150 = 6.6667 days.\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a day in this context, I suppose they would need 7 full days to rent out at least 1,000 cars.\n\nBut wait, let's check that. In 6 days, they would rent out 6 * 150 = 900 cars. On the 7th day, they would rent out another 150 cars, bringing the total to 1,050 cars. So, yes, in 7 days, they would have rented out 1,050 cars, which is more than 1,000.\n\nHowever, if they need exactly 1,000 cars, they would reach that on the 7th day, but before the end of the 7th day. Since each day they rent out 150 cars, to find out exactly when they reach 1,000, I can calculate:\n\nTotal cars rented after x days = 150x.\n\nSet that equal to 1,000:\n\n150x = 1,000\n\nx = 1,000 / 150 = 6.6667 days.\n\nSo, they would reach 1,000 cars rented somewhere in the 7th day. But since the question is about whole days, I think the answer is 7 days.\n\nAlternatively, if the company can rent out cars fractionally within a day, then it would take approximately 6.67 days, but since the question specifies that each customer rents a car for one day only, I think it's safer to go with whole days.\n\nTherefore, it will take 7 days for the company to rent out 1,000 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
