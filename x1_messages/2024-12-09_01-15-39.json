        "content": "To find the median of a list of numbers in Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sort the list**: The median is the middle value in a sorted list. So, first, you need to sort the list of numbers.\n\n2. **Find the middle value**:\n   - If the list has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle number.\n   - If the list has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation of this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_median(numbers):\n    # First, sort the list\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    \n    # Find the number of elements\n    n = len(sorted_numbers)\n    \n    # If the number of elements is odd\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        # The median is the middle element\n        median = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\n    else:\n        # The median is the average of the two middle elements\n        mid1 = sorted_numbers[(n // 2) - 1]\n        mid2 = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\n        median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2\n    \n    return median\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting the List**:\n   - We use the `sorted()` function to sort the list of numbers. This ensures that the numbers are in ascending order.\n\n2. **Calculating the Median**:\n   - We determine the number of elements in the list (`n`).\n   - If `n` is odd, the median is the element at index `n//2` (since list indices start at 0).\n   - If `n` is even, the median is the average of the elements at indices `(n//2) - 1` and `n//2`.\n\nThis function will correctly compute the median for any list of numbers provided to it."
