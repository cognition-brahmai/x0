        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. So, we've got a hotel with 500 rooms, and each room can have either one king-size bed or two queen-size beds. The management wants at least 60% of the rooms to have two queen-size beds. We need to find the minimum number of rooms with two queen-size beds and the maximum number of rooms with one king-size bed. Also, we have to estimate the total cost of furnishing all the rooms, given that a king-size bed costs $1,000 and a queen-size bed costs $800.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum number of rooms with two queen-size beds. Since at least 60% of the rooms must have two queen-size beds, we can calculate 60% of 500 rooms:\n\n0.60 * 500 = 300 rooms\n\nSo, the minimum number of rooms with two queen-size beds is 300.\n\nNext, to find the maximum number of rooms with one king-size bed, we need to consider that if 300 rooms have two queen-size beds, then the remaining rooms can have one king-size bed. So:\n\nTotal rooms - rooms with two queen-size beds = rooms with one king-size bed\n\n500 - 300 = 200 rooms\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of rooms with one king-size bed is 200.\n\nNow, let's estimate the total cost of furnishing all the rooms. We need to calculate the cost for both types of rooms and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the rooms with two queen-size beds:\n\nEach of these rooms has two queen-size beds, and each queen-size bed costs $800.\n\nSo, cost per room with two queen-size beds = 2 * $800 = $1,600\n\nSince there are 300 such rooms:\n\nTotal cost for rooms with two queen-size beds = 300 * $1,600 = $480,000\n\nNext, for the rooms with one king-size bed:\n\nEach of these rooms has one king-size bed, which costs $1,000.\n\nSo, cost per room with one king-size bed = $1,000\n\nWith 200 such rooms:\n\nTotal cost for rooms with one king-size bed = 200 * $1,000 = $200,000\n\nNow, to find the total cost of furnishing all the rooms, we add the two amounts together:\n\nTotal cost = $480,000 + $200,000 = $680,000\n\nTherefore, the total cost of furnishing all 500 rooms is $680,000.\n\nJust to double-check, let's make sure we've considered all the details. We know that at least 60% of the rooms must have two queen-size beds, and we've used exactly 60%, which is the minimum required. If the hotel were to have more rooms with two queen-size beds, the number of rooms with king-size beds would decrease, but since we're looking for the maximum number of king-size bed rooms, 200 is indeed the maximum allowed under this constraint.\n\nAlso, in calculating the costs, we've assumed that each room has only the specified beds and no additional furniture costs are considered. If there were other furniture items, we'd need to include those in the total cost, but based on the information provided, we've covered the bed costs appropriately.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Minimum number of rooms with two queen-size beds: 300\n\n- Maximum number of rooms with one king-size bed: 200\n\n- Total cost of furnishing all rooms: $680,000\n\nI hope this helps!
