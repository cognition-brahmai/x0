        "content": "So there are 5 apples on the table, and John takes away 2 apples. To find out how many apples are left, I need to subtract the number of apples John took from the total number of apples that were there initially.\n\nSo, starting with 5 apples, and John takes away 2, that means 5 minus 2, which equals 3 apples left on the table.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this again. Maybe there's more to it. What if John took away 2 apples, but then someone else added more apples to the table? Or perhaps John took away 2 apples but then put one back? The problem says \"John takes away 2 apples,\" so probably that's all that happened.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apples are of different kinds, and the question is trying to trick me by considering different types of apples. But no, the question is straightforward: there are 5 apples, John takes 2, how many are left?\n\nI think the answer is simply 3 apples left.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation. Maybe the apples are being divided among people, or perhaps John taking away 2 apples affects the number in some other way. No, that seems unlikely. The problem is pretty straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is 3 apples are left on the table.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
