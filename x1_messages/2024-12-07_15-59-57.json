Dogs have an incredible ability to detect scents that are imperceptible to humans, which makes them invaluable in finding lost or trapped individuals in various environments such as forests, mountains, urban areas, and even underwater. Their keen sense of smell allows them to track scents over long distances and in different conditions, making them a crucial asset in search and rescue missions."
