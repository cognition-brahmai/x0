        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class with 12 students, and each student is part of either the debate team or the chess club. It's also given that there are twice as many students in the debate team as there are in the chess club. We need to find out how many students are in each group.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to represent the number of students in each group. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of students in the chess club.\n\n- Since there are twice as many students in the debate team as in the chess club, the number of students in the debate team would be \\( 2c \\).\n\nNow, we know that the total number of students in the class is 12, and every student is in either the debate team or the chess club. So, the sum of the students in both groups should equal 12. We can write this as an equation:\n\n\\[ c + 2c = 12 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 3c = 12 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( c \\), we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, there are 4 students in the chess club. Since the debate team has twice as many students as the chess club, the number of students in the debate team is:\n\n\\[ 2c = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 4 students in the chess club and 8 students in the debate team.\n\nTo double-check, we can add the number of students in both groups: 4 + 8 = 12, which matches the total number of students in the class. Also, 8 is indeed twice as many as 4, so the condition is satisfied.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ students in chess club and } 8 \\text{ students in debate team}} \\]"
