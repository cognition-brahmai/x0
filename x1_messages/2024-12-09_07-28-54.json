        "content": "To determine how many 1-meter square tiles are needed to cover the entire floor of a rectangular room that measures 12 meters in length and 8 meters in width, we need to calculate the area of the room and then divide that by the area of one tile.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the room. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the length is 12 meters and the width is 8 meters, we have:\n\n\\[\nA = 12 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 8 \\, \\text{meters} = 96 \\, \\text{square meters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 1-meter square tiles are required to cover this area. Since each tile covers 1 square meter, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the floor.\n\nTherefore, the number of tiles required is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of tiles} = \\frac{\\text{area of the room}}{\\text{area of one tile}} = \\frac{96 \\, \\text{square meters}}{1 \\, \\text{square meter/tile}} = 96 \\, \\text{tiles}\n\\]\n\nSo, you will need 96 tiles to cover the entire floor of the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
