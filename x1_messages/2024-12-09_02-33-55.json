        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a train traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and we need to find out how far it goes in 2 hours and 30 minutes. Okay, first things first, I need to recall the basic formula that connects speed, time, and distance.\n\nI remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time, or d = s * t. That seems straightforward. So, if the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 2 hours and 30 minutes, I just need to plug in these values into the formula.\n\nBut wait, time is given in hours and minutes, and speed is in miles per hour. Hmm, I think I need to make sure that the units are consistent. Since speed is in miles per hour, it would be best to convert the time entirely into hours.\n\nSo, 2 hours and 30 minutes... 30 minutes is half an hour, so total time is 2.5 hours. Now, plugging into the formula: d = 60 mph * 2.5 hours. Let's do the math: 60 times 2 is 120, and 60 times 0.5 is 30, so total distance is 150 miles.\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. But maybe there are other ways to approach this problem. Let's think about it differently. What if I break down the time into hours and minutes separately and calculate the distance for each part then add them up.\n\nSo, for the 2 hours, at 60 miles per hour, the distance would be 60 * 2 = 120 miles. For the remaining 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, the distance would be 60 * 0.5 = 30 miles. Adding them together, 120 + 30 = 150 miles. Same answer as before.\n\nAnother way could be to think in terms of rates. If the train travels 60 miles in one hour, then in half an hour it would travel half of that, which is 30 miles. So, in 2 hours, it's 120 miles, plus 30 miles for the half hour, totaling 150 miles again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use proportions. If 1 hour corresponds to 60 miles, then 2.5 hours would correspond to x miles. So, setting up a proportion: 1/60 = 2.5/x. Wait, actually, that should be 60 miles per hour, so it's better to stick with the original formula.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more complex way to solve this, maybe involving calculus. But since this is a straightforward problem with constant speed, using calculus would be overkill. The basic formula is sufficient and accurate.\n\nI could also think about converting everything into smaller units, like minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the speed is 60 miles per 60 minutes, which is 1 mile per minute. Now, 2 hours and 30 minutes is 150 minutes. So, at 1 mile per minute, in 150 minutes, the train would travel 150 miles. That's another way to get to the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be fancy, I could use the formula for distance in terms of velocity and time, considering velocity as a vector, but since we're dealing with scalar speed and straight-line motion, that wouldn't add any value and might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nSo, summarizing the methods I've considered:\n\n1. Using the formula d = s * t with time in hours: d = 60 mph * 2.5 hours = 150 miles.\n\n2. Breaking down time into hours and minutes, calculating separately, then summing: 60 * 2 + 60 * 0.5 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles.\n\n3. Using the rate approach: half an hour is half of 60 miles, which is 30 miles, plus 120 miles for 2 hours.\n\n4. Using proportions: setting up 1 hour to 60 miles as 2.5 hours to x miles, solving for x gives 150 miles.\n\n5. Converting units to minutes: 60 miles per 60 minutes, so 1 mile per minute, totaling 150 miles in 150 minutes.\n\nNow, ranking these methods based on clarity and accuracy:\n\n1. **Using the formula d = s * t**: This is the most direct and accurate method. It's clear, requires minimal steps, and directly applies the fundamental relationship between speed, time, and distance.\n\n2. **Breaking down time into hours and minutes**: This method is also accurate and provides a step-by-step breakdown that can be helpful for understanding. It's a bit more verbose but achieves the same result.\n\n3. **Rate approach**: Similar to the breakdown method, this is intuitive and can be helpful for those who prefer thinking in terms of rates rather than formulas.\n\n4. **Proportions**: Setting up a proportion is another valid approach, especially for those who might not remember the formula but understand the relationship between time and distance.\n\n5. **Converting units to minutes**: This method is accurate but involves an extra step of converting speed to miles per minute, which might be unnecessary for this problem.\n\nGiven these considerations, the top solution is to use the formula d = s * t, ensuring that time is in the same units as the speed. In this case, converting 2 hours and 30 minutes to 2.5 hours and multiplying by 60 mph gives the distance of 150 miles directly.\n\nThis method is not only accurate but also efficient, making it the preferred approach for solving this type of problem."
