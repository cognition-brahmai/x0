        "content": "Pterosaurs are often mistakenly considered flying dinosaurs, but they are actually a separate group of reptiles. While both pterosaurs and dinosaurs lived during the Mesozoic Era, they belong to different clades. Pterosaurs are part of the clade Pterosauria, which is closely related to dinosaurs but distinct from them. Dinosaurs include birds and non-avian dinosaurs, but pterosaurs are not considered dinosaurs. They are, however, often studied in the context of dinosaur research due to their temporal overlap and evolutionary relationships."
