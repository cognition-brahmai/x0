        "content": "So I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 8 men and 5 women, and there has to be at least one woman on the committee. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of ways to choose 3 people from a group of 13 (since 8 men + 5 women = 13 people) without any restrictions is given by the combination formula. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose any 3 people from 13 would be C(13, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13 - 3)!) = (13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (3! \u00d7 10!)) = (13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (1716) / 6 = 286.\n\nSo, there are 286 ways to choose any 3 people from 13.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that there's at least one woman on the committee. That means I can't have all men on the committee. So, maybe I can find out the total number of ways to choose 3 people and subtract the number of ways to choose 3 men (which would be no women).\n\nLet me find out how many ways there are to choose 3 men from 8 men. That would be C(8, 3):\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8 - 3)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (3! \u00d7 5!)) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 336 / 6 = 56.\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose 3 men.\n\nNow, to find the number of ways to choose a committee with at least one woman, I can subtract the all-men committees from the total committees:\n\nTotal committees - all-men committees = 286 - 56 = 230.\n\nSo, there are 230 ways to choose a committee of 3 people with at least one woman.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can think about it by considering the different scenarios for the number of women on the committee.\n\nScenario 1: Exactly one woman and two men.\n\nScenario 2: Exactly two women and one man.\n\nScenario 3: Exactly three women.\n\nLet me calculate each scenario separately and then add them up.\n\nScenario 1: One woman and two men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one woman from five: C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nNumber of ways to choose two men from eight: C(8, 2) = (8 \u00d7 7) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 28.\n\nSo, total for this scenario: 5 \u00d7 28 = 140.\n\nScenario 2: Two women and one man.\n\nNumber of ways to choose two women from five: C(5, 2) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 10.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one man from eight: C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nSo, total for this scenario: 10 \u00d7 8 = 80.\n\nScenario 3: Three women.\n\nNumber of ways to choose three women from five: C(5, 3) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 10.\n\nNow, add up all the scenarios: 140 + 80 + 10 = 230.\n\nOkay, that matches the previous result. So, 230 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered that \"at least one woman\" means the complement of \"no women,\" which is the same as \"all men.\" So, total committees minus all-men committees gives the same 286 - 56 = 230.\n\nEither way, I end up with 230.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst method:\n\nTotal committees: C(13, 3) = 286.\n\nAll-men committees: C(8, 3) = 56.\n\nDifference: 286 - 56 = 230.\n\nSecond method:\n\nScenario 1: C(5, 1) \u00d7 C(8, 2) = 5 \u00d7 28 = 140.\n\nScenario 2: C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(8, 1) = 10 \u00d7 8 = 80.\n\nScenario 3: C(5, 3) = 10.\n\nSum: 140 + 80 + 10 = 230.\n\nBoth methods confirm the same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 230 ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{230} \\]"
