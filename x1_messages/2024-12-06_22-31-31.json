The user is asking about the weather in a specific location (New York) on a specific day (tomorrow). So, the key elements here are:\n\n- Location: New York\n\n- Date: Tomorrow\n\nLooking at the available functions:\n\n1. **csv_analytics**: This function is for performing operations like counts, aggregations, etc., on CSV data. It doesn't seem relevant to the user's query about weather.\n\n2. **weather_forecast**: This function is specifically designed to provide weather forecasts for specified places on specified dates. It has parameters for location and date, which match exactly with the user's query.\n\n3. **search_engine**: This function helps users locate information by transforming their queries into search terms and filters. While it could be used to find information about the weather, it's more general and not as directly applicable as the weather_forecast function.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate function to use is **weather_forecast**.\n\nNow, I need to set the parameters for this function based on the user's query.\n\nThe parameters for **weather_forecast** are:\n\n- location: Name of the city for which the forecast is required.\n\n- date: Date for which the forecast is required.\n\nFrom the user's query:\n\n- Location: New York\n\n- Date: Tomorrow\n\nSo, I need to set:\n\n- location: \"New York\"\n\n- date: \"tomorrow\"\n\nHowever, I should consider that \"tomorrow\" is a relative term and needs to be converted into a specific date. For example, if today is October 10, 2023, tomorrow would be October 11, 2023. But since I don't have real-time date capabilities, I'll assume that the function can interpret \"tomorrow\" accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the function call should look like:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: weather_forecast\nparameters:\n  location: \"New York\"\n  date: \"tomorrow\"\n```\n\nBut to make it more precise, especially if the function requires a specific date format, I might need to provide the date in a standard format like YYYY-MM-DD. However, since the function accepts \"date\" as a parameter and \"tomorrow\" is a common relative term, I'll keep it as \"tomorrow\".\n\nHence, the final response in YAML format is:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: weather_forecast\nparameters:\n  location: \"New York\"\n  date: \"tomorrow\"\n```\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate function to use based on the user's query and set its parameters accordingly. \\]\n\n\\[ **Step 1: Analyze the User's Query** \\]\n\n\\[ The user asks: \"What will be the weather in New York tomorrow?\" This indicates that they are seeking a weather forecast for a specific location and date. \\]\n\n\\[ **Step 2: Review Available Functions** \\]\n\n\\[ We have three functions available: \\]\n\n\\[ 1. **csv_analytics**: Useful for operations like counts and aggregations on CSV data. \\]\n\n\\[ 2. **weather_forecast**: Provides weather forecasts for specified locations and dates. \\]\n\n\\[ 3. **search_engine**: Helps in locating information by transforming queries into search terms and filters. \\]\n\n\\[ **Step 3: Select the Most Appropriate Function** \\]\n\n\\[ Given the user's query is about weather, the most suitable function is **weather_forecast** because it directly provides weather information based on location and date. \\]\n\n\\[ **Step 4: Map User Query to Function Parameters** \\]\n\n\\[ The **weather_forecast** function requires two parameters: \\]\n\n\\[ - **location**: The city for which the forecast is needed. \\]\n\n\\[ - **date**: The date for which the forecast is required. \\]\n\n\\[ From the user's query: \\]\n\n\\[ - Location: New York \\]\n\n\\[ - Date: Tomorrow \\]\n\n\\[ **Step 5: Consider Date Interpretation** \\]\n\n\\[ \"Tomorrow\" is a relative term and should be interpreted as the day following the current date. Although the function might handle \"tomorrow\" directly, it's essential to ensure the date is correctly represented. \\]\n\n\\[ **Step 6: Construct the Function Call in YAML Format** \\]\n\n\\[ Based on the above, the function call should be structured as follows: \\]\n\n\\[ ```yaml \\]\n\n\\[ function: weather_forecast \\]\n\n\\[ parameters: \\]\n\n\\[ location: \"New York\" \\]\n\n\\[ date: \"tomorrow\" \\]\n\n\\[ ``` \\]\n\n\\[ **Final Answer** \\]\n\n\\[ ```yaml \\]\n\n\\[ function: weather_forecast \\]\n\n\\[ parameters: \\]\n\n\\[ location: \"New York\" \\]\n\n\\[ date: \"tomorrow\" \\]\n\n\\[ ``` \\]"
