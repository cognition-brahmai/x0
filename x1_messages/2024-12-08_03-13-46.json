        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a bag with 4 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 5 green marbles. That's a total of 4 + 6 + 5 = 15 marbles. We're supposed to draw three marbles at random without replacement, and we want to find the probability that we get one marble of each color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw three marbles out of 15 without regard to order. Since the order doesn't matter, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 15 is:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15!}{3!(15 - 3)!} = \\frac{15!}{3! \\times 12!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the 12! in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!}{3! \\times 12!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 3! is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6, so:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n15 \u00d7 14 = 210\n\n210 \u00d7 13 = 2730\n\n2730 \u00f7 6 = 455\n\nSo, there are 455 possible ways to draw 3 marbles out of 15.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw one marble of each color. There are three colors: red, blue, and green. So, we need one red, one blue, and one green marble.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red marble out of four is:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 1) = \\frac{4!}{1!(4 - 1)!} = \\frac{4!}{1! \\times 3!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3!}{1 \\times 3!} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one blue marble out of six is:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 1) = \\frac{6!}{1!(6 - 1)!} = \\frac{6!}{1! \\times 5!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5!}{1 \\times 5!} = 6\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one green marble out of five is:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 1) = \\frac{5!}{1!(5 - 1)!} = \\frac{5!}{1! \\times 4!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4!}{1 \\times 4!} = 5\n\\]\n\nSince these choices are independent, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to draw one marble of each color.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{120}{455}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\div 5}{455 \\div 5} = \\frac{24}{91}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing one marble of each color is \\( \\frac{24}{91} \\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I recall that sometimes in probability problems involving multiple stages, the order in which we draw the marbles might matter, but in this case, since we're drawing without replacement and not considering order, the approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the probability of drawing one of each color in a specific order, and then account for all possible orders.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing a red first, then a blue, then a green would be:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{red first}) = \\frac{4}{15}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that a red has been drawn, there are now 14 marbles left:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{blue second}) = \\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{3}{7}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that a red and a blue have been drawn, there are 13 marbles left:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{green third}) = \\frac{5}{13}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (red, then blue, then green) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{15} \\times \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{13} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 5}{15 \\times 7 \\times 13} = \\frac{60}{1365}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{1365} = \\frac{4}{91}\n\\]\n\nBut this is just for one specific order. Since there are 3! = 6 possible orders in which we can draw one of each color (RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BGR, BRG), we need to multiply this probability by 6:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\frac{4}{91} = \\frac{24}{91}\n\\]\n\nSo, this matches the earlier result of \\( \\frac{24}{91} \\).\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf we consider the order of drawing the marbles, the total number of ways to draw three marbles out of 15 is:\n\n\\[\nP(15, 3) = \\frac{15!}{(15 - 3)!} = 15 \\times 14 \\times 13\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of favorable outcomes would be the number of ways to arrange one red, one blue, and one green marble in order, which is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 3! = 4 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 720\n\\]\n\nWait, no. Actually, if we're considering order, the number of favorable outcomes is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ choices for red} \\times 6 \\text{ choices for blue} \\times 5 \\text{ choices for green} = 4 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 120\n\\]\n\nBut since the order matters, we don't multiply by 3!. So, the probability would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{15 \\times 14 \\times 13} = \\frac{120}{2730} = \\frac{24}{546} = \\frac{12}{273} = \\frac{4}{91}\n\\]\n\nWait, this is the same as the probability for one specific order earlier. So, to get the total probability for any order, we need to multiply by the number of possible orders, which is 3! = 6:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\frac{4}{91} = \\frac{24}{91}\n\\]\n\nSo, again, we get \\( \\frac{24}{91} \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of hypergeometric distribution, since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (total marbles: 15)\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (for example, red marbles: 4)\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (3)\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (for example, 1 red marble)\n\nBut since we want one of each color, we need to adjust this formula accordingly.\n\nActually, in this case, it might be more straightforward to stick with the initial approach using combinations.\n\nSo, to summarize: total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 15 is 455, and the number of ways to choose one of each color is 120, leading to a probability of \\( \\frac{120}{455} = \\frac{24}{91} \\).\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{91}} \\]"
