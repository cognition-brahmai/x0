She's been in a lot of romantic comedies and she was born in the 1960s, but another one is Jennifer Lopez, who's also known for rom-coms and was born in the 1960s as well. But since you specified the 1970s, maybe it's someone else. Let me think... Is it Jennifer Garner? She was born in 1972 and has been in some romantic comedies like \"13 Going on 30.\" Or perhaps Jennifer Connelly, but she's more known for dramas. Hmm, I'm not sure. Can you give me another hint?"
