        "content": "So the train is going at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 30 minutes to get from Station A to Station B. I need to find out how far apart these two stations are.\n\nFirst, I should remember the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, if the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 30 minutes, I can plug these values into the formula. But wait, the time is in minutes, and the speed is in miles per hour. I need to make sure that the units are compatible.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, I can convert 30 minutes to hours:\n\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, I can plug the values into the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSo, Station A and Station B are 30 miles apart.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using proportions or something else. Let's see.\n\nIf the train travels 60 miles in one hour, then in half an hour, it would travel half of that distance, which is 30 miles. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the speed in miles per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 miles per hour is equivalent to 1 mile per minute.\n\nSo, at 1 mile per minute, in 30 minutes, the train would travel 30 miles.\n\nThat's another way to look at it, and it confirms the same answer.\n\nIs there any other approach I can take to verify this?\n\nPerhaps using the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}} \\]\n\nI can rearrange this formula to solve for distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{total distance} = \\text{average speed} \\times \\text{total time} \\]\n\nAgain, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{total distance} = 60 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSame result again.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like acceleration or something. But the problem says it's traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, so I think it's safe to assume that it's moving at a constant speed, and I don't need to worry about acceleration.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correctly handled. I converted minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. If I had the speed in a different unit, like miles per minute, I would need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use dimensional analysis to ensure that the units cancel out appropriately.\n\nSo, 60 miles per hour times 30 minutes:\n\nFirst, write out the units:\n\n\\[ 60 \\, \\frac{\\text{miles}}{\\text{hour}} \\times 30 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nI need to convert minutes to hours to cancel out the hour in the denominator.\n\nSince 1 hour = 60 minutes, I can write 30 minutes as:\n\n\\[ 30 \\, \\text{minutes} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{hour}}{60 \\, \\text{minutes}} = 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nNow, plugging back in:\n\n\\[ 60 \\, \\frac{\\text{miles}}{\\text{hour}} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 30 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nThe hours unit cancels out, leaving miles, which is what I want.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 30 miles.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if the time was in seconds or another unit. But in this case, it's clearly 30 minutes, which is half an hour, and the calculations hold.\n\nSo, Station A and Station B are 30 miles apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
