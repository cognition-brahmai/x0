        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of candies: one costs $0.25 each, and the other costs $0.50 each. Someone bought a total of 20 candies and spent exactly $7.50. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, let's assign some variables to make things easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of $0.25 candies.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of $0.50 candies.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candies is 20.\n\n2. The total cost is $7.50.\n\nWe can translate these into equations.\n\nFrom the first piece of information:\n\n\\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\nFrom the second piece of information:\n\n\\( 0.25x + 0.50y = 7.50 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nLet's look at the first equation:\n\n\\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\nWe can solve for one variable in terms of the other. How about solving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 0.25(20 - y) + 0.50y = 7.50 \\)\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.25 by 20:\n\n\\( 0.25 \\times 20 = 5 \\)\n\nThen, multiply 0.25 by \\( -y \\):\n\n\\( 0.25 \\times (-y) = -0.25y \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( 5 - 0.25y + 0.50y = 7.50 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\( 5 + (-0.25y + 0.50y) = 7.50 \\)\n\n\\( -0.25y + 0.50y = 0.25y \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\( 5 + 0.25y = 7.50 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.25y = 2.50 \\)\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.25:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nNow that we have \\( y \\), we can find \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - y = 20 - 10 = 10 \\)\n\nSo, the person bought 10 candies of the $0.25 type and 10 candies of the $0.50 type.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it's correct.\n\nTotal candies: \\( 10 + 10 = 20 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal cost: \\( 10 \\times 0.25 + 10 \\times 0.50 = 2.50 + 5.00 = 7.50 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, the answer is 10 candies of each type.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ candies of each type}} \\]"
