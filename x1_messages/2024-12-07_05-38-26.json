        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Prim's algorithm is a popular method for generating random mazes because it's efficient and guarantees a perfect maze with no loops. We'll create a Python script that generates a maze using Prim's algorithm and then visualizes it using ASCII characters.\n\nFirst, let's understand how Prim's algorithm works in the context of maze generation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a grid where all cells are considered \"walls.\" Choose a starting cell and mark it as \"visited.\"\n\n2. **Frontier Management**: Maintain a list of \"frontier\" cells, which are the unvisited neighbors of the visited cells.\n\n3. **Iteration**:\n   - Randomly select a cell from the frontier.\n   - Choose a visited neighbor of this cell and remove the wall between them.\n   - Mark the selected cell as visited and add its unvisited neighbors to the frontier.\n\n4. **Termination**: Continue this process until there are no cells left in the frontier.\n\nOnce the maze is generated, we'll represent it using ASCII characters. For example, walls can be represented by '#' and paths by ' ' (space).\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Grid\n\nWe'll represent the maze as a 2D grid where each cell can be either a wall ('#') or a path (' ').\n\n### Step 2: Implement Prim's Algorithm\n\nWe'll need to keep track of visited cells and the frontier cells. We'll use a list to store the frontier and a set for visited cells for quick lookups.\n\n### Step 3: Visualization\n\nAfter generating the maze, we'll print the grid using ASCII characters.\n\n### Final Solution\n\nHere's the complete Python script that generates a random maze using Prim's algorithm and visualizes it using ASCII characters:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_maze(width, height):\n    # Initialize the grid with walls\n    maze = [['#'] * width for _ in range(height)]\n    \n    # Define possible directions\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Choose a starting cell\n    start_x = random.randrange(1, width, 2)\n    start_y = random.randrange(1, height, 2)\n    maze[start_y][start_x] = ' '\n    \n    # Set of visited cells\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((start_y, start_x))\n    \n    # List of frontier cells\n    frontier = []\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = start_x + dx * 2, start_y + dy * 2\n        if 0 < nx < width and 0 < ny < height:\n            frontier.append((ny, nx))\n            maze[ny][nx] = ' '\n    \n    while frontier:\n        # Randomly select a cell from the frontier\n        fx, fy = random.choice(frontier)\n        frontier.remove((fx, fy))\n        \n        # Find visited neighbors\n        neighbors = []\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = fy + dx * 2, fx + dy * 2\n            if (ny, nx) in visited:\n                neighbors.append((ny, nx))\n        \n        if neighbors:\n            # Choose a random visited neighbor\n            vy, vx = random.choice(neighbors)\n            \n            # Remove the wall between current cell and visited neighbor\n            maze[fx][fy] = ' '\n            maze[(fx + vy) // 2][(fy + vx) // 2] = ' '\n            \n            # Mark current cell as visited\n            visited.add((fx, fy))\n            \n            # Add unvisited neighbors to the frontier\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = fy + dx * 2, fx + dy * 2\n                if 0 < nx < width and 0 < ny < height and (ny, nx) not in visited and (ny, nx) not in frontier:\n                    frontier.append((ny, nx))\n                    maze[ny][nx] = ' '\n    \n    return maze\n\ndef print_maze(maze):\n    for row in maze:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    width = 21  # Must be odd for the maze to work properly\n    height = 21 # Must be odd for the maze to work properly\n    maze = generate_maze(width, height)\n    print_maze(maze)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Grid Initialization**: We start with a grid filled with walls ('#'). The width and height should be odd numbers to ensure the maze paths align correctly.\n\n2. **Starting Cell**: A random starting cell is chosen, and it's marked as a path (' ').\n\n3. **Frontier Management**: The frontier list keeps track of cells that are one step away from visited cells. These cells are potential candidates for expansion.\n\n4. **Maze Generation**:\n   - Randomly select a cell from the frontier.\n   - Connect it to a random visited neighbor by removing the wall between them.\n   - Mark this cell as visited and add its unvisited neighbors to the frontier.\n\n5. **Visualization**: The maze is printed row by row, displaying walls as '#' and paths as spaces.\n\nThis script will generate a random maze every time it's run, providing a new challenge each time."
