        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that in a certain city, the probability of rain on any given day is 30%. And I need to find out the probability that it will rain on exactly 3 out of 5 consecutive days. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that probability can be a bit tricky, but I think this might involve something called the binomial probability formula. I seem to remember that from stats class. The binomial formula is used when there are exactly two mutually exclusive outcomes of a trial, like rain or no rain in this case.\n\nSo, the binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C(n,k) \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (days in this case),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (days it rains),\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on an individual trial (probability it rains on any given day),\n\n- \\( C(n,k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time,\n\n- \\( (1-p) \\) is the probability of failure on an individual trial (probability it does not rain).\n\nGiven that, in this problem:\n\n- \\( n = 5 \\) (five consecutive days),\n\n- \\( k = 3 \\) (we want it to rain on exactly three days),\n\n- \\( p = 0.30 \\) (30% chance of rain on any given day),\n\n- Therefore, \\( (1-p) = 0.70 \\) (70% chance it does not rain on any given day).\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( C(5,3) \\), which is the number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 for it to rain. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ C(5,3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 \\]\n\nSo, there are 10 different ways for it to rain on exactly 3 out of 5 days.\n\nNext, I need to calculate \\( p^k \\), which is \\( (0.30)^3 \\):\n\n\\[ (0.30)^3 = 0.027 \\]\n\nThen, \\( (1-p)^{n-k} \\), which is \\( (0.70)^{2} \\):\n\n\\[ (0.70)^2 = 0.49 \\]\n\nNow, putting it all together in the binomial formula:\n\n\\[ P(3) = 10 \\times 0.027 \\times 0.49 \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 10 by 0.027:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.027 = 0.27 \\]\n\nThen, multiply that by 0.49:\n\n\\[ 0.27 \\times 0.49 = 0.1323 \\]\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 3 out of 5 consecutive days is 0.1323, or 13.23%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- \\( C(5,3) = 10 \\), that seems correct.\n\n- \\( (0.30)^3 = 0.027 \\), that's right.\n\n- \\( (0.70)^2 = 0.49 \\), correct.\n\n- Multiplying them together: \\( 10 \\times 0.027 = 0.27 \\), and \\( 0.27 \\times 0.49 = 0.1323 \\), which is 13.23%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach to verify this result. Perhaps using the binomial probability formula again, but being extra careful with the calculations.\n\nLet me calculate \\( C(5,3) \\) again:\n\n\\[ C(5,3) = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = 10 \\]\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, \\( p^k = (0.3)^3 = 0.027 \\)\n\nAnd \\( (1-p)^{n-k} = (0.7)^2 = 0.49 \\)\n\nMultiplying them: \\( 10 \\times 0.027 \\times 0.49 = 0.1323 \\)\n\nStill the same answer. Okay, maybe I can try calculating it using a different formula or method.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the probability of a specific sequence of rain and no rain, and then multiply by the number of such sequences.\n\nFor example, the probability of rain on the first three days and no rain on the last two would be:\n\n\\[ (0.3)^3 \\times (0.7)^2 = 0.027 \\times 0.49 = 0.01323 \\]\n\nBut that's just one specific sequence. Since there are \\( C(5,3) = 10 \\) such sequences, multiplying by 10 gives:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.01323 = 0.1323 \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the binomial probability formula in a calculator or look up a binomial probability table, but since I don't have that right now, I'll trust my calculations.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says \"exactly 3 out of 5 consecutive days,\" so it's not asking for at least 3 or less than 3, but precisely 3 days of rain.\n\nAlso, it's assuming that the probability of rain on any given day is independent of the other days, which is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nGiven that, my approach using the binomial formula seems appropriate.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 0.1323, or 13.23%.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, is there any possibility of dependency between days that I haven't accounted for? The problem states that the probability is 30% on any given day, suggesting independence.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the days are truly consecutive, but in terms of probability calculations for independent events, consecutiveness doesn't affect the calculation as long as the probabilities remain independent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 13.23% is the correct probability that it will rain on exactly 3 out of 5 consecutive days in this city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.1323} \\]"
