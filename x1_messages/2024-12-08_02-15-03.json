He was a leading figure in the Impressionist movement and is renowned for his series of paintings like \"Water Lilies\" and \"Haystacks.\" Later in his life, Monet did indeed suffer from cataracts, which significantly impacted his vision and, consequently, his color perception. This condition influenced the way he saw colors and, in turn, how he painted them. It's fascinating to see how his work evolved during this period, reflecting the changes in his visual experience."
