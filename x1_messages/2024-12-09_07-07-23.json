        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a tank with a mixture of water and alcohol in the ratio of 3:5. That means for every 3 parts of water, there are 5 parts of alcohol. The total parts in the mixture are 3 + 5 = 8 parts.\n\nLet's denote the initial volume of the tank as V gallons. So, the amount of water initially in the tank is (3/8)V gallons, and the amount of alcohol is (5/8)V gallons.\n\nNow, the problem states that 10 gallons of this mixture are removed and replaced with pure water. When we remove 10 gallons of the mixture, we're removing both water and alcohol in the same 3:5 ratio.\n\nSo, the amount of water removed is (3/8)*10 gallons, and the amount of alcohol removed is (5/8)*10 gallons.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nWater removed = (3/8)*10 = 30/8 = 3.75 gallons\n\nAlcohol removed = (5/8)*10 = 50/8 = 6.25 gallons\n\nAfter removing 10 gallons of the mixture, the remaining amounts in the tank are:\n\nRemaining water = initial water - water removed = (3/8)V - 3.75 gallons\n\nRemaining alcohol = initial alcohol - alcohol removed = (5/8)V - 6.25 gallons\n\nThen, we add back 10 gallons of pure water. So, the new amount of water in the tank is:\n\nNew water = remaining water + 10 = (3/8)V - 3.75 + 10 = (3/8)V + 6.25 gallons\n\nThe amount of alcohol remains the same since we're only adding water:\n\nNew alcohol = remaining alcohol = (5/8)V - 6.25 gallons\n\nAccording to the problem, the new ratio of water to alcohol is 1:1. That means the amounts of water and alcohol are equal.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(3/8)V + 6.25 = (5/8)V - 6.25\n\nNow, let's solve for V.\n\nFirst, subtract (3/8)V from both sides:\n\n6.25 = (5/8)V - (3/8)V - 6.25\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n6.25 = (2/8)V - 6.25\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n6.25 = (1/4)V - 6.25\n\nNow, add 6.25 to both sides:\n\n6.25 + 6.25 = (1/4)V\n\n12.5 = (1/4)V\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 4 to solve for V:\n\nV = 12.5 * 4\n\nV = 50 gallons\n\nSo, the initial volume of the tank was 50 gallons.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nInitial volume: 50 gallons\n\nInitial water: (3/8)*50 = 18.75 gallons\n\nInitial alcohol: (5/8)*50 = 31.25 gallons\n\nRemove 10 gallons of mixture:\n\nWater removed: (3/8)*10 = 3.75 gallons\n\nAlcohol removed: (5/8)*10 = 6.25 gallons\n\nRemaining water: 18.75 - 3.75 = 15 gallons\n\nRemaining alcohol: 31.25 - 6.25 = 25 gallons\n\nAdd back 10 gallons of pure water:\n\nNew water: 15 + 10 = 25 gallons\n\nNew alcohol: 25 gallons\n\nNew ratio: 25:25 = 1:1, which matches the problem statement.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
