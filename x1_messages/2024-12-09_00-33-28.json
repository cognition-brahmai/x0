        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular room with an area of 200 square meters, and it's given that the length is twice its width. We need to find the dimensions, which means finding both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area = length \u00d7 width.\n\nNow, it's given that the length is twice the width. That means if we let the width be some value, say W meters, then the length would be 2 times W, or 2W meters.\n\nSo, plugging these into the area formula, we get:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\n200 = 2W \u00d7 W\n\nSo, 200 = 2W\u00b2\n\nNow, to find W, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n200 \u00f7 2 = 2W\u00b2 \u00f7 2\n\n100 = W\u00b2\n\nThen, to solve for W, we take the square root of both sides:\n\n\u221a100 = \u221aW\u00b2\n\n10 = W\n\nSo, the width is 10 meters.\n\nNow, since the length is twice the width, length = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20 meters.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the room are 20 meters in length and 10 meters in width.\n\nWait a minute, let me just double-check that. If width is 10 meters and length is 20 meters, then the area would be 10 \u00d7 20 = 200 square meters, which matches the given area. Also, the length is indeed twice the width, since 20 is twice 10. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{length} = 20 \\text{ meters}, \\text{ width} = 10 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
