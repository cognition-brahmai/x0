        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a store sells two types of toys, cars and dolls, and the ratio of cars to dolls is 5:7. There are a total of 48 toys. I need to figure out how many cars and dolls there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio is. A ratio is a comparison of two quantities. Here, for every 5 cars, there are 7 dolls. So, the ratio 5:7 means that for every 5 parts that are cars, there are 7 parts that are dolls.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars and dolls there are in total, I need to figure out what each part of the ratio represents in terms of actual toys.\n\nLet's denote the number of cars as 5x and the number of dolls as 7x, where x is a common multiplier. This way, the ratio remains 5:7.\n\nSo, cars = 5x\n\nDolls = 7x\n\nAnd the total number of toys is 48.\n\nTherefore, cars plus dolls equals 48:\n\n5x + 7x = 48\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n12x = 48\n\nNow, I need to solve for x:\n\nx = 48 / 12\n\nx = 4\n\nNow that I have x, I can find the number of cars and dolls.\n\nCars = 5x = 5 * 4 = 20\n\nDolls = 7x = 7 * 4 = 28\n\nSo, there are 20 cars and 28 dolls.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that.\n\nTotal toys: 20 + 28 = 48, which matches the total given.\n\nAnd the ratio: 20:28 simplifies to 5:7, since both 20 and 28 can be divided by 4.\n\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\n28 \u00f7 4 = 7\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this by considering the parts of the ratio.\n\nThe ratio is 5:7, so there are 5 parts cars and 7 parts dolls, making a total of 12 parts.\n\nIf 12 parts represent 48 toys, then each part represents 48 / 12 = 4 toys.\n\nTherefore, cars: 5 parts * 4 toys/part = 20 toys\n\nDolls: 7 parts * 4 toys/part = 28 toys\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20 \\text{ cars and } 28 \\text{ dolls}} \\]"
