First, I need to find out the average water usage per household per day based on the number of people living in it and their individual water usage.\n\nSo, I know that each person uses about 80-100 gallons of water per day. That's a range, so maybe I should calculate both the lower and upper end to get an idea of the possible usage.\n\nAlso, the average number of people per household is 2.53. That's interesting because it's not a whole number, which makes sense since households can vary in size.\n\nSo, to find the total water usage per household per day, I need to multiply the average water usage per person per day by the average number of people per household.\n\nFirst, let's consider the lower end of the range: 80 gallons per person per day.\n\nTotal water usage per household per day (lower end) = 80 gallons/person/day * 2.53 persons/household\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n80 * 2.53 = 80 * 2 + 80 * 0.5 + 80 * 0.03\n\n= 160 + 40 + 2.4\n\n= 202.4 gallons/household/day\n\nNow, for the upper end: 100 gallons per person per day.\n\nTotal water usage per household per day (upper end) = 100 gallons/person/day * 2.53 persons/household\n\n= 100 * 2.53\n\n= 253 gallons/household/day\n\nSo, the average American household uses between 202.4 and 253 gallons of water per day.\n\nBut, I think it would also be useful to find the exact average within that range. Since the individual usage is between 80-100 gallons, the average per person would be (80 + 100)/2 = 90 gallons/person/day.\n\nSo, using the average individual usage:\n\nTotal water usage per household per day (average) = 90 gallons/person/day * 2.53 persons/household\n\n= 90 * 2.53\n\n= 90 * 2 + 90 * 0.5 + 90 * 0.03\n\n= 180 + 45 + 2.7\n\n= 227.7 gallons/household/day\n\nTherefore, on average, an American household uses about 227.7 gallons of water per day.\n\nBut, to make sure, let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since the range is 80-100 gallons per person, and there are 2.53 people per household, the total usage per household would range from 202.4 to 253 gallons per day, as I calculated earlier.\n\nUsing the average of that range:\n\n(202.4 + 253)/2 = 455.4 / 2 = 227.7 gallons/household/day\n\nWhich matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, is the average number of people per household really 2.53? I recall that this figure can vary based on different sources and over time.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average number of people per household has been around 2.5 to 2.6 in recent years.\n\nSo, 2.53 seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, the water usage per person can vary based on\u5730\u533a, climate, and household habits.\n\nBut, since the question provides the range of 80-100 gallons per person per day, I'll stick with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that some households might have more efficient water usage due to low-flow fixtures or water-saving practices, which could bring the usage down.\n\nConversely, households with swimming pools or extensive landscaping might use more water.\n\nHowever, since the question provides a general range, I'll assume it's accounting for these variations to some extent.\n\nSo, in conclusion, based on the given data, the average American household uses approximately 227.7 gallons of water per day.\n\nBut, since the question provides a range for individual usage, it's probably more accurate to present the range:\n\nBetween 202.4 and 253 gallons per day per household.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to present it with the average individual usage, 227.7 gallons per day per household.\n\nI think it's useful to provide both the range and the average for a better understanding.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Lower end: 202.4 gallons/household/day\n\n- Average: 227.7 gallons/household/day\n\n- Upper end: 253 gallons/household/day\n\nThis gives a clear picture of the potential water usage by American households.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider or calculate?\n\nI think this should suffice for the given question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{227.7 \\text{ gallons/household/day}} \\]"
