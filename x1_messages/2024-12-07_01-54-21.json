        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: A car travels at an average speed of 45 miles per hour for 3 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find out how far the car travels. Okay, so I know that distance is related to speed and time, right? I think the formula is distance equals speed multiplied by time, or d = s * t. So, if the speed is 45 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours and 30 minutes, I just need to plug in these values into the formula.\n\nBut wait, the time is given in hours and minutes. I need to convert that into hours because the speed is in miles per hour. So, 3 hours and 30 minutes. I know that 30 minutes is half an hour, so 3 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 3.5 hours. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula: d = 45 miles per hour * 3.5 hours. Hmm, let me calculate that. 45 multiplied by 3 is 135, and 45 multiplied by 0.5 is 22.5. So, 135 plus 22.5 should give me 157.5 miles.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another way to do this to confirm. Maybe I can convert everything into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 miles per hour is how many miles per minute? Let's see, 45 miles per 60 minutes, which is 0.75 miles per minute.\n\nNow, 3 hours and 30 minutes is 3*60 + 30, which is 180 + 30, equal to 210 minutes.\n\nSo, distance equals 0.75 miles per minute times 210 minutes, which is 0.75 * 210. Let's calculate that: 0.75 times 200 is 150, and 0.75 times 10 is 7.5, so total is 157.5 miles again. Okay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe using the concept of proportion. If the car travels 45 miles in one hour, then in 3.5 hours, it should travel 3.5 times 45 miles. So, again, 3.5 * 45.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 45 is 135, and 0.5 * 45 is 22.5, total 157.5 miles. So, consistent results.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that speed is sometimes given in kilometers per hour, and we need to convert units. But in this case, it's miles per hour, and the question is in the same units, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the time is correctly converted to hours. 3 hours and 30 minutes is indeed 3.5 hours. Alternatively, 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, so 3 + 0.5 is 3.5 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 30 minutes is half an hour, so traveling for half an hour at 45 miles per hour would cover half of 45 miles, which is 22.5 miles, and for 3 hours, it's 3 * 45 = 135 miles. So, total distance is 135 + 22.5 = 157.5 miles.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now. So, the car travels 157.5 miles.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation, like acceleration or something. The problem says the car travels at an average speed of 45 miles per hour, so I think using the average speed in the formula is appropriate. It doesn't mention any changes in speed, so we can assume constant speed for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the time is exact or if there's any need to account for stopping time or breaks, but the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I don't think it's necessary.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the car travels 157.5 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{157.5 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
