        "content": "Let's see. So, Tom has twice as many apples as Mary, and together they have 18 apples. I need to find out how many apples Tom has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the number of apples each person has. Let's say Mary has M apples. Since Tom has twice as many as Mary, Tom would have 2M apples.\n\nNow, together they have 18 apples, so Mary's apples plus Tom's apples equals 18. That would be M + 2M = 18.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 3M = 18.\n\nTo find M, I can divide both sides by 3: M = 18 / 3 = 6.\n\nSo, Mary has 6 apples. Since Tom has twice as many, Tom has 2 * 6 = 12 apples.\n\nLet me check that: 6 (Mary's apples) + 12 (Tom's apples) = 18. That matches the total given.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using ratios or something else.\n\nWell, since Tom has twice as many apples as Mary, the ratio of Tom's apples to Mary's apples is 2:1.\n\nThat means for every 2 apples Tom has, Mary has 1 apple. Together, that's 3 parts, and the total is 18 apples.\n\nSo, each part is 18 / 3 = 6 apples.\n\nTherefore, Tom has 2 parts, which is 2 * 6 = 12 apples.\n\nMary has 1 part, which is 6 apples.\n\nSame answer as before. Seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have set up an equation using Tom's apples as T and Mary's as M, with T = 2M and T + M = 18.\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second: 2M + M = 18, which again gives 3M = 18, so M = 6, and T = 12.\n\nRegardless of the method, the answer is the same. Tom has 12 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
