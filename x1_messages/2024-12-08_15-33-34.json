        "content": "Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 3x + 4 = 16. I need to find out what x is. Let me think about how to do this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the goal is to isolate x, which means I need to get x alone on one side of the equation. The equation right now is 3x + 4 = 16. So, there's something being added to 3x, which is 4. Maybe I should start by getting rid of the 4 so that only terms with x are left on one side.\n\nTo do that, I can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation. That way, the equation stays balanced. So, if I subtract 4 from both sides, it looks like this:\n\n3x + 4 - 4 = 16 - 4\n\nOn the left side, +4 and -4 cancel each other out, so I'm left with:\n\n3x = 12\n\nNow, I have 3x = 12. That means 3 multiplied by x equals 12. To find x, I need to do the opposite of multiplication, which is division. So, I should divide both sides by 3 to isolate x.\n\nLet's do that:\n\n3x / 3 = 12 / 3\n\nOn the left side, 3 divided by 3 is 1, so it's just x:\n\nx = 4\n\nOkay, so x equals 4. But I should check if this is correct. Maybe I can plug x back into the original equation to see if it works.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 4 = 16\n\nPlugging in x = 4:\n\n3*(4) + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16\n\nYes, it checks out. So, x = 4 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
