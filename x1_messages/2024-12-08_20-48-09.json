        "content": "To implement a Python script that extracts email addresses from a given text file using regular expressions, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Read the Text File:** We need to read the content of the text file into a string so that we can process it.\n\n2. **Define the Regular Expression Pattern for Emails:** Email addresses have a specific format, and we can use a regular expression (regex) pattern to match them.\n\n3. **Use the `re` Module to Find All Matches:** Python's `re` module provides functions to work with regular expressions. We'll use `re.findall()` to find all occurrences of the email pattern in the text.\n\n4. **Handle the Results:** Once we have the list of email addresses, we can print them, save them to another file, or perform any other desired operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_emails(file_path):\n    # Define the regex pattern for email addresses\n    email_pattern = r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'\n    \n    # Read the content of the file\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        content = file.read()\n    \n    # Find all matches using the email pattern\n    emails = re.findall(email_pattern, content)\n    \n    return emails\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Specify the path to your text file\n    file_path = 'path_to_your_text_file.txt'\n    \n    # Extract emails from the file\n    extracted_emails = extract_emails(file_path)\n    \n    # Print the extracted emails\n    for email in extracted_emails:\n        print(email)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the Text File:**\n   - We use the `open()` function to open the file in read mode and `read()` to read its content into a string.\n\n2. **Defining the Regular Expression Pattern:**\n   - The pattern `r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'` is designed to match most common email addresses.\n   - Breakdown:\n     - `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches the local part of the email before the '@' symbol.\n     - `@`: Matches the '@' symbol.\n     - `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches the domain name.\n     - `\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`: Matches the top-level domain (TLD), ensuring it has at least two alphabetic characters.\n\n3. **Using `re.findall()`:**\n   - This function returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.\n\n4. **Handling the Results:**\n   - We simply print each extracted email address. Depending on the requirements, you could modify this part to write the emails to another file or perform other operations.\n\n### Notes\n\n- **File Path:** Make sure to provide the correct path to your text file in the `file_path` variable.\n- **Regex Pattern:** While the provided pattern covers many common email formats, it might not catch all possible valid emails due to the complexity and variability in email address structures. For more comprehensive email validation, consider using more intricate patterns or dedicated email validation libraries.\n- **Error Handling:** For robustness, you might want to add error handling to manage cases where the file does not exist or cannot be read."
