        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the store sells apples in bags of 4 and oranges in bags of 5. I need to buy an equal number of apples and oranges, and I want to find out the minimum number of each fruit I must purchase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to buy an equal number of apples and oranges. That means the total number of apples should be the same as the total number of oranges.\n\nNow, apples come in bags of 4, so if I buy one bag, I get 4 apples. If I buy two bags, I get 8 apples, and so on. Similarly, oranges come in bags of 5, so one bag gives me 5 oranges, two bags give me 10, and so forth.\n\nSo, the total number of apples is a multiple of 4, and the total number of oranges is a multiple of 5. I need these two quantities to be equal.\n\nThis sounds like I need to find a common multiple of 4 and 5. Specifically, the smallest such multiple, since I'm looking for the minimum number.\n\nWait, I remember that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So, maybe I need to find the LCM of 4 and 5.\n\nLet me recall how to find the LCM of two numbers. One way is to list the multiples of each number until I find the smallest one they have in common.\n\nMultiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, ...\n\nMultiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, ...\n\nLooking at these, the first common multiple is 20. So, the LCM of 4 and 5 is 20.\n\nDoes that mean the minimum number of each fruit I need to buy is 20?\n\nWait a minute, let's think about that. If I buy 20 apples and 20 oranges, that would be equal, but I need to consider how they are packed.\n\nApples are in bags of 4, so 20 apples would require 20 divided by 4, which is 5 bags.\n\nOranges are in bags of 5, so 20 oranges would require 20 divided by 5, which is 4 bags.\n\nSo, to have 20 apples and 20 oranges, I need to buy 5 bags of apples and 4 bags of oranges.\n\nBut is there a smaller number than 20 where the number of apples equals the number of oranges?\n\nLet me check. Suppose I buy fewer bags.\n\nIf I buy 1 bag of apples (4 apples) and 1 bag of oranges (5 oranges), that's not equal.\n\nIf I buy 2 bags of apples (8 apples) and 2 bags of oranges (10 oranges), still not equal.\n\n3 bags of apples (12 apples) and 3 bags of oranges (15 oranges), not equal.\n\n4 bags of apples (16 apples) and 4 bags of oranges (20 oranges), not equal.\n\n5 bags of apples (20 apples) and 5 bags of oranges (25 oranges), not equal.\n\nWait, in all these cases, the number of apples and oranges aren't equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to buy different numbers of bags to make the totals equal.\n\nFor example, suppose I buy 5 bags of apples (20 apples) and 4 bags of oranges (20 oranges). Ah, that gives me 20 apples and 20 oranges, which is equal.\n\nIs there a combination where I can buy fewer bags and still have equal numbers?\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf I buy 3 bags of apples (12 apples) and 2 bags of oranges (10 oranges), that's not equal.\n\nIf I buy 4 bags of apples (16 apples) and 3 bags of oranges (15 oranges), still not equal.\n\n5 bags of apples (20 apples) and 4 bags of oranges (20 oranges) works.\n\nIf I try 6 bags of apples (24 apples) and 5 bags of oranges (25 oranges), not equal.\n\n7 bags of apples (28 apples) and 6 bags of oranges (30 oranges), not equal.\n\nIt seems like 20 is the smallest number where the totals are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mathematical way to find this.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of equations.\n\nLet A be the number of bags of apples, and O be the number of bags of oranges.\n\nThen, the total number of apples is 4A, and the total number of oranges is 5O.\n\nI want 4A = 5O.\n\nI need to find positive integers A and O that satisfy this equation.\n\nSo, 4A = 5O.\n\nI can rearrange this to A = (5/4)O.\n\nSince A and O have to be integers, O must be a multiple of 4 to make A an integer.\n\nLet O = 4k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nThen A = (5/4)*(4k) = 5k.\n\nSo, for any positive integer k, A = 5k and O = 4k will give equal numbers of apples and oranges.\n\nThe total number of each fruit would be 4A = 4*(5k) = 20k.\n\nSo, the smallest k is 1, which gives A = 5, O = 4, and total fruits of 20 each.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of each fruit I must buy is 20.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the minimum number of each fruit, not the total.\n\nSo, the minimum number of apples is 20, and the minimum number of oranges is 20.\n\nBut maybe it's asking for the minimum number of bags?\n\nNo, it's asking for the minimum number of each fruit.\n\nSo, the answer is 20 apples and 20 oranges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to interpret this differently.\n\nLet me check again.\n\n\"The minimum number of each fruit that you must buy.\"\n\nSo, it's about the smallest equal quantities of apples and oranges, given their packaging constraints.\n\nYes, 20 seems to be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD), but I don't think that's applicable here.\n\nWait, no, actually, LCM is more appropriate, which is what I used.\n\nSo, I think 20 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if there's any smaller number that satisfies the condition.\n\nSuppose someone says 10.\n\nBut 10 is not a multiple of 4 for apples, since 10 divided by 4 is 2.5, which isn't an integer.\n\nSo, I can't buy 10 apples because apples come in bags of 4.\n\nSimilarly, 15 is a multiple of 5 for oranges, but 15 divided by 4 is 3.75, which isn't an integer, so can't buy 15 apples.\n\n20 seems to be the smallest number that is a multiple of both 4 and 5.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of each fruit I must buy is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
