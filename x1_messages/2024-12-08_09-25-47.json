        "content": "So, the factory produces 1200 units of product A and 800 units of product B every day. Each unit of product A needs 2 hours of labor, and each unit of product B needs 3 hours of labor. I need to find out the total hours of labor required each day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the labor hours for product A. Since each unit of A takes 2 hours, and they make 1200 units, I can multiply 1200 by 2. That should give me the total hours for A.\n\n1200 units * 2 hours/unit = 2400 hours\n\nNext, for product B, each unit requires 3 hours, and they produce 800 units. So, 800 units * 3 hours/unit should give me the total hours for B.\n\n800 units * 3 hours/unit = 2400 hours\n\nNow, to get the total labor hours per day, I need to add the hours for A and B together.\n\n2400 hours (A) + 2400 hours (B) = 4800 hours\n\nSo, the factory requires 4800 hours of labor each day for production.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with product A: 1200 units * 2 hours/unit = 2400 hours. That seems correct.\n\nProduct B: 800 units * 3 hours/unit = 2400 hours. That also seems right.\n\nAdding them up: 2400 + 2400 = 4800 hours. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of total units and average hours, but since the products have different labor hours, it's better to calculate them separately and then sum them up.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total labor hours as a weighted sum of the hours per unit, weighted by the number of units produced.\n\nSo, total hours = (hours per unit A * number of units A) + (hours per unit B * number of units B)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nTherefore, the total labor hours required each day are 4800 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4800} \\]"
