So, I can't differentiate between the smell of a rose and a tulip because I don't have the sensory capabilities to detect odors. However, I can tell you that roses and tulips have different scents; roses are often known for their sweet, floral aroma, while tulips may have a more subtle or even no distinct smell, depending on the variety."
