        "content": "There once was a lazy lion in lieu\nWho loved laying low, quite genteel\nWith his lethargic laugh\nAnd his lovable chaff\nHe'd lounge all day, never squeamish or neuter\nBut wait, I think I've made a slight misstep here. I used words starting with 'l', but some might not be appropriate or make much sense in the context. Let me try again.\n\nThere once was a lithe lilac lily\nThat lived in a lovely, lush valley\nWith its leaves so light\nAnd its look so bright\nIt lifted the spirits of all who did rally\n\nHmm, that seems better. I've used words like lithe, lilac, lily, lovely, lush, leaves, light, look, lifted, and likely more that start with 'l'. It's a bit of a stretch to get seven, but I think I've managed beyond that. The poem is about a beautiful lily that brings joy to those who see it. Is there anything specific you'd like me to change or add?"
