The explorers are: Christopher Columbus, Marco Polo, David Livingstone, Roald Amundsen, Vasco da Gama, and Neil Armstrong. Okay, let's tackle this one by one.\n\nFirst up, Christopher Columbus. I know that he is famous for his voyages to the Americas. He was an Italian explorer who sailed for the Spanish monarchy, and his expeditions in the late 15th century led to the European discovery of the Americas. So, it's safe to say that he primarily explored North and South America.\n\nNext, Marco Polo. He was a Venetian trader and explorer who is famous for his travels to Asia, particularly China, during the 13th century. He traveled along the Silk Road and spent many years in the court of Kublai Khan. So, Marco Polo primarily explored Asia.\n\nDavid Livingstone is another explorer on the list. He was a Scottish missionary and explorer who is well-known for his expeditions in Africa during the 19th century. He explored central and southeastern Africa, and his journeys contributed significantly to European knowledge of the African continent. So, David Livingstone primarily explored Africa.\n\nRoald Amundsen is a name associated with polar exploration. He was a Norwegian explorer who led the first expedition to reach the South Pole in 1911. He is also known for being the first to navigate the Northwest Passage. So, Amundsen primarily explored Antarctica and the Arctic regions.\n\nVasco da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who is famous for being the first European to reach India by sea, linking Europe and Asia via the Indian Ocean. His voyage in 1498 opened up a new trade route and had a significant impact on the global spice trade. So, Vasco da Gama primarily explored Asia, specifically India and the surrounding areas.\n\nLastly, Neil Armstrong. He is renowned as an astronaut and the first person to set foot on the Moon as part of NASA's Apollo 11 mission in 1969. While the Moon isn't a continent, it's a significant exploration in the field of space. So, Neil Armstrong primarily explored space and the Moon.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Christopher Columbus: Americas (North and South America)\n\n- Marco Polo: Asia\n\n- David Livingstone: Africa\n\n- Roald Amundsen: Antarctica and Arctic regions\n\n- Vasco da Gama: Asia (India and surrounding areas)\n\n- Neil Armstrong: Space and the Moon\n\nI think that covers it. It's interesting to see the diverse areas these explorers ventured into, from the depths of Africa to the vastness of space."
