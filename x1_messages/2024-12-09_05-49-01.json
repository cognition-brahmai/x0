        "content": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x - 2}{3} + 5 = 7\\]\n\nFirst, I want to isolate the fraction on one side. To do that, I can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x - 2}{3} + 5 - 5 = 7 - 5\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x - 2}{3} = 2\\]\n\nNow, to eliminate the denominator, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times \\frac{4x - 2}{3} = 2 \\times 3\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[4x - 2 = 6\\]\n\nNext, I'll add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n\\[4x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[4x = 8\\]\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x}{4} = \\frac{8}{4}\\]\n\nSo, x equals:\n\n\\[x = 2\\]\n\nTo make sure, I can plug x back into the original equation to check if it holds true:\n\n\\[\\frac{4(2) - 2}{3} + 5 = \\frac{8 - 2}{3} + 5 = \\frac{6}{3} + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\\]\n\nYes, it checks out. So the solution is x = 2."
