        "content": "Let's see... I need to figure out which transportation method was primarily used during the 15th century. So, first things first, I should probably have a sense of what was going on in the world back then.\n\nThe 15th century spans from 1401 to 1500. That's right, it's part of the Middle Ages in Europe, and it's also a time when a lot of exploration was happening, like the Age of Discovery. So, thinking about exploration, what did they use to travel long distances?\n\nOption A is sailing ships. That sounds plausible because sailing ships were definitely used for exploration during that time. I remember learning about explorers like Christopher Columbus, who sailed across the Atlantic in the late 15th century. So, sailing ships were definitely a thing back then.\n\nOption B is automobiles. Hmm, automobiles? Were there automobiles in the 15th century? I don't think so. Cars, as we know them, were invented much later, right? Like in the 19th and early 20th centuries. So, automobiles probably weren't around in the 15th century.\n\nOption C is trains. Trains? Again, trains were a product of the Industrial Revolution, which started in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. So, that's way after the 15th century. Trains weren't used for transportation back then.\n\nOption D is airplanes. Airplanes? That's even more obvious. The first controlled, powered airplane flight was in the early 20th century by the Wright brothers. So, airplanes weren't around in the 15th century at all.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like sailing ships were the primary method of transportation, especially for long-distance travel and exploration during the 15th century.\n\nBut wait, what about land transportation? Were there other methods used during that time? Certainly, people traveled by horse, cart, or on foot. So, maybe for land travel, sailing ships weren't the primary method.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the primary method of transportation during the 15th century, and considering the context of exploration and the fact that sailing ships were crucial for traversing oceans and discovering new lands, I think sailing ships were indeed the primary method, especially for long-distance travel.\n\nAlso, in terms of trade, sailing ships were essential for transporting goods across seas, which was a major part of the economy during that time.\n\nSo, to sum it up, sailing ships were the primary transportation method during the 15th century, especially for exploration and trade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
