I've heard that spicy foods can make your eyes water and your mouth burn, but people still eat them because they like the flavor. So, maybe that's the answer? But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's another answer I'm not thinking of. Let me think some more. Could it be something acidic, like lemon juice? That can sting the mouth and maybe make eyes water if it gets in them, but I feel like chili peppers make more sense. What do you think?"
