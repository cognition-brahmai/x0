        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people in a room, and everyone shakes hands with each other exactly once. I need to find out how many handshakes occur in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many people there are and how handshakes work. Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for example, Tom shakes hands with everyone except himself, right? Same with Jane and the other three people.\n\nLet me try to count the handshakes one by one. If there are 5 people, and each shakes hands with 4 others, that would suggest 5 times 4, which is 20 handshakes. But wait, that counts each handshake twice because when Tom shakes hands with Jane, it's the same as Jane shaking hands with Tom. So, I need to divide that number by 2 to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, 20 divided by 2 is 10. Maybe there are 10 handshakes in total.\n\nLet me check this with a smaller number to see if my logic is correct. Suppose there are 3 people: A, B, and C. A shakes hands with B and C (2 handshakes), B shakes hands with A and C (2 handshakes), and C shakes hands with A and B (2 handshakes). That's a total of 6 handshakes, but again, each handshake is counted twice. So, 6 divided by 2 is 3, which makes sense because there should be 3 unique handshakes: A-B, A-C, and B-C.\n\nApplying the same logic to the original problem: 5 people, each shaking hands with 4 others, total of 20 handshakes, divided by 2 to account for double-counting, equals 10 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a formula for this kind of problem. It's called \"combination,\" where you choose 2 people out of 5 to shake hands. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 and k = 2 because a handshake involves 2 people.\n\nSo, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (120) / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.\n\nAgain, that gives me 10 handshakes, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can list all possible handshakes:\n\n1. Tom - Jane\n\n2. Tom - Person A\n\n3. Tom - Person B\n\n4. Tom - Person C\n\n5. Jane - Person A\n\n6. Jane - Person B\n\n7. Jane - Person C\n\n8. Person A - Person B\n\n9. Person A - Person C\n\n10. Person B - Person C\n\nThat's 10 handshakes, which matches my previous calculations.\n\nI think this makes sense. So, the answer should be 10 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
