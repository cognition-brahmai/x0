        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system. They have a current fleet of 100 buses, each with a capacity of 50 passengers. They want to increase the total passenger capacity by 25% and also extend the average route length by 20% without reducing the frequency of service. We need to find out how many additional buses are needed and the total increase in route miles required.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. The city wants to increase the total passenger capacity by 25%. That means the overall number of passengers that the bus system can carry at once needs to go up by 25%. Additionally, they want to extend the average route length by 20% without changing the service frequency. So, buses will be traveling longer routes, but they won't be running more or less frequently than before.\n\nLet's start by calculating the current total passenger capacity. With 100 buses, each carrying 50 passengers, the total capacity is:\n\nTotal capacity = number of buses \u00d7 capacity per bus\nTotal capacity = 100 \u00d7 50 = 5000 passengers\n\nNow, they want to increase this capacity by 25%. So, the increase in capacity needed is:\n\nIncrease in capacity = current total capacity \u00d7 25%\nIncrease in capacity = 5000 \u00d7 0.25 = 1250 passengers\n\nTherefore, the new total capacity should be:\n\nNew total capacity = current total capacity + increase in capacity\nNew total capacity = 5000 + 1250 = 6250 passengers\n\nNow, to achieve this new total capacity, we need to find out how many additional buses are required. Each new bus also has a capacity of 50 passengers. Let's denote the number of additional buses needed as x.\n\nSo, the equation will be:\n\n(current number of buses + additional buses) \u00d7 capacity per bus = new total capacity\n(100 + x) \u00d7 50 = 6250\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n(100 + x) \u00d7 50 = 6250\n100 + x = 6250 / 50\n100 + x = 125\nx = 125 - 100\nx = 25\n\nSo, the city needs to add 25 additional buses to achieve the 25% increase in passenger capacity.\n\nNext, let's look at the route extension. The city wants to extend the average route length by 20% without reducing the frequency of service. This means that each bus will be traveling a longer route, but they won't be adding or removing buses from the routes in terms of frequency.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what \"without reducing the frequency of service\" means. Frequency of service usually refers to how often a bus comes on a particular route. If they don't want to reduce this frequency, it means that the time interval between buses remains the same.\n\nHowever, if the routes are extended, meaning that the distance each bus travels is increased, but the frequency remains the same, this could imply that the buses are taking longer to complete their routes, but the number of buses on each route is adjusted accordingly to maintain the same frequency.\n\nBut in this problem, we've already determined that they are adding buses to increase capacity. So, perhaps the additional buses will help to cover the extended routes without reducing frequency.\n\nTo calculate the total increase in route miles, we need to know the current total route miles and then find the 20% increase.\n\nLet's denote the current average route length as L miles. With 100 buses, the total route miles would be:\n\nTotal current route miles = number of buses \u00d7 average route length\nTotal current route miles = 100 \u00d7 L\n\nNow, with the average route length extended by 20%, the new average route length is:\n\nNew average route length = L + (0.20 \u00d7 L) = 1.20L\n\nWith the same number of buses (but increased to 125 buses after adding 25), the total new route miles would be:\n\nTotal new route miles = new number of buses \u00d7 new average route length\nTotal new route miles = 125 \u00d7 1.20L = 150L\n\nThe increase in total route miles is:\n\nIncrease in route miles = total new route miles - total current route miles\nIncrease in route miles = 150L - 100L = 50L\n\nSo, the total increase in route miles required is 50 times the current average route length.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific value of L, we can't calculate a numerical value for the increase in route miles. But based on the information given, the increase is 50L miles.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Current fleet: 100 buses\n\n- Each bus has a capacity of 50 passengers\n\n- Total current capacity: 100 \u00d7 50 = 5000 passengers\n\n- Desired increase in capacity: 25%\n\n- Increase in capacity: 5000 \u00d7 0.25 = 1250 passengers\n\n- New total capacity: 5000 + 1250 = 6250 passengers\n\n- Each new bus also has a capacity of 50 passengers\n\n- Number of additional buses needed: x\n\n- (100 + x) \u00d7 50 = 6250\n\n- Solving for x: x = 25\n\nSo, 25 additional buses are needed.\n\nNow, regarding the route extension:\n\n- Average route length to be increased by 20%\n\n- Frequency of service remains the same\n\nWe need to find the total increase in route miles.\n\nAssuming that the number of buses remains the same, but each bus travels a longer route, the total route miles would increase by 20%. However, since we are adding buses, it might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the additional buses are used to cover the extended routes.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the current total route miles are R miles (with 100 buses, each traveling L miles on average, so R = 100L).\n\nNow, they want to extend the average route length by 20%, so the new average route length is 1.20L miles.\n\nWith the same number of buses (100), the total route miles would become 100 \u00d7 1.20L = 120L miles.\n\nBut we are adding 25 buses, bringing the total to 125 buses.\n\nIf all 125 buses travel the new average route length of 1.20L miles, the total route miles would be:\n\nTotal new route miles = 125 \u00d7 1.20L = 150L miles\n\nTherefore, the increase in total route miles is:\n\nIncrease = 150L - 100L = 50L miles\n\nSo, the total increase in route miles required is 50L miles.\n\nBut perhaps there is a better way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, since the frequency of service remains the same, and the routes are extended, the buses need to cover more distance in the same amount of time.\n\nIf the frequency remains the same, and the routes are longer, that might imply that the buses are taking longer to complete their routes, but the frequency (the time between buses) stays the same.\n\nHowever, in this problem, since we are adding buses, perhaps the additional buses are used to cover the extended routes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing buses cover the extended routes, and the additional buses provide extra capacity.\n\nThis might be getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try to simplify.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Current: 100 buses, each with 50 seats, total capacity 5000 passengers\n\n- Desired: increase capacity by 25%, so new total capacity is 6250 passengers\n\n- Each bus has the same capacity, so number of additional buses needed is (6250 - 5000)/50 = 25 buses\n\n- So, total buses after upgrade: 125 buses\n\nNow, they also want to extend the average route length by 20%.\n\nAssuming that the average route length is the distance each bus travels in one cycle.\n\nIf the average route length is extended by 20%, and the frequency remains the same, then each bus is traveling 20% farther in the same amount of time.\n\nAlternatively, if the frequency remains the same, but the routes are longer, the buses might need more cycles to cover the same time period.\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to think in terms of total route miles.\n\nCurrent total route miles: 100 buses \u00d7 L miles each = 100L miles\n\nNew average route length: 1.20L miles\n\nTotal new route miles: 125 buses \u00d7 1.20L miles = 150L miles\n\nTherefore, the increase in total route miles is 150L - 100L = 50L miles\n\nSo, the total increase in route miles required is 50L miles.\n\nBut maybe there's a different way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frequency remains the same, meaning that the time between buses doesn't change, but the routes are extended.\n\nIn that case, to maintain the same frequency, more buses might be needed to cover the extended routes.\n\nBut we've already calculated that 25 additional buses are needed for the capacity increase.\n\nNow, for the route extension, if the routes are extended by 20%, and the frequency remains the same, then the total route miles increase by 20% per bus.\n\nWith 100 buses, the increase would be 100 \u00d7 (0.20L) = 20L miles\n\nBut we are adding 25 more buses, each traveling the new average route length of 1.20L miles.\n\nSo, the additional route miles covered by the new buses would be 25 \u00d7 1.20L = 30L miles\n\nTherefore, the total increase in route miles would be the increase due to extended routes plus the route miles covered by the new buses.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the total route miles before and after the upgrade.\n\nBefore:\n\n- 100 buses, each traveling L miles\n\n- Total route miles: 100L\n\nAfter:\n\n- 125 buses, each traveling 1.20L miles\n\n- Total route miles: 125 \u00d7 1.20L = 150L miles\n\nTherefore, the increase in total route miles is 150L - 100L = 50L miles\n\nSo, the total increase in route miles required is 50L miles.\n\nI think this is the correct approach.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Number of additional buses needed: 25\n\n- Total increase in route miles required: 50L miles, where L is the current average route length.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25 \\text{ additional buses and } 50L \\text{ miles increase in route length}} \\]"
