        "content": "So John can paint a house in 5 hours, and Mary can do it in 4 hours. We need to find out how long it will take them to paint the house together.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how much of the house each of them can paint in one hour. That way, I can see how much they can do together in an hour.\n\nSo, John can paint the whole house in 5 hours. That means in one hour, he can paint 1/5 of the house.\n\nSimilarly, Mary can paint the whole house in 4 hours, so in one hour, she can paint 1/4 of the house.\n\nNow, if they work together, their painting speeds should add up. So, in one hour, together they can paint 1/5 + 1/4 of the house.\n\nTo add those fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 5 and 4, so the least common multiple is 20.\n\nSo, 1/5 is equal to 4/20, and 1/4 is equal to 5/20.\n\nAdding those together: 4/20 + 5/20 = 9/20.\n\nThat means, together, they can paint 9/20 of the house in one hour.\n\nNow, to find out how long it will take them to paint the whole house, I need to divide the whole house (which is 1) by their combined rate of 9/20 per hour.\n\nSo, time = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours.\n\n20/9 hours is the same as 2 hours and 2/9 of an hour.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2/9 of an hour is (2/9)*60 = 13.333... minutes.\n\nSo, approximately, it would take them 2 hours and 13 minutes to paint the house together.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for combined work rates. If one person can do a job in a certain time, and another in a different time, the time it takes for them to do it together is given by the formula:\n\nTime together = (individual times) / (sum of individual times)\n\nWait, actually, the formula I recall is:\n\n1 / (1/a + 1/b)\n\nWhere a and b are the individual times.\n\nWait, that's similar to what I did earlier.\n\nLet me see: for John, a = 5 hours; for Mary, b = 4 hours.\n\nSo, combined rate is 1/a + 1/b = 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20, as before.\n\nThen, time together is 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours, same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen sometimes people use the concept of work done.\n\nIf they work together, their rates add up.\n\nSo, again, it leads to the same conclusion.\n\nI think 20/9 hours is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of how much each paints in a certain time.\n\nSuppose they work together for t hours.\n\nIn t hours, John paints (1/5)*t of the house.\n\nMary paints (1/4)*t of the house.\n\nTogether, they paint (1/5)t + (1/4)t = (9/20)t of the house.\n\nWe want this to be equal to 1 house.\n\nSo, (9/20)t = 1\n\nTherefore, t = 20/9 hours.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nSo, it will take them 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.222 hours, or 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps I should leave it in fractions for more precision.\n\nAlternatively, if the question expects the answer in hours and minutes, I can convert it accordingly.\n\n20/9 hours is 2 hours plus 2/9 of an hour.\n\n2/9 of an hour is (2/9)*60 minutes = 13.333... minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, for more precision, 0.333... minutes is 20 seconds.\n\nSo, 2 hours, 13 minutes, and 20 seconds.\n\nBut maybe in the context of this problem, rounding to the nearest minute is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nWait, but the problem might expect the answer in hours as a fraction.\n\nLooking back, the problem says \"how long will it take them to paint the house?\" and earlier parts had answers like 5 hours, 4 hours, etc.\n\nSo perhaps it's acceptable to leave it as 20/9 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if it expects a decimal, that would be approximately 2.222 hours.\n\nBut I think expressing it as a fraction is more precise and appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 20/9 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{20}{9}\\text{ hours}} \\]"
