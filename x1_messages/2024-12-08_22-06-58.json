        "content": "So, the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours. I need to find out how long it takes to travel 50 miles at the same speed. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the speed of the train. Speed is usually calculated as distance divided by time, right? So, if the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours, the speed would be 100 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 50 miles per hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it takes to travel 50 miles at this speed. If the speed is 50 miles per hour, then time is equal to distance divided by speed, I think. So, time equals 50 miles divided by 50 miles per hour. That would be 1 hour.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? If the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours, that's 50 miles per hour. So, for 50 miles, it should take half the time, which is 1 hour. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check. Another way to think about it is to set up a proportion. If 100 miles corresponds to 2 hours, then 50 miles would correspond to x hours. So, 100 miles / 2 hours = 50 miles / x hours. Simplifying that, 50 = 50 / x. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, better to set it up as 100 / 2 = 50 / x. So, 50 = 50 / x. Then, x = 50 / 50, which is 1 hour. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at it? Maybe using the formula: time = distance / speed. I already know the speed is 50 mph, so time = 50 miles / 50 mph = 1 hour.\n\nAlternatively, since the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours, in 1 hour it would travel 50 miles. So, to travel 50 miles, it would take 1 hour. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the speed is constant throughout. If the speed is constant, then yes, it's straightforward. But if the speed varies, then maybe not. However, the problem says \"at the same speed,\" so I can assume the speed is constant.\n\nAlso, I should consider units. All measurements are in miles and hours, so no need to convert anything.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor to consider. Is there any rest stop or something? The problem doesn't mention any, so I can assume the train is moving continuously at the same speed.\n\nSo, finally, the answer should be 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
