He is best known for his theory of general relativity, which revolutionized the concept of gravity, and his mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc\u00b2, which is fundamental in nuclear physics. Einstein's work also had profound impacts on the development of quantum theory, despite his reservations about some of its implications.\n\nHis major contributions to science include:\n\n- **Theory of General Relativity**: Published in 1915, this theory describes gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. It has been confirmed through various observations and experiments, such as the bending of light by gravity and the precise orbit calculations of planets.\n\n- **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc\u00b2)**: This formula expresses the relationship between mass and energy, stating that energy (E) equals mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared. It has profound implications in nuclear reactions and the understanding of fundamental particles.\n\n- **Photoelectric Effect**: Einstein's explanation of this phenomenon, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, laid the foundation for quantum mechanics by demonstrating that light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons.\n\n- **Brownian Motion**: His mathematical description of the random movement of particles in fluids provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules.\n\nAlbert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. The birthplace can be located using geographic data, and it is situated in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in the German federal republic.\n\nThrough this comprehensive approach, we have gathered and synthesized information from multiple sources to provide a detailed response to the user's query about Albert Einstein's life, contributions, and birthplace."
