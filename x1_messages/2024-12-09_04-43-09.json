        "content": "So, the train is moving at an average speed of 90 kilometers per hour, and it takes 3 hours to get to its destination. I need to find out how far the destination is from where the train started.\n\nI remember that when we talk about speed, time, and distance, there's a formula that connects them. The formula is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 90 km/h, and the time is 3 hours. So, if I plug these values into the formula, it should give me the distance.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\nDistance = 90 km/h \u00d7 3 h\n\nNow, when I multiply 90 by 3, I get 270. And the units are kilometers per hour multiplied by hours. The hours cancel out, leaving just kilometers.\n\nSo, Distance = 270 kilometers\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this problem to make sure I'm not missing anything?\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of how far the train travels each hour. If it's going at 90 kilometers per hour, that means every hour it covers 90 kilometers.\n\nSo, in one hour, it covers 90 km.\n\nIn two hours, it would cover 90 km \u00d7 2 = 180 km.\n\nIn three hours, it would cover 90 km \u00d7 3 = 270 km.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of rate. Speed is a rate, specifically the rate at which distance is covered over time.\n\nSo, rate \u00d7 time = distance.\n\nAgain, 90 km/h \u00d7 3 h = 270 km.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check if there's any need to consider other factors, like acceleration or stops along the way.\n\nBut the problem says the train travels at an average speed of 90 km/h. That means any speeding up or slowing down is already accounted for in the average speed.\n\nSo, I don't need to worry about initial or final speeds, just the average speed.\n\nAlso, it's a straightforward problem without any mention of different speeds or changes in direction, so I can stick with the basic formula.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use dimensional analysis to ensure the units make sense.\n\nI have speed in km/h and time in hours.\n\nWhen I multiply them, the hours unit cancels out, leaving kilometers, which is the unit for distance.\n\nThat makes sense dimensionally.\n\nSo, all signs point to the destination being 270 kilometers away from the starting point.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 270 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
