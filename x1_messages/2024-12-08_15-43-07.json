        "content": "Alright, I need to find out the height of Mount Everest and which country it's in. I have a few tools at my disposal: MountainStats, CountryLocator, QA, GoogleEarth, and Wikipedia. Let's think about the best way to approach this.\n\nFirst, since Mount Everest is a mountain, the MountainStats tool seems directly relevant for getting its height. So, I'll start by using that.\n\nPlan: Use MountainStats to find the height of Mount Everest.\n#E1 = MountainStats[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\nNow, regarding the country it's in, mountains can span across borders, so it might be in more than one country. The CountryLocator tool can help with that, but I should make sure to specify Mount Everest correctly.\n\nPlan: Use CountryLocator to find the country(s) where Mount Everest is located.\n#E2 = CountryLocator[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, maybe I can cross-verify this information using another tool like Wikipedia or GoogleEarth.\n\nPlan: Check Wikipedia for information on Mount Everest to confirm the height and location.\n#E3 = Wikipedia[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\nAlternatively, GoogleEarth could provide geographical data that includes its location and height.\n\nPlan: Use GoogleEarth to get geographical data about Mount Everest.\n#E4 = GoogleEarth[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\nBut since MountainStats is specifically for mountains, it might be more reliable for the height, and CountryLocator for the location. Maybe I can use QA to reconcile the information from these sources.\n\nPlan: If there are discrepancies between #E1, #E2, #E3, and #E4, use QA to resolve them.\n#E5 = QA[\"Compare the height and location of Mount Everest from #E1, #E2, #E3, and #E4. Determine the most accurate information.\"]\n\nWait, maybe that's overkill. Perhaps starting with MountainStats and CountryLocator will suffice, and only resort to other tools if needed.\n\n Revised Plan:\n\n1. Use MountainStats to find the height of Mount Everest.\n   #E1 = MountainStats[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\n2. Use CountryLocator to find which country Mount Everest is in.\n   #E2 = CountryLocator[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\n3. If needed, cross-verify with Wikipedia.\n   #E3 = Wikipedia[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\n4. If there are any inconsistencies, use QA to determine the correct information.\n   #E4 = QA[\"Based on #E1, #E2, and #E3, what is the accurate height and location of Mount Everest?\"]\n\nBut considering time efficiency, maybe just steps 1 and 2 will be enough.\n\nFinal Plan:\n\n1. Use MountainStats to find the height of Mount Everest.\n   #E1 = MountainStats[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\n2. Use CountryLocator to find which country Mount Everest is in.\n   #E2 = CountryLocator[\"Mount Everest\"]\n\n3. Present the information from #E1 and #E2 as the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nHeight of Mount Everest: #E1\n\nCountry: #E2"
