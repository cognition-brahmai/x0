Heracles is famous for his incredible strength and for completing the Twelve Labors, which were assigned to him by King Eurystheus as a form of penance for a crime he didn't commit. These labors included slaying the Nemean Lion, capturing the Erymanthian Boar, and cleaning the Augean stables in a single day, among others. His story is filled with adventures, battles against mythical creatures, and feats of extraordinary strength."
