        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a square garden with an area of 256 square meters, and I need to figure out how much it's going to cost to build a fence around it if the fence costs $10 per meter. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the garden is square, all four sides are equal in length. The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side. So, if the area is 256 square meters, that means the length of one side is the square root of 256. Let me calculate that.\n\nThe square root of 256 is 16. So, each side of the square garden is 16 meters long.\n\nNext, to find out the total length of the fence needed, I need to calculate the perimeter of the square. The perimeter is the sum of all four sides. Since all sides are equal, the perimeter P is 4 times the length of one side.\n\nSo, P = 4 * 16 = 64 meters.\n\nNow, the cost of the fence is $10 per meter. Therefore, the total cost C will be the perimeter multiplied by the cost per meter.\n\nC = P * 10 = 64 * 10 = $640.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check. The area is given, and I found the side length by taking the square root of the area. Then, I calculated the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4, which seems correct. Finally, multiplying the perimeter by the cost per meter gives me the total cost. It seems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the cost, like gates or corners needing more material, but the problem doesn't mention any additional requirements beyond building a fence around the garden. So, I think $640 is the correct total cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{640} \\]"
