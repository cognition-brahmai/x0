        "content": "This is a classic logic puzzle, and it's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out. So, there are two doors: one leads to death, and the other leads to a million dollars. There are also two robots: one always tells the truth, and the other always lies. I don't know which robot is which, nor which door is which, and I can only ask one question to one of the robots.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what kind of question would give me information about both the doors and the robots' nature. Since I don't know which robot is the truth-teller and which is the liar, I need a question that will give me the correct information regardless of which robot I ask.\n\nLet me consider asking directly about the doors. For example, I could ask a robot, \"Which door leads to the million dollars?\" But the problem is, if I ask the liar, it will point me to the death door, and if I ask the truth-teller, it will point me to the million dollars. Since I don't know which robot I'm asking, this approach won't work because I might get the wrong door.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to ask a question that involves both robots and the doors. Perhaps something like, \"If I were to ask the other robot which door leads to the million dollars, what would it say?\" Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose I ask the truth-teller about what the liar would say. The truth-teller will accurately report what the liar would say, which would be the wrong door, since the liar always lies. So, the truth-teller would point to the death door, saying that's what the liar would claim is the million-dollar door.\n\nOn the other hand, if I ask the liar about what the truth-teller would say, the liar would lie about what the truth-teller would say. The truth-teller would correctly point to the million-dollar door, but the liar would lie and point to the death door.\n\nSo, in both cases, when I ask either robot about what the other robot would say, I get pointed to the death door. Therefore, if I ask either robot, \"What would the other robot say is the million-dollar door?\", they will both point to the death door\u2014either accurately reporting the liar's lie or lying about the truth-teller's truth.\n\nThat means, if I get a door pointed out by either robot in response to this question, I should choose the opposite door to get to the million dollars.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to phrase this question to make it clearer? Maybe I can ask, \"Which door would your counterpart suggest I take?\" Again, the truth-teller would truthfully report the liar's suggestion, which is the wrong door, and the liar would lie about the truth-teller's suggestion, again pointing to the wrong door.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, the answer I get points to the death door, and I should choose the other door to find the million dollars.\n\nLet me test this logic with an example. Suppose Door A leads to the million dollars, and Door B leads to death. The truth-teller knows this and would truthfully say that the liar would point to Door B (since the liar always lies). The liar knows that the truth-teller would point to Door A, so the liar would lie and say Door B.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, I get Door B as the answer, which is the death door, and I should choose Door A.\n\nThis seems consistent. So, the strategy is to ask either robot, \"Which door would the other robot suggest I take?\", and then choose the opposite door of what I'm told.\n\nIs there another way to approach this puzzle? Maybe I can ask a question that makes both robots point to the million-dollar door directly.\n\nLet's think about that. If I ask the truth-teller, \"Which door leads to the million dollars?\", it will point to the correct door. If I ask the liar, \"Which door leads to the million dollars?\", it will point to the death door.\n\nThat's not helpful because I don't know which one is which. So, I need a question where both robots, regardless of whether they lie or tell the truth, point me to the correct door or to the wrong door in a consistent manner.\n\nWait, maybe I can ask, \"If I were to ask you which door leads to the million dollars, which door would you suggest?\" For the truth-teller, it would say the correct door. For the liar, since it always lies, it would say the wrong door.\n\nThat doesn't help because I get different answers from each robot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ask, \"Which door would you suggest I take if you were telling the truth?\" But this might be too convoluted.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose I ask a robot, \"Which door would you suggest if you were the other robot?\" So, if I ask the truth-teller, it would imagine itself as the liar and point to the death door. If I ask the liar, it would imagine itself as the truth-teller and lie about it, so it would also point to the death door.\n\nAgain, both robots point to the death door, so I should choose the opposite door.\n\nThis seems similar to my first approach.\n\nIs there a way to directly find the correct door without having to choose the opposite? Maybe I need to ask a different kind of question.\n\nLet's consider asking about what the robot itself thinks. For example, \"Do you think this door leads to the million dollars?\" But then I don't know if it's lying or telling the truth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ask, \"Is this door the million-dollar door?\" and then consider the answer in light of whether the robot is a truth-teller or a liar.\n\nBut the problem is that I don't know which robot is which, so I have to find a question where the answer is consistent across both types of robots.\n\nMaybe I should ask a counterfactual question. Like, \"If I were to ask you 'Are you the truth-teller?', would you say yes?\" The truth-teller would say yes, and the liar would also say yes, because it would lie about being a truth-teller. So, both would say yes, which doesn't help.\n\nWait, that's not helpful. I need a question where the answers diverge in a useful way.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Suppose I ask one robot, \"Which door do you think I should choose to get to the million dollars?\" The truth-teller would point to the correct door, and the liar would point to the wrong door.\n\nAgain, that doesn't help because I don't know which one is lying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ask, \"Which door would you choose if you were me?\" The truth-teller would point to the million-dollar door, and the liar would point to the death door.\n\nSame issue as before.\n\nWait, maybe I can ask, \"If I were to choose the other door, what would happen?\" But that still doesn't directly tell me which door to choose.\n\nLet me consider a more complex question. Suppose I ask a robot, \"If I were to ask you which door leads to the million dollars, and you were to answer truthfully, which door would you point to?\" The truth-teller would point to the million-dollar door, but the liar, since it's forced to lie, would point to the death door.\n\nSo, in this case, if I ask this question, I get two different answers depending on who I ask. If I ask the truth-teller, I get the correct door, if I ask the liar, I get the wrong door.\n\nThat's not helpful because I don't know which one I'm asking.\n\nWait, maybe I can combine this with another layer of indirection. Suppose I ask, \"If I were to ask you which door leads to the million dollars, and you were to answer as truthfully as you can, which door would you point to?\" The truth-teller would point to the million-dollar door, and the liar would have to lie about what it would do, which is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about what the liar would do in this scenario.\n\nIf I ask the liar, \"If I were to ask you which door leads to the million dollars, and you were to answer as truthfully as you can, which door would you point to?\" The liar has to lie about what it would do if it were telling the truth. So, if it were telling the truth, it would point to the million-dollar door, but since it's lying, it would point to the death door.\n\nSimilarly, the truth-teller would truthfully report which door it would point to if it were telling the truth, which is the million-dollar door.\n\nSo, in this case, both robots would point to the million-dollar door.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's check.\n\nFor the truth-teller: It would truthfully say which door it would point to if it were telling the truth, which is the million-dollar door.\n\nFor the liar: It would lie about which door it would point to if it were telling the truth. If it were telling the truth, it would point to the million-dollar door, but since it's lying, it would point to the death door.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory to my earlier thought.\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, this approach doesn't work because the liar is lying about what it would do if it were telling the truth. So, it's a bit too convoluted.\n\nI think my initial approach is still the best: ask either robot, \"Which door would the other robot suggest I take?\", and then choose the opposite door of what is indicated.\n\nThis way, regardless of whether I'm asking the truth-teller or the liar, I get a pointer to the death door, and I can safely choose the other door to find the million dollars.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to ask a question where both robots point me to the correct door directly?\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose I ask a robot, \"Which door would both of you agree on?\" The truth-teller would point to the million-dollar door, and the liar would also point to the million-dollar door, because the liar would lie about the agreement.\n\nWait, let's explore that.\n\nIf I ask the truth-teller, it would only point to a door that both robots agree on. Since the truth-teller points to the million-dollar door and the liar points to the death door, there is no agreement. So, the truth-teller couldn't point to any door in this case.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because the truth-teller can't point to a door that both agree on, since they don't agree.\n\nThis approach seems flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ask, \"Which door do you and the other robot disagree on?\" The truth-teller would point to the million-dollar door, since the liar disagrees by pointing to the death door. The liar would point to the death door, lying about the door they disagree on, which is the million-dollar door.\n\nSo, in this case, one points to the million-dollar door and the other to the death door. That's not helpful.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe my initial approach is the most straightforward.\n\nTo summarize, I should ask either robot, \"Which door would the other robot suggest I take?\", and then choose the opposite door. This ensures that regardless of whether I'm asking the truth-teller or the liar, I will be directed away from the death door and towards the million-dollar door.\n\nI think this is the solution to the puzzle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Ask either robot, \"Which door would the other robot suggest I take?\", and choose the opposite door.}} \\]"
