The equation given is:\n\n(8 - 2)^2 + 4(3x - 7) = 18\n\nFirst, I'll simplify the expression inside the parentheses and the exponent.\n\nStep 1: Calculate (8 - 2)\n\n8 - 2 = 6\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n6^2 + 4(3x - 7) = 18\n\nStep 2: Calculate 6 squared\n\n6^2 = 36\n\nNow the equation is:\n\n36 + 4(3x - 7) = 18\n\nStep 3: Distribute the 4 across the terms inside the parentheses\n\n4 * 3x = 12x\n\n4 * (-7) = -28\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n36 + 12x - 28 = 18\n\nStep 4: Combine like terms\n\n36 - 28 = 8\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n8 + 12x = 18\n\nStep 5: Isolate the term with x\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n8 + 12x - 8 = 18 - 8\n\n12x = 10\n\nStep 6: Solve for x\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\nx = 10 / 12\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nx = 5 / 6\n\nSo, the solution is x = 5/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}} \\]"
