        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a family with five children, and we're given some relationships between their ages and the sum of their ages. Let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's assign variables to each child's age to make it easier to work with. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the age of the youngest child.\n\n- The oldest child is twice as old as the youngest, so the oldest is \\( 2y \\).\n\n- The second oldest is half the age of the oldest, so that would be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2y = y \\).\n\n- The third oldest is one year younger than the second oldest, so \\( y - 1 \\).\n\n- The fourth oldest is two years older than the youngest, so \\( y + 2 \\).\n\nNow, we know the sum of all their ages is 30. So, we can write an equation:\n\n\\[ 2y + y + (y - 1) + (y + 2) + y = 30 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, combine like terms:\n\n\\[ 2y + y + y - 1 + y + 2 + y = 30 \\]\n\nWait, let me check that again. I think I missed something. Let's list out each term again:\n\n- Oldest: \\( 2y \\)\n\n- Second oldest: \\( y \\)\n\n- Third oldest: \\( y - 1 \\)\n\n- Fourth oldest: \\( y + 2 \\)\n\n- Youngest: \\( y \\)\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n\\[ 2y + y + (y - 1) + (y + 2) + y = 30 \\]\n\nNow, combine the \\( y \\) terms:\n\n\\[ 2y + y + y + y + y = 6y \\]\n\nAnd the constants:\n\n\\[ -1 + 2 = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 6y + 1 = 30 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 6y = 29 \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29 is not divisible by 6. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let's try again.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Oldest: \\( 2y \\)\n\n- Second oldest: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2y = y \\)\n\n- Third oldest: \\( y - 1 \\)\n\n- Fourth oldest: \\( y + 2 \\)\n\n- Youngest: \\( y \\)\n\nWait a minute, the youngest is \\( y \\), and the fourth oldest is \\( y + 2 \\), which is older than the youngest, as expected. But let's verify if the ordering makes sense.\n\nThe ages from oldest to youngest should be:\n\n1. Oldest: \\( 2y \\)\n\n2. Second oldest: \\( y \\)\n\n3. Third oldest: \\( y - 1 \\)\n\n4. Fourth oldest: \\( y + 2 \\)\n\n5. Youngest: \\( y \\)\n\nWait, here I see a potential issue. The fourth oldest is \\( y + 2 \\), which is older than the youngest \\( y \\), but it's listed as the fourth oldest. Meanwhile, the second oldest is \\( y \\), which is the same as the youngest, which doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, there's a problem here. If the second oldest is \\( y \\), and the youngest is also \\( y \\), but the fourth oldest is \\( y + 2 \\), which is greater than \\( y \\), that would mean the ages are:\n\n1. \\( 2y \\)\n\n2. \\( y \\)\n\n3. \\( y - 1 \\)\n\n4. \\( y + 2 \\)\n\n5. \\( y \\)\n\nBut this ordering seems inconsistent because the fourth oldest should be greater than the third oldest and the youngest. Let's try to arrange them in descending order to see if it makes sense.\n\nAssuming \\( y \\) is positive, let's assume \\( y = 1 \\) for testing:\n\n- Oldest: 2\n\n- Second oldest: 1\n\n- Third oldest: 0 (which can't be, since age can't be zero if y=1)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to reconsider the relationships.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"In a family of 5 children, the oldest child is twice as old as the youngest. The second oldest child is half the age of the oldest, and the third oldest is one year younger than the second oldest. The fourth oldest is two years older than the youngest. How old is the youngest child if the sum of all their ages is 30?\"\n\nAlright, let's try redefining the variables or perhaps approaching it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the ages in order from oldest to youngest:\n\n- Oldest: \\( o \\)\n\n- Second oldest: \\( s \\)\n\n- Third oldest: \\( t \\)\n\n- Fourth oldest: \\( f \\)\n\n- Youngest: \\( y \\)\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\n1. \\( o = 2y \\) (oldest is twice as old as youngest)\n\n2. \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} o \\) (second oldest is half the age of the oldest)\n\n3. \\( t = s - 1 \\) (third oldest is one year younger than the second oldest)\n\n4. \\( f = y + 2 \\) (fourth oldest is two years older than the youngest)\n\n5. \\( o + s + t + f + y = 30 \\) (sum of ages is 30)\n\nNow, let's express all variables in terms of \\( y \\):\n\nFrom 1: \\( o = 2y \\)\n\nFrom 2: \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} o = \\frac{1}{2} (2y) = y \\)\n\nFrom 3: \\( t = s - 1 = y - 1 \\)\n\nFrom 4: \\( f = y + 2 \\)\n\nFrom 5: \\( o + s + t + f + y = 30 \\)\n\nSubstitute the expressions in terms of \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 2y + y + (y - 1) + (y + 2) + y = 30 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 2y + y + y - 1 + y + 2 + y = 30 \\)\n\nWait, let's count the \\( y \\)'s:\n\n- 2y (oldest)\n\n- y (second oldest)\n\n- y - 1 (third oldest)\n\n- y + 2 (fourth oldest)\n\n- y (youngest)\n\nSo, total: \\( 2y + y + y - 1 + y + 2 + y = 6y + 1 = 30 \\)\n\nWait, but earlier I had \\( 6y + 1 = 30 \\), which gives \\( 6y = 29 \\), but 29 is not divisible by 6, which suggests a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the mistake is in the relationships. Let me double-check the problem statement.\n\n\"the second oldest child is half the age of the oldest\"\n\n\"the third oldest is one year younger than the second oldest\"\n\n\"the fourth oldest is two years older than the youngest\"\n\n\"the sum of all their ages is 30\"\n\nHmm, maybe the issue is in interpreting \"the second oldest child is half the age of the oldest.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second oldest is half the age of the oldest, which is consistent with \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} o \\), and since \\( o = 2y \\), then \\( s = y \\), which seems fine.\n\nWait, perhaps the third oldest being one year younger than the second oldest is causing the issue.\n\nIf \\( t = s - 1 = y - 1 \\), and if \\( y = 1 \\), then \\( t = 0 \\), which is not possible.\n\nMaybe the ages can't be less than 1, so \\( y \\) must be at least 1, and \\( t = y - 1 \\) must be at least 0, which is possible only if \\( y \\geq 1 \\).\n\nBut mathematically, \\( y \\) must satisfy \\( 6y + 1 = 30 \\), which gives \\( y = \\frac{29}{6} \\), which is approximately 4.833, which is not an integer.\n\nWait, maybe ages aren't integers. Let's consider that possibility.\n\nSo, \\( y = \\frac{29}{6} \\), approximately 4.833 years old.\n\nThen, let's check the other ages:\n\n- Oldest: \\( 2y = \\frac{58}{6} = 9.\\overline{6} \\)\n\n- Second oldest: \\( y = 4.\\overline{8} \\)\n\n- Third oldest: \\( y - 1 = 3.\\overline{8} \\)\n\n- Fourth oldest: \\( y + 2 = 6.\\overline{8} \\)\n\n- Youngest: \\( y = 4.\\overline{8} \\)\n\nNow, sum: \\( 9.\\overline{6} + 4.\\overline{8} + 3.\\overline{8} + 6.\\overline{8} + 4.\\overline{8} \\)\n\nLet's add them up:\n\nFirst, add the integer parts: 9 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 26\n\nNow, the decimal parts: 0.\\overline{6} + 0.\\overline{8} + 0.\\overline{8} + 0.\\overline{8} + 0.\\overline{8}\n\nConvert to fractions:\n\n0.\\overline{6} = 2/3\n\n0.\\overline{8} = 8/9\n\nSo, total decimal part: 2/3 + 4*(8/9) = 2/3 + 32/9 = (6/9 + 32/9) = 38/9 \u2248 4.\\overline{2}\n\nAdd to integer parts: 26 + 4.\\overline{2} = 30.\\overline{2}\n\nBut the sum should be 30, not 30.\\overline{2}. This suggests an error in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the relationships between the ages are misinterpreted.\n\nLet me try rephrasing the relationships.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Oldest is twice the youngest: \\( o = 2y \\)\n\n- Second oldest is half the oldest: \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} o = y \\)\n\n- Third oldest is one year younger than the second oldest: \\( t = s - 1 = y - 1 \\)\n\n- Fourth oldest is two years older than the youngest: \\( f = y + 2 \\)\n\n- Sum of ages: \\( o + s + t + f + y = 30 \\)\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\( 2y + y + (y - 1) + (y + 2) + y = 30 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 2y + y + y - 1 + y + 2 + y = 30 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 6y + 1 = 30 \\)\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n\\( 6y = 29 \\)\n\nDivide by 6:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{29}{6} \\)\n\nBut this doesn't yield an integer, which might be undesirable for ages, but mathematically it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the \"second oldest\" relationship.\n\nLet me consider that \"the second oldest child is half the age of the oldest.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the second oldest child is half the age of the oldest\" means \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} o \\), which is consistent with above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a misinterpretation of the age relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third oldest being one year younger than the second oldest doesn't hold, or perhaps there's a different way to interpret \"the third oldest.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"the third oldest is one year younger than the second oldest\" should be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the third oldest is one year younger than the second oldest\" means \\( t = s - 1 \\), which is what I had.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fourth oldest being two years older than the youngest is causing the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the children are ordered is confusing.\n\nLet me try to list the ages in descending order:\n\n1. Oldest: \\( o = 2y \\)\n\n2. Second oldest: \\( s = y \\)\n\n3. Third oldest: \\( t = y - 1 \\)\n\n4. Fourth oldest: \\( f = y + 2 \\)\n\n5. Youngest: \\( y \\)\n\nWait a minute, in this ordering, the fourth oldest is \\( y + 2 \\), which is greater than the second oldest \\( y \\), but in the list, it's placed after the third oldest \\( y - 1 \\). This seems inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the ordering is not correct. Maybe we need to arrange the ages in descending order properly.\n\nLet's consider that the oldest is \\( 2y \\), and the second oldest is \\( y \\), then the third oldest is \\( y - 1 \\), the fourth oldest is \\( y + 2 \\), and the youngest is \\( y \\).\n\nBut in this case, the fourth oldest should be between the third oldest and the youngest in age, but \\( y + 2 > y \\), which is fine, but \\( y + 2 > y - 1 \\), which is also fine.\n\nWait, but in the list, the fourth oldest should be greater than the third oldest and less than the second oldest.\n\nBut in this case, \\( y + 2 > y \\), but if \\( y + 2 > y \\), that's fine, but in the list, it's placed after the third oldest, which is \\( y - 1 \\).\n\nMaybe the issue is in the way we're ordering the children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are not compatible, leading to no solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the ages must be positive integers.\n\nAssuming ages are positive integers, \\( y \\) must be at least 1.\n\nFrom \\( y = \\frac{29}{6} \\), which is approximately 4.833, which is not an integer, this suggests no solution exists under integer ages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for non-integer ages.\n\nIn that case, the youngest is \\( \\frac{29}{6} \\) years old.\n\nBut it's unusual to have non-integer ages in such problems, so maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships between the ages are misinterpreted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of 30 is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret \"the second oldest is half the age of the oldest.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the second oldest is half the age of the oldest\" means \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} o \\), which is what I had.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider assigning variables differently.\n\nLet me try letting the youngest be \\( y \\), as before, but perhaps approach the problem differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assigning the oldest as \\( o \\), then youngest is \\( \\frac{o}{2} \\), second oldest is \\( \\frac{o}{2} \\), third oldest is \\( \\frac{o}{2} - 1 \\), fourth oldest is \\( \\frac{o}{2} + 2 \\), and youngest is \\( \\frac{o}{2} \\).\n\nWait, that seems similar to what I did before.\n\nSum would be \\( o + \\frac{o}{2} + (\\frac{o}{2} - 1) + (\\frac{o}{2} + 2) + \\frac{o}{2} = 30 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( o + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} - 1 + \\frac{o}{2} + 2 + \\frac{o}{2} = 30 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( o + 2*\\frac{o}{2} + 2*\\frac{o}{2} + 1 = 30 \\)\n\nWait, simplify differently:\n\n\\( o + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} - 1 + \\frac{o}{2} + 2 + \\frac{o}{2} = 30 \\)\n\nCombine \\( o \\) terms:\n\n\\( o + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} = o + 2*\\frac{o}{2} + 2*\\frac{o}{2} = o + o + o = 3o \\)\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, \\( o + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} - 1 + \\frac{o}{2} + 2 + \\frac{o}{2} \\)\n\nCombine \\( o \\) terms:\n\n\\( o + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} = o + 2*\\frac{o}{2} + 2*\\frac{o}{2} = o + o + o = 3o \\)\n\nWait, no. \\( o + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} = o + 2*\\frac{o}{2} + 2*\\frac{o}{2} = o + o + o = 3o \\)\n\nBut that seems incorrect because \\( o + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} + \\frac{o}{2} = o + 2*\\frac{o}{2} + 2*\\frac{o}{2} = o + o + o = 3o \\), which is correct.\n\nNow, constants: \\( -1 + 2 = 1 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 3o + 1 = 30 \\)\n\nThus, \\( 3o = 29 \\), so \\( o = \\frac{29}{3} \\), which is approximately 9.\\overline{6}.\n\nThen, \\( y = \\frac{o}{2} = \\frac{29}{6} \\), which matches previous result.\n\nThis suggests that the youngest is \\( \\frac{29}{6} \\) years old.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solve this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using simultaneous equations.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Oldest: \\( o \\)\n\n- Second oldest: \\( s \\)\n\n- Third oldest: \\( t \\)\n\n- Fourth oldest: \\( f \\)\n\n- Youngest: \\( y \\)\n\nGiven:\n\n1. \\( o = 2y \\)\n\n2. \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} o \\)\n\n3. \\( t = s - 1 \\)\n\n4. \\( f = y + 2 \\)\n\n5. \\( o + s + t + f + y = 30 \\)\n\nSubstitute 1 into 2: \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} (2y) = y \\)\n\nThen, substitute into 3: \\( t = y - 1 \\)\n\nSubstitute into 4: \\( f = y + 2 \\)\n\nSubstitute all into 5:\n\n\\( 2y + y + (y - 1) + (y + 2) + y = 30 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 2y + y + y - 1 + y + 2 + y = 30 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 6y + 1 = 30 \\)\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n\\( 6y = 29 \\)\n\nDivide by 6:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{29}{6} \\)\n\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the youngest child is \\( \\frac{29}{6} \\) years old, which is approximately 4.833 years.\n\nAlternatively, in mixed number format, that's \\( 4 \\frac{5}{6} \\) years old.\n\nSo, the answer is \\( \\boxed{\\dfrac{29}{6}} \\) years old."
