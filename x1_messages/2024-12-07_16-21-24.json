        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 units of product A and 300 units of product B each day. Each unit of product A takes 2 hours to produce, and each unit of product B takes 3 hours. I need to find out the total hours of labor required per day for both products.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total hours for product A. Since each unit of A takes 2 hours and they produce 200 units, I can multiply 200 by 2. That should give me the total hours for A.\n\n200 units * 2 hours/unit = 400 hours\n\nNext, for product B, each unit takes 3 hours, and they produce 300 units. So, 300 units * 3 hours/unit should give me the total hours for B.\n\n300 units * 3 hours/unit = 900 hours\n\nNow, to find the total hours for both products, I just need to add the hours for A and B together.\n\n400 hours + 900 hours = 1300 hours\n\nSo, the factory requires 1300 hours of labor per day to produce all units of both products.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with product A: 200 units * 2 hours/unit = 400 hours. That seems correct.\n\nProduct B: 300 units * 3 hours/unit = 900 hours. That also seems right.\n\nAdding them up: 400 + 900 = 1300 hours. Yeah, that appears to be the total.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The question is straightforward: it's just about calculating the total labor hours based on the number of units produced and the time required per unit.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1300} \\]"
