        "content": "One unique adaptation that whales have developed to survive in their ocean environment is their ability to hold their breath for extended periods of time. Some species, like the sperm whale, can hold their breath for up to 90 minutes while diving deep into the ocean to hunt for food. This is made possible by their large lungs and efficient oxygen utilization, which allows them to conserve oxygen and minimize the frequency of surfacing for air. This adaptation enables whales to efficiently feed and thrive in their aquatic habitat."
