        "content": "As of my last update in early 2023, the most awarded song in Grammy's history released after 1990 is \"Baby One More Time\" by Britney Spears. However, it's essential to note that the Grammys have evolved significantly over the years, and the number of awards a song receives can vary based on changes in categories and voting trends.\n\n\"Baby One More Time,\" released in 1998, won in multiple categories, including Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The song's success at the Grammys was a significant milestone for Spears' career and helped establish her as a major pop star.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that other songs released after 1990 have also received numerous Grammy awards. For example, \"Hotel California\" by the Eagles, though released in 1976, has won several awards over the years, but since it was released before 1990, it doesn't fit the criteria of your question.\n\nAnother noteworthy mention is \"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna, released in 1989, which also received multiple Grammy nominations and wins. However, since it was released before 1990, it's not considered in this context.\n\nIn summary, \"Baby One More Time\" by Britney Spears holds the record for the most awarded song in Grammy's history released after 1990, with wins in categories such as Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\n\n**Note:** Grammy awards are subject to change with each annual ceremony, so it's possible that a more recent song has surpassed this record since my last update. For the most current information, I recommend checking the latest Grammy award results."
