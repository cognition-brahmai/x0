        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are four people: Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave, each with a different favorite color: red, green, blue, or yellow. They're sitting at a round table, so positions are relative to each other.\n\nFirst fact: The person who likes red is sitting opposite the person who likes green. That means red and green are directly across from each other at the table.\n\nSecond fact: Alice is sitting to the left of the person who likes blue. So, if we imagine seating positions clockwise, Alice is on the left of the blue lover.\n\nThird fact: Bob is sitting to the right of the person who likes yellow. Again, thinking clockwise, Bob is on the right of the yellow lover.\n\nFourth fact: Carol does not like red.\n\nAlright, let's try to map this out. Since it's a round table with four people, each person has someone directly opposite them.\n\nLet's assign positions. Let's say position 1, position 2, position 3, and position 4, arranged in a circle.\n\nLet's assume position 1 is Alice, position 2 is Bob, position 3 is Carol, and position 4 is Dave. But I need to remember that the actual seating might be different.\n\nFirst, the person who likes red is opposite the person who likes green. So, if red is at position 1, green is at position 3, and vice versa.\n\nSecond, Alice is to the left of the person who likes blue. So, if Alice is at position 1, the person to her right (position 2) likes blue.\n\nWait, but in a clockwise arrangement, left would be counter-clockwise. So, if Alice is at position 1, the person to her left would be position 4, and to her right would be position 2.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to clarify. If we're sitting around a table, and we define left and right based on each person's perspective, then:\n\n- To Alice's left is position 4.\n\n- To Alice's right is position 2.\n\nSo, if Alice is sitting to the left of the person who likes blue, that means the person to Alice's left likes blue. So, position 4 likes blue.\n\nWait, but position 4 is Dave, so Dave likes blue.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is sitting to the right of the person who likes yellow. So, if Bob is at position 2, the person to his left is position 1, who is Alice, and she likes yellow.\n\nWait, no. If Bob is at position 2, and he is to the right of the person who likes yellow, that means the person to his left likes yellow.\n\nSo, position 1 likes yellow.\n\nBut position 1 is Alice, so Alice likes yellow.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought position 4 likes blue, which is Dave.\n\nSo, Alice likes yellow, Dave likes blue.\n\nNow, the person who likes red is opposite the person who likes green.\n\nIf Alice is at position 1 and likes yellow, and Dave at position 4 likes blue, then positions 2 and 3 are Bob and Carol.\n\nIf Alice is at position 1, then position 3 is opposite position 1.\n\nSo, position 3 would be opposite Alice.\n\nBut Alice likes yellow, which is not red or green, so position 3 could be either red or green.\n\nBut wait, Carol is at position 3, and Carol does not like red.\n\nSo, Carol at position 3 likes green.\n\nThen, the person opposite Carol, which is position 1, likes red, but Alice likes yellow, so that can't be.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nLet's denote the positions as North, East, South, West for simplicity.\n\n- North: Person A\n\n- East: Person B\n\n- South: Person C\n\n- West: Person D\n\nOpposites are North-South and East-West.\n\nFirst fact: Red is opposite green.\n\nSo, either Red is North and Green is South, or Red is East and Green is West.\n\nSecond fact: Alice is to the left of the person who likes blue.\n\nIf we consider left from Alice's perspective, her left would be counter-clockwise.\n\nSo, if Alice is at North, her left is West.\n\nSimilarly, if Alice is at East, her left is North, and so on.\n\nThird fact: Bob is to the right of the person who likes yellow.\n\nRight is clockwise.\n\nSo, if Bob is at East, his right is South.\n\nFourth fact: Carol does not like red.\n\nThis seems too vague to start with, so maybe I should consider the positions.\n\nLet me try assigning positions step by step.\n\nFirst, red and green are opposite each other.\n\nLet's assume red is at North and green is at South.\n\nNow, Alice is sitting to the left of the person who likes blue.\n\nIf Alice is at North, her left is West.\n\nSo, the person at West likes blue.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is sitting to the right of the person who likes yellow.\n\nIf Bob is at East, his right is South.\n\nSo, the person at South likes yellow.\n\nBut in this setup, South likes green, but now South likes yellow. That's a conflict.\n\nWait, in this setup, South likes green, but if South also likes yellow, that's impossible.\n\nSo, maybe red is at South and green is at North.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nRed at South, green at North.\n\nNow, Alice is to the left of the person who likes blue.\n\nIf Alice is at North (green), her left is West.\n\nSo, the person at West likes blue.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is to the right of the person who likes yellow.\n\nIf Bob is at East, his right is South.\n\nSo, the person at South likes yellow.\n\nBut South is red, which is already assigned.\n\nConflict again.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that Alice is not at North.\n\nLet's try placing Alice elsewhere.\n\nLet's assume Alice is at West.\n\nThen, her left is South.\n\nSo, the person at South likes blue.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is to the right of the person who likes yellow.\n\nIf Bob is at North, his right is East.\n\nSo, the person at East likes yellow.\n\nNow, red and green are opposite each other.\n\nIf South is blue, North is green (assuming red is at East and green at West, but West is Alice, who doesn't like red.\n\nWait, Carol doesn't like red, but Alice might.\n\nWait, Carol doesn't like red, but maybe Alice does.\n\nWait, fourth fact says Carol does not like red.\n\nSo, Carol cannot like red.\n\nIf Alice is at West, and South is blue, North is green, East is yellow.\n\nBut red and green are opposite, so if green is at North, red must be at South, but South is blue.\n\nConflict again.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should make a table.\n\nLet's list the positions and possibilities.\n\nPositions: 1,2,3,4 around the table.\n\nFirst, red and green are opposite each other.\n\nSo, if red is at position 1, green is at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, if red is at 2, green is at 4, and so on.\n\nSecond, Alice is to the left of the person who likes blue.\n\nSo, Alice's left neighbor likes blue.\n\nThird, Bob is to the right of the person who likes yellow.\n\nSo, Bob's right neighbor likes yellow.\n\nFourth, Carol does not like red.\n\nLet's consider the possible seatings.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Position 1: Alice\n\n- Position 2: Bob\n\n- Position 3: Carol\n\n- Position 4: Dave\n\nNow, red and green are opposite each other.\n\nSo, if red is at 1, green is at 3.\n\nOr red at 2, green at 4.\n\nAlice is at 1, and her left is position 4 (Dave likes blue).\n\nBob is at 2, and his right is position 3 (Carol likes yellow).\n\nBut Carol doesn't like red, which is consistent if red is at 1 or 2.\n\nNow, if red is at 1, green is at 3.\n\nAlice is at 1 (yellow), Carol is at 3 (green), Dave at 4 (blue), Bob at 2 (red).\n\nBut Bob cannot like red because red is at 2, and Bob is at 2.\n\nWait, no: Bob is at 2, and red is at 2, so Bob likes red.\n\nBut in this setup, Carol is at 3 and likes green, Dave at 4 likes blue, Alice at 1 likes yellow.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nWait, but Bob is at 2, and he is to the right of the person who likes yellow.\n\nThe person to his left is Alice, who likes yellow.\n\nThat's consistent.\n\nSo, this seems to work.\n\nOption 2:\n\nAlternatively, red at 2, green at 4.\n\nAlice at 1, left is 4 (Dave likes blue).\n\nBob at 2, right is 3 (Carol likes yellow).\n\nThen, Alice at 1 likes yellow, Dave at 4 likes blue, Bob at 2 likes red, Carol at 3 likes green.\n\nThis also seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in both options, Alice likes yellow, Dave likes blue, Bob likes red, Carol likes green.\n\nIs there a conflict?\n\nIn the first option, Bob is at position 2 and likes red.\n\nIn the second option, Bob is at position 2 and likes red.\n\nSimilarly, Alice is at position 1 and likes yellow.\n\nDave is at position 4 and likes blue.\n\nCarol is at position 3 and likes green.\n\nAnd red and green are opposite each other.\n\nIn both possible seatings, the assignments work.\n\nBut perhaps there's only one unique solution.\n\nWait, but in both options, the assignments are the same.\n\nSo, everyone's favorite color is:\n\n- Alice: yellow\n\n- Bob: red\n\n- Carol: green\n\n- Dave: blue\n\nAnd they are seated such that red and green are opposite each other.\n\nThis seems to satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet me check:\n\n1. Red and green are opposite each other: yes, Bob (red) and Carol (green).\n\n2. Alice is to the left of the person who likes blue: Alice is to the left of Dave, who likes blue.\n\n3. Bob is to the right of the person who likes yellow: Bob is to the right of Alice, who likes yellow.\n\n4. Carol does not like red: correct, she likes green.\n\nSo, this seems to be the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice: yellow, Bob: red, Carol: green, Dave: blue}} \\]"
