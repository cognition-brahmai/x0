        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city is planning to build a network of bicycle lanes covering 150 miles, and the construction budget for this project is $15 million. We need to calculate the average cost per mile for building these bike lanes and also determine how many intersections will require upgrades to accommodate the new infrastructure, assuming there are four intersections per mile on average.\n\nFirst, to find the average cost per mile, we'll divide the total construction budget by the total miles of bike lanes. So, that's $15 million divided by 150 miles.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nAverage cost per mile = Total construction budget / Total miles\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nAverage cost per mile = $15,000,000 / 150 miles\n\nNow, doing the math:\n\n$15,000,000 \u00f7 150 = $100,000 per mile\n\nSo, the average cost per mile for building the bike lanes is $100,000.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many intersections will require upgrades. We're told that there are four intersections per mile on average. So, to find the total number of intersections that will require upgrades, we'll multiply the total miles by the average number of intersections per mile.\n\nLet me express that:\n\nTotal intersections = Total miles \u00d7 Average intersections per mile\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal intersections = 150 miles \u00d7 4 intersections per mile\n\nCalculating that:\n\n150 \u00d7 4 = 600 intersections\n\nTherefore, 600 intersections will require upgrades to accommodate the new bike lane infrastructure.\n\nJust to double-check, let's make sure the units make sense. We have miles and intersections per mile, so multiplying them should give us the total number of intersections, which makes sense. And for the cost, dividing the total budget by the total miles gives us the cost per mile, which is what we need.\n\nAlso, it's worth considering if there are any additional costs or factors that might affect these calculations, but based on the information provided, this seems straightforward. We're not given any other variables like differing costs per mile or varying numbers of intersections, so we'll assume that the averages provided are sufficient for this calculation.\n\nSo, in summary, the average cost per mile for building the bike lanes is $100,000, and 600 intersections will require upgrades.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100000 \\text{ dollars per mile and } 600 \\text{ intersections}} \\]"
