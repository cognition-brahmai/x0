It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how quicksort works:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot**: Select a pivot element from the array. This can be any element in the array, but common choices are the first element, the last element, or the middle element.\n\n2. **Partition the array**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final sorted position.\n\n3. **Recursively sort the sub-arrays**: Apply the above steps recursively to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and to the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python. I'll provide a simple version of quicksort that sorts a list of integers in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]  # Choose the middle element as pivot\n        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n        middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n        return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_list = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\n    print(\"Original list:\", example_list)\n    sorted_list = quicksort(example_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the code:\n\n1. **Base case**: If the array has one or no elements, it's already sorted, so we return it as is.\n\n2. **Choosing the pivot**: Here, we choose the middle element as the pivot to try to avoid worst-case performance.\n\n3. **Partitioning**: We create three lists:\n   - `left`: elements less than the pivot\n   - `middle`: elements equal to the pivot\n   - `right`: elements greater than the pivot\n\n4. **Recursive sorting**: We recursively sort the `left` and `right` lists and concatenate the results with the `middle` list to get the final sorted list.\n\nThis implementation is concise and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for learning about quicksort.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
