        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The garden is 20 meters long and 15 meters wide. I need to find out two things: first, what's the area of the garden as it is, and second, what would the area be if both the length and the width were increased by 50%.\n\nOkay, starting with the first part. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for this garden, that would be 20 meters times 15 meters. Let me do that multiplication: 20 times 15 is 300 square meters. So, the current area of the garden is 300 square meters.\n\nNow, for the second part, I need to increase both the length and the width by 50%. Increasing a dimension by 50% means making it one and a half times its original size, right? Because 100% is the original size, and 50% is half of that, so together it's 150%, or 1.5 times the original.\n\nSo, the new length would be 20 meters times 1.5, which is 30 meters. And the new width would be 15 meters times 1.5, which is 22.5 meters.\n\nNow, to find the new area, I multiply the new length by the new width: 30 meters times 22.5 meters. Let's see, 30 times 20 is 600, and 30 times 2.5 is 75, so total area would be 600 plus 75, which is 675 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. Original area is 20 times 15, which is 300 square meters. New dimensions are 30 meters by 22.5 meters, which is 30 times 22.5.\n\nLet me calculate it differently. 30 times 20 is 600, and 30 times 2.5 is 75, so yes, 600 plus 75 is 675 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage increase. If both dimensions are increased by 50%, the area should increase by more than 50%, because area is a two-dimensional measurement.\n\nLet's see, increasing each dimension by 50% means the area increases by (1.5 times 1.5), which is 2.25 times the original area.\n\nSo, original area is 300 square meters, multiplied by 2.25 should give us the new area.\n\n300 times 2 is 600, and 300 times 0.25 is 75, so 600 plus 75 is indeed 675 square meters.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. The new area would be 675 square meters.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Original area: 20m * 15m = 300 sq.m\n\n- New dimensions: length = 20m * 1.5 = 30m; width = 15m * 1.5 = 22.5m\n\n- New area: 30m * 22.5m = 675 sq.m\n\nAlternatively, using the percentage increase directly: original area * (1.5 * 1.5) = 300 * 2.25 = 675 sq.m\n\nEither way, the answer is consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\boxed{300} square meters, and the new area after increasing both dimensions by 50% is \\boxed{675} square meters."
