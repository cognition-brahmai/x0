        "content": "So I have this question here: If I read at an average speed of 250 words per minute, how long will it take me to read a 400-page book with 300 words per page? Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of words in the book. Since there are 400 pages and each page has 300 words, I can multiply those two numbers to get the total word count. So, 400 pages times 300 words per page equals... let's see, 400 times 300. Well, 4 times 3 is 12, and there are four zeros in total (two from 400 and two from 300), so that would be 12 followed by four zeros, which is 120,000 words. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I read at a speed of 250 words per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take to read 120,000 words, I need to divide the total number of words by my reading speed. So, 120,000 words divided by 250 words per minute. Let's do that division. 120,000 divided by 250.\n\nWell, 250 times 400 is 100,000, because 250 times 4 is 1,000, and then times 100 is 100,000. Then, 120,000 minus 100,000 is 20,000. Now, 250 times 80 is 20,000, because 250 times 8 is 2,000, and times 10 is 20,000. So, 400 plus 80 is 480 minutes.\n\nWait, does that sound right? Let me double-check. 250 times 480 equals... 250 times 400 is 100,000, plus 250 times 80 is 20,000, which totals 120,000 words. Yes, that checks out.\n\nNow, 480 minutes is a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to convert that into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 480 divided by 60 equals 8 hours. So, it would take me 8 hours to read the entire book at my average reading speed.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Like, maybe reading fatigue or the fact that I might not read continuously for 8 hours. Hmm, the question doesn't mention any breaks or reading sessions, so I think assuming continuous reading is fine for this calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find out how many days it would take if I read, say, an hour a day, I could do that. But again, the question is specifically asking for the time in minutes or hours, not days.\n\nLet me just verify my calculations once more to be sure. Total words: 400 pages times 300 words per page equals 120,000 words. Reading speed: 250 words per minute. Time required: 120,000 divided by 250 equals 480 minutes. Convert to hours: 480 divided by 60 equals 8 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 480 minutes, or 8 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480 \\text{ minutes} \\text{ or } 8 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
