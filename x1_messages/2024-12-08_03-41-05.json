        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, the hospital wants to expand its emergency department by 75%. Currently, there are 50 beds.\n\nTo find the increase in beds, I'll calculate 75% of 50:\n\n75% of 50 = 0.75 * 50 = 37.5\n\nSince we can't have half a bed, we'll round this to 38 beds.\n\nSo, the new capacity will be:\n\n50 beds + 38 beds = 88 beds\n\nNow, they want to maintain a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:4. That means for every 4 patients, there needs to be one nurse.\n\nWith 88 beds, the number of nurses required would be:\n\n88 patients / 4 = 22 nurses\n\nBut wait, this is the total number of nurses needed at any given time. However, since the hospital operates 24/7 with three 8-hour shifts, we need to figure out how many nurses are needed per shift.\n\nAssuming the patient load is relatively constant throughout the day, we can divide the total number of nurses by the number of shifts.\n\nNumber of shifts per day = 3\n\nSo, nurses per shift = 22 nurses / 3 shifts \u2248 7.33 nurses per shift\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a nurse, we'll need to round up to 8 nurses per shift.\n\nBut, to confirm, let's check the total number of nurses needed with this arrangement:\n\n8 nurses per shift * 3 shifts = 24 nurses\n\nBut earlier, we calculated that 22 nurses are needed for 88 patients at a 1:4 ratio. So, with 24 nurses, the ratio would be even better.\n\nAlternatively, if we assign 8 nurses per shift, total nurses needed would be 24. But perhaps some nurses work longer shifts or there's overlap, so we might not need 24 distinct nurses.\n\nWait, actually, since nurses work in shifts, the total number of nurses needed would be equal to the number of shifts multiplied by the number of nurses per shift, assuming no overlapping shifts and nurses only work one shift.\n\nBut in reality, nurses might work multiple shifts, and there may be some overlap.\n\nTo simplify, let's assume that each nurse works one 8-hour shift per day.\n\nTherefore, the total number of nurses needed would be 8 nurses per shift * 3 shifts = 24 nurses.\n\nNow, the hospital is expanding from 50 beds to 88 beds, which is an increase of 38 beds.\n\nWe need to find out how many additional nurses are required.\n\nFirst, find the current number of nurses needed for 50 beds at a 1:4 ratio.\n\n50 patients / 4 = 12.5 nurses\n\nRounding up to 13 nurses total.\n\nCurrently, assuming the hospital maintains the 1:4 ratio, they have 13 nurses.\n\nWith the expansion, they need 22 nurses.\n\nTherefore, additional nurses needed = 22 - 13 = 9 nurses.\n\nBut earlier, with shifts, we had 24 nurses total.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nIf the hospital currently has 50 beds and needs a 1:4 nurse-to-patient ratio, then:\n\n50 / 4 = 12.5 \u2248 13 nurses total.\n\nBut with three 8-hour shifts, the number of nurses per shift would be:\n\n13 nurses / 3 shifts \u2248 4.33 nurses per shift.\n\nBut this seems low, considering that with 50 beds, spread over three shifts, the patient load per shift might be different.\n\nMaybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider that the hospital operates 24/7 with three 8-hour shifts.\n\nAssuming that the patient load is distributed relatively evenly across shifts, then each shift would have approximately one-third of the total patients.\n\nSo, for 88 beds:\n\nPatients per shift = 88 / 3 \u2248 29.33 patients per shift\n\nThen, for each shift, nurses needed = 29.33 patients / 4 = 7.33 nurses per shift\n\nRounding up to 8 nurses per shift.\n\nTotal nurses needed = 8 nurses per shift * 3 shifts = 24 nurses\n\nCurrently, with 50 beds:\n\nPatients per shift = 50 / 3 \u2248 16.67 patients per shift\n\nNurses needed per shift = 16.67 / 4 \u2248 4.17 \u2248 5 nurses per shift\n\nTotal nurses currently needed = 5 nurses per shift * 3 shifts = 15 nurses\n\nTherefore, additional nurses needed = 24 - 15 = 9 nurses\n\nWait, earlier I had calculated differently.\n\nLet me verify.\n\nCurrent nurses: 15\n\nNeeded nurses: 24\n\nAdditional nurses: 9\n\nBut wait, with 50 beds, 50/4=12.5\u224813 nurses total, not 15.\n\nMaybe I'm double-counting.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf the hospital has 50 beds and a 1:4 ratio, they need 13 nurses total.\n\nThese 13 nurses are spread over three shifts.\n\nSo, nurses per shift = 13 / 3 \u2248 4.33 \u2248 5 nurses per shift\n\nSimilarly, with 88 beds, needs 22 nurses total.\n\n22 / 3 \u2248 7.33 \u2248 8 nurses per shift\n\nTotal nurses needed: 8 per shift * 3 shifts = 24 nurses\n\nAdditional nurses needed: 24 - 13 = 11 nurses\n\nWait, now I have two different numbers: 9 and 11.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me see.\n\nWith 50 beds:\n\nTotal nurses needed: 13\n\nWith 88 beds:\n\nTotal nurses needed: 22\n\nBut if they have three shifts, does that mean they need 22 nurses per shift?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of full-time equivalents (FTE).\n\nIn healthcare, nurse staffing is often calculated using FTEs.\n\nAn FTE is equivalent to one nurse working full-time, which is usually 40 hours per week.\n\nBut in this hospital, nurses work three 8-hour shifts, which is 24 hours.\n\nWait, but typically, a full-time nurse works five 8-hour shifts per week, totaling 40 hours.\n\nBut here, with three 8-hour shifts per day, it's 24 hours covered.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the weekly hours.\n\nLet's assume a nurse works five 8-hour shifts per week, totaling 40 hours.\n\nSo, one FTE = 40 hours per week.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total nurse-hours needed per week for the current and expanded capacities.\n\nFirst, for 50 beds:\n\nNurses needed: 13 total\n\nAssuming they work five 8-hour shifts per week:\n\nTotal nurse-hours per week = 13 nurses * 40 hours/week = 520 hours/week\n\nSimilarly, for 88 beds:\n\nNurses needed: 22 total\n\nTotal nurse-hours per week = 22 nurses * 40 hours/week = 880 hours/week\n\nTherefore, additional nurse-hours needed per week = 880 - 520 = 360 hours/week\n\nNow, to find out how many additional FTEs are needed:\n\nAdditional FTEs = additional nurse-hours per week / hours per FTE per week\n\nAdditional FTEs = 360 / 40 = 9 FTEs\n\nSo, the hospital needs to hire 9 additional full-time nurses.\n\nNow, the next part is to estimate the annual salary cost for these additional nursing staff, given an average salary of $70,000 per year.\n\nAnnual salary cost = number of additional nurses * average salary per nurse\n\nAnnual salary cost = 9 nurses * $70,000/nurse = $630,000 per year\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to budget an additional $630,000 per year for the salaries of the new nursing staff.\n\nBut wait, earlier I had some confusion between different methods leading to different numbers. Let's double-check.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCalculate the increase in beds: 50 beds * 75% = 37.5 \u2248 38 beds\n\nNew total beds: 50 + 38 = 88 beds\n\nNurses needed for new capacity: 88 / 4 = 22 nurses\n\nCurrent nurses: 50 / 4 = 12.5 \u2248 13 nurses\n\nAdditional nurses needed: 22 - 13 = 9 nurses\n\nAnnual salary cost: 9 * $70,000 = $630,000\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to hire 9 additional nurses, costing an additional $630,000 per year.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, do all nurses work full-time, or is there a mix of full-time and part-time staff?\n\nIf some nurses work part-time, the calculation would be more complex.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we're assuming that the additional nurses will be full-time employees.\n\nAlso, we're not considering benefits or other employment costs beyond the base salary.\n\nIn reality, employment costs include not only salary but also benefits, taxes, and other expenses.\n\nBut since the question specifies to consider only the average salary of $70,000 per year, we'll stick to that.\n\nAnother consideration is that nurse staffing needs might vary depending on the acuity of patients or other factors, but again, based on the information provided, we're using a standard 1:4 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the hospital needs to hire 9 additional nurses, with an annual salary cost of $630,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9 \\text{ additional nurses, costing an additional } \\$630,000 \\text{ per year}} \\]"
