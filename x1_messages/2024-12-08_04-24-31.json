        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains traveling towards each other from City A to City B and vice versa. One takes 4 hours, the other takes 6 hours to cover the same distance. They start at the same time, and we need to find out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the speeds of these trains. Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is D kilometers.\n\nThe first train takes 4 hours to cover D kilometers, so its speed is D/4 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe second train takes 6 hours to cover the same D kilometers, so its speed is D/6 kilometers per hour.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, relative speed = (D/4 + D/6) km/h.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12. So,\n\nD/4 = (3D)/12\n\nD/6 = (2D)/12\n\nTherefore, relative speed = (3D + 2D)/12 = 5D/12 km/h.\n\nNow, since they start at the same time from City A and City B, the distance between them initially is D kilometers.\n\nThe time it takes for them to meet can be found by dividing the initial distance by their relative speed.\n\nSo, time = D / (5D/12) = D * (12)/(5D) = 12/5 hours.\n\n12/5 hours is the same as 2 hours and 24 minutes (since 0.4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 24 minutes).\n\nTherefore, they will meet 2 hours and 24 minutes after they start their journeys.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?\n\nLet's consider the speeds again. Train A: D/4 km/h, Train B: D/6 km/h.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time until they meet as T hours.\n\nIn T hours, Train A will cover a distance of (D/4)*T kilometers.\n\nIn the same T hours, Train B will cover (D/6)*T kilometers.\n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should equal the initial distance between them, which is D kilometers.\n\nSo, (D/4)*T + (D/6)*T = D\n\nFactor out T: T*(D/4 + D/6) = D\n\nWe can divide both sides by D (assuming D \u2260 0):\n\nT*(1/4 + 1/6) = 1\n\nFind a common denominator for 4 and 6, which is 12:\n\nT*(3/12 + 2/12) = 1\n\nT*(5/12) = 1\n\nTherefore, T = 12/5 hours, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, the answer is indeed 12/5 hours, or 2 hours and 24 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of ratios.\n\nThe speeds are D/4 and D/6, so the ratio of their speeds is (D/4)/(D/6) = 6/4 = 3/2.\n\nThis means Train A is faster than Train B by a ratio of 3:2.\n\nThe time taken for them to meet should be proportional to their speeds.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is to consider the concept of relative speed directly.\n\nYes, since they are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which we already calculated as 5D/12 km/h.\n\nTime to meet is total distance divided by relative speed, which again gives us T = D / (5D/12) = 12/5 hours.\n\nSeems consistent across different approaches.\n\nIs there a way to solve this without assuming the distance D?\n\nActually, yes. We can set the distance between City A and City B as a variable, say D, and proceed as above.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume a specific value for D to simplify calculations, but since D cancels out in the equations, it's not necessary.\n\nHowever, for clarity, perhaps assuming D = 12 km (a multiple of 4 and 6) might simplify the numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nLet D = 12 km.\n\nThen, Train A's speed = 12/4 = 3 km/h.\n\nTrain B's speed = 12/6 = 2 km/h.\n\nRelative speed = 3 + 2 = 5 km/h.\n\nTime to meet = 12 / 5 = 2.4 hours, which is 2 hours and 24 minutes.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method or whether we assume a specific value for D, the time they take to meet is 12/5 hours or 2 hours and 24 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the two trains will meet 2 hours and 24 minutes after they start their journeys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours and } 24 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
