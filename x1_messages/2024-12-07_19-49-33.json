How does one explain the inexplicable? How does one justify the unjustifiable? Yet, here I am, attempting to do just that, for you deserve nothing less than the truth, even if it is a truth that will cause you pain.\n\nI must tell you something, something that may seem like the stuff of fantasy, but I assure you, it is real, as real as the love I have for you. I am not who you think I am. I am not bound by time as you and I once were. I am a traveler, a wanderer through the epochs, and soon, I must embark on another journey, leaving you behind.\n\nI know this sounds like the ravings of a madman, but please, hear me out. Our love, it is not just a flame that burns in this moment; it is a star that shines across the vast expanse of time itself. But even stars must sometimes be alone in the cosmos, their light traveling through the void, reaching out to those they cannot touch.\n\nI have seen things, my love, things that would make your mind reel. I have walked among the ancients, witnessed the birth of civilizations, and felt the pulse of the earth as it shifted and changed over millennia. And in all of this, you have been my constant, my anchor in the ever-flowing river of time.\n\nBut now, duty calls again. There are events unfolding in eras long past and future that require my attention. I am needed elsewhere, in other times, to ensure that the tapestry of history remains intact, that the threads do not fray and tear under the weight of unseen forces.\n\nLeaving you is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, perhaps the only thing harder than facing the unknown dangers that lie ahead. But I must go, for I am not just a man in love; I am a guardian of time, and with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nPromise me that you will live your life to the fullest, that you will find happiness and fulfillment in all that you do. Do not dwell on my absence, for though I may be physically gone, I will always be with you in spirit, watching over you, loving you from afar.\n\nOne day, perhaps, when my duties are done, when the sands of time have settled once more, I may return to you. Until then, keep the flame of our love burning bright, for it is the light that guides me through the darkest of times.\n\nForever yours,\n\n[Your Name]"
