]day, and it works 6 days a week. There are 4 weeks in a month. I need to find out how many units it produces in a month.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in a week. Since it makes 250 units each day and works 6 days a week, I can multiply 250 by 6.\n\n250 units/day * 6 days/week = 1500 units/week\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 1500 units each week.\n\nNow, there are 4 weeks in a month, so to find the monthly production, I can multiply the weekly production by 4.\n\n1500 units/week * 4 weeks/month = 6000 units/month\n\nSo, the factory produces 6000 units in a month.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total number of days the factory works in a month and then multiply that by the daily production.\n\nSince it works 6 days a week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of days in a month is:\n\n6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month\n\nThen, multiplying the number of days by the daily production:\n\n24 days/month * 250 units/day = 6000 units/month\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think that's correct. The factory produces 6000 units in a month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
