        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people consisting of engineers, doctors, and teachers. The relationships between their numbers are given as follows:\n\n1. There are twice as many engineers as doctors.\n\n2. There are three times as many teachers as engineers.\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible size of this group.\n\nFirst, let's assign variables to make this easier. Let's denote:\n\n- Let \\( D \\) represent the number of doctors.\n\n- Then, since there are twice as many engineers as doctors, the number of engineers \\( E \\) would be \\( 2D \\).\n\n- Next, there are three times as many teachers as engineers, so the number of teachers \\( T \\) would be \\( 3E \\), which is \\( 3 \\times 2D = 6D \\).\n\nNow, the total size of the group \\( G \\) would be the sum of doctors, engineers, and teachers:\n\n\\[ G = D + E + T = D + 2D + 6D = 9D \\]\n\nSo, the total group size is \\( 9D \\).\n\nNow, to find the smallest possible size of the group, we need to consider the smallest possible positive integer value for \\( D \\), since having zero doctors wouldn't make sense in this context.\n\nThe smallest positive integer is 1. So, let's set \\( D = 1 \\):\n\n- Doctors: \\( D = 1 \\)\n\n- Engineers: \\( E = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n\n- Teachers: \\( T = 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n\n- Total group size: \\( G = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 \\)\n\nWait a minute, is 1 a possible number of doctors? Let's think about it. In reality, a group consisting of only 1 doctor, 2 engineers, and 6 teachers totals 9 people. But is there a smaller group that satisfies the same ratios?\n\nLet's consider if \\( D \\) could be a fraction. For example, if \\( D = 0.5 \\):\n\n- Doctors: \\( 0.5 \\)\n\n- Engineers: \\( 2 \\times 0.5 = 1 \\)\n\n- Teachers: \\( 6 \\times 0.5 = 3 \\)\n\n- Total: \\( 0.5 + 1 + 3 = 4.5 \\)\n\nBut having half a doctor doesn't make sense in reality, as you can't have half a person. So, \\( D \\) should be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible group size is when \\( D = 1 \\), giving a total of 9 people.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's a way to have a smaller group that still maintains these ratios.\n\nSuppose we try \\( D = 0 \\):\n\n- Doctors: 0\n\n- Engineers: \\( 2 \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n\n- Teachers: \\( 6 \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n\n- Total: 0\n\nBut a group with zero people doesn't make sense in this context, as there has to be at least one person.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps there's a greatest common divisor (GCD) that can be factored out to make the group smaller, but given the relationships, it seems that 9 is the minimal size when \\( D = 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the relationships, but the problem is pretty straightforward.\n\nSo, I think the smallest possible size of the group is 9 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
