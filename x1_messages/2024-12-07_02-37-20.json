        "content": "To determine the selling price that achieves a 25% profit margin on a product with a production cost of $80 per unit, we need to understand the relationship between cost, profit, and selling price.\n\nFirst, let's define what a profit margin is. A profit margin is the percentage of the selling price that is profit. In this case, a 25% profit margin means that 25% of the selling price is profit, and the remaining 75% covers the cost of production.\n\nLet's denote the selling price as \\( P \\), and the cost of production as \\( C = \\$80 \\).\n\nGiven that the profit margin is 25%, we can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = P - C = 0.25P\n\\]\n\nThis equation states that the profit, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost, is equal to 25% of the selling price.\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\nP - C = 0.25P \\\\\nP - 0.25P = C \\\\\n0.75P = C \\\\\nP = \\frac{C}{0.75} \\\\\nP = \\frac{80}{0.75} \\\\\nP = \\$106.\\overline{6}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the selling price should be approximately \\$106.67 per unit to achieve a 25% profit margin.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there's another way to interpret profit margin, sometimes referred to as the profit margin on cost, where the profit is 25% of the cost, not of the selling price. Let's explore this alternative interpretation as well.\n\nIf the profit is 25% of the cost, then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = 0.25 \\times C = 0.25 \\times 80 = \\$20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the selling price would be:\n\n\\[\nP = C + \\text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = \\$100\n\\]\n\nSo, depending on whether the profit margin is interpreted as a percentage of the selling price or a percentage of the cost, we get different selling prices: approximately \\$106.67 versus \\$100.\n\nTo clarify which interpretation is correct, we need to understand the specific definition of profit margin being used by the company. In many business contexts, profit margin refers to the percentage of the selling price that is profit, which aligns with the first calculation. However, in some cases, especially in cost accounting, profit margin might refer to the profit as a percentage of the cost.\n\nGiven the potential for confusion, it's crucial for the company to specify which profit margin definition they are using. Assuming the standard interpretation where profit margin is the profit as a percentage of the selling price, the selling price should be approximately \\$106.67 per unit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{106.\\overline{6}} \\]"
