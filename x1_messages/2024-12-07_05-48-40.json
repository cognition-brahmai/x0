        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 8 red balls and 12 blue balls, making a total of 20 balls. We're supposed to pick three balls without replacement, and we need to find the probability that exactly two of them are red.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for probability. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where exactly two red balls are picked, and the total possible outcomes are all possible ways to pick three balls from the box.\n\nSo, let's start by finding the total number of ways to pick three balls from 20. This is a combination problem because the order in which we pick the balls doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose three balls from 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20!}{3!(20 - 3)!} = \\frac{20!}{3! \\times 17!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 17! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17!}{3! \\times 17!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 19 = 380 \\\\\n380 \\times 18 = 6840\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n\\[\n6840 \\div 6 = 1140\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 1,140 possible ways to choose three balls from 20.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to pick exactly two red balls and one blue ball.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to pick two red balls from the eight available. Again, this is a combination problem:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying by canceling out the \\( 6! \\):\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2!}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 2! = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to choose two red balls from eight.\n\nNow, we need to choose one blue ball from the twelve available. The number of ways to do this is:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 1) = \\frac{12!}{1!(12 - 1)!} = \\frac{12!}{1! \\times 11!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 1) = \\frac{12 \\times 11!}{1 \\times 11!} = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 12 ways to choose one blue ball from twelve.\n\nTo find the total number of favorable outcomes, we multiply the number of ways to choose two red balls by the number of ways to choose one blue ball:\n\n\\[\n28 \\times 12 = 336\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 336 favorable ways to pick exactly two red balls and one blue ball.\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly two red}) = \\frac{336}{1140}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 12:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{336 \\div 12}{1140 \\div 12} = \\frac{28}{95}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of picking exactly two red balls is \\( \\frac{28}{95} \\).\n\nAlternatively, we can convert this to a decimal to get a sense of it:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{28}{95} \\approx 0.2947\n\\]\n\nWhich is approximately 29.47%.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\( \\frac{28}{95} \\) or about 29.47%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{28}{95}} \\]"
