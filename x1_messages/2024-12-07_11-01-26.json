        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 5 cats and 7 dogs in a room, and we need to figure out how many of those dogs have 3 legs based on the total number of legs being 47.\n\nFirst, let's establish what we know for sure:\n\n1. There are 5 cats, and each cat has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs from the cats is 5 cats * 4 legs/cat = 20 legs.\n\n2. There are 7 dogs, and each dog has either 3 or 4 legs. We don't know how many of each, but we can assign variables to represent this.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of dogs with 3 legs.\n\n- Let y be the number of dogs with 4 legs.\n\nWe know that the total number of dogs is 7, so:\n\nx + y = 7  ...(equation 1)\n\nWe also know that the total number of legs from the dogs is the sum of the legs from the dogs with 3 legs and the dogs with 4 legs. So:\n\n3x + 4y  legs from the dogs.\n\nBut we also know that the total number of legs in the room is 47, which includes both cats and dogs. Since the cats contribute 20 legs, the dogs must contribute the remaining legs.\n\nSo, total legs from dogs = 47 - 20 = 27 legs.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n3x + 4y = 27  ...(equation 2)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. x + y = 7\n\n2. 3x + 4y = 27\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of x and y.\n\nLet's solve equation 1 for y:\n\ny = 7 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into equation 2:\n\n3x + 4(7 - x) = 27\n\nExpand the equation:\n\n3x + 28 - 4x = 27\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-1x + 28 = 27\n\nNow, subtract 28 from both sides:\n\n-1x = -1\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to solve for x:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, there is 1 dog with 3 legs.\n\nTo find y, plug x back into equation 1:\n\ny = 7 - 1 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 dogs with 4 legs.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it adds up.\n\nTotal legs from cats: 5 cats * 4 legs = 20 legs\n\nTotal legs from dogs: (1 dog * 3 legs) + (6 dogs * 4 legs) = 3 + 24 = 27 legs\n\nTotal legs in the room: 20 + 27 = 47 legs, which matches the given total.\n\nSo, the answer is that there is 1 dog with 3 legs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
