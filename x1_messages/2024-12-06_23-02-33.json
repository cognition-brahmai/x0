        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, so total balls are 5 + 3 = 8. I need to find the probability that both balls drawn are red, and it says I put the first ball back before drawing the second one. So, that means the draws are independent, right?\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of drawing a red ball in one draw. Since there are 5 red balls out of 8 total balls, the probability of drawing a red ball is 5/8.\n\nNow, because I'm putting the ball back, the total number of balls remains the same for the second draw, and the probability of drawing a red ball again is still 5/8.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event since they are independent.\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being red is (5/8) * (5/8) = 25/64.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I understand this correctly. The first draw is 5/8, and since I replace the ball, the second draw is also 5/8. Multiplying them gives 25/64.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using combinations or something, but since the draws are with replacement, the formula I used should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw and a red ball on the second draw. Since these are independent events, multiplying their probabilities makes sense.\n\nLet me check if there's any other factor to consider. The problem says I note the color and put it back, so the probabilities remain constant for each draw.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 25/64 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
