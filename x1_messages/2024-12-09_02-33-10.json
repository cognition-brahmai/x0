        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to build a command-line application in TypeScript that interacts with a Kubernetes cluster. The app should let users list all running pods, get detailed info about a specific pod, and delete a pod by its name. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a TypeScript project. I'm familiar with Node.js, so I'll use that as the runtime. I should start by initializing a new Node project and installing the necessary dependencies.\n\nLet me think about the dependencies I'll need. Since I need to interact with a Kubernetes cluster, I'll probably use the Kubernetes JavaScript client library. I recall there's a package called `@kubernetes/client-node` that should do the trick. I'll need to install that.\n\nAlso, since I'm writing in TypeScript, I'll need to have TypeScript installed and set up a `tsconfig.json` file to compile my code.\n\nAlright, so step one: set up the project structure and install dependencies.\n\nI'll create a new directory for my project, say `kube-cli`, and navigate into it.\n\nThen, run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file with default values.\n\nNext, install the necessary packages:\n\n- `typescript` for compiling TypeScript code.\n\n- `@kubernetes/client-node` for interacting with the Kubernetes API.\n\n- `yargs` or `commander` for parsing command-line arguments. I think I'll go with `commander` because it's straightforward and widely used.\n\n- Maybe `chalk` for adding some color to the console output, makes it look nicer.\n\nSo, running:\n\n```\n\nnpm install typescript @kubernetes/client-node commander chalk\n\n```\n\nAlso, I need to initialize TypeScript in the project. I can do this by running:\n\n```\n\nnpx tsc --init\n\n```\n\nThis will create a `tsconfig.json` file with default settings. I might need to adjust some settings later, but for now, this should suffice.\n\nNow, I need to set up my project structure. I'll have an `src` directory where I'll place all my TypeScript files, and an `out` directory where the compiled JavaScript will be placed.\n\nSo, my project structure looks like this:\n\n- `kube-cli/`\n\n- `src/`\n\n- `index.ts`\n\n- `pod.ts`\n\n- `utils.ts`\n\n- `package.json`\n\n- `tsconfig.json`\n\n- `out/` (this will be generated)\n\nI'll place the main entry point in `src/index.ts`, and have separate files for handling pod operations and any utility functions.\n\nLet me think about how the application will work. I need to allow users to perform three operations:\n\n1. List all running pods.\n\n2. Get detailed information about a specific pod.\n\n3. Delete a pod by its name.\n\nI should design the command-line interface in a way that's intuitive and follows common conventions. Using `commander` will help me achieve that.\n\nI'll create a CLI with subcommands for each operation. For example:\n\n- `kube-cli pods list`\n\n- `kube-cli pods get <pod-name>`\n\n- `kube-cli pods delete <pod-name>`\n\nThis seems clean and organized.\n\nNow, before diving into writing code, I need to figure out how to set up the Kubernetes client in TypeScript. I've used the Python Kubernetes client before, but not the JavaScript one.\n\nLooking at the documentation for `@kubernetes/client-node`, it seems straightforward. I need to create a `KubernetesClient` instance and set up the authentication and configuration.\n\nKubernetes typically uses service accounts for in-cluster authentication, and for local development, it uses the Kubernetes config file (~/.kube/config). I need to make sure my application can handle both scenarios.\n\nI should check if the code is running inside a Kubernetes cluster or locally and configure the client accordingly.\n\nIn-cluster configuration can be set up using:\n\n```\n\nconst k8s = require('@kubernetes/client-node');\n\nconst kubeConfig = new k8s.KubeConfig();\n\nkubeConfig.loadInCluster();\n\n```\n\nFor out-of-cluster configuration:\n\n```\n\nconst kubeConfig = new k8s.KubeConfig();\n\nkubeConfig.loadFromDefault();\n\n```\n\nI need to handle both cases to make the application versatile.\n\nAlright, moving forward, I need to implement the pod-related operations.\n\nFirst, listing all running pods. To do this, I need to query the Kubernetes API for pods in a specific namespace, probably default, unless specified otherwise.\n\nI should also allow the user to specify the namespace via a command-line option.\n\nSimilarly, getting detailed information about a specific pod would involve fetching the pod object by name in the specified namespace.\n\nDeleting a pod would involve sending a deletion request for the specified pod in the namespace.\n\nI need to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful messages to the user.\n\nAlso, since we're dealing with asynchronous operations (API calls), I need to make sure to use async/await properly to handle promises.\n\nLet me sketch out the basic structure of the code.\n\nIn `src/pod.ts`, I'll have functions for each operation:\n\n- `listPods(namespace: string): Promise<Pod[]>`\n\n- `getPod(namespace: string, podName: string): Promise<Pod>`\n\n- `deletePod(namespace: string, podName: string): Promise<void>`\n\nI need to define what a `Pod` looks like. Probably, I can use the types provided by `@kubernetes/client-node`.\n\nWait, looking at the documentation, `@kubernetes/client-node` provides a `CoreV1Api` class that has methods for interacting with pods.\n\nSo, I need to create an instance of `CoreV1Api` and use its methods.\n\nFor example, to list pods:\n\n```\n\nconst coreV1Api = kubeConfig.makeApiClient(k8s.CoreV1Api);\n\nconst pods = await coreV1Api.listNamespacedPod(namespace);\n\n```\n\nSimilarly, for getting a specific pod:\n\n```\n\nconst pod = await coreV1Api.readNamespacedPod(podName, namespace);\n\n```\n\nAnd for deleting a pod:\n\n```\n\nawait coreV1Api.deleteNamespacedPod(podName, namespace);\n\n```\n\nI need to handle cases where the pod doesn't exist or other errors occur.\n\nNow, for the CLI part, I'll use `commander`. I need to set up commands for `pods list`, `pods get`, and `pods delete`, each accepting necessary options like namespace and pod name.\n\nI should also consider adding options like output format for listing pods, maybe JSON or table format.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll start with basic text output.\n\nLet me think about the command structure.\n\nThe main command will be `kube-cli`, and the subcommand will be `pods`, followed by the specific operation.\n\nSo, the commands would look like:\n\n- `kube-cli pods list [--namespace=<namespace>]`\n\n- `kube-cli pods get <pod-name> [--namespace=<namespace>]`\n\n- `kube-cli pods delete <pod-name> [--namespace=<namespace>]`\n\nI need to make sure that the namespace is optional and defaults to \"default\" if not specified.\n\nAlso, I should validate that the required arguments are provided, like pod name for get and delete operations.\n\nIn `src/index.ts`, I'll set up the commander commands and link them to the corresponding functions in `src/pod.ts`.\n\nI should also handle any global options, like verbose mode or output format, if needed.\n\nNow, about authentication and configuration. I need to make the application detect whether it's running inside a Kubernetes cluster or locally and configure the Kubernetes client accordingly.\n\nI can check for the presence of service account tokens or the kube config file to determine the environment.\n\nLooking at the `@kubernetes/client-node` documentation, it seems that `KubeConfig` class has methods to load configuration appropriately.\n\nSpecifically, `kubeConfig.loadFromDefault()` should handle both in-cluster and out-of-cluster configurations correctly.\n\nSo, I can use that.\n\nI need to make sure that when running inside a cluster, the service account has the necessary permissions to list, get, and delete pods.\n\nI might need to create a ClusterRole and RoleBinding for the service account if I deploy this application inside a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the configuration is set up correctly.\n\nMoving on, I need to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the Kubernetes API is unreachable, or if the user doesn't have permission to perform an action, I should display a user-friendly error message.\n\nI can use try-catch blocks around the API calls and log any errors using console.error.\n\nAlso, for the list operation, I need to format the pod information in a readable way.\n\nPerhaps show columns like NAME, STATUS, NODE, START TIME, etc.\n\nI can use the `table` package to generate a nice table output, but to keep dependencies minimal, I'll just format it as plain text for now.\n\nSimilarly, for getting detailed information about a pod, I can print out various fields like status, containers, events, etc.\n\nBut again, to keep it simple, I'll just log the JSON representation for now.\n\nDeleting a pod should confirm with the user before proceeding, maybe with a --force option to skip confirmation.\n\nWait, actually, deleting resources is dangerous, so I should always prompt for confirmation unless --force is specified.\n\nThis is similar to how `kubectl delete` works.\n\nI need to handle that carefully to prevent accidental deletions.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan.\n\nLet me start by setting up the TypeScript files.\n\nFirst, `src/utils.ts` for any utility functions.\n\nNot sure yet, but maybe for formatting output or handling confirmations.\n\nThen, `src/pod.ts` for pod-related operations.\n\nAnd `src/index.ts` for setting up the CLI with commander.\n\nLet me start with `src/pod.ts`.\n\nI need to import the necessary modules from `@kubernetes/client-node`.\n\nAlso, since I'm using TypeScript, I need to make sure that the types are imported correctly.\n\nLooking at the package, it seems to have type definitions included, so that should be fine.\n\nHere's a rough structure for `src/pod.ts`:\n\n```\n\nimport * as k8s from '@kubernetes/client-node';\n\nexport async function listPods(namespace: string): Promise<k8s.V1Pod[]> {\n\n const kubeConfig = new k8s.KubeConfig();\n\n kubeConfig.loadFromDefault();\n\n const coreV1Api = kubeConfig.makeApiClient(k8s.CoreV1Api);\n\n const res = await coreV1Api.listNamespacedPod(namespace);\n\n return res.body.items;\n\n}\n\nexport async function getPod(namespace: string, podName: string): Promise<k8s.V1Pod> {\n\n const kubeConfig = new k8s.KubeConfig();\n\n kubeConfig.loadFromDefault();\n\n const coreV1Api = kubeConfig.makeApiClient(k8s.CoreV1Api);\n\n const res = await coreV1Api.readNamespacedPod(podName, namespace);\n\n return res.body;\n\n}\n\nexport async function deletePod(namespace: string, podName: string): Promise<void> {\n\n const kubeConfig = new k8s.KubeConfig();\n\n kubeConfig.loadFromDefault();\n\n const coreV1Api = kubeConfig.makeApiClient(k8s.CoreV1Api);\n\n await coreV1Api.deleteNamespacedPod(podName, namespace);\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is a basic implementation. I need to handle errors in each function, though.\n\nFor example, if the pod doesn't exist, `readNamespacedPod` will throw an error.\n\nI should catch those errors and provide meaningful messages.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the Kubernetes client is properly configured and authenticated.\n\nI might need to handle cases where the config is missing or invalid.\n\nBut for now, this is a starting point.\n\nNext, in `src/index.ts`, I'll set up the commander commands.\n\nFirst, install `commander` and `chalk`:\n\n```\n\nnpm install commander chalk\n\n```\n\nThen, in `src/index.ts`:\n\n```\n\nimport { Command } from 'commander';\n\nimport * as pod from './pod';\n\nimport chalk from 'chalk';\n\nconst program = new Command();\n\nprogram\n\n .name('kube-cli')\n\n .description('A CLI to interact with Kubernetes pods')\n\n .version('0.1.0');\n\n// Pods subcommand\n\nconst pods = program.command('pods <command>');\n\npods\n\n .description('Manage pods')\n\n .option('-n, --namespace <namespace>', 'Kubernetes namespace', 'default')\n\n ;\n\n// List pods\n\npods\n\n .command('list')\n\n .description('List all running pods')\n\n .action(async (options: { namespace: string }) => {\n\n try {\n\n const pods = await pod.listPods(options.namespace);\n\n // Print pods\n\n pods.forEach(p => {\n\n console.log(p.metadata.name);\n\n });\n\n } catch (err) {\n\n console.error(chalk.red('Error listing pods:'), err.message);\n\n }\n\n });\n\n// Get pod\n\npods\n\n .command('get <podName>')\n\n .description('Get details of a specific pod')\n\n .action(async (podName: string, options: { namespace: string }) => {\n\n try {\n\n const podInfo = await pod.getPod(options.namespace, podName);\n\n console.log(JSON.stringify(podInfo, null, 2));\n\n } catch (err) {\n\n console.error(chalk.red('Error getting pod:'), err.message);\n\n }\n\n });\n\n// Delete pod\n\npods\n\n .command('delete <podName>')\n\n .description('Delete a pod')\n\n .option('--force', 'Force deletion without confirmation')\n\n .action(async (podName: string, options: { namespace: string; force: boolean }) => {\n\n if (!options.force) {\n\n const confirm = await confirmDeletion();\n\n if (!confirm) {\n\n console.log('Deletion aborted.');\n\n return;\n\n }\n\n }\n\n try {\n\n await pod.deletePod(options.namespace, podName);\n\n console.log(`Pod ${podName} deleted.`);\n\n } catch (err) {\n\n console.error(chalk.red('Error deleting pod:'), err.message);\n\n }\n\n });\n\nasync function confirmDeletion(): Promise<boolean> {\n\n const readline = require('readline').createInterface({\n\n input: process.stdin,\n\n output: process.stdout\n\n });\n\n return new Promise((resolve) => {\n\n readline.question('Are you sure you want to delete the pod? (y/N): ', (answer) => {\n\n const response = answer.trim().toLowerCase();\n\n resolve(response === 'y' || response === 'yes');\n\n readline.close();\n\n });\n\n });\n\n}\n\nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n\n```\n\nThis sets up the basic structure for the CLI.\n\nI've defined subcommands for `list`, `get`, and `delete` under the `pods` command.\n\nEach subcommand calls the corresponding function from `pod.ts` and handles errors using try-catch.\n\nFor deleting a pod, I've added a confirmation prompt unless the `--force` option is specified.\n\nI've also used `chalk` to colorize error messages for better visibility.\n\nNow, I need to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and make sure it runs correctly.\n\nIn `package.json`, I'll add scripts for compiling and running the application.\n\n```\n\n\"scripts\": {\n\n \"build\": \"tsc\",\n\n \"start\": \"node out/index.js\"\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI need to make sure that the compiled JavaScript is placed in the `out` directory.\n\nIn `tsconfig.json`, I can set the `outDir` property to `\"out\"`.\n\nNow, to test the application, I'll need to have a Kubernetes cluster running and accessible.\n\nI can use Minikube or a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster like GKE or EKS.\n\nMake sure that the kube config is set up correctly.\n\nOnce the cluster is set up, I can run the commands to list, get, and delete pods.\n\nI should also test the error handling, like trying to get or delete a non-existent pod.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that the application behaves correctly when running inside a Kubernetes cluster, using in-cluster configuration.\n\nI can test that by deploying the application as a pod in the cluster and verifying that it can list, get, and delete pods.\n\nWait, but I need to containerize the application first.\n\nHmm, maybe that's a step for later.\n\nFor now, I'll focus on getting the CLI working locally.\n\nAlright, I think this is a good starting point.\n\nI'll proceed to implement the functions in `pod.ts` and handle any errors that might occur.\n\nI should also think about how to format the output for the list operation to make it more user-friendly.\n\nMaybe list pods in a tabular format with columns for name, status, node, and start time.\n\nI can look into using a library like `cli-table` or `string-table` to generate tables.\n\nAlternatively, I can manually format the output using console.log and string manipulation.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll go with manual formatting for now.\n\nLet me update the `listPods` function in `src/index.ts` to print a table-like output.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\n\nNAME \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 STATUS \u00a0 \u00a0NODE \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 START TIME\n\npod1 \u00a0 \u00a0Running \u00a0 node1 \u00a0 2022-01-01 12:00:00\n\npod2 \u00a0 \u00a0Pending \u00a0 node2 \u00a0 2022-01-01 12:05:00\n\n```\n\nI can calculate the maximum width for each column and align the text accordingly.\n\nThis will require some string manipulation, but it's doable.\n\nI'll implement that in the `listPods` action.\n\nAlso, for the `getPod` command, instead of logging the raw JSON, I can extract and display specific fields in a readable format.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Name\n\n- Namespace\n\n- Status\n\n- Node\n\n- IP\n\n- Containers and their statuses\n\n- Events\n\nThis will require parsing the pod object and extracting the relevant information.\n\nAgain, for now, I'll keep it simple and log the JSON, but I'll note that this needs improvement.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the main aspects of the task.\n\nI'll proceed to implement the functions, handle errors, and refine the output formatting.\n\nOnce that's done, I can test the application with a local Kubernetes cluster and make sure it works as expected.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo build a command-line application in TypeScript that interacts with a Kubernetes cluster, allowing users to list all running pods, get detailed information about a specific pod, and delete a pod by its name, follow these steps:\n\n### Project Setup\n\n1. **Initialize the project:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir kube-cli\n   cd kube-cli\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n2. **Install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   npm install typescript @kubernetes/client-node commander chalk\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize TypeScript:**\n   ```bash\n   npx tsc --init\n   ```\n\n4. **Set up the directory structure:**\n   ```\n   kube-cli/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.ts\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pod.ts\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils.ts\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tsconfig.json\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 out/  #
