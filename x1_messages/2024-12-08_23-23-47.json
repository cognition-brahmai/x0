        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that sells two products, A and B. The profit from each unit of A is $25, and from each unit of B is $40. In one month, they sold a total of 200 units of both products and made a total profit of $6,500. We need to find out how many units of each product were sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should define variables for the number of units sold for each product. Let's say:\n\n- Let x be the number of units of product A sold.\n\n- Let y be the number of units of product B sold.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the total units sold are 200. So, we can write the first equation as:\n\nx + y = 200\n\nNext, the total profit from these sales is $6,500. Since each unit of A brings in $25 and each unit of B brings in $40, we can write the second equation as:\n\n25x + 40y = 6500\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) x + y = 200\n\n2) 25x + 40y = 6500\n\nI think the best way to solve this is by using the substitution or elimination method. Maybe I'll try the substitution method first.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can express x in terms of y:\n\nx = 200 - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into equation 2:\n\n25(200 - y) + 40y = 6500\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n25*200 - 25y + 40y = 6500\n\n5000 - 25y + 40y = 6500\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n5000 + 15y = 6500\n\nNext, subtract 5000 from both sides:\n\n15y = 1500\n\nNow, divide both sides by 15:\n\ny = 100\n\nSo, 100 units of product B were sold.\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 200 - y = 200 - 100 = 100\n\nTherefore, 100 units of product A were sold, and 100 units of product B were sold.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. If they sold 100 units of A at $25 each, that's 100*25 = $2,500. For product B, 100 units at $40 each is 100*40 = $4,000. Adding these up, 2,500 + 4,000 = $6,500, which matches the total profit given. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try another method to confirm. Let's try the elimination method.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1) x + y = 200\n\n2) 25x + 40y = 6500\n\nI can try to eliminate one of the variables. Maybe I'll try to eliminate x.\n\nFirst, multiply equation 1 by 25:\n\n25x + 25y = 5000\n\nNow, subtract this from equation 2:\n\n(25x + 40y) - (25x + 25y) = 6500 - 5000\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n15y = 1500\n\nThen, y = 100, just like before.\n\nNow, substitute y back into equation 1:\n\nx + 100 = 200\n\nSo, x = 100\n\nAgain, we get the same result. Seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using ratios or something else, but I think the system of equations is the most straightforward method here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem. The problem states that there are two products, A and B, with profits of $25 and $40 per unit, respectively. Total units sold are 200, and total profit is $6,500. We're assuming that these are the only two products sold, and there are no other factors affecting the profit.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider markup or other costs since the problem directly gives the profit per unit. So, our approach should be correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the average profit per unit. Total profit is $6,500 for 200 units, so average profit per unit is 6500 / 200 = $32.50 per unit.\n\nNow, product A has a profit of $25, and product B has $40. So, the average being $32.50 suggests that the number of units of A and B are equal, because $32.50 is right in the middle of $25 and $40. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me calculate the weighted average. If we have equal units of A and B, then the average profit would be (25 + 40)/2 = 65/2 = $32.50, which matches our earlier calculation. So, indeed, having equal units of A and B would give us the average profit per unit as $32.50.\n\nTherefore, selling 100 units of A and 100 units of B would result in the total profit of $6,500, which matches the given information.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of units were different, the average would shift accordingly. But in this case, since it's right in the middle, it makes sense that equal units were sold.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider if more of product B were sold, which has a higher profit per unit. If more B were sold, the average profit per unit would be higher than $32.50. But in this problem, it's exactly $32.50, suggesting equal units of A and B.\n\nSimilarly, if more A were sold, the average would be lower than $32.50. Again, since it's $32.50, it supports the conclusion that equal units were sold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 100 units of product A and 100 units of product B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ units of product A and } 100 \\text{ units of product B}} \\]"
