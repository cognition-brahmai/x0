        "content": "To find the volume of a cylindrical container, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 4 inches and the height (h) is 10 inches, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0*(4 inches)\u00b2*(10 inches) = \u03c0*(16 square inches)*(10 inches) = \u03c0*(160 cubic inches).\n\nSince \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the volume as:\n\nV \u2248 3.14159 * 160 cubic inches \u2248 502.65 cubic inches.\n\nSo, the volume of the container is approximately 502.65 cubic inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{502.65} \\]"
