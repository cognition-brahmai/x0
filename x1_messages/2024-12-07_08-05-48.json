        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company has two parts to their charging scheme: a flat fee per day and an additional charge per mile driven. The flat fee is $20 per day, and the additional charge is $0.15 per mile.\n\nFirst, the customer rents the car for 5 days. So, the cost for the days rented would be the flat fee multiplied by the number of days. That is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost for days} = 20 \\, \\text{USD/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nNext, the customer drives the car for 400 miles. The cost for the miles driven would be the per-mile charge multiplied by the number of miles:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost for miles} = 0.15 \\, \\text{USD/mile} \\times 400 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total charge, we need to add these two amounts together:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total charge} = \\text{Cost for days} + \\text{Cost for miles} \\]\n\nLet's calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost for the days:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the cost for the miles:\n\n\\[ 0.15 \\times 400 = 60 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\nNow, add these two amounts to get the total charge:\n\n\\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount the customer will be charged is $160.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
