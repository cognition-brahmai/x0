        "content": "Let's see... There are 10 houses in a row, and every day the delivery moves one house to the right. So, if House 1 gets the delivery on Monday, then House 2 gets it on Tuesday, House 3 on Wednesday, and so on.\n\nLet me count the days from Monday to the following Friday. Monday is day 1, Tuesday is day 2, Wednesday is day 3, Thursday is day 4, and Friday is day 5.\n\nSo, starting from House 1 on Monday, we need to find out which house gets the delivery on Friday, which is 5 days later.\n\nIf we add 4 days to Monday, we get Friday (since Monday + 4 days = Friday).\n\nBut wait, let's think carefully. If House 1 gets it on Monday, House 2 on Tuesday, House 3 on Wednesday, House 4 on Thursday, and House 5 on Friday.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I need to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nOh, but the problem says \"the next day it's the house to its right that receives the delivery.\" So, each day, the delivery moves one house to the right.\n\nSo, starting from House 1 on Monday:\n\n- Monday: House 1\n\n- Tuesday: House 2\n\n- Wednesday: House 3\n\n- Thursday: House 4\n\n- Friday: House 5\n\nThat seems clear. But maybe I should consider if the delivery wraps around after House 10.\n\nWait, the problem says \"every day, one house gets a delivery of apples and the next day it's the house to its right that receives the delivery.\" It doesn't specify what happens after House 10. Does it go back to House 1?\n\nLet me check the question again: \"Every day, one house gets a delivery of apples and the next day it's the house to its right that receives the delivery. If House 1 received a delivery on Monday, which house will receive the delivery on the following Friday?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify what happens after House 10, but in a circular arrangement, it might wrap around. However, the houses are in a row, so it might not wrap around.\n\nBut, considering it's a row, perhaps after House 10, there is no next house, and the delivery stops. But that doesn't make sense with the problem's description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the delivery starts again from House 1 after House 10.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume it's a circular arrangement, and after House 10, it goes back to House 1.\n\nSo, let's consider that.\n\nStarting from House 1 on Monday:\n\n- Monday: House 1\n\n- Tuesday: House 2\n\n- Wednesday: House 3\n\n- Thursday: House 4\n\n- Friday: House 5\n\nSo, on Friday, it's House 5.\n\nBut if it's circular, and after House 10 it goes back to House 1, then my initial assumption holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a straight line, and after House 10, it stops.\n\nBut the problem says \"in a row,\" which could imply a straight line without wrapping around.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the delivery stops after House 10.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe it's circular.\n\nI think I need to make an assumption here.\n\nGiven that it's a village with houses in a row, it's possible that the delivery wraps around after House 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the delivery only happens to houses 1 through 10 in sequence, and then repeats.\n\nGiven that, I'll assume it's circular.\n\nTherefore, the delivery cycle is House 1 to House 10, and then back to House 1.\n\nSo, from House 1 on Monday, it proceeds as follows:\n\n- Monday: House 1\n\n- Tuesday: House 2\n\n- Wednesday: House 3\n\n- Thursday: House 4\n\n- Friday: House 5\n\nHence, on Friday, House 5 receives the delivery.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the days in terms of modulo 10, since there are 10 houses.\n\nIf House 1 is on Monday, then each day advances the delivery by one house.\n\nSo, starting from Monday as day 0 (House 1), then:\n\n- Day 0 (Monday): House 1\n\n- Day 1 (Tuesday): House 2\n\n- Day 2 (Wednesday): House 3\n\n- Day 3 (Thursday): House 4\n\n- Day 4 (Friday): House 5\n\nTherefore, on Friday, House 5 gets the delivery.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider Monday as day 1, then:\n\n- Day 1 (Monday): House 1\n\n- Day 2 (Tuesday): House 2\n\n- Day 3 (Wednesday): House 3\n\n- Day 4 (Thursday): House 4\n\n- Day 5 (Friday): House 5\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, if the delivery starts on Monday with House 1, and moves one house to the right each day, then on Friday, which is 5 days later, it would be House 5.\n\nBut wait, if Monday is day 1, and Friday is day 5, then it's straightforward: House 5.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because I feel like there might be more to this problem.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the delivery cycle might wrap around within the week.\n\nBut given that there are 10 houses and only 5 days from Monday to Friday, it's unlikely to wrap around in this short period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the delivery starts on Monday with House 1, and continues to House 10, then back to House 1 on the next day.\n\nBut in this case, within 5 days, it won't reach beyond House 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be House 5.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the possibility of a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose that the delivery starts on Monday with House 1, and then each subsequent day, it's the next house to the right, even if it's a new week.\n\nSo, Monday: House 1, Tuesday: House 2, Wednesday: House 3, Thursday: House 4, Friday: House 5.\n\nThen, the following Monday would be House 6, Tuesday: House 7, and so on.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"the following Friday,\" which is within the same week as the initial Monday.\n\nTherefore, the delivery on that Friday would be House 5.\n\nAlternatively, if \"the following Friday\" refers to the Friday after the initial Monday, then it's still House 5.\n\nUnless the delivery cycle repeats weekly, but that's not indicated in the problem.\n\nGiven the information provided, the straightforward approach is that each day the delivery moves to the next house to the right, starting from House 1 on Monday.\n\nTherefore, on Friday, which is 4 days later, it would be House 5.\n\nHence, the answer is House 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
