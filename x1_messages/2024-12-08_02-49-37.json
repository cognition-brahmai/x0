Prim's algorithm is typically used for finding the minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph, but it can also be adapted to generate random mazes. In the context of maze generation, each cell in the maze can be considered a node, and walls between cells can be considered edges.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to creating such a program:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Prim's Algorithm for Maze Generation\n\nIn maze generation, Prim's algorithm works by starting from an initial cell and repeatedly adding neighboring cells to the maze, ensuring that no cycles are created. This process continues until all cells are part of the maze.\n\n### Step 2: Representing the Maze\n\nWe can represent the maze as a 2D grid where each cell can be either a wall or a path. For simplicity, we'll use characters to represent these:\n\n- `#` for walls\n\n- ` ` (space) for paths\n\n### Step 3: Implementing the Maze Generation\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Create a grid filled with walls.\n   - Choose a starting cell and mark it as part of the maze.\n   - Add all walls of the starting cell to a list of walls.\n\n2. **Building the Maze:**\n   - While there are walls in the list:\n     - Pick a random wall from the list.\n     - If the wall divides two cells, one inside the maze and one outside:\n       - Remove the wall.\n       - Add the outside cell to the maze.\n       - Add the walls of the new cell to the list.\n     - Remove the wall from the list.\n\n3. **Display the Maze:**\n   - Print the grid as ASCII art.\n\n### Step 4: Python Code Implementation\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef make_maze(w = 12, h = 12):\n    vis = [[0] * w + [1] for _ in range(h)] + [[1] * (w + 1)]\n    ver = [[\"#  \"] * w + ['#'] for _ in range(h)] + [[]]\n    hor = [[\"###\"] * w + ['#'] for _ in range(h + 1)]\n    \n    def walk(x, y):\n        vis[y][x] = 1\n        d = [(x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1)]\n        random.shuffle(d)\n        for (xx, yy) in d:\n            if vis[yy][xx]: continue\n            if xx == x: hor[max(y, yy)][x] = \"# #\"\n            if yy == y: ver[y][max(x, xx)] = \"  \"\n            walk(xx, yy)\n    \n    walk(random.randrange(w), random.randrange(h))\n    \n    maze_rows = [''.join(row) for row in hor[:1] + [''.join(row + hor[row_idx + 1][col_idx])\n                                                     for row_idx, row in enumerate(ver[:-1])\n                                                     for col_idx in range(w)]]\n    return '\\n'.join(maze_rows)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    maze = make_maze(10, 10)\n    print(maze)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Grid Initialization:**\n   - `vis`: A 2D list to keep track of visited cells.\n   - `ver` and `hor`: Lists to represent vertical and horizontal walls.\n\n2. **Maze Generation:**\n   - `walk` function uses recursion to visit cells and remove walls between them.\n   - Starting from a random cell, it marks the cell as visited and removes walls to unvisited neighbors.\n\n3. **Maze Display:**\n   - Constructs the maze row by row, combining horizontal and vertical walls.\n   - Prints the maze as ASCII art.\n\nThis code provides a basic implementation of Prim's algorithm for maze generation and displays the maze using ASCII characters. You can adjust the width and height parameters to generate mazes of different sizes."
