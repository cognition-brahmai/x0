        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 6 feet and a height of 10 feet, and I need to find out its volume in gallons. The note says that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons, which is helpful.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to calculate the volume of a cylinder. I think the formula is volume equals pi times the radius squared times the height. Yes, that sounds right: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nSo, the diameter is 6 feet, which means the radius is half of that, right? So, radius r = 6 / 2 = 3 feet.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula: V = \u03c0 * (3)^2 * 10.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 3 squared is 9.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * 9 * 10.\n\nThat's V = 90\u03c0 cubic feet.\n\nNow, I need to convert cubic feet to gallons. The note says 1 cubic foot is about 7.48 gallons.\n\nSo, total volume in gallons is 90\u03c0 cubic feet times 7.48 gallons per cubic foot.\n\nBut, I can approximate \u03c0 as 3.1416 for more accuracy.\n\nSo, volume in cubic feet is 90 * 3.1416 = 282.744 cubic feet.\n\nThen, volume in gallons is 282.744 * 7.48 \u2248 let's see, 282.744 * 7.48.\n\nHmm, better way to calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, 282.744 * 7 = 1979.208.\n\nThen, 282.744 * 0.48 = ? Let's do 282.744 * 0.4 = 113.0976, and 282.744 * 0.08 = 22.61952.\n\nSo, 113.0976 + 22.61952 = 135.71712.\n\nNow, add that to 1979.208: 1979.208 + 135.71712 \u2248 2114.92512 gallons.\n\nBut, considering the precision of the given data, maybe I should round it to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n\nThe diameter and height are given to one decimal place, and the conversion factor is given to two decimal places.\n\nSo, probably rounding to the nearest whole number would be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the tank is approximately 2115 gallons.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nVolume of cylinder: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nDiameter d = 6 feet, so radius r = d/2 = 3 feet.\n\nHeight h = 10 feet.\n\nV = \u03c0 * (3)^2 * 10 = \u03c0 * 9 * 10 = 90\u03c0 cubic feet.\n\nNow, 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons.\n\nSo, total volume in gallons is 90\u03c0 * 7.48.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, V = 90 * 3.1416 = 282.744 cubic feet.\n\nThen, 282.744 * 7.48.\n\nLet me calculate 282.744 * 7.48 properly.\n\nFirst, 282.744 * 7 = 1979.208.\n\nSecond, 282.744 * 0.4 = 113.0976.\n\nThird, 282.744 * 0.08 = 22.61952.\n\nNow, add them up: 1979.208 + 113.0976 + 22.61952 = 2114.92512 gallons.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number: 2115 gallons.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using a more precise value of \u03c0, but since the other values are given to limited precision, three significant figures should be sufficient.\n\nSo, the volume of the tank is approximately 2115 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2115} \\]"
