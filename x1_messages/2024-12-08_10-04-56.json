        "content": "Alright, I'll help you with that. So, you need a Python function that acts like a simple calculator. It should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to decide on the function's design. Since it's a calculator, it should take two numbers and an operation as input, and then perform the specified operation on those numbers.\n\nI'll name the function `simple_calculator` for clarity. It will take three parameters: the first number, the second number, and the operation.\n\nNext, I need to define what operations are supported. You mentioned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. So, I'll support the operations '+' for addition, '-' for subtraction, '*' for multiplication, and '/' for division.\n\nInside the function, I'll use conditional statements to check which operation was requested and then perform that operation on the two numbers.\n\nI should also handle the case where the user tries to divide by zero, since division by zero is undefined. In that case, I'll need to return an error message.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that the function can handle different types of numbers, like integers and floats, but for simplicity, I'll assume that the inputs are always numbers.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the function:\n\ndef simple_calculator(num1, num2, operation):\n\nif operation == '+':\n\nreturn num1 + num2\n\nelif operation == '-':\n\nreturn num1 - num2\n\nelif operation == '*':\n\nreturn num1 * num2\n\nelif operation == '/':\n\nif num2 != 0:\n\nreturn num1 / num2\n\nelse:\n\nreturn \"Error: Division by zero\"\n\nelse:\n\nreturn \"Error: Invalid operation\"\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, I need to think about how to make this function more user-friendly. Maybe I can allow the user to input the operation as words instead of symbols, like 'add' for '+', 'subtract' for '-', 'multiply' for '*', and 'divide' for '/'.\n\nThat could make it easier for some users who might not remember the symbols.\n\nSo, I'll extend the operation checks to include both symbols and words.\n\nHere's an updated outline:\n\ndef simple_calculator(num1, num2, operation):\n\nif operation in ['+', 'add']:\n\nreturn num1 + num2\n\nelif operation in ['-', 'subtract']:\n\nreturn num1 - num2\n\nelif operation in ['*', 'multiply']:\n\nreturn num1 * num2\n\nelif operation in ['/', 'divide']:\n\nif num2 != 0:\n\nreturn num1 / num2\n\nelse:\n\nreturn \"Error: Division by zero\"\n\nelse:\n\nreturn \"Error: Invalid operation\"\n\nThis should cover more user scenarios. Now, I need to think about how to handle invalid inputs, like when the operation is something other than the supported ones, or if the numbers are not actually numbers.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the inputs are always correct, as per the initial request.\n\nLet me think about how to test this function. I should create some test cases to ensure that it works as expected.\n\nFor example:\n\n- simple_calculator(4, 2, '+') should return 6\n\n- simple_calculator(4, 2, 'subtract') should return 2\n\n- simple_calculator(4, 2, '*') should return 8\n\n- simple_calculator(4, 2, 'divide') should return 2.0\n\n- simple_calculator(4, 0, '/') should return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n\n- simple_calculator(4, 2, 'something else') should return \"Error: Invalid operation\"\n\nThese test cases cover all the basic operations and potential error scenarios.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether to make this function more advanced in the future. For example, adding support for more operations like exponentiation or modulo. But for a simple calculator, the four basic operations should suffice.\n\nAlso, I could consider making the function handle more than two numbers, but that might complicate things, so I'll stick with two numbers for now.\n\nAnother consideration is the order of operations. Since we're only dealing with two numbers at a time, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nI should also think about the data types of the inputs. If num1 and num2 are strings that represent numbers, I might need to convert them to actual numeric types. But again, for simplicity, I'll assume they are already numbers.\n\nLet me also consider floating-point precision. Python handles floating-point numbers reasonably well, but if high precision is needed, I might need to use the decimal module. But for a simple calculator, standard floating-point operations should be adequate.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the actual function code based on the outline I've sketched.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple calculator in Python that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can use the following function:\n\n```python\ndef simple_calculator(num1, num2, operation):\n    if operation in ['+', 'add']:\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation in ['-', 'subtract']:\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation in ['*', 'multiply']:\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation in ['/', 'divide']:\n        if num2 != 0:\n            return num1 / num2\n        else:\n            return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    else:\n        return \"Error: Invalid operation\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition:** The function `simple_calculator` takes three parameters: `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`.\n- **Operation Handling:**\n  - If the operation is '+' or 'add', it adds the two numbers.\n  - If the operation is '-' or 'subtract', it subtracts the second number from the first.\n  - If the operation is '*' or 'multiply', it multiplies the two numbers.\n  - If the operation is '/' or 'divide', it divides the first number by the second, provided the second number is not zero.\n- **Error Handling:**\n  - Returns \"Error: Division by zero\" if division by zero is attempted.\n  - Returns \"Error: Invalid operation\" if an unsupported operation is provided.\n\nThis function provides a straightforward way to perform basic arithmetic operations and handles common error scenarios."
