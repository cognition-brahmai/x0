        "content": "So if I'm going at a steady speed of 50 miles per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes, I need to find out how far I'll have gone, right? Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, d = s * t. Here, s is 50 miles per hour, and t is 2 hours and 30 minutes. But, I need to make sure that the units match. Since speed is in miles per hour, time should be in hours.\n\nNow, 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2.5 hours, right? Because 30 minutes is half an hour, so 2 plus 0.5 equals 2.5 hours.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: d = 50 miles/hour * 2.5 hours.\n\nLet me do the math: 50 * 2.5.\n\nWell, 50 * 2 is 100, and 50 * 0.5 is 25, so total distance is 100 + 25 = 125 miles.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 30 minutes, so total time is 150 minutes.\n\nIf I convert speed to miles per minute, it would be 50 miles per 60 minutes, which is 5/6 miles per minute.\n\nThen, distance would be 5/6 miles per minute * 150 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate that: (5/6) * 150 = (5 * 150)/6 = 750/6 = 125 miles.\n\nOkay, same answer as before. So, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: in one hour, I travel 50 miles. So in 2 hours, I travel 100 miles. In 30 minutes, which is half an hour, I travel half of 50 miles, which is 25 miles. So, total distance is 100 + 25 = 125 miles.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion. Therefore, I can confidently say that traveling at 50 miles per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes will cover a distance of 125 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
