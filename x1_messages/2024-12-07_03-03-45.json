        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 150 units per hour, and it operates for 16 hours a day. First, I need to find out how many units it produces in one day. So, I'll multiply the hourly production by the number of hours it operates daily.\n\nThat is: 150 units/hour * 16 hours/day = 2,400 units/day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I need to know how many days the factory operates in a week. Typically, a week has 7 days, so I'll assume the factory operates every day of the week unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, weekly production would be: 2,400 units/day * 7 days/week = 16,800 units/week.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if the factory operates on weekends as well. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it operates 7 days a week. If it operates only on weekdays, it would be 5 days, but that's not mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's overtime or different operating hours on certain days, but again, the problem doesn't mention that. So, I'll stick with 7 days a week.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 16,800 units in a week.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst calculation: 150 units/hour * 16 hours/day = 2,400 units/day. That seems correct.\n\nSecond calculation: 2,400 units/day * 7 days/week = 16,800 units/week. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 16,800 units per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16800} \\]"
