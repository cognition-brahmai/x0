        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Jane rented a car from this company, and she paid a total of $65 for one day. The company charges a flat fee of $20 per day just for renting the car, and then they add 15 cents for every mile you drive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's included in the total amount Jane paid. The total cost consists of the daily flat fee plus the cost for the miles she drove. So, if I can figure out how much she paid just for the miles, I can then determine how many miles she drove.\n\nLet me start by subtracting the flat fee from the total amount she paid. That should give me the amount that's exclusively for the miles driven.\n\nTotal paid: $65\n\nFlat fee for one day: $20\n\nAmount paid for miles: $65 - $20 = $45\n\nSo, Jane paid $45 for the miles she drove.\n\nNow, the company charges 15 cents per mile. To find out how many miles she drove, I need to divide the amount she paid for miles by the cost per mile.\n\nCost per mile: $0.15\n\nMiles driven: $45 / $0.15\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n45 divided by 0.15.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 45 divided by 3/20, since 0.15 is the same as 3/20.\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so:\n\n45 / (3/20) = 45 * (20/3) = (45 * 20) / 3\n\nFirst, 45 times 20 is 900.\n\nThen, 900 divided by 3 is 300.\n\nSo, Jane drove 300 miles.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal paid: $65\n\nFlat fee: $20\n\nAmount paid for miles: $65 - $20 = $45\n\nCost per mile: $0.15\n\nMiles driven: $45 / $0.15\n\nNow, $45 divided by $0.15.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 0.15 goes into 45 how many times?\n\nWell, 0.15 times 300 is 45.\n\nSo, yes, 300 miles.\n\nLet me confirm this by plugging the number back into the original cost equation.\n\nFlat fee: $20\n\nCost for miles: 300 miles * $0.15/mile = $45\n\nTotal cost: $20 + $45 = $65\n\nThat matches the total Jane paid.\n\nSo, my final answer is 300 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
