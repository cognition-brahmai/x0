        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:\n\n1. **Divide**: If the array has only one element, it's already sorted. Otherwise, divide the array into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Go.\n\nFirst, we need a function to merge two sorted slices. This function will take two slices and merge them into a single sorted slice.\n\nSecond, we need the main merge sort function that will recursively divide the slice and call the merge function to combine the results.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// merge combines two sorted slices into one sorted slice\nfunc merge(left, right []int) []int {\n\tresult := make([]int, 0, len(left)+len(right))\n\ti, j := 0, 0\n\n\tfor i < len(left) && j < len(right) {\n\t\tif left[i] < right[j] {\n\t\t\tresult = append(result, left[i])\n\t\t\ti++\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tresult = append(result, right[j])\n\t\t\tj++\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Append any remaining elements from left or right\n\tresult = append(result, left[i:]...)\n\tresult = append(result, right[j:]...)\n\n\treturn result\n}\n\n// mergeSort recursively sorts a slice using merge sort\nfunc mergeSort(arr []int) []int {\n\tif len(arr) <= 1 {\n\t\treturn arr\n\t}\n\n\t// Find the middle point\n\tmid := len(arr) / 2\n\n\t// Divide the slice into two halves\n\tleft := mergeSort(arr[:mid])\n\tright := mergeSort(arr[mid:])\n\n\t// Merge the sorted halves\n\treturn merge(left, right)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tarr := []int{38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10}\n\tfmt.Println(\"Original array:\", arr)\n\tsortedArr := mergeSort(arr)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Sorted array:\", sortedArr)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **merge function**:\n   - This function takes two sorted slices (`left` and `right`) and merges them into a single sorted slice.\n   - It uses two pointers (`i` and `j`) to traverse the `left` and `right` slices, respectively.\n   - It compares the elements at these pointers and appends the smaller one to the result slice.\n   - Finally, it appends any remaining elements from either slice.\n\n2. **mergeSort function**:\n   - This is the main function that implements the merge sort algorithm.\n   - If the slice has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so it returns the slice as is.\n   - Otherwise, it finds the middle point and divides the slice into two halves.\n   - It recursively sorts these two halves and then merges them using the `merge` function.\n\n3. **main function**:\n   - It initializes an example array.\n   - Prints the original array.\n   - Calls `mergeSort` to sort the array.\n   - Prints the sorted array.\n\nThis should give you a good understanding of how merge sort works in Go.
