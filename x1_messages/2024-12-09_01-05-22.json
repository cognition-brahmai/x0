Your thoughtfulness and kindness mean the world to me, and I am truly touched by your gesture.\n\nReceiving the magnificent eagle owl as my birthday present was beyond anything I could have ever imagined. I must admit, I was initially overwhelmed by its sheer size and beauty, but as I spent more time with it, I realized what an extraordinary companion and friend it would be. Its stunning appearance and wise eyes have already captured the hearts of everyone at Hogwarts.\n\nI can't thank you enough for choosing such a special and meaningful gift. It not only brings joy to my life but also serves as a constant reminder of your unwavering support and friendship. Knowing that you took the time and effort to select something so perfect for me fills me with warmth and appreciation.\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks once again. I look forward to many more adventures and memories with my new feathered friend, thanks to your generosity.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\nHarry Potter"
