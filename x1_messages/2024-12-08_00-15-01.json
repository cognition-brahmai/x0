        "content": "In the depths of the river, where the currents run free,\nLives a most curious creature, as whimsical as can be.\nWith fur so sleek and eyes so bright,\nThe otter plays all day and night.\n\nIn the style of Lewis Carroll, I'll attempt to craft a verse,\nAbout these delightful creatures, who bring joy to every verse.\n\nDown by the riverbank, where the rushes grow tall,\nOtters frolic and play, in their own special hall.\nThey dive and they dip, in the water so clear,\nChasing fish and bubbles, with laughter to hear.\n\nOh, the otters are clever, with paws like a dancer,\nThey twirl and they spin, in the river's expanse.\nTheir tails waggle merrily, as they play their own game,\nIn this world of their own, where time stands still in fame.\n\nThey build their homes in the banks, with care and with glee,\nUsing sticks and stones, and mud from the sea.\nTheir families are close-knit, with love in each heart,\nSharing stories and songs, in the otter's own art.\n\nIn the moonlit night, when the world is asleep,\nOtters hold secret meetings, in the river's deep.\nThey discuss the tides and the stars above,\nAnd the mysteries of the world, in their otter love.\n\nOh, to be an otter, in this world so wide,\nWith the river as your playground, and the sky as your guide.\nTo dance with the currents, and laugh with the breeze,\nIn a world of wonder, where happiness never ceases.\n\nSo here's to the otters, in their river so fair,\nMay they continue to play, with neither care nor scare.\nIn the style of Carroll, I've tried to convey,\nThe magic of otters, in verse that's gay."
