Regular expressions, or regex for short, are a powerful tool for pattern matching in strings. They might look a bit complicated at first, but once you get the hang of them, they're really useful.\n\nFirst, you'll need to import the `re` module in Python, which provides support for regular expressions. Then, you'll ask the user to input an email address. After that, you'll define a regex pattern that matches the general structure of a valid email address.\n\nA simple email validation regex pattern could look something like this:\n\n```regex\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- `^` asserts the start of the string.\n\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches one or more characters that are common in the username part of an email, such as letters, digits, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus and minus signs.\n\n- `@` matches the at symbol.\n\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches one or more characters for the domain name, including letters, digits, dots, and hyphens.\n\n- `\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}` matches a dot followed by two or more letters for the top-level domain.\n\n- `$` asserts the end of the string.\n\nSo, putting this into a Python script, it might look like this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_email(email):\n    pattern = r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\"\n    if re.match(pattern, email):\n        return \"Valid Email\"\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid Email\"\n\n# Get user input\nuser_email = input(\"Please enter your email address: \")\n\n# Validate and print result\nprint(validate_email(user_email))\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `validate_email` that takes an email string and checks it against the regex pattern. If it matches, it returns \"Valid Email\"; otherwise, \"Invalid Email\". Then, it prompts the user to enter an email address and prints the validation result.\n\nKeep in mind that email validation can get more complex depending on how thorough you want to be. The regex above covers most common cases but might not account for all possible valid email addresses as per the official specifications. However, for most practical purposes, this should work just fine.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
