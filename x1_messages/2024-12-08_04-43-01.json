        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box with 20 red balls and 30 blue balls, making a total of 50 balls. I need to figure out how many balls I must pick without replacement to guarantee that I have at least 10 red balls. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means to guarantee at least 10 red balls. It means that no matter how the balls are arranged or in what order I pick them, I'm sure to have at least 10 red balls after picking a certain number of balls.\n\nI know that there are 20 red balls and 30 blue balls. If I want to guarantee at least 10 red balls, I need to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario would be picking as many blue balls as possible before picking the red ones.\n\nSo, in the worst case, I could pick all 30 blue balls first. That means I've picked 30 balls, and none of them are red. Now, the next balls I pick will have to be red because there are only red balls left in the box.\n\nSo, after picking 30 blue balls, the next 10 balls I pick will be red, since there are 20 red balls in total. Therefore, to guarantee that I have at least 10 red balls, I need to pick 30 (all blue balls) + 10 (to ensure I have at least 10 red balls) = 40 balls.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I pick 40 balls, and the first 30 are blue, then the next 10 are red, which gives me exactly 10 red balls. But the problem asks for at least 10 red balls, so 10 or more. So, picking 40 balls guarantees that I have at least 10 red balls.\n\nBut, maybe there's a better way to think about it. Let's consider that there are 20 red balls and 30 blue balls. If I pick 39 balls, it's possible that I could have picked 30 blue balls and 9 red balls, which means I don't have 10 red balls yet. But if I pick one more ball, making it 40 balls, that last ball has to be red because there are only 10 red balls left. So, indeed, picking 40 balls guarantees that I have at least 10 red balls.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the maximum number of balls I can pick without having 10 red balls, and then add one more ball to ensure that I do have at least 10 red balls.\n\nSo, the maximum number of balls without having 10 red balls would be all 30 blue balls plus 9 red balls, which totals 39 balls. So, if I pick 39 balls, it's possible to have 30 blue and 9 red. But picking the 40th ball guarantees that I have at least 10 red balls, because there are only red balls left in the box.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 40 balls.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose there are 20 red and 30 blue balls. If I pick 40 balls, the only way I don't have at least 10 red balls is if I picked all 30 blue balls and only 10 red balls, but that's not possible because if I pick 40 balls, and there are only 30 blue balls, then I must have picked 10 red balls. Wait, no: 40 balls picked would be 30 blue and 10 red, which is exactly 10 red balls, which satisfies \"at least 10 red balls.\"\n\nBut the problem is to guarantee at least 10 red balls. So, in the worst case, picking 39 balls could give me 30 blue and 9 red, which is not enough. But picking 40 balls ensures that I have at least 10 red balls.\n\nAlternatively, if I pick 41 balls, I would have at least 11 red balls, but that's more than necessary. So, 40 is the minimal number that guarantees at least 10 red balls.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose I want to guarantee k red balls. Is there a general formula for this?\n\nIn general, if there are R red balls and B blue balls, and I want to guarantee k red balls, then the number of balls I need to pick is B + k.\n\nIn this case, B = 30, k = 10, so B + k = 40, which matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nBut wait, is this always true? Let's test it with smaller numbers. Suppose there are 5 red balls and 5 blue balls, and I want to guarantee 3 red balls. According to this formula, it would be 5 (blue) + 3 = 8 balls. But in reality, there are only 10 balls in total, so picking 8 balls would mean that in the worst case, I have 5 blue and 3 red balls, which matches.\n\nAnother test: 3 red balls and 4 blue balls, want to guarantee 2 red balls. According to the formula, it's 4 + 2 = 6 balls. But in reality, there are only 7 balls in total. Picking 6 balls could mean 4 blue and 2 red, which guarantees at least 2 red balls.\n\nSo, the formula seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, with 30 blue balls and wanting at least 10 red balls, the number of balls to pick is 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nSo, the answer is 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
