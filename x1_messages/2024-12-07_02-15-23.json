        "content": "The two planets in our solar system that are referred to as \"ice giants\" are Uranus and Neptune. These planets are distinct from the other giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, which are classified as \"gas giants.\" Uranus and Neptune are called ice giants because a significant portion of their mass consists of water, ammonia, and methane ices, in addition to hydrogen and helium gases. Their atmospheres contain higher proportions of these volatiles compared to the gas giants, giving them different physical and chemical characteristics."
