        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. I'll guide you through creating a Python program that implements this algorithm using an adjacency matrix.\n\nFirst, let's understand what an adjacency matrix is. It's a 2D list where the value at the ith row and jth column represents the weight of the edge between node i and node j. If there is no edge, the weight is typically set to infinity or a large number.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the graph**: Use an adjacency matrix to represent the graph.\n2. **Set up distances**: Create a list to store the shortest distances from the start node to each node. Initialize all distances to infinity except the start node, which is 0.\n3. **Track visited nodes**: Use a set to keep track of nodes that have already been visited to avoid processing them multiple times.\n4. **Priority queue**: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the node with the smallest distance.\n5. **Relaxation**: For each neighboring node of the current node, check if the distance can be reduced via the current node. If so, update the distance.\n6. **Repeat until all nodes are visited or the target node is reached**.\n\nNow, let's translate this into code.\n\nFirst, we need to import the necessary modules. We'll use `heapq` for the priority queue.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport math\n```\n\nNext, let's define the function for Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, end):\n    n = len(graph)\n    distances = [math.inf] * n\n    distances[start] = 0\n    visited = [False] * n\n    priority_queue = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)\n    \n    while priority_queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        \n        if visited[current_node]:\n            continue\n        visited[current_node] = True\n        \n        if current_node == end:\n            return distances[end]\n        \n        for neighbor in range(n):\n            weight = graph[current_node][neighbor]\n            if weight != 0 and not visited[neighbor]:\n                distance = distances[current_node] + weight\n                if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                    distances[neighbor] = distance\n                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n- We initialize `distances` with infinity for all nodes except the `start` node, which is set to 0.\n- We use a `visited` list to keep track of nodes that have been processed.\n- A `priority_queue` is used to always select the node with the smallest distance.\n- We loop until the priority queue is empty.\n- For each node, we update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n- If we reach the `end` node, we return the shortest distance found.\n\nFinally, let's test this function with an example.\n\nSuppose we have the following adjacency matrix:\n\n```\ngraph = [\n    [0, 10, 20, 0, 0],\n    [10, 0, 5, 16, 1],\n    [20, 5, 0, 20, 2],\n    [0, 16, 20, 0, 5],\n    [0, 1, 2, 5, 0]\n]\n```\n\nAnd we want to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n```python\ngraph = [\n    [0, 10, 20, 0, 0],\n    [10, 0, 5, 16, 1],\n    [20, 5, 0, 20, 2],\n    [0, 16, 20, 0, 5],\n    [0, 1, 2, 5, 0]\n]\n\nstart = 0\nend = 3\n\nshortest_distance = dijkstra(graph, start, end)\nprint(f\"The shortest distance from node {start} to node {end} is {shortest_distance}\")\n```\n\nThis should output the shortest distance from node 0 to node 3.\n\nThat's it! You now have a Python program that implements Dijkstra's algorithm using an adjacency matrix. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask."
