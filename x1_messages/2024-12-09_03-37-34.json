        "content": "So, the company has 200 employees right now, and they want to increase their workforce by 15%. To find out how many new employees that corresponds to, I need to calculate 15% of 200.\n\nFirst, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal. 15% is the same as 15/100, which is 0.15.\n\nNext, I'll multiply the current number of employees by this decimal to find the number of new employees:\n\n200 employees * 0.15 = 30 employees\n\nSo, the company will hire 30 new employees.\n\nTo find the total number of employees after the hiring, I'll add the new employees to the current number:\n\n200 employees + 30 employees = 230 employees\n\nTherefore, after hiring, the company will have a total of 230 employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{230} \\]"
