Each step in your plan should be followed by an evidence value that corresponds to the output of one of the available functions given an input string, which can be the user's query, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information on the internet. The function does not directly provide answers but gives a list of websites that may contain the required information.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from web pages based on a newline delimited list of links as input and produces plain text content of these links.\nLinkFilter[input]: Filters out irrelevant links from a newline delimited list of links and provides a more focused list of links.\nAskJeeves[input]: A tool that answers questions based on general knowledge or context provided. The input must be a question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the population of Paris, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function should be a simple string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., AskJeeves[What is the capital of France, given :evidence2:?]\n\nEach plan step should only include one evidence output.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action to take based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may reference previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics and what was their contribution to science?"
