        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from Station A to Station B, which is 240 miles apart, and it takes 4 hours to do that. I need to find its average speed.\n\nI remember that average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. So, in this case, it would be the distance between the two stations divided by the time it takes to go from one to the other.\n\nSo, average speed = distance / time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\naverage speed = 240 miles / 4 hours\n\nNow, doing the division:\n\n240 divided by 4 is 60.\n\nSo, the average speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward. Maybe there's something else I should consider.\n\nIs the train moving at a constant speed? The question says it travels at a constant speed, so that means its speed doesn't change during the journey. That makes sense because if the speed varied, we'd need to consider different speeds at different times.\n\nBut in this case, since it's constant, the average speed should be the same as the constant speed throughout the journey.\n\nSo, the answer should be 60 miles per hour.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula:\n\nspeed = distance / time\n\nWhich is essentially the same as the average speed formula.\n\nSo, again, speed = 240 miles / 4 hours = 60 miles per hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of miles per minute.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 240 minutes.\n\nThen, speed in miles per minute would be 240 miles / 240 minutes = 1 mile per minute.\n\nBut 1 mile per minute is equivalent to 60 miles per hour, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\nSo, again, that confirms the speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the question is trying to trick me by giving distances and times that are related numerically but in different units.\n\nBut no, 240 miles and 4 hours, that seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a need to consider the acceleration or something, but the question says it's traveling at a constant speed, so no acceleration.\n\nAlso, it's a train, so probably moving on tracks, no need to consider changes in direction or anything like that.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that the average speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider the possibilities of any units conversion.\n\nBut since both distance is in miles and time is in hours, and we want speed in miles per hour, no conversion is needed.\n\nEverything is consistent in units.\n\nTherefore, the answer is definitely 60 miles per hour.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this.\n\nSo, the train's average speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
