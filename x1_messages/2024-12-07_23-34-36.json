        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from City A to City B, which is 300 miles apart, and then returns back to City A. On the way to City B, it travels at 60 miles per hour, and on the way back, it goes at 40 miles per hour. We need to find the average speed for the entire round trip.\n\nFirst, I think I need to recall what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nThe total distance is straightforward. Since the train goes from City A to City B and back, that's 300 miles each way, so total distance is 300 miles + 300 miles = 600 miles.\n\nNow, I need to find the total time taken for the entire trip. To do that, I need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and then add them together.\n\nFirst, the time taken to go from City A to City B at 60 mph. Time is distance divided by speed, so time = 300 miles / 60 mph = 5 hours.\n\nNext, the time taken to return from City B to City A at 40 mph. Again, time = distance / speed = 300 miles / 40 mph = 7.5 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is 5 hours + 7.5 hours = 12.5 hours.\n\nNow, average speed = total distance / total time = 600 miles / 12.5 hours. Let me calculate that.\n\n600 divided by 12.5... hmm, 12.5 times 48 is 600, because 12.5 times 40 is 500, and 12.5 times 8 is 100, so 500 + 100 is 600. So, the average speed is 48 mph.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal distance: 300 miles each way, so 600 miles.\n\nTime to City B: 300 / 60 = 5 hours.\n\nTime back to City A: 300 / 40 = 7.5 hours.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 7.5 = 12.5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 600 / 12.5 = 48 mph.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of something called the harmonic mean for average speeds when the distances are the same but speeds are different. Maybe I can verify my answer using that method.\n\nThe formula for the harmonic mean of two speeds is: 2 * (speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nSo, plugging in the values: 2 * (60 * 40) / (60 + 40) = 2 * 2400 / 100 = 4800 / 100 = 48 mph.\n\nGreat, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed for the entire trip is 48 mph.\n\nI think that makes sense because the average speed should be between the two speeds, and 48 mph is between 40 and 60 mph. Since the train spends more time at the slower speed (40 mph) on the way back, the average speed is closer to 40 mph than to 60 mph.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Suppose the train travels at different speeds for different distances, but in this case, it's the same distance each way, just different speeds.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total time spent traveling and make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nTime to City B: 5 hours.\n\nTime back to City A: 7.5 hours.\n\nTotal time: 12.5 hours.\n\nTotal distance: 600 miles.\n\nAverage speed: 600 / 12.5 = 48 mph.\n\nYes, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
