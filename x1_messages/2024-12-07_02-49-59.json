        "content": "So there are 100 students, each with a unique favorite number between 1 and 1000. I need to find out the maximum number of students who could have a favorite number that's a multiple of 3 or 7.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means for a number to be a multiple of 3 or 7. A multiple of 3 is any number that can be expressed as 3k, where k is an integer. Similarly, a multiple of 7 is any number that can be expressed as 7m, where m is an integer.\n\nTo find the maximum number of students who have a favorite number that's a multiple of 3 or 7, I need to find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are multiples of 3 or 7.\n\nI can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that to find the number of elements in the union of two sets, you add the number of elements in each set and then subtract the number of elements that are in both sets.\n\nSo, the number of multiples of 3 or 7 between 1 and 1000 is:\n\nNumber of multiples of 3 + Number of multiples of 7 - Number of multiples of both 3 and 7 (which are multiples of 21).\n\nFirst, let's find the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 1000.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 3 in this range is 3, and the largest is 999.\n\nTo find the number of multiples, I can divide 999 by 3:\n\n999 \u00f7 3 = 333.\n\nSo, there are 333 multiples of 3 between 1 and 1000.\n\nNext, let's find the number of multiples of 7 between 1 and 1000.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 7 in this range is 7, and the largest is 994.\n\nTo find the number of multiples, I can divide 994 by 7:\n\n994 \u00f7 7 = 142.\n\nSo, there are 142 multiples of 7 between 1 and 1000.\n\nNow, let's find the number of multiples of both 3 and 7, which are multiples of 21.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 21 in this range is 21, and the largest is 987.\n\nTo find the number of multiples, I can divide 987 by 21:\n\n987 \u00f7 21 = 47.\n\nSo, there are 47 multiples of 21 between 1 and 1000.\n\nNow, applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nNumber of multiples of 3 or 7 = 333 + 142 - 47 = 428.\n\nSo, there are 428 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 7.\n\nHowever, there are only 100 students, each with a unique favorite number between 1 and 1000.\n\nTo maximize the number of students who have a favorite number that's a multiple of 3 or 7, I need to consider the maximum possible overlap between the students' favorite numbers and the multiples of 3 or 7.\n\nSince there are 428 numbers that are multiples of 3 or 7, and only 100 students, it's possible for all 100 students to have a favorite number that's a multiple of 3 or 7, as 100 is less than 428.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have a favorite number that's a multiple of 3 or 7 is 100.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nThe problem states that each student has a unique favorite number between 1 and 1000. So, the favorite numbers are distinct.\n\nThere are 428 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 7.\n\nSince there are 100 students and 428 possible numbers that are multiples of 3 or 7, it's possible for all 100 students to pick different numbers that are multiples of 3 or 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have a favorite number that's a multiple of 3 or 7 is indeed 100.\n\nAlternatively, if there were fewer multiples of 3 or 7 than students, the maximum would be equal to the number of such multiples.\n\nBut in this case, since there are more multiples of 3 or 7 (428) than students (100), the maximum is equal to the number of students, which is 100.\n\nSo, the answer is 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
