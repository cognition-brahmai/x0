        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. We have a group of 50 people, out of which 20 are vegetarians and 30 are non-vegetarians. The question is, if you randomly pick two people from this group, what's the probability that both of them are vegetarians?\n\nOkay, probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step. First, I need to recall the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is selecting two vegetarians, and the total possible outcomes are all possible pairs of people that can be selected from the group.\n\nSo, let's find the total number of ways to select two people from 50. That sounds like a combination problem because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for the total number of possible outcomes, it's C(50, 2).\n\nSimilarly, the number of favorable outcomes, which is selecting two vegetarians from 20, would be C(20, 2).\n\nTherefore, the probability should be C(20, 2) divided by C(50, 2).\n\nLet me calculate these values.\n\nFirst, C(50, 2):\n\nC(50, 2) = 50! / (2!(50 - 2)!) = (50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 48!) = (50 \u00d7 49) / 2 = 1225\n\nNext, C(20, 2):\n\nC(20, 2) = 20! / (2!(20 - 2)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 18!)= (20 \u00d7 19) / 2 = 190\n\nSo, the probability is 190 / 1225.\n\nI can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5.\n\n190 \u00f7 5 = 38\n\n1225 \u00f7 5 = 245\n\nSo, it becomes 38 / 245.\n\nCan this be simplified further? Let's see.\n\n38 and 245.\n\n38 factors: 1, 2, 19, 38\n\n245 factors: 1, 5, 7, 35, 49, 245\n\nNo common factors other than 1, so 38/245 is the simplified form.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a better sense of the probability.\n\n38 divided by 245 is approximately 0.1551, or about 15.51%.\n\nSo, the probability that both selected people are vegetarians is 38/245, or approximately 15.51%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities sequentially.\n\nLet's think about it differently. The probability that the first person selected is a vegetarian is 20/50, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nThen, given that the first person is a vegetarian, there are now 19 vegetarians left and a total of 49 people left to choose from.\n\nSo, the probability that the second person is also a vegetarian, given that the first one is, is 19/49.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability that both are vegetarians is (2/5) \u00d7 (19/49).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 2/5 \u00d7 19/49 = (2 \u00d7 19) / (5 \u00d7 49) = 38 / 245\n\nThat's the same result I got earlier using combinations.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is 38/245.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the probability that both are vegetarians as the product of the individual probabilities, but that wouldn't be correct because the selections are dependent; the outcome of the first selection affects the second.\n\nThat's why I had to use the conditional probability approach, which is what I did second.\n\nAlternatively, using combinations, which is a straightforward way to calculate the probability in one shot.\n\nI think I've covered it from both angles, and both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 38/245 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me just see if there's any other aspect to this problem that I might have missed.\n\nThe problem states that there are 50 people, 20 vegetarians, and 30 non-vegetarians. It's a straightforward setup without any additional constraints or conditions that might affect the selection.\n\nSo, I don't think there's anything else I need to consider.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 38/245.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{38}{245}} \\]"
