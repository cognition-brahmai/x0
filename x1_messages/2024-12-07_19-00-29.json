It includes member functions to calculate the distance between two points and to check if three points form a triangle. Additionally, the addition operator (+) is overloaded to add the coordinates of two points.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nclass Point2D {\nprivate:\n    double x;\n    double y;\n\npublic:\n    // Constructor\n    Point2D(double x = 0.0, double y = 0.0) : x(x), y(y) {}\n\n    // Getter for x\n    double getX() const {\n        return x;\n    }\n\n    // Getter for y\n    double getY() const {\n        return y;\n    }\n\n    // Setter for x\n    void setX(double x) {\n        this->x = x;\n    }\n\n    // Setter for y\n    void setY(double y) {\n        this->y = y;\n    }\n\n    // Calculate distance between two points\n    double distance(const Point2D& other) const {\n        double dx = x - other.x;\n        double dy = y - other.y;\n        return std::sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n    }\n\n    // Check if three points form a triangle\n    static bool isTriangle(const Point2D& p1, const Point2D& p2, const Point2D& p3) {\n        double a = p1.distance(p2);\n        double b = p2.distance(p3);\n        double c = p3.distance(p1);\n\n        // Check if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side\n        return (a + b > c) && (a + c > b) && (b + c > a);\n    }\n\n    // Overload the addition operator\n    Point2D operator+(const Point2D& other) const {\n        return Point2D(x + other.x, y + other.y);\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    // Create some points\n    Point2D p1(0, 0);\n    Point2D p2(3, 4);\n    Point2D p3(6, 0);\n\n    // Calculate distance between p1 and p2\n    std::cout << \"Distance between p1 and p2: \" << p1.distance(p2) << std::endl;\n\n    // Check if p1, p2, p3 form a triangle\n    std::cout << \"Do p1, p2, p3 form a triangle? \" << (Point2D::isTriangle(p1, p2, p3) ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\n\n    // Add p1 and p2\n    Point2D p4 = p1 + p2;\n    std::cout << \"p4 coordinates: (\" << p4.getX() << \", \" << p4.getY() << \")\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class Definition**:\n   - `Point2D` class has private members `x` and `y` to store the coordinates.\n   - A constructor to initialize `x` and `y`.\n   - Getter and setter methods for `x` and `y`.\n\n2. **Distance Calculation**:\n   - The `distance` method calculates the Euclidean distance between two points using the formula `sqrt((dx)^2 + (dy)^2)`.\n\n3. **Triangle Check**:\n   - The `isTriangle` static method checks if three points form a triangle by verifying the triangle inequality theorem for all three sides.\n\n4. **Operator Overloading**:\n   - The `+` operator is overloaded to add the coordinates of two points, returning a new `Point2D` object with the summed coordinates.\n\n5. **Main Function**:\n   - Demonstrates creating points, calculating distances, checking if points form a triangle, and using the overloaded `+` operator."
