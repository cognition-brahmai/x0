        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a basic chat server in Java using sockets. It needs to handle multiple clients, broadcast messages to all connected clients, and also support private messaging between clients. Plus, it should handle client disconnections gracefully. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basics of socket programming in Java. Sockets allow for communication between two machines over a network. In this case, I'll have a server socket that listens for incoming connections from clients. Each client will connect to the server via their own socket.\n\nSince multiple clients need to connect, I'll have to manage multiple client sockets. In Java, this typically involves using threads, where each client connection is handled by its own thread. This way, the server can handle multiple clients concurrently.\n\nNow, for broadcasting messages to all connected clients, I'll need a way to keep track of all the active client sockets. Maybe I'll use a list to store references to all connected clients. When a message needs to be broadcasted, I'll iterate through the list and send the message to each client.\n\nPrivate messaging is a bit trickier. I'll need a way to identify each client uniquely, probably by assigning them a username or a client ID. Then, when a client wants to send a private message, they'll specify the recipient's username or ID, and the server will route the message only to that specific client.\n\nHandling disconnections gracefully means that when a client disconnects, the server should remove them from the list of active clients and notify the other clients about the disconnection. This will prevent any errors or exceptions when trying to send messages to a disconnected client.\n\nLet me think about the flow of the program.\n\n1. The server starts by creating a ServerSocket on a specific port.\n\n2. It then enters a loop where it waits for incoming client connections.\n\n3. When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and starts a new thread to handle that client's communications.\n\n4. In the client handler thread, the server can read messages from the client and process them accordingly.\n\n5. If the message is a broadcast message, it's sent to all connected clients.\n\n6. If the message is a private message, it's sent only to the specified recipient.\n\n7. If a client disconnects, the server removes them from the list of active clients and notifies the other clients.\n\nI'll need to define a protocol for the messages. For example, messages starting with \"/private\" could indicate a private message, followed by the recipient's username and the actual message.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking. That's why using threads for each client is important.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n- Thread safety: When multiple threads are accessing and modifying the list of active clients, I need to synchronize access to avoid concurrency issues.\n\n- Exception handling: Need to handle cases where a client disconnects unexpectedly without proper notification.\n\n- Resource management: Make sure to close sockets and release resources properly when clients disconnect.\n\nLet me sketch a rough class structure.\n\n- **ChatServer** class:\n\n- Creates the ServerSocket.\n\n- Listens for incoming connections.\n\n- For each connection, starts a new ClientHandler thread.\n\n- Manages the list of active clients.\n\n- **ClientHandler** class (extends Thread):\n\n- Handles communication with a single client.\n\n- Reads messages from the client.\n\n- Processes the messages and broadcasts or routes them privately.\n\n- Handles disconnection.\n\n- **Client** class:\n\n- Represents a connected client.\n\n- Contains information like username, socket, etc.\n\nI need to decide how clients will register their usernames. Maybe when they first connect, they send a \"username\" message to the server, which then assigns that username to the client.\n\nSecurity isn't a major concern here since this is a basic chat server, but I should at least ensure that usernames are unique.\n\nLet me think about the message format.\n\n- **Broadcast message**: plain text.\n\n- **Private message**: \"/private username message\"\n\n- **Username registration**: \"/username desired_username\"\n\nI need to parse the messages to determine their type and act accordingly.\n\nAlso, when a client connects, the server should send a welcome message and prompt them to set a username.\n\nWhen a client disconnects, the server should send a notification to all other clients indicating that the client has left.\n\nI should also think about how to close the server gracefully, perhaps by listening for a specific command like \"/shutdown\" with admin privileges, but that might be overkill for this basic version.\n\nLet me start by outlining the steps in code.\n\nFirst, the ChatServer class:\n\n- Create a ServerSocket on a specified port.\n\n- Maintain a list of Client objects.\n\n- Listen for incoming connections in a loop.\n\n- For each connection, create a new ClientHandler thread, passing the socket and the list of clients.\n\n- Start the ClientHandler thread.\n\nThe ClientHandler class:\n\n- Read messages from the client's socket.\n\n- If the message starts with \"/username\", set the username for this client.\n\n- If the message starts with \"/private\", extract the recipient and the message, and send it only to that recipient.\n\n- Otherwise, broadcast the message to all connected clients.\n\n- Handle disconnection by removing the client from the list and notifying others.\n\nI need to ensure that the list of clients is accessed safely in a multi-threaded environment. I can use synchronized methods or collections like CopyOnWriteArrayList for thread safety.\n\nLet me consider using CopyOnWriteArrayList for the list of clients, as it's designed for scenarios where concurrent read operations are common, and write operations are less frequent.\n\nAlso, I need to handle I/O exceptions and close resources properly when a client disconnects.\n\nLet me think about the client side briefly, even though the task is to create the server. The client would need to connect to the server via a Socket, send messages to the server, and receive messages from the server.\n\nProbably, the client would have two threads: one for reading messages from the server and printing them, and another for reading user input and sending messages to the server.\n\nBut since the task is to create the server, I'll focus on that.\n\nLet me start writing some pseudocode.\n\n**ChatServer class:**\n\n- private List<Client> clients = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();\n\n- public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n- int port = 1234;\n\n- try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)) {\n\n- System.out.println(\"Server started on port \" + port);\n\n- while (true) {\n\n- Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n\n- ClientHandler handler = new ClientHandler(clientSocket, clients);\n\n- new Thread(handler).start();\n\n- }\n\n- } catch (IOException e) {\n\n- e.printStackTrace();\n\n- }\n\n- }\n\n**ClientHandler class:**\n\n- private Socket socket;\n\n- private BufferedReader in;\n\n- private PrintWriter out;\n\n- private List<Client> clients;\n\n- private Client client;\n\n- public ClientHandler(Socket socket, List<Client> clients) {\n\n- this.socket = socket;\n\n- this.clients = clients;\n\n- try {\n\n- this.in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n\n- this.out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n- this.client = new Client(socket, null); // username to be set later\n\n- clients.add(client);\n\n- } catch (IOException e) {\n\n- e.printStackTrace();\n\n- }\n\n- }\n\n- public void run() {\n\n- String message;\n\n- try {\n\n- while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n\n- if (message.startsWith(\"/username\")) {\n\n- handleUsername(message);\n\n- } else if (message.startsWith(\"/private\")) {\n\n- handlePrivateMessage(message);\n\n- } else {\n\n- broadcastMessage(message);\n\n- }\n\n- }\n\n- } catch (IOException e) {\n\n- e.printStackTrace();\n\n- } finally {\n\n- clients.remove(client);\n\n- notifyDisconnection();\n\n- try {\n\n- socket.close();\n\n- } catch (IOException e) {\n\n- e.printStackTrace();\n\n- }\n\n- }\n\n- }\n\n- private void handleUsername(String message) {\n\n- String username = message.substring(10).trim(); // assuming \"/username desired_username\"\n\n- if (username.isEmpty()) {\n\n- out.println(\"Invalid username format.\");\n\n- } else if (isUsernameTaken(username)) {\n\n- out.println(\"Username already taken. Please choose another.\");\n\n- } else {\n\n- client.setUsername(username);\n\n- out.println(\"Username set to: \" + username);\n\n- }\n\n- }\n\n- private boolean isUsernameTaken(String username) {\n\n- for (Client c : clients) {\n\n- if (c.getUsername().equals(username)) {\n\n- return true;\n\n- }\n\n- }\n\n- return false;\n\n- }\n\n- private void handlePrivateMessage(String message) {\n\n- // Extract recipient and message\n\n- // Send only to the specified recipient\n\n- }\n\n- private void broadcastMessage(String message) {\n\n- // Send message to all clients except the sender\n\n- }\n\n- private void notifyDisconnection() {\n\n- // Notify all clients that this client has disconnected\n\n- }\n\n**Client class:**\n\n- private Socket socket;\n\n- private String username;\n\n- public Client(Socket socket, String username) {\n\n- this.socket = socket;\n\n- this.username = username;\n\n- }\n\n- public String getUsername() {\n\n- return username;\n\n- }\n\n- public void setUsername(String username) {\n\n- this.username = username;\n\n- }\n\nThis is a rough outline. I need to fill in the details for handling private messages and broadcasting.\n\nFor private messaging, I need to parse the message to extract the recipient's username and the actual message. Then, find the client with that username and send the message only to them.\n\nFor broadcasting, I need to send the message to all clients except the sender.\n\nI also need to handle the case where a client tries to send a private message to a nonexistent user.\n\nAdditionally, when a client disconnects, the server should send a notification to all other clients indicating that the client has left.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the broadcastMessage method.\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- For each client, if it's not the sender, send the message to them.\n\nSimilarly, for handlePrivateMessage:\n\n- Extract the recipient username and the message.\n\n- Find the client with that username.\n\n- If found, send the message to that client.\n\n- If not found, inform the sender that the recipient does not exist.\n\nI need to make sure that the message format is clear. For example, a private message could be \"/private username message\", and the server will parse \"username\" and \"message\" from it.\n\nI should also think about escaping spaces in usernames or messages, but for simplicity, let's assume that usernames don't contain spaces.\n\nSo, the format would be:\n\n- /private username message\n\nWhere \"username\" is a single word without spaces, and \"message\" can contain spaces.\n\nI need to split the message accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, for username registration:\n\n- /username desired_username\n\nAgain, assuming \"desired_username\" doesn't contain spaces.\n\nIn a more robust implementation, I'd allow usernames with spaces and messages with spaces, but for this basic version, this should suffice.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the notifyDisconnection method.\n\n- When a client disconnects, iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- Send a message to each client indicating that a particular user has left.\n\n- The message could be something like \"[username] has disconnected.\"\n\nAlso, when a new client connects and sets a username, the server should notify the other clients that a new user has joined.\n\nI can add another method to handle this.\n\n- When a client sets their username successfully, broadcast a message like \"[username] has joined the chat.\"\n\nThis will require modifying the handleUsername method to include this broadcast.\n\nI need to make sure that a client cannot set a username that's already taken.\n\nIn the handleUsername method, check if the username is already in use, and if so, inform the client to choose another username.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that each client sets a username before they can send messages.\n\nMaybe, disable message sending until the client has set a username.\n\nTo do this, I can set a flag in the Client object indicating whether the username has been set or not.\n\nIn the Client class, add a boolean field like \"isUsernameSet\" and set it to true once the username is set.\n\nIn the run method, before processing any messages, check if the client has set a username. If not, only accept \"/username\" commands.\n\nOnce the username is set, proceed to handle other messages.\n\nThis way, clients are forced to set a username before they can participate in the chat.\n\nNow, let's think about the message formats in more detail.\n\nFor broadcast messages, it's straightforward: the client just types the message and sends it.\n\nFor private messages, as mentioned, it's \"/private username message\".\n\nFor username registration, it's \"/username desired_username\".\n\nI need to make sure that the server correctly identifies these commands and processes them accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should consider implementing help or info messages for clients to understand the available commands.\n\nFor example, if a client sends \"/help\", the server could send back a list of available commands.\n\nBut for this basic version, I'll keep it simple and not implement additional commands beyond \"/username\" and \"/private\".\n\nNow, let's think about error handling.\n\n- If a client tries to send a private message to a nonexistent user, the server should inform the sender that the user does not exist.\n\n- If a client tries to set a username that's already taken, inform them to choose another username.\n\n- If there are issues with reading from or writing to sockets, handle the exceptions gracefully without crashing the server.\n\n- If a client disconnects unexpectedly, remove them from the list of clients and notify the other clients.\n\nI need to make sure that the server can handle multiple clients connecting and disconnecting concurrently without issues.\n\nUsing CopyOnWriteArrayList for the list of clients should help with thread safety, as it's designed for concurrent access.\n\nHowever, when iterating through the list to send messages, I need to handle the possibility that clients may be added or removed concurrently.\n\nCopyOnWriteArrayList creates a new array each time it's modified, which can be inefficient if there are many modifications, but for a chat server with a moderate number of clients, it should be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a synchronized list, but CopyOnWriteArrayList is easier to use in a read-heavy scenario, which is typical for a chat server.\n\nLet me consider implementing the broadcastMessage method.\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- For each client, if it's not the sender, get their PrintWriter and send the message.\n\n- Need to make sure that sending the message doesn't throw an exception; if it does, handle it appropriately.\n\nSimilarly, in handlePrivateMessage, find the recipient client and send the message to them.\n\nI need to make sure that the message is sent correctly and handle any exceptions that may occur during sending.\n\nAlso, I need to format the messages appropriately.\n\nFor example, broadcast messages could be prefixed with the sender's username, like \"[username] : message content\".\n\nPrivate messages could be sent directly without broadcasting.\n\nI should also think about how to handle large numbers of clients.\n\nEach client has their own thread, which could lead to performance issues if there are too many clients.\n\nIn a more advanced implementation, I could use non-blocking I/O or an ExecutorService to manage a pool of threads, but for this basic version, using one thread per client should be sufficient.\n\nAnother consideration is the termination of the server.\n\nIn the current setup, the server runs indefinitely, accepting connections in an infinite loop.\n\nTo shut down the server, I could add a shutdown command, but for simplicity, I'll assume that the server runs until it's manually stopped.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the notifyDisconnection method.\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- For each client, send a message indicating that the disconnected user has left.\n\n- Something like \"[username] has disconnected.\"\n\n- Need to make sure that the disconnected client is not sent this message, but since it's already removed, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlso, when a new client sets their username, broadcast a message to all other clients that a new user has joined.\n\n- Something like \"[username] has joined the chat.\"\n\nThis will require modifying the handleUsername method to include this broadcast.\n\nI need to ensure that the username is set before broadcasting the join message.\n\nLet me outline the steps in handleUsername:\n\n- Extract the desired username from the message.\n\n- Check if the username is already taken.\n\n- If it is, inform the client to choose another username.\n\n- If it's not taken, set the username for the client.\n\n- Set the isUsernameSet flag to true.\n\n- Broadcast to all other clients that this user has joined.\n\nI need to implement the broadcastJoin method for this.\n\nSimilarly, when a client disconnects, broadcast that they have left.\n\nI need to implement the broadcastLeave method.\n\nI should also think about how to handle messages from clients who haven't set a username yet.\n\nIn the run method, before the username is set, only accept \"/username\" commands.\n\nIf a client tries to send any other message before setting a username, inform them to set a username first.\n\nOnce the username is set, proceed to handle other messages.\n\nThis will prevent anonymous messages and ensure that all messages can be attributed to a specific user.\n\nLet me think about the message formats again.\n\n- \"/username desired_username\"\n\n- \"/private username message\"\n\n- Normal messages: any other text, which will be broadcasted.\n\nI need to make sure that the server correctly identifies these commands based on the message starting with \"/username\" or \"/private\".\n\nI should also handle cases where the command is misspelled or used incorrectly.\n\nFor example, if a client sends \"/private\", but doesn't specify a username or message, the server should inform them of the correct usage.\n\nSimilarly, for \"/username\", if no desired_username is provided, inform the client of the correct format.\n\nThis will require adding some validation in the handleUsername and handlePrivateMessage methods.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing the Client class.\n\n- It should have fields for the socket, username, and perhaps a flag indicating whether the username is set.\n\n- Maybe also include the input and output streams, but for now, I'll keep them in the ClientHandler class.\n\n- The Client class can be a simple POJO with getters and setters for the username.\n\nI need to ensure that the username is set only once, when the client first registers it.\n\nOnce set, it shouldn't be changed unless the client disconnects and reconnects.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that the username is set once at the beginning and remains the same for the duration of the connection.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the handlePrivateMessage method.\n\n- Extract the recipient username and the message.\n\n- Find the client with that username.\n\n- If found, send the message to that client.\n\n- If not found, inform the sender that the recipient does not exist.\n\nThe message format is \"/private username message\".\n\nI need to split the message into parts.\n\n- Split the message by spaces.\n\n- The first part should be \"/private\".\n\n- The second part should be the username.\n\n- The rest should be the message.\n\nSo, I can split the message into an array based on spaces.\n\nIf there are less than three parts, it's an invalid command.\n\nOtherwise, the second part is the username, and the rest is the message.\n\nI need to rebuild the message if it contains multiple words.\n\nFor example, if the message is \"/private user hello world\", then:\n\n- command = \"/private\"\n\n- recipient = \"user\"\n\n- message = \"hello world\"\n\nSo, I need to collect all parts after the second one as the message.\n\nIn code, I can do something like:\n\nString[] parts = message.split(\" \", 3);\n\nif (parts.length < 3) {\n\n// invalid command\n\n} else {\n\nString recipient = parts[1];\n\nString msg = parts[2];\n\n// find client by username and send message\n\n}\n\nThis way, even if the message contains spaces, it's captured correctly.\n\nSimilarly, for the \"/username\" command:\n\n- It should be \"/username desired_username\"\n\n- So, split by space once.\n\n- If parts.length < 2, invalid command.\n\n- Otherwise, parts[1] is the desired_username.\n\nI need to handle cases where the username contains spaces, but for now, I'll assume usernames don't contain spaces.\n\nIf needed, I can implement more sophisticated parsing later.\n\nNow, let's think about how to send messages to clients.\n\nEach client has a PrintWriter connected to their socket's output stream.\n\nSo, in the ClientHandler, I have a PrintWriter for sending messages to the connected client.\n\nTo send a message to a specific client, I need to get their PrintWriter and call println(message).\n\nFor broadcasting, I need to iterate through all clients and send the message to their respective PrintWriters, except for the sender.\n\nSimilarly, for private messages, find the recipient's PrintWriter and send the message to them.\n\nI need to make sure that sending messages doesn't block or throw exceptions.\n\nIf an exception occurs while sending a message to a client, it probably means that the client has disconnected, so I should remove them from the list of clients and notify the other clients.\n\nWait, but in the run method, when a client disconnects, it's already handled by the finally block.\n\nSo, perhaps I don't need to handle exceptions when sending messages, because if a client has disconnected, their socket will be closed, and sending to a closed socket will throw an exception.\n\nIn that case, I can catch the exception and remove the client accordingly.\n\nBut to avoid duplicating code, maybe I should have a separate method for sending messages to a client, which handles the exception and removes the client if necessary.\n\nThis way, I can reuse this method in both broadcast and private messaging.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\n- Create a method like sendMessageToClient(Client client, String message)\n\n- Try to send the message using the client's PrintWriter.\n\n- If an exception occurs, remove the client from the list and notify the other clients.\n\nBut in this approach, I need to make sure that the client is removed only once, and that the notification is sent only once, even if multiple sending operations fail.\n\nPerhaps, in the ClientHandler's run method, when reading messages, if an exception occurs, remove the client and notify the others.\n\nSimilarly, in the sendMessageToClient method, if sending fails, remove the client and notify the others.\n\nBut to avoid duplicate removal and notification, I need to synchronize access to the client list and ensure that these operations are atomic.\n\nThis could get complicated with multiple threads trying to send messages and handle disconnections.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to have the ClientHandler handle disconnections when reading from the client, and have the server's broadcasting and private messaging assume that the client list is valid at the time of sending.\n\nIf an exception occurs when sending to a client, it means the client has disconnected, so remove them.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps I can ignore exceptions when sending messages, assuming that the client has disconnected and will be removed when their thread exits.\n\nAlternatively, I can wrap the sending in a try-catch block and remove the client if an exception occurs.\n\nBut this might lead to redundant code.\n\nI need to find a balance between simplicity and robustness.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the initial approach: handle disconnections in the ClientHandler's run method, and assume that the client list is accurate when broadcasting or sending private messages.\n\nIf an exception occurs when sending a message, it will be caught in the finally block of the run method, and the client will be removed then.\n\nThis should suffice for a basic implementation.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the broadcastMessage method.\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- For each client, if it's not the sender, send the message using their PrintWriter.\n\n- The message should be formatted like \"[sender_username] : message_content\"\n\n- Assume that the sender's username is set at this point.\n\nSimilarly, for private messages, send the message directly to the recipient without broadcasting.\n\nThe private message should probably be prefixed with \"[private from sender_username] : message_content\"\n\nThis will make it clear to the recipient that it's a private message from a specific user.\n\nI need to implement this formatting to make the chat more readable.\n\nAlso, when a new client joins or leaves, broadcast a message indicating so, as mentioned earlier.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing the notifyDisconnection method.\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- For each client, send a message like \"[disconnected_username] has left the chat.\"\n\n- Make sure that the disconnected client is not sent this message, but since it's already removed, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSimilarly, when a client sets their username, broadcast a message like \"[username] has joined the chat.\"\n\nI need to make sure that the join message is sent only after the username is set successfully.\n\nAlso, I should think about how to handle multiple clients trying to set the same username.\n\nSince username checks are done in the handleUsername method, and it's synchronized, it should be okay.\n\nBut in a multi-threaded environment, there's a slight chance that two clients could set the same username if not properly synchronized.\n\nTo prevent this, I can synchronize access to the client list when checking and setting usernames.\n\nUsing CopyOnWriteArrayList should handle most concurrency issues, but to be safe, I can synchronize on a separate object.\n\nLet me introduce a lock object for synchronization.\n\n- private final Object lock = new Object();\n\nThen, in handleUsername:\n\n- synchronized (lock) {\n\n- check if username is taken\n\n- if not, set the username and broadcast join message\n\n- }\n\nThis ensures that only one thread can set a username at a time, preventing race conditions.\n\nSimilarly, in notifyDisconnection:\n\n- synchronized (lock) {\n\n- iterate through clients and send disconnection message\n\n- }\n\nThis will ensure that the client list isn't modified while iterating through it.\n\nWait, but CopyOnWriteArrayList is designed to be safe for concurrent access, so iterating through it without synchronization should be fine, as modifications create a new array.\n\nHowever, to be extra cautious, synchronizing access to the client list can prevent any potential issues.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the broadcastJoin and broadcastLeave methods.\n\n- broadcastJoin(String username):\n\n- Send a message to all clients: \"[username] has joined the chat.\"\n\n- broadcastLeave(String username):\n\n- Send a message to all clients: \"[username] has left the chat.\"\n\nThese methods will be similar to broadcastMessage, but with a specific message format.\n\nI can create a helper method for sending a message to all clients, and then use it in these methods.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\n- Create a method broadcast(String message):\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- For each client, send the message using their PrintWriter.\n\n- Then, in broadcastJoin and broadcastLeave, construct the appropriate message and call broadcast(message).\n\nWait, but in broadcastMessage, I need to exclude the sender, whereas in broadcastJoin and broadcastLeave, I need to send the message to all clients.\n\nSo, perhaps I need two methods:\n\n- broadcastToAll(String message): sends to all clients.\n\n- broadcastToOthers(String message, Client sender): sends to all clients except the sender.\n\nThen, use broadcastToAll for join and leave messages, and broadcastToOthers for regular messages.\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing these methods.\n\n- broadcastToAll(String message):\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- For each client, send the message using their PrintWriter.\n\n- broadcastToOthers(String message, Client sender):\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- For each client, if it's not the sender, send the message using their PrintWriter.\n\nThis way, I can reuse the code for sending messages to multiple clients.\n\nI need to make sure that sending messages doesn't block and that exceptions are handled appropriately.\n\nIn the broadcast methods, if sending to a client fails, I can remove that client from the list and notify the other clients.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps I can assume that sending failures are handled in the ClientHandler's run method, as discussed earlier.\n\nThis way, I don't need to handle exceptions in the broadcast methods.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing the handlePrivateMessage method.\n\n- Extract recipient username and message.\n\n- Find the client with that username.\n\n- If found, send the message to them.\n\n- If not found, inform the sender that the recipient does not exist.\n\nI need to implement a method to find a client by username.\n\n- Maybe a method getClientByUsername(String username):\n\n- Iterate through the list of clients.\n\n- Return the client with the matching username.\n\nSince usernames are unique, this should return at most one client.\n\nI need to make sure that usernames are case-sensitive or case-insensitive.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that usernames are case-sensitive.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the sender tries to send a private message to themselves.\n\nIn that case, perhaps just send the message back to themselves.\n\nOr, perhaps prevent them from sending private messages to themselves.\n\nI'll decide to allow sending messages to themselves, but it might not make much sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the message format for private messages.\n\nWhen sending a private message, the recipient should see that it's a private message from a specific user.\n\nSo, the message could be formatted like:\n\n\"[private from sender_username] : message_content\"\n\nThis way, the recipient knows that it's a private message from a particular sender.\n\nSimilarly, when the sender sends a private message, they should see the same format in their own chat window, so they know it's a private message they sent.\n\nI need to decide whether to echo the private message back to the sender or not.\n\nIn instant messaging systems, usually, the sender sees their own private messages in their chat window.\n\nSo, in this case, when sending a private message, I'll send the formatted message back to the sender as well.\n\nWait, but in this setup, the sender is sending the message to the recipient, and the server routes it to the recipient.\n\nThe sender shouldn't see the private message unless it's echoed back by the server.\n\nBut in typical chat applications, when you send a private message, you see it in your chat window as well.\n\nSo, perhaps the server should send the private message back to the sender, formatted appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, the client could display the private message locally, but in this simple server implementation, I'll have the server send the message back to the sender.\n\nThis way, the server handles all message routing, and the client just displays whatever messages it receives.\n\nThis simplifies the client implementation.\n\nSo, in handlePrivateMessage:\n\n- Find the recipient client.\n\n- If found, send the formatted private message to the recipient.\n\n- Also, send the same message back to the sender.\n\n- If not found, inform the sender that the recipient does not exist.\n\nThis way, the sender sees the private message in their chat window, just like messages sent to the general chat.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing the formatting for messages.\n\n- For broadcast messages:\n\n- Format: \"[sender_username] : message_content\"\n\n- For private messages:\n\n- Format: \"[private from sender_username] : message_content\"\n\nThis should make it clear who sent the message and whether it's a private message.\n\nI need to make sure that the sender's username is included in the message so that recipients know who it's from.\n\nIn private messages, it's especially important to indicate that it's a private communication.\n\nNow, let's think about error messages.\n\n- When a client tries to send a private message to a nonexistent user, the server should send an error message back to the sender, something like \"Error: User [username] not found.\"\n\n- When a client tries to set a username that's already taken, send an error message like \"Error: Username [username] is already taken. Please choose another.\"\n\n- When a client sends an invalid command, such as malformed \"/private\" or \"/username\" messages, send an error message explaining the correct usage.\n\nThese error messages should be sent back to the client who issued the invalid command.\n\nI need to make sure that error messages are clearly marked as errors, perhaps by starting with \"Error: \".\n\nThis will help clients distinguish between normal messages and error messages.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing the handleUsername method.\n\n- Extract the desired_username from the message.\n\n- Check if it's already taken.\n\n- If not, set it for the client and broadcast that the user has joined.\n\n- If it is taken, inform the client to choose another username.\n\nI need to make sure that the username is set only once per client.\n\nOnce set, it shouldn't be changed unless the client reconnects.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the username is set only once at the beginning.\n\nIf a client tries to change their username later, the server can ignore it or send an error message.\n\nTo enforce this, I can set a flag in the Client object indicating whether the username is already set.\n\nIn the Client class, add a boolean field like \"isUsernameSet\" and set it to true once the username is set.\n\nIn the handleUsername method, check if isUsernameSet is true. If it is, send an error message saying that the username is already set.\n\nThis prevents clients from changing their usernames during the session.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the client side.\n\nAlthough the task is to create the server, having a basic understanding of the client will help ensure that the server and client can communicate correctly.\n\nA simple chat client could be a command-line application that:\n\n- Connects to the server via a Socket.\n\n- In one thread, reads messages from the server and prints them to the console.\n\n- In another thread, reads user input from the console and sends messages to the server.\n\nFor the username setup, when the client connects, it might wait for a prompt from the server to set a username, then send the \"/username desired_username\" message.\n\nFor sending messages, the client would simply read lines from the console and send them to the server.\n\nFor private messages, the user would type \"/private username message\" and send it.\n\nThe server would then handle routing the message appropriately.\n\nI need to make sure that the client can handle messages from the server correctly,\u533a\u5206\u666e\u901a\u6d88\u606f\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u6765\u51b3\u5b9a\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4ee5\"Error: \"\u5f00\u5934\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6d88\u606f\u89c6\u4e3a\u666e\u901a\u804a\u5929\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u53d1\u9001\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u5f00\u59cb\u7f16\u5199\u5b9e\u9645\u7684Java\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u9762\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u521b\u5efa`ChatServer`\u7c7b\uff1a\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass ChatServer {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int port = 1234;\n        List<Client> clients = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());\n\n        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)) {\n            System.out.println(\"Server started on port \" + port);\n            while (true) {\n                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n                ClientHandler handler = new ClientHandler(clientSocket, clients);\n                new Thread(handler).start();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u521b\u5efa`ClientHandler`\u7c7b\uff1a\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\n\nclass ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n    private Socket socket;\n    private BufferedReader in;\n    private PrintWriter out;\n    private List<Client> clients;\n    private Client client;\n\n    public ClientHandler(Socket socket, List<Client> clients) {\n        this.socket = socket;\n        this.clients = clients;\n        try {\n            this.in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n            this.out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n            this.client = new Client(socket, null); // username to be set later\n            clients.add(client);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        String message;\n        try {\n            while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                if (!client.isUsernameSet()) {\n                    if (message.startsWith(\"/username\")) {\n                        handleUsername(message);\n                    } else {\n                        out.println(\"Error: Please set your username first using /username desired_username\");\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    if (message.startsWith(\"/private\")) {\n                        handlePrivateMessage(message);\n                    } else {\n                        broadcastMessage(message, client);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            clients.remove(client);\n            notifyDisconnection(client);\n            try {\n                socket.close();\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void handleUsername(String message) {\n        String[] parts = message.split(\" \", 2);\n        if (parts.length < 2) {\n            out.println(\"Error: Invalid username format.
