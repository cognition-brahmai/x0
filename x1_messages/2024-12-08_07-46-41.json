But then you put back 2 apples. So, adding those 2 apples back to the basket, that would make it 2 plus 2, which is 4 apples. So, there are 4 apples left in the basket.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. You start with 5 apples, take out 3, so that's 5 - 3 = 2 apples left. Then you put back 2 apples, so 2 + 2 = 4 apples. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of it as starting with 5 apples, then taking out 3 but putting back 2, which is like taking out only 1 apple in total because you took out 3 and put back 2. So, 5 - 1 = 4 apples. That matches the earlier result.\n\nI think both methods make sense, and they both lead to the same answer, which is 4 apples left in the basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
