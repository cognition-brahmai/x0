        "content": "In the realm where winds and waves conspire,\nStands a lighthouse, tall and dire.\nIts keeper, lonely, yearns for light,\nIn the darkness of his endless night.\n\nOne fateful eve, as stars took flight,\nHe saw a vision, pure and bright.\nA mermaid, dancing in the foam,\nHer song, a siren's haunting tone.\n\nHer eyes, like oceans deep and wide,\nHeld mysteries that couldn't hide.\nShe smiled at him, across the sea,\nA smile that set his heart free.\n\nEach night, he'd watch, his heart aflame,\nFor the mermaid, his secret flame.\nBut distance kept them worlds apart,\nTheir love, a tale of broken heart.\n\nHe'd call to her, across the waves,\nBut only echoes, his cries repaves.\nThe sea, a barrier, cold and vast,\nKeeps them apart, forever cast.\n\nHe carved her image, in wood and stone,\nEach sculpture, a love note thrown.\nInto the sea, they'd sail away,\nHop ing she'd find them some day.\n\nBut time, it flows like ocean's tide,\nAnd hope begins to fade inside.\nHis love, though true, remains unrequited,\nA sorrow, deeply, deeply, inflicted.\n\nNow, in his old age, frail and weak,\nHe still keeps watch, his vigils meek.\nFor the mermaid, his lost dream,\nIn the lighthouse's endless beam.\n\nSo here's to love, that conquers not,\nTo hearts that beat, though they're forgot.\nTo lighthouse keepers and mermaids fair,\nWhose love knows no boundaries, no repair.\n\nAnd though their tale ends in solitude,\nTheir love, a legend, never mute.\nA testament to love's pure might,\nEven in defeat, it shines so bright."
