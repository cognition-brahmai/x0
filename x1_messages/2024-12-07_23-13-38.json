        "content": "So I've got this problem here about marbles in a bag. It says that the ratio of red marbles to blue marbles is 3:7, and there are 30 red marbles. I need to find out how many blue marbles there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. In this case, it's comparing the number of red marbles to the number of blue marbles, and it's given as 3:7. That means for every 3 red marbles, there are 7 blue marbles.\n\nNow, I know there are 30 red marbles. I need to find the number of blue marbles that corresponds to these 30 red marbles, keeping the ratio of 3:7.\n\nOne way to approach this is to set up a proportion. A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal. So, I can write the ratio of red to blue marbles as 3:7, and the actual numbers as 30:b, where b is the number of blue marbles.\n\nSo, the proportion is:\n\n3/7 = 30/b\n\nNow, I need to solve for b.\n\nTo solve this proportion, I can cross-multiply.\n\n3 * b = 7 * 30\n\nThat gives:\n\n3b = 210\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for b:\n\nb = 210 / 3\n\nb = 70\n\nSo, there are 70 blue marbles.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 30 red marbles and 70 blue marbles, the total number of marbles is 30 + 70 = 100.\n\nThe ratio of red to blue is 30:70, which simplifies to 3:7 by dividing both numbers by 10. So, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio as parts. The ratio 3:7 means that there are 3 parts red and 7 parts blue, making a total of 3 + 7 = 10 parts.\n\nIf 3 parts correspond to 30 red marbles, then 1 part corresponds to 30 / 3 = 10 marbles.\n\nTherefore, 7 parts correspond to 7 * 10 = 70 blue marbles.\n\nAgain, that gives me 70 blue marbles.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think 70 is the correct number of blue marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
