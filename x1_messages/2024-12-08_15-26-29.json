        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual revenue of $1,200,000 and spends $800,000 on operating expenses. First, I need to find out what their net income is. Net income is usually calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue. So, net income would be $1,200,000 minus $800,000, which is $400,000.\n\nNow, the company pays out 25% of their net income as dividends to shareholders. To find out how much that is, I need to calculate 25% of $400,000. \n\n25% of $400,000 is calculated as 0.25 multiplied by $400,000, which equals $100,000.\n\nSo, the company pays out $100,000 in dividends to shareholders.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100000} \\]"
