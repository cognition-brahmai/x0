He was a civil rights leader who played a key role in the American Civil Rights Movement. In 1955, he led the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which was a protest against racial segregation on the public transit system in Montgomery, Alabama. His famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech was delivered during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., not at the New York Stock Exchange. Tragically, he was assassinated in 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nSource: [History.com - Martin Luther King Jr.](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955; \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963}} \\]"
