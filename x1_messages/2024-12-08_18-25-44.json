Every plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the provided functions. The input could be the user question, previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nBingSearch[input]: A tool that enables users to conduct information searches via Bing. It provides a list of potential sites that might contain answers to the user's query.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from one or multiple websites listed in the input string (newline separated links). The input consists of one or more links, and the output is plain text containing the content of these links.\nHyperlinkCollector[input]: Collects hyperlinks from plain text and generates a plain text, newline-separated list of links.\nLanguageProcessor[input]: A question-answering language model effective at answering queries based on a given text passage. The input should be a text-based question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, such as \"What is the dog's name, given :evidence1:?\"\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, potentially referencing prior evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0:\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: contains the final answer]\n\nQuestion: What is the population of Tokyo and what are some of its major landmarks?"
