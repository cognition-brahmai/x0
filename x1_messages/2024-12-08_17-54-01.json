        "content": "Let's see. I read 5 pages of a book every day, and the book has 150 pages. I need to find out how many days it takes to read the entire book and then add the 3 days it takes to write a report.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many days it takes to read the book. Since I read 5 pages each day, I can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages I read per day.\n\nSo, total pages divided by pages per day:\n\n150 pages \u00f7 5 pages/day = 30 days\n\nThat means it takes me 30 days to read the book.\n\nNext, I need to add the 3 days it takes to write the report.\n\nTotal days = days to read the book + days to write the report\n\nTotal days = 30 days + 3 days = 33 days\n\nSo, it takes a total of 33 days to read the book and write the report.\n\nWait a minute, is there any overlap or something I'm missing? Does writing the report start only after I finish reading the book? If that's the case, then the 3 days are added after the 30 days of reading.\n\nAlternatively, if I start writing the report while still reading the book, it might be different. But the problem says \"after reading the book, you write a report that takes 3 days.\" So, it seems like writing the report comes after finishing the book.\n\nTherefore, the total time is indeed 30 days for reading plus 3 days for writing, which equals 33 days.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]"
