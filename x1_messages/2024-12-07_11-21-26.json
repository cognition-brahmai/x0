        "content": "So I've got this problem here about estimating the water demand for a new water treatment plant. The plant is being built to process 100 million gallons of water per day, and it's going to take three years to complete. The construction budget is $250 million, but I don't think that's relevant for this particular question. The main thing is that the city's population is expected to grow at an average rate of 2% per year during these three years, and I need to estimate how much water will need to be processed daily once the plant is operational, considering this population growth.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like I have to project the water demand based on the population growth over the next three years. The plant is being built to handle 100 million gallons per day, but with population growth, the demand might be higher by the time the plant is finished. So, I need to calculate the expected water demand at the end of three years, taking into account the 2% annual population growth.\n\nTo do this, I should probably start by figuring out how much the population will increase over the three years. If the population is growing at 2% per year, I can use the formula for exponential growth to find the population at the end of the three years.\n\nThe formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the future population\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate (expressed as a decimal)\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time in years\n\nIn this case, \\( r = 0.02 \\) (since it's 2% per year), and \\( t = 3 \\) years.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give me the current population. Hmm. That seems like a problem because without knowing the initial population, I can't calculate the future population.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Estimate the amount of water that needs to be processed daily once the plant becomes operational, taking into account the increased demand due to population growth.\"\n\nIt says that the plant is being constructed with a capacity of processing 100 million gallons of water per day. Is this capacity based on the current water demand, or is it already accounting for some future growth?\n\nThe problem mentions that the project will take three years to complete, and during this period, the population is expected to grow at an average rate of 2% per year. So, it's likely that the current water demand is less than 100 million gallons per day, and the plant is being built to handle both the current demand and the expected growth over the next three years.\n\nBut without knowing the current population or the current water demand, it's tricky to directly calculate the future water demand.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can assume that the current water demand is less than 100 million gallons per day, and the plant is being built to handle the demand three years from now, after accounting for the population growth.\n\nIf that's the case, then the 100 million gallons per day is designed to meet the water demand at the end of the three-year construction period.\n\nBut the question is asking me to estimate the amount of water that needs to be processed daily once the plant becomes operational, taking into account the increased demand due to population growth.\n\nSo, it seems like I need to calculate the water demand at the end of three years, considering the 2% annual population growth, and that should be the amount the plant needs to process daily.\n\nBut I still don't know the current population or the current water demand. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of the increase in population over three years and then estimate the corresponding increase in water demand.\n\nLet's see, if the population grows at 2% per year, then over three years, the population will increase by:\n\nYear 1: \\( P_0 \\times 0.02 \\)\n\nYear 2: \\( P_0 \\times (1 + 0.02) \\times 0.02 = P_0 \\times 0.0212 \\)\n\nYear 3: \\( P_0 \\times (1 + 0.02)^2 \\times 0.02 \\approx P_0 \\times 0.0224 \\)\n\nBut this seems complicated, and I'm still stuck because I don't know \\( P_0 \\).\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the total growth factor over three years.\n\nThe growth factor per year is 1.02 (since it's 2% growth).\n\nSo, over three years, the population will be multiplied by \\( (1.02)^3 \\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\( (1.02)^3 = 1.02 \\times 1.02 \\times 1.02 \\approx 1.0612 \\)\n\nSo, the population will be approximately 6.12% higher after three years.\n\nTherefore, the water demand will also be approximately 6.12% higher, assuming that water usage per capita remains constant.\n\nNow, if the plant is being built to handle 100 million gallons per day, and that's intended to meet the future demand, then the current water demand must be lower than that.\n\nLet me denote the current water demand as \\( D \\) million gallons per day.\n\nThen, the future water demand, after three years, would be \\( D \\times 1.0612 \\) million gallons per day.\n\nBut the plant is being built to handle 100 million gallons per day, which should be equal to the future water demand.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( D \\times 1.0612 = 100 \\)\n\nFrom this, I can solve for \\( D \\):\n\n\\( D = \\frac{100}{1.0612} \\approx 94.23 \\) million gallons per day.\n\nSo, the current water demand is approximately 94.23 million gallons per day.\n\nBut the question is asking for the water demand once the plant becomes operational, which is the future demand, after three years.\n\nSince the future demand is 100 million gallons per day, as per the plant's capacity, maybe the answer is simply 100 million gallons per day.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's what the question is getting at.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me consider that the plant is being built to handle the water demand three years from now, accounting for the population growth during that period.\n\nIf the plant will process 100 million gallons per day once it's operational, and that's supposed to meet the demand at that time, then the amount of water that needs to be processed daily once the plant becomes operational is 100 million gallons per day.\n\nBut the question is asking to estimate that amount, taking into account the increased demand due to population growth.\n\nSo, maybe it's expecting me to calculate the future demand based on the population growth rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plant's capacity is based on current demand, and I need to project the future demand beyond that.\n\nBut the problem states that the plant is being constructed with a capacity of processing 100 million gallons of water per day, and it's taking three years to complete. During this period, the population is expected to grow at 2% per year. So, it's logical to assume that the plant's capacity is designed to meet the water demand at the end of the three-year construction period, accounting for the population growth.\n\nIn that case, the amount of water that needs to be processed daily once the plant becomes operational would indeed be 100 million gallons per day, as that's what the plant is being built to handle.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking me to verify that or to calculate it independently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plant is being built to handle the current demand, and I need to estimate the future demand based on population growth.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if the plant is being built to handle the current demand, then it wouldn't account for the growth over the three years.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is that the plant's capacity of 100 million gallons per day is designed to meet the water demand at the end of the three-year construction period, after accounting for the population growth.\n\nTherefore, once the plant becomes operational, it will need to process 100 million gallons per day to meet the increased demand due to population growth.\n\nSo, the answer should be 100 million gallons per day.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting me to show the calculation behind this.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current water demand as \\( D \\) million gallons per day.\n\nThe population is growing at 2% per year, so the water demand is also expected to grow at the same rate, assuming per capita water usage remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the water demand after three years, \\( D_{\\text{future}} \\), can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ D_{\\text{future}} = D \\times (1 + 0.02)^3 \\]\n\nWe know that the plant is being built to handle \\( D_{\\text{future}} = 100 \\) million gallons per day.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 100 = D \\times (1.02)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{100}{1.02^3} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 1.02^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.02^3 = 1.061208 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{100}{1.061208} \\approx 94.23 \\] million gallons per day.\n\nSo, the current water demand is approximately 94.23 million gallons per day.\n\nBut again, the question is asking for the water demand once the plant becomes operational, which should be the future demand, i.e., 100 million gallons per day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking me to estimate the water demand after the three years, considering the population growth, and see if it matches the plant's capacity.\n\nIn that case, if the current demand is 94.23 million gallons per day, and it grows by 2% per year for three years, then the future demand would be:\n\n\\[ D_{\\text{future}} = 94.23 \\times (1.02)^3 \\approx 94.23 \\times 1.061208 \\approx 100 \\] million gallons per day.\n\nThis confirms that the plant's capacity is designed to meet the future demand.\n\nTherefore, the amount of water that needs to be processed daily once the plant becomes operational is 100 million gallons per day.\n\nBut maybe the question is expecting me to consider that the plant will need to process more than 100 million gallons per day because of the population growth during the construction period.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because the plant is being built to handle the future demand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in my approach.\n\nLet me try another angle.\n\nSuppose the current population is \\( P_0 \\), and the current water demand is \\( D_0 \\) million gallons per day.\n\nAssuming that water usage is directly proportional to population, then \\( D_0 = k \\times P_0 \\), where \\( k \\) is the per capita water usage.\n\nAfter three years, the population will be \\( P_3 = P_0 \\times (1.02)^3 \\), and the water demand will be \\( D_3 = k \\times P_3 = k \\times P_0 \\times (1.02)^3 = D_0 \\times (1.02)^3 \\).\n\nThe plant is being built to handle \\( D_3 = 100 \\) million gallons per day.\n\nSo, \\( D_3 = D_0 \\times 1.061208 = 100 \\), which gives \\( D_0 = \\frac{100}{1.061208} \\approx 94.23 \\) million gallons per day.\n\nBut again, the question is about the demand once the plant is operational, which should be \\( D_3 = 100 \\) million gallons per day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the water demand at the end of three years, considering the population growth, and to see if the plant's capacity is sufficient.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be that the plant needs to process 100 million gallons per day to meet the increased demand due to population growth.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking me to calculate the additional water demand due to population growth over the three years and add that to the current demand to get the future demand.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nAdditional demand = current demand \u00d7 (growth factor - 1)\n\nWhere growth factor = \\( (1.02)^3 \\approx 1.061208 \\)\n\nSo, additional demand = \\( D_0 \\times (1.061208 - 1) = D_0 \\times 0.061208 \\)\n\nBut without knowing \\( D_0 \\), this approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the plant's capacity is designed to meet the future demand, and therefore, the future demand is 100 million gallons per day.\n\nIn that case, there's no need for further calculation; the answer is simply 100 million gallons per day.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The simplest interpretation is that the plant is being built to handle the water demand three years from now, accounting for population growth, and that demand is 100 million gallons per day.\n\nTherefore, the amount of water that needs to be processed daily once the plant becomes operational is 100 million gallons per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100\\ \\text{million gallons per day}} \\]"
