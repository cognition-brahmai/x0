        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that cranks out 1200 items every day. Unfortunately, due to a malfunction, 3% of these items are defective. The factory runs for 25 days, and we need to find out how many non-defective items are produced during this time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have the daily production rate and the defect rate, and the factory operates for a certain number of days. So, to find the total non-defective items, I should probably calculate the total production over 25 days and then subtract the defective items from that total.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total production over 25 days. Since the factory produces 1200 items per day, over 25 days it would produce:\n\nTotal production = 1200 items/day * 25 days\n\nNow, I need to calculate that:\n\n1200 * 25 = Let's see, 1200 times 20 is 24,000, and 1200 times 5 is 6,000. So, 24,000 + 6,000 = 30,000 items.\n\nSo, the total production over 25 days is 30,000 items.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these are defective. The defect rate is 3%. So, defective items = 3% of total production.\n\nTo find 3% of 30,000, I can calculate:\n\nDefective items = (3/100) * 30,000\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFirst, 3 divided by 100 is 0.03.\n\nThen, 0.03 multiplied by 30,000 is:\n\n0.03 * 30,000 = 900 items.\n\nSo, there are 900 defective items produced over 25 days.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-defective items, I subtract the defective items from the total production:\n\nNon-defective items = total production - defective items\n\nNon-defective items = 30,000 - 900 = 29,100 items.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, daily production is 1200 items.\n\nOver 25 days, total production is 1200 * 25.\n\n1200 * 25:\n\n12 * 25 = 300, and since 1200 is 12 * 100, then 300 * 100 = 30,000. So, total production is indeed 30,000 items.\n\nDefect rate is 3%, so defective items are 3% of 30,000.\n\n3% of 30,000 is (3/100)*30,000 = 0.03 * 30,000 = 900 items.\n\nSubtracting defective items from total production: 30,000 - 900 = 29,100 non-defective items.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it this way: if 3% are defective, then 97% are non-defective.\n\nSo, non-defective items = 97% of total production.\n\nLet's calculate that to verify:\n\nNon-defective items = (97/100) * 30,000\n\nWhich is 0.97 * 30,000.\n\n0.97 * 30,000 = 29,100 items.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nIf the factory produces 1200 items per day with 3% defective, then daily non-defective production is 97% of 1200.\n\nSo, daily non-defective items = 0.97 * 1200 = 1,164 items.\n\nOver 25 days, total non-defective items = 1,164 * 25.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n1,164 * 25.\n\nWell, 1,000 * 25 = 25,000\n\n164 * 25 = 4,100\n\nSo, 25,000 + 4,100 = 29,100 items.\n\nAgain, this matches my previous calculations.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-defective items produced over 25 days is 29,100.\n\nI think that's the final answer, but let me just make sure there aren't any other factors to consider.\n\nIs there any possibility that the defect rate changes over time or anything like that? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I assume the defect rate is constant at 3%.\n\nAlso, the factory operates for 25 days, and it's producing 1200 items each day, so the total production is indeed 30,000 items.\n\nSubtracting the defective items, which are 3% of that, gives us 29,100 non-defective items.\n\nAlternatively, calculating 97% of 30,000 directly also gives 29,100.\n\nOr calculating daily non-defective production and multiplying by 25 gives the same result.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 29,100 non-defective items over 25 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{29100} \\]"
