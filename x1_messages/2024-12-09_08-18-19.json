        "content": "Let's see. So, if a bacteria population doubles every hour, and we want to know how many times larger it will be after one day compared to its initial size, we need to figure out how much it grows in 24 hours since one day has 24 hours.\n\nGiven that it doubles every hour, that means every hour the population is multiplied by 2. So, after one hour, it's 2 times the initial amount. After two hours, it's 2 times 2, which is 4 times the initial amount. After three hours, it's 2 times 4, which is 8 times the initial amount, and so on.\n\nThis seems like an exponential growth problem, where the population at any time is the initial population multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the number of hours.\n\nSo, mathematically, if we let P be the initial population, then after t hours, the population P(t) is P times 2 to the power of t, or P(t) = P * 2^t.\n\nIn this case, t is 24 hours, since we're looking at one day.\n\nTherefore, P(24) = P * 2^24.\n\nNow, we need to calculate 2^24 to find out how many times larger the population is after 24 hours.\n\nLet me calculate 2^24.\n\n2^10 is 1024.\n\n2^20 is (2^10)^2, which is 1024 squared.\n\n1024 squared is 1,048,576.\n\nThen, 2^24 is 2^20 times 2^4, which is 1,048,576 times 16.\n\n1,048,576 times 16 is 16,777,216.\n\nSo, 2^24 equals 16,777,216.\n\nTherefore, the bacteria population will be 16,777,216 times larger after one day compared to its initial size.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: since the population doubles every hour, after 24 hours, it would have doubled 24 times.\n\nEach doubling multiplies the population by 2, so it's 2 multiplied by itself 24 times, which is indeed 2^24.\n\nAnd 2^24 is 16,777,216.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can verify this by calculating it step by step for a few hours and then generalize.\n\nFor example:\n\n- After 1 hour: P * 2\n\n- After 2 hours: P * 2 * 2 = P * 4\n\n- After 3 hours: P * 2 * 2 * 2 = P * 8\n\n- After 4 hours: P * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = P * 16\n\nAnd so on, up to 24 hours: P * 2^24 = P * 16,777,216.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the growth rate. The population is growing exponentially with a base of 2 every hour.\n\nSo, in general, for exponential growth, the formula is P(t) = P * e^(rt), where r is the growth rate.\n\nBut in this case, since it's doubling every hour, it's more straightforward to use P(t) = P * 2^(t/t_double), where t_double is the doubling time, which is 1 hour here.\n\nTherefore, P(t) = P * 2^(t/1) = P * 2^t.\n\nAgain, for t=24, P(24) = P * 2^24 = P * 16,777,216.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to think in terms of percentages, the population is increasing by 100% every hour, since it's doubling.\n\nSo, each hour, the population adds another 100% of itself.\n\nOver 24 hours, that would be (1 + 1)^24 = 2^24, which again is 16,777,216 times the initial population.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the number of bacteria.\n\nSuppose we start with 1 bacterium.\n\nAfter 1 hour: 2 bacteria.\n\nAfter 2 hours: 4 bacteria.\n\nAfter 3 hours: 8 bacteria.\n\n...\n\nAfter 24 hours: 2^24 bacteria, which is 16,777,216 bacteria.\n\nSo, compared to the initial 1 bacterium, it's 16,777,216 times larger.\n\nAlternatively, if we start with P bacteria, after 24 hours, it's P * 16,777,216 bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the population is 16,777,216 times larger after one day.\n\nWait, but is there any other factor to consider? For example, is there a limit to how much the population can grow, like resources or space?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any constraints, so we can assume unlimited growth for this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the calculation stands: the population is 16,777,216 times larger after one day.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express this in terms of powers of 2, it's 2^24 times larger.\n\nBut the problem asks for how many times larger, so 16,777,216 times larger is the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider logarithms.\n\nIf we take the logarithm of the final population over the initial population, log(P(24)/P) = log(2^24) = 24 * log(2).\n\nBut since we're looking for the multiple, not the logarithm, this approach isn't necessary here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the bacteria population will be 16,777,216 times larger after one day compared to its initial size.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16777216} \\]"
