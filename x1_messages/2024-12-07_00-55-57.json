        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are 5 houses in a row, each a different color: green, white, red, blue, and yellow. I need to figure out the order based on the clues given.\n\nFirst clue: The green house is next to the white house. So, green and white are adjacent.\n\nSecond clue: The red house is not at either end of the row. So, red can't be first or fifth.\n\nThird clue: The blue house is between the yellow and green houses. So, blue is next to both yellow and green.\n\nLet me try to arrange them step by step.\n\nFrom the third clue, blue is between yellow and green. So, the order must be yellow-blue-green or green-blue-yellow.\n\nBut from the first clue, green is next to white. So, if it's yellow-blue-green, then white must be next to green, which would make the sequence yellow-blue-green-white or white-yellow-blue-green, but white-yellow-blue-green doesn't make sense because blue is supposed to be between yellow and green.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nIf it's yellow-blue-green, and green is next to white, then it must be yellow-blue-green-white.\n\nAlternatively, if it's green-blue-yellow, and green is next to white, then white must be on the other side of green, so white-green-blue-yellow.\n\nBut the third clue says blue is between yellow and green, so it must be yellow-blue-green or green-blue-yellow.\n\nNow, considering the first option: yellow-blue-green-white.\n\nBut then, what about the red house? It can't be at either end, so it can't be first or fifth.\n\nIn this arrangement, yellow is first, which would be okay because it's not red. White is fourth, red can't be fifth, so red must be second or third.\n\nSo, if yellow is first, blue is second, green is third, white is fourth, and red is fifth. But red can't be fifth, so this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if it's yellow-blue-green-white, and red has to be third, but green is already third in this arrangement. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the other arrangement: green-blue-yellow.\n\nSo, green-blue-yellow.\n\nFrom the first clue, green is next to white, so white must be on the other side of green, meaning white-green-blue-yellow.\n\nNow, red can't be at either end, so red can't be first or fifth.\n\nIn this arrangement, white is first, which is not red, good.\n\nThen green is second, blue is third, yellow is fourth.\n\nSo, the fifth house must be red.\n\nBut red can't be at either end, and in this arrangement, red is fifth, which is an end, so that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, seems like both initial arrangements lead to problems.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the positions step by step.\n\nLet's label the positions from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nClue 1: Green is next to white, so they are either 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.\n\nClue 2: Red is not at either end, so red is only in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nClue 3: Blue is between yellow and green, meaning that the sequence is yellow-blue-green or green-blue-yellow.\n\nSo, possible sequences are:\n\n- Yellow-blue-green\n\n- Green-blue-yellow\n\nLet's consider the first sequence: yellow-blue-green.\n\nIn this sequence, yellow is before blue, which is before green.\n\nIf this sequence occupies positions 1-2-3, then the fourth and fifth houses are white and red, but green is third, and it's next to white, so white would have to be fourth.\n\nSo, positions: 1-yellow, 2-blue, 3-green, 4-white, 5-red.\n\nBut red is fifth, which is an end, which violates clue 2.\n\nSo, this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence is in positions 2-3-4: blue is in position 3, which is allowed for red, but red can't be in position 3 because blue is in position 3.\n\nWait, blue is in position 3, which is not red, so red must be in position 2 or 4.\n\nBut in this sequence, positions 2-3-4 are yellow-blue-green, so position 2 is yellow, position 3 is blue, position 4 is green.\n\nThen position 1 could be white, and position 5 is red.\n\nSo, arrangement: 1-white, 2-yellow, 3-blue, 4-green, 5-red.\n\nNow, check the clues.\n\nClue 1: Green is next to white? Green is in 4, white is in 1. No, they are not next to each other.\n\nSo, this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence is in positions 3-4-5: green-blue-yellow.\n\nThen positions 3-green, 4-blue, 5-yellow.\n\nPosition 2 could be white, and position 1 could be red.\n\nArrangement: 1-red, 2-white, 3-green, 4-blue, 5-yellow.\n\nCheck clues.\n\nClue 1: Green is next to white? Green is in 3, white is in 2. Yes.\n\nClue 2: Red is not at either end. Red is in position 1, which is an end. Violates clue 2.\n\nSo, doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence is in positions 2-3-4: yellow-blue-green.\n\nThen positions 2-yellow, 3-blue, 4-green.\n\nPosition 1 could be white, and position 5 could be red.\n\nArrangement: 1-white, 2-yellow, 3-blue, 4-green, 5-red.\n\nBut again, green and white are not next to each other in this arrangement.\n\nWait, in this arrangement, green is in 4, white is in 1. They are not next to each other.\n\nSo, doesn't satisfy clue 1.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that green is next to white in another way.\n\nLet's consider the other sequence: green-blue-yellow.\n\nIf this sequence is in positions 1-2-3: green in 1, blue in 2, yellow in 3.\n\nThen position 4 could be white, and position 5 could be red.\n\nArrangement: 1-green, 2-blue, 3-yellow, 4-white, 5-red.\n\nCheck clues.\n\nClue 1: Green is next to white? Green is in 1, white is in 4. No.\n\nDoesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence is in positions 2-3-4: green-blue-yellow.\n\nThen positions 2-green, 3-blue, 4-yellow.\n\nPosition 1 could be white, and position 5 could be red.\n\nArrangement: 1-white, 2-green, 3-blue, 4-yellow, 5-red.\n\nCheck clues.\n\nClue 1: Green is next to white? Green is in 2, white is in 1. Yes.\n\nClue 2: Red is not at either end. Red is in 5, which is an end. Violates clue 2.\n\nSo, doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence is in positions 3-4-5: green-blue-yellow.\n\nPositions 3-green, 4-blue, 5-yellow.\n\nPosition 2 could be white, and position 1 could be red.\n\nArrangement: 1-red, 2-white, 3-green, 4-blue, 5-yellow.\n\nCheck clues.\n\nClue 1: Green is next to white? Green is in 3, white is in 2. Yes.\n\nClue 2: Red is not at either end. Red is in 1, which is an end. Violates clue 2.\n\nDoesn't work.\n\nSeems like all these arrangements are leading to violations.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that green and white can be in reverse order in the sequences.\n\nWait, earlier I considered yellow-blue-green and green-blue-yellow.\n\nBut perhaps white can be next to green in either direction.\n\nLet me try rearranging.\n\nSuppose green is in position 2, blue in 3, yellow in 4, white in 1, and red in 5.\n\nBut red is at the end, which is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, green in 3, blue in 4, yellow in 5, white in 2, red in 1.\n\nBut red is at the end again.\n\nWait, red can't be at either end.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me try to place red in position 2.\n\nWait, but in the sequence yellow-blue-green, red can't be in position 2 because blue is in position 2 in that sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps red is in position 3, which is blue's position, but blue can't be red.\n\nWait, no, each house is a different color.\n\nSo, red can't be in position where blue is.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to list all possible positions for each house.\n\nFirst, red can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nGreen is next to white, so green and white are adjacent.\n\nBlue is between yellow and green, so blue is next to both yellow and green.\n\nLet me try to place red in position 2.\n\nIf red is in 2, then what's around it can't be blue, since blue is between yellow and green.\n\nSo, positions 1 and 3 can't be blue.\n\nWait, but blue has to be between yellow and green.\n\nSo, if red is in 2, then perhaps yellow is in 1, blue in 3, green in 4, white in 5.\n\nWait, but then blue is between yellow and green, which is satisfied.\n\nRed is in 2, which is not an end.\n\nGreen is next to white? Green is in 4, white is in 5. Yes, they are adjacent.\n\nSo, this arrangement works.\n\nArrangement: 1-yellow, 2-red, 3-blue, 4-green, 5-white.\n\nCheck clues.\n\nClue 1: Green is next to white? Yes, positions 4 and 5.\n\nClue 2: Red is not at either end. Yes, it's in position 2.\n\nClue 3: Blue is between yellow and green. Yes, yellow in 1, blue in 3, green in 4.\n\nSo, this seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the house on the far left is yellow.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the color of the house on the far left.\n\nIn this arrangement, it's yellow.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was white or red, but this seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, is there another possible arrangement?\n\nLet me check.\n\nSuppose red is in position 3.\n\nThen, blue can't be in position 3, since red is there.\n\nWait, but blue has to be between yellow and green.\n\nSo, if red is in 3, then yellow and green must be on either side of blue, but blue is not in 3.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting.\n\nSo, perhaps the only possible arrangement is the one I found: yellow-red-blue-green-white.\n\nTherefore, the house on the far left is yellow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{yellow}} \\]"
