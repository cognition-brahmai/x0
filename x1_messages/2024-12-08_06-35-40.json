Each plan will be associated with an evidence value which is the output from one of the functions given an input string that can be the user question, previous evidence values or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nGoogleSearch[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using Google. This tool helps in finding sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Load websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nKnowledgeModel[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some famous works by the author who wrote \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"?"
