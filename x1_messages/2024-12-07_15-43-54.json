        "content": "So if I have a bottle that holds 2 liters of water, and I pour out half of its contents, how much water is left in the bottle? Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a bottle with 2 liters of water in it. When I pour out half of the contents, I'm removing half of the water that's inside. So, I need to find out how much water remains after that.\n\nOkay, so starting amount is 2 liters. Half of that is being poured out. To find half of 2 liters, I can divide 2 by 2, which equals 1 liter. So, I'm pouring out 1 liter.\n\nNow, to find out how much is left, I subtract the amount poured out from the starting amount. That is 2 liters minus 1 liter, which equals 1 liter.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can consider that pouring out half leaves half behind. So, if I have 2 liters and I'm leaving half, then the remaining amount should be half of 2 liters, which is again 1 liter.\n\nLet me check this with fractions to make sure. 2 liters can be written as 2 L. Half of that is (1/2) * 2 L = 1 L. So, that matches my previous thought.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of percentages, half is 50%. So, pouring out 50% of the contents means 50% of 2 liters is poured out, which is 1 liter, leaving behind 1 liter.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use decimals. Half is 0.5, so 0.5 * 2 liters = 1 liter poured out, leaving 1 liter behind.\n\nI think I'm consistent in all these methods. So, no matter how I approach it, the answer seems to be 1 liter.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any trick here or if I'm missing something. Is there any possibility that the bottle's capacity affects the remaining water after pouring out half? Wait, the bottle holds 2 liters, but is it completely full? The question says \"a bottle holds 2 liters of water,\" which likely means it's filled with 2 liters. If it were only partially filled, the amount poured out would be half of the actual contents, not necessarily half of the capacity. But given the phrasing, I think it's safe to assume that the bottle is full with 2 liters.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any residue or if the pouring is exact, but the question seems straightforward, assuming that pouring out half means exactly half is removed.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you pour out half of the contents of a 2-liter bottle, you're removing 1 liter, leaving 1 liter behind.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ liter}} \\]"
