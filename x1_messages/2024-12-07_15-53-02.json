        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! So, you need a JavaScript function that sorts an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them. It has a time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it efficient for sorting large arrays.\n\nI'll write a function called `mergeSort` that takes an array as input and returns a new array that's sorted in ascending order. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the array has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so we can return it as is.\n\n2. **Divide**: Find the middle index of the array and divide it into two subarrays: left and right.\n\n3. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the left and right subarrays using the merge sort function.\n\n4. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted subarrays back into a single sorted array.\n\nTo merge the subarrays, I'll use a helper function called `merge` that takes two sorted arrays and combines them into one sorted array.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction mergeSort(arr) {\n    // Base case: if the array has one or zero elements, it's already sorted\n    if (arr.length <= 1) {\n        return arr;\n    }\n\n    // Divide: find the middle index and split the array into left and right halves\n    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);\n    const left = arr.slice(0, mid);\n    const right = arr.slice(mid);\n\n    // Conquer: recursively sort the left and right halves\n    const sortedLeft = mergeSort(left);\n    const sortedRight = mergeSort(right);\n\n    // Combine: merge the two sorted halves\n    return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);\n}\n\nfunction merge(left, right) {\n    const merged = [];\n    let leftIndex = 0;\n    let rightIndex = 0;\n\n    // Merge the two arrays by comparing elements from each array\n    while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {\n        if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {\n            merged.push(left[leftIndex]);\n            leftIndex++;\n        } else {\n            merged.push(right[rightIndex]);\n            rightIndex++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If there are remaining elements in left or right, add them to the merged array\n    return merged.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst unsortedArray = [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62];\nconst sortedArray = mergeSort(unsortedArray);\nconsole.log(sortedArray); // Output: [5, 7, 23, 32, 34, 62]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `mergeSort` function is the main function that implements the merge sort algorithm.\n\n- The `merge` function is a helper function that merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.\n\n- We use recursion to divide the array into smaller subarrays until we reach arrays of size one or zero, which are inherently sorted.\n\n- Then, we merge these sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.\n\nThis implementation should work for arrays of any size, as long as they contain integers.
