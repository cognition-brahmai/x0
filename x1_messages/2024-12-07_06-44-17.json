The company spends 60% on production costs, 20% on marketing, and 10% on salaries. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much is spent on each category:\n\n1. **Production Costs:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Production Costs} = 60\\% \\text{ of } \\$2,000,000 = 0.60 \\times 2,000,000 = \\$1,200,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Marketing:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marketing} = 20\\% \\text{ of } \\$2,000,000 = 0.20 \\times 2,000,000 = \\$400,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Salaries:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Salaries} = 10\\% \\text{ of } \\$2,000,000 = 0.10 \\times 2,000,000 = \\$200,000\n   \\]\n\nNext, we'll sum up these expenses to find the total expenses:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Expenses} = \\$1,200,000 + \\$400,000 + \\$200,000 = \\$1,800,000\n   \\]\n\nNow, we'll subtract the total expenses from the annual revenue to find the net income:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Income} = \\$2,000,000 - \\$1,800,000 = \\$200,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the company's net income after accounting for production costs, marketing, and salaries is \\$200,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200000} \\]"
