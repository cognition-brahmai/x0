        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple REST API using Node.js and Express to manage a collection of books. I'll keep it straightforward since I need to handle basic CRUD operations: creating, reading, updating, and deleting books. And since I'm supposed to use an in-memory data structure, I won't be setting up a database; instead, I'll store the books in an array.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a new Node.js project. I'll create a new directory for my project and initialize it with npm.\n\n```bash\nmkdir book-api\ncd book-api\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nNext, I'll install Express, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that will help me set up the server and handle HTTP requests.\n\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\nNow, I'll create a new file called `app.js` where I'll write my server code.\n\nIn `app.js`, I'll start by requiring Express and creating an instance of the Express application.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis sets up a basic server that listens on port 3000.\n\nSince I'll be handling JSON data, I need to parse the request bodies. I can use Express's `express.json()` middleware for that.\n\n```javascript\napp.use(express.json());\n```\n\nNow, I need to create an in-memory data structure to store the books. I'll use an array, and to simulate a unique ID for each book, I'll assign an incremental ID to each new book.\n\n```javascript\nlet books = [];\nlet idCounter = 1;\n```\n\nLet's define the endpoints one by one.\n\n**1. Adding a book**\n\nI need an endpoint to add a new book. This will be a POST request to `/books`. The book data will include title, author, and publication year.\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title, author, publicationYear } = req.body;\n  if (!title || !author || !publicationYear) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });\n  }\n  const newBook = {\n    id: idCounter++,\n    title,\n    author,\n    publicationYear\n  };\n  books.push(newBook);\n  res.status(201).json(newBook);\n});\n```\n\nHere, I'm checking if all required fields are present in the request body. If not, I return a 400 Bad Request error. Otherwise, I create a new book object with an assigned ID and add it to the `books` array. I also return the newly created book with a 201 Created status.\n\n**2. Retrieving all books**\n\nFor getting all books, I'll set up a GET endpoint at `/books`.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(books);\n});\n```\n\nThis is straightforward; it just sends the entire list of books in the response.\n\n**3. Updating a book by ID**\n\nTo update a book, I'll need a PUT endpoint at `/books/:id`, where `:id` is the book's ID.\n\n```javascript\napp.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = books.findIndex(book => book.id === bookId);\n  if (index === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  const { title, author, publicationYear } = req.body;\n  if (!title || !author || !publicationYear) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });\n  }\n  books[index] = {\n    id: bookId,\n    title,\n    author,\n    publicationYear\n  };\n  res.json(books[index]);\n});\n```\n\nHere, I first find the index of the book with the given ID. If it doesn't exist, I return a 404 Not Found error. Otherwise, I update the book's information with the new data provided in the request body and return the updated book.\n\n**4. Deleting a book by ID**\n\nFor deleting a book, I'll set up a DELETE endpoint at `/books/:id`.\n\n```javascript\napp.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = books.findIndex(book => book.id === bookId);\n  if (index === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  const deletedBook = books.splice(index, 1);\n  res.json(deletedBook[0]);\n});\n```\n\nSimilar to the update endpoint, I find the book by ID, remove it from the array using `splice`, and return the deleted book in the response.\n\nThat's pretty much it for the basic CRUD operations. Now, I'll make sure that the server starts correctly by running `node app.js` in the terminal.\n\nTo test the API, I can use tools like Postman or curl to send HTTP requests to the server.\n\nFor example, to add a new book:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/books -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"Sample Book\",\"author\":\"John Doe\",\"publicationYear\":2021}'\n```\n\nTo get all books:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:3000/books\n```\n\nTo update a book with ID 1:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"Updated Book\",\"author\":\"Jane Doe\",\"publicationYear\":2022}'\n```\n\nTo delete a book with ID 1:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/1\n```\n\nThese are basic operations, and in a real-world scenario, you'd want to add more features like validation, error handling, and perhaps using a proper database for persistence. But for this exercise, this should suffice.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple REST API for managing a collection of books using Node.js and Express, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Project:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir book-api\n   cd book-api\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Express:**\n   ```bash\n   npm install express\n   ```\n\n3. **Create `app.js`:**\n   Set up the server and define routes for CRUD operations.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n   const port = 3000;\n\n   app.use(express.json());\n\n   let books = [];\n   let idCounter = 1;\n\n   // POST /books - Add a new book\n   app.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n     const { title, author, publicationYear } = req.body;\n     if (!title || !author || !publicationYear) {\n       return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });\n     }\n     const newBook = {\n       id: idCounter++,\n       title,\n       author,\n       publicationYear\n     };\n     books.push(newBook);\n     res.status(201).json(newBook);\n   });\n\n   // GET /books - Retrieve all books\n   app.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n     res.json(books);\n   });\n\n   // PUT /books/:id - Update a book by ID\n   app.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n     const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n     const index = books.findIndex(book => book.id === bookId);\n     if (index === -1) {\n       return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n     }\n     const { title, author, publicationYear } = req.body;\n     if (!title || !author || !publicationYear) {\n       return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });\n     }\n     books[index] = {\n       id: bookId,\n       title,\n       author,\n       publicationYear\n     };\n     res.json(books[index]);\n   });\n\n   // DELETE /books/:id - Delete a book by ID\n   app.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n     const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n     const index = books.findIndex(book => book.id === bookId);\n     if (index === -1) {\n       return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n     }\n     const deletedBook = books.splice(index, 1);\n     res.json(deletedBook[0]);\n   });\n\n   app.listen(port, () => {\n     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Server:**\n   ```bash\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\n5. **Test the API:**\n   Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API.\n\n   - **Add a new book:**\n     ```bash\n     curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/books -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"Sample Book\",\"author\":\"John Doe\",\"publicationYear\":2021}'\n     ```\n\n   - **Retrieve all books:**\n     ```bash\n     curl http://localhost:3000/books\n     ```\n\n   - **Update a book by ID:**\n     ```bash\n     curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"Updated Book\",\"author\":\"Jane Doe\",\"publicationYear\":2022}'\n     ```\n\n   - **Delete a book by ID:**\n     ```bash\n     curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/1\n     ```\n\nThis setup provides a basic in-memory REST API for managing books with the specified operations. For production use, consider adding more robust error handling, validation, and persistent storage."
