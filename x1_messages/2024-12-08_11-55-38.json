        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 8 green balls. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the basic formula for probability: the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the number of red balls is 5, and the number of blue balls is 7. So, the total number of favorable outcomes should be 5 plus 7, which is 12.\n\nNow, what's the total number of possible outcomes? That should be the total number of balls in the bag. So, 5 red plus 7 blue plus 8 green equals 20 balls in total.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball should be 12 divided by 20. Let me simplify that fraction. 12/20 is the same as 3/5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the addition rule of probability. The probability of A or B is P(A) plus P(B) minus P(A and B). But in this case, since picking a red ball and picking a blue ball are mutually exclusive events (you can't pick both at the same time), P(A and B) is zero. So, it should just be P(red) plus P(blue).\n\nLet me calculate that. P(red) is 5/20, which is 1/4, and P(blue) is 7/20. So, 1/4 plus 7/20. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator, which would be 20. 1/4 is equivalent to 5/20, so 5/20 plus 7/20 is 12/20, which again simplifies to 3/5.\n\nHmm, that matches what I got earlier. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue. The number of green balls is 8, so the probability of picking a green ball is 8/20, which is 2/5. Therefore, the probability of not picking a green ball is 1 minus 2/5, which is 3/5. That matches again.\n\nAlright, so no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting 3/5 as the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me double-check the total number of balls. 5 red plus 7 blue plus 8 green does indeed equal 20. And the number of red and blue balls combined is 12. So, 12 out of 20 is indeed 3/5.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Probability is 3/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
