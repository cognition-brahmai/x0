The input should be a research topic or query, and the output will be a list of relevant academic sources.\nPDFExtractor[input]: A tool that extracts text from a PDF file. The input should be a link to a PDF file, and the output will be the full text of the PDF.\nNLP[input]: A natural language processing tool that can understand and answer questions based on a given context. The input should be a question and some context, and the output will be an answer to the question.\n\nFormat:\nPlan: [First Action]\n#E1 = [Tool with Input Parameter]\nPlan: [Next Action]\n#E2 = [Next Tool with Input Parameter]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the latest research on the effects of climate change on polar bear populations?"
