        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 6 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. I need to find the probability of drawing two red balls in a row without replacing the first one. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. There are 6 red, 4 blue, and 5 green, so total balls are 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing two red balls in a row without replacement means that once I draw the first red ball, I don't put it back, and then I draw a second red ball.\n\nSo, the probability of the first event (drawing the first red ball) and the second event (drawing the second red ball without replacement) both happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(both red) = P(first red) * P(second red | first red)\n\nSo, P(first red) is the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw. Since there are 6 red balls out of 15 total balls, that's 6/15.\n\nNow, P(second red | first red) is the probability of drawing a second red ball given that the first ball drawn was red. Since we're not replacing the first ball, there are now 5 red balls left and the total number of balls is now 14 (since one ball has been removed).\n\nSo, P(second red | first red) = 5/14.\n\nTherefore, P(both red) = (6/15) * (5/14)\n\nNow, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 6/15 can be simplified to 2/5.\n\nSo, P(both red) = (2/5) * (5/14) = (2 * 5) / (5 * 14) = 10 / 70 = 1/7.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 6 is C(6,2) = (6*5)/2 = 15.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 2 balls out of 15 is C(15,2) = (15*14)/2 = 105.\n\nSo, P(both red) = C(6,2) / C(15,2) = 15/105 = 1/7.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability without using combinations.\n\nProbability of first red ball: 6/15.\n\nGiven that the first ball was red, probability of second red ball: 5/14.\n\nMultiplying them gives (6/15)*(5/14) = (6*5)/(15*14) = 30/210 = 1/7.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nWait, but I've heard of some common mistakes in probability. Is there any mistake I might be making here?\n\nLet me think. Without replacement means that the probabilities change after the first draw, which I've accounted for by reducing the number of red balls and the total number of balls for the second draw.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the probability of drawing two red balls in a specific order.\n\nThe first draw is red with probability 6/15, and the second is red with probability 5/14, given the first was red.\n\nMultiplying them gives 1/7, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the probability of drawing two red balls in any order, but since I'm specifying \"in a row\" without replacement, the order matters, but in this case, since both draws are red, the order doesn't affect the outcome.\n\nWait, no. If I'm drawing without replacement, and I want both to be red, the order doesn't matter in terms of the final outcome, only in terms of the sequence of events.\n\nBut in this problem, it's specifically \"two red balls in a row,\" which implies sequence, but in probability, for this type of problem, it's the same as both being red, regardless of order, because we're not distinguishing between the balls.\n\nWait, but in reality, it's a sequence: first ball red and second ball red.\n\nWhich is the same as both balls being red when order matters.\n\nBut in combinations, order doesn't matter.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nThe answer is 1/7, and I've arrived at it through two different methods, both giving the same answer.\n\nSo, I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of permutations.\n\nThe number of ways to draw two red balls in order is P(6,2) = 6*5 = 30.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw any two balls in order is P(15,2) = 15*14 = 210.\n\nSo, P(both red) = 30/210 = 1/7.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nOkay, I'm confident now that 1/7 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{7}} \\]"
