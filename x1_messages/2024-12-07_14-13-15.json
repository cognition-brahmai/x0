        "content": "In George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead,\" the term used to refer to the undead creatures is \"ghouls.\" However, it's worth noting that the film popularized the concept of \"zombies\" in modern culture, even though the word \"zombie\" isn't used in the movie itself. The term \"ghoul\" is used in the script, but the creatures are often referred to as \"those things\" or \"them\" by the characters. The film's impact led to the misnomer of calling them zombies, which has since become the standard term for this type of undead being in popular culture."
