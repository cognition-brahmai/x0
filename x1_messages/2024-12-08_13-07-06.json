The landmarks are: Eiffel Tower, Great Wall of China, Statue of Liberty, Pyramids of Giza, Sydney Opera House, Machu Picchu, Taj Mahal, and Colosseum. I need to figure out where each one is located and group them accordingly.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the Eiffel Tower. I know that's in Paris, which is in France, right? So, France is in Europe. Next is the Great Wall of China. That's obviously in China, which is in Asia. The Statue of Liberty is in the United States, specifically in New York Harbor. So, that's North America. The Pyramids of Giza are in Egypt, which is in North Africa. The Sydney Opera House is in Sydney, Australia. Machu Picchu is in Peru, South America. The Taj Mahal is in India, Asia. And finally, the Colosseum is in Rome, Italy, which is in Europe.\n\nSo, let's see. I can group them by continent:\n\n1. Europe:\n\n- Eiffel Tower (France)\n\n- Colosseum (Italy)\n\n2. Asia:\n\n- Great Wall of China (China)\n\n- Taj Mahal (India)\n\n3. North America:\n\n- Statue of Liberty (United States)\n\n4. Africa:\n\n- Pyramids of Giza (Egypt)\n\n5. Oceania:\n\n- Sydney Opera House (Australia)\n\n6. South America:\n\n- Machu Picchu (Peru)\n\nWait, but I remember that sometimes people consider Australia as its own continent, but in terms of geographical continents, it's part of Oceania. So, I'll list it under Oceania.\n\nAlternatively, I could group them by country, but I think grouping by continent makes more sense for this classification task.\n\nLet me double-check if I have the locations correct:\n\n- Eiffel Tower: Paris, France, Europe.\n\n- Great Wall of China: China, Asia.\n\n- Statue of Liberty: New York, United States, North America.\n\n- Pyramids of Giza: Giza, Egypt, Africa.\n\n- Sydney Opera House: Sydney, Australia, Oceania.\n\n- Machu Picchu: Peru, South America.\n\n- Taj Mahal: Agra, India, Asia.\n\n- Colosseum: Rome, Italy, Europe.\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Europe: Eiffel Tower, Colosseum.\n\n- Asia: Great Wall of China, Taj Mahal.\n\n- North America: Statue of Liberty.\n\n- Africa: Pyramids of Giza.\n\n- Oceania: Sydney Opera House.\n\n- South America: Machu Picchu.\n\nI don't think there's any other way to classify them based on geographical locations unless I get more specific, like states or provinces, but that might be too detailed for this task.\n\nAlternatively, I could categorize them by countries:\n\n- France: Eiffel Tower.\n\n- China: Great Wall of China.\n\n- United States: Statue of Liberty.\n\n- Egypt: Pyramids of Giza.\n\n- Australia: Sydney Opera House.\n\n- Peru: Machu Picchu.\n\n- India: Taj Mahal.\n\n- Italy: Colosseum.\n\nBut again, I think the continental classification is what's being asked here.\n\nAnother way could be by region, like grouping Europe and Asia together as Eurasia, but that might not be precise enough.\n\nOr perhaps by hemispheres, like Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. But that might not be as informative.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- Northern Hemisphere: Eiffel Tower (France), Great Wall of China, Statue of Liberty (New York), Pyramids of Giza (Egypt), Colosseum (Italy), Taj Mahal (India).\n\n- Southern Hemisphere: Sydney Opera House (Australia), Machu Picchu (Peru).\n\nBecause Australia and Peru are both south of the equator.\n\nBut I think the continent-based classification is the most straightforward and appropriate for this task.\n\nSo, I'll stick with that.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll list them again:\n\n1. Europe:\n\n- Eiffel Tower (France)\n\n- Colosseum (Italy)\n\n2. Asia:\n\n- Great Wall of China (China)\n\n- Taj Mahal (India)\n\n3. North America:\n\n- Statue of Liberty (United States)\n\n4. Africa:\n\n- Pyramids of Giza (Egypt)\n\n5. Oceania:\n\n- Sydney Opera House (Australia)\n\n6. South America:\n\n- Machu Picchu (Peru)\n\nLooks good.\n\nI don't think there's any confusion about these locations, as they are well-known and their geographical positions are straightforward.\n\nTherefore, this classification should suffice for the task at hand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Landmarks classified by their geographical locations as detailed above.}}\\]"
