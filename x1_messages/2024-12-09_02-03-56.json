        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There's a class with 15 boys and 20 girls, and I need to figure out how many ways to form a committee of 5 students that includes at least 2 girls. Hmm, combinatorics stuff. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that \"at least 2 girls\" means the committee can have 2, 3, 4, or even 5 girls. So, I need to consider all these possibilities. One way to approach this is to calculate the total number of possible committees and then subtract the number of committees that don't meet the requirement, i.e., those with fewer than 2 girls.\n\nWait, that might be efficient. The total number of ways to choose any 5 students from the class is the combination of 35 students taken 5 at a time, since there are 15 boys + 20 girls = 35 students in total. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number, and k is the number to choose.\n\nSo, total ways = C(35, 5).\n\nNow, committees with fewer than 2 girls mean committees with 0 girls or 1 girl.\n\nFirst, committees with 0 girls: that means all 5 members are boys. There are 15 boys, so the number of such committees is C(15, 5).\n\nSecond, committees with 1 girl: choose 1 girl from 20 and 4 boys from 15. So, that's C(20, 1) * C(15, 4).\n\nTherefore, the number of committees with at least 2 girls is total ways minus the sum of committees with 0 girls and 1 girl.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\nNumber of desired committees = C(35, 5) - [C(15, 5) + C(20, 1) * C(15, 4)]\n\nLet me calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, C(35, 5):\n\nC(35, 5) = 35! / (5! * 30!) = (35 * 34 * 33 * 32 * 31) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = (35 * 34 * 33 * 32 * 31) / 120.\n\nLet's compute numerator and denominator separately to avoid big numbers.\n\nNumerator: 35 * 34 = 1190, 1190 * 33 = 39270, 39270 * 32 = 1256640, 1256640 * 31 = 38955840.\n\nDenominator: 5! = 120.\n\nSo, C(35, 5) = 38955840 / 120 = 324632.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my multiplication.\n\nActually, let's use a calculator for this to ensure accuracy.\n\nC(35, 5) = 324,632.\n\nOkay, that seems better.\n\nNext, C(15, 5):\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5! * 10!) = (15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = (15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11) / 120.\n\nCalculate numerator: 15 * 14 = 210, 210 * 13 = 2730, 2730 * 12 = 32760, 32760 * 11 = 360360.\n\nDenominator: 120.\n\nSo, C(15, 5) = 360360 / 120 = 3003.\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, C(20, 1):\n\nC(20, 1) = 20.\n\nAnd C(15, 4):\n\nC(15, 4) = 15! / (4! * 11!) = (15 * 14 * 13 * 12) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = (15 * 14 * 13 * 12) / 24.\n\nNumerator: 15 * 14 = 210, 210 * 13 = 2730, 2730 * 12 = 32760.\n\nDenominator: 24.\n\nSo, C(15, 4) = 32760 / 24 = 1365.\n\nTherefore, C(20, 1) * C(15, 4) = 20 * 1365 = 27,300.\n\nNow, sum of committees with 0 and 1 girl: 3003 + 27,300 = 30,303.\n\nFinally, number of desired committees: 324,632 - 30,303 = 294,329.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Is there another way to approach this to verify?\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of committees with at least 2 girls directly by summing up the committees with exactly 2 girls, exactly 3 girls, exactly 4 girls, and exactly 5 girls.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nC(20, 2) * C(15, 3) + C(20, 3) * C(15, 2) + C(20, 4) * C(15, 1) + C(20, 5) * C(15, 0).\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nFirst, C(20, 2) * C(15, 3):\n\nC(20, 2) = (20 * 19) / 2 = 190.\n\nC(15, 3) = (15 * 14 * 13) / 6 = (2730) / 6 = 455.\n\nSo, 190 * 455 = 86,450.\n\nSecond, C(20, 3) * C(15, 2):\n\nC(20, 3) = (20 * 19 * 18) / 6 = (6840) / 6 = 1140.\n\nC(15, 2) = (15 * 14) / 2 = 105.\n\nSo, 1140 * 105 = 119,700.\n\nThird, C(20, 4) * C(15, 1):\n\nC(20, 4) = (20 * 19 * 18 * 17) / 24 = (116280) / 24 = 4845.\n\nC(15, 1) = 15.\n\nSo, 4845 * 15 = 72,675.\n\nFourth, C(20, 5) * C(15, 0):\n\nC(20, 5) = (20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16) / 120 = (1860480) / 120 = 15504.\n\nC(15, 0) = 1.\n\nSo, 15504 * 1 = 15,504.\n\nNow, sum all these up: 86,450 + 119,700 + 72,675 + 15,504 = let's add them step by step.\n\n86,450 + 119,700 = 206,150.\n\n206,150 + 72,675 = 278,825.\n\n278,825 + 15,504 = 294,329.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier: 294,329.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to form a committee of 5 students with at least 2 girls is 294,329.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{294329} \\]"
