        "content": "Let's see. The company's revenue is increasing by 8% every month, and in January it was $50,000. I need to find out what the revenue will be in December of the same year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many months are between January and December. Well, December is the 12th month, and January is the 1st, so there are 11 months between them.\n\nBut wait, if the revenue in January is $50,000, and it increases every month, then from January to December is 11 increments.\n\nBut actually, in January, it's $50,000, and then it increases 8% in February, then another 8% in March, and so on, up to December.\n\nSo, the number of increases is 11.\n\nThis sounds like compound interest, where the revenue is compounded monthly at a rate of 8%.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount after \\( n \\) periods\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (initial revenue)\n\n- \\( r \\) is the monthly growth rate\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of periods (months)\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\( P = 50,000 \\)\n\n- \\( r = 8\\% = 0.08 \\)\n\n- \\( n = 11 \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times (1 + 0.08)^{11} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 1 + 0.08 = 1.08 \\)\n\nThen, raise 1.08 to the power of 11:\n\n\\[ 1.08^{11} \\]\n\nI can use a calculator for this.\n\n\\[ 1.08^{11} \\approx 2.3316 \\]\n\nNow, multiply this by the initial revenue:\n\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times 2.3316 \\approx 116,580 \\]\n\nSo, the revenue in December would be approximately $116,580.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the revenue each month is 1.08 times the previous month's revenue.\n\nSo, starting with January at $50,000:\n\nFebruary: \\( 50,000 \\times 1.08 \\)\n\nMarch: \\( 50,000 \\times 1.08^2 \\)\n\n...\n\nDecember: \\( 50,000 \\times 1.08^{11} \\)\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider January as month 1, and December as month 12, then the number of increases is 11, because the first month starts at $50,000 and increases each subsequent month.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the revenue in December would be approximately $116,580.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{116580} \\]"
