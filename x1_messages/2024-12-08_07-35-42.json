Each plan will correspond to an evidence value which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that enables the user to search for information using DuckDuckGo search engine. It finds a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebCrawler[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline separated links, where input is one or more links, and generates plain text output containing the content of the links.\nURLPicker[input]: Picks out links from plain text and generates a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nSAM[input]: Question answering language model, particularly helpful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function should be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., SAM[What is the height of Mount Everest, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some notable achievements of Albert Einstein and when did he receive the Nobel Prize in Physics?"
