        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a team of three workers who can paint a house in 6 hours. They start at 8 am, and another worker joins them after lunch at 1 pm. We need to figure out when they'll finish painting the house with the additional help.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how much of the house is painted before the fourth worker joins. The team starts at 8 am and continues until 1 pm. That's from 8 to 12 is 4 hours, and then from 12 to 1 is another hour, so total of 5 hours before the fourth worker joins.\n\nGiven that the original team of three can paint the whole house in 6 hours, their combined painting rate is 1 house per 6 hours. So, in one hour, they paint 1/6 of the house.\n\nTherefore, in 5 hours, they would paint 5*(1/6) = 5/6 of the house.\n\nThat means, when the fourth worker joins at 1 pm, there's still 1 - 5/6 = 1/6 of the house left to paint.\n\nNow, with the fourth worker joining, the team size increases to four workers. But we don't know how the addition of one more worker affects the painting rate. Do the four workers paint faster, and if so, by how much?\n\nWell, if three workers can paint the house in 6 hours, perhaps we can figure out the painting rate per worker and then calculate the new rate for four workers.\n\nLet's assume each worker paints at the same rate. So, the combined rate of three workers is 1 house per 6 hours, which means each worker paints 1/3 of a house in 6 hours, or (1/3)/6 = 1/18 houses per hour.\n\nTherefore, each worker paints at a rate of 1/18 houses per hour.\n\nWith four workers, the combined rate would be 4*(1/18) = 4/18 = 2/9 houses per hour.\n\nNow, there's 1/6 of the house left to paint. Time required would be the remaining work divided by the new painting rate.\n\nTime = (1/6) / (2/9) = (1/6)*(9/2) = 9/12 = 3/4 hours.\n\nSo, 3/4 hours is 45 minutes.\n\nTherefore, if the fourth worker joins at 1 pm, and it takes an additional 45 minutes to finish the remaining 1/6 of the house, they should finish at 1:45 pm.\n\nWait a minute, but is this the only possible answer? Maybe there are other factors to consider.\n\nFor example, perhaps the workers have a fixed amount of paint or energy, and adding another worker doesn't necessarily speed things up proportionally. Maybe there's a limit to how many workers can effectively work on painting the house without getting in each other's way.\n\nHowever, based on the information given, it seems like we're to assume that adding more workers linearly increases the painting rate. So, perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original team of three workers paints the house in 6 hours, and their combined rate is 1/6 of the house per hour, as previously calculated. But perhaps the fourth worker has a different painting speed.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify that all workers paint at the same rate, although it's a reasonable assumption unless stated otherwise.\n\nAssuming all workers paint at the same rate, the initial calculation seems valid.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total man-hours required to paint the house.\n\nIf three workers can paint the house in 6 hours, the total man-hours required are 3 workers * 6 hours = 18 man-hours.\n\nFrom 8 am to 1 pm is 5 hours, so the three workers would have completed 3 workers * 5 hours = 15 man-hours of work.\n\nTherefore, the remaining work is 18 - 15 = 3 man-hours.\n\nWith four workers after 1 pm, the time required to complete the remaining 3 man-hours is 3 man-hours / 4 workers = 0.75 hours, which is 45 minutes.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier conclusion that they finish at 1:45 pm.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any break time or lunch time that might affect the total time.\n\nThe problem mentions that they start at 8 am and that another worker joins after lunch at 1 pm. It doesn't specify if there's a lunch break or if they work through lunch.\n\nIf there's a lunch break, say from 12 pm to 1 pm, then the time from 8 am to 12 pm is 4 hours, and from 1 pm onward with four workers.\n\nBut the problem says \"starts painting at 8 am\" and \"another worker joins the team after lunch at 1 pm.\" It doesn't explicitly mention a break, so perhaps they are painting continuously from 8 am to 1 pm, and then the fourth worker joins at 1 pm.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: No lunch break. They paint from 8 am to 1 pm (5 hours) with three workers, then from 1 pm onward with four workers.\n\nAs calculated earlier, they finish at 1:45 pm.\n\nSecond scenario: They have a lunch break from 12 pm to 1 pm, so they paint from 8 am to 12 pm (4 hours) with three workers, then from 1 pm onward with four workers.\n\nIn this case, the time with three workers is 4 hours, not 5.\n\nSo, work done in 4 hours: 4*(1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3 of the house.\n\nRemaining work: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the house.\n\nWith four workers, painting at 2/9 houses per hour, time required is (1/3)/(2/9) = (1/3)*(9/2) = 9/6 = 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, they would finish at 1 pm + 1.5 hours = 2:30 pm.\n\nBut the problem says \"starts painting at 8 am\" and \"another worker joins the team after lunch at 1 pm.\" It doesn't specify a break between 12 and 1 pm, so perhaps they painted continuously from 8 am to 1 pm.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is more likely correct, with a finishing time of 1:45 pm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"after lunch at 1 pm\" means that they take a lunch break from 12 pm to 1 pm, and then the fourth worker joins at 1 pm.\n\nIn that case, it's the second scenario, leading to a finishing time of 2:30 pm.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the lunch break, both scenarios are possible.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"the team starts painting at 8 am\" and \"another worker joins the team after lunch at 1 pm.\" It doesn't specify a break time, so perhaps they painted continuously from 8 am to 1 pm, and then the fourth worker joins at 1 pm.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is more accurate, leading to a finishing time of 1:45 pm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"after lunch at 1 pm\" implies that the team stops painting for lunch at 1 pm, and the fourth worker joins them then.\n\nBut that seems less likely, as it would imply that the fourth worker joins them during their lunch break, which may not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the team paints from 8 am to 1 pm without a break, and then the fourth worker joins them after 1 pm.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, assuming no lunch break:\n\n- Painting from 8 am to 1 pm: 5 hours with 3 workers.\n\n- Work done: 5*(1/6) = 5/6 of the house.\n\n- Remaining work: 1/6.\n\n- With 4 workers: rate = 2/9 houses per hour.\n\n- Time required: (1/6)/(2/9) = 45 minutes.\n\n- Finish at 1:45 pm.\n\nSecond, assuming a lunch break from 12 pm to 1 pm:\n\n- Painting from 8 am to 12 pm: 4 hours with 3 workers.\n\n- Work done: 4*(1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3 of the house.\n\n- Remaining work: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\n- With 4 workers: rate = 2/9 houses per hour.\n\n- Time required: (1/3)/(2/9) = 1.5 hours.\n\n- Finish at 1 pm + 1.5 hours = 2:30 pm.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer depends on whether there's a lunch break or not.\n\nBut since the problem mentions \"after lunch at 1 pm,\" it suggests that there is a lunch break from, say, 12 pm to 1 pm, and the fourth worker joins them after that.\n\nTherefore, they paint from 8 am to 12 pm (4 hours) with 3 workers, then from 1 pm onward with 4 workers.\n\nThus, the second scenario is more appropriate, leading to a finishing time of 2:30 pm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"after lunch at 1 pm\" means that they finish lunch at 1 pm and continue painting with the additional worker.\n\nIn that case, it's similar to the second scenario.\n\nTherefore, considering the likely interpretation, they start painting at 8 am, take a lunch break until 1 pm, and then continue painting with four workers.\n\nHence, they paint for 4 hours with three workers, completing 2/3 of the house, leaving 1/3 to be painted by four workers at a rate of 2/9 houses per hour, taking 1.5 hours, finishing at 2:30 pm.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is 2:30 pm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2:30\\ \\text{pm}} \\]"
