        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is (6^2 - 4) / 2 + 3 * (8 - 5). Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. That's PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right).\n\nStarting with the parentheses:\n\n1. (6^2 - 4): I need to calculate what's inside this parenthesis first. But inside here, there's an exponent and a subtraction. Exponents come before subtraction, so 6^2 is 36. Then, 36 - 4 is 32. So, (6^2 - 4) simplifies to 32.\n\n2. (8 - 5): This is straightforward. 8 minus 5 is 3.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to: 32 / 2 + 3 * 3.\n\nNext, exponents are already handled, so moving on to multiplication and division from left to right.\n\n3. 32 / 2: 32 divided by 2 is 16.\n\n4. 3 * 3: 3 multiplied by 3 is 9.\n\nNow, the expression is: 16 + 9.\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n5. 16 + 9 equals 25.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 25.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet's go through it again:\n\nOriginal expression: (6^2 - 4) / 2 + 3 * (8 - 5)\n\nFirst, parentheses:\n\n- 6^2 is 36\n\n- 36 - 4 is 32\n\n- 8 - 5 is 3\n\nSo, it becomes: 32 / 2 + 3 * 3\n\nNext, division and multiplication from left to right:\n\n- 32 / 2 = 16\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, add them together: 16 + 9 = 25\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think the answer is 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
