        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The diameter is 12 feet, and the height is 15 feet. I need to find out the volume of the tank in cubic feet. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nSo, I have the diameter, which is 12 feet. To find the radius, I need to divide the diameter by 2 because the radius is half of the diameter. So:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{12 \\, \\text{feet}}{2} = 6 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\nNext, the height \\( h \\) is given as 15 feet.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (6 \\, \\text{feet})^2 (15 \\, \\text{feet}) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the square of the radius:\n\n\\[ (6 \\, \\text{feet})^2 = 36 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\nThen, multiply that by the height:\n\n\\[ 36 \\, \\text{square feet} \\times 15 \\, \\text{feet} = 540 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by \\( \\pi \\). Since \\( \\pi \\) is approximately 3.1416:\n\n\\[ V \\approx 540 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\times 3.1416 \\approx 1696.46 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that sometimes, especially in practical applications, people might use 3.14 as an approximation for \\( \\pi \\), which would make the calculation a bit simpler.\n\nUsing \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14 \\):\n\n\\[ V \\approx 540 \\times 3.14 = 1695.6 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nThat's pretty close to the earlier calculation. For more precision, I could use a more accurate value of \\( \\pi \\), but for most practical purposes, 3.14 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express the volume in terms of \\( \\pi \\), I can leave it as:\n\n\\[ V = 540\\pi \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nThat's also a valid way to present the answer, especially if the problem doesn't specify to use a particular approximation for \\( \\pi \\).\n\nLet me check if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using the formula for the volume of a cylinder in terms of the diameter?\n\nI know that the radius is half the diameter, so I could substitute \\( r = \\frac{d}{2} \\) into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 h = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d^2}{4}\\right) h = \\frac{\\pi d^2 h}{4} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\pi (12 \\, \\text{feet})^2 (15 \\, \\text{feet})}{4} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 144 \\, \\text{square feet} \\times 15 \\, \\text{feet}}{4} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 2160 \\, \\text{cubic feet}}{4} = 540\\pi \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nSo, that matches the earlier result. That's a good check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the area of the base first and then multiply by the height. The base is a circle with diameter 12 feet, so radius 6 feet. The area \\( a \\) of the base is:\n\n\\[ a = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (6 \\, \\text{feet})^2 = 36\\pi \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\nThen, the volume is:\n\n\\[ V = a \\times h = 36\\pi \\, \\text{square feet} \\times 15 \\, \\text{feet} = 540\\pi \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. This reinforces that my calculation is correct.\n\nNow, if I need to provide a numerical value, I can use the approximation \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\):\n\n\\[ V \\approx 540 \\times 3.14159 \\approx 1696.46 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's 1696.46 cubic feet.\n\nBut, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of \\( \\pi \\). In that case, 540\u03c0 cubic feet is fine.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a real-world application, maybe they want the volume to the nearest cubic foot. In that case, 1696 cubic feet would be appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes volumes are expressed in gallons. If that's the case, I would need to convert cubic feet to gallons. But since the problem asks for cubic feet, I don't need to do that.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, I know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48052 gallons. So, if needed, the volume in gallons would be:\n\n\\[ 1696.46 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\times 7.48052 \\, \\text{gallons per cubic foot} \\approx 12694.7 \\, \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nBut again, since the problem specifies cubic feet, I should stick with that.\n\nLet me see if there's any other aspect to consider. Is the tank filled to the top? Does the problem provide any information about the liquid level? No, it just asks for the volume of the tank, assuming it's full.\n\nAlso, is there any thickness to the tank walls that I need to account for? The problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I can assume the dimensions given are for the interior of the tank.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The volume of the cylindrical water tank is either 540\u03c0 cubic feet or approximately 1696.46 cubic feet.\n\nI think the most precise way to present the answer is to use the exact value in terms of \u03c0, which is 540\u03c0 cubic feet. If a numerical approximation is needed, then 1696.46 cubic feet is acceptable.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{540\\pi \\text{ cubic feet} \\approx 1696.46 \\text{ cubic feet}} \\]"
