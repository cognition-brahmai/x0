        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a group of 6 friends who went out to dinner, and they need to split the bill evenly. The total cost of the meal is $150, and there's a 15% service charge added to that. I need to find out how much each person has to pay.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what the total bill is, including the service charge. The service charge is 15% of the meal cost, so I need to calculate 15% of $150 and then add that to the original $150.\n\nLet me calculate 15% of $150. To find 15% of something, I can multiply it by 0.15. So, $150 multiplied by 0.15 is $22.50. That's the service charge.\n\nNow, I add the service charge to the original bill: $150 + $22.50 = $172.50. So, the total bill amount is $172.50.\n\nNext, this total needs to be split evenly among 6 people. To find out how much each person pays, I divide the total bill by 6.\n\nSo, $172.50 divided by 6. Let me do that calculation.\n\n172.50 divided by 6 is... hmm, 6 times 28 is 168, which is less than 172.50. So, 28 dollars each, but there's a remainder.\n\n172.50 minus 168 is 4.50. So, that 4.50 needs to be divided among the 6 people. 4.50 divided by 6 is 0.75.\n\nSo, each person pays $28 plus $0.75, which is $28.75.\n\nWait, but let me check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal bill is $172.50.\n\nDivided by 6.\n\nLet me try calculating it differently. Maybe using a different method.\n\nI can also think of it as 172.50 divided by 6.\n\nLet me try long division.\n\n6 goes into 17 two times (12), subtract 12 from 17, that's 5.\n\nBring down the 2, so it's 52.\n\n6 goes into 52 eight times (48), subtract 48 from 52, that's 4.\n\nBring down the 5, so it's 45.\n\n6 goes into 45 seven times (42), subtract 42 from 45, that's 3.\n\nSo, it's 28.75.\n\nWait, but that's the same answer I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in decimals.\n\n172.50 divided by 6.\n\n172 divided by 6 is 28.666..., and 0.50 divided by 6 is 0.0833...\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and it's probably best to stick with the earlier method.\n\nSo, each person pays $28.75.\n\nBut let me double-check the initial calculations to make sure.\n\nOriginal bill: $150.\n\nService charge: 15% of $150 is $22.50.\n\nTotal bill: $150 + $22.50 = $172.50.\n\nDivided by 6: $172.50 / 6 = $28.75.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the service charge per person.\n\nService charge is $22.50 total.\n\nDivided by 6, that's $3.75 per person.\n\nSo, each person's share of the service charge is $3.75.\n\nThen, the original bill per person would be $150 / 6 = $25.\n\nSo, $25 plus $3.75 is $28.75.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but in this case, $25 plus $3.75 is indeed $28.75.\n\nSo, yes, each person pays $28.75.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28.75} \\]"
