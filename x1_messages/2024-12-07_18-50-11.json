        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about two trains moving towards each other from different stations. Station A and Station B are 300 miles apart. One train leaves Station A going towards Station B at 60 mph, and another train leaves Station B going towards Station A at 90 mph. I need to find out how far apart they are one hour before they meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out when and where they meet. Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet as t hours. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph. The total distance between them is 300 miles, so the time to meet is distance divided by relative speed: t = 300 miles / 150 mph = 2 hours.\n\nSo, they meet after 2 hours. Now, I need to find out how far apart they are one hour before they meet, which is at t = 1 hour.\n\nAt t = 1 hour:\n\n- The train from Station A has traveled 60 mph * 1 hour = 60 miles.\n\n- The train from Station B has traveled 90 mph * 1 hour = 90 miles.\n\nSo, the total distance they have covered together in 1 hour is 60 + 90 = 150 miles.\n\nSince the total distance between the stations is 300 miles, the distance apart after 1 hour is 300 - 150 = 150 miles.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. If they meet after 2 hours, then one hour before they meet would be when they have each traveled for 1 hour, and the distance apart should be the distance they cover in the remaining 1 hour.\n\nLet me think differently. In the last hour before they meet, both trains are still moving towards each other. So, in that last hour, the first train covers 60 miles, and the second train covers 90 miles. Therefore, together, they cover 60 + 90 = 150 miles in that last hour.\n\nThat means, one hour before they meet, they are 150 miles apart.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that after 1 hour, they are 150 miles apart. But according to this, one hour before they meet, they are also 150 miles apart. Hmm.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\nTotal time to meet is 2 hours. So, one hour before they meet is at t = 1 hour. At t = 1 hour, the distance they have closed is 150 miles (60 + 90), so distance apart is 300 - 150 = 150 miles.\n\nAlternatively, in the last hour, they cover 150 miles towards each other, so one hour before they meet, they must be 150 miles apart.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be 150 miles.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet\u2019s consider their positions at the time they meet, which is at t = 2 hours.\n\n- Train from A has traveled 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\n- Train from B has traveled 90 mph * 2 hours = 180 miles.\n\n- Total distance covered: 120 + 180 = 300 miles, which matches the distance between the stations.\n\nNow, one hour before they meet, which is at t = 1 hour:\n\n- Train from A has traveled 60 miles.\n\n- Train from B has traveled 90 miles.\n\n- So, the remaining distance between them is 300 - (60 + 90) = 150 miles.\n\nAlternatively, in the last hour, they cover 150 miles towards each other, which is the distance they were apart at t = 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, the distance apart one hour before they meet is indeed 150 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
