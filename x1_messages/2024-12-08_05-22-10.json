        "content": "So the factory currently produces 1500 items per day and operates for 300 days a year. That means in the first year, it produces 1500 items/day * 300 days = 450,000 items.\n\nNow, its production rate increases by 10% each year. So, each year, the daily production increases by 10%.\n\nLet's calculate the production for each of the 5 years.\n\n**Year 1:**\n\nDaily production: 1500 items\n\nAnnual production: 1500 * 300 = 450,000 items\n\n**Year 2:**\n\nDaily production increases by 10%:\n\n1500 * 1.10 = 1650 items per day\n\nAnnual production: 1650 * 300 = 495,000 items\n\n**Year 3:**\n\nDaily production increases by another 10%:\n\n1650 * 1.10 = 1815 items per day\n\nAnnual production: 1815 * 300 = 544,500 items\n\n**Year 4:**\n\nDaily production increases by another 10%:\n\n1815 * 1.10 = 1996.5 items per day\n\nAnnual production: 1996.5 * 300 = 598,950 items\n\n**Year 5:**\n\nDaily production increases by another 10%:\n\n1996.5 * 1.10 = 2196.15 items per day\n\nAnnual production: 2196.15 * 300 = 658,845 items\n\nNow, to find the total production over 5 years, we add up the annual productions:\n\n450,000 + 495,000 + 544,500 + 598,950 + 658,845\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n450,000 + 495,000 = 945,000\n\n945,000 + 544,500 = 1,489,500\n\n1,489,500 + 598,950 = 2,088,450\n\n2,088,450 + 658,845 = 2,747,295\n\nSo, the total production over 5 years is 2,747,295 items.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series since the production increases by a fixed percentage each year.\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is:\n\nS = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S is the sum\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this case:\n\n- a is the first year's production: 450,000 items\n\n- r is 1 + the rate of increase: 1 + 0.10 = 1.10\n\n- n is 5 years\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 450,000 * (1.10^5 - 1)/(1.10 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 1.10^5:\n\n1.10^5 = 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 = 1.61051\n\nNow, S = 450,000 * (1.61051 - 1)/(0.10)\n\n= 450,000 * (0.61051)/0.10\n\n= 450,000 * 6.1051\n\n= 2,747,295 items\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory will produce a total of 2,747,295 items in 5 years, given a 10% increase in production rate each year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2747295} \\]"
