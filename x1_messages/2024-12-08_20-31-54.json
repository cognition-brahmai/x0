        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 people in the group. 30% of them prefer tea, and the rest prefer coffee. I need to find out how many more people prefer coffee than tea.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate how many people prefer tea. 30% of 50 is:\n\n30/100 * 50 = 0.3 * 50 = 15 people\n\nSo, 15 people prefer tea.\n\nNow, the rest prefer coffee. Since there are 50 people in total, the number of people who prefer coffee is:\n\n50 - 15 = 35 people\n\nNow, to find out how many more people prefer coffee than tea, I'll subtract the number of tea lovers from the number of coffee lovers:\n\n35 - 15 = 20 people\n\nSo, 20 more people prefer coffee than tea.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions or something else. Let me think.\n\nTotal people = 50\n\nPercentage preferring tea = 30%\n\nPercentage preferring coffee = 100% - 30% = 70%\n\nSo, number preferring coffee = 70% of 50\n\n70/100 * 50 = 0.7 * 50 = 35 people\n\nSame as before.\n\nDifference = coffee lovers - tea lovers = 35 - 15 = 20 people\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages.\n\nPercentage difference = 70% - 30% = 40%\n\nBut 40% of 50 is:\n\n40/100 * 50 = 0.4 * 50 = 20 people\n\nSame answer again. So, 20 people prefer coffee more than tea.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Sometimes I overthink these things, but in this case, it's pretty simple.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
