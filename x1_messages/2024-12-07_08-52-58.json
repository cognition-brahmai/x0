Hmm, this seems a bit confusing because you mentioned oranges, bananas, and apples, which are different types of fruits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It looks like there might be a mistake in the question because eating bananas shouldn't affect the number of apples you have, especially since apples weren't mentioned initially. Maybe you meant that you have 17 apples and eat 9 of them, and now you want to know how many are left?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a word problem where different fruits represent different variables, but that seems unlikely in this context. Let's assume that you have a certain number of apples, and the actions with oranges and bananas don't directly affect the apple count.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of apples remains unchanged by your actions with oranges and bananas. So, if you started with a certain number of apples and didn't do anything with them, you still have the same number left.\n\nHowever, since you didn't specify how many apples you had to begin with, it's impossible to give a numerical answer. Maybe you can provide more information or clarify the question?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps this is a trick question to test understanding of irrelevant information. The key point might be to recognize that the actions with oranges and bananas don't affect the apple count, so the number of apples remains the same as whatever you started with.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be that you have as many apples left as you had before you ate the bananas or considered the oranges.\n\nBut to give a specific number, I need to know the initial number of apples. Since that wasn't provided, I can't give a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the numbers of different fruits, but without additional information, it's impossible to determine.\n\nPerhaps you can provide more context or check if the question is stated correctly?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Insufficient information to determine the number of apples left.}} \\]"
