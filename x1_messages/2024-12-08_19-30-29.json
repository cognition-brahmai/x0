        "content": "So, the train is going at 60 miles per hour, and it takes 30 minutes to get from one station to the other. I need to find out how far apart these stations are.\n\nFirst, I should remember the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nI know the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 30 minutes. But wait, the time is in minutes, and the speed is in hours. I need to make sure the units match. So, I should convert 30 minutes into hours.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, time is 0.5 hours.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 0.5 hours = 30 miles\n\nSo, the distance between the two stations is 30 miles.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If the train is going at 60 miles per hour, that means it can travel 60 miles in one hour. In half an hour, it should cover half of that distance, which is 30 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of rates. If the train travels 60 miles in 60 minutes, then in 30 minutes, it would travel 30 miles. Same answer.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
