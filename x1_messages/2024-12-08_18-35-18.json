        "content": "The process in evolutionary biology where characteristics of species change over several generations through natural selection is known as evolution. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Evolution.\n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly discuss the other options to ensure a comprehensive understanding:\n\nA. Genetic drift: This refers to random changes in allele frequencies within a population over generations. It's more prominent in small populations and can lead to significant genetic changes without any particular advantage or disadvantage.\n\nB. Mutation: This is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism. Mutations can be caused by errors during DNA replication or by environmental factors like radiation. They introduce genetic variation upon which natural selection can act.\n\nD. Speciation: This is the process by which new biological species arise. It occurs when populations of a species become isolated from each other, either geographically or reproductively, and evolve independently over time.\n\nWhile all these processes play a role in evolutionary biology, it's evolution that specifically encompasses the change in species characteristics over generations through natural selection.\n\n## Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
