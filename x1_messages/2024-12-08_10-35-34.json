        "content": "Sure! Below is a simple Java program that simulates a basic ATM machine. This program uses object-oriented programming principles to model bank accounts and transactions.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\nclass BankAccount {\n    private double balance;\n\n    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {\n        this.balance = initialBalance;\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n            System.out.println(\"Deposited: $\" + amount);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid amount.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {\n            balance -= amount;\n            System.out.println(\"Withdrew: $\" + amount);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid amount or insufficient funds.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ATM Simulator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000.0); // Starting balance\n\n        int choice;\n        do {\n            System.out.println(\"\\nATM Menu:\");\n            System.out.println(\"1. Check Balance\");\n            System.out.println(\"2. Deposit Money\");\n            System.out.println(\"3. Withdraw Money\");\n            System.out.println(\"4. Exit\");\n            System.out.print(\"Enter your choice: \");\n            choice = scanner.nextInt();\n\n            switch (choice) {\n                case 1:\n                    System.out.println(\"Current Balance: $\" + account.getBalance());\n                    break;\n                case 2:\n                    System.out.print(\"Enter amount to deposit: $\");\n                    double depositAmount = scanner.nextDouble();\n                    account.deposit(depositAmount);\n                    break;\n                case 3:\n                    System.out.print(\"Enter amount to withdraw: $\");\n                    double withdrawAmount = scanner.nextDouble();\n                    account.withdraw(withdrawAmount);\n                    break;\n                case 4:\n                    System.out.println(\"Exiting...\");\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n            }\n        } while (choice != 4);\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **BankAccount Class**:\n   - This class models a bank account with a balance.\n   - It has methods to get the balance, deposit money, and withdraw money.\n   - The `deposit` method adds the specified amount to the balance if the amount is positive.\n   - The `withdraw` method subtracts the specified amount from the balance if the amount is positive and sufficient funds are available.\n\n2. **ATM Simulator Class**:\n   - This class contains the main method and simulates the ATM machine.\n   - It uses a `Scanner` to read user inputs.\n   - A `BankAccount` object is created with an initial balance of $1000.\n   - A menu is displayed to the user with options to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or exit.\n   - Based on the user's choice, the corresponding operation is performed.\n   - The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.\n\nThis program provides a basic simulation of an ATM and can be extended with more features like multiple accounts, transaction history, etc."
