Here's a Python function that counts the frequency of each character in a given string:\n\n```python\ndef char_frequency(string):\n    frequency = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if char in frequency:\n            frequency[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[char] = 1\n    return frequency\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"hello world\"\nresult = char_frequency(input_string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each character in the input string and maintains a dictionary to count the frequency of each character. You can test it with different strings to see how it works."
