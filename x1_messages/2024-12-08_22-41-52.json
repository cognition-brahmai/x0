        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. So, the original price of the product is $80. First, there's a 25% discount applied to that. After that, customers get an additional 10% off on the already discounted price. I need to find out what the final price is after both discounts.\n\nOkay, so starting with the first discount: 25% off of $80. To calculate that, I can multiply 80 by 25% (or 0.25 in decimal form). So, 80 times 0.25 is 20. That means the first discount is $20.\n\nNow, subtract that discount from the original price: 80 minus 20 equals $60. So, after the first discount, the price is $60.\n\nNext, there's an additional 10% off on this discounted price of $60. Again, to find 10% of 60, I multiply 60 by 10% (or 0.10). So, 60 times 0.10 is 6. That means the second discount is $6.\n\nSubtract that second discount from the already discounted price: 60 minus 6 equals $54.\n\nTherefore, the final price of the product after both discounts are applied is $54.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Sometimes, stores apply discounts differently, but in this case, it seems straightforward. First, a 25% discount on the original price, then an additional 10% on the new price.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to calculate this. Maybe by combining the discounts or something. But no, since the additional discount is applied to the already discounted price, it's correct to apply them one after the other.\n\nSo, original price: $80.\n\nFirst discount: 25% of 80 is $20, so 80 - 20 = $60.\n\nSecond discount: 10% of 60 is $6, so 60 - 6 = $54.\n\nYes, the final price is $54.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
