        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden has a length of 15 meters and a width of 8 meters. I need to find the area of the garden, and then find the new area if the length is increased by 50% and the width is decreased by 25%. Alright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for the area of a rectangle. I think it's length multiplied by width. So, area equals length times width. That makes sense because area is basically the space inside the rectangle, and multiplying the length and width gives us that.\n\nSo, for the original garden, the area would be 15 meters times 8 meters. Let me do that calculation: 15 times 8 is 120. So, the area is 120 square meters. Okay, that's the first part.\n\nNow, for the second part, the length is increased by 50%, and the width is decreased by 25%. I need to find the new dimensions first and then calculate the new area.\n\nLet's start with the length. The original length is 15 meters, and it's increased by 50%. To find 50% of 15, I can calculate 0.5 times 15, which is 7.5 meters. So, the new length is 15 meters plus 7.5 meters, which equals 22.5 meters.\n\nNext, the width is decreased by 25%. The original width is 8 meters. To find 25% of 8, I can calculate 0.25 times 8, which is 2 meters. So, the new width is 8 meters minus 2 meters, which equals 6 meters.\n\nNow, with the new length and width, I can find the new area. Again, area is length times width, so 22.5 meters times 6 meters. Let's do that multiplication: 22.5 times 6.\n\nI can break it down: 20 times 6 is 120, and 2.5 times 6 is 15. So, 120 plus 15 equals 135 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, that seems higher than the original area of 120 square meters. Is that possible? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nOriginal area: 15 times 8 is indeed 120 square meters.\n\nNew length: 15 plus 50% of 15 is 15 plus 7.5, which is 22.5 meters.\n\nNew width: 8 minus 25% of 8 is 8 minus 2, which is 6 meters.\n\nNew area: 22.5 times 6.\n\nLet me verify 22.5 times 6 again. 20 times 6 is 120, and 2.5 times 6 is 15, so 120 plus 15 is 135 square meters.\n\nHmm, so the new area is 135 square meters, which is larger than the original area of 120 square meters. Is that makes sense?\n\nWell, the length increased by 50% and the width decreased by 25%. So, even though the width is decreasing, the larger increase in length is making the overall area bigger.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of percentages. The original area is length times width. If the length increases by 50%, that's multiplying the length by 1.5. If the width decreases by 25%, that's multiplying the width by 0.75.\n\nSo, the new area would be (1.5 times original length) times (0.75 times original width), which is 1.5 times 0.75 times the original area.\n\n1.5 times 0.75 is 1.125, which means the new area is 1.125 times the original area.\n\nSo, 1.125 times 120 is 135 square meters, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the new area is indeed 135 square meters.\n\nWait, but is there another way to look at this? Maybe using ratios or something else.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of the new area to the original area.\n\nNew area over original area equals (new length times new width) divided by (original length times original width).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n(22.5 times 6) divided by (15 times 8) equals 135 divided by 120, which simplifies to 1.125.\n\nAgain, that's a 12.5% increase in area.\n\nIs there a general rule here? If you increase the length by a certain percentage and decrease the width by another percentage, how does that affect the area?\n\nIn this case, increasing the length by 50% and decreasing the width by 25% results in a 12.5% increase in area.\n\nMaybe I can generalize this. If I have an original area, and I multiply the length by a factor of (1 + percentage increase) and the width by a factor of (1 - percentage decrease), then the new area is the original area multiplied by those two factors.\n\nSo, new area equals original area times (1 + percentage increase in length) times (1 - percentage decrease in width).\n\nIn this case, that's 120 times 1.5 times 0.75, which is 120 times 1.125, equaling 135 square meters.\n\nThis seems consistent across both methods I've used.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try calculating the percentage changes differently.\n\nSuppose I calculate the percentage change in area directly.\n\nPercentage change in area equals (new area minus original area) divided by original area, times 100%.\n\nSo, (135 - 120) divided by 120 times 100% equals 15 divided by 120 times 100%, which is 0.125 times 100%, equaling 12.5%.\n\nAgain, that matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the percentage changes in length and width, I might try to add them or something, but that's probably not accurate for area changes.\n\nBecause area is a two-dimensional measurement, changes in length and width multiply, not add.\n\nSo, adding a 50% increase and a 25% decrease wouldn't make sense directly. Instead, you have to multiply the factors.\n\nWait, some people might try to calculate the net percentage change in area by adding the percentage changes in length and width, but that's incorrect because area is a product of length and width, not a sum.\n\nSo, it's important to remember that for areas, you need to multiply the scaling factors.\n\nIn this case, multiplying a 50% increase (which is a multiplication by 1.5) and a 25% decrease (which is a multiplication by 0.75) gives a net multiplication factor of 1.125, or a 12.5% increase in area.\n\nThis is a good reminder that when dealing with areas, percentage changes in dimensions don't add; they multiply.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered this problem sufficiently.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Original area: 15 meters times 8 meters equals 120 square meters.\n\n- New length: 15 meters plus 50% of 15 meters equals 22.5 meters.\n\n- New width: 8 meters minus 25% of 8 meters equals 6 meters.\n\n- New area: 22.5 meters times 6 meters equals 135 square meters.\n\n- Alternatively, using scaling factors: 1.5 times 0.75 equals 1.125, so the new area is 1.125 times the original area, which is 135 square meters.\n\n- Percentage change in area: 12.5% increase.\n\nI'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe original area of the garden is \\boxed{120} square meters, and the new area after increasing the length by 50% and decreasing the width by 25% is \\boxed{135} square meters."
