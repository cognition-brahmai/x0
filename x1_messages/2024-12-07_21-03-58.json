        "content": "So, the car is going at 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours to get to its destination. I need to find out how far the destination is in miles. I remember that distance, speed, and time are related, but I'm not exactly sure how to calculate it. Maybe I can use the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, if the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 2 hours, then the distance should be 60 times 2, which is 120 miles. Does that make sense? I think that's the answer, but let me double-check. If I travel at 60 miles per hour for one hour, I would cover 60 miles, and for two hours, it should be 120 miles. Yeah, that seems right. [Final Answer] \\boxed{120}"
