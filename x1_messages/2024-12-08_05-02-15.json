        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 20 students: 12 boys and 8 girls. The teacher is going to randomly pick two students, and we need to find out the probability that both of them are girls.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event is selecting two girls from the class.\n\nSo, let's identify the total number of possible outcomes when selecting two students from 20. This is a combination problem because the order in which we select the students doesn't matter. It's about choosing two students out of 20, regardless of the order.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the total number of items,\n\n- k is the number of items to choose,\n\n- n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 students out of 20 is:\n\nC(20, 2) = 20! / (2!(20 - 2)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 18!) = (20 \u00d7 19) / 2 = 190.\n\nSo, there are 190 possible pairs of students that can be selected.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 8.\n\nUsing the combination formula again:\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 28.\n\nSo, there are 28 possible pairs of girls that can be selected.\n\nNow, the probability that both selected students are girls is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of ways to choose 2 girls / Total number of ways to choose 2 students = 28 / 190.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n28 \u00f7 2 = 14\n\n190 \u00f7 2 = 95\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 14/95.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal or a percentage.\n\nTo convert 14/95 to a decimal, we divide 14 by 95:\n\n14 \u00f7 95 \u2248 0.147368...\n\nRounded to four decimal places, that's approximately 0.1474.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply the decimal by 100:\n\n0.1474 \u00d7 100 \u2248 14.74%.\n\nSo, the probability that both selected students are girls is 14.74%.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to think about it step by step, considering the probability of selecting one girl and then another girl.\n\nFirst, the probability of selecting one girl from the class.\n\nThere are 8 girls out of 20 students, so the probability is 8/20.\n\nSimplify that fraction: 8/20 = 2/5.\n\nNow, given that the first student selected is a girl, there are now 7 girls left and 19 students in total.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting another girl is 7/19.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening (selecting two girls in a row), we multiply the probabilities:\n\n(2/5) \u00d7 (7/19) = (2 \u00d7 7) / (5 \u00d7 19) = 14/95.\n\nThat matches what we got earlier using combinations.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, we arrive at the same answer: 14/95, or approximately 14.74%.\n\nIt's always good to verify results using different approaches to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this problem.\n\nSuppose we think about permutations instead of combinations. In permutations, the order matters. But in this case, since we're just selecting two students without regard to order, combinations are the appropriate choice.\n\nHowever, for the sake of exploration, let's see what happens if we use permutations.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to select two students in order from 20 is:\n\nP(20, 2) = 20 \u00d7 19 = 380.\n\nNow, the number of ways to select two girls in order from 8 is:\n\nP(8, 2) = 8 \u00d7 7 = 56.\n\nSo, the probability would be 56 / 380.\n\nSimplify that fraction:\n\n56 \u00f7 4 = 14\n\n380 \u00f7 4 = 95\n\nAgain, we get 14/95.\n\nThis confirms that whether we use combinations or permutations, we arrive at the same probability.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that in probability calculations, the key is to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are counting the same type of events (i.e., both are counting ordered pairs or both are counting unordered pairs).\n\nIn this case, using combinations or permutations is acceptable, as long as consistency is maintained.\n\nAnother angle to consider: what if the teacher selects the students one at a time, with replacement? Would that change the probability?\n\nIn our original problem, the selection is without replacement, meaning once a student is selected, they can't be selected again.\n\nIf there were replacement, the teacher could potentially select the same student twice.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's specified that the teacher selects two distinct students, so replacement is not allowed.\n\nLet's see how probability changes with replacement, just for comparison.\n\nIf selection is with replacement:\n\n- The probability of selecting a girl first is 8/20.\n\n- Since we replace the first student, the probability of selecting a girl second is also 8/20.\n\n- Therefore, the probability of selecting two girls with replacement is (8/20) \u00d7 (8/20) = (8/20)^2 = 64/400 = 16/100 = 0.16 or 16%.\n\nCompare that to the without replacement scenario, where it was approximately 14.74%.\n\nSo, with replacement, the probability is slightly higher.\n\nBut again, in this problem, selection is without replacement, so 14/95 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that could influence this probability.\n\nFor example, are there any students who are neither boys nor girls? The problem states there are 12 boys and 8 girls, totaling 20 students, so no, there are no other categories.\n\nIs there any bias in selection? The problem says the teacher selects students randomly, so each student should have an equal chance of being selected.\n\nTherefore, our calculation stands.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the general formula for the probability of selecting k successes (in this case, girls) from a population of size N (20 students) with S successes (8 girls), without replacement.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nProbability = [C(S, k) \u00d7 C(N - S, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(S, k) is the number of ways to choose k girls from S,\n\n- C(N - S, n - k) is the number of ways to choose the remaining n - k students from the boys,\n\n- C(N, n) is the total number of ways to choose n students from N.\n\nIn our problem:\n\n- N = 20,\n\n- S = 8,\n\n- n = 2,\n\n- k = 2.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nProbability = [C(8, 2) \u00d7 C(20 - 8, 2 - 2)] / C(20, 2) = [28 \u00d7 C(12, 0)] / 190.\n\nNow, C(12, 0) = 1 (since there's only one way to choose zero students from 12).\n\nTherefore, Probability = (28 \u00d7 1) / 190 = 28 / 190 = 14 / 95.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis reinforces our confidence in the answer.\n\nLet's consider a similar problem to ensure understanding.\n\nSuppose in a different class, there are 10 students: 6 boys and 4 girls. What is the probability that two randomly selected students are both boys?\n\nUsing the combination approach:\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 students from 10: C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nWays to choose 2 boys from 6: C(6, 2) = 15.\n\nTherefore, probability = 15 / 45 = 1/3 \u2248 33.33%.\n\nUsing the step-by-step approach:\n\nProbability of first student being a boy: 6/10.\n\nGiven that, probability of second student being a boy: 5/9.\n\nTherefore, combined probability: (6/10) \u00d7 (5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3 \u2248 33.33%.\n\nAgain, consistent results.\n\nThis similar problem helps confirm that our approach to the original question is correct.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that both selected students are girls in the original problem is 14/95, or approximately 14.74%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}} \\]"
