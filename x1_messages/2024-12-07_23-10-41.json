        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have John who has twice as many sisters as brothers, and his sister Julia has only half as many sisters as brothers. We need to find out how many sons and daughters their parents have.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the relationships here. John has some brothers and sisters, and Julia, who is his sister, has her own brothers and sisters. The tricky part is keeping track of who is counting whom.\n\nLet's define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys (sons) in the family.\n\n- Let \\( g \\) represent the number of girls (daughters) in the family.\n\nNow, John has twice as many sisters as brothers. John is a boy, so his brothers are the other boys in the family, and his sisters are the girls in the family.\n\nSo, the number of John's brothers is \\( b - 1 \\) (since he doesn't count himself). The number of his sisters is \\( g \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, John has twice as many sisters as brothers, so:\n\n\\[ g = 2(b - 1) \\]\n\nThat's our first equation.\n\nNext, Julia is John's sister, so she's a girl. She has half as many sisters as brothers. So, for Julia, her sisters are the other girls in the family, which is \\( g - 1 \\), and her brothers are the boys in the family, which is \\( b \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Julia has half as many sisters as brothers, so:\n\n\\[ g - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\]\n\nThat's our second equation.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( g = 2(b - 1) \\)\n\n2. \\( g - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\)\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \\( b \\) and \\( g \\).\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = 2(b - 1) \\]\n\n\\[ g = 2b - 2 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( g \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[ (2b - 2) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\]\n\n\\[ 2b - 3 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( b \\). First, subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2} b \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2b - \\frac{1}{2} b - 3 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{2} b - \\frac{1}{2} b - 3 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2} b - 3 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, add 3 to both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2} b = 3 \\]\n\nNow, multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ b = 3 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ b = 2 \\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. If \\( b = 2 \\), let's check it with the first equation:\n\n\\[ g = 2(2 - 1) \\]\n\n\\[ g = 2(1) \\]\n\n\\[ g = 2 \\]\n\nNow, let's check with the second equation:\n\n\\[ g - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\]\n\n\\[ 2 - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 = 1 \\]\n\nOkay, that checks out. So, there are 2 boys and 2 girls in the family.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's think about this again. If there are 2 boys and 2 girls, then John has one brother and two sisters. So, twice as many sisters as brothers would be 2 = 2*1, which holds true.\n\nJulia has one sister and two brothers. Half as many sisters as brothers would be 1 = 0.5 * 2, which is also true.\n\nSo, the solution seems to be 2 boys and 2 girls.\n\nBut I remember similar problems where the answer isn't so straightforward, so maybe I should consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the equations differently. Let me try again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( b \\) is the number of boys (excluding John).\n\n- \\( g \\) is the number of girls (excluding John's sisters).\n\nWait, that might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of total children.\n\nLet\u2019s say there are \\( b \\) boys and \\( g \\) girls in total.\n\nThen, John has \\( b - 1 \\) brothers and \\( g \\) sisters.\n\nGiven that John has twice as many sisters as brothers:\n\n\\[ g = 2(b - 1) \\]\n\nAnd Julia has \\( g - 1 \\) sisters and \\( b \\) brothers.\n\nGiven that Julia has half as many sisters as brothers:\n\n\\[ g - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\]\n\nSo, we have the same equations as before:\n\n1. \\( g = 2(b - 1) \\)\n\n2. \\( g - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\)\n\nWe can solve the first equation for \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = 2b - 2 \\]\n\nPlug this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ (2b - 2) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\]\n\n\\[ 2b - 3 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[ 4b - 6 = b \\]\n\nSubtract \\( b \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3b - 6 = 0 \\]\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 3b = 6 \\]\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n\\[ b = 2 \\]\n\nNow, plug back into the first equation:\n\n\\[ g = 2(2) - 2 \\]\n\n\\[ g = 4 - 2 \\]\n\n\\[ g = 2 \\]\n\nSo, there are 2 boys and 2 girls in total.\n\nBut earlier, I thought this seemed too straightforward. Maybe there's a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe using different variables.\n\nLet\u2019s let \\( s \\) be the number of sons (boys) and \\( d \\) be the number of daughters (girls).\n\nThen, John has \\( s - 1 \\) brothers and \\( d \\) sisters.\n\nGiven that John has twice as many sisters as brothers:\n\n\\[ d = 2(s - 1) \\]\n\nJulia has \\( d - 1 \\) sisters and \\( s \\) brothers.\n\nGiven that Julia has half as many sisters as brothers:\n\n\\[ d - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} s \\]\n\nSo, again, the same equations:\n\n1. \\( d = 2(s - 1) \\)\n\n2. \\( d - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} s \\)\n\nSolving the first equation for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ d = 2s - 2 \\]\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\n\\[ (2s - 2) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} s \\]\n\n\\[ 2s - 3 = \\frac{1}{2} s \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ 4s - 6 = s \\]\n\nSubtract \\( s \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3s - 6 = 0 \\]\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 3s = 6 \\]\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n\\[ s = 2 \\]\n\nThen, \\( d = 2(2) - 2 = 2 \\)\n\nSo, again, 2 sons and 2 daughters.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the parents have John and his siblings, so perhaps the total number of children is 4.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 2 boys and 2 girls:\n\n- John has 1 brother and 2 sisters. So, twice as many sisters as brothers: 2 = 2*1, which holds.\n\n- Julia has 1 sister and 2 brothers. So, half as many sisters as brothers: 1 = 0.5*2, which also holds.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose we consider that John has twice as many sisters as brothers besides himself.\n\nWait, the problem says \"John has twice as many sisters as brothers.\" This typically means his sisters and brothers besides himself.\n\nSimilarly, \"Julia has only half as many sisters as brothers.\" Julia is a sister, so her sisters are the other girls, and brothers are the boys.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of sisters and brothers exclude themselves.\n\nIn standard terminology, siblings exclude oneself.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the equations differently.\n\nLet\u2019s try to set up the equations again.\n\nLet\u2019s say there are \\( b \\) boys and \\( g \\) girls in the family.\n\nThen, John has \\( b - 1 \\) brothers and \\( g \\) sisters.\n\nGiven that \\( g = 2(b - 1) \\)\n\nSimilarly, Julia has \\( g - 1 \\) sisters and \\( b \\) brothers.\n\nGiven that \\( g - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\)\n\nSo, again, the same equations.\n\nSolving them gives \\( b = 2 \\) and \\( g = 2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the parents have 2 sons and 2 daughters.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there could be more solutions.\n\nSuppose there are more boys or girls.\n\nWait, if I plug in \\( b = 3 \\), then from the first equation:\n\n\\[ g = 2(3 - 1) = 4 \\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n\\[ g - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} b \\]\n\n\\[ 4 - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ 3 = 1.5 \\]\n\nWhich is not true.\n\nSo, \\( b = 3 \\) doesn't work.\n\nIf \\( b = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ g = 2(1 - 1) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ g - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\]\n\n\\[ -1 = 0.5 \\]\n\nWhich is also not true.\n\nSo, only \\( b = 2 \\) and \\( g = 2 \\) satisfy both equations.\n\nTherefore, the parents have 2 sons and 2 daughters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ sons and } 2 \\text{ daughters}} \\]"
