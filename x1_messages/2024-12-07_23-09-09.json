The company needs to allocate resources for food, entertainment, and staff salaries. Assuming an average daily expense of $100 per passenger for food and entertainment, and an average staff salary of $2000 per month (with 500 staff members), calculate the total annual operating cost for the cruise ship. Additionally, determine the minimum ticket price needed to cover these expenses if the company aims for a 20% profit margin."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a cruise ship company that offers vacations from 7 to 14 days. The ship can carry up to 3000 passengers and operates all year round. We need to figure out the total annual operating cost, considering expenses for food, entertainment, and staff salaries. Then, we have to find out the minimum ticket price to cover these costs, aiming for a 20% profit margin.\n\nFirst, let's break down the expenses:\n\n1. **Food and Entertainment:**\n\n   - The average daily expense per passenger is $100.\n\n   - The ship can carry 3000 passengers.\n\n   - The ship operates year-round, so we need to calculate the annual cost.\n\n   But wait, the vacation packages range from 7 to 14 days. Does that mean passengers are always on board for either 7 or 14 days? Or is it a mix? For simplicity, maybe we can assume that on average, passengers are on board for 10.5 days (the midpoint between 7 and 14).\n\n   So, average trip length = (7 + 14)/2 = 10.5 days.\n\n   Now, if the ship is always full, meaning 3000 passengers are on board at any given time, but since passengers are coming and going, we need to figure out how many passenger-days there are in a year.\n\n   Let's calculate the number of passenger trips per year.\n\n   There are 365 days in a year.\n\n   If a trip is 10.5 days on average, then the number of trips per year per passenger slot is 365 / 10.5 \u2248 34.76 trips.\n\n   But since the ship has 3000 passenger slots, the total number of passenger trips per year is 3000 * 34.76 \u2248 104,286 trips.\n\n   Now, each trip is 10.5 days, so total passenger-days per year is 104,286 trips * 10.5 days/trip = 1,094,997 passenger-days.\n\n   At $100 per passenger-day, the total annual expense for food and entertainment is 1,094,997 * $100 = $109,499,700.\n\n   That's a huge number! Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\n   Let me try another way.\n\n   Since the ship operates year-round and has a capacity of 3000 passengers, perhaps it's better to think in terms of daily occupancy.\n\n   Assuming the ship is always full, meaning 3000 passengers per day.\n\n   Therefore, daily expense for food and entertainment is 3000 * $100 = $300,000 per day.\n\n   Annual expense would be $300,000 * 365 = $109,500,000.\n\n   Wait, that's almost the same as my earlier calculation, but simpler. So, $109,500,000 per year for food and entertainment.\n\n2. **Staff Salaries:**\n\n   - There are 500 staff members.\n\n   - Each staff member earns an average of $2000 per month.\n\n   - Therefore, monthly salary expense is 500 * $2000 = $1,000,000 per month.\n\n   - Annual salary expense is $1,000,000 * 12 = $12,000,000 per year.\n\nNow, total annual operating cost is the sum of food, entertainment, and staff salaries.\n\nTotal annual operating cost = $109,500,000 + $12,000,000 = $121,500,000.\n\nNext, we need to determine the minimum ticket price to cover these expenses, aiming for a 20% profit margin.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a 20% profit margin means. A 20% profit margin means that the company wants to make 20% profit on top of the cost.\n\nSo, if the total revenue is R and the total cost is C, then profit is R - C.\n\nGiven that profit should be 20% of the cost, we have:\n\nProfit = 0.2 * C\n\nTherefore, R - C = 0.2 * C\n\nWhich implies R = C + 0.2 * C = 1.2 * C\n\nSo, total revenue needed is 1.2 times the total annual operating cost.\n\nTotal revenue needed = 1.2 * $121,500,000 = $145,800,000.\n\nNow, to find the minimum ticket price, we need to know how many tickets are sold per year.\n\nGiven that the ship has 3000 passenger capacity and operates 365 days a year, with trip lengths averaging 10.5 days, we can use the earlier calculation for the number of passenger trips per year.\n\nNumber of passenger trips per year is 104,286.\n\nTherefore, total revenue needed is $145,800,000, and number of tickets sold per year is 104,286.\n\nSo, minimum ticket price = total revenue needed / number of tickets sold\n\nMinimum ticket price = $145,800,000 / 104,286 \u2248 $1,400 per ticket.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total annual operating cost is $121,500,000.\n\nTotal revenue needed for 20% profit is $145,800,000.\n\nNumber of passenger trips per year is 104,286.\n\nTherefore, $145,800,000 / 104,286 \u2248 $1,400 per ticket.\n\nHmm, that does seem high, but according to the calculations, it's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company doesn't operate at full capacity all the time. Perhaps there's a occupancy rate to consider. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume it's always full.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other expenses to consider, like maintenance, fuel, etc., but the problem only mentions food, entertainment, and staff salaries.\n\nSo, based on the given information, the minimum ticket price needed to cover the expenses with a 20% profit margin is approximately $1,400 per ticket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total annual operating cost for the cruise ship is \\boxed{121500000} dollars, and the minimum ticket price needed to cover these expenses with a 20% profit margin is approximately \\boxed{1400} dollars per ticket."
