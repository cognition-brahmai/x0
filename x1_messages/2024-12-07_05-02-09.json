        "content": "So the library has 5,000 books, and the librarian wants to replace 30% of them with new titles. Each new book costs $20, and we need to find out how much it will cost in total to replace those books.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many books are being replaced. Since it's 30% of 5,000, I can calculate that by multiplying 5,000 by 30% or 0.30.\n\nSo, number of books to replace = 5,000 * 0.30\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n5,000 * 0.30 = 1,500 books\n\nAlright, so 1,500 books need to be replaced.\n\nEach new book costs $20, so to find the total cost, I need to multiply the number of new books by the cost per book.\n\nTotal cost = number of new books * cost per book\n\nWhich is 1,500 * $20\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n1,500 * 20 = $30,000\n\nSo, it will cost $30,000 to replace the books.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there any additional cost or anything that might affect the total cost?\n\nWell, the question seems straightforward. It's just about replacing a certain percentage of books with new ones at a given cost per book. There doesn't seem to be any additional information or extra costs mentioned.\n\nSo, I think $30,000 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, 30% of 5,000 is indeed 1,500 books.\n\nThen, 1,500 books times $20 each is $30,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 30% of the total number of books are being replaced, and each replacement costs $20, so the total cost is 30% of 5,000 multiplied by $20, which is what I did.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find 30% of the total cost of all books, but that wouldn't make sense because we're replacing books at a new cost per book, not based on the original cost of the books being replaced.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total cost to replace the books is $30,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000} \\]"
