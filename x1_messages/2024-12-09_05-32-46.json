Mahatma Gandhi was not a mathematician, nor did he guide India towards technological progress through peaceful methods, although he was indeed known for his advocacy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Gandhi played a significant role in India's struggle for independence from British rule, using peaceful methods such as protests, boycotts, and hunger strikes. He is widely regarded as the father of the nation in India.\n\nAs for the date of his death, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, not February 28, 1950, due to political reasons.\n\nThis information is from Britannica, a well-known encyclopedia.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Britannica (2021).
