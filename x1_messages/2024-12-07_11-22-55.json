        "content": "So the bee visits flowers and then goes back to the hive. On the first day, it visits 7 flowers and then returns to the hive. That seems straightforward. The next day, it does the same thing but visits twice as many flowers before returning to the hive. So, twice as many as 7 would be 14 flowers on the second day.\n\nTo find the total number of flowers visited over the two days, I just need to add the flowers visited each day together. So, 7 flowers on the first day plus 14 flowers on the second day.\n\nLet me write that down: 7 + 14.\n\nAdding those together gives me 21.\n\nSo, the bee visited a total of 21 flowers over the two days.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. On the first day, it visits 7 flowers. On the second day, it visits twice as many as the first day, which is 2 times 7, equaling 14. Then, adding those together, 7 plus 14 is indeed 21.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other aspect to this problem. For example, does the bee visiting the hive affect the count? The question says it visits flowers and then returns to the hive, but it doesn't say that visiting the hive is equivalent to visiting a flower. So, I assume returning to the hive doesn't add to the flower count.\n\nAlso, the question is about the total flowers visited over the two days, not about the path or anything like that. So, it's just a matter of adding the numbers together.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the bee visits the same flowers again or different ones. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think we can assume that it's visiting different flowers each day, and we're just to add the numbers together.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the bee visited a total of 21 flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
