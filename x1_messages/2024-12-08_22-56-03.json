        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a car travels 180 miles on 12 gallons of gas, and I need to find out its fuel efficiency in miles per gallon. Alright, fuel efficiency is basically how many miles the car can travel per gallon of gas. So, if it goes 180 miles on 12 gallons, I think I just need to divide the miles by the gallons to get miles per gallon.\n\nLet me write that down: miles per gallon = miles traveled / gallons used. So, that's 180 miles / 12 gallons. Now, doing the division: 180 divided by 12. Well, 12 times 15 is 180, so it should be 15 miles per gallon.\n\nBut wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If the car travels 180 miles on 12 gallons, then per gallon, it should travel 180 divided by 12 miles. Yeah, that's 15 miles per gallon.\n\nI think that makes sense. Another way to think about it is to see how many miles it travels per gallon. So, if 12 gallons take it 180 miles, then one gallon would take it 180 divided by 12 miles, which is 15 miles. So, 15 miles per gallon.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check this with another method. Let's see, maybe I can use proportions. If 12 gallons correspond to 180 miles, then 1 gallon would correspond to x miles, where x is what we're trying to find. So, 12 gallons / 180 miles = 1 gallon / x miles. Wait, actually, that might not be the best way to set it up. Maybe it's better to think of it as a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of unit rates. The unit rate here would be miles per gallon, which is what we're looking for. So, miles per gallon is the distance traveled divided by the fuel consumed. So again, 180 miles / 12 gallons = 15 miles per gallon.\n\nHmm, I feel like I'm repeating the same calculation, but in different ways, and I keep getting 15 miles per gallon. Maybe I'm overthinking this. Perhaps it's straightforward, and the answer is indeed 15 miles per gallon.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should be considering. Is there ever a situation where fuel efficiency isn't just miles traveled divided by gallons used? I think in basic terms, that's what it is. Unless there are other variables involved, like driving conditions or something, but in this problem, it's just giving me the total miles and the total gallons used.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that the fuel efficiency is 15 miles per gallon. I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
