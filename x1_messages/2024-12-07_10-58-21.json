        "content": "Let's see. The total bill was $120, and each person paid $30. They split the bill evenly, so to find out how many people were in the group, I need to divide the total bill by the amount each person paid. So, $120 divided by $30 per person should give me the number of people.\n\nLet me do the math: 120 divided by 30 is 4. So, there were 4 people in the group.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If each person paid $30 and there were 4 people, then 4 times 30 is indeed 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as sharing the total cost among the number of people, so the equation would be:\n\nTotal bill = number of people \u00d7 amount per person\n\nSo, 120 = n \u00d7 30\n\nTo find n, I divide both sides by 30:\n\nn = 120 / 30 = 4\n\nYeah, that seems straightforward. I don't think there's anything else to consider here. The answer is 4 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
