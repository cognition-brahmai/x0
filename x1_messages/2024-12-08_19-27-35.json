However, it's important to note that the Philosopher's Stone doesn't actually bring people back from the dead, but it can be used to create the Elixir of Life, which grants the drinker immortality. The stone also has the ability to turn any metal into pure gold, as you mentioned. This makes it one of the most powerful and sought-after magical objects in the Harry Potter universe."
