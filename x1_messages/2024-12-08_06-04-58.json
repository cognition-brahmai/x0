        "content": "The integral you've presented, \u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of e^(-x\u00b2) dx, is a very famous integral in mathematics and physics, often referred to as the Gaussian integral. Its value is \u221a\u03c0, which is approximately 1.77245385091. This result might seem surprising at first glance because the antiderivative of e^(-x\u00b2) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, yet the definite integral over the entire real line has a neat closed-form solution.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, there are several methods, but I'll outline one of the most common approaches, which involves squaring the integral and converting to polar coordinates. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Define the integral**: Let I = \u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of e^(-x\u00b2) dx.\n\n2. **Square the integral**: Consider I\u00b2 = [\u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of e^(-x\u00b2) dx] * [\u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of e^(-y\u00b2) dy]. Here, we've introduced a dummy variable y for the second integral.\n\n3. **Convert to a double integral**: Since both integrals are over the entire real line and the integrand is a product of functions of x and y, we can write I\u00b2 as a double integral over the entire xy-plane: I\u00b2 = \u222b from -\u221e to \u221e \u222b from -\u221e to \u221e e^(-x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) dx dy.\n\n4. **Switch to polar coordinates**: To evaluate this double integral, it's convenient to switch to polar coordinates, where x = r cos(\u03b8) and y = r sin(\u03b8), and the Jacobian determinant of the transformation is r. Thus, dx dy = r dr d\u03b8.\n\n5. **Set up the polar integral**: Substituting into the double integral, we get I\u00b2 = \u222b from 0 to 2\u03c0 \u222b from 0 to \u221e e^(-r\u00b2) r dr d\u03b8.\n\n6. **Evaluate the inner integral**: First, integrate with respect to r. Let u = r\u00b2, so du = 2r dr, and the integral becomes (1/2) \u222b e^(-u) du from u=0 to u=\u221e, which evaluates to (1/2)(0 - (-1)) = 1/2.\n\n7. **Evaluate the outer integral**: Now, integrate with respect to \u03b8: \u222b from 0 to 2\u03c0 (1/2) d\u03b8 = (1/2)(2\u03c0) = \u03c0.\n\n8. **Take the square root**: Since I\u00b2 = \u03c0, we have I = \u221a\u03c0. (We take the positive square root because the integral represents an area, which is positive.)\n\nThis method is quite elegant and demonstrates a clever way to evaluate an integral that couldn't be solved directly using elementary techniques. The Gaussian integral has wide applications in statistics, quantum mechanics, and many other fields.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\]"
