        "content": "The precious object you're referring to is the One Ring, also known as the Ruling Ring or the Great Ring of Power. In J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, the One Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Orodruin, also known as Mount Doom, in the Second Age. Its purpose was to control the other Rings of Power and, through them, the wills of the bearers of those rings, primarily the leaders of Middle-earth's various peoples.\n\nIn \"The Hobbit,\" Bilbo Baggins stumbles upon the One Ring while it is lost in the underground tunnels of the Misty Mountains, where it had been abandoned by Gollum, a hobbit-like creature who had possessed it for centuries. Bilbo takes the ring without knowing its significance and uses it occasionally for invisibility during his journey with Thorin and Company to the Lonely Mountain.\n\nLater, in \"The Lord of the Rings,\" the true nature of the ring is revealed. It is discovered that the One Ring holds a significant portion of Sauron's power and will, and its destruction is the only way to defeat him permanently. Bilbo passes the ring on to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, who becomes the Ring-bearer and undertakes the quest to destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged.\n\nThe One Ring's influence over its bearers is profound; it corrupts and enslaves them, making it extremely difficult to resist its power. This is why the quest to destroy it is so perilous and forms the central plot of \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nSo, without the One Ring, Bilbo's adventures would indeed have been quite different and likely less eventful, as it was the ring that played a key role in his encounters with Gollum and his subsequent involvement in the larger events of Middle-earth's history."
