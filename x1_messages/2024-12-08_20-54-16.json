I've included fields such as book title, author name, publisher name, borrower name, borrow date, and return date.\n\nFirst, let's create the database:\n\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE LibraryManagementSystem;\nUSE LibraryManagementSystem;\n```\n\nNext, we'll create the tables one by one.\n\n1. **Authors Table:**\n\nThis table will store information about the authors.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Authors (\n    AuthorID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(100),\n    LastName VARCHAR(100),\n    Biography TEXT\n);\n```\n\n2. **Publishers Table:**\n\nThis table will store information about the publishers.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Publishers (\n    PublisherID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Name VARCHAR(200),\n    Address VARCHAR(255),\n    Phone VARCHAR(15),\n    Email VARCHAR(100)\n);\n```\n\n3. **Books Table:**\n\nThis table will store information about the books, including references to authors and publishers.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Books (\n    BookID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Title VARCHAR(255),\n    ISBN VARCHAR(13),\n    PublicationYear YEAR,\n    AuthorID INT,\n    PublisherID INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Authors(AuthorID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (PublisherID) REFERENCES Publishers(PublisherID)\n);\n```\n\n4. **Borrowers Table:**\n\nThis table will store information about the borrowers.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Borrowers (\n    BorrowerID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(100),\n    LastName VARCHAR(100),\n    Address VARCHAR(255),\n    Phone VARCHAR(15),\n    Email VARCHAR(100)\n);\n```\n\n5. **Loans Table:**\n\nThis table will record the borrowing and returning of books by borrowers.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Loans (\n    LoanID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    BookID INT,\n    BorrowerID INT,\n    BorrowDate DATE,\n    ReturnDate DATE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (BorrowerID) REFERENCES Borrowers(BorrowerID)\n);\n```\n\nThese queries will set up a basic library management system database with the specified tables and fields. You can further enhance this schema by adding more details or constraints as needed."
