        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a square garden. The side length is 10 meters, and I need to figure out how much farther I walk if I go around the perimeter instead of cutting diagonally across the garden.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the perimeter is. Since it's a square, all four sides are equal, right? So, if each side is 10 meters, the total perimeter would be 4 times 10, which is 40 meters.\n\nNow, if I walk diagonally across the garden, I'm essentially going from one corner to the opposite corner in a straight line. I need to find out what that distance is.\n\nI remember that in a square, the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. For a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (which would be the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo, if the sides are both 10 meters, the diagonal d would be:\n\nd = \u221a(10\u00b2 + 10\u00b2) = \u221a(100 + 100) = \u221a200 \u2248 14.14 meters.\n\nWait, but I need to be precise here. \u221a200 is the same as \u221a(100 * 2) = 10\u221a2, which is approximately 14.1421356 meters.\n\nBut for this problem, maybe I should keep it in terms of \u221a2 to maintain precision.\n\nSo, the perimeter is 40 meters, and the diagonal is 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nNow, to find out how much farther walking around the perimeter is compared to walking diagonally, I need to subtract the diagonal distance from the perimeter.\n\nDifference = Perimeter - Diagonal = 40 - 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nHmm, but maybe I can factor out 10 to simplify this expression.\n\nDifference = 10(4 - \u221a2) meters.\n\nThat seems a bit more elegant.\n\nAlternatively, if I need a numerical value, I can approximate \u221a2 as 1.414.\n\nSo, difference \u2248 10(4 - 1.414) = 10(2.586) = 25.86 meters.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether to leave it in exact form or to approximate, so maybe I should provide both.\n\nSo, the difference is exactly 10(4 - \u221a2) meters, or approximately 25.86 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nPerimeter: 4 sides \u00d7 10 meters = 40 meters. That seems correct.\n\nDiagonal: 10\u221a2 meters, which is correct.\n\nDifference: 40 - 10\u221a2 meters. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that walking around the perimeter means walking along two sides (since it's a square), which would be 20 meters, but the problem says \"around the perimeter,\" which I think means the entire perimeter, not just two sides.\n\nWait, now I'm confusing myself. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"A square garden has a side length of 10 meters. If you walk around the perimeter of the garden, how much farther do you walk than if you walked diagonally across the garden?\"\n\nSo, walking around the perimeter means walking along all four sides, which is 40 meters.\n\nWalking diagonally is just across one diagonal, which is 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nTherefore, the difference is indeed 40 - 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to think about this. Perhaps using the properties of squares or other geometric relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of trigonometry. In a square, the angles are all 90 degrees, and the diagonals bisect the angles.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. To confirm, I can look up the formula for the perimeter of a square and the length of the diagonal.\n\nPerimeter of a square: P = 4s, where s is the side length.\n\nDiagonal of a square: d = s\u221a2.\n\nSo, P = 40 meters, d = 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nDifference: P - d = 40 - 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider walking around the perimeter as walking along two adjacent sides (which would be 20 meters), but the problem says \"around the perimeter,\" which typically means the entire boundary.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, \"walking around the perimeter\" could mean walking along part of the perimeter. Maybe the problem means walking from one corner to the opposite corner via the perimeter, which would be two sides, totaling 20 meters.\n\nIn that case, the difference would be 20 - 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nThat seems more plausible, because walking \"around the perimeter\" in this context might mean taking the path along the sides, which is two sides for corner to corner, rather than the entire perimeter.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf you're walking from one corner to the opposite corner via the perimeter, you would walk along two sides, which is 20 meters, as opposed to walking directly across the diagonal, which is 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nSo, the difference would be 20 - 10\u221a2 meters, which is approximately 20 - 14.142 = 5.858 meters.\n\nThat seems more reasonable, as walking around the perimeter should be longer than walking diagonally.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of the entire perimeter, which is 40 meters, which would make the difference 40 - 10\u221a2 \u2248 25.86 meters.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because walking around the entire perimeter is a lot more than walking diagonally across.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify what \"walking around the perimeter\" means in this context.\n\nIf you're starting at one corner and wanting to get to the opposite corner, walking around the perimeter would mean walking along two sides, total of 20 meters, while walking diagonally is 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nSo, the difference is 20 - 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if \"walking around the perimeter\" means walking along the entire perimeter, that is, going all the way around the square, which is 40 meters, but that doesn't make sense in comparison to walking diagonally across, because that's a completely different journey.\n\nI think the intended meaning is walking from one corner to the opposite corner via the perimeter, which is 20 meters, versus walking directly across the diagonal, which is 10\u221a2 meters.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 20 - 10\u221a2 meters, or factored, 10(2 - \u221a2) meters.\n\nApproximately, that's 20 - 14.142 = 5.858 meters.\n\nSo, you walk about 5.858 meters farther by taking the perimeter path instead of the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, to express it exactly, it's 10(2 - \u221a2) meters.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal, which I already did, and then subtract the diagonal from the perimeter path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the ratio of the perimeter path to the diagonal, but that's not necessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric ratios, but that would be more complicated for this straightforward problem.\n\nSo, I believe my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference in distance is 20 - 10\u221a2 meters, or approximately 5.858 meters.\n\nBut to present it precisely, I'll use the exact form: 10(2 - \u221a2) meters.\n\nSo, the final answer is 10(2 - \u221a2) meters, or approximately 5.858 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe difference in distance is \\boxed{20 - 10\\sqrt{2} \\text{ meters}} or approximately \\boxed{5.858 \\text{ meters}}."
