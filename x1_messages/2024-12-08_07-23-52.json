        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this man who has some apples. He gives half of them to his friend, then eats three himself, and finally has five left. I need to figure out how many he had at the start.\n\nOkay, let's denote the initial number of apples as X.\n\nFirst, he gives half of his apples to his friend. So, he gives away (1/2)X apples.\n\nAfter giving away half, he has X - (1/2)X = (1/2)X apples left.\n\nThen, he eats three apples himself. So, he subtracts three from what he has left: (1/2)X - 3.\n\nAnd after eating those three, he has five apples left. So, (1/2)X - 3 = 5.\n\nNow, I need to solve for X.\n\nFirst, add 3 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with X:\n\n(1/2)X - 3 + 3 = 5 + 3\n\n(1/2)X = 8\n\nNow, to find X, I need to multiply both sides by 2:\n\n2 * (1/2)X = 8 * 2\n\nX = 16\n\nSo, the man initially had 16 apples.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nStarting with 16 apples, he gives half to his friend, which is 8 apples, so he has 16 - 8 = 8 apples left.\n\nThen, he eats three apples, so 8 - 3 = 5 apples left.\n\nYes, that matches the problem statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
