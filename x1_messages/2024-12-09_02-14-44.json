        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a family of 6 people, and among them, there are two sets of twins. One set is identical and both have brown eyes, and the other set is fraternal with one having blue eyes and the other green eyes. Additionally, we know that at least one person in the family has hazel eyes. We need to find out how many possible combinations of eye colors the remaining two family members can have.\n\nFirst, let's identify who we're dealing with in the family. There are two sets of twins:\n\n1. **Identical twins:** Both have brown eyes.\n\n2. **Fraternal twins:** One has blue eyes, and the other has green eyes.\n\nSo, from these, we already have four family members accounted for:\n\n- Twin A: Brown eyes\n\n- Twin B: Brown eyes\n\n- Fraternal twin C: Blue eyes\n\n- Fraternal twin D: Green eyes\n\nNow, there are two more family members left, let's call them E and F. We know that at least one person in the family has hazel eyes. This means that at least one of these six family members has hazel eyes.\n\nBut wait, among the four already identified, their eye colors are fixed: two brown, one blue, and one green. So, the hazel-eyed person must be either E or F, or possibly both.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that \"at least one person in the family has hazel eyes.\" This person could be any one of the six family members. However, from the information given, the eye colors of the four twins are already specified, and none of them have hazel eyes. Therefore, the hazel-eyed person must be one of the remaining two family members, E or F.\n\nWait, but actually, looking back: the identical twins have brown eyes, and the fraternal twins have one blue and one green. So none of the four specified twins have hazel eyes. Therefore, the hazel-eyed person must be either E or F, or both.\n\nSo, at least one of E or F has hazel eyes.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many possible combinations of eye colors E and F can have, given that at least one of them has hazel eyes.\n\nAssuming that eye colors can be brown, blue, green, or hazel (as these are the colors mentioned so far), but perhaps there are more possible eye colors. However, based on the information given, the eye colors we've encountered are brown, blue, green, and hazel.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider that eye colors can be any of these four: brown, blue, green, hazel.\n\nSo, for each of E and F, there are 4 possible eye colors.\n\nTotal possible combinations without any restrictions would be 4 (for E) * 4 (for F) = 16 combinations.\n\nBut we have the condition that at least one of them has hazel eyes.\n\nSo, we need to subtract the scenarios where neither E nor F has hazel eyes.\n\nIf neither has hazel eyes, then both must have eye colors that are either brown, blue, or green.\n\nSo, for each of E and F, there are 3 choices (brown, blue, green).\n\nThus, the number of combinations where neither has hazel eyes is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the number of combinations where at least one has hazel eyes is total combinations minus the restricted combinations: 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nWait, but let's verify this.\n\nTotal unrestricted combinations: 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nCombinations where neither has hazel eyes: 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, combinations where at least one has hazel eyes: 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nSo, there are 7 possible combinations.\n\nBut let's list them out to be sure:\n\nPossible eye colors for E and F:\n\n1. E: hazel, F: brown\n\n2. E: hazel, F: blue\n\n3. E: hazel, F: green\n\n4. E: hazel, F: hazel\n\n5. E: brown, F: hazel\n\n6. E: blue, F: hazel\n\n7. E: green, F: hazel\n\nWait, that's 7 combinations where at least one has hazel eyes.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n- E has hazel: 4 options for F (brown, blue, green, hazel)\n\n- F has hazel: 4 options for E (brown, blue, green, hazel)\n\n- But this double-counts the case where both have hazel eyes.\n\nSo, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nNumber of combinations where E has hazel or F has hazel:\n\n= (4) + (4) - 1 = 7.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 possible combinations of eye colors for the remaining two family members, given that at least one of them has hazel eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
