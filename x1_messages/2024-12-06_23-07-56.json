        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangle with a length of 12 meters and a width of 6 meters, and I need to find the length of its diagonal. Hmm, I remember something about diagonals in rectangles, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst off, a rectangle has four right angles, and its opposite sides are equal and parallel. The diagonal is the line that connects two opposite corners of the rectangle. I think there's a way to calculate the length of this diagonal using the lengths of the sides.\n\nWait a minute, doesn't the Pythagorean theorem have something to do with this? I seem to recall that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nSo, in this rectangle, if I draw the diagonal, it divides the rectangle into two right-angled triangles. Each of these triangles has the length and width of the rectangle as their legs, and the diagonal as the hypotenuse. That means I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDiagonal\u00b2 = Length\u00b2 + Width\u00b2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiagonal\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + 6\u00b2\n\nCalculating the squares:\n\nDiagonal\u00b2 = 144 + 36\n\nAdding them up:\n\nDiagonal\u00b2 = 180\n\nNow, to find the diagonal, I need to take the square root of 180. Let's see:\n\n\u221a180\n\nI know that 180 can be factored into 36 times 5, and since 36 is a perfect square, I can simplify this:\n\n\u221a180 = \u221a(36 * 5) = \u221a36 * \u221a5 = 6\u221a5\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal is 6\u221a5 meters.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the properties of rectangles or some other geometric principle. Is there anything else I should consider?\n\nI know that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. But I don't think that helps me directly here, since I already have the sides and can use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\nDiagonal\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + 6\u00b2\n\nThat's:\n\nDiagonal\u00b2 = 144 + 36 = 180\n\nThen:\n\nDiagonal = \u221a180 = 6\u221a5 meters\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the coordinates of the rectangle to verify. Let's say one corner is at the origin (0,0), then the adjacent corners would be at (12,0) and (0,6), and the opposite corner at (12,6). The diagonal would be from (0,0) to (12,6), for example.\n\nUsing the distance formula:\n\nDistance = \u221a[(12 - 0)\u00b2 + (6 - 0)\u00b2] = \u221a(144 + 36) = \u221a180 = 6\u221a5 meters\n\nSame result. Good, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using trigonometry? For example, if I know the angles and sides, could I use sine or cosine to find the diagonal?\n\nWell, in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees, so perhaps not necessary. The Pythagorean theorem seems like the most straightforward approach.\n\nLet me consider if the rectangle was not a right-angled rectangle, but something else. Wait, no, this is a rectangle, so it has right angles by definition.\n\nAnother thought: maybe using vectors. If I represent the length and width as vectors, their magnitudes are 12 and 6, and the angle between them is 90 degrees. The diagonal would be the resultant vector.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant vector is \u221a(12\u00b2 + 6\u00b2) = \u221a(144 + 36) = \u221a180 = 6\u221a5 meters.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently from different angles.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. The length and width are in meters, so the diagonal should also be in meters. Everything checks out there.\n\nAlso, does this make sense intuitively? Well, the diagonal should be longer than both the length and the width, which it is, since 6\u221a5 is approximately 13.4 meters, which is greater than both 12 and 6 meters.\n\nLet me verify that approximation:\n\n\u221a5 is approximately 2.236, so 6 * 2.236 = approximately 13.416 meters.\n\nYes, that seems reasonable.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider? Maybe whether the rectangle is a square or not. But in this case, the length and width are different, so it's not a square. But that doesn't affect the application of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The length of the diagonal is indeed 6\u221a5 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6\\sqrt{5} \\text{ meters}} \\]"
