        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1000 units every day, but it only operates for 6 days a week, taking one day off. We need to find out how many units it produces in total over 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days the factory works in one week. Since it operates for 6 days a week, and takes one day off, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, for 4 weeks, the total number of working days would be 6 days/week * 4 weeks.\n\nSo, 6 * 4 equals 24 days.\n\nSince the factory produces 1000 units each day it operates, the total production over 24 days would be 1000 units/day * 24 days.\n\nThat should be 24,000 units.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check.\n\nThe factory operates 6 days a week, takes one day off, and this continues for 4 weeks.\n\nSo, total working days = 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days.\n\nTotal production = 1000 units/day * 24 days = 24,000 units.\n\nHmm, seems straightforward. Maybe I should consider if there are any holidays or additional days off, but the problem doesn't mention any.\n\nAssuming the factory follows this exact schedule without any variations, then 24,000 units should be the correct total production over 4 weeks.\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nTotal units produced in 4 weeks: 24,000 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]"
