        "content": "Let's see. So, the store has a bulk purchase discount policy. If you buy 2 items, you get a 10% discount on each item, and if you buy 3 or more, you get a 20% discount on each item. Each item costs $100, and I need to find out how much it would cost to buy 4 items with the bulk discount.\n\nFirst, since I'm buying 4 items, which is more than 3, I should get the 20% discount on each item. So, for each $100 item, the discount is 20%.\n\nLet me calculate the discount amount per item. 20% of $100 is:\n\n\\( 100 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 100 \\times 0.2 = 20 \\) dollars.\n\nSo, each item costs $100 minus $20 discount, which is $80 per item.\n\nNow, since I'm buying 4 items, the total cost would be:\n\n\\( 4 \\times 80 = 320 \\) dollars.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Is there a cap on the discount or any other condition that might affect the total cost?\n\nLooking back at the problem, it seems straightforward. Buy 4 items, get 20% discount on each, so total cost is 4 times the discounted price.\n\nLet me double-check the discount percentages to make sure I didn't mix them up.\n\n- For 2 items: 10% discount per item.\n\n- For 3 or more items: 20% discount per item.\n\nYes, so 4 items qualify for the 20% discount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to calculate the total cost, like applying the discount to the total amount instead of per item. Let me explore that.\n\nIf I first calculate the total cost without any discount:\n\n\\( 4 \\times 100 = 400 \\) dollars.\n\nThen, applying a 20% discount on the total:\n\n\\( 400 \\times 0.20 = 80 \\) dollars discount.\n\nSo, total cost would be:\n\n\\( 400 - 80 = 320 \\) dollars.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, whether I apply the discount per item or on the total, it comes out to $320 for 4 items.\n\nMaybe there's a reason to prefer one method over the other, but in this case, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nIs there any other aspect to consider here? For example, are there any additional costs like tax or shipping that might be applicable?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any tax or shipping costs, so I can assume that the total cost is just the discounted price of the items.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the discount is applied correctly. Since it's a 20% discount on each item, and not a cumulative discount, I think it's correctly applied by subtracting 20% from each item's price and then summing them up.\n\nAlternatively, in some stores, bulk discounts might work differently, but based on the information provided, this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nLet me consider if there is a possibility of volume-based pricing where buying more items could lead to a higher discount, but the problem states that 3 or more items get a 20% discount, so 4 items should also be at 20%.\n\nI won't overcomplicate this. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is $320.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{320} \\]"
