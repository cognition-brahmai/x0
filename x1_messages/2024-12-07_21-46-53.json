        "content": "I've got this problem here. There are 100 coins on a table, 70 of them are heads up and 30 are tails up. I'm blindfolded, so I can't see which one is which, and I need to create two piles with an equal number of heads up coins. Hmm, this seems tricky at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what I'm dealing with. There are 100 coins: 70 heads up and 30 tails up. I need to make two piles where each pile has the same number of heads up coins. The piles don't have to have the same number of coins in them, just the same number of heads.\n\nSince I'm blindfolded, I can't see which coins are heads or tails, so any coin I pick could be either heads or tails, but I know the overall distribution.\n\nLet's think about it. If I could somehow make sure that whatever number of heads I have in one pile, the other pile has the same number, that would solve the problem. But how?\n\nOne idea is to make two piles with the same number of coins, but that might not guarantee the same number of heads, because the distribution could be different.\n\nWait, but the piles don't have to have the same number of coins, just the same number of heads. So, maybe I can have one pile with fewer coins but more tails, balancing out the heads in the other pile.\n\nHmm, that seems vague. Let's try a different approach.\n\nSuppose I create one pile with a certain number of coins, say n coins, and the other pile will have 100 - n coins. I need the number of heads in both piles to be equal.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- H1: number of heads in pile 1 (with n coins)\n\n- H2: number of heads in pile 2 (with 100 - n coins)\n\nI need H1 = H2.\n\nBut I don't know H1 or H2 because I'm blindfolded.\n\nIs there a way to manipulate the piles so that H1 always equals H2, regardless of the initial distribution?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can flip some coins to ensure that the number of heads in both piles matches.\n\nBut the problem says I cannot determine the state of a coin by feel, so flipping might not help directly.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I pick any number of coins to form pile 1, say n coins, and the remaining 100 - n coins automatically form pile 2.\n\nBut I need H1 = H2.\n\nGiven that the total number of heads is 70, so H1 + H2 = 70.\n\nIf H1 = H2, then each would have 35 heads.\n\nSo, my goal is to make two piles, each with 35 heads.\n\nBut the number of tails in each pile can vary.\n\nThe challenge is that I don't know which coins are heads or tails.\n\nIs there a way to ensure that each pile ends up with 35 heads without knowing the state of the coins?\n\nHere's an idea: what if I create one pile with a specific number of coins, say 30 coins, and then flip all the coins in that pile.\n\nWait, let's think about that.\n\nSuppose I take any 30 coins and set them aside as pile 1, and the remaining 70 coins form pile 2.\n\nIn pile 1, there are H1 heads and T1 tails, where H1 + T1 = 30.\n\nIn pile 2, there are H2 heads and T2 tails, where H2 + T2 = 70.\n\nWe know that H1 + H2 = 70 and T1 + T2 = 30.\n\nOur goal is to have H1 = H2 = 35.\n\nBut since H1 + H2 = 70, if H1 = 35, then H2 = 35 automatically.\n\nSo, how can I make H1 = 35?\n\nSince I can't see the coins, I need to do something that adjusts H1 to 35.\n\nHere's a better plan: take any 30 coins and flip them all to create pile 1, and let pile 2 be the remaining 70 coins.\n\nWait, let's see what happens.\n\nInitially:\n\n- Pile 1: 30 coins, with H1 heads and T1 tails.\n\n- Pile 2: 70 coins, with H2 heads and T2 tails.\n\nWe know H1 + H2 = 70 and T1 + T2 = 30.\n\nAfter flipping all coins in pile 1:\n\n- The heads become tails, and tails become heads.\n\n- So, new H1 = original T1.\n\n- New T1 = original H1.\n\nNow, in pile 1:\n\n- New H1 = original T1.\n\n- New T1 = original H1.\n\nIn pile 2:\n\n- H2 remains the same.\n\n- T2 remains the same.\n\nNow, we need new H1 = H2.\n\nThat is, original T1 = H2.\n\nBut we also know that T1 + T2 = 30 and H2 + T2 = 70 (since H2 + T2 = total coins in pile 2 = 70).\n\nWait, perhaps this isn't leading me directly to the solution.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose I take any 35 coins and make them pile 1, and the remaining 65 coins are pile 2.\n\nLet's say pile 1 has H1 heads and pile 2 has H2 heads.\n\nWe need H1 = H2.\n\nBut H1 + H2 = 70.\n\nSo, H1 = H2 = 35.\n\nBut how do I ensure that H1 = 35?\n\nSince I can't see, maybe I need to introduce a variable that I can control.\n\nHere's a better idea: separate any 35 coins as pile 1 and the remaining 65 as pile 2.\n\nNow, in pile 1, suppose there are H1 heads and 35 - H1 tails.\n\nIn pile 2, there are 70 - H1 heads and 65 - (70 - H1) = H1 - 5 tails.\n\nWait, does that make sense?\n\nWait, total heads are 70.\n\nPile 1 has H1 heads, so pile 2 has 70 - H1 heads.\n\nTails in pile 1: 35 - H1.\n\nTails in pile 2: 65 - (70 - H1) = 65 - 70 + H1 = H1 - 5.\n\nBut tails in pile 2 can't be negative.\n\nWait, if H1 is less than 5, then tails in pile 2 would be negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, maybe this approach is flawed.\n\nLet me try a different strategy.\n\nWhat if I take 35 coins randomly and make them pile 1, and the remaining 65 are pile 2.\n\nThen, I flip all the coins in pile 1.\n\nSo, if pile 1 originally had H1 heads and 35 - H1 tails, after flipping, it will have 35 - H1 heads and H1 tails.\n\nSimilarly, pile 2 remains with 70 - H1 heads and 65 - (70 - H1) = H1 - 5 tails.\n\nNow, in pile 1 (after flipping):\n\n- Heads: 35 - H1\n\n- Tails: H1\n\nIn pile 2:\n\n- Heads: 70 - H1\n\n- Tails: H1 - 5\n\nNow, I need the number of heads in both piles to be equal.\n\nSo, 35 - H1 = 70 - H1\n\nBut that would imply 35 = 70, which is not possible.\n\nSo, this approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the number of coins in pile 1.\n\nSuppose I take 35 coins for pile 1, but instead of flipping all, I flip a certain number.\n\nNo, that might not be feasible without knowing which ones to flip.\n\nAnother idea: take 30 coins (since there are 30 tails) and flip them all, then make them pile 1, and the remaining 70 coins are pile 2.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nInitially:\n\n- Pile 1: 30 coins, with H1 heads and T1 tails.\n\n- Pile 2: 70 coins, with H2 heads and T2 tails.\n\nAfter flipping pile 1:\n\n- New H1 = original T1\n\n- New T1 = original H1\n\nNow, in pile 1: new H1 = T1, new T1 = H1\n\nIn pile 2: H2 heads, T2 tails.\n\nWe need new H1 = H2.\n\nThat is, T1 = H2.\n\nBut we also know that T1 + T2 = 30 (total tails)\n\nAnd H2 + T2 = 70 (total coins in pile 2)\n\nAnd H1 + H2 = 70 (total heads)\n\nWait, but H1 in pile 1 after flipping is T1.\n\nSo, T1 = H2.\n\nFrom T1 + T2 = 30, and H2 + T2 = 70.\n\nSubstitute T1 = H2 into the first equation:\n\nH2 + T2 = 30\n\nBut H2 + T2 = 70 from the second equation.\n\nThis is inconsistent unless H2 + T2 equals both 30 and 70, which is impossible.\n\nSo, this approach doesn't work either.\n\nMaybe I need to select a different number of coins for pile 1.\n\nLet\u2019s try taking 70 coins for pile 1 and flip them all.\n\nThen pile 1 will have:\n\n- New heads: original tails in pile 1\n\n- New tails: original heads in pile 1\n\nPile 2 will have 30 coins with some heads and tails.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Original pile 1: H1 heads, T1 tails (H1 + T1 = 70)\n\n- After flipping: new H1 = T1, new T1 = H1\n\n- Pile 2: H2 heads, T2 tails (H2 + T2 = 30)\n\nWe know that H1 + H2 = 70 and T1 + T2 = 30.\n\nWe need new H1 in pile 1 to equal H2 in pile 2.\n\nSo, T1 = H2.\n\nBut from H1 + H2 = 70 and T1 + T2 = 30.\n\nAlso, H1 + T1 = 70.\n\nSubstituting T1 = H2 into the first equation:\n\nH2 + T2 = 30\n\nAnd H1 + H2 = 70\n\nAnd H1 + T1 = 70\n\nBut T1 = H2, so H1 + H2 = 70\n\nWhich is consistent with H1 + H2 = 70.\n\nSo, this seems possible.\n\nBut I need to ensure that T1 = H2.\n\nGiven that H1 + H2 = 70 and H1 + T1 = 70, then T1 = H2.\n\nSo, after flipping pile 1, new H1 = T1 = H2.\n\nThus, new H1 = H2.\n\nTherefore, by taking 70 coins for pile 1, flipping them all, and leaving the remaining 30 coins as pile 2, I achieve that both piles have the same number of heads.\n\nWait, but let's verify this.\n\nSuppose pile 1 has 70 coins with H1 heads and T1 tails.\n\nAfter flipping, pile 1 has T1 heads and H1 tails.\n\nPile 2 has 30 coins with H2 heads and T2 tails.\n\nWe need T1 (new heads in pile 1) to equal H2 (heads in pile 2).\n\nFrom H1 + H2 = 70 and H1 + T1 = 70, then T1 = H2.\n\nSo, T1 = H2, which is what we need.\n\nTherefore, this method works.\n\nSo, the solution is to separate any 70 coins into pile 1, flip all of them, and let the remaining 30 coins be pile 2.\n\nThen, both piles will have the same number of heads.\n\nThis is a clever solution because it works regardless of the initial distribution of heads and tails in the piles.\n\nLet me try to see with an example to confirm.\n\nSuppose in the 70 coins of pile 1, there are 50 heads and 20 tails.\n\nAfter flipping, pile 1 will have 20 heads and 50 tails.\n\nPile 2 has 30 coins with 20 heads (since total heads are 70, and pile 1 had 50, so pile 2 has 20) and 10 tails.\n\nNow, pile 1 has 20 heads, pile 2 has 20 heads.\n\nPerfect, it works.\n\nAnother example: suppose pile 1 has 60 heads and 10 tails.\n\nAfter flipping, pile 1 has 10 heads and 60 tails.\n\nPile 2 has 10 heads (70 total heads minus 60 in pile 1) and 20 tails.\n\nSo, pile 1 has 10 heads, pile 2 has 10 heads.\n\nAgain, it works.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to separate any 70 coins into pile 1, flip all of them, and let the remaining 30 coins be pile 2.\n\nThis ensures both piles have the same number of heads.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Create a pile of 70 coins, flip all of them, and let the remaining 30 coins form the second pile.}}\n"
