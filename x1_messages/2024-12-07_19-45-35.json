        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The word is \"SUCCESS,\" and we need to find out how many ways we can arrange its letters so that no two S's are next to each other.\n\nFirst, let's see what letters we're dealing with. The word \"SUCCESS\" has 7 letters:\n\n- S, U, C, C, E, S, S\n\nSo, the letters are: S, U, C, C, E, S, S\n\nLet's count how many times each letter appears:\n\n- S appears 3 times\n\n- U appears 1 time\n\n- C appears 2 times\n\n- E appears 1 time\n\nSo, we have a total of 7 letters with some repetitions.\n\nNow, the condition is that no two S's are adjacent. That means we can't have SS in any part of the arrangement.\n\nTo approach this, I think we can first arrange the letters that are not S's, and then find the spots where we can place the S's such that they are not next to each other.\n\nLet's first arrange the non-S letters: U, C, C, E\n\nWait, but there are two C's, so we need to account for that repetition.\n\nThe number of distinct arrangements of these letters is given by the formula for permutations of multiset:\n\nNumber of arrangements = (number of letters)! / (repetition of each letter)!\n\nSo, for U, C, C, E:\n\nNumber of arrangements = 4! / 2! = (24) / 2 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 distinct ways to arrange U, C, C, E.\n\nNow, we need to place the 3 S's into these arrangements, making sure that no two S's are adjacent.\n\nTo do this, let's think about the positions where we can place the S's.\n\nWhen we arrange the 4 non-S letters, there are 5 possible slots where we can place the S's:\n\n- Before the first letter\n\n- Between the first and second letter\n\n- Between the second and third letter\n\n- Between the third and fourth letter\n\n- After the fourth letter\n\nFor example, if we have the arrangement U C C E, the slots are:\n\n_ U _ C _ C _ E _\n\nSo, there are 5 slots (_), and we need to place 3 S's into these slots, with the condition that no two S's are in the same slot or adjacent slots.\n\nWait, but since we're placing S's into these slots, and each slot can hold only one S, because if we put more than one S into a slot, they would be adjacent.\n\nBut actually, since we're placing only one S per slot, and the slots are separated by the other letters, that should ensure that no two S's are adjacent.\n\nSo, we need to choose 3 out of these 5 slots to place the S's.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 slots out of 5 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nSo, for each arrangement of the non-S letters, there are 10 ways to place the S's such that no two S's are adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is:\n\nNumber of arrangements of non-S letters * Number of ways to place S's\n\nWhich is:\n\n12 * 10 = 120\n\nWait, but let's double-check this reasoning to make sure it's correct.\n\nFirst, arranging U, C, C, E in 12 distinct ways.\n\nThen, for each of these arrangements, there are 5 slots to place the S's, and we need to choose 3 of them without placing two S's in the same or adjacent slots.\n\nBy choosing 3 out of 5 slots, we ensure that no two S's are adjacent because the slots are separated by the other letters.\n\nSo, C(5, 3) = 10 ways to place the S's for each arrangement of the other letters.\n\nTherefore, total arrangements = 12 * 10 = 120.\n\nBut, let's consider if there's any overcounting or if we've missed something.\n\nOne thing to consider is that the S's are identical. So, the order in which we place them into the slots doesn't matter; only the positions matter.\n\nSince we're using combinations (C(5, 3)), which don't consider order, that's appropriate for identical S's.\n\nAlso, the non-S letters have repetitions of C, so we correctly accounted for that in the 12 arrangements.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for permutations with restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the problem as arranging the non-S letters first, creating gaps between them to place the S's, ensuring no two S's are adjacent.\n\nThis is similar to placing 3 S's into 5 slots, as we did.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle or other methods, but this slot method seems straightforward and less error-prone for this problem.\n\nSo, I think our initial answer of 120 is correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose we arrange all 7 letters without any restrictions, and then subtract the arrangements where at least two S's are adjacent.\n\nFirst, find the total number of arrangements without restrictions.\n\nTotal arrangements = 7! / (3! * 2!) = 5040 / (6 * 2) = 5040 / 12 = 420\n\nNow, subtract the arrangements where at least two S's are adjacent.\n\nTo find the number of arrangements where at least two S's are adjacent, we can treat two S's as a single entity.\n\nSo, treat two S's as one unit, and then arrange this unit with the other letters.\n\nWe have: SS, S, U, C, C, E\n\nSo, we have 6 entities to arrange: SS, S, U, C, C, E\n\nBut wait, there is still one S separate.\n\nActually, it's better to treat SS as one unit, and then arrange it with the remaining letters, including another S.\n\nSo, total entities: SS, S, U, C, C, E\n\nBut this is getting a bit messy because we have to consider cases where two S's are together or all three are together.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nFirst, find the number of arrangements where at least two S's are adjacent, and subtract that from the total arrangements.\n\nBut, given that our initial approach using slots seems straightforward and less error-prone, I'll stick with that.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid arrangements is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
