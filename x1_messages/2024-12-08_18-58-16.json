        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you need a Python program that checks if a string of parentheses is balanced. That means every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order.\n\nFirst, let's understand what balanced parentheses mean. For example, in the string \"()\", the parentheses are balanced because the opening parenthesis \"(\" is properly closed by the closing parenthesis \")\". Similarly, \"(())\" is balanced, but \"(()\" or \"())\" are not balanced because there's a mismatch in the opening and closing parentheses.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, which is perfect for matching pairs in the correct order.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty stack**: We'll use this to keep track of opening parentheses.\n\n2. **Iterate through each character in the string**:\n   - If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', check if the stack is empty.\n     - If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening parenthesis, so the string is not balanced.\n     - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack.\n\n3. **After processing all characters**:\n   - If the stack is empty, all opening parentheses have been matched with closing ones, so the string is balanced.\n   - If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening parentheses, so the string is not balanced.\n\nLet's write the code based on this logic.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo check if a string of parentheses is balanced, we can use a stack to ensure that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order. Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced Parentheses(s):\n    stack = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')':\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    return len(stack) == 0\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a string of parentheses: \")\nif is_balanced Parentheses(input_string):\n    print(\"The parentheses are balanced.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The parentheses are not balanced.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty stack**: This will store the opening parentheses.\n2. **Iterate through each character in the string**:\n   - If the character is '(', push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is ')', check if the stack is empty:\n     - If the stack is empty, there is no corresponding opening parenthesis, so return `False`.\n     - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack.\n3. **After processing all characters**, check if the stack is empty:\n   - If the stack is empty, all opening parentheses have been matched, so return `True`.\n   - If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening parentheses, so return `False`.\n\nThis method ensures that the parentheses are balanced by maintaining the order and count of opening and closing parentheses using a stack."
