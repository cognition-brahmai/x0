        "content": "Let's see here. There are 10 houses in a row, each with a family that has a different number of members. The first family has one member, the second has two, and so on, up to the tenth family with ten members. Now, one person from each family comes out of their house at the same time. The question is, how many people came out of the houses?\n\nHmm, so there are 10 families, and one person from each family comes out. So, regardless of how many members are in each family, only one person from each family is coming out. That means it's just 1 person per house, and there are 10 houses.\n\nSo, 10 houses times 1 person per house equals 10 people came out.\n\nWait a minute, but the families have different numbers of members, from 1 to 10. But the question says one person from each family comes out. So, it's not about the total number of members in all families, but specifically that only one person from each family is coming out.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 10 people came out of the houses.\n\nBut let me double-check. If there are 10 families and one person from each family comes out, it should indeed be 10 people.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
