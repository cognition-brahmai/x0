        "content": "So I have this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden that measures 30 feet by 40 feet, and there's going to be an additional gate that's 5 feet wide. I need to figure out how many feet of fencing I'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by calculating the perimeter of the garden since it's rectangular. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length is 40 feet and the width is 30 feet. So plugging those values in:\n\nP = 2(40) + 2(30) = 80 + 60 = 140 feet.\n\nThat's the total perimeter without any gates.\n\nNow, there's an additional gate that's 5 feet wide. I'm not sure if this means I need to add 5 feet to the total fencing or if the gate is part of the perimeter, replacing a section of the fence.\n\nLet me think about this. Typically, a gate is installed within the fence, replacing a section of the fence with a movable structure. So, in that case, the total fencing required would still be the same as the perimeter because the gate is just a different component in place of part of the fence.\n\nBut the problem says \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional gate that is 5 feet wide.\" This might imply that besides the fence covering the perimeter, there's an extra gate to be added somewhere.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the gate would be part of the fence, not additional to it. If I have a gate, it's already included in the perimeter fencing.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the gate requires additional fencing on either side to support it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is in addition to the standard fence, meaning there's a fence covering the perimeter and then an extra 5 feet of fencing for the gate.\n\nBut that seems odd because gates are usually part of the fence, not added on top of the fence length.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If the gate is 5 feet wide, that means there's a 5-foot section of the fence that is replaced by the gate. So, the total fencing needed would still be the perimeter length, as the gate is just substituting for that section of the fence.\n\nIn this case, the total fencing required would still be 140 feet, regardless of the gate.\n\nHowever, perhaps the gate itself requires additional fencing to be built around it or alongside it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate is in addition to the perimeter fencing, meaning I need to add the 5 feet to the total perimeter.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because gates are integrated into the fence line.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I have a rectangular garden, and I want to build a fence around it, and include a gate that is 5 feet wide, I would typically install the gate in one of the sides, probably one of the longer sides.\n\nSo, for example, on the 40-foot side, I might have a 5-foot wide gate, and the rest of the fencing would be 35 feet on that side.\n\nTherefore, the total fencing would be:\n\nTwo sides of 30 feet each: 2 * 30 = 60 feet\n\nOne side with 40 feet minus the 5-foot gate: 40 - 5 = 35 feet\n\nAnd the fourth side remains 40 feet.\n\nSo total fencing would be 30 + 30 + 35 + 40 = 135 feet.\n\nWait, but that seems less than the original perimeter of 140 feet. That's because the gate is replacing 5 feet of fencing.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is separate, maybe I need to add the 5 feet to the perimeter.\n\nBut that would make the total fencing 140 + 5 = 145 feet.\n\nI'm getting conflicting results here.\n\nLet me think differently. If the gate is part of the fence, then the total fencing needed is still the perimeter length, 140 feet, and the gate is just a specific section of that fencing.\n\nIn other words, the gate is included in the total perimeter, so no additional fencing is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate requires extra fencing on either side to support it, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate is in addition to the fence, meaning I need to add the gate's length to the perimeter.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because the gate should be incorporated into the fence line, not added separately.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the gate is a separate structure that needs its own fencing.\n\nBut that also seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the gate as a part that needs to be fenced on both sides, meaning I need to account for both sides of the gate in the fencing.\n\nBut that also doesn't make much sense.\n\nLet me look back at the problem statement:\n\n\"A rectangular garden measures 30 feet by 40 feet. If you want to build a fence around the entire garden with an additional gate that is 5 feet wide, how many feet of fencing will you need?\"\n\nThe key phrase here is \"with an additional gate that is 5 feet wide.\" The word \"additional\" suggests that beyond the standard fencing required for the perimeter, there is an extra 5 feet of fencing needed for the gate.\n\nBut in reality, when installing a gate, you don't need extra fencing; the gate replaces a section of the fence.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem is considering that the gate itself requires fencing on both sides, so you need to account for both sides of the gate.\n\nBut that seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate is installed in such a way that it extends beyond the fence line, requiring additional fencing.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the problem statement, I think the safest approach is to assume that the gate is part of the fence and replaces 5 feet of fencing.\n\nTherefore, the total fencing required would be the perimeter minus the width of the gate.\n\nSo, P = 2L + 2W - gate width = 2(40) + 2(30) - 5 = 80 + 60 - 5 = 135 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is considered additional to the perimeter fencing, then total fencing would be P + gate width = 140 + 5 = 145 feet.\n\nBut again, this seems counterintuitive because gates are part of the fence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate requires fencing on both sides, so I need to add the gate width twice.\n\nBut that would make the total fencing P + gate width = 140 + 5 = 145 feet, which is the same as the previous approach.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the gate is a separate piece that needs its own fencing, in addition to the perimeter fencing.\n\nIn that case, total fencing would be P + gate width = 140 + 5 = 145 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is incorporated into the fence, and no additional fencing is needed; hence, total fencing is just P = 140 feet.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Gate is part of the fence, replacing 5 feet of fencing: total fencing = P - gate width = 140 - 5 = 135 feet.\n\n2. Gate is additional to the fence: total fencing = P + gate width = 140 + 5 = 145 feet.\n\nSince the problem says \"with an additional gate,\" it might be implying that the gate is extra, so total fencing would be 145 feet.\n\nBut intuitively, that doesn't align with how gates are typically installed in fences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to say that besides the fence around the garden, there is an additional gate that needs fencing, making it 145 feet.\n\nBut again, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the most straightforward answer is that the gate is part of the fence and replaces 5 feet of fencing, so total fencing needed is 135 feet.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider other possibilities.\n\nPerhaps the gate is installed in such a way that it requires fencing on both sides, meaning I need to account for both sides of the gate.\n\nIn that case, total fencing would be P + gate width = 140 + 5 = 145 feet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate only requires fencing on one side, in which case total fencing would be P + (gate width / 2) = 140 + 2.5 = 142.5 feet.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother consideration: perhaps the gate is hinged on one side and swings out, requiring additional fencing on the hinge side.\n\nBut again, this is speculative.\n\nGiven that, and considering the problem's phrasing, I think the safest bet is to assume that the gate is part of the fence and replaces 5 feet of fencing, resulting in total fencing needed of 135 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is considered additional, then 145 feet.\n\nBut based on standard fence construction, the first scenario is more accurate.\n\nTherefore, I will go with 135 feet of fencing needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{135} \\]"
