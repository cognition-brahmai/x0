The first commercially available microwave oven was called the \"Radarange,\" and it was quite large, about the size of a refrigerator. It's fascinating how technology has evolved, isn't it? Now, microwaves are a standard fixture in kitchens around the world, and they've become much more compact and efficient. I wonder what other inventions from that era have transformed our daily lives in such significant ways."
