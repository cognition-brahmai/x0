        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 150 employees, and they want to form teams for a project. Each team has to have the same number of members, and there should be no more than 10 teams. We need to find out what the possible team sizes could be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a total of 150 employees, and we need to divide them into teams of equal size, with the number of teams being 10 or fewer. So, if we let \\( t \\) represent the number of teams, and \\( s \\) represent the size of each team, then we have:\n\n\\[ t \\times s = 150 \\]\n\nAnd we're given that \\( t \\leq 10 \\).\n\nOur goal is to find all possible values of \\( s \\), given this constraint.\n\nHmm, so I need to find all possible team sizes \\( s \\) such that when 150 is divided by \\( s \\), the result is an integer (since you can't have a fraction of a team), and this number of teams is 10 or fewer.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that \\( s \\) must be a divisor of 150, and the number of teams \\( t = \\frac{150}{s} \\) must be less than or equal to 10.\n\nSo, first, I should probably list all the divisors of 150, and then see which of those divisors, when used as team sizes, result in 10 or fewer teams.\n\nAlright, let's list all the positive divisors of 150. To do that, I can start by finding the prime factorization of 150.\n\n150 divided by 2 is 75, so 2 is a prime factor.\n\n75 divided by 3 is 25, so 3 is a prime factor.\n\n25 is 5 squared, so 5 is a prime factor.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 150 is:\n\n\\[ 150 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\]\n\nNow, to find all the divisors, I can take all possible products of these prime factors.\n\nThe exponents of the primes are:\n\n- 2: exponent 1\n\n- 3: exponent 1\n\n- 5: exponent 2\n\nSo, the number of divisors is (1+1) \\times (1+1) \\times (2+1) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 positive divisors of 150.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. \\( 2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 1 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 2 \\)\n\n3. \\( 2^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^0 = 3 \\)\n\n4. \\( 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^0 = 6 \\)\n\n5. \\( 2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 5 \\)\n\n6. \\( 2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 10 \\)\n\n7. \\( 2^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 15 \\)\n\n8. \\( 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 30 \\)\n\n9. \\( 2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^2 = 25 \\)\n\n10. \\( 2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^2 = 50 \\)\n\n11. \\( 2^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 = 75 \\)\n\n12. \\( 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 = 150 \\)\n\nSo, the divisors of 150 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nNow, these are the possible team sizes \\( s \\), but we have the constraint that the number of teams \\( t = \\frac{150}{s} \\) must be 10 or fewer.\n\nSo, we need to find which of these divisors, when used as \\( s \\), result in \\( t \\leq 10 \\).\n\nLet's calculate \\( t \\) for each possible \\( s \\):\n\n1. If \\( s = 1 \\), then \\( t = 150 \\), which is greater than 10.\n\n2. If \\( s = 2 \\), then \\( t = 75 \\), which is greater than 10.\n\n3. If \\( s = 3 \\), then \\( t = 50 \\), which is greater than 10.\n\n4. If \\( s = 5 \\), then \\( t = 30 \\), which is greater than 10.\n\n5. If \\( s = 6 \\), then \\( t = 25 \\), which is greater than 10.\n\n6. If \\( s = 10 \\), then \\( t = 15 \\), which is greater than 10.\n\n7. If \\( s = 15 \\), then \\( t = 10 \\), which is equal to 10.\n\n8. If \\( s = 25 \\), then \\( t = 6 \\), which is less than 10.\n\n9. If \\( s = 30 \\), then \\( t = 5 \\), which is less than 10.\n\n10. If \\( s = 50 \\), then \\( t = 3 \\), which is less than 10.\n\n11. If \\( s = 75 \\), then \\( t = 2 \\), which is less than 10.\n\n12. If \\( s = 150 \\), then \\( t = 1 \\), which is less than 10.\n\nSo, the team sizes that result in 10 or fewer teams are: 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. The problem says \"no more than 10 teams,\" which means \\( t \\leq 10 \\). So, any team size that results in \\( t \\leq 10 \\) is acceptable.\n\nLooking back at the calculations:\n\n- \\( s = 15 \\) gives \\( t = 10 \\)\n\n- \\( s = 25 \\) gives \\( t = 6 \\)\n\n- \\( s = 30 \\) gives \\( t = 5 \\)\n\n- \\( s = 50 \\) gives \\( t = 3 \\)\n\n- \\( s = 75 \\) gives \\( t = 2 \\)\n\n- \\( s = 150 \\) gives \\( t = 1 \\)\n\nAll of these satisfy \\( t \\leq 10 \\), so these are the possible team sizes.\n\nBut, is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering that the team size must be a divisor of 150 and that the number of teams is 150 divided by the team size, which should be less than or equal to 10.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{150}{s} \\leq 10 \\]\n\nWhich implies:\n\n\\[ s \\geq \\frac{150}{10} \\]\n\n\\[ s \\geq 15 \\]\n\nSo, the team size must be at least 15 to have 10 or fewer teams.\n\nLooking back at the list of divisors, the ones that are 15 or greater are: 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nAnd indeed, these are the team sizes that result in 10 or fewer teams.\n\nSo, the possible team sizes are 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.\n\nBut, let's think about whether there could be any non-divisor team sizes that might work. For example, if we chose a team size that isn't a divisor of 150, would that still work?\n\nWell, the problem states that each team must have the same number of members, which implies that the team size must divide evenly into the total number of employees. Otherwise, we'd have some employees left over or fractions of team members, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, the team size must be a divisor of 150.\n\nSo, the only possible team sizes are the divisors of 150 that result in 10 or fewer teams, which we've already determined to be 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.\n\nWait, but let's consider if team sizes could be smaller than 15, as long as the number of teams doesn't exceed 10.\n\nFor example, if we choose \\( s = 16 \\), which is not a divisor of 150, then \\( t = \\frac{150}{16} = 9.375 \\), which isn't an integer, so that's not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, \\( s = 14 \\) is not a divisor of 150, and \\( t = \\frac{150}{14} \\approx 10.714 \\), which again isn't an integer.\n\nTherefore, only divisors of 150 are valid team sizes.\n\nMoreover, since \\( s \\) must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a person on a team), and \\( t \\) must also be an integer (no fraction of teams), the team size must be a divisor of 150.\n\nHence, the possible team sizes are indeed 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.\n\nBut, let's consider if there's a way to have team sizes that aren't divisors of 150 but still have integer-numbered teams without exceeding 10 teams.\n\nFor instance, suppose we have team sizes of 15, but allow for some teams to have one less member. However, the problem specifies that each team must have the same number of members, so that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the team size must be a divisor of 150.\n\nAdditionally, the number of teams must be 10 or fewer, which translates to team sizes of 15 or greater, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the possible team sizes are 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.\n\nBut, let's think about the practicality of some of these team sizes.\n\nFor example, a team size of 150 would mean only one team, which might not be practical for a project, but since the problem doesn't specify any constraints beyond the number of teams, we have to include it as a possible team size.\n\nSimilarly, a team size of 75 would result in two teams, which is within the limit.\n\nTeam sizes of 50 would give three teams, 30 would give five teams, 25 would give six teams, and 15 would give ten teams.\n\nAll of these options are valid based on the problem's constraints.\n\nTherefore, the possible team sizes are 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.\n\nBut, to present this clearly, perhaps we should list them in ascending order: 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nAlternatively, we could list them in descending order: 150, 75, 50, 30, 25, 15.\n\nIt doesn't matter in terms of correctness, but ascending order might be more intuitive.\n\nSo, the possible team sizes are 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150 employees per team.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's confirm that these team sizes don't exceed 10 teams:\n\n- 150 / 15 = 10 teams\n\n- 150 / 25 = 6 teams\n\n- 150 / 30 = 5 teams\n\n- 150 / 50 = 3 teams\n\n- 150 / 75 = 2 teams\n\n- 150 / 150 = 1 team\n\nAll of these are less than or equal to 10 teams, so they satisfy the condition.\n\nMoreover, any team size larger than 150 wouldn't make sense because you can't have a team larger than the total number of employees.\n\nSimilarly, a team size of 150 is allowed, as it results in one team.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the possible team sizes are 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.\n\nBut, to make sure we haven't missed any possible team sizes that are divisors of 150 and result in 10 or fewer teams, let's list all divisors again and verify:\n\nDivisors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.\n\nFrom these, only team sizes of 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150 result in 10 or fewer teams, as previously determined.\n\nTherefore, the possible team sizes are 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.\n\nSo, the answer is \\( \\boxed{15,\\ 25,\\ 30,\\ 50,\\ 75,\\ 150} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15,\\ 25,\\ 30,\\ 50,\\ 75,\\ 150} \\]\n"
