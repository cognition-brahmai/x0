The expression is:\n\n((7 - 3)^2 * (9 / 3)) / 2\n\nFirst, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with (7 - 3):\n\n7 - 3 = 4\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n(4^2 * (9 / 3)) / 2\n\nNext, I'll calculate 4 squared:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(16 * (9 / 3)) / 2\n\nNext, I'll do the division inside the parentheses:\n\n9 / 3 = 3\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(16 * 3) / 2\n\nNow, multiplication and division are done from left to right, so I'll first multiply 16 by 3:\n\n16 * 3 = 48\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n48 / 2\n\nFinally, divide 48 by 2:\n\n48 / 2 = 24\n\nSo the final answer is 24."
