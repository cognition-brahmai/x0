Every plan should correspond to an evidence value, representing the output of a function when provided with an input string that could be the user's question, earlier evidence values, or both.\n\nThese are the tools you can use:\nYahooSearch[input]: Allows users to look up information using Yahoo's search engine. It's handy for locating websites that might contain answers to the user's question.\nPageLoader[input]: Loads a webpage from an input URL and returns the page's content in plain text.\nURLGatherer[input]: Gathers all URLs found on a webpage. The input is a single URL and the output is a list of URLs found on the page.\nAskBot[input]: A bot that can answer questions based on an input text passage. The input should be a text question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should follow this structure:\nPlan: [First action based on the user's question]\n:evidence0: = [Function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Subsequent function call and input parameter, possibly referring to prior evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: Containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: How did Amazon.com start and who founded it?"
