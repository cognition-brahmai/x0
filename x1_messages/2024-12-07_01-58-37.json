        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 8 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 4 green marbles in a bag, making a total of 18 marbles. I need to find the probability of drawing one red and one blue marble without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw the first marble, I don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second one. So, the total number of marbles decreases after the first draw.\n\nNow, the problem is to draw one red and one blue marble in any order. That means it could be red first and then blue, or blue first and then red.\n\nLet me consider the total number of ways to draw two marbles out of 18. Since the order doesn't matter in this case, I should use combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 marbles out of 18 is C(18, 2).\n\nC(18, 2) = 18! / (2!(18 - 2)!) = (18 \u00d7 17) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 153.\n\nOkay, so there are 153 possible pairs of marbles.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing one red and one blue marble.\n\nThere are 8 red marbles and 6 blue marbles.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red marble is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one blue marble is C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose one red and one blue marble is 8 \u00d7 6 = 48.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nProbability = 48 / 153.\n\nBut I should simplify this fraction.\n\nLet's divide numerator and denominator by 3.\n\n48 \u00f7 3 = 16.\n\n153 \u00f7 3 = 51.\n\nSo, 16/51.\n\nWait, can this be simplified further?\n\n16 and 51 don't have any common factors other than 1, so 16/51 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered the probability step by step, considering the order of drawing.\n\nLet's verify this approach.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red marble first and then a blue marble.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red first is 8/18.\n\nThen, since without replacement, the probability of drawing a blue second is 6/17.\n\nSo, the probability of red then blue is (8/18) \u00d7 (6/17).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing a blue first and then a red marble.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue first is 6/18.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a red second is 8/17.\n\nSo, the probability of blue then red is (6/18) \u00d7 (8/17).\n\nNow, since these are two distinct sequences that both result in one red and one blue marble, I need to add these probabilities together.\n\nSo, total probability = (8/18 \u00d7 6/17) + (6/18 \u00d7 8/17).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\nFirst term: (8/18) \u00d7 (6/17) = (8 \u00d7 6) / (18 \u00d7 17) = 48 / 306.\n\nSecond term: (6/18) \u00d7 (8/17) = (6 \u00d7 8) / (18 \u00d7 17) = 48 / 306.\n\nSo, total probability = 48/306 + 48/306 = 96/306.\n\nSimplify 96/306 by dividing numerator and denominator by 6.\n\n96 \u00f7 6 = 16.\n\n306 \u00f7 6 = 51.\n\nSo, 16/51.\n\nWait, this matches the earlier result of 16/51.\n\nAlright, so both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered the general formula for the probability of drawing two different colored marbles.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only three colors and I'm interested in one specific pair of colors, the previous methods suffice.\n\nJust to explore a bit more, suppose I wanted to consider all possible pairs of different colors.\n\nThere are three possible pairs: red and blue, red and green, blue and green.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks for one red and one blue marble, so I don't need to consider the other pairs.\n\nWait, but to deepen my understanding, maybe I can calculate the probabilities for all pairs and see how they relate.\n\nFirst, red and blue: we've already calculated it as 16/51.\n\nNow, red and green.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red and one green: C(8, 1) \u00d7 C(4, 1) = 8 \u00d7 4 = 32.\n\nSo, probability is 32 / 153.\n\nSimilarly, blue and green: C(6, 1) \u00d7 C(4, 1) = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.\n\nProbability is 24 / 153.\n\nNow, if I add all these probabilities together: (48 + 32 + 24) / 153 = 104 / 153.\n\nThis should be the probability of drawing two marbles of different colors.\n\nAlternatively, the probability of drawing two marbles of the same color is:\n\nEither two red, or two blue, or two green.\n\nTwo red: C(8, 2) = 28.\n\nTwo blue: C(6, 2) = 15.\n\nTwo green: C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nTotal: 28 + 15 + 6 = 49.\n\nSo, probability of drawing two marbles of the same color is 49 / 153.\n\nThen, probability of drawing two marbles of different colors is 1 - (49/153) = 104 / 153.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nGood, it's consistent.\n\nBut back to the original problem, which is just to find the probability of drawing one red and one blue marble.\n\nWe've found it to be 16/51.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider the total number of ways to choose one red and one blue marble, which is 48, and the total number of ways to choose any two marbles, which is 153, giving 48/153, which simplifies to 16/51.\n\nOr, using probabilities step by step, considering the order, we get the same answer.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 16/51 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{16}{51}} \\]"
