        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 21 red balls, 45 blue balls, and 34 green balls. So, total number of balls is 21 + 45 + 34. Let's calculate that: 21 plus 45 is 66, plus 34 is 100. So, there are 100 balls in total.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability that a ball drawn at random is not blue. So, not blue means it could be either red or green, but not blue.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find the probability of drawing a blue ball and then subtract that from 1, because the probability of not getting blue is the same as 1 minus the probability of getting blue.\n\nSo, first, let's find the probability of drawing a blue ball. There are 45 blue balls out of 100 total balls. So, the probability is 45/100. That simplifies to 9/20, but since the question doesn't specify to simplify, maybe we can keep it as 45/100 for now.\n\nThen, the probability of not drawing a blue ball would be 1 - 45/100, which is 55/100. That can be simplified to 11/20.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the number of favorable outcomes, which are the red and green balls combined, and divide that by the total number of balls.\n\nSo, number of red balls is 21, number of green balls is 34. So, 21 + 34 = 55. So, there are 55 balls that are not blue.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a non-blue ball is 55/100, which again simplifies to 11/20.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that probability can also be expressed as a decimal or a percentage. So, 55/100 is 0.55, or 55%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the format, I'll probably just leave it as a fraction, simplified to 11/20.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal balls: 21 red + 45 blue + 34 green = 100 balls. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of non-blue balls: 21 red + 34 green = 55 balls. Correct.\n\nProbability: 55/100 = 11/20. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, 1 - (45/100) = 55/100 = 11/20. Same answer.\n\nSo, I think 11/20 is the correct probability that the ball drawn is not blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{20}} \\]"
