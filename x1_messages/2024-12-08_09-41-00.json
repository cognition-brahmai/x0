        "content": "So, there's this situation where a group of friends has to split a restaurant bill evenly, and the total is $120 with 6 people in the group. The question is, how much does each person need to contribute?\n\nWell, splitting a bill evenly means that each person pays the same amount. So, the total bill needs to be divided by the number of people. In this case, that's $120 divided by 6 people.\n\nLet me do the math here. 120 divided by 6. Okay, 6 times 20 is 120, so each person should pay $20.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If each of the 6 people pays $20, then 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nHowever, I've been in situations where there are taxes or tips to be added to the bill, and sometimes those are split differently. But in this scenario, it just says the total bill is $120, so I'm assuming that's the grand total including everything, and they want to split that total amount evenly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if any of the friends ordered more than others, but again, the instruction is to split it evenly, so regardless of what each person ordered, they're all paying the same amount.\n\nAlso, some groups might choose to round up or down depending on the situation, but since the division comes out evenly to $20 per person, there's no need to round.\n\nI think it's straightforward. Each person contributes $20.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way. Suppose one person pays $20, and you do that 6 times: 20 plus 20 is 40, plus another 20 is 60, plus 20 is 80, plus 20 is 100, plus the last 20 makes 120. Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a calculator, you just enter 120 divided by 6, and it gives you 20.\n\nSo, no matter how you look at it, each person should contribute $20.\n\nI don't see any other factors to consider here. It's a simple division problem, but it's always good to double-check to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
