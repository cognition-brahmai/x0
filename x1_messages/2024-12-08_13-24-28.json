        "content": "So the restaurant serves about 100 customers each day, and each customer leaves behind around 20 grams of food waste. I need to find out how much food waste the restaurant produces in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much food waste is generated per day. Since each of the 100 customers leaves behind 20 grams of food waste, I can multiply the number of customers by the waste per customer to get the daily waste.\n\nSo, daily food waste = number of customers per day \u00d7 waste per customer\n\nThat would be:\n\nDaily food waste = 100 customers/day \u00d7 20 grams/customer\n\nNow, 100 multiplied by 20 is 2,000. So, the restaurant produces 2,000 grams of food waste each day.\n\nNext, I need to find out the weekly waste. Since there are 7 days in a week, I can multiply the daily waste by 7.\n\nWeekly food waste = daily food waste \u00d7 7 days\n\nSo,\n\nWeekly food waste = 2,000 grams/day \u00d7 7 days\n\n2,000 multiplied by 7 is 14,000 grams.\n\nBut, you know, food waste is often measured in kilograms, especially for larger quantities. Since there are 1,000 grams in a kilogram, I can convert grams to kilograms by dividing by 1,000.\n\nSo, weekly food waste in kilograms = 14,000 grams \u00f7 1,000\n\nThat equals 14 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant produces 14 kilograms of food waste in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- 100 customers/day\n\n- 20 grams/customer\n\nDaily waste: 100 \u00d7 20 = 2,000 grams\n\nWeekly waste: 2,000 grams/day \u00d7 7 days = 14,000 grams\n\nConvert to kilograms: 14,000 \u00f7 1,000 = 14 kg\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in kilograms from the beginning. Since 20 grams is 0.02 kilograms (because 20 \u00f7 1,000 = 0.02), then daily waste would be 100 customers \u00d7 0.02 kg/customer = 2 kg/day. Then, 2 kg/day \u00d7 7 days = 14 kg/week. Same answer.\n\nSo, the restaurant produces 14 kilograms of food waste per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14 \\text{ kilograms}} \\]"
