        "content": "So, you've got a rectangular garden that's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, and you want to know two things: first, what's the area of the garden, and second, how many square tiles that are 2 feet on each side you'd need to cover the entire garden. Let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, to find the area of a rectangle, you multiply its length by its width. So, for your garden, that would be 20 feet times 15 feet. Let me do that calculation:\n\n20 feet * 15 feet = 300 square feet.\n\nSo, the area of the garden is 300 square feet.\n\nNow, for the second part, you're looking to cover this garden with square tiles that are 2 feet on each side. Each tile, being a square, has an area of 2 feet * 2 feet, which is 4 square feet.\n\nTo find out how many of these tiles you need to cover the entire garden, you'll divide the total area of the garden by the area of one tile. So that's:\n\n300 square feet / 4 square feet per tile = 75 tiles.\n\nTherefore, you would need 75 tiles to cover the garden completely.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. Since each tile is 2 feet on each side, we can also think in terms of how many tiles fit along the length and the width of the garden.\n\nAlong the length: 20 feet / 2 feet per tile = 10 tiles.\n\nAlong the width: 15 feet / 2 feet per tile = 7.5 tiles.\n\nWait a minute, you can't have half a tile in practice, so this suggests that you might need to cut some tiles to fit the width properly. But since the question is about how many tiles are needed in total, regardless of cutting, the initial calculation of 75 tiles seems correct.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the total number of tiles by multiplying the number of tiles along the length by the number of tiles along the width.\n\n10 tiles (length) * 7.5 tiles (width) = 75 tiles.\n\nYep, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, to summarize: the garden has an area of 300 square feet, and you'll need 75 tiles that are 2 feet on each side to cover it completely.\n\nI hope that helps! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSensAi"
