        "content": "So I've got this problem about a train's journey, and I need to find its overall average speed over the entire six-hour period. Let me break down the information given:\n\n1. The train travels at 60 miles per hour for the first two hours.\n\n2. Then it stops for one hour due to a technical issue.\n\n3. After that, it continues at 80 miles per hour for the next three hours.\n\nSo, the total time of the journey is 2 hours + 1 hour + 3 hours = 6 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total distance traveled and then divide it by the total time to get the average speed.\n\nLet's calculate the distance for each part of the journey:\n\n- For the first part: speed = 60 mph, time = 2 hours. So, distance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 \u00d7 2 = 120 miles.\n\n- During the stop: speed = 0 mph, time = 1 hour. Distance = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 miles.\n\n- For the last part: speed = 80 mph, time = 3 hours. Distance = 80 \u00d7 3 = 240 miles.\n\nNow, the total distance traveled is 120 + 0 + 240 = 360 miles.\n\nThe total time is 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, the overall average speed is total distance divided by total time: 360 miles \u00f7 6 hours = 60 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there's anything I'm missing. Average speed is indeed total distance over total time, but sometimes people get confused and just average the speeds, which would be incorrect.\n\nLet me see: another way to think about it is to consider the weighted average of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, for the first two hours, speed is 60 mph.\n\nFor the next one hour, speed is 0 mph.\n\nFor the last three hours, speed is 80 mph.\n\nTo find the average speed, it's not (60 + 0 + 80) \u00f7 3 = 46.67 mph, because that doesn't account for the different times spent at each speed.\n\nInstead, it's the total distance divided by total time, which I already calculated as 360 miles \u00f7 6 hours = 60 mph.\n\nLet me verify the distance calculations again:\n\n- First part: 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\n- Stop: 0 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 0 miles.\n\n- Last part: 80 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 240 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 120 + 0 + 240 = 360 miles.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 360 \u00f7 6 = 60 mph.\n\nSeems consistent. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
