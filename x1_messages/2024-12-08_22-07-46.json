        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to build a simple chat server using Java sockets. The goal is to allow multiple clients to connect, send messages, and receive messages from other connected clients. I'm going to try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basics of socket programming in Java. Sockets are used for communication between two machines over a network. In this case, I'll have a server socket that listens for incoming connections from clients. Each client will connect to the server via their own socket.\n\nSo, the server should:\n\n1. Create a server socket on a specific port.\n\n2. Listen for incoming client connections.\n\n3. Accept connections and handle each client in a separate thread to manage multiple clients.\n\n4. Receive messages from clients and broadcast them to all other connected clients.\n\nClients should be able to:\n\n1. Connect to the server via a socket.\n\n2. Send messages to the server.\n\n3. Receive messages from the server.\n\nI need to think about how to manage multiple client connections. Each client should have their own thread so that the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- **Server Class:**\n\n- Create a server socket on a specified port.\n\n- Listen for client connections.\n\n- For each client that connects, create a new thread to handle that client's communication.\n\n- Maintain a list of all connected client threads.\n\n- When a message is received from a client, broadcast it to all other clients.\n\n- **Client Class:**\n\n- Connect to the server via a socket.\n\n- Have a way to send messages to the server.\n\n- Receive messages from the server and display them.\n\nI need to decide on the structure of the message. Maybe each message will just be a string containing the user's message.\n\nAlso, I should think about how clients will identify themselves. Maybe each client will send a username when they connect, and that username will be used to prefix their messages.\n\nLet me consider using BufferedReader and PrintWriter for reading and writing messages, as they handle strings easily.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling multiple threads safely, especially when adding/removing clients from the list.\n\n- Ensuring that the server can handle a large number of clients without performance issues.\n\n- Dealing with disconnected clients and removing their threads from the list.\n\nI should use a synchronized list to store client threads to handle concurrent access.\n\nLet me start by outlining the Server class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple chat server using Java sockets that allows multiple clients to connect, send messages, and receive messages from other connected clients, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - Create a server socket on a specific port.\n   - Listen for incoming client connections.\n   - For each client that connects, create a new thread to handle that client's communication.\n   - Maintain a list of all connected client threads.\n   - Broadcast messages received from one client to all other connected clients.\n\n2. **Client Setup:**\n   - Connect to the server via a socket.\n   - Send messages to the server.\n   - Receive messages from the server and display them.\n\n3. **Message Handling:**\n   - Use `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` for reading and writing messages.\n   - Each message is a string that contains the user's message, prefixed by their username.\n\n4. **Thread Management:**\n   - Use separate threads for each client to handle multiple clients simultaneously.\n   - Use a synchronized list to store client threads for safe concurrent access.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n#### Server.java\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Server {\n    private static final int PORT = 1234;\n    private static List<ClientHandler> clients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Server started on port \" + PORT);\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n            ClientHandler client = new ClientHandler(socket);\n            synchronized (clients) {\n                clients.add(client);\n            }\n            new Thread(client).start();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void broadcastMessage(String message, ClientHandler excludeClient) {\n        synchronized (clients) {\n            for (ClientHandler client : clients) {\n                if (client != excludeClient) {\n                    client.sendMessage(message);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n        private Socket socket;\n        private BufferedReader in;\n        private PrintWriter out;\n        private String username;\n\n        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n            this.socket = socket;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            try {\n                in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n                out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n                // Get username from client\n                username = in.readLine();\n                if (username == null || username.isEmpty()) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid username\");\n                    return;\n                }\n\n                // Inform all clients about new user\n                broadcastMessage(username + \" has joined the chat.\", this);\n\n                String message;\n                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(username + \": \" + message);\n                    broadcastMessage(username + \": \" + message, this);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } finally {\n                try {\n                    socket.close();\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n                synchronized (clients) {\n                    clients.remove(this);\n                }\n                // Inform all clients about user leaving\n                broadcastMessage(username + \" has left the chat.\", this);\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void sendMessage(String message) {\n            out.println(message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Client.java\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\n\npublic class Client {\n    private static final String SERVER_ADDRESS = \"localhost\";\n    private static final int PORT = 1234;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Socket socket = new Socket(SERVER_ADDRESS, PORT);\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n        // Get username from user\n        BufferedReader stdIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        System.out.print(\"Enter your username: \");\n        String username = stdIn.readLine();\n        out.println(username);\n\n        // Start a thread to read messages from server\n        new Thread(() -> {\n            try {\n                String response;\n                while ((response = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(response);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }).start();\n\n        // Send messages to server\n        String input;\n        while (true) {\n            input = stdIn.readLine();\n            if (input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"/quit\")) {\n                break;\n            }\n            out.println(input);\n        }\n\n        // Clean up\n        socket.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - The server listens on port 1234.\n   - For each client connection, a new `ClientHandler` thread is created to handle communication.\n   - The server maintains a list of connected clients and broadcasts messages to all connected clients except the sender.\n\n2. **Client Setup:**\n   - The client connects to the server at `localhost` on port 1234.\n   - The client sends the username first and then can send messages.\n   - A separate thread is used to receive messages from the server and print them to the console.\n\n3. **Message Handling:**\n   - Messages are read and written as strings using `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter`.\n   - The server broadcasts messages to all connected clients, prefixing each message with the username.\n\n4. **Thread Management:**\n   - Each client is handled in its own thread to allow multiple clients to connect simultaneously.\n   - The list of clients is synchronized to handle concurrent access safely."
