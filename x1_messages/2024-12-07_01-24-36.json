The pricing structure is as follows: $300 per night for a standard room, $500 per night for a suite, and $1,000 per night for a villa. Calculate the maximum potential revenue for the resort during peak season (90 days), assuming full occupancy and a breakdown of 60% standard rooms, 30% suites, and 10% villas."

        "content": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the maximum potential revenue for a new luxury resort. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 200 rooms in total, divided into three types: standard rooms, suites, and villas. The pricing is $300 per night for a standard room, $500 for a suite, and $1,000 for a villa. The peak season is 90 days, and we're assuming full occupancy. The room distribution is 60% standard rooms, 30% suites, and 10% villas.\n\nOkay, so I need to find out how many of each type of room there are. Let's calculate that.\n\nTotal rooms = 200\n\nStandard rooms = 60% of 200 = 0.60 * 200 = 120 rooms\n\nSuites = 30% of 200 = 0.30 * 200 = 60 rooms\n\nVillas = 10% of 200 = 0.10 * 200 = 20 rooms\n\nNow, we need to calculate the revenue per night for each type of room and then sum them up for the total nightly revenue.\n\nRevenue from standard rooms per night = 120 rooms * $300/room = $36,000\n\nRevenue from suites per night = 60 rooms * $500/room = $30,000\n\nRevenue from villas per night = 20 rooms * $1,000/room = $20,000\n\nTotal revenue per night = $36,000 + $30,000 + $20,000 = $86,000\n\nNow, since the peak season is 90 days, and assuming full occupancy every night, the maximum potential revenue would be:\n\nTotal revenue = $86,000/night * 90 nights = $7,740,000\n\nSo, the maximum potential revenue for the resort during the peak season is $7,740,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, room distribution:\n\n60% of 200 is indeed 120 standard rooms.\n\n30% of 200 is 60 suites.\n\n10% of 200 is 20 villas.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, revenue per night:\n\n120 rooms * $300 = $36,000\n\n60 rooms * $500 = $30,000\n\n20 rooms * $1,000 = $20,000\n\nTotaling $86,000 per night.\n\nOver 90 days, that would be $86,000 * 90 = $7,740,000.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Is there anything else I need to consider? Are there any hidden costs or variables that might affect the revenue? The problem says to assume full occupancy, so I don't need to factor in any vacancies.\n\nAlso, it's a luxury resort, so maybe there are additional services or amenities that could generate extra revenue, but the question only asks about room revenues based on the given prices.\n\nSo, I think $7,740,000 is the correct maximum potential revenue for the peak season.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7740000} \\]"
