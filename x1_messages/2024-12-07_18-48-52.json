        "content": "Let's see here. So, three friends went out for dinner and the total bill was $90. They decided to split it evenly, which means each should pay $30, right? Because 90 divided by 3 is 30.\n\nNow, one friend only had a $50 bill, so he paid $50. The other two friends each gave him $10 to make up for the extra amount he paid. So, let's see what that means.\n\nIf each of the other two friends gave him $10, that's a total of $20 from them. Added to the $50 he already paid, that makes $70 in total. But the bill was $90, so there's still $20 missing.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to think differently.\n\nMaybe the friend with the $50 bill paid $50 towards the bill, and the other two friends each gave him $10, making his total contribution $50 + $10 + $10 = $70. But the bill was $90, so there's still $20 needed. Did they get that from somewhere else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friend who paid $50 is being reimbursed by the others. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, the total bill is $90, and they are splitting it evenly, so each should pay $30.\n\nOne friend paid $50, which is $20 more than his share of $30.\n\nThe other two friends each gave him $10, so together they gave him $20.\n\nThis $20 covers the extra $20 that he paid above his share.\n\nSo now, the friend who paid $50 has been reimbursed the $20, meaning his net payment is $30, which is correct.\n\nThe other two friends each gave $10, which should be considered as their payment towards the bill.\n\nSo, each of the other two friends has paid $10, but their share was $30 each. So, they still owe $20 each.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the other two friends each gave him $10 to make up for the extra amount he paid. So, perhaps they think that by giving him $10 each, their debt is settled.\n\nBut mathematically, that doesn't add up because each of them still owes $20.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nMaybe the friend who paid $50 is covering the entire bill, and the others are giving him $10 each as their contribution.\n\nSo, he paid $50, and received $10 from each of the other two, totaling $20.\n\nSo, his net payment is $50 - $20 = $30, which is correct.\n\nThe other two each paid $10, but their share was $30, so they still owe $20 each.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion in the way the problem is stated.\n\nIt says, \"One friend only had a $50 bill, so he paid with that. The other two friends each gave him $10 to make up for the extra amount he paid.\"\n\nIt seems like the other two friends are giving him $10 each as their contribution towards the bill.\n\nSo, the friend who paid $50 gets $10 from each of the other two, totaling $20.\n\nTherefore, his net payment is $50 - $20 = $30.\n\nEach of the other two friends has paid $10 so far.\n\nSince each friend should pay $30, the other two friends still need to pay $20 each.\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that they think this arrangement makes it even.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me try to rephrase it.\n\nTotal bill: $90\n\nEach should pay: $30\n\nOne friend pays $50.\n\nOther two each give him $10, totaling $20.\n\nSo, the friend who paid $50 now has $50 - $20 = $30.\n\nEach of the other two has paid $10, but they should have paid $30, so they still owe $20 each.\n\nTherefore, to make it even, each of the other two friends should pay an additional $20.\n\nBut the problem says \"each gave him $10 to make up for the extra amount he paid.\"\n\nIt seems like they think that by giving him $10 each, they have settled their debt.\n\nBut mathematically, that's not correct because they still owe $20 each.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in their calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend who paid $50 is covering the entire bill of $90, and the other two are each giving him $10 as partial payment.\n\nIn that case, he would still need $70 from them to cover the bill.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose friend A paid $50.\n\nFriends B and C each gave A $10.\n\nSo, A has paid $50 and received $10 from B and $10 from C, so A's net payment is $50 - $20 = $30.\n\nEach of B and C has paid $10 so far.\n\nSince each should pay $30, B and C each still owe $20.\n\nTherefore, to make it even, B and C each need to pay an additional $20.\n\nBut perhaps the friends think that by giving A $10 each, they have settled their debt, which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friends are trying to settle the bill in a different way.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the total money flow.\n\nTotal bill: $90\n\nA paid $50.\n\nB and C each gave A $10, so A has $50 - $20 = $30.\n\nB paid $10, should pay $30, so owes $20 more.\n\nC paid $10, should pay $30, so owes $20 more.\n\nTherefore, to make it even, B and C each need to pay $20 more.\n\nBut perhaps the friends think that since A paid $50 and they each gave him $10, making it $70, and the bill was $90, there's still $20 missing.\n\nBut if B and C each pay an additional $10, that would cover the remaining $20.\n\nWait, but that would make A's total payment $50 - $20 (from B and C) + $20 (from B and C again) = $50.\n\nBut they should each pay $30.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to simplify.\n\nEach friend should pay $30.\n\nA paid $50 initially.\n\nB and C each gave A $10, so A's net payment is $50 - $20 = $30.\n\nB has paid $10, so needs to pay $20 more.\n\nC has paid $10, so needs to pay $20 more.\n\nTherefore, to make it even, B and C each need to pay $20 more.\n\nBut perhaps the friends think that since A paid $50 and they each gave him $10, making it $70, and the bill was $90, there's still $20 missing.\n\nSo, if B and C each pay an additional $10, that would make their total payment $20 each, which is correct.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf B and C each pay an additional $10, their total payment would be $10 + $10 = $20 each, which is correct.\n\nAnd A paid $50 - $20 (from B and C) = $30.\n\nTotal payments: A $30, B $20, C $20.\n\nTotal: $30 + $20 + $20 = $70, but the bill was $90.\n\nSo, they would still owe $20 more.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI must be miscalculating something.\n\nLet me start over.\n\nTotal bill: $90\n\nEach should pay: $30\n\nA paid $50.\n\nB and C each gave A $10, so A's net payment is $50 - $20 = $30.\n\nB has paid $10, so needs to pay $20 more.\n\nC has paid $10, so needs to pay $20 more.\n\nTherefore, B and C each need to pay $20 more to cover their share.\n\nBut if they each pay $20 more, that's $40 additional.\n\nAdded to the $50 A paid and the $20 from B and C, total would be $50 + $40 = $90.\n\nWait, but A already paid $50 and received $20 from B and C, so his net payment is $30.\n\nB and C each pay $20 more, making their total payment $20 each.\n\nTotal payments: A $30, B $20, C $20, which sums to $70, not $90.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nI must be missing something.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the friend who paid $50 is covering the entire bill of $90, and the other two friends are giving him $10 each as partial repayment.\n\nIn that case, he would still need $70 from them to cover the bill.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says the other two friends each gave him $10 to make up for the extra amount he paid.\n\nIt seems like they are trying to adjust their payments to make it even.\n\nBut according to my calculations, each of the other two friends still owes $20.\n\nTherefore, to make it even, each should pay an additional $20.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nMaybe the friend who paid $50 is covering the entire bill, and the other two friends are giving him $10 each as their contribution, and they think that settles their debt.\n\nBut mathematically, that's incorrect because they should be giving him $30 each to cover their share.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf A paid $50 for a $90 bill, and B and C each gave him $10, making it $70, then they still need to pay $20 more to cover the bill.\n\nBut each friend should pay $30.\n\nSo, A has paid $30 net, B has paid $10, and C has paid $10.\n\nTherefore, B and C each need to pay an additional $20 to reach their $30 share.\n\nAlternatively, if B and C each pay an additional $10, making their total payment $20 each, and A paid $30, the total is $70, which is $20 short of the $90 bill.\n\nTherefore, B and C need to pay an additional $10 each, totaling $30 each, to cover the remaining $20.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up.\n\nIf B and C each pay an additional $10, their total payment would be $20 each, and A paid $30, totaling $70.\n\nThey still need to pay $20 more to cover the $90 bill.\n\nSo, either B and C each pay an additional $10, or one pays $20 and the other pays $0, or any combination that adds up to $20.\n\nBut to make it even, each should pay an equal amount.\n\nTherefore, each should pay an additional $10.\n\nSo, in total, each friend should pay $30.\n\nA has already paid $30 net, and B and C have each paid $10 and need to pay an additional $20.\n\nBut to make it even, perhaps they should each pay $30 in total.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, one friend paid $50 and the other two each gave him $10.\n\nSo, to make it even, each should pay $30.\n\nTherefore, B and C should each pay an additional $20.\n\nBut according to the problem, they think that by giving him $10 each, they have settled their debt.\n\nTherefore, there is a misunderstanding in their calculation.\n\nIn reality, to make it even, each should pay $30.\n\nA paid $50 and was given $10 by B and $10 by C, so his net payment is $30.\n\nB paid $10, so he needs to pay $20 more.\n\nC paid $10, so he needs to pay $20 more.\n\nTherefore, B and C each should pay an additional $20.\n\nBut perhaps the friends think that by giving A $10 each, they have covered their share, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, to answer the question, each friend should actually pay $30.\n\nA has already reached his $30, while B and C have only paid $10 each and need to pay an additional $20 each.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
