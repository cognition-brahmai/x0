How about this: Why was the meeting so successful?\n\nBecause it had a great agenda \u2013 it was set on \"accomplish\" mode!\n\nHmm, maybe not funny enough. Let me think of another one.\n\nWhy did the office plants get promoted?\n\nThey always bloom where they're planted!\n\nOkay, maybe that's a stretch. Here's another attempt:\n\nWhy do computers never get lost in the office?\n\nBecause they always know their desktop!\n\nAlright, perhaps not side-splitting laughter, but it's something.\n\nWait, here's a better one: Why did the employee bring a ladder to work?\n\nBecause he wanted to take his career to new heights!\n\nI think that one works. It's a bit cheesy, but it should make people smile.\n\nAlternatively: Why was the computer cold in the office?\n\nBecause it left its Windows open!\n\nOh man, I'm really reaching here. Let's see.\n\nWhy did the pencil go to the office?\n\nTo get a promotion \u2013 from a number two to a number one!\n\nI hope one of these makes you chuckle!\n\n**Final Joke:**\n\nWhy did the employee bring a ladder to work?\n\nBecause he wanted to take his career to new heights!"
