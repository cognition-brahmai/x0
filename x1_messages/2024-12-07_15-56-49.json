        "content": "So I have this problem here about finding the volume of a cylindrical container. The container has a diameter of 8 inches and a height of 12 inches. I need to find out what its volume is in cubic inches.\n\nFirst, I recall that the formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. So, I need to find the radius from the given diameter.\n\nThe diameter is 8 inches, and I know that the radius is half of the diameter, so r = d/2. Therefore, r = 8/2 = 4 inches.\n\nNow, I can plug the values into the formula: V = \u03c0*(4)\u00b2*12.\n\nCalculating the square of the radius: 4\u00b2 = 16.\n\nThen, multiplying by the height: 16*12 = 192.\n\nFinally, multiplying by \u03c0: V = 192\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nBut I might need a numerical value, so I can approximate \u03c0 as 3.14.\n\nTherefore, V \u2248 192*3.14 = 602.88 cubic inches.\n\nSo, the volume of the container is approximately 602.88 cubic inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192\\pi} \\] or approximately \\[ \\boxed{602.88} \\] cubic inches"
