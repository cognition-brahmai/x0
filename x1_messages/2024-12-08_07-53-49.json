        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To create a simple web server in Go that listens on a specific port and responds with the current date and time in JSON format when you access the \"/time\" endpoint, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Go environment**: Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Create a new Go file**: Let's name it `main.go`.\n\n3. **Write the code for the web server**:\n\n   - Import the necessary packages: `net/http` for handling HTTP requests and `time` for getting the current date and time.\n\n   - Define a handler function for the \"/time\" endpoint that creates a JSON response with the current date and time.\n\n   - Set up the server to listen on a specific port and handle requests.\n\nHere's a sample code that accomplishes this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\ntype TimeResponse struct {\n\tTime string `json:\"time\"`\n}\n\nfunc timeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tcurrentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339)\n\tresponse := TimeResponse{Time: currentTime}\n\tjsonResponse, err := json.Marshal(response)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tw.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n\tw.Write(jsonResponse)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/time\", timeHandler)\n\tport := \"8080\" // You can change this to any port you prefer\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Server is running on port %s\\n\", port)\n\thttp.ListenAndServe(\":\"+port, nil)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **TimeResponse struct**: This defines the structure of the JSON response, which includes a single field \"time\" containing the current date and time.\n\n- **timeHandler function**: This function is called when there's a request to the \"/time\" endpoint. It gets the current time, formats it as a string, creates a JSON response, and sends it back to the client.\n\n- **main function**: Sets up the HTTP handler for the \"/time\" endpoint and starts the server to listen on the specified port (in this case, port 8080).\n\n### Running the Server:\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `main.go`.\n\n2. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n\n3. Navigate to the directory containing `main.go`.\n\n4. Run the following command to start the server:\n\n   ```sh\n   go run main.go\n   ```\n\n5. Once the server is running, you can access it by going to `http://localhost:8080/time` in your web browser or using a tool like curl:\n\n   ```sh\n   curl http://localhost:8080/time\n   ```\n\nYou should see a JSON response similar to:\n\n```json\n{\"time\":\"2023-04-01T12:34:56Z\"}\n```\n\nThis indicates that the server is working correctly and returning the current date and time in JSON format.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
