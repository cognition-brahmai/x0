        "content": "So I've got this problem: I have 5 different fruits, and I need to figure out how many ways I can arrange them in a row on a shelf. Hmm, arrangement sounds like permutations to me because the order matters here. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that permutations are used when the order of items is important. So, if I have 5 distinct fruits, say an apple, a banana, a cherry, a date, and an elderberry, each different arrangement would be unique and count as a separate way.\n\nLet me recall the formula for permutations. The number of permutations of n distinct objects is n factorial, denoted as n!. So, for 5 fruits, it should be 5!.\n\nWait, what's 5! again? I think 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120. So, there are 120 different ways to arrange these 5 fruits in a row.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe I can think about it differently to confirm.\n\nStarting from the left end of the shelf, I have 5 choices for which fruit to place first since all are different. Once I've chosen the first fruit, there are 4 fruits left for the second position. Then, 3 choices for the third position, 2 for the fourth, and finally, only 1 fruit left for the last position.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements would be 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which again is 120.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using permutations formula where we select all items.\n\nYes, the formula for permutations when selecting r items from n distinct items is nPr = n! / (n - r)!. In this case, since I'm arranging all 5 fruits, r = n = 5. So, 5P5 = 5! / (5 - 5)! = 5! / 0!.\n\nI know that 0! is defined as 1. So, 5! / 1 = 5! = 120.\n\nAlright, multiple ways of thinking about it all lead to 120. I think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where arrangements might be the same, like if some fruits were identical. But the problem says 5 different fruits, so all are unique.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies arranging them in a row on a shelf, so the order matters, which confirms that permutations are the way to go.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here. The answer should be 120 different ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
