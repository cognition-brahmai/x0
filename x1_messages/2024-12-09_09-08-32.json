Let's break down the task into smaller steps to make it easier to understand and implement.\n\nFirst, we need to create an Employee class with properties for ID, name, age, and department. Each property should have getter and setter methods.\n\nNext, we need to read data from a CSV file and store it in an ArrayList of Employee objects. To handle CSV files in Java, we can use the BufferedReader class to read the file line by line and split each line into its components based on commas.\n\nAfter that, we need to implement methods to sort the list of employees based on different criteria: employee ID, name, age, or department. For sorting, we can use the Collections.sort() method along with a Comparator that defines the sorting order based on the desired property.\n\nLet's start by defining the Employee class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Java program that reads employee data from a CSV file and stores it in an `ArrayList` of `Employee` objects. We also need to implement methods to sort this list based on different criteria: employee ID, name, age, or department.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Employee Class**: Define an `Employee` class with properties for ID, name, age, and department, along with getter and setter methods.\n2. **Reading CSV File**: Use `BufferedReader` to read the CSV file line by line and parse each line to create `Employee` objects, which are then stored in an `ArrayList`.\n3. **Sorting Methods**: Implement methods to sort the list of employees based on ID, name, age, or department using `Collections.sort()` with appropriate `Comparator`s.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass Employee {\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private String department;\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, int age, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public int getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public String getDepartment() {\n        return department;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee [ID=\" + id + \", Name=\" + name + \", Age=\" + age + \", Department=\" + department + \"]\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class EmployeeSorter {\n\n    public static List<Employee> readEmployeesFromFile(String fileName) {\n        List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                String[] values = line.split(\",\");\n                if (values.length == 4) {\n                    int id = Integer.parseInt(values[0]);\n                    String name = values[1];\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(values[2]);\n                    String department = values[3];\n                    employees.add(new Employee(id, name, age, department));\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        return employees;\n    }\n\n    public static void sortById(List<Employee> employees) {\n        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getId));\n    }\n\n    public static void sortByName(List<Employee> employees) {\n        employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName));\n    }\n\n    public static void sortByAge(List<Employee> employees) {\n        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getAge));\n    }\n\n    public static void sortByDepartment(List<Employee> employees) {\n        employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getDepartment));\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Employee> employees = readEmployeesFromFile(\"employees.csv\");\n        System.out.println(\"Original list:\");\n        employees.forEach(System.out::println);\n\n        sortById(employees);\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by ID:\");\n        employees.forEach(System.out::println);\n\n        sortByName(employees);\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Name:\");\n        employees.forEach(System.out::println);\n\n        sortByAge(employees);\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Age:\");\n        employees.forEach(System.out::println);\n\n        sortByDepartment(employees);\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Department:\");\n        employees.forEach(System.out::println);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Employee Class**: This class has private fields for ID, name, age, and department with public getters and setters. It also includes a constructor to initialize these fields and a `toString` method for easy printing.\n\n2. **Reading CSV File**: The `readEmployeesFromFile` method reads the CSV file specified by `fileName`. It uses `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line, splits each line by commas, and creates `Employee` objects which are added to an `ArrayList`.\n\n3. **Sorting Methods**: There are four sorting methods:\n   - `sortById`: Sorts the list of employees by their ID.\n   - `sortByName`: Sorts the list by employees' names.\n   - `sortByAge`: Sorts the list by employees' ages.\n   - `sortByDepartment`: Sorts the list by employees' departments.\n\n   Each method uses `Collections.sort()` with a `Comparator` that specifies the sorting order based on the desired property.\n\n4. **Main Method**: This method demonstrates reading the employee data from a CSV file and sorting the list in different ways, printing the list before and after each sort for verification."
