        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 4 people who speak English, 3 who speak French, and 2 who speak both English and French. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected person speaks only English.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many people are in the room. I can't just add 4 + 3 because that would count the people who speak both languages twice. So, I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe total number of people is the number who speak English plus the number who speak French minus the number who speak both. So, that's 4 + 3 - 2 = 5 people in the room.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many people speak only English. Since 2 people speak both English and French, the number of people who speak only English is the total English speakers minus those who speak both. So, 4 - 2 = 2 people speak only English.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected person speaks only English is the number of people who speak only English divided by the total number of people in the room. That is 2/5, which is 0.4 or 40%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should visualize this with a Venn diagram.\n\nOkay, imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents English speakers, the other represents French speakers.\n\n- The English circle has 4 people.\n\n- The French circle has 3 people.\n\n- The overlap, where both English and French are spoken, has 2 people.\n\nSo, the part of the English circle that doesn't overlap with French represents people who speak only English. That's 4 (total English speakers) minus 2 (who speak both), which is again 2 people.\n\nThe total number of people is the sum of those who speak only English, only French, and both. That's:\n\n- Only English: 2 people\n\n- Only French: 3 - 2 = 1 person\n\n- Both: 2 people\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 people.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting someone who speaks only English is 2 out of 5, which is indeed 0.4 or 40%.\n\nI think that makes sense. Alternatively, I could use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nHere, the favorable outcomes are people who speak only English, which is 2, and the total possible outcomes are the total number of people, which is 5.\n\nSo, Probability = 2/5 = 0.4 or 40%.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can approach this another way. Let's consider the probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability that a person speaks English is 4/5.\n\nThe probability that a person speaks French is 3/5.\n\nThe probability that a person speaks both English and French is 2/5.\n\nNow, the probability that a person speaks only English would be the probability that they speak English minus the probability that they speak both English and French.\n\nSo, P(only English) = P(English) - P(both English and French) = 4/5 - 2/5 = 2/5, which again is 0.4 or 40%.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the inclusion-exclusion principle for probabilities:\n\nP(English or French) = P(English) + P(French) - P(both English and French)\n\nBut in this problem, I'm not directly asked for P(English or French). I'm asked for P(only English).\n\nWait, but actually, P(only English) is P(English) - P(both English and French), which is what I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of people and the different language groups.\n\nTotal people = 5, as calculated before.\n\nOnly English: 2\n\nOnly French: 1\n\nBoth: 2\n\nSo, again, only English is 2 out of 5.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and I keep getting the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure the probability is 2/5 or 40%.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that someone doesn't speak either English or French? The problem doesn't mention that, so I'm assuming that everyone in the room speaks at least English or French. If there were people who didn't speak either, that would change the total number of people, but based on the problem statement, it seems like everyone speaks at least one of the two languages.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"randomly selected,\" so I'm assuming that each person has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether speaking both languages affects the probability in any other way, but I don't think so. The problem is straightforward in that regard.\n\nSo, I think 2/5 is the correct probability that a randomly selected person speaks only English.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Total English speakers: 4\n\n- Total French speakers: 3\n\n- Both English and French speakers: 2\n\n- Only English speakers: 4 - 2 = 2\n\n- Total people: 4 + 3 - 2 = 5\n\n- Probability of selecting only English speaker: 2/5 = 0.4 or 40%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.4} \\]"
