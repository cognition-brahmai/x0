        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a jar with 4 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. I need to find the probability of not drawing a red marble when I pick one at random. Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need the probability of not drawing a red marble. That means I want to draw either a blue or a green marble, but not a red one.\n\nI remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing a blue or a green marble, and the total outcomes are all the marbles in the jar.\n\nLet me first find the total number of marbles. There are 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green marbles. So, total marbles = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 marbles.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of blue and green marbles combined, since I don't want a red one. So, favorable outcomes = 3 blue + 2 green = 5 marbles.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not drawing a red marble is 5 (favorable) divided by 9 (total), which is 5/9.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? I know that the probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event happening. So, the probability of not drawing a red marble is equal to 1 minus the probability of drawing a red marble.\n\nLet me check if I get the same answer this way. The probability of drawing a red marble is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 4/9.\n\nSo, 1 - 4/9 = 5/9.\n\nYep, same answer. That's a good sanity check.\n\nI guess both methods make sense, and it's helpful to see that they give the same result. It reinforces that 5/9 is the correct probability.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider here? The problem seems straightforward, and I don't think there are any tricky aspects to it. The marbles are picked randomly, so each marble has an equal chance of being selected, which is what I've assumed in my calculations.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the marbles were not equally likely to be picked, but that's not the case here. The problem states \"picking one out randomly,\" which typically means each marble has an equal probability.\n\nAlso, since we're only drawing one marble, I don't have to worry about replacement or multiple draws.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of not drawing a red marble is 5/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{9}} \\]"
