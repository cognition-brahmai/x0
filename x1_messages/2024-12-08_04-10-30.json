        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are three children: the oldest, the middle, and the youngest. The oldest is twice as old as the youngest, and the middle is half the age of the oldest. Altogether, their ages add up to 36 years. I need to find out how old each one is.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to each child's age to make it easier to work with. Let's say:\n\n- Let Y be the age of the youngest child.\n\n- Then, the oldest child is twice as old as the youngest, so O = 2Y.\n\n- The middle child is half the age of the oldest, so M = O / 2.\n\nBut since O is 2Y, M = (2Y) / 2, which simplifies to M = Y.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. So, the middle child is also Y years old? That means the middle and youngest children are the same age?\n\nHmm, that can't be right. Let me double-check the relationships.\n\nThe oldest is twice as old as the youngest: O = 2Y.\n\nThe middle is half the age of the oldest: M = O / 2.\n\nSubstituting O from the first equation into the second: M = (2Y)/2 = Y.\n\nSo, M = Y.\n\nBut in most families, the middle child is older than the youngest. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the relationships.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"The oldest child is twice as old as the youngest child. The middle child is half the age of the oldest child. If the total age of all three children is 36 years, how old is each child?\"\n\nOkay, so oldest is twice youngest, and middle is half of the oldest. So, if oldest is O, youngest is Y, and middle is M.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. O = 2Y\n\n2. M = O / 2\n\n3. O + M + Y = 36\n\nFrom equation 1: O = 2Y\n\nFrom equation 2: M = O / 2 = (2Y)/2 = Y\n\nSo, M = Y\n\nThen, plugging into equation 3:\n\n2Y (oldest) + Y (middle) + Y (youngest) = 36\n\nThat is: 2Y + Y + Y = 36\n\nSo, 4Y = 36\n\nTherefore, Y = 36 / 4 = 9 years old.\n\nThen, M = Y = 9 years old.\n\nO = 2Y = 18 years old.\n\nWait, so the middle and youngest are both 9 years old? That seems odd. Maybe the problem is phrased differently.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle child is half the age of the oldest, but not necessarily younger than the oldest. But that would be strange.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the middle child is between the oldest and the youngest in age, but according to the equations, M = Y.\n\nThis suggests that maybe the problem has no solution, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ages are not whole numbers.\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again.\n\nGiven:\n\nO = 2Y\n\nM = O / 2 = Y\n\nThen, O + M + Y = 2Y + Y + Y = 4Y = 36\n\nSo, Y = 9\n\nThen, M = 9\n\nO = 18\n\nBut it seems odd that middle and youngest are the same age. Maybe the problem expects this outcome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I'm interpreting it wrong.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"The oldest child is twice as old as the youngest child. The middle child is half the age of the oldest child. If the total age of all three children is 36 years, how old is each child?\"\n\nSo, oldest is twice youngest: O = 2Y\n\nMiddle is half of oldest: M = O / 2 = Y\n\nTotal age: O + M + Y = 2Y + Y + Y = 4Y = 36 \u2192 Y = 9\n\nSo, youngest is 9, middle is 9, oldest is 18.\n\nMaybe in this family, the middle and youngest children are twins.\n\nThat could be a possible scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has an error, or perhaps it's intentionally leading to this conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the middle child is younger than the oldest but older than the youngest, which would contradict M = Y, but according to the equations, M = Y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the middle child is half the age of the oldest, but also older than the youngest.\n\nWait, according to O = 2Y and M = O / 2 = Y, and Y < M < O, which would be Y < Y < O, which is only possible if Y = M, but that seems to violate the notion of \"middle\" child.\n\nUnless Y = M, and then they are twins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle child is half the age of the oldest, but not necessarily directly related to the youngest.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, M = Y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different way to interpret \"the middle child is half the age of the oldest child.\"\n\nMaybe it's meant to be that the middle child is half the age of the oldest child at different points in time, but that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the oldest is twice the youngest, and the middle is half the age of the oldest, but that leads to M = Y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different relationship I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved with different assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is impossible, as it leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the equations, Y = 9, M = 9, O = 18, and their ages sum to 36, which matches the problem.\n\nSo, perhaps this is the solution: youngest is 9, middle is 9, oldest is 18.\n\nMaybe the middle and youngest are twins.\n\nThat seems to be the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Youngest: } 9 \\text{ years old}, \\text{ Middle: } 9 \\text{ years old}, \\text{ Oldest: } 18 \\text{ years old}} \\]"
