        "content": "\"Yuppie\" is an American slang term that stands for \"Young Urban Professional.\" It was a term used in the 1980s to describe young, upwardly mobile, college-educated professionals who lived and worked in urban areas. Yuppies were typically associated with a certain lifestyle, including expensive tastes in fashion, food, and entertainment, as well as a focus on career advancement and material success. The term has since fallen out of common usage, but it remains a part of pop culture history."
