        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 50 widgets per hour, and each widget has a 10% chance of being defective. There are 8 working hours in a day. I need to find out the expected number of non-defective widgets produced in one day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of widgets produced in a day. Since the factory produces 50 widgets per hour and works for 8 hours, the total production per day would be:\n\nTotal widgets per day = 50 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 400 widgets\n\nNow, each widget has a 10% chance of being defective. That means the probability of a widget being defective is 10%, or 0.10. Therefore, the probability of a widget being non-defective is:\n\nProbability of non-defective = 1 - probability of defective = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90\n\nTo find the expected number of non-defective widgets, I can multiply the total number of widgets by the probability of being non-defective:\n\nExpected non-defective widgets = Total widgets per day * Probability of non-defective = 400 * 0.90 = 360\n\nSo, the expected number of non-defective widgets produced in one day is 360.\n\nBut let me double-check this. I recall that expected value is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing these products. In this case, each widget can be either defective or non-defective, with probabilities 0.10 and 0.90, respectively.\n\nSo, for each widget, the expected number of non-defective ones is 1 * 0.90 + 0 * 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nSince there are 400 widgets produced in a day, the total expected number of non-defective widgets would be 400 * 0.90 = 360.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the binomial distribution. The number of non-defective widgets would follow a binomial distribution with parameters n = 400 and p = 0.90. The expected value of a binomial distribution is n * p, which again is 400 * 0.90 = 360.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I arrive at the same expected value of 360 non-defective widgets per day.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation. For example, does the inspection process affect the number of defective widgets? The question says that each widget is inspected and has a 10% chance of being defective, but it doesn't mention that defective widgets are removed or that inspection affects the production process. So, I assume that all produced widgets are counted, whether defective or not, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlso, the question specifies that there are 8 working hours in a day, and production is constant at 50 widgets per hour. No mention of variations in production rate or anything like that, so I can proceed with the assumption that production is steady.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the defectiveness of one widget affects another. The problem states that each widget has a 10% chance of being defective, implying that the defectiveness is independent across widgets. So, I can treat each widget's defect status as an independent event.\n\nGiven all that, my calculation seems solid.\n\nJust to explore further, suppose I wanted to calculate the probability of having exactly 360 non-defective widgets in a day. That would involve using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the total number of trials (widgets), which is 400.\n\n- k is the number of successes (non-defective widgets), which is 360.\n\n- p is the probability of success (non-defective), which is 0.90.\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nHowever, calculating this exact probability isn't necessary for finding the expected value, which is what the question is asking for. So, while it's an interesting aside, it's not relevant to the main question.\n\nIn conclusion, the expected number of non-defective widgets produced in one day is 360.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
