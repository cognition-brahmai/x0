        "content": "The moment of inertia of a solid sphere about its diameter can be calculated using the formula:\n\nI = (2/5)MR\u00b2\n\nwhere:\n\nI is the moment of inertia\n\nM is the mass of the sphere\n\nR is the radius of the sphere\n\nThis formula can be derived using calculus by integrating the moment of inertia of infinitesimally small slices of the sphere.\n\nTo derive the formula, we can consider the sphere to be made up of infinitesimally thin disks stacked along the diameter. Each disk has a moment of inertia given by (1/2)mr\u00b2, where m is the mass of the disk and r is its radius.\n\nThe radius of each disk can be expressed in terms of its distance from the center of the sphere. Let's denote this distance as x. Then, the radius of the disk at a distance x from the center is given by:\n\nr = \u221a(R\u00b2 - x\u00b2)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe mass of each disk can be expressed in terms of the density of the sphere and the volume of the disk. The density \u03c1 of the sphere is given by:\n\n\u03c1 = M / (4/3 \u03c0 R\u00b3)\n\nThe volume of each disk is given by:\n\ndV = \u03c0 r\u00b2 dx = \u03c0 (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2) dx\n\nTherefore, the mass of each disk is:\n\ndm = \u03c1 dV = \u03c1 \u03c0 (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2) dx = [M / (4/3 \u03c0 R\u00b3)] \u03c0 (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2) dx = (3M / 4R\u00b3) (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2) dx\n\nNow, the moment of inertia of each disk is:\n\ndI = (1/2) dm r\u00b2 = (1/2) (3M / 4R\u00b3) (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2) dx (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2) = (3M / 8R\u00b3) (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2)\u00b2 dx\n\nTo find the total moment of inertia, we integrate dI over the entire sphere, from x = -R to x = R:\n\nI = \u222b dI = \u222b_{-R}^{R} (3M / 8R\u00b3) (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2)\u00b2 dx\n\nLet's expand (R\u00b2 - x\u00b2)\u00b2:\n\n(R\u00b2 - x\u00b2)\u00b2 = R\u2074 - 2R\u00b2x\u00b2 + x\u2074\n\nSo,\n\nI = (3M / 8R\u00b3) \u222b_{-R}^{R} (R\u2074 - 2R\u00b2x\u00b2 + x\u2074) dx\n\nSince the integrand is an even function, we can integrate from 0 to R and multiply by 2:\n\nI = (3M / 8R\u00b3) * 2 \u222b_{0}^{R} (R\u2074 - 2R\u00b2x\u00b2 + x\u2074) dx = (3M / 4R\u00b3) [ R\u2074 x - (2R\u00b2 x\u00b3)/3 + x\u2075/5 ] evaluated from 0 to R\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\nI = (3M / 4R\u00b3) [ R\u2074 * R - (2R\u00b2 * R\u00b3)/3 + R\u2075/5 - (0) ] = (3M / 4R\u00b3) [ R\u2075 - (2R\u2075)/3 + R\u2075/5 ]\n\nFactor out R\u2075:\n\nI = (3M / 4R\u00b3) R\u2075 [1 - 2/3 + 1/5] = (3M / 4R\u00b3) R\u2075 [ (15 - 10 + 3)/15 ] = (3M / 4R\u00b3) R\u2075 (8/15) = (3M R\u00b2 / 4) (8/15) = (24 M R\u00b2 / 60) = (2 M R\u00b2 / 5)\n\nTherefore, the moment of inertia of a solid sphere about its diameter is:\n\nI = (2/5) M R\u00b2\n\nThis is the standard formula for the moment of inertia of a solid sphere about its central axis."
