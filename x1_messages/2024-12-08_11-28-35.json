        "content": "So there are 30 students in the class. Half of them play soccer, so that would be 15 students. One-third play basketball, which is 10 students. And 6 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nI need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nOkay, so I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.\n\nFirst, the total number of students who play soccer or basketball is the number who play soccer plus the number who play basketball minus the number who play both, right?\n\nSo that's 15 + 10 - 6 = 19 students.\n\nThen, the number of students who don't play either sport would be the total number of students minus those who play soccer or basketball.\n\nSo, 30 - 19 = 11 students.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nIf 15 play soccer and 10 play basketball, and 6 play both, then the number who play only soccer is 15 - 6 = 9.\n\nThe number who play only basketball is 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nThen, the number who play either soccer or basketball is 9 + 4 + 6 = 19.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, 30 - 19 = 11 students don't play either sport.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
