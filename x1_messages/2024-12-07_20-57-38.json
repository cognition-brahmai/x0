        "content": "So there's this problem here. There are 30 students in a class, divided into 18 boys and 12 girls. The teacher wants to create groups with an equal number of boys and girls in each group. We need to find out the maximum number of such groups that can be formed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for each group to have an equal number of boys and girls. Does this mean that in each group, the number of boys should be the same as the number of girls? For example, each group could have 1 boy and 1 girl, or 2 boys and 2 girls, and so on.\n\nBut, we also have to consider the total numbers we're dealing with. There are 18 boys and 12 girls. So, if we try to form groups with 1 boy and 1 girl each, how many such groups can we make? Well, since there are fewer girls than boys, the number of groups would be limited by the number of girls. So, we could make 12 groups of 1 boy and 1 girl, but that would leave us with 6 boys without a group. But the problem asks for the maximum number of groups with an equal number of boys and girls in each group.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a better way to approach this. Maybe the groups don't all have to have the same number of boys and girls, but rather, within each group, the number of boys equals the number of girls. But, I think the spirit of the problem is to have groups where each group has the same number of boys and girls.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Let's assume that each group has b boys and b girls, since the number of boys equals the number of girls in each group. Then, the total number of boys used in all groups would be b times the number of groups, and similarly for girls.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of groups as g. Then, the total number of boys used would be b * g, and the total number of girls used would be b * g as well. But we have only 18 boys and 12 girls. So, we must have:\n\nb * g \u2264 18 (for boys)\n\nand\n\nb * g \u2264 12 (for girls)\n\nSince both expressions equal b * g, we can set them equal to each other:\n\nb * g \u2264 min(18, 12) = 12\n\nBut actually, since b * g must be less than or equal to both 18 and 12, the most restrictive condition is b * g \u2264 12.\n\nHowever, this seems too simplistic. Maybe I need to consider the ratios better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of boys and girls. The GCD would give me the largest possible number of groups where each group has the same number of boys and girls.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the GCD of 18 and 12.\n\nThe factors of 18 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\n\nThe factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nThe common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor is 6.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum number of groups that can be formed, with each group having the same number of boys and girls, is 6.\n\nLet\u2019s check this.\n\nIf we have 6 groups, and each group has the same number of boys and girls, then each group would have:\n\nNumber of boys per group: 18 / 6 = 3\n\nNumber of girls per group: 12 / 6 = 2\n\nWait a minute, but in this case, each group would have 3 boys and 2 girls, which does not satisfy the condition of having an equal number of boys and girls in each group.\n\nHmm, that\u2019s a problem. According to this, each group would have 3 boys and 2 girls, which is not equal.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to reconsider my approach.\n\nMaybe the GCD gives the number of groups, but then the number of boys and girls per group would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find the maximum number of groups where each group has the same number of boys and the same number of girls, but the number of boys per group does not necessarily equal the number of girls per group.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"an equal number of boys and girls in each group.\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"create groups with an equal number of boys and girls in each group.\"\n\nSo, in each group, the number of boys should be equal to the number of girls.\n\nBut, the total number of boys and girls in the class is different (18 boys and 12 girls).\n\nLet me try to think about this differently.\n\nSuppose each group has k students, with half boys and half girls. But since k must be even, let\u2019s say each group has 2m students, with m boys and m girls.\n\nThen, the total number of boys used would be m times the number of groups, and similarly for girls.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of groups as g.\n\nThen:\n\nm * g \u2264 18 (for boys)\n\nm * g \u2264 12 (for girls)\n\nWe need to maximize g, given that m is a positive integer.\n\nFrom the above inequalities, m * g \u2264 12, since 12 is the smaller of the two limits.\n\nBut m must divide both 18 and 12, because m * g must be a multiple of m that doesn't exceed the number of boys or girls.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the greatest common divisor again.\n\nWhat is the GCD of 18 and 12? As calculated earlier, it's 6.\n\nBut if m = 6, then:\n\nFor boys: 18 / 6 = 3 groups\n\nFor girls: 12 / 6 = 2 groups\n\nBut this doesn't make sense because the number of groups should be the same for both boys and girls.\n\nWait, perhaps m should be the number of boys and girls per group.\n\nLet me try to redefine m.\n\nLet\u2019s let each group have b boys and b girls, since the number must be equal.\n\nThen, the total number of boys used is b * g, and the total number of girls used is b * g.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nb * g \u2264 18 (boys)\n\nb * g \u2264 12 (girls)\n\nTherefore, b * g \u2264 12.\n\nWe need to maximize g, given that b is a positive integer.\n\nLet\u2019s consider possible values for b.\n\nb can be 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., but it must divide both 18 and 12.\n\nWait, b must be a common divisor of 18 and 12.\n\nThe common divisors of 18 and 12 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nLet\u2019s consider each possibility:\n\n1. b = 1:\n\nThen, g \u2264 12 / 1 = 12\n\nBut we also have to check the boys: g \u2264 18 / 1 = 18\n\nSo, g \u2264 12\n\n2. b = 2:\n\nThen, g \u2264 12 / 2 = 6\n\nAnd g \u2264 18 / 2 = 9\n\nSo, g \u2264 6\n\n3. b = 3:\n\nThen, g \u2264 12 / 3 = 4\n\nAnd g \u2264 18 / 3 = 6\n\nSo, g \u2264 4\n\n4. b = 6:\n\nThen, g \u2264 12 / 6 = 2\n\nAnd g \u2264 18 / 6 = 3\n\nSo, g \u2264 2\n\nAmong these options, the maximum g is 12 when b = 1.\n\nWait, but in that case, each group has 1 boy and 1 girl.\n\nTotal groups: 12\n\nBoys used: 12\n\nGirls used: 12\n\nBut there are 18 boys and 12 girls.\n\nSo, 12 groups of 1 boy and 1 girl each would use up 12 boys and 12 girls, leaving 6 boys without a group.\n\nBut the problem says \"create groups with an equal number of boys and girls in each group.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify that all students must be placed in a group.\n\nSo, forming 12 groups of 1 boy and 1 girl each seems acceptable, even if there are some boys left without a group.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to form more groups with higher values of b.\n\nWait, but with b = 1, g = 12\n\nWith b = 2, g = 6\n\nWith b = 3, g = 4\n\nWith b = 6, g = 2\n\nSo, the maximum number of groups is 12 when b = 1.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose b = 2, we can have 6 groups, each with 2 boys and 2 girls.\n\nThat would use up 12 boys and 12 girls, leaving 6 boys without a group.\n\nWith b = 3, we can have 4 groups, each with 3 boys and 3 girls, using up 12 boys and 12 girls, again leaving 6 boys without a group.\n\nWith b = 6, we can have 2 groups, each with 6 boys and 6 girls, using up 12 boys and 12 girls, leaving 6 boys without a group.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize the number of groups, regardless of whether all students are grouped or not, as long as each group has an equal number of boys and girls.\n\nSo, the maximum number of groups is 12, each with 1 boy and 1 girl.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to group the remaining 6 boys with some girls to form more groups.\n\nWait, but there are no more girls left.\n\nSo, those 6 boys cannot form groups with equal numbers of boys and girls.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of groups that can be formed with an equal number of boys and girls in each group is 12 groups of 1 boy and 1 girl each.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a better way.\n\nSuppose we form groups with different numbers of boys and girls, but that violates the condition of having an equal number in each group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can form some groups with more boys and girls accordingly.\n\nWait, but the condition is that each group must have an equal number of boys and girls.\n\nSo, in each group, the number of boys must equal the number of girls.\n\nTherefore, the only way to maximize the number of groups is to minimize the number of boys and girls per group.\n\nThat is, set b to the smallest possible value, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of groups is 12, each with 1 boy and 1 girl.\n\nAlternatively, if we set b = 2, we can have 6 groups, each with 2 boys and 2 girls.\n\nSimilarly, with b = 3, 4 groups with 3 boys and 3 girls each.\n\nWith b = 6, 2 groups with 6 boys and 6 girls each.\n\nBut to maximize the number of groups, we should choose the smallest b, which is 1, resulting in 12 groups.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 12 groups.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf we choose b = 1, g = 12\n\nBoys used: 12\n\nGirls used: 12\n\nBoys left: 6\n\nGirls left: 0\n\nIf we choose b = 2, g = 6\n\nBoys used: 12\n\nGirls used: 12\n\nBoys left: 6\n\nGirls left: 0\n\nSimilarly for higher b.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of groups is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
