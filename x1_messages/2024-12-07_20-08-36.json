        "content": "Let's see. So, the car travels 60 miles per hour for the first half of the trip and 40 miles per hour for the second half. The total distance is 200 miles. I need to find out how long the entire trip takes.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the first half and the second half of the trip are in terms of distance. Since the total distance is 200 miles, each half should be 100 miles.\n\nSo, the first half is 100 miles at 60 miles per hour, and the second half is 100 miles at 40 miles per hour.\n\nNow, to find the time for each half, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFor the first half:\n\nTime1 = 100 miles / 60 mph = 1.666... hours\n\nFor the second half:\n\nTime2 = 100 miles / 40 mph = 2.5 hours\n\nNow, to find the total time, I just need to add these two times together.\n\nTotal time = Time1 + Time2 = 1.666... + 2.5 = 4.166... hours\n\nBut maybe I should express that in hours and minutes. The decimal 0.166... hours is equivalent to 0.166... \u00d7 60 minutes, which is 10 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time is 4 hours and 10 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total time using the harmonic mean of the speeds since it's the same distance for each speed.\n\nThe formula for the average speed for the whole trip is:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nBut I can also use the formula for average speed when distances are equal:\n\nAverage speed = (2 \u00d7 speed1 \u00d7 speed2) / (speed1 + speed2)\n\nSo, average speed = (2 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 40) / (60 + 40) = (4800) / (100) = 48 mph\n\nNow, total time = total distance / average speed = 200 miles / 48 mph = 4.166... hours, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total time is 4 hours and 10 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should express it in decimal hours for precision.\n\n4.166... hours is exactly 4 + 1/6 hours. Since 1/6 hour is 10 minutes, yes, 4 hours and 10 minutes is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, 1/6 hour is exactly 10 minutes, so 4 hours and 10 minutes is fine.\n\nSo, the trip takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours and } 10 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
