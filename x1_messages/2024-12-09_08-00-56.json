        "content": "So the car is going at a steady speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2.5 hours to get to where it's going. You want to know how far the destination is from where it started, right?\n\nWell, to figure out distance when you know speed and time, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, Speed is 60 miles per hour, and Time is 2.5 hours. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2.5 hours\n\nWhen you multiply those, the hours unit cancels out, leaving you with miles.\n\nSo, 60 multiplied by 2.5 is 150.\n\nTherefore, the destination is 150 miles away from the starting point.\n\nBut let's double-check that. Another way to think about it is to consider that in one hour, the car covers 60 miles. So in 2 hours, it would cover 120 miles (because 60 \u00d7 2 = 120). Then, in half an hour, it would cover half of 60 miles, which is 30 miles. So, 120 miles plus 30 miles equals 150 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches the first calculation. So, the answer should be 150 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if you're familiar with dimensional analysis, you can set it up like this:\n\nDistance = (60 miles/hour) \u00d7 (2.5 hours) = 150 miles\n\nThe hours cancel out, leaving miles.\n\nSo, no matter how you look at it, the destination is 150 miles away.\n\nNow, just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this, like acceleration or something. But the problem says the car is traveling at a constant speed, so we don't have to worry about acceleration or deceleration. It's moving steadily at 60 miles per hour.\n\nAlso, it's important to ensure that the units are consistent. Here, speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so everything matches up nicely.\n\nIf the time was given in minutes, you'd need to convert it to hours to make the units compatible. But in this case, it's already in hours, so that's straightforward.\n\nSo, final answer: 150 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
