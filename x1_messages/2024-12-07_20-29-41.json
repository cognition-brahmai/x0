        "content": "Let's see. The store sells books for $15 each, and they're offering a 20% discount on every book. I need to find out how much I would pay for 7 books after the discount.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the discount amount is per book. A 20% discount on a $15 book. To find 20% of 15, I can calculate 0.20 times 15.\n\nSo, 0.20 * 15 = 3. That means each book has a $3 discount.\n\nNow, to find the discounted price per book, I subtract the discount from the original price: 15 - 3 = 12. So, each book costs $12 after the discount.\n\nNow, I need to buy 7 books. So, I multiply the discounted price per book by 7: 12 * 7.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 12 * 7 = 84.\n\nSo, I would pay $84 for 7 books after the discount.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this to verify? Maybe I can calculate the total original price first and then apply the discount.\n\nOkay, total original price for 7 books: 15 * 7 = 105.\n\nNow, apply a 20% discount on $105. To find 20% of 105, it's 0.20 * 105 = 21.\n\nSo, the discount is $21. Now, subtract that from the original total: 105 - 21 = 84.\n\nAgain, I get $84.\n\nAlright, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that's the correct amount I would pay for 7 books after the discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]\n"
