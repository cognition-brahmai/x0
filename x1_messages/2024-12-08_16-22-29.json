        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to create a Go program that watches a specific directory for new files, uploads them to Azure Blob Storage, and then deletes the local files. I'll need to use environment variables for configuration to make it flexible.\n\nFirst, I need to set up my Go environment and make sure I have the necessary packages. I'll need the `azure-storage-blob` package for interacting with Azure Blob Storage and probably the `fsnotify` package for watching the directory for file changes.\n\nLet me start by initializing a new Go module:\n\n```bash\nmkdir azure-file-uploader\ncd azure-file-uploader\ngo mod init github.com/yourusername/azure-file-uploader\n```\n\nNow, I need to add the required dependencies. I'll need to import the Azure Storage Blob client and the fsnotify package.\n\n```go\ngo get -u github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/azblob\ngo get -u github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\n```\n\nOkay, now I need to think about the structure of the program. It should continuously monitor a specified directory for new files. When a new file is detected, it should upload that file to an Azure Blob Storage container and then delete the local file.\n\nI should use environment variables for configuration, including the directory to watch, the Azure storage account name, account key, and the container name.\n\nLet me list out the environment variables I'll need:\n\n- `WATCH_DIRECTORY`: The local directory to watch for new files.\n\n- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`: The name of the Azure Storage account.\n\n- `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY`: The access key for the Azure Storage account.\n\n- `AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME`: The name of the container to upload files to.\n\nI need to make sure that these environment variables are set before running the program. I can add checks to ensure that all required environment variables are present.\n\nNow, let's think about the actual logic:\n\n1. Set up the Azure Blob Storage client using the account name and key.\n\n2. Create or check if the specified container exists.\n\n3. Set up a file watcher on the specified directory.\n\n4. When a new file is created in the directory, upload it to the Azure container and then delete the local file.\n\nI need to handle potential errors, such as failures in uploading the file or deleting the local file.\n\nAlso, I should consider that multiple files might be created at the same time, so I need to make sure that the program can handle concurrent file uploads if necessary.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll start with a single file upload at a time.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read environment variables.\n\n- Initialize Azure Blob Storage client.\n\n- Ensure the container exists.\n\n- Set up a file watcher on the directory.\n\n- Define a handler for new file creation events.\n\n- In the handler, upload the file to Azure and then delete the local file.\n\nI need to be careful with file locking or ensuring that the file is fully written before attempting to upload it. But for now, I'll assume that the files are dropped into the directory fully written.\n\nLet me start writing some code.\n\nFirst, reading environment variables:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/azblob\"\n\t\"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\twatchDir := os.Getenv(\"WATCH_DIRECTORY\")\n\taccountName := os.Getenv(\"AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT\")\n\taccountKey := os.Getenv(\"AZURE_STORAGE_KEY\")\n\tcontainerName := os.Getenv(\"AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME\")\n\n\tif watchDir == \"\" || accountName == \"\" || accountKey == \"\" || containerName == \"\" {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"All environment variables must be set: WATCH_DIRECTORY, AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT, AZURE_STORAGE_KEY, AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME\")\n\t}\n\n\t// Set up Azure Blob Storage client\n\tcredential, err := azblob.NewSharedKeyCredential(accountName, accountKey)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to create credentials: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tpipeline := azblob.NewPipeline(credential, azblob.PipelineOptions{})\n\tserviceURL := azblob.NewServiceURL(\n\t\tfmt.Sprintf(\"https://%s.blob.core.windows.net\", accountName),\n\t\tpipeline,\n\t)\n\n\t// Ensure container exists\n\tcontainerURL := serviceURL.NewContainerURL(containerName)\n\tctx := context.Background()\n\t_, err = containerURL.Create(ctx, azblob.Metadata{}, azblob.PublicAccessNone)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\t// Ignore already exists error\n\t\tif !azblob.IsResponseCodeErrorCode(err, azblob.ErrorCodeContainerAlreadyExists) {\n\t\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to create container: %v\", err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Set up file watcher\n\twatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to create watcher: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer watcher.Close()\n\n\tdone := make(chan bool)\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tfor {\n\t\t\tselect {\n\t\t\tcase event, ok := <-watcher.Events:\n\t\t\t\tif !ok {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tif event.Op&fsnotify.Create == fsnotify.Create {\n\t\t\t\t\tfmt.Printf(\"New file created: %s\\n\", event.Name)\n\t\t\t\t\tif err := uploadAndDeleteFile(ctx, event.Name, containerURL); err != nil {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Error processing file %s: %v\", event.Name, err)\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tcase err, ok := <-watcher.Errors:\n\t\t\t\tif !ok {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Error: %v\", err)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}()\n\n\terr = watcher.Add(watchDir)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to watch %s: %v\", watchDir, err)\n\t}\n\t<-done\n}\n\nfunc uploadAndDeleteFile(ctx context.Context, filePath string, containerURL azblob.ContainerURL) error {\n\tfile, err := os.Open(filePath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"failed to open file: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\t// Create a new blob with the same name as the file\n\tblobURL := containerURL.NewBlockBlobURL(filepath.Base(filePath))\n\n\t// Upload the file\n\t_, err = azblob.NewBufferedUploaderWithClient(containerURL.ServiceURL().Pipeline()).UploadBufferedToFile(\n\t\tctx,\n\t\tblobURL,\n\t\tfile,\n\t\tazblob.UploadBufferedToFileOptions{},\n\t)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"failed to upload file: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Delete the local file\n\terr = os.Remove(filePath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete local file: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\n\treturn nil\n}\n```\n\nWait a minute, I need to import `filepath` for `filepath.Base`.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the file is being written to and might not be complete yet. Maybe add a small delay before processing the file.\n\nLet me add a delay of, say, 5 seconds before processing the file to ensure it's fully written.\n\nI can do this by keeping track of when the file was last modified and waiting until there's no modification for 5 seconds.\n\nBut that might complicate things. For now, I'll proceed with the current approach, assuming files are dropped fully written.\n\nI should also consider file locking or some other mechanism to ensure the file isn't being written to when I try to upload it.\n\nBut again, for simplicity, I'll proceed as is.\n\nNow, I need to test this program.\n\nI'll set the environment variables:\n\n```bash\nexport WATCH_DIRECTORY=/path/to/watch\nexport AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=myaccount\nexport AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=mykey\nexport AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME=mycontainer\n```\n\nThen run the program:\n\n```bash\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nNow, if I create a new file in `/path/to/watch`, it should be uploaded to Azure Blob Storage and then deleted locally.\n\nI need to make sure that the Azure Storage account and container exist and that the account key is correct.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where the upload fails, perhaps by retrying or logging the error.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider logging the success or failure of each file upload and deletion.\n\nI can use the standard `log` package for this.\n\nLet me add some logging in the `uploadAndDeleteFile` function.\n\n```go\nfunc uploadAndDeleteFile(ctx context.Context, filePath string, containerURL azblob.ContainerURL) error {\n\tlog.Printf(\"Processing file: %s\", filePath)\n\n\tfile, err := os.Open(filePath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"failed to open file: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\tblobName := filepath.Base(filePath)\n\tblobURL := containerURL.NewBlockBlobURL(blobName)\n\n\t// Upload the file\n\t_, err = azblob.NewBufferedUploaderWithClient(containerURL.ServiceURL().Pipeline()).UploadBufferedToFile(\n\t\tctx,\n\t\tblobURL,\n\t\tfile,\n\t\tazblob.UploadBufferedToFileOptions{},\n\t)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"failed to upload file: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\tlog.Printf(\"Uploaded file: %s\", blobName)\n\n\t// Delete the local file\n\terr = os.Remove(filePath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete local file: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\tlog.Printf(\"Deleted local file: %s\", filePath)\n\n\treturn nil\n}\n```\n\nThis way, I can see logs for each file processed, uploaded, and deleted.\n\nI should also think about error handling and retries for upload failures.\n\nAzure SDK might have built-in retries, but I should confirm that.\n\nAccording to the Azure SDK documentation, retries are handled by default, but I can configure them if needed.\n\nFor now, I'll rely on the default retry policies.\n\nAnother consideration is that if multiple files are created rapidly, the program should handle them sequentially without blocking.\n\nSince fsnotify delivers events asynchronously, and I'm processing each event in the select statement, it should handle multiple files without issues.\n\nHowever, if file processing takes too long, it might queue up events.\n\nTo handle this, I could process files in separate goroutines, but then I need to manage potential concurrent access issues.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and process files sequentially.\n\nIf performance becomes an issue, I can look into processing files concurrently.\n\nI should also think about what happens if the program is stopped or crashes.\n\nAny files that were in the process of being uploaded might be left in an inconsistent state.\n\nTo handle this, I could implement some form of checkpointing or use more robust file handling.\n\nBut for this simple program, I'll assume that the program will be supervised and restarted if necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that fsnotify might not catch all file creation events, especially in busy directories.\n\nBut again, for this use case, I'll assume that fsnotify is sufficient.\n\nI should also make sure that the program can handle large files without running out of memory.\n\nSince I'm using a buffered uploader, it should handle large files efficiently.\n\nI need to confirm the buffer size and make sure it's configured properly.\n\nAccording to the Azure SDK documentation, the buffered uploader manages buffering and uploading blocks of data, so it should handle large files fine.\n\nI can adjust the buffer size if needed, but for now, I'll use the defaults.\n\nLet me think about how to stop the program gracefully.\n\nCurrently, the program runs indefinitely, listening for file events.\n\nTo stop it, I can send a signal or close the watcher channel.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll let the program run until interrupted.\n\nI can add a SIGINT handler to clean up and exit properly.\n\nLet me add that.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\t// ... (previous code)\n\n\twatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to create watcher: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer watcher.Close()\n\n\tdone := make(chan bool)\n\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tfor {\n\t\t\tselect {\n\t\t\tcase event, ok := <-watcher.Events:\n\t\t\t\tif !ok {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tif event.Op&fsnotify.Create == fsnotify.Create {\n\t\t\t\t\tfmt.Printf(\"New file created: %s\\n\", event.Name)\n\t\t\t\t\tif err := uploadAndDeleteFile(ctx, event.Name, containerURL); err != nil {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Error processing file %s: %v\", event.Name, err)\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tcase err, ok := <-watcher.Errors:\n\t\t\t\tif !ok {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Error: %v\", err)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}()\n\n\terr = watcher.Add(watchDir)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to watch %s: %v\", watchDir, err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Handle SIGINT to stop the program gracefully\n\tc := make(chan os.Signal, 1)\n\tsignal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt)\n\tgo func() {\n\t\t<-c\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Stopping program...\")\n\t\twatcher.Close()\n\t\tdone <- true\n\t}()\n\n\t<-done\n}\n```\n\nThis way, when I press Ctrl+C, the program will close the watcher and exit cleanly.\n\nI should also consider logging the start of the program and any configuration settings.\n\nLet me add a start message.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\twatchDir := os.Getenv(\"WATCH_DIRECTORY\")\n\taccountName := os.Getenv(\"AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT\")\n\tcontainerName := os.Getenv(\"AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME\")\n\n\tlog.Printf(\"Watching directory: %s\", watchDir)\n\tlog.Printf(\"Azure Storage Account: %s\", accountName)\n\tlog.Printf(\"Azure Container: %s\", containerName)\n\n\t// ... (rest of the code)\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all required packages are imported.\n\nLet me check the imports:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"os/signal\"\n\t\"syscall\"\n\n\t\"github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/azblob\"\n\t\"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n```\n\nWait, I used `filepath.Base`, but I didn't import `path/filepath`. I need to add that.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"os/signal\"\n\t\"path/filepath\"\n\t\"syscall\"\n\n\t\"github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/azblob\"\n\t\"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n```\n\nGood.\n\nI should also handle the case where the container already exists without failing.\n\nIn the current code, if the container exists, it ignores the error. That's fine.\n\nBut maybe I should check if the container exists before trying to create it, to avoid unnecessary create attempts.\n\nHowever, creating a container that already exists will just return an error, which I'm already handling, so it's okay.\n\nI think this should suffice for now.\n\nI need to test this program thoroughly.\n\nFirst, set up the environment variables.\n\nMake sure that the Azure Storage account and container exist.\n\nCreate a new file in the watched directory and see if it gets uploaded and deleted.\n\nCheck the Azure portal or use Azure CLI to verify that the file is uploaded.\n\nAlso, check the program's logs to see if it reports success.\n\nIf everything works as expected, then I can consider the program complete.\n\nOtherwise, I need to debug any issues that arise.\n\nPotential issues could be permission problems with Azure Storage, file access errors, or fsnotify not detecting file creations.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as very large files, files with special characters in their names, and files being created and deleted rapidly.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the program handles these cases adequately.\n\nI can always add more robust error handling and logging if needed based on testing.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Go program that monitors a specified directory for new files, uploads them to an Azure Blob Storage container, and then deletes the local copy, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Azure Storage Account**: Ensure you have an Azure Storage account and note down the account name and key.\n2. **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables for configuration.\n3. **Go Modules**: Initialize a new Go module and install dependencies.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"os/signal\"\n    \"path/filepath\"\n    \"syscall\"\n\n    \"github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/azblob\"\n    \"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    watchDir := os.Getenv(\"WATCH_DIRECTORY\")\n    accountName := os.Getenv(\"AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT\")\n    accountKey := os.Getenv(\"AZURE_STORAGE_KEY\")\n    containerName := os.Getenv(\"AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME\")\n\n    if watchDir == \"\" || accountName == \"\" || accountKey == \"\" || containerName == \"\" {\n        log.Fatal(\"All environment variables must be set: WATCH_DIRECTORY, AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT, AZURE_STORAGE_KEY, AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME\")\n    }\n\n    log.Printf(\"Watching directory: %s\", watchDir)\n    log.Printf(\"Azure Storage Account: %s\", accountName)\n    log.Printf(\"Azure Container: %s\", containerName)\n\n    // Set up Azure Blob Storage client\n    credential, err := azblob.NewSharedKeyCredential(accountName, accountKey)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to create credentials: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    pipeline := azblob.NewPipeline(credential, azblob.PipelineOptions{})\n    serviceURL := azblob.NewServiceURL(\n        fmt.Sprintf(\"https://%s.blob.core.windows.net\", accountName),\n        pipeline,\n    )\n\n    // Ensure container exists\n    containerURL := serviceURL.NewContainerURL(containerName)\n    ctx := context.Background()\n    _, err = containerURL.Create(ctx, azblob.Metadata{}, azblob.PublicAccessNone)\n    if err != nil {\n        // Ignore already exists error\n        if !azblob.IsResponseCodeErrorCode(err, azblob.ErrorCodeContainerAlreadyExists) {\n            log.Fatalf(\"Failed to create container: %v\", err)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Set up file watcher\n    watcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to create watcher: %v\", err)\n    }\n    defer watcher.Close()\n\n    done := make(chan bool)\n    go func() {\n        for {\n            select {\n            case event, ok := <-watcher.Events:\n                if !ok {\n                    return\n                }\n                if event.Op&fsnotify.Create == fsnotify.Create {\n                    fmt.Printf(\"New file created: %s\\n\", event.Name)\n                    if err := uploadAndDeleteFile(ctx, event.Name, containerURL);
