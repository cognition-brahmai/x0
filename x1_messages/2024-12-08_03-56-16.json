        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are five houses in a row, each painted a different color: green, white, red, blue, and yellow. Each house has an owner who has a specific habit: drinking coffee, having a cat, smoking cigars, drinking tea, or drinking milk. I need to find out who owns the white house.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n1. The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.\n\n2. The owner of the red house drinks coffee.\n\n3. The owner of the blue house has a cat.\n\n4. The person who lives in the yellow house smokes cigars.\n\n5. The owner of the green house drinks tea.\n\n6. The person living in the middle house drinks milk.\n\nSince there are five houses in a row, let's number them from 1 to 5, left to right.\n\nSo, house 1 is on the far left, and house 5 is on the far right.\n\nNow, let's see what we can deduce.\n\nFirst, the green house is immediately to the left of the white house. That means the green and white houses must be next to each other, with green on the left and white on the right.\n\nSo, possible pairs could be:\n\n- House 1 (green) and House 2 (white)\n\n- House 2 (green) and House 3 (white)\n\n- House 3 (green) and House 4 (white)\n\n- House 4 (green) and House 5 (white)\n\nThat's four possible pairs.\n\nNext, the owner of the red house drinks coffee.\n\nThe owner of the blue house has a cat.\n\nThe owner of the yellow house smokes cigars.\n\nThe owner of the green house drinks tea.\n\nAnd the person in the middle house (house 3) drinks milk.\n\nSo, house 3 drinks milk.\n\nWait, but the owner of the green house drinks tea.\n\nSo, the green house cannot be house 3, because house 3 drinks milk.\n\nTherefore, the green house cannot be house 3.\n\nTherefore, the green and white houses cannot be houses 2 and 3, because that would make green house 2 and white house 3, but house 3 drinks milk, not tea.\n\nSimilarly, if green is house 3, which we've already ruled out.\n\nSo, possible pairs are:\n\n- House 1 (green), House 2 (white)\n\n- House 4 (green), House 5 (white)\n\nNow, let's consider house 3 drinks milk, and it's not green, as we've established.\n\nSo, house 3 must be one of red, blue, or yellow.\n\nSimilarly, green is either house 1 or 4.\n\nWait, but let's think about all possibilities.\n\nWait, no, green can be house 1, 2, 4, or 5, but not house 5, because white has to be to the right of green.\n\nWait, no, green can't be house 5, because there's no house to its right for white.\n\nSo, green can be house 1, 2, or 4.\n\nWait, but if green is house 4, white is house 5.\n\nIf green is house 2, white is house 3, but house 3 drinks milk, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, unless the green house is house 1 or 4.\n\nWait, let's re-examine.\n\nIf green is house 1, white is house 2.\n\nHouse 3 drinks milk.\n\nGreen house drinks tea.\n\nRed house drinks coffee.\n\nBlue house has a cat.\n\nYellow house smokes cigars.\n\nWe need to assign colors and habits to houses 1 through 5.\n\nLet me try to make a table.\n\n| House | Color | Drink |\n\n|-------|-------|-------|\n\n| 1     |       |       |\n\n| 2     |       |       |\n\n| 3     |       | Milk  |\n\n| 4     |       |       |\n\n| 5     |       |       |\n\nNow, green is to the left of white, so possible pairs are:\n\n- House 1 (green), House 2 (white)\n\n- House 2 (green), House 3 (white) \u2013 but house 3 drinks milk, so green house drinks tea, which contradicts.\n\n- House 4 (green), House 5 (white)\n\nSo, only possible pairs are House 1 & 2 or House 4 & 5.\n\nLet's consider House 1 (green), House 2 (white).\n\nThen, green house drinks tea, so house 1 drinks tea.\n\nHouse 3 drinks milk.\n\nNow, who drinks coffee? The red house drinks coffee.\n\nWe need to assign red, blue, and yellow to houses 4 and 5, but wait, in this scenario, house 2 is white, house 1 is green, house 3 is milk, so house 4 and 5 would be red, blue, or yellow.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, house 4 and 5 are not necessarily both red, blue, or yellow; one of them is already white, and green is house 1.\n\nWait, no, white is house 2, green is house 1.\n\nSo, houses 4 and 5 would be red, blue, or yellow.\n\nSimilarly, house 3 is milk, house 1 is tea, house 2 is white (unknown drink), house 4 and 5 are unknown drinks.\n\nBut the red house drinks coffee, the green house drinks tea, the yellow house smokes cigars, the blue house has a cat.\n\nWait, but the question seems to mix drinks and habits; perhaps some are drinks and some are hobbies or something else.\n\nWait, let's read the question again.\n\n\"There are 5 houses in a row, each painted a different color. The green house is immediately to the left of the white house. The owner of the red house drinks coffee. The owner of the blue house has a cat. The person who lives in the yellow house smokes cigars. The owner of the green house drinks tea. The person living in the middle house drinks milk. Who owns the white house?\"\n\nSo, seems like some owners drink something, some have pets, some smoke.\n\nBut in the context, perhaps drinking is a habit, and having a cat and smoking cigars are other habits.\n\nBut the red house drinks coffee, green house drinks tea, middle house drinks milk.\n\nSo, perhaps drinking is specific to certain houses, while others have different habits.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps drinking is one type of habit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe drinking, smoking, and having pets are all separate habits.\n\nBut the question is a bit unclear.\n\nFor now, let's assume that drinking, smoking, and having pets are all different habits associated with each house.\n\nSo, each house has one color, one drink, one pet, and one smoking habit.\n\nWait, but the question only mentions drinking for red and green, smoking cigars for yellow, and having a cat for blue.\n\nIt doesn't specify all houses have all categories.\n\nPerhaps some houses only have one of these attributes mentioned, and the rest are unknown.\n\nIn that case, it's more complicated.\n\nBut perhaps, for the sake of solving this, we can assume that each house has one drink, one pet, and one smoking habit, but that may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only some houses have specified habits, and the rest don't.\n\nBut that might make it unsolvable.\n\nLet me try to list out all the given facts again:\n\n1. The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.\n\n2. The owner of the red house drinks coffee.\n\n3. The owner of the blue house has a cat.\n\n4. The person who lives in the yellow house smokes cigars.\n\n5. The owner of the green house drinks tea.\n\n6. The person living in the middle house drinks milk.\n\nAnd the question is: Who owns the white house?\n\nPresumably, we need to determine the color of the house owned by a specific person, but it's not clear from the question. Maybe I misread it.\n\nWait, the question says \"Who owns the white house?\" meaning, which house owner owns the white house.\n\nBut it seems like all houses are owned by different people, each with their own preferences.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find out which color is the white house.\n\nWait, no, it says \"who owns the white house\", perhaps referring to identifying the owner based on their habits.\n\nBut it's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"who\" refers to which color house owns the white house, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps \"who\" refers to which house color is the white house.\n\nIn that case, we need to determine the position or the owner's habits of the white house.\n\nBut it's still unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are five people, each living in a house of a certain color, with certain habits, and I need to match them up.\n\nBut the question seems to be missing some information for a standard logic puzzle.\n\nPerhaps I need to make some assumptions.\n\nLet me try to proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, from fact 1: The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.\n\nSo, green and white are next to each other, with green on the left.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- House 1 (green), House 2 (white)\n\n- House 2 (green), House 3 (white)\n\n- House 3 (green), House 4 (white)\n\n- House 4 (green), House 5 (white)\n\nBut, from fact 6: The person living in the middle house (house 3) drinks milk.\n\nFrom fact 5: The owner of the green house drinks tea.\n\nSo, the green house cannot be house 3, because house 3 drinks milk, not tea.\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs are:\n\n- House 1 (green), House 2 (white)\n\n- House 2 (green), House 3 (white) \u2013 but house 3 drinks milk, which contradicts fact 5, since green house drinks tea, not milk.\n\n- House 4 (green), House 5 (white)\n\nSo, only possible pairs are House 1 and 2, or House 4 and 5.\n\nTherefore, the green and white houses are either the first two houses or the last two houses.\n\nLet's consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: Green is house 1, white is house 2.\n\nThen, house 3 is the middle house, drinks milk.\n\nHouse 4 and 5 are yellow, red, or blue.\n\nNow, the owner of the red house drinks coffee.\n\nThe owner of the green house drinks tea.\n\nHouse 3 drinks milk.\n\nSo, house 1 (green) drinks tea.\n\nHouse 3 drinks milk.\n\nHouse 2 (white) \u2013 unknown drink.\n\nHouse 4 and 5 \u2013 unknown drinks, but one is red and drinks coffee.\n\nSimilarly, the yellow house smokes cigars, and the blue house has a cat.\n\nBut we don't have information about pets or smoking for other houses.\n\nThis seems insufficient to determine the owner of the white house.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more constraints that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps there are more facts that need to be considered.\n\nWait, the question only provided these facts, so perhaps I need to make some assumptions or look for implicit information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is similar to the Einstein riddle, where more information is required to solve it.\n\nBut given the limited facts, perhaps I can make a table and see.\n\nLet's try to list the houses and their attributes.\n\n| House | Color   | Drink   |\n\n|-------|---------|---------|\n\n| 1     | Green   | Tea     |\n\n| 2     | White   | ?       |\n\n| 3     | ?       | Milk    |\n\n| 4     | ?       | ?       |\n\n| 5     | ?       | ?       |\n\nIn this scenario, where green is house 1 and white is house 2.\n\nNow, the red house drinks coffee.\n\nThe blue house has a cat.\n\nThe yellow house smokes cigars.\n\nBut these may not be directly related to the drinks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each house has a unique combination of color, drink, pet, and smoking habit.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only about determining the color of the houses and their drinks, and the other attributes are just additional information.\n\nBut it's still unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that each house has a unique color, a unique drink, and possibly unique pets and smoking habits, but without more constraints, it's impossible to solve.\n\nGiven the limited information, perhaps the answer is that the owner of the white house is the one who has a cat, assuming that the blue house has a cat and is not the white house.\n\nBut that may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the white house is owned by the person who drinks coffee, assuming it's the red house.\n\nBut again, that may not be accurate.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and insufficient information, I'm unable to definitively determine who owns the white house.\n\nPerhaps there are missing premises or additional clues that could help solve this puzzle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is simply that the owner of the white house is the one who has a cat, assuming that the blue house has a cat and is the white house.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the owner of the white house is the one who drinks coffee, if the red house drinks coffee and is adjacent to the green house.\n\nBut without more information, it's impossible to say for sure.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I cannot determine who owns the white house.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Insufficient information to determine who owns the white house.}} \\]"
