        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train traveling from Town A to Town B and then to Town C. It says the train takes 2 hours to go from Town A to Town B, and then an additional 1 hour to go from Town B to Town C. The distance between Town A and Town B is 120 kilometers, and the train maintains a constant speed throughout the entire journey. I need to find the total distance traveled by the train.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The total distance traveled by the train would be the sum of the distances from Town A to Town B and from Town B to Town C. I already know the distance from Town A to Town B is 120 kilometers, so I need to find the distance from Town B to Town C and then add it to 120 kilometers.\n\nThe problem mentions that the train maintains a constant speed throughout the entire journey. That's important because it means the speed from Town A to Town B is the same as from Town B to Town C.\n\nLet me denote the constant speed of the train as \"s\" kilometers per hour.\n\nFirst, I can use the information from Town A to Town B to find the speed. The formula for speed is:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nI know the distance from A to B is 120 kilometers and the time is 2 hours. So,\n\ns = 120 km / 2 hours = 60 km/h\n\nSo, the train's constant speed is 60 kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, I need to find the distance from Town B to Town C. I know the time taken for this part of the journey is 1 hour, and the speed is still 60 km/h.\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance from B to C = 60 km/h \u00d7 1 hour = 60 kilometers\n\nTherefore, the distance from Town B to Town C is 60 kilometers.\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled by the train, I add the distances from A to B and B to C:\n\nTotal distance = 120 km + 60 km = 180 kilometers\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? The train travels from A to B and then from B to C. It doesn't mention returning or any other stops. So, the total distance should indeed be 180 kilometers.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to be sure. From A to B: 120 km in 2 hours at 60 km/h. From B to C: 1 hour at 60 km/h, so 60 km. Total: 120 + 60 = 180 km.\n\nThat seems straightforward. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
