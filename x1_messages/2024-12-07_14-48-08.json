        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of pens: Type A costs $0.75 each, and Type B costs $1.25 each. I need to buy a total of 12 pens and spend exactly $10. I need to figure out how many of each type I bought.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A pens.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B pens.\n\nFrom the problem, I know two things:\n\n1. The total number of pens is 12, so \\( x + y = 12 \\).\n\n2. The total cost is $10, and since Type A pens cost $0.75 each and Type B pens cost $1.25 each, the cost equation would be \\( 0.75x + 1.25y = 10 \\).\n\nSo, I have a system of two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx + y = 12 \\\\\n0.75x + 1.25y = 10\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nI need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let's see. One way to solve this is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 12 - y\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n0.75(12 - y) + 1.25y = 10\n\\]\n\nAlright, let's calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.75 by 12:\n\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 12 = 9\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply 0.75 by \\( -y \\):\n\n\\[\n0.75 \\times (-y) = -0.75y\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n9 - 0.75y + 1.25y = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[\n9 + (1.25y - 0.75y) = 10 \\\\\n9 + 0.5y = 10\n\\]\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.5y = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 2 \\), which means I bought 2 Type B pens.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation \\( x = 12 - y \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 12 - 2 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, I bought 10 Type A pens and 2 Type B pens.\n\nWait, let me check if this makes sense. Type A pens are $0.75 each, so 10 of them would cost:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 0.75 = 7.50\n\\]\n\nType B pens are $1.25 each, so 2 of them would cost:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 1.25 = 2.50\n\\]\n\nAdding those up:\n\n\\[\n7.50 + 2.50 = 10\n\\]\n\nPerfect, that adds up to $10, which matches the total amount spent. Also, 10 plus 2 equals 12 pens, which matches the total number of pens bought.\n\nSo, the answer is 10 Type A pens and 2 Type B pens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ Type A pens and } 2 \\text{ Type B pens}} \\]"
