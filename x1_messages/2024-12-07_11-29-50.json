        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two solutions: one is 25% acid and the other is 60% acid. We need to mix these to create 5 liters of a 40% acid solution. The goal is to figure out how many liters of each solution to use.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- \\( x \\) = liters of the 25% acid solution\n\n- \\( y \\) = liters of the 60% acid solution\n\nWe know that the total volume of the mixture should be 5 liters, so:\n\n\\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\nNext, we need to consider the amount of pure acid in each solution. The total amount of acid from both solutions should equal the amount of acid in the final mixture.\n\nThe amount of acid in the 25% solution is \\( 0.25x \\), and in the 60% solution, it's \\( 0.60y \\). The final mixture should be 40% acid, so the total acid in the mixture is \\( 0.40 \\times 5 = 2 \\) liters.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\( 0.25x + 0.60y = 2 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( 0.25x + 0.60y = 2 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I\u2019ll use the substitution method.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\( x = 5 - y \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( x \\) in equation 2:\n\n\\( 0.25(5 - y) + 0.60y = 2 \\)\n\nLet\u2019s distribute the 0.25:\n\n\\( 1.25 - 0.25y + 0.60y = 2 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 1.25 + 0.35y = 2 \\)\n\nSubtract 1.25 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.35y = 0.75 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.35:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{0.75}{0.35} = \\frac{75}{35} = \\frac{15}{7} \\approx 2.1429 \\) liters\n\nNow, plug \\( y \\) back into equation 1 to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 5 - \\frac{15}{7} = \\frac{35}{7} - \\frac{15}{7} = \\frac{20}{7} \\approx 2.8571 \\) liters\n\nSo, the chemist should mix approximately 2.857 liters of the 25% acid solution and 2.143 liters of the 60% acid solution to create 5 liters of a 40% acid solution.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if these values make sense. If we add \\( \\frac{20}{7} + \\frac{15}{7} = \\frac{35}{7} = 5 \\) liters, which matches the total volume required.\n\nNow, let's verify the acid content:\n\n- Acid from 25% solution: \\( 0.25 \\times \\frac{20}{7} = \\frac{5}{7} \\) liters\n\n- Acid from 60% solution: \\( 0.60 \\times \\frac{15}{7} = \\frac{9}{7} \\) liters\n\n- Total acid: \\( \\frac{5}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} = \\frac{14}{7} = 2 \\) liters, which is 40% of 5 liters.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{20}{7} \\text{ liters of 25% acid solution and } \\frac{15}{7} \\text{ liters of 60% acid solution}} \\]\n\nor approximately 2.857 liters and 2.143 liters, respectively."
