        "content": "So the farmer has 100 meters of fencing material and wants to make a rectangular enclosure for his sheep. He wants to maximize the area inside this rectangle. Hmm, I remember that for a given perimeter, there's a specific shape that gives the maximum area. I think it's when the rectangle is a square, but let me confirm that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas for perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by P = 2(length + width). In this case, the perimeter is fixed at 100 meters, so 2(l + w) = 100. I can simplify that to l + w = 50.\n\nNow, the area (A) of a rectangle is A = length \u00d7 width, or A = l \u00d7 w. I need to maximize A given that l + w = 50.\n\nThis seems like an optimization problem. Maybe I can express the area in terms of one variable and then find its maximum.\n\nLet me solve for one variable in terms of the other using the perimeter equation. From l + w = 50, I can express length as l = 50 - w.\n\nNow, substitute this into the area formula: A = (50 - w) \u00d7 w = 50w - w\u00b2.\n\nSo, A = 50w - w\u00b2.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of w, and it's in the form of A = -w\u00b2 + 50w. I know that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of w\u00b2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, meaning the vertex represents the maximum point.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola given by f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -1 and b = 50, so the width (w) at the maximum area is w = -50/(2*(-1)) = 25 meters.\n\nThen, the length (l) is l = 50 - w = 50 - 25 = 25 meters.\n\nWait a minute, so both length and width are 25 meters. That means the rectangle is actually a square.\n\nIs that right? Let me check with other values to see if this indeed gives the maximum area.\n\nSuppose I choose w = 20 meters, then l = 50 - 20 = 30 meters, and A = 20 \u00d7 30 = 600 m\u00b2.\n\nIf w = 25 meters, l = 25 meters, A = 25 \u00d7 25 = 625 m\u00b2.\n\nIf w = 30 meters, l = 20 meters, A = 30 \u00d7 20 = 600 m\u00b2.\n\nYes, 625 is larger than 600. Let me try another value.\n\nIf w = 10 meters, l = 40 meters, A = 10 \u00d7 40 = 400 m\u00b2, which is less than 625.\n\nIf w = 24 meters, l = 26 meters, A = 24 \u00d7 26 = 624 m\u00b2, which is still less than 625.\n\nSo, it seems that when w = 25 meters and l = 25 meters, the area is indeed maximized at 625 m\u00b2.\n\nI think this makes sense because for a given perimeter, a square encloses the maximum possible area. It's a property of squares and rectangles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's a way to get a larger area with different dimensions.\n\nSuppose I make the rectangle longer in one side, say w = 1 meter, then l = 49 meters, A = 1 \u00d7 49 = 49 m\u00b2, which is way less than 625.\n\nOr w = 30 meters, l = 20 meters, A = 600 m\u00b2, still less.\n\nAlternatively, w = 26 meters, l = 24 meters, A = 26 \u00d7 24 = 624 m\u00b2, which is less than 625.\n\nIt seems consistent that the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square with sides of 25 meters.\n\nLet me also consider if there's a calculus way to approach this, since I recall that in optimization problems, we can take derivatives to find maxima.\n\nGiven A = 50w - w\u00b2, taking the derivative dA/dw = 50 - 2w.\n\nSetting dA/dw = 0 to find critical points: 50 - 2w = 0 \u21d2 w = 25 meters.\n\nThen, second derivative d\u00b2A/dw\u00b2 = -2, which is negative, indicating a maximum.\n\nSo, calculus confirms that w = 25 meters gives the maximum area.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions for the largest possible area are 25 meters by 25 meters, enclosing an area of 625 square meters.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me double-check if there's any constraint I'm missing.\n\nThe farmer has 100 meters of fencing, and we've used all of it to enclose the rectangle with sides 25 meters each.\n\nYes, 2 \u00d7 (25 + 25) = 100 meters.\n\nEverything seems to add up.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the largest possible area that the farmer can enclose are \\boxed{25 \\text{ meters by } 25 \\text{ meters}}."
