        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that travels 100 miles in 2 hours, and it's maintaining a constant speed. We need to find out how many miles it will travel in 3 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to find the train's speed. Since speed is distance divided by time, I can calculate it by dividing 100 miles by 2 hours. That gives me 50 miles per hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how far the train will go in 3 hours and 30 minutes at this constant speed. But wait, 3 hours and 30 minutes is not a whole number of hours, so I should convert that to hours. 30 minutes is half an hour, so 3 hours and 30 minutes is 3.5 hours.\n\nSo, if the train travels at 50 miles per hour, in 3.5 hours it will cover 50 times 3.5 miles.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 50 times 3 is 150, and 50 times 0.5 is 25, so total 150 plus 25 equals 175 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours, then how many miles does it travel in 1 hour? That would be 100 divided by 2, which is 50 miles per hour. So, again, that matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, for 3.5 hours, it would be 50 miles per hour times 3.5 hours, which is again 175 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion: 100 miles is to 2 hours as x miles is to 3.5 hours.\n\nSo, 100/2 = x/3.5.\n\nSolving for x, I get x = (100/2) * 3.5 = 50 * 3.5 = 175 miles.\n\nHmm, all these methods are leading me to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut let's double-check the units to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The original time is in hours and the distance is in miles, and the speed is consistent throughout.\n\nAlso, ensuring that 3 hours and 30 minutes is correctly converted to 3.5 hours is important. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how far the train travels in half an hour. Since it travels 50 miles in one hour, in half an hour it would travel 25 miles.\n\nSo, in 3 hours, it would travel 3 * 50 = 150 miles, and in additional 0.5 hours, it would travel 25 miles, totaling 175 miles.\n\nThis consistent result gives me confidence in the answer.\n\nIs there any other way this problem could be interpreted? Maybe considering that the train might not be moving for the entire time, but the problem says it maintains a constant speed, so it's probably moving continuously.\n\nAlso, sometimes problems might involve acceleration or breaks, but this one specifies constant speed, so I don't need to consider those factors.\n\nSo, I think 175 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{175} \\]"
