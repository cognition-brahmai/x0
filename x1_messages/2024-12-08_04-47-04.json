While they can cause mild irritation or discomfort if ingested, they are not extremely toxic to humans or cats. In most cases, ingestion leads to minor symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or mouth irritation. It's always a good idea to keep plants out of reach of children and pets, but poinsettias are generally safe in households."
