        "content": "So the company has a monthly budget of $10,000 for employee salaries, and there are 20 employees who all receive the same salary. To find out how much each employee earns per month before taxes, I need to divide the total salary budget by the number of employees.\n\nSo, that would be $10,000 divided by 20 employees.\n\nLet me do the math: 10,000 divided by 20 is 500.\n\nSo, each employee earns $500 per month before taxes.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I need to consider here? Are there any deductions or additional costs the company might have for each employee that could affect the salary amount?\n\nHmm, the question says \"before taxes,\" so I don't need to worry about tax deductions in this calculation. It's just about dividing the total salary budget equally among all employees.\n\nSo, yes, each employee earns $500 per month before taxes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
