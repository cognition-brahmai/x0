        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you calculate the volume of a cylinder step by step. So, the formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the radius \\( r \\) is 4 cm and the height \\( h \\) is 10 cm, we can plug these values into the formula.\n\nFirst, let's write down the formula again with the given values:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 4^2 \\times 10 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\( 4^2 \\). Squaring a number means multiplying the number by itself, so:\n\n\\[ 4^2 = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\]\n\nSo now the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 16 \\times 10 \\]\n\nNext, we can multiply 16 by 10:\n\n\\[ 16 \\times 10 = 160 \\]\n\nNow, the formula simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 160 \\]\n\nThe value of \\( \\pi \\) (pi) is approximately 3.14159. So, multiplying 160 by \u03c0 gives:\n\n\\[ V \\approx 3.14159 \\times 160 \\]\n\nLet's do this multiplication:\n\n\\[ 3.14159 \\times 160 = 502.6544 \\]\n\nSo, the volume of the cylinder is approximately 502.6544 cubic centimeters.\n\nHowever, since the original measurements were given to a certain precision (radius and height are given in whole numbers), it's common to round the final answer to a reasonable number of decimal places. Let's round it to two decimal places:\n\n\\[ V \\approx 502.65 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to express the volume in terms of \u03c0, you can leave it as:\n\n\\[ V = 160\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nBut typically, people prefer the numerical value, so 502.65 cm\u00b3 is acceptable.\n\nJust to double-check, let's ensure we've used the correct formula and applied the values correctly. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is indeed \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), and we've substituted \\( r = 4 \\) cm and \\( h = 10 \\) cm correctly. The calculations seem accurate, so we can be confident in our answer.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{502.65 \\, \\text{cm}^3} \\]"
