        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a box with red, blue, and green balls. The ratios given are:\n\n- The ratio of red to blue balls is 3:2.\n\n- The ratio of blue to green balls is 4:5.\n\nAnd we're told there are 24 blue balls in the box. We need to find the total number of balls in the box.\n\nFirst, let's understand what these ratios mean. The ratio of red to blue balls is 3:2, which means for every 3 red balls, there are 2 blue balls. Similarly, the ratio of blue to green balls is 4:5, meaning for every 4 blue balls, there are 5 green balls.\n\nBut here's the thing: these ratios involve blue balls in both comparisons, which is helpful because we know exactly how many blue balls there are. So, we can use the number of blue balls to find the number of red and green balls.\n\nLet's start with the red balls. The ratio of red to blue balls is 3:2. This can be written as:\n\nred / blue = 3 / 2\n\nWe know there are 24 blue balls, so we can plug that in:\n\nred / 24 = 3 / 2\n\nTo find the number of red balls, we can solve for red:\n\nred = (3 / 2) * 24\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n3 divided by 2 is 1.5, and 1.5 multiplied by 24 is 36.\n\nSo, there are 36 red balls.\n\nNext, let's find the number of green balls using the ratio of blue to green balls, which is 4:5.\n\nThis can be written as:\n\nblue / green = 4 / 5\n\nAgain, we know there are 24 blue balls, so:\n\n24 / green = 4 / 5\n\nTo find green, we can cross-multiply:\n\n4 * green = 24 * 5\n\n4 * green = 120\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\ngreen = 120 / 4\n\ngreen = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 green balls.\n\nNow, to find the total number of balls in the box, we add up the red, blue, and green balls:\n\ntotal = red + blue + green\n\ntotal = 36 + 24 + 30\n\nLet's add those up:\n\n36 + 24 = 60\n\n60 + 30 = 90\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls in the box is 90.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the ratio of red to blue is 3:2. With 24 blue balls, calculating red balls:\n\nred = (3/2) * 24 = 36\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, the ratio of blue to green is 4:5. With 24 blue balls, calculating green balls:\n\n24 / green = 4 / 5\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n4 * green = 24 * 5\n\n4 * green = 120\n\ngreen = 120 / 4 = 30\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up: 36 red + 24 blue + 30 green = 90 balls in total.\n\nHmm, but I've heard of problems where the ratios need to be compatible, meaning they can be scaled to have the same number for the common term, which in this case is blue balls.\n\nLet me check if the ratios are consistent.\n\nWe have red:blue = 3:2 and blue:green = 4:5.\n\nTo combine these ratios, the blue part should be the same in both ratios.\n\nSo, let's find a common multiple for the blue part.\n\nIn the first ratio, blue is 2 parts, and in the second ratio, blue is 4 parts.\n\nThe least common multiple of 2 and 4 is 4.\n\nSo, we need to adjust the first ratio so that blue is 4 parts.\n\nThe first ratio is red:blue = 3:2.\n\nTo make blue 4, we multiply both parts by 2:\n\nred:blue = (3*2):(2*2) = 6:4\n\nNow, the second ratio is blue:green = 4:5.\n\nSo, combining them, red:blue:green = 6:4:5\n\nNow, if blue is 4 parts, and there are 24 blue balls, then each part is:\n\n24 / 4 = 6 balls per part\n\nTherefore:\n\nred = 6 parts * 6 = 36 balls\n\nblue = 4 parts * 6 = 24 balls\n\ngreen = 5 parts * 6 = 30 balls\n\nTotal = 36 + 24 + 30 = 90 balls\n\nThis matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the total number of balls in the box is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
