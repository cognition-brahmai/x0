        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"What is the sum of all the integers between 100 and 200 that are divisible by both 3 and 5?\" Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I need to find numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5. I remember that if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM). So, what's the LCM of 3 and 5?\n\nWell, 3 and 5 are both prime numbers, so their LCM is just their product: 3 times 5 is 15. So, I'm looking for numbers between 100 and 200 that are divisible by 15.\n\nNext, I need to find all the multiples of 15 in that range and then sum them up. To find the multiples of 15 between 100 and 200, I can start by finding the smallest multiple of 15 that is greater than or equal to 100, and the largest multiple of 15 that is less than or equal to 200.\n\nLet me find the smallest multiple of 15 greater than or equal to 100. I can do this by dividing 100 by 15 and then rounding up to the nearest whole number.\n\n100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666..., so rounding up, that's 7. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 in this range is 15 times 7, which is 105.\n\nNow, for the largest multiple of 15 less than or equal to 200, I can divide 200 by 15, which is approximately 13.333..., so rounding down, that's 13. Therefore, the largest multiple is 15 times 13, which is 195.\n\nSo, the multiples of 15 between 100 and 200 are: 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, and 195.\n\nNow, I need to sum these up. Let's add them step by step:\n\n105 + 120 = 225\n\n225 + 135 = 360\n\n360 + 150 = 510\n\n510 + 165 = 675\n\n675 + 180 = 855\n\n855 + 195 = 1050\n\nSo, the sum is 1050.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to do this without adding each number manually? I think there is. I recall that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:\n\nSum = (Number of terms) times (First term + Last term) divided by 2.\n\nYes, that should work here because the multiples of 15 form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 15.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the first term (a) is 105, the last term (l) is 195, and the common difference (d) is 15.\n\nTo find the number of terms (n), I can use the formula:\n\nn = (l - a)/d + 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nn = (195 - 105)/15 + 1 = 90/15 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 terms.\n\nNow, using the sum formula:\n\nSum = n times (a + l)/2 = 7 times (105 + 195)/2 = 7 times 300/2 = 7 times 150 = 1050\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by adding them manually.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe I can use the formula for the sum of multiples of a number within a range.\n\nI know that the sum of multiples of m from 1 to n is m times (floor(n/m) times (floor(n/m) + 1))/2.\n\nBut in this case, since I have a range from 100 to 200, and I'm dealing with multiples of 15, I might need to adjust that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the sum of multiples of 15 up to 200 minus the sum of multiples of 15 up to 100.\n\nWait, but that would include 105 up to 195, which is what I want.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, find the sum of multiples of 15 up to 200.\n\nFind how many multiples of 15 are there up to 200.\n\nFloor of 200 divided by 15 is 13, since 15 times 13 is 195, which is less than 200, and 15 times 14 is 210, which is greater than 200.\n\nSo, there are 13 multiples of 15 up to 200.\n\nTheir sum is 15 times (13 times 14)/2 = 15 times 91 = 1365\n\nNow, find the sum of multiples of 15 up to 100.\n\nFloor of 100 divided by 15 is 6, since 15 times 6 is 90, which is less than 100, and 15 times 7 is 105, which is greater than 100.\n\nSo, there are 6 multiples of 15 up to 100.\n\nTheir sum is 15 times (6 times 7)/2 = 15 times 21 = 315\n\nNow, subtract the sum up to 100 from the sum up to 200 to get the sum between 100 and 200.\n\n1365 - 315 = 1050\n\nAgain, I get 1050.\n\nSo, that's a good check.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nMaybe I can use the properties of arithmetic series directly.\n\nI have the first term a = 105, the last term l = 195, and the common difference d = 15.\n\nThe number of terms n = 7, as calculated before.\n\nSum = n times (a + l)/2 = 7 times (105 + 195)/2 = 7 times 300/2 = 7 times 150 = 1050\n\nYep, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = n/2 times (2a + (n-1)d)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSum = 7/2 times (2*105 + (7-1)*15) = 3.5 times (210 + 90) = 3.5 times 300 = 1050\n\nAgain, 1050.\n\nIt seems like no matter which method I use, I keep getting 1050.\n\nIs there any chance that this is incorrect?\n\nLet me list out the multiples of 15 between 100 and 200 once more to ensure I haven't missed any.\n\n15*7 = 105\n\n15*8 = 120\n\n15*9 = 135\n\n15*10 = 150\n\n15*11 = 165\n\n15*12 = 180\n\n15*13 = 195\n\nThat's seven terms, as previously determined.\n\nAdding them up: 105 + 120 = 225; 225 + 135 = 360; 360 + 150 = 510; 510 + 165 = 675; 675 + 180 = 855; 855 + 195 = 1050.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.\n\nThe average of 105 and 195 is (105 + 195)/2 = 300/2 = 150.\n\nMultiply by the number of terms, which is 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the sum is indeed 1050.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any numbers between 100 and 200 that are divisible by both 3 and 5 but aren't multiples of 15.\n\nI don't think so, because being divisible by both 3 and 5 should mean they're divisible by 15.\n\nIs there any exception to this?\n\nLet me think of a number that's divisible by both 3 and 5 but not by 15.\n\nWell, 30 is divisible by 3 and 5 and also by 15.\n\n45 is divisible by 3 and 5 and 15.\n\n60 is divisible by 3 and 5 and 15.\n\nI can't think of any number that's divisible by both 3 and 5 but not by 15.\n\nSo, I'm confident that considering multiples of 15 is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 1050.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1050} \\]"
