        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, so total balls are 5 + 3 = 8 balls.\n\nI need to draw two balls without replacement, and I want to find the probability that one is red and one is blue.\n\nFirst, I should think about how many ways I can draw two balls from eight. That's a combination problem, right? The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 8 is \"8 choose 2.\"\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(8, 2) = 8! / (2! * (8 - 2)!) = (8 * 7 * 6!) / (2 * 1 * 6!) = (8 * 7) / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28.\n\nSo, there are 28 possible ways to draw 2 balls from 8.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to draw one red and one blue ball.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red ball is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one blue ball is C(3, 1) = 3.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose one red and one blue is 5 * 3 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nProbability = 15 / 28.\n\nWait, but I should think about whether the order matters. Since it's without replacement and I'm drawing two balls at once, the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo, yeah, the probability should be 15/28.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 5/8.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of drawing a blue ball next is 3/7.\n\nSo, the probability of red then blue is (5/8) * (3/7) = 15/56.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing a blue ball first is 3/8.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was blue, the probability of drawing a red ball next is 5/7.\n\nSo, the probability of blue then red is (3/8) * (5/7) = 15/56.\n\nSince either order is acceptable (one red and one blue), I need to add these two probabilities together.\n\nSo, total probability = 15/56 + 15/56 = 30/56 = 15/28.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, the probability is 15/28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{28}} \\]"
