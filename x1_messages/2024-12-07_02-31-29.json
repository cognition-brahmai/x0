The city currently has 100 diesel buses, each with a fuel efficiency of 5 miles per gallon and an average daily mileage of 150 miles. The electric buses have a range of 200 miles on a single charge and cost $0.10 per mile to operate. Calculate the total annual operating cost for both types of buses, assuming that diesel costs $3.50 per gallon and electricity costs $0.12 per kWh. Also, estimate the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions if the city replaces half of its diesel buses with electric ones, considering that diesel emits 22.4 pounds of CO2 per gallon burned."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to calculate the total annual operating cost for both diesel and electric buses and then estimate the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions if the city replaces half of its diesel buses with electric ones.\n\nFirst, let's gather all the given data:\n\n- Current fleet: 100 diesel buses\n\n- Diesel bus fuel efficiency: 5 miles per gallon\n\n- Average daily mileage per bus: 150 miles\n\n- Electric bus range: 200 miles per charge\n\n- Operating cost for electric bus: $0.10 per mile\n\n- Cost of diesel: $3.50 per gallon\n\n- Cost of electricity: $0.12 per kWh\n\n- CO2 emissions from diesel: 22.4 pounds per gallon\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- We need to calculate annual operating costs, so we'll assume 365 days in a year.\n\n- For electric buses, the operating cost is given per mile, but we also have the cost per kWh. We might need to relate these, but let's see.\n\n- When replacing half the buses, that means replacing 50 diesel buses with 50 electric buses.\n\nLet's start by calculating the annual operating cost for the diesel buses.\n\n**Annual operating cost for diesel buses:**\n\n1. Calculate the daily fuel consumption per diesel bus:\n\nFuel consumption per day = (Daily mileage) / (Miles per gallon)\n\n= 150 miles / 5 mpg = 30 gallons per day per bus\n\n2. Calculate the daily fuel cost per diesel bus:\n\nDaily fuel cost = (Fuel consumption per day) * (Cost per gallon)\n\n= 30 gallons * $3.50/gallon = $105 per day per bus\n\n3. Calculate the annual fuel cost per diesel bus:\n\nAnnual fuel cost = Daily fuel cost * 365 days\n\n= $105 * 365 = $38,325 per bus per year\n\n4. For 100 diesel buses:\n\nTotal annual operating cost for diesel buses = 100 * $38,325 = $3,832,500\n\nNow, let's calculate the annual operating cost for electric buses.\n\n**Annual operating cost for electric buses:**\n\n1. Calculate the daily energy consumption per electric bus:\n\nSince the electric bus has a range of 200 miles per charge and the daily mileage is 150 miles, it doesn't need a full charge every day. However, for simplicity, let's assume it's charged fully each day.\n\nFirst, we need to find out the energy consumption per mile.\n\nGiven the operating cost is $0.10 per mile, and electricity costs $0.12 per kWh, we can find the energy consumption per mile.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nOperating cost per mile = (Energy consumption per mile) * (Cost per kWh)\n\nSo,\n\nEnergy consumption per mile = Operating cost per mile / Cost per kWh\n\n= $0.10 / $0.12 per kWh = 0.8333 kWh per mile\n\nTherefore, the electric bus consumes 0.8333 kWh per mile.\n\n2. Calculate the daily energy consumption per electric bus:\n\nDaily energy consumption = (Daily mileage) * (Energy consumption per mile)\n\n= 150 miles * 0.8333 kWh/mile = 125 kWh per day per bus\n\n3. Calculate the daily operating cost per electric bus:\n\nDaily operating cost = (Daily energy consumption) * (Cost per kWh)\n\n= 125 kWh * $0.12/kWh = $15 per day per bus\n\n4. Calculate the annual operating cost per electric bus:\n\nAnnual operating cost = Daily operating cost * 365 days\n\n= $15 * 365 = $5,475 per bus per year\n\nNow, if the city replaces half of its diesel buses with electric ones, that means replacing 50 diesel buses with 50 electric buses.\n\n**Total annual operating cost after replacement:**\n\n1. Operating cost for remaining 50 diesel buses:\n\n50 * $38,325 = $1,916,250\n\n2. Operating cost for 50 electric buses:\n\n50 * $5,475 = $273,750\n\n3. Total annual operating cost after replacement:\n\n$1,916,250 + $273,750 = $2,190,000\n\n**Reduction in annual operating cost:**\n\nOriginal total operating cost: $3,832,500\n\nNew total operating cost: $2,190,000\n\nReduction: $3,832,500 - $2,190,000 = $1,642,500\n\nNow, let's estimate the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Greenhouse gas emissions reduction:**\n\n1. Calculate the annual fuel consumption for one diesel bus:\n\nAnnual fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * 365\n\n= 30 gallons/day * 365 days = 10,950 gallons per year per bus\n\n2. Calculate the annual CO2 emissions for one diesel bus:\n\nAnnual CO2 emissions = Annual fuel consumption * Emissions per gallon\n\n= 10,950 gallons * 22.4 pounds/gallon = 245,280 pounds per year per bus\n\n3. For 50 diesel buses being replaced:\n\nTotal annual CO2 emissions from 50 diesel buses = 50 * 245,280 = 12,264,000 pounds\n\nSince electric buses do not emit CO2 during operation, the reduction in CO2 emissions would be equal to the emissions from the 50 diesel buses.\n\nTherefore, the estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is 12,264,000 pounds of CO2 per year.\n\n**Final Answers:**\n\n- Total annual operating cost for diesel buses: $3,832,500\n\n- Total annual operating cost for electric buses: $5,475 per bus, or $273,750 for 50 buses\n\n- Total annual operating cost after replacing half the buses: $2,190,000\n\n- Reduction in annual operating cost: $1,642,500\n\n- Estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: 12,264,000 pounds of CO2 per year\n\n**Note:** The calculation assumes that electric buses are charged daily, even if their range exceeds daily mileage, which might not be the case in practice. Additionally, other costs such as maintenance and depreciation are not considered here, focusing solely on fuel and energy costs."
