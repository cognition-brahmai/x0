        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 6 red balls and 4 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability that if I draw 2 balls without replacement, both of them are red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a ball, I don't put it back into the bag before drawing the next one. So, the total number of balls decreases with each draw, and the probabilities might change accordingly.\n\nNow, to find the probability that both balls are red, I can think about the problem in a few different ways. One common approach is to use the concept of conditional probability. That is, the probability of both events happening is the probability of the first event happening multiplied by the probability of the second event happening given that the first one has already happened.\n\nSo, in this case, the first event is drawing a red ball on the first draw, and the second event is drawing another red ball on the second draw, given that the first one was red.\n\nLet me calculate the probability of the first event. There are 6 red balls out of a total of 10 balls, so the probability of drawing a red ball first is 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nNow, given that the first ball drawn was red, there are now 5 red balls left and a total of 9 balls remaining in the bag. So, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 5/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening, that is, both balls being red, is (3/5) multiplied by (5/9). Let's calculate that:\n\n(3/5) * (5/9) = (3 * 5) / (5 * 9) = 15 / 45 = 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations. When multiplying fractions, I multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So, 3 times 5 is 15, and 5 times 9 is 45. Simplifying 15/45 gives me 1/3. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to use combinations. Since the order in which I draw the balls doesn't matter (I just care about both being red), I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 6 is given by the combination formula C(6,2), which is 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 2 balls out of 10 is C(10,2), which is 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 15/45 = 1/3.\n\nHmm, interesting. Both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like whether I use conditional probability or combinations, the probability that both balls are red is 1/3.\n\nLet me just make sure I haven't missed anything. Is there another way to look at this problem? Maybe using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf I consider the order of drawing the balls, then for the first draw, there are 6 red balls out of 10, so the probability is 6/10. For the second draw, assuming the first was red, there are 5 red balls left out of 9 total balls, so 5/9. Multiplying them gives me again 6/10 * 5/9 = 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the order mattering, the total number of ways to draw 2 balls in order is 10 options for the first draw and 9 for the second, so 10*9=90 possible ordered pairs.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 red balls in order is 6 options for the first draw and 5 for the second, so 6*5=30.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 30/90=1/3 again.\n\nIt seems no matter how I approach this, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 1/3 is indeed the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like replacement or anything else, but the problem specifically says \"without replacement,\" so I don't need to consider that.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the balls are indistinguishable except for their color, which seems to be the case here. There's no mention of any other characteristics or patterns, so I can treat them solely based on their color.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the draws are independent or not. In this case, since it's without replacement, the draws are dependent because the outcome of the first draw affects the probabilities of the second draw. That's why I used conditional probability.\n\nBut as I saw, using both conditional probability and combinations gives me the same answer, which reinforces that 1/3 is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The probability that both balls drawn are red is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
