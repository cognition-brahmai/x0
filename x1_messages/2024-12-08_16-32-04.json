        "content": "So I've got this game here, and I need to figure out what the expected value is if I play it once. Let me see... There are three possible outcomes, each with a one-third chance of happening.\n\nFirst, there's a 1/3 chance that I win $100. That sounds pretty good. Then, there's another 1/3 chance that I lose $50. Hmm, that's not so great. And finally, there's a 1/3 chance that I break even, which means neither winning nor losing any money.\n\nOkay, so to find the expected value, I need to consider each possible outcome, multiply it by its probability, and then add all those up. That's the formula for expected value in probability.\n\nSo, let's list out the outcomes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Winning $100 with a probability of 1/3.\n\n2. Losing $50 with a probability of 1/3.\n\n3. Breaking even (which is $0) with a probability of 1/3.\n\nNow, the expected value (EV) would be:\n\nEV = (probability of winning * amount won) + (probability of losing * amount lost) + (probability of breaking even * amount gained from breaking even)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nEV = (1/3 * $100) + (1/3 * (-$50)) + (1/3 * $0)\n\nWait, losing money should be a negative amount, right? Yeah, because it's money going out.\n\nSo, calculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/3 * $100 = $33.33 (repeating)\n\nSecond term: 1/3 * (-$50) = -$16.67 (repeating)\n\nThird term: 1/3 * $0 = $0\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n$33.33 + (-$16.67) + $0 = $33.33 - $16.67 = $16.66\n\nWait, actually, $33.33 minus $16.67 is $16.66, but since it's repeating decimals, it's exactly $16.666...\n\nBut in finance, we usually round to two decimal places, so it would be $16.67.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in fractions to avoid decimals.\n\nLet me do it again with fractions.\n\nEV = (1/3 * 100) + (1/3 * (-50)) + (1/3 * 0)\n\n= (100/3) + (-50/3) + 0\n\n= (100 - 50)/3\n\n= 50/3\n\nWhich is approximately 16.67.\n\nSo, the expected value is $16.67.\n\nBut to be precise, it's 50/3 dollars, which is approximately $16.67.\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, you can't have a fraction of a cent, but in theoretical calculations, it's fine to have it.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as 50/3, but most people prefer decimals.\n\nSo, the expected value is approximately $16.67 if you play this game once.\n\nInterestingly, even though there's a chance of losing money, the positive outcome is high enough that the expected value is still positive.\n\nThis means, on average, if you played this game many times, you'd expect to gain about $16.67 per game.\n\nBut of course, in a single play, you'll either win $100, lose $50, or break even.\n\nIt's just that, over many plays, the average outcome would be around $16.67 per game.\n\nThis concept is really important in decision making under uncertainty, like in gambling, investments, and other risky endeavors.\n\nIt helps to quantify the average outcome you can expect, given the probabilities of different results.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the expected value of playing this game once is approximately $16.67.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16.67} \\]"
