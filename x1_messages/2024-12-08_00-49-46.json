        "content": "So there are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 10 balls. You're going to draw one ball, look at its color, put it back in the bag, and then draw another ball. You want to know the probability that both balls you draw are red.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw. Since there are 4 red balls out of 10 total balls, the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, because you're putting the first ball back into the bag before drawing the second ball, the total number of balls remains the same, and the probabilities don't change. So, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is also 2/5.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together\u2014that is, drawing a red ball on the first draw AND drawing a red ball on the second draw\u2014we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red balls in a row is (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 4/25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}} \\]\n"
