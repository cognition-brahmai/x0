This tool is useful in finding an appropriate list of sites that may or may not include the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nNLPModel[input]: Natural Language Processing model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the architect behind the Sydney Opera House and what other famous buildings did they design?"

        "content": "Alright, I've got this question: \"Who was the architect behind the Sydney Opera House and what other famous buildings did they design?\" Okay, so I need to find out who designed the Sydney Opera House and then find out what other famous buildings this architect designed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who the architect is. I know that the Sydney Opera House is a famous building, so probably the architect is also well-known. But just to be sure, I should look it up. I can use the Bing search engine for this. So, I'll search for \"architect of Sydney Opera House.\"\n\nOnce I have the name of the architect, I need to find out other famous buildings designed by them. So, after getting the architect's name from the search, I can use that name to search for their other works. Maybe I can search for something like \"[architect's name] famous buildings\" or \"[architect's name] architecture works.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe on the search results for the architect, there's already information about their other works. So, I should check the search results carefully.\n\nI also have a tool called WebScraper, which can scrape the content from websites. If I find some websites that have information about the architect and their works, I can use WebScraper to get the text from those pages. Then, I can use the NLPModel to extract the specific information I need from that text.\n\nAlso, there's a LinkExtractor tool that can extract links from text. Maybe I can use that to find more relevant pages from the search results.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst step: Use Bing to search for \"architect of Sydney Opera House.\"\n\nOnce I have the search results, I can look for the name of the architect. Probably, it's J\u00f8rn Utzon, but I should confirm that.\n\nSecond step: Once I have the architect's name, I can use Bing again to search for \"[architect's name] famous buildings\" or \"[architect's name] architecture works.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a Wikipedia page or an official website that lists all their works. I can look for that.\n\nThird step: If I find some websites with information about the architect's works, I can use WebScraper to extract the text from those pages.\n\nFourth step: Then, I can use the NLPModel to analyze that text and find out what other famous buildings the architect designed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can directly use the NLPModel on the search results to extract the information, but I think it's better to scrape the relevant pages first to get more comprehensive information.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the information I'm getting is accurate and from reliable sources. So, preferring websites like Wikipedia, official architecture websites, or reputable news sources would be good.\n\nLet me outline this plan:\n\nPlan: Search for the architect of the Sydney Opera House using Bing.\n\n:evidence0: = Bing[\"architect of Sydney Opera House\"]\n\nPlan: Extract the name of the architect from the search results.\n\n:evidence1: = NLPModel[\"Who was the architect of the Sydney Opera House? Given :evidence0:\"]\n\nPlan: Search for famous buildings designed by the architect.\n\n:evidence2: = Bing[:evidence1: + \" famous buildings\"]\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the search results for more information.\n\n:evidence3: = LinkExtractor[:evidence2:]\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from the relevant links.\n\n:evidence4: = WebScraper[:evidence3:]\n\nPlan: Use the NLPModel to find other famous buildings designed by the architect from the scraped text.\n\n:evidence5: = NLPModel[\"What are some famous buildings designed by \" + :evidence1: + \"? Given :evidence4:\"]\n\nAnswer: :evidence5:\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll perform the Bing search for \"architect of Sydney Opera House.\"\n\n**Step 1: Search for the architect of the Sydney Opera House.**\n\n:evidence0: = Bing[\"architect of Sydney Opera House\"]\n\nAssuming this returns search results including the name J\u00f8rn Utzon as the architect.\n\n**Step 2: Extract the architect's name from the search results.**\n\n:evidence1: = NLPModel[\"Who was the architect of the Sydney Opera House? Given :evidence0:\"]\n\nThis should return \"J\u00f8rn Utzon.\"\n\n**Step 3: Search for famous buildings designed by J\u00f8rn Utzon.**\n\n:evidence2: = Bing[:evidence1: + \" famous buildings\"]\n\nThis would be \"J\u00f8rn Utzon famous buildings.\"\n\nAssuming this returns search results with links to pages listing Utzon's works.\n\n**Step 4: Extract relevant links from the search results.**\n\n:evidence3: = LinkExtractor[:evidence2:]\n\nThis will give a list of links related to J\u00f8rn Utzon's famous buildings.\n\n**Step 5: Scrape the content from these links.**\n\n:evidence4: = WebScraper[:evidence3:]\n\nThis will produce plain text content from the selected pages.\n\n**Step 6: Use the NLPModel to identify and list other famous buildings designed by J\u00f8rn Utzon.**\n\n:evidence5: = NLPModel[\"What are some famous buildings designed by J\u00f8rn Utzon? Given :evidence4:\"]\n\nThis should provide a list of famous buildings designed by Utzon, such as the Bagsv\u00e6rd Church, Kurashiki Yanamura Blanka Library, etc.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n:evidence5:\n\nThis plan ensures that I systematically find and verify the information required to answer the question comprehensively."
