        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a train goes from Town A to Town B in 5 hours, and the distance is 300 miles. If the train speeds up by 20 mph, how long will it take to cover the same distance?\n\nFirst, I need to find out the train's original speed. Since it covers 300 miles in 5 hours, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nSo, the original speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{original speed} = \\frac{300 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 60 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nNow, if the train increases its speed by 20 mph, the new speed will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{new speed} = 60 \\text{ mph} + 20 \\text{ mph} = 80 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nNext, I need to find out how long it will take to travel 300 miles at this new speed. Again, using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{new time} = \\frac{300 \\text{ miles}}{80 \\text{ mph}} = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, it will take 3.75 hours to travel the same distance at the increased speed.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, original speed:\n\n\\[ \\frac{300}{5} = 60 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, new speed:\n\n\\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nAlright.\n\nNow, new time:\n\n\\[ \\frac{300}{80} = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of proportions. If the speed increases, the time decreases proportionally.\n\nLet me see, the original speed is 60 mph, and the new speed is 80 mph. The ratio of the speeds is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{80}{60} = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\nSince time is inversely proportional to speed when distance is constant, the new time should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{new time} = \\text{original time} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 5 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nAnd since the speed increases by 20 mph, the new speed is 80 mph, and the time is 300 divided by 80, which is 3.75 hours.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the train's speed is constantly increasing or if it's just a sudden increase by 20 mph.\n\nBut the problem says the train increases its speed by 20 mph, so I think it's safe to assume that the new speed is a constant 80 mph.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the concept of average speed. If the train maintains a constant speed of 80 mph, the time to cover 300 miles is indeed 3.75 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like acceleration or anything, but the problem seems to be straightforward, assuming constant speeds.\n\nSo, I believe 3.75 hours is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the units. The distance is in miles, and the speeds are in miles per hour, so the time should be in hours. 3.75 hours is equivalent to 3 hours and 45 minutes, if needed.\n\nAlso, I can check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using equations of motion, but since it's a constant speed and no acceleration is mentioned, the simple formula should suffice.\n\nLet me try to set up an equation to confirm.\n\nLet \\( v \\) be the original speed, \\( t \\) be the original time, and \\( d \\) be the distance.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{d}{t} = \\frac{300}{5} = 60 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nNew speed:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{new}} = v + 20 = 80 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nNew time:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{d}{v_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{300}{80} = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for time difference or something, but it's not necessary since the direct approach gives a clear answer.\n\nI can also think about it in terms of percentages. The speed increases by 20 mph from 60 mph, which is a \\( \\frac{20}{60} = \\overline{3}\\% \\) increase.\n\nSince time is inversely proportional, the time should decrease by approximately \\( \\overline{3}\\% \\).\n\nOriginal time is 5 hours. Decrease by \\( \\overline{3}\\% \\):\n\n\\[ 5 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{20}{60}\\right) = 5 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 5 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.333 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't match my previous result. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I messed up here. The percentage increase in speed is \\( \\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3} \\) or approximately 33.33%, not \\( \\overline{3}\\% \\).\n\nSo, if the speed increases by 33.33%, the time should decrease by the ratio \\( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nTherefore, new time is \\( 5 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 3.75 \\) hours.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the percentage method also confirms that the new time is 3.75 hours.\n\nI think I got it right now.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's imagine actually driving at 80 mph for 3.75 hours and see if it covers 300 miles.\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 3.75 = 80 \\times \\left(4 - 0.25\\right) = 80 \\times 4 - 80 \\times 0.25 = 320 - 20 = 300 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nPerfect, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the original scenario: 60 mph for 5 hours is indeed 300 miles.\n\nIncreasing speed to 80 mph, and calculating time as 300 divided by 80 gives 3.75 hours, which aligns with everything I've calculated.\n\nI think I've covered all angles here and can confidently say that the answer is 3.75 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.75 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
