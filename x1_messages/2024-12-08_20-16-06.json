        "content": "So the supermarket chain wants to open 50 new stores over the next three years. Each store costs $2 million to build and equip, and then there are ongoing operating expenses of $500,000 per store per year. They want to know the total investment required for this expansion and what their annual revenue needs to be to achieve a 15% return on investment.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total initial investment for constructing and equipping all 50 stores. Since each store costs $2 million, we can multiply that by the number of stores:\n\nTotal initial investment = 50 stores * $2,000,000/store = $100,000,000\n\nNext, we need to account for the ongoing operating expenses. These are estimated at $500,000 per store per year. Since there are 50 stores, the total annual operating expense would be:\n\nTotal annual operating expense = 50 stores * $500,000/store/year = $25,000,000/year\n\nNow, the expansion is planned over three years. So, the total operating expenses over the three years would be:\n\nTotal operating expenses over three years = $25,000,000/year * 3 years = $75,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total investment required for the expansion would be the sum of the initial investment and the total operating expenses over the three years:\n\nTotal investment = $100,000,000 + $75,000,000 = $175,000,000\n\nNow, to determine the expected annual revenue needed to achieve a 15% return on investment (ROI), we need to calculate 15% of the total investment and then figure out what annual revenue would cover both the operating expenses and provide that return.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the desired return:\n\nDesired return = 15% of $175,000,000 = 0.15 * $175,000,000 = $26,250,000\n\nThis means that the supermarket chain wants to earn an additional $26,250,000 on top of covering their operating expenses each year.\n\nSo, the total annual revenue needed would be the sum of the annual operating expenses and the desired return:\n\nTotal annual revenue needed = $25,000,000 (operating expenses) + $26,250,000 (desired return) = $51,250,000\n\nTherefore, the supermarket chain needs to generate at least $51,250,000 in annual revenue from the new stores to achieve a 15% return on their total investment over three years.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The total investment is $175 million, which includes both the initial construction costs and the operating expenses over three years. But typically, when calculating ROI, we consider the initial investment and the returns generated from it, including both the recovery of the initial investment and the profit.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the initial investment as $100 million for construction and equipment, and then the operating expenses as ongoing costs.\n\nIn this case, the total investment would be the initial $100 million plus the operating expenses over the three years, which is $75 million, totaling $175 million, as I calculated before.\n\nNow, to achieve a 15% return on this $175 million investment, the supermarket chain would need to earn $26.25 million per year in profit, as I calculated earlier.\n\nHowever, they also need to cover their operating expenses of $25 million per year. So, the total annual revenue required would be the sum of the operating expenses and the desired profit:\n\nAnnual revenue needed = Operating expenses + Desired profit = $25,000,000 + $26,250,000 = $51,250,000\n\nThis seems consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider the total cash outflow and the total cash inflow over the three years.\n\nTotal cash outflow:\n\n- Initial investment: $100 million\n\n- Operating expenses over three years: $25 million/year * 3 years = $75 million\n\nTotal cash outflow = $100 million + $75 million = $175 million\n\nNow, to achieve a 15% return on the $175 million investment over three years, we can calculate the total required cash inflow.\n\nFirst, find the total desired return:\n\nTotal desired return = 15% * $175 million = $26.25 million per year * 3 years = $78.75 million\n\nWait, no. Actually, a 15% return on investment typically means a 15% annual return. So, if they invest $175 million over three years, they would want to earn 15% each year on their investment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the payback period or the internal rate of return, but the question specifies a 15% return on investment.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total investment and the total revenue required over the three years to achieve a 15% return, and then find the annual revenue by dividing by three.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTotal investment is $175 million.\n\nDesired return is 15% per year.\n\nOver three years, the total desired return would be:\n\nTotal desired return = $175 million * 15% * 3 years = $175 million * 0.15 * 3 = $78.75 million\n\nTherefore, the total revenue needed over three years is the total investment plus the total desired return:\n\nTotal revenue needed over three years = $175 million + $78.75 million = $253.75 million\n\nThen, the annual revenue needed would be:\n\nAnnual revenue needed = $253.75 million / 3 years \u2248 $84.5833 million per year\n\nHmm, this differs from my earlier calculation of $51.25 million per year.\n\nWhich approach is correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe initial investment is $100 million for construction and equipment, and then $25 million per year in operating expenses for three years.\n\nSo, the total investment is $100 million + $25 million * 3 = $175 million.\n\nNow, to achieve a 15% annual return on this investment, we need to earn 15% per year on the invested amount.\n\nBut the operating expenses are ongoing costs that need to be covered each year, in addition to the desired return.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to consider the initial investment and the desired return separately from the operating expenses.\n\nLet's consider that the initial investment is $100 million, and the operating expenses are $25 million per year.\n\nThe desired return is 15% per year on the initial investment, which is $100 million * 15% = $15 million per year.\n\nTherefore, the total annual revenue needed would be the operating expenses plus the desired return:\n\nAnnual revenue needed = $25 million (operating expenses) + $15 million (desired return) = $40 million per year\n\nWait, now I have a different number again.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to clarify what is meant by \"return on investment.\"\n\nReturn on investment (ROI) is generally calculated as (Net Profit / Total Investment) * 100%.\n\nIn this case, the total investment is $175 million, as calculated earlier.\n\nIf they want a 15% ROI, that means they want a net profit of 15% of $175 million, which is $26.25 million per year, as I calculated initially.\n\nBut if they need to cover $25 million in operating expenses each year, then the total annual revenue needed would be $25 million + $26.25 million = $51.25 million, which aligns with my first calculation.\n\nHowever, in the second approach, I considered the total investment plus the desired return over three years, and then divided by three to get the annual revenue, which gave me $84.5833 million per year.\n\nThat doesn't make sense because that seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the operating expenses are already included in the total investment, so they shouldn't be added again in the revenue calculation.\n\nWait, no, operating expenses are ongoing costs that need to be covered each year, separate from the initial investment.\n\nThe initial investment is for construction and equipment, which is a one-time cost, and then there are annual operating expenses.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to treat the initial investment separately from the annual operating expenses.\n\nLet's try to calculate the total cash flow over three years.\n\nInitial outlay: $100 million\n\nAnnual operating expenses: $25 million per year for three years: $75 million\n\nTotal cash outflow: $100 million + $75 million = $175 million\n\nNow, they want a 15% return on this $175 million investment over three years.\n\nSo, the total desired return is 15% of $175 million = $26.25 million per year * 3 years = $78.75 million\n\nTherefore, the total revenue needed over three years is the total cash outflow plus the desired return: $175 million + $78.75 million = $253.75 million\n\nThen, the annual revenue needed would be $253.75 million / 3 years \u2248 $84.5833 million per year\n\nBut earlier, I thought it should be $51.25 million per year.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me check another way.\n\nIf the initial investment is $100 million and the annual operating expenses are $25 million, and they want a 15% return on the initial investment, then:\n\nDesired annual return = 15% of $100 million = $15 million per year\n\nTherefore, total annual revenue needed = operating expenses + desired return = $25 million + $15 million = $40 million per year\n\nBut this seems too low compared to the earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the return should be calculated on the total investment, which is $175 million, so:\n\nDesired annual return = 15% of $175 million = $26.25 million per year\n\nThen, total annual revenue needed = operating expenses + desired return = $25 million + $26.25 million = $51.25 million per year\n\nThis seems more consistent.\n\nBut wait, if the total investment is $175 million and they want a 15% return on that, which is $26.25 million per year, but this is over three years, so perhaps the total desired return over three years is $26.25 million * 3 = $78.75 million, and the total revenue needed over three years is $175 million (investment) + $78.75 million (return) = $253.75 million, which would be approximately $84.5833 million per year.\n\nBut according to this, it's $84.5833 million per year, whereas earlier I had $51.25 million per year.\n\nI think there's a confusion here about how to calculate the return on investment.\n\nMaybe I should look up the formula for return on investment and how it's applied in this context.\n\nOkay, ROI is typically calculated as (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100%\n\nIn this case, the cost of investment is the initial investment plus the operating expenses over the three years, which is $175 million.\n\nThey want a 15% ROI, which means they want net profit to be 15% of $175 million, which is $26.25 million per year.\n\nBut actually, since the investment is spread over three years, perhaps the ROI should be calculated on an annual basis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the present value of the cash flows to determine the required annual revenue.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should simplify it.\n\nLet's assume that the total investment is $175 million, and they want a 15% return on this investment over three years.\n\nIf we consider the return to be compounded annually, then the future value of the investment would be:\n\nFuture Value = Initial Investment * (1 + ROI)^Number of Years\n\nBut in this case, since there are ongoing expenses, it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the total required return over three years and add it to the total investment to find the total revenue needed.\n\nTotal required return = 15% of $175 million = $26.25 million per year * 3 years = $78.75 million\n\nTotal revenue needed over three years = $175 million + $78.75 million = $253.75 million\n\nAnnual revenue needed = $253.75 million / 3 years \u2248 $84.5833 million per year\n\nBut earlier, I had $51.25 million per year, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the ROI is calculated on the initial investment only or on the total investment including operating expenses.\n\nIf ROI is based on the initial investment of $100 million, then:\n\nDesired annual return = 15% of $100 million = $15 million per year\n\nTotal annual revenue needed = operating expenses + desired return = $25 million + $15 million = $40 million per year\n\nBut this seems too low, as it doesn't account for the operating expenses being covered by the revenue and still achieving the desired return on the initial investment.\n\nAlternatively, if ROI is based on the total investment of $175 million, then:\n\nDesired annual return = 15% of $175 million = $26.25 million per year\n\nTotal annual revenue needed = operating expenses + desired return = $25 million + $26.25 million = $51.25 million per year\n\nThis seems more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, considering the total investment of $175 million and wanting a 15% return over three years, perhaps the desired total return is $26.25 million per year for three years, totaling $78.75 million, and thus the total revenue needed over three years is $175 million + $78.75 million = $253.75 million, which is approximately $84.5833 million per year.\n\nBut this seems higher than the previous calculation.\n\nI think the discrepancy lies in whether the ROI is applied to the initial investment only or to the total investment including operating expenses.\n\nGiven that the operating expenses are ongoing costs that need to be covered each year, perhaps the ROI should only be applied to the initial investment, and the operating expenses are separate.\n\nIn that case, the annual revenue needed would be $40 million per year.\n\nBut intuitively, that seems too low, as the operating expenses are already higher than that.\n\nWait, no, the operating expenses are $25 million per year, so if the revenue is $40 million per year, then the profit would be $40 million - $25 million = $15 million per year, which is exactly the desired return on the initial investment of $100 million.\n\nSo, in that sense, it makes sense.\n\nHowever, if we consider the total investment including operating expenses, which is $175 million, and want a 15% return on that, then the desired return would be $26.25 million per year, leading to a required annual revenue of $51.25 million.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent because the operating expenses are already included in the total investment.\n\nI think the correct approach is to consider the initial investment separately from the operating expenses.\n\nThe initial investment is $100 million, and the operating expenses are $25 million per year.\n\nThe desired return is 15% per year on the initial investment, which is $15 million per year.\n\nTherefore, the total annual revenue needed is the sum of the operating expenses and the desired return: $25 million + $15 million = $40 million per year.\n\nThis seems logical because the revenue needs to cover both the operating expenses and provide the desired return on the initial investment.\n\nThe other approach, considering the total investment of $175 million and wanting a 15% return on that, seems incorrect because the operating expenses are ongoing costs that are already factored into the annual revenue requirement.\n\nTherefore, the correct annual revenue needed is $40 million per year.\n\nWait, but the operating expenses are $25 million per year, and the desired return is $15 million per year, so total revenue needed is $40 million per year.\n\nHowever, over three years, the total revenue would be $120 million, the total operating expenses would be $75 million, and the profit would be $45 million.\n\nThe initial investment was $100 million, and the profit over three years is $45 million, which is 45% of $100 million, or 15% per year, which matches the desired ROI.\n\nTherefore, the required annual revenue is $40 million per year.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nTotal initial investment: $100 million\n\nAnnual operating expenses: $25 million\n\nDesired annual return: 15% of $100 million = $15 million\n\nTotal annual revenue needed: $25 million + $15 million = $40 million per year\n\nOver three years, total revenue: $40 million/year * 3 years = $120 million\n\nTotal operating expenses over three years: $25 million/year * 3 years = $75 million\n\nTotal profit over three years: $120 million - $75 million = $45 million\n\nROI: ($45 million / $100 million) * 100% = 45% over three years, which is 15% per year.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the supermarket chain needs to generate at least $40 million in annual revenue from the new stores to achieve a 15% return on their initial investment of $100 million, while also covering their annual operating expenses of $25 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ million dollars per year}} \\]"
