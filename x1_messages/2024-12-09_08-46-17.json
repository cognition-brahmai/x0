        "content": "Let's see. Three friends bought a chocolate bar for $6 and decided to split the cost evenly. So initially, each would pay $2, right? Because $6 divided by 3 is $2.\n\nBut then, the cashier gave them back $1 due to a discount. So the total amount they actually paid is $6 minus $1, which is $5.\n\nNow, they need to split this $5 among the three friends evenly. So, each friend should pay $5 divided by 3, which is approximately $1.666...\n\nBut money is usually dealt in dollars and cents, so $1.666... is $1 and 66 cents, but since we can't pay in fractions of a cent, it's $1.67 per person.\n\nWait, but $1.67 times 3 is $5.01, which is 1 cent more than the total amount paid. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two friends pay $1.67 and one pays $1.66. Let's check: $1.67 + $1.67 + $1.66 = $5.00 exactly.\n\nYes, that works. So, two friends pay $1.67 and one pays $1.66.\n\nBut is there a better way to distribute the payment so that it's fair?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can each pay $1.66, which totals $4.98, and then somehow deal with the remaining 2 cents.\n\nBut that doesn't seem fair because the total is $5, and $4.98 is 2 cents short.\n\nWait, perhaps they can each pay $1.66 and then decide what to do with the extra 2 cents.\n\nBut that might not be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can each pay $1.67 and one of them gets the extra cent back.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to have two friends pay $1.67 and one pay $1.66, as I thought earlier.\n\nThis way, the total is exactly $5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe they can each pay $1.50, which totals $4.50, and then somehow deal with the remaining $0.50.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because $4.50 is less than $5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can each pay $1.66 and consider the extra cent as a rounding error.\n\nBut that still leaves 2 cents unaccounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps the store keeps the extra cent as part of the discount.\n\nBut that might not be fair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the discount was already applied to the $6, making it $5, and they need to split $5 among three people.\n\nIn that case, each person pays $5 divided by 3, which is approximately $1.666...\n\nIn decimal form, that's $1.666..., but in practice, it's $1.67 per person, with a total of $5.01, which is 1 cent more.\n\nBut that extra cent doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one person pays $1.67 and the other two pay $1.66 each.\n\nLet's check: $1.67 + $1.66 + $1.66 = $5.00 exactly.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, to make it fair, one friend can pay $1.67 and the other two can pay $1.66.\n\nAlternatively, they can rotate who pays the extra cent each time they buy something together.\n\nThat seems fair.\n\nAlternatively, they can each pay $1.67 and agree to deal with the extra cent another way.\n\nBut that might lead to confusion.\n\nI think the best approach is to have two friends pay $1.66 and one pay $1.67, as that adds up exactly to $5.\n\nSo, each friend should pay either $1.66 or $1.67, depending on how they decide to split the exact amount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.67 \\text{ for one friend and } 1.66 \\text{ for each of the other two friends}} \\]"
