        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a group of 9 men and 6 women, and we need to form a committee of 5 people. The question is asking for the probability that the committee will have at least 3 women. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least 3 women\" means in this context. It means that the committee can have 3 women, 4 women, or 5 women. So, I need to find the probability of each of these scenarios and then add them up.\n\nBut before I dive into that, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. I recall that in probability, especially with combinations, it's often easier to calculate the complement of what you're looking for and then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.\n\nSo, the complement of having at least 3 women would be having fewer than 3 women, which means having 0, 1, or 2 women in the committee.\n\nHmm, but the problem specifically asks for at least 3 women, so maybe it's simpler to calculate that directly.\n\nLet me think about the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 people from 15 individuals (9 men + 6 women). That would be the combination of 15 choose 5, which is written as C(15,5).\n\nNow, the number of ways to have exactly 3 women in the committee would be the number of ways to choose 3 women from 6 multiplied by the number of ways to choose 2 men from 9, because the rest of the committee members would be men.\n\nSimilarly, for exactly 4 women, it's C(6,4) times C(9,1), and for exactly 5 women, it's C(6,5) times C(9,0).\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is C(6,3)*C(9,2) + C(6,4)*C(9,1) + C(6,5)*C(9,0).\n\nThen, the probability would be this sum divided by the total number of possible committees, which is C(15,5).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nProbability = [C(6,3)*C(9,2) + C(6,4)*C(9,1) + C(6,5)*C(9,0)] / C(15,5)\n\nNow, I need to calculate these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(6,3) is (6!)/(3!*(6-3)!) = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20\n\nC(9,2) is (9!)/(2!*(9-2)!) = (9*8)/(2*1) = 36\n\nSo, C(6,3)*C(9,2) = 20*36 = 720\n\nNext, C(6,4) is (6!)/(4!*(6-4)!) = (6*5*4*3)/(4*3*2*1) = 15\n\nC(9,1) is 9\n\nSo, C(6,4)*C(9,1) = 15*9 = 135\n\nThen, C(6,5) is (6!)/(5!*(6-5)!) = 6\n\nC(9,0) is 1\n\nSo, C(6,5)*C(9,0) = 6*1 = 6\n\nNow, summing these up: 720 + 135 + 6 = 861\n\nNow, C(15,5) is (15!)/(5!*(15-5)!) = (15*14*13*12*11)/(5*4*3*2*1) = 3003\n\nTherefore, the probability is 861 / 3003.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 21.\n\n861 \u00f7 21 = 41\n\n3003 \u00f7 21 = 143\n\nSo, 41/143.\n\nWait, but I'm used to seeing probabilities as decimals or percentages. Maybe I should convert this to a decimal.\n\n41 divided by 143 is approximately 0.2867.\n\nSo, the probability is roughly 0.2867, or 28.67%.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, C(6,3) = 20, C(9,2) = 36, product is 720.\n\nC(6,4) = 15, C(9,1) = 9, product is 135.\n\nC(6,5) = 6, C(9,0) = 1, product is 6.\n\nSum is indeed 720 + 135 + 6 = 861.\n\nC(15,5) = 3003.\n\n861 / 3003 = 41/143 \u2248 0.2867.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the complement approach to verify.\n\nThe complement of at least 3 women is having 0, 1, or 2 women.\n\nSo, Probability(complement) = [C(6,0)*C(9,5) + C(6,1)*C(9,4) + C(6,2)*C(9,3)] / C(15,5)\n\nLet's calculate each term.\n\nC(6,0) = 1\n\nC(9,5) = (9!)/(5!*(9-5)!) = (9*8*7*6*5)/(5*4*3*2*1) = 126\n\nC(6,1) = 6\n\nC(9,4) = (9!)/(4!*(9-4)!) = (9*8*7*6)/(4*3*2*1) = 126\n\nC(6,2) = (6!)/(2!*(6-2)!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15\n\nC(9,3) = (9!)/(3!*(9-3)!) = (9*8*7)/(3*2*1) = 84\n\nNow, products:\n\nC(6,0)*C(9,5) = 1*126 = 126\n\nC(6,1)*C(9,4) = 6*126 = 756\n\nC(6,2)*C(9,3) = 15*84 = 1260\n\nSum is 126 + 756 + 1260 = 2142\n\nSo, Probability(complement) = 2142 / 3003\n\nNow, Probability(at least 3 women) = 1 - Probability(complement) = 1 - (2142 / 3003) = (3003 - 2142) / 3003 = 861 / 3003\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, so it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to use the hypergeometric distribution formula here, but since I've already got the answer through combinations, maybe I don't need to go there.\n\nBut for completeness, the hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = [C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (15 people)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (6 women)\n\n- n is the number of draws (5 committee members)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (3, 4, or 5 women)\n\nSo, P(X>=3) = P(X=3) + P(X=4) + P(X=5)\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nP(X>=3) = sum from k=3 to 5 of [C(6, k) * C(9, 5-k)] / C(15,5)\n\nWhich again matches my initial approach.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 41/143 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to express it as a decimal, it's approximately 0.2867, or 28.67%.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify the format, I can leave it as a fraction.\n\nSo, the probability that the committee will have at least 3 women is 41/143.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{41}{143}} \\]"
