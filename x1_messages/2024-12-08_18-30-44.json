        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that makes two types of widgets: small and large. Each small widget weighs 5 pounds, and each large one weighs 10 pounds. On Monday, they produced a total of 100 widgets that weigh 750 pounds altogether. We need to figure out how many of each type they made.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( s \\) be the number of small widgets.\n\n- Let \\( l \\) be the number of large widgets.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of widgets is 100.\n\n2. The total weight of the widgets is 750 pounds.\n\nSo, I can write two equations corresponding to these two pieces of information.\n\nThe first equation is about the total number of widgets:\n\n\\[ s + l = 100 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total weight:\n\n\\[ 5s + 10l = 750 \\]\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I need to solve for \\( s \\) and \\( l \\).\n\nOne way to solve this system is by using the substitution method. I can solve one of the equations for one variable and then substitute that expression into the other equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = 100 - l \\]\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for \\( s \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 5(100 - l) + 10l = 750 \\]\n\nLet me simplify and solve for \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 500 - 5l + 10l = 750 \\]\n\n\\[ 500 + 5l = 750 \\]\n\n\\[ 5l = 750 - 500 \\]\n\n\\[ 5l = 250 \\]\n\n\\[ l = 50 \\]\n\nSo, there are 50 large widgets.\n\nNow, I can plug this value back into the expression for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = 100 - 50 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 50 small widgets and 50 large widgets.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this makes sense. If there are 50 small widgets at 5 pounds each, that's \\( 50 \\times 5 = 250 \\) pounds. And 50 large widgets at 10 pounds each is \\( 50 \\times 10 = 500 \\) pounds. Adding those up: \\( 250 + 500 = 750 \\) pounds, which matches the total weight given. Also, \\( 50 + 50 = 100 \\) widgets, which matches the total number of widgets. So, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is by using the elimination method. I can manipulate the equations to eliminate one of the variables.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( s + l = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5s + 10l = 750 \\)\n\nI can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 5:\n\n\\[ s + 2l = 150 \\]\n\nNow, I have:\n\n1. \\( s + l = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( s + 2l = 150 \\)\n\nNext, I can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ (s + 2l) - (s + l) = 150 - 100 \\]\n\n\\[ s + 2l - s - l = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ l = 50 \\]\n\nAgain, I get \\( l = 50 \\), and then \\( s = 100 - 50 = 50 \\).\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same conclusion: there are 50 small widgets and 50 large widgets.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this problem. Maybe using ratios or something else.\n\nLet's think about the average weight of the widgets. The total weight is 750 pounds for 100 widgets, so the average weight per widget is \\( 750 \\div 100 = 7.5 \\) pounds.\n\nNow, since small widgets are 5 pounds and large ones are 10 pounds, the average being 7.5 pounds is right in the middle. That suggests an equal number of small and large widgets, which aligns with our earlier result of 50 small and 50 large.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the difference in weight. Each large widget is 5 pounds heavier than a small one (10 - 5 = 5 pounds).\n\nIf all 100 widgets were small, the total weight would be \\( 100 \\times 5 = 500 \\) pounds. But the actual total weight is 750 pounds, which is 250 pounds more than 500 pounds.\n\nSince each large widget adds an extra 5 pounds, the number of large widgets is \\( 250 \\div 5 = 50 \\). Then, the number of small widgets is \\( 100 - 50 = 50 \\), which again confirms our previous result.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same answer. It seems pretty solid.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there could be other solutions. For example, if there were more small widgets and fewer large ones, would the total weight still add up to 750 pounds?\n\nSuppose there are 60 small widgets and 40 large widgets.\n\nThen, the total weight would be \\( 60 \\times 5 + 40 \\times 10 = 300 + 400 = 700 \\) pounds, which is less than 750 pounds.\n\nAlternatively, if there are 40 small widgets and 60 large widgets:\n\n\\( 40 \\times 5 + 60 \\times 10 = 200 + 600 = 800 \\) pounds, which is more than 750 pounds.\n\nSo, only 50 small and 50 large widgets give the exact total weight of 750 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the factory produced 50 small widgets and 50 large widgets on Monday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ small widgets and } 50 \\text{ large widgets}} \\]"
