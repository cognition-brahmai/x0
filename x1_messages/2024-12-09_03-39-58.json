        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units each day, and each unit costs $20 to make. They sell each unit for $30. I need to find out how much profit they make each day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total production cost per day. Since each unit costs $20 and they make 500 units, I can multiply 500 by 20 to get the total cost.\n\n500 units * $20/unit = $10,000\n\nSo, the total production cost per day is $10,000.\n\nNext, I need to find out how much they make from selling these units. They sell each unit for $30, so again, I'll multiply the number of units by the selling price.\n\n500 units * $30/unit = $15,000\n\nSo, their daily revenue is $15,000.\n\nNow, to find the profit, I need to subtract the total production cost from the revenue.\n\n$15,000 - $10,000 = $5,000\n\nTherefore, the daily profit is $5,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any other costs involved, like overhead or labor? The problem only mentions production cost per unit, so maybe that's all inclusive.\n\nHmm, but just to be sure, let's see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach could be to find the profit per unit and then multiply by the number of units.\n\nSo, profit per unit would be selling price minus production cost.\n\n$30 - $20 = $10 per unit\n\nThen, total profit would be $10 per unit * 500 units = $5,000\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, I think $5,000 is the correct daily profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5000} \\]"
