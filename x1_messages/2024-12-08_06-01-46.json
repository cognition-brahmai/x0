        "content": "Yes, Mount Everest is considered the tallest mountain on Earth. It has an elevation of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level and is located in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal and China (Tibet Autonomous Region). The mountain was formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, which continues to push it higher over time. Scaling Mount Everest is a significant achievement for mountaineers due to its extreme altitude and challenging weather conditions."
