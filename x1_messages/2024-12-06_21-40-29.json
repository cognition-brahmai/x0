        "content": "So there are 25 red balls and 15 blue balls in a box, making a total of 40 balls. I need to find the probability that if I draw two balls at random without replacing them, both of them will be red.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible ways to draw two balls from 40 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 40 is C(40, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(40, 2) = 40! / (2!(40 - 2)!) = (40 \u00d7 39) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 780.\n\nSo, there are 780 possible ways to draw 2 balls from 40.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from the 25 red balls.\n\nSo, that's C(25, 2).\n\nCalculating C(25, 2):\n\nC(25, 2) = 25! / (2!(25 - 2)!) = (25 \u00d7 24) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 300.\n\nSo, there are 300 ways to choose 2 red balls from 25.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 300 / 780.\n\nSimplifying that fraction:\n\n300 / 780 = 30 / 78 = 15 / 39 = 5 / 13.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/13.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sequential probabilities.\n\nThe probability that the first ball drawn is red is 25/40, since there are 25 red balls out of 40.\n\nThen, since we're not replacing the first ball, there are now 24 red balls left and a total of 39 balls left in the box.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also red is 24/39.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is (25/40) \u00d7 (24/39).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 25/40 = 5/8.\n\nSecond, 24/39 = 8/13.\n\nSo, (5/8) \u00d7 (8/13) = (5 \u00d7 8) / (8 \u00d7 13) = 40 / 104 = 5 / 13.\n\nSo, again, I get 5/13.\n\nHmm, but I feel like that might be wrong because I think the probability should be lower.\n\nLet me see, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, no. 25/40 is indeed 5/8, and 24/39 is indeed 8/13.\n\nMultiplying them gives 40/104, which simplifies to 5/13.\n\nAlternatively, using the combination method, I got the same answer.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 5/13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}} \\]"
