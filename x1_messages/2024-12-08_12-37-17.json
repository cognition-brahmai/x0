You want to know how far it has traveled, right?\n\nWell, to find the distance traveled, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 550 miles per hour, and the time is 6 hours. So, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 550 miles/hour \u00d7 6 hours\n\nWhen you multiply these, the \"hours\" unit cancels out, leaving you with miles.\n\nSo, Distance = 3300 miles\n\nTherefore, the airplane has traveled 3300 miles to reach its destination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3300} \\]"
