        "content": "So there are 500 students who can vote in the school election. Out of these, 60% voted for candidate A, and the remaining students voted for candidate B. We need to find out how many more votes candidate A received compared to candidate B.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students voted for candidate A. Since 60% of the 500 students voted for candidate A, we can calculate this by multiplying 500 by 60%.\n\nTo make it easier, we can convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 0.60.\n\nSo, votes for candidate A = 500 * 0.60 = 300 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many students voted for candidate B, we can subtract the votes for candidate A from the total number of voters.\n\nVotes for candidate B = total votes - votes for candidate A = 500 - 300 = 200 votes.\n\nNext, to find out how many more votes candidate A received than candidate B, we subtract the votes for candidate B from the votes for candidate A.\n\nDifference in votes = votes for candidate A - votes for candidate B = 300 - 200 = 100 votes.\n\nSo, candidate A received 100 more votes than candidate B.\n\nAlternatively, since 60% voted for candidate A and 40% voted for candidate B (because 100% - 60% = 40%), the difference in their percentages is 60% - 40% = 20%.\n\nTo find 20% of 500, we can calculate 0.20 * 500 = 100 votes, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, candidate A received 100 more votes than candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
