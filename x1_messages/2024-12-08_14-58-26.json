For each plan, indicate which external tool along with its input to gather evidence. You can store the evidence into a variable #E[index] that can be referred later.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: A tool that lets you perform searches using Bing search engine. It provides a list of sites that might contain the answer to your query.\nPageLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links. Input is one or more links, and it produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and gives a plain text, newline delimited response of URLs.\nKnowledgeAI[input]: A question-answering AI model that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that refers to a #E[n] variable.\n\nThe output should be in this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the primary diet of the Giant Panda and where is it commonly found?"

I can use the URLExtractor tool to parse the search results and get the URLs.\n\n#E2 = URLExtractor[#E1]\n\nPlan: Now that I have the URLs, I need to load the content from these pages to read about the Giant Panda's diet and habitat. I'll use the PageLoader tool to extract the text from these websites.\n\n#E3 = PageLoader[#E2]\n\nPlan: With the text content from the websites, I can now ask a question-answering AI model to summarize the information about the Giant Panda's primary diet and common habitats. I'll use the KnowledgeAI tool for this purpose, referencing the context from #E3.\n\n#E4 = KnowledgeAI[\"What is the primary diet of the Giant Panda and where is it commonly found?
