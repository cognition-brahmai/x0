        "content": "So I've got this problem about a new roller coaster in a theme park. Let's see what it's asking for. First, I need to calculate the maximum number of guests that can experience the roller coaster in one hour. Then, I have to estimate the annual revenue generated by this attraction, given that the park charges $10 per ride and operates 300 days per year.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many rides can happen in one hour. The roller coaster has a maximum capacity of 24 passengers per ride, and each ride lasts 3 minutes, with an additional 2 minutes for boarding and disembarking. So, the total time per ride cycle is 3 minutes + 2 minutes = 5 minutes per cycle.\n\nNow, there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the number of ride cycles per hour would be 60 minutes divided by 5 minutes per cycle. That is:\n\n60 \u00f7 5 = 12 cycles per hour.\n\nEach cycle can carry 24 passengers, so the maximum number of guests per hour would be:\n\n24 passengers/cycle \u00d7 12 cycles/hour = 288 passengers/hour.\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the annual revenue. The park charges $10 per ride, and operates 300 days per year. But, I need to be careful here. The number of rides per day depends on the number of ride cycles per day.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many ride cycles there are in a day. Assuming the park is open for, say, 10 hours a day, then:\n\nNumber of cycles per day = 12 cycles/hour \u00d7 10 hours/day = 120 cycles/day.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the number of operating hours per day. Hmm. Maybe I should assume a certain number of operating hours per day. Let's assume the park is open for 10 hours a day, which is a common duration for theme parks.\n\nSo, with 12 cycles per hour, over 10 hours, that's 120 cycles per day.\n\nEach cycle has 24 passengers, but since the charge is per ride, and each ride is for 24 passengers, the revenue per ride is $10 per ride.\n\nWait a minute, is it $10 per passenger or $10 per ride? The problem says \"$10 per ride,\" so each ride generates $10 in revenue, regardless of the number of passengers.\n\nSo, if each ride (cycle) generates $10, and there are 120 cycles per day, then the daily revenue is:\n\n120 cycles/day \u00d7 $10/cycle = $1,200/day.\n\nThen, over 300 operating days per year, the annual revenue would be:\n\n$1,200/day \u00d7 300 days/year = $360,000/year.\n\nWait, but this seems too simplistic. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, maximum guests per hour: 24 passengers per ride, 12 rides per hour, equals 288 passengers per hour.\n\nThen, assuming 10-hour operating day: 12 rides/hour \u00d7 10 hours = 120 rides/day.\n\nRevenue per ride: $10.\n\nSo, daily revenue: 120 rides/day \u00d7 $10/ride = $1,200/day.\n\nAnnual revenue: $1,200/day \u00d7 300 days/year = $360,000/year.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but maybe I should consider if all rides are fully booked. The problem says \"maximum capacity,\" so assuming the rides are always full.\n\nAlso, I assumed 10 operating hours per day. If the park operates more or less hours, the revenue would change accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, if the park has multiple shifts or extended hours on certain days, that could affect the total.\n\nBut based on the information given, assuming 10 hours per day, 300 days per year, with maximum capacity per ride, the annual revenue would be $360,000.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider that some rides might not be full, due to queue times or guest preferences. But the problem asks for maximum potential, so assuming full capacity is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $10 per ride is per passenger, not per ride. The problem says \"$10 per ride,\" which suggests per ride, not per passenger. But, to clarify, if it's per ride, and each ride carries 24 passengers, then the revenue per ride is $10, which seems quite low. Maybe it's per passenger.\n\nLet me check again. It says \"charges $10 per ride.\" So, it's $10 per ride, regardless of the number of passengers. That seems unusual, but that's what it says.\n\nSo, in that case, with 120 rides per day, revenue is $1,200/day.\n\nBut if it's $10 per passenger, then it would be 24 passengers per ride \u00d7 $10/passenger \u00d7 120 rides/day = $28,800/day.\n\nWait, that seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the pricing.\n\nIf it's $10 per ride, and a ride is for 24 passengers, then it's $10 per group of 24 passengers.\n\nThat seems like a group rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's $10 per passenger, meaning each passenger pays $10 for a ride.\n\nThe problem says \"charges $10 per ride,\" which could be interpreted in two ways.\n\nI think it's more common for theme parks to charge per individual passenger, but perhaps in this case, it's a group ride charge.\n\nGiven that, I'll consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: $10 per ride, regardless of the number of passengers.\n\nIn this case, each ride generates $10 in revenue.\n\nSo, with 120 rides per day, revenue is $1,200/day.\n\nOver 300 days, that's $360,000/year.\n\nSecond scenario: $10 per passenger per ride.\n\nIn this case, each ride generates 24 passengers \u00d7 $10/passenger = $240 per ride.\n\nWith 120 rides per day, revenue is $240/ride \u00d7 120 rides/day = $28,800/day.\n\nOver 300 days, that's $28,800/day \u00d7 300 days = $8,640,000/year.\n\nThere's a big difference between the two interpretations.\n\nGiven that, I think it's more likely that it's $10 per passenger, as charging $10 per ride (regardless of the number of passengers) would be unusual and result in very low revenue.\n\nBut to be precise, I should stick to what the problem says, which is \"$10 per ride.\"\n\nSo, if it's $10 per ride, then it's $10 per ride, regardless of the number of passengers.\n\nTherefore, the annual revenue would be $360,000.\n\nHowever, this seems counterintuitive, as the revenue seems too low for a theme park attraction.\n\nMaybe I should check if \"per ride\" refers to per cycle or per passenger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $10 is the ticket price for the entire park, and the roller coaster is included.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense with the wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's $10 per ride, where each ride is for 24 passengers, so the $10 is collected per group of 24 passengers.\n\nBut that would still result in $10 per ride, regardless of the number of passengers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $10 is per passenger, but the problem says \"per ride.\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should consider both possibilities and present both calculations.\n\nFirst, assuming $10 per ride (regardless of passengers):\n\nRevenue per ride = $10\n\nRides per day = 120\n\nDaily revenue = 120 \u00d7 $10 = $1,200\n\nAnnual revenue = $1,200 \u00d7 300 = $360,000\n\nSecond, assuming $10 per passenger:\n\nRevenue per ride = 24 passengers \u00d7 $10/passenger = $240\n\nRides per day = 120\n\nDaily revenue = 120 \u00d7 $240 = $28,800\n\nAnnual revenue = $28,800 \u00d7 300 = $8,640,000\n\nGiven this discrepancy, I think the more plausible interpretation is $10 per passenger, leading to $8,640,000 annual revenue.\n\nBut to be accurate, I should go with the wording provided: \"$10 per ride,\" which would be $10 per cycle, resulting in $360,000 annual revenue.\n\nHowever, this seems too low, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $10 is the price for a single ride, and passengers can ride multiple times.\n\nBut the problem says \"charges $10 per ride,\" which seems to refer to the price per ride experience.\n\nGiven that, and assuming each ride generates $10 in revenue, then annual revenue is $360,000.\n\nBut this seems unusually low for a roller coaster attraction.\n\nPerhaps the park sells packages or has different pricing models.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $10 is the price for a ticket that includes access to multiple rides.\n\nBut based on the information provided, I think the straightforward interpretation is $10 per ride, where \"ride\" refers to a single cycle of the roller coaster, regardless of the number of passengers.\n\nTherefore, the annual revenue would be $360,000.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if there are any other factors that could affect the revenue.\n\nFor example, perhaps the roller coaster has to be closed for maintenance or other reasons, reducing the number of operating days or hours.\n\nOr maybe there are peak and off-peak seasons affecting daily operations.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide specifics on that, so assuming constant operation over 300 days per year, with 10 hours per day, the calculation stands.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that guests spend an additional 2 minutes boarding and disembarking, which is already factored into the 5-minute cycle time per ride.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary aspects.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Maximum guests per hour: 288 passengers\n\n- Annual revenue: $360,000\n\nBut given the seeming discrepancy in revenue, perhaps it's worth considering that the $10 is per passenger, not per ride.\n\nIf that's the case, then annual revenue would be $8,640,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the park allows multiple rides with one ticket, or has season passes, but the problem specifies \"$10 per ride.\"\n\nGiven that, I think the initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of guests per hour is 288, and the annual revenue is $360,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{288 \\text{ guests per hour}, \\$360,000 \\text{ annual revenue}}\\]"
