        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students, and each student plays either basketball or soccer, but not both. Also, it's given that twice as many students play basketball as those who play soccer. We need to find out how many students play soccer.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say the number of students who play soccer is S, and the number of students who play basketball is B.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. Every student plays either basketball or soccer, but not both. That means the total number of students is the sum of those who play basketball and those who play soccer. So, B + S = 30.\n\n2. Twice as many students play basketball as those who play soccer. That means B = 2S.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. B + S = 30\n\n2. B = 2S\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of S.\n\nSo, substituting B with 2S in the first equation:\n\n2S + S = 30\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3S = 30\n\nNow, to find S, we divide both sides by 3:\n\nS = 30 / 3\n\nS = 10\n\nSo, 10 students play soccer.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If S = 10, then B = 2S = 20. And 20 + 10 = 30, which matches the total number of students. Looks good!\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of basketball to soccer players. Since twice as many play basketball as soccer, the ratio is 2:1. So, for every 3 students (2 playing basketball and 1 playing soccer), there are 3 students.\n\nGiven there are 30 students in total, we can divide 30 by 3 to find out how many groups of 3 there are:\n\n30 / 3 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 groups of 3 students. Since each group has 1 soccer player, there are 10 soccer players in total.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation, so we can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
