        "content": "I'm going to create a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express that handles CRUD operations for a collection of books. Each book will have a title, author, and publication year. Since we're not using an external database, I'll store the books in memory using an array.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a new Node.js project. I'll create a directory for my project and initialize it with npm.\n\n```bash\nmkdir book-api\ncd book-api\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nNext, I'll install Express, which is a lightweight web application framework for Node.js.\n\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\nNow, I'll create a new file called `app.js` and set up the basic structure of an Express application.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);\n});\n```\n\nThis sets up an Express server that listens on port 3000.\n\nSince I need to handle JSON data, I'll add middleware to parse JSON request bodies.\n\n```javascript\napp.use(express.json());\n```\n\nNow, I'll define an in-memory array to store the books.\n\n```javascript\nlet books = [];\nlet idCounter = 1;\n```\n\nEach book will have an ID, which I'll manage using the `idCounter` variable.\n\nLet's define the structure of a book object.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Book(id, title, author, publicationYear) {\n  this.id = id;\n  this.title = title;\n  this.author = author;\n  this.publicationYear = publicationYear;\n}\n```\n\nI'll implement the CRUD operations:\n\n1. **Create** a new book (POST /books)\n2. **Read** all books (GET /books)\n3. **Read** a single book by ID (GET /books/:id)\n4. **Update** a book by ID (PUT /books/:id)\n5. **Delete** a book by ID (DELETE /books/:id)\n\nFirst, the POST endpoint to create a new book.\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const { title, author, publicationYear } = req.body;\n  if (!title || !author || !publicationYear) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing fields' });\n  }\n  const newBook = new Book(idCounter++, title, author, publicationYear);\n  books.push(newBook);\n  res.status(201).json(newBook);\n});\n```\n\nNext, the GET endpoint to retrieve all books.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(books);\n});\n```\n\nThen, the GET endpoint to retrieve a single book by ID.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const book = books.find(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (!book) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  res.json(book);\n});\n```\n\nNow, the PUT endpoint to update a book by ID.\n\n```javascript\napp.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (index === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  const { title, author, publicationYear } = req.body;\n  if (!title || !author || !publicationYear) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing fields' });\n  }\n  books[index] = new Book(bookId, title, author, publicationYear);\n  res.json(books[index]);\n});\n```\n\nFinally, the DELETE endpoint to remove a book by ID.\n\n```javascript\napp.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = books.findIndex(b => b.id === bookId);\n  if (index === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n  const deletedBook = books.splice(index, 1);\n  res.json(deletedBook[0]);\n});\n```\n\nThat's the basic CRUD API for books. To make it more robust, I might want to add some error handling and validation, but this covers the essential functionality.\n\nI can test this API using tools like Postman or curl to send HTTP requests to the respective endpoints.\n\nFor example, to create a new book:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/books -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"Sample Book\",\"author\":\"John Doe\",\"publicationYear\":2020}'\n```\n\nTo get all books:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:3000/books\n```\n\nTo get a single book by ID:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:3000/books/1\n```\n\nTo update a book:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"Updated Book\",\"author\":\"Jane Doe\",\"publicationYear\":2021}'\n```\n\nTo delete a book:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/1\n```\n\nThis should cover the requirements for a simple in-memory RESTful API for managing books using Node.js and Express."
