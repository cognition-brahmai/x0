        "content": "Let's calculate the total cost of the customer's purchase. The store sells apples at $1.50 per pound and oranges at $2.00 per pound. The customer bought 8 pounds of apples and 6 pounds of oranges.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how much the apples cost. Since apples are $1.50 per pound and the customer bought 8 pounds, I'll multiply 1.50 by 8.\n\n1.50 \u00d7 8 = 12.00\n\nSo, the apples cost $12.00.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $2.00 per pound, and the customer bought 6 pounds, so I'll multiply 2.00 by 6.\n\n2.00 \u00d7 6 = 12.00\n\nThe oranges also cost $12.00.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I'll add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together.\n\n12.00 + 12.00 = 24.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the customer's purchase is $24.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24.00} \\]"
