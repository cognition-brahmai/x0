        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the company has a budget of $10,000 for employee bonuses. But before they can distribute the bonuses, they need to deduct a 5% administrative fee from that budget. After deduction, the remaining amount will be divided equally among the 20 employees.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the administrative fee. That's 5% of $10,000. To find 5% of something, I can multiply it by 0.05.\n\nAdministrative fee = 5% of $10,000 = 0.05 * 10,000 = $500.\n\nNow, I need to subtract this fee from the total budget to find out how much is left for the bonuses.\n\nRemaining budget = Total budget - Administrative fee = $10,000 - $500 = $9,500.\n\nThis $9,500 will be divided equally among the 20 employees. So, to find out how much each employee gets, I need to divide $9,500 by 20.\n\nBonus per employee = Remaining budget / Number of employees = $9,500 / 20.\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n$9,500 \u00f7 20 = $475.\n\nSo, each employee will receive a bonus of $475.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the administrative fee: 5% of $10,000 is indeed $500.\n\nThen, subtracting that from the total budget: $10,000 - $500 = $9,500.\n\nFinally, dividing $9,500 by 20 employees: $9,500 / 20 = $475 per employee.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the remaining percentage after deduction. If 5% is deducted, then 95% of the budget is left for bonuses.\n\nSo, 95% of $10,000 is $9,500, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, dividing that by 20 gives $475 per employee.\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{475} \\]"
