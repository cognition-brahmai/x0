        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, in total, there are 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls in the bag. The problem is asking for the probability of randomly selecting two balls without replacement, and specifically, one ball should be red and the other should be blue.\n\nOkay, first things first, since it's without replacement, the first ball I pick will affect the second pick because there's one less ball in the bag after the first pick.\n\nSo, I need to find the probability that one is red and the other is blue. That means either I pick a red first and then a blue, or a blue first and then a red.\n\nMaybe I can calculate the probability of each scenario separately and then add them together.\n\nLet's start with picking a red first and then a blue.\n\nThe probability of picking a red first: there are 5 red balls out of 10 total balls, so that's 5/10 or 1/2.\n\nAfter picking a red ball, there are now 9 balls left in the bag: 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green.\n\nThen, the probability of picking a blue ball next: there are 3 blue balls out of 9 total balls, so that's 3/9 or 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red first and then a blue is (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6.\n\nNow, let's consider picking a blue first and then a red.\n\nThe probability of picking a blue first: there are 3 blue balls out of 10 total balls, so that's 3/10.\n\nAfter picking a blue ball, there are now 9 balls left: 5 red, 2 blue, and 2 green.\n\nThen, the probability of picking a red ball next: there are 5 red balls out of 9 total balls, so that's 5/9.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a blue first and then a red is (3/10) * (5/9) = (3*5)/(10*9) = 15/90, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nNow, since these are two distinct sequences, I can add their probabilities together to get the total probability of picking one red and one blue ball in any order.\n\nSo, total probability = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this?\n\nMaybe using combinations. Since we're picking two balls without replacement, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 10 is C(10,2), which is 45.\n\nNow, the number of ways to pick one red and one blue ball is the number of ways to pick one red out of five times one blue out of three, which is C(5,1) * C(3,1) = 5 * 3 = 15.\n\nSo, the probability should be 15/45, which is also 1/3.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nSuppose I consider the order doesn't matter. Since it's without replacement and I'm interested in one red and one blue, regardless of order.\n\nSo, in that case, using combinations makes sense, as I did above.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the second ball is blue given that the first is red, plus the probability that the second ball is red given that the first is blue.\n\nWait, but that seems more complicated than the first approach.\n\nLet me see.\n\nProbability that the second ball is blue given the first is red: that's P(2nd blue | 1st red) = 3/9, as I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, P(2nd red | 1st blue) = 5/9.\n\nBut then, I need to multiply each by the probability of the first event.\n\nSo, P(1st red) is 5/10, and P(1st blue) is 3/10.\n\nSo, total probability would be P(1st red) * P(2nd blue | 1st red) + P(1st blue) * P(2nd red | 1st blue) = (5/10)*(3/9) + (3/10)*(5/9) = (15/90) + (15/90) = 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nGood, it's consistent.\n\nI think 1/3 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
