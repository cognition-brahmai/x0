        "content": "In nutritional science, Vitamin A is the fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in vision, growth and development, and immune function. So the correct answer is D. Vitamin A.\n\nTo provide some more detail, Vitamin A is essential for maintaining good vision, particularly in low-light conditions. It is also vital for the proper growth and development of cells and tissues, and it helps to keep the skin and mucous membranes healthy, which in turn supports the immune system.\n\nThe other options are water-soluble vitamins:\n\n- Vitamin B12 is important for nerve function and the production of red blood cells.\n\n- Vitamin C is crucial for the growth and repair of tissues in the body, and it also acts as an antioxidant.\n\n- Vitamin D is actually a fat-soluble vitamin, but it's known primarily for its role in calcium absorption and bone health, rather than the functions listed in the question.\n\nSo, while all these vitamins are important, Vitamin A specifically fulfills the roles mentioned in the question."
