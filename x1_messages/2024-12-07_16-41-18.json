        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students studying languages. There are 30 students in total. Some study French, some study Spanish, and some study both. I need to find out how many students don't study either language. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that 12 students study French and 18 study Spanish. But, 8 students study both languages. So, if I just add 12 and 18, that would be 30, but that includes the students who study both languages twice, once in French and once in Spanish. So, I need to account for that overlap.\n\nMaybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. That's where you add the number of students studying French and Spanish, and then subtract those who are studying both since they've been counted twice.\n\nSo, number of students studying either French or Spanish would be:\n\nNumber studying French + Number studying Spanish - Number studying both\n\nThat would be 12 + 18 - 8 = 22 students.\n\nNow, since there are 30 students in total, the number of students who don't study either language would be:\n\nTotal students - Students studying French or Spanish\n\nSo, 30 - 22 = 8 students.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nI have:\n\n- Total students: 30\n\n- Study French: 12\n\n- Study Spanish: 18\n\n- Study both: 8\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nOnly French: 12 - 8 = 4\n\nOnly Spanish: 18 - 8 = 10\n\nBoth: 8\n\nSo, total studying a language: 4 + 10 + 8 = 22\n\nTherefore, not studying either: 30 - 22 = 8\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents French students, the other represents Spanish students.\n\n- The overlap (both languages) has 8 students.\n\n- Only French would be 12 - 8 = 4\n\n- Only Spanish would be 18 - 8 = 10\n\nSo, adding up the parts: 4 (only French) + 10 (only Spanish) + 8 (both) = 22 students studying at least one language.\n\nTherefore, 30 - 22 = 8 students don't study either language.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let F be the set of students studying French.\n\n- Let S be the set of students studying Spanish.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |F| = 12\n\n- |S| = 18\n\n- |F \u2229 S| = 8\n\nWe need to find the number of students who don't study either language, which is the number of students not in F or S, i.e., the complement of F \u222a S.\n\nFirst, find |F \u222a S| = |F| + |S| - |F \u2229 S| = 12 + 18 - 8 = 22\n\nThen, the number of students not studying either language is:\n\nTotal students - |F \u222a S| = 30 - 22 = 8\n\nSo, again, 8 students don't study either language.\n\nWait, is there a chance that some students might be studying other languages not mentioned here? The problem says \"study French, study Spanish, and study both languages.\" So, it seems like only these two languages are being considered.\n\nAssuming that only French and Spanish are the languages offered, and no other languages are being studied, then the calculation should be correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of students studying other subjects that might affect this count. The problem doesn't mention any other subjects, so I think it's safe to assume that only French and Spanish are being considered.\n\nTherefore, the number of students not studying either language is 8.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
