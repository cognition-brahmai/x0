        "content": "Oh, that's an interesting question! Let me think about this. I know that the Great Wall of China is one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World, and it's known for its immense length and historical significance in China. On the other hand, the University of Cambridge is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the world, located in England.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out when the Great Wall was built. I recall that the construction of the Great Wall started way back in the 7th century BC by various Chinese states to protect their territories. Then, during the Qin Dynasty around 220-206 BC, the first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, connected and extended these walls to form a more unified defensive fortification. So, the Great Wall has a very long history, with different sections built at different times.\n\nNow, about the University of Cambridge. I believe it was founded in the 13th century. I think around 1209, but I'm not entirely sure. It was established as a place of higher learning, and it has a rich history of producing renowned scholars and scientists.\n\nSo, comparing the two, the Great Wall has origins dating back to the 7th century BC, while the University of Cambridge was founded in the 13th century AD. That means the Great Wall came into existence much earlier than the University of Cambridge.\n\nBut to be absolutely precise, I should note that the Great Wall as we know it today is mostly from the Ming Dynasty, which is from the 14th to the 17th century, which is even closer in time to the founding of Cambridge. However, the initial constructions predate Cambridge by many centuries.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the Great Wall of China came into existence first, with its earliest sections being built in the 7th century BC, while the University of Cambridge was founded in the 13th century AD.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The Great Wall of China came into existence first.}} \\]"
