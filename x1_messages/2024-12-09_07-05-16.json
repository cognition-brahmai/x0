        "content": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, was an agreement between the Catholic Monarchs of Spain and the King of Portugal. It was brokered by Pope Alexander VI, who was Spanish, to resolve disputes over newly discovered lands during the Age of Discovery.\n\nThe main consequence of the Treaty of Tordesillas was that it divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. This division was intended to clarify which empire had the right to claim and colonize lands discovered beyond Europe.\n\nSo, in the context of world history, the main consequence of the Treaty of Tordesillas was that it divided the New World between Spain and Portugal. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"
