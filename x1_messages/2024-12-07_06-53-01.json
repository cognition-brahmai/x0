The store sells three types of items:\n\n- Type A: $15 each\n\n- Type B: $25 each\n\n- Type C: $40 each\n\nThe customer buys a total of 10 items, including:\n\n- 2 of type A\n\n- 4 of type B\n\n- The remaining items are type C\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many type C items were bought. Since the total number of items is 10, and the customer bought 2 type A and 4 type B, we can calculate the number of type C items as follows:\n\nNumber of type C items = Total items - (Type A items + Type B items) = 10 - (2 + 4) = 10 - 6 = 4\n\nSo, the customer bought 4 type C items.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item:\n\n- Cost of type A items: 2 items * $15/item = $30\n\n- Cost of type B items: 4 items * $25/item = $100\n\n- Cost of type C items: 4 items * $40/item = $160\n\nNow, we add up these amounts to find the total cost of the purchase:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of type A + Cost of type B + Cost of type C = $30 + $100 + $160 = $290\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the customer's purchase is $290."
