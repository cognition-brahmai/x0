        "content": "Creating a basic blockchain system in Java involves several steps. We need to define what a block is, how blocks are linked together to form a chain, and how to ensure the integrity of the chain through cryptographic hashes and a proof-of-work mechanism.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Block\n\nEach block in the blockchain will contain:\n\n- An index\n- Timestamp\n- Data\n- Hash of the previous block\n- Its own hash\n-Nonce (for proof-of-work)\n\nWe'll use the `java.util.Date` class for timestamps and `java.security.MessageDigest` for hashing.\n\n### Step 2: Implement Hashing\n\nWe need a method to generate a SHA-256 hash for a given string. This hash will be used to uniquely identify each block and ensure its integrity.\n\n### Step 3: Proof-of-Work\n\nTo add security, we'll implement a simple proof-of-work algorithm. This involves finding a nonce such that the hash of the block starts with a certain number of zeros. The difficulty can be adjusted by changing the number of zeros required.\n\n### Step 4: Blockchain Class\n\nThis class will manage the chain of blocks. It should include methods to:\n\n- Add a new block\n- Validate the entire chain\n- Detect any tampering\n\n### Step 5: Testing\n\nFinally, we'll write a simple test to create a blockchain, add some blocks, and verify its integrity.\n\n### Complete Code\n\n```java\nimport java.security.MessageDigest;\nimport java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;\nimport java.util.Date;\n\npublic class Block {\n    public int index;\n    public String data;\n    public String previousHash;\n    public String hash;\n    public long timestamp;\n    public int nonce;\n\n    public Block(int index, String data, String previousHash) {\n        this.index = index;\n        this.data = data;\n        this.previousHash = previousHash;\n        this.timestamp = new Date().getTime();\n        this.nonce = 0;\n        this.hash = calculateHash();\n    }\n\n    public String calculateHash() {\n        try {\n            MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");\n            String input = index + previousHash + Long.toString(timestamp) + data + nonce;\n            byte[] hash = digest.digest(input.getBytes());\n            StringBuilder hexString = new StringBuilder();\n\n            for (byte b : hash) {\n                String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & b);\n                if (hex.length() == 1) hexString.append('0');\n                hexString.append(hex);\n            }\n            return hexString.toString();\n        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void mineBlock(int difficulty) {\n        String target = new String(new char[difficulty]).replace('\\0', '0');\n        while (!hash.substring(0, difficulty).equals(target)) {\n            nonce++;\n            hash = calculateHash();\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"Block mined: \" + hash);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Blockchain {\n    private List<Block> chain;\n    private int difficulty;\n\n    public Blockchain(int difficulty) {\n        this.chain = new ArrayList<>();\n        this.difficulty = difficulty;\n        createGenesisBlock();\n    }\n\n    private void createGenesisBlock() {\n        chain.add(new Block(0, \"Genesis Block\", \"0\"));\n    }\n\n    public Block getLatestBlock() {\n        return chain.get(chain.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    public void addBlock(Block newBlock) {\n        newBlock.previousHash = getLatestBlock().hash;\n        newBlock.mineBlock(difficulty);\n        chain.add(newBlock);\n    }\n\n    public boolean isChainValid() {\n        for (int i = 1; i < chain.size(); i++) {\n            Block current = chain.get(i);\n            Block previous = chain.get(i - 1);\n\n            if (!current.hash.equals(current.calculateHash())) {\n                System.out.println(\"Current hash of the block doesn't match calculated hash.\");\n                return false;\n            }\n\n            if (!current.previousHash.equals(previous.hash)) {\n                System.out.println(\"Previous hash of the current block doesn't match the hash of the previous block.\");\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Blockchain blockchain = new Blockchain(4); // Difficulty of 4\n\n        blockchain.addBlock(new Block(1, \"Transaction Data 1\", \"\"));\n        blockchain.addBlock(new Block(2, \"Transaction Data 2\", \"\"));\n        blockchain.addBlock(new Block(3, \"Transaction Data 3\", \"\"));\n\n        System.out.println(\"Is blockchain valid? \" + blockchain.isChainValid());\n\n        // Tamper with block 1\n        blockchain.chain.get(1).data = \"Tampered Data\";\n        blockchain.chain.get(1).hash = blockchain.chain.get(1).calculateHash();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Is blockchain valid after tampering? \" + blockchain.isChainValid());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Block Class**:\n   - Represents a single block in the blockchain.\n   - Contains fields like index, data, timestamps, hashes, and nonce.\n   - `calculateHash()` generates a SHA-256 hash for the block.\n   - `mineBlock(int difficulty)` implements proof-of-work by finding a nonce that makes the hash start with a specified number of zeros.\n\n2. **Blockchain Class**:\n   - Manages the list of blocks.\n   - `createGenesisBlock()` initializes the blockchain with the first block.\n   - `addBlock(Block newBlock)` adds a new block to the chain after setting the previous hash and mining the block.\n   - `isChainValid()` checks the integrity of the blockchain by verifying each block's hash and the link to the previous block.\n\n3. **Main Class**:\n   - Creates a blockchain with a difficulty of 4.\n   - Adds several blocks and checks if the blockchain is valid.\n   - Demonstrates tampering by changing data in a block and checks the validity again, which should now fail.\n\nThis basic implementation provides a foundation for understanding blockchain mechanics, including hashing, chaining blocks, and a simple proof-of-work mechanism."
