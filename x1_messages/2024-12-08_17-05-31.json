        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out the profit for each type of widget and then add them together to get the total profit.\n\nStarting with Type X:\n\n- They sold 200 units at $50 each, with a profit margin of 20%.\n\nFirst, calculate the total sales revenue for Type X:\n\n200 units * $50/unit = $10,000\n\nNow, the profit margin is 20%, which means they make a 20% profit on each sale. To find the profit, we can calculate 20% of the sales revenue.\n\nProfit for Type X = 20% of $10,000\n\nTo calculate 20% of $10,000:\n\n(20/100) * $10,000 = $2,000\n\nSo, the profit from Type X is $2,000.\n\nNow, for Type Y:\n\n- They sold 150 units at $80 each, with a profit margin of 30%.\n\nFirst, calculate the total sales revenue for Type Y:\n\n150 units * $80/unit = $12,000\n\nThe profit margin is 30%, so the profit is 30% of the sales revenue.\n\nProfit for Type Y = 30% of $12,000\n\nTo calculate 30% of $12,000:\n\n(30/100) * $12,000 = $3,600\n\nSo, the profit from Type Y is $3,600.\n\nNow, to find the total profit, we add the profits from both types:\n\nTotal profit = Profit from Type X + Profit from Type Y\n\nTotal profit = $2,000 + $3,600 = $5,600\n\nTherefore, the company's total profit from selling both types of widgets is $5,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5600} \\]"
