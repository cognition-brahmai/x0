Each plan should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be the user question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows you to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool is useful in finding relevant sites that may contain the answer to your question.\nWebReader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nSAM[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the dog, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen and what were their motivations?"
