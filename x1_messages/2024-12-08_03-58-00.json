        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden has a length of 20 meters and a width of 12 meters. I need to find two things: first, the area of the garden, and second, the length of the diagonal. Okay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nStarting with the area, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. Given that the length is 20 meters and the width is 12 meters, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = 20 meters * 12 meters = 240 square meters.\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward. Now, for the diagonal, I need to remember how to find the diagonal of a rectangle. I think it has something to do with the Pythagorean theorem, since a rectangle has right angles. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the diagonal of the rectangle acts as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle where the length and width are the other two sides. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal.\n\nLet's denote the diagonal as 'd', the length as 'l', and the width as 'w'. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd\u00b2 = l\u00b2 + w\u00b2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nd\u00b2 = (20 meters)\u00b2 + (12 meters)\u00b2 = 400 square meters + 144 square meters = 544 square meters.\n\nNow, to find 'd', I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\nd = \u221a544 meters.\n\nHmm, 544 isn't a perfect square, so I might want to simplify this square root. Let's see:\n\n544 can be factored into 16 * 34, and since 16 is a perfect square, I can take its square root out of the square root:\n\nd = \u221a(16 * 34) = \u221a16 * \u221a34 = 4 * \u221a34 meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could leave it as \u221a544 meters, but 4\u221a34 meters might be a bit cleaner. Alternatively, I could calculate the numerical value.\n\nLet me calculate \u221a544. The square root of 544 is approximately 23.32 meters.\n\nSo, the diagonal is approximately 23.32 meters.\n\nWait a minute, I should check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, area is indeed length times width, so 20 times 12 is 240 square meters. That seems correct.\n\nFor the diagonal, using the Pythagorean theorem: d\u00b2 = 20\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 400 + 144 = 544.\n\nThen, d = \u221a544.\n\nNow, \u221a544 can be simplified:\n\n544 divided by 16 is 34, so \u221a544 = \u221a(16*34) = 4\u221a34.\n\nAlternatively, calculating \u221a544 directly gives approximately 23.32 meters.\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nThe area of the garden is 240 square meters, and the length of the diagonal is approximately 23.32 meters or exactly 4\u221a34 meters.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\boxed{240 \\text{ square meters}} and the length of the diagonal is \\boxed{4\\sqrt{34} \\text{ meters} \\approx 23.32 \\text{ meters}}."
