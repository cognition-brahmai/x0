        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There are 40 students in total in the class. Out of these, there are 12 boys who play soccer, 16 girls who play basketball, and 8 boys who don't play any sport. I need to find out how many girls don't play any sport.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many boys there are in total. I know there are 12 boys who play soccer and 8 who don't play any sport. So, the total number of boys should be the sum of these two groups.\n\nTotal boys = boys who play soccer + boys who don't play any sport\nTotal boys = 12 + 8 = 20\n\nNow, since there are 40 students in total and 20 of them are boys, the remaining students must be girls.\n\nTotal girls = total students - total boys\nTotal girls = 40 - 20 = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 girls in the class.\n\nOut of these 20 girls, 16 play basketball. I need to find out how many girls don't play any sport.\n\nGirls who don't play any sport = total girls - girls who play basketball\nGirls who don't play any sport = 20 - 16 = 4\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me make sure I haven't missed anything. The problem mentions boys who play soccer, girls who play basketball, and boys who don't play any sport. It doesn't say anything about girls who play other sports, only those who play basketball and those who don't play any sport.\n\nSo, assuming that the only sports mentioned are soccer and basketball, and that students can either play one of these sports or none, then my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are girls who play soccer or boys who play basketball, but the problem doesn't mention any overlap like that. It seems like the sports are divided by gender in this scenario.\n\nLet me consider if there could be any girls who play soccer or boys who play basketball, but according to the problem, it's 12 boys who play soccer and 16 girls who play basketball. It doesn't mention any cross-over.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach, the number of girls who don't play any sport should be 4.\n\nBut let me think about it another way to confirm.\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nTotal boys = 20 (12 play soccer, 8 don't play any sport)\n\nTotal girls = 20 (16 play basketball, and the remaining should not play any sport)\n\nYes, that remaining would be 20 - 16 = 4 girls who don't play any sport.\n\nAlternatively, if there were girls who play soccer, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I don't need to account for that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"12 boys who play soccer\" and \"16 girls who play basketball\", which suggests that boys play soccer and girls play basketball, and there's no mention of any other combinations.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to assume that the 16 girls who play basketball are the only girls who play a sport, and the remaining girls don't play any sport.\n\nHence, the number of girls who don't play any sport is 4.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
