        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 houses on one side of the street and 15 on the other, making a total of 20 plus 15, which is 35 houses. And each house has an even number of people living in it, with the total number of people being 120.\n\nSo, to find the average number of people per house, I would normally just divide the total number of people by the number of houses. That would be 120 divided by 35. But wait, let's see what that comes out to.\n\n120 divided by 35 is... 35 times 3 is 105, and 120 minus 105 is 15, so it's 3 and some fraction. 15 divided by 35 is 3/7, so the average is 3 and 3/7 people per house. But the problem says that each house has an even number of people.\n\nHmm, that's confusing because 3 and 3/7 is not an even number, and moreover, it's not a whole number. But the number of people in each house is given to be even, which means it's an integer, and specifically an even integer.\n\nSo, maybe the average isn't an integer, but the individual house populations are even integers. Wait, but the question is asking for the average number of people per house.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation. Total people is 120, total houses is 20 plus 15, which is 35. So, 120 divided by 35 is indeed 3 and 3/7, which is approximately 3.4286.\n\nBut the problem states that each house has an even number of people, which implies that the number of people in each house is an even integer, like 2, 4, 6, etc.\n\nSo, is there a way for the average to be a fraction when the individual values are all integers? Yes, definitely. For example, if you have numbers like 2, 4, and 4, the average is 10/3, which is approximately 3.333, which is a fraction.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, even though each house has an even number of people, the average doesn't have to be an integer or even an even number.\n\nSo, the average number of people per house is 120 divided by 35, which is 120/35. Simplifying that fraction, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5, so 120 divided by 5 is 24, and 35 divided by 5 is 7, so it's 24/7.\n\n24/7 is approximately 3.4286, but since the question might expect the answer in fraction form, perhaps 24/7 is the exact average.\n\nBut the problem says \"how many people live in each house on average?\", and it doesn't specify whether to give the answer as a fraction or a decimal.\n\nGiven that 24/7 is exactly the average, and it's already in its simplest form, maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's more to this problem. Maybe there's a condition that all houses have the same number of people, but the problem doesn't state that. It just says each house has an even number of people, but not necessarily the same even number.\n\nWait, but if each house has a different even number, or some have the same, but the total is 120, and there are 35 houses.\n\nIs there a way to distribute the even numbers such that the total is 120?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose each house has at least 2 people (the smallest even number), then the minimum total would be 35 times 2, which is 70 people.\n\nBut the total is 120, which is 50 people more than the minimum.\n\nIf we want to distribute these extra 50 people among the 35 houses, with each house getting an even number of additional people, but since the additional people must keep the total per house even, perhaps we can add 0, 2, 4, etc. to each house.\n\nWait, but actually, since each house already has an even number, and we're adding an even number to keep it even, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the total additional people are 50, which need to be distributed in even numbers among the 35 houses.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nThe problem is asking for the average number of people per house, and I've calculated it to be 24/7, which is approximately 3.4286.\n\nBut the problem mentions that each house has an even number of people, and the average is not an even number nor an integer.\n\nIs there a contradiction here? No, because the average doesn't have to be an integer or even, even if the individual values are even integers.\n\nFor example, consider three houses with 2, 4, and 4 people. The total is 10, and the average is 10/3, which is approximately 3.333, which is not an integer or even.\n\nSo, it's possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 24/7 or approximately 3.4286.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a decimal answer. Let's see what 24 divided by 7 is.\n\n24 divided by 7 is approximately 3.428571..., which can be rounded to 3.43.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the form of the answer, perhaps giving it as a fraction is better.\n\nSo, the average number of people per house is 24/7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me consider that all houses have the same even number of people.\n\nIf that's the case, then let's denote the number of people per house as x, which is an even integer.\n\nThen, total people would be 35x = 120.\n\nSo, x = 120 / 35 = 24/7, which is approximately 3.4286, which is not an integer, contradicting the assumption that x is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the houses cannot all have the same number of people; some must have more than others.\n\nBut the problem states that each house has an even number of people, but not necessarily the same number.\n\nSo, in that case, the average is still 120 / 35 = 24/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find the average number of people per house, given that each house has an even number of people.\n\nBut mathematically, the average is still total people divided by total houses, regardless of the constraints on the individual houses.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains 24/7.\n\nMaybe to confirm, let's think of a scenario where it's possible.\n\nSuppose 35 houses, each with 4 people: total would be 140, which is more than 120.\n\nAlternatively, if each house has 2 people: total would be 70, which is less than 120.\n\nSo, some houses must have more than 2 and some less than 4, but since the number must be even, the only even numbers possible are 2, 4, 6, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps some houses have 2, some have 4, some have 6, etc.\n\nLet's assume that some houses have 2 and some have 4.\n\nLet\u2019s say x houses have 2 people and y houses have 4 people.\n\nThen, x + y = 35, and 2x + 4y = 120.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom the first equation, x = 35 - y.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation: 2(35 - y) + 4y = 120.\n\nThat's 70 - 2y + 4y = 120 \u21d2 70 + 2y = 120 \u21d2 2y = 50 \u21d2 y = 25.\n\nThen, x = 35 - 25 = 10.\n\nSo, 10 houses have 2 people and 25 houses have 4 people.\n\nTotal people: 10*2 + 25*4 = 20 + 100 = 120, which matches.\n\nSo, in this case, the average is indeed 120 / 35 = 24/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are houses with 6 people.\n\nLet\u2019s try another scenario.\n\nSuppose some houses have 2, some have 4, some have 6.\n\nLet\u2019s say x houses have 2, y houses have 4, z houses have 6.\n\nThen, x + y + z = 35, and 2x + 4y + 6z = 120.\n\nThis is a system with two equations and three variables, so it has infinite solutions.\n\nBut for the purpose of finding the average, it's still total people divided by total houses, which is 120 / 35 = 24/7.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the distribution of even numbers across the houses, as long as the total is 120 and there are 35 houses, the average is 24/7.\n\nSo, the final answer is 24/7 people per house on average.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{7}} \\]"
