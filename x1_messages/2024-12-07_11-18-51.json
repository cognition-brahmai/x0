        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria population growth. It says that the bacteria population doubles every hour, and I need to find out how many bacteria there will be after 10 hours, starting with an initial population of 500.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the population to double every hour. That means that every hour, the number of bacteria increases by a factor of 2. So, if I start with 500 bacteria, after one hour, there will be 500 times 2, which is 1000 bacteria. After another hour, that 1000 will double again to 2000, and so on.\n\nThis sounds like exponential growth, where the population at any time is the initial population multiplied by the growth rate raised to the power of the number of time periods. In this case, the growth rate is 2 (doubling), and the time period is hours.\n\nSo, the formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times r^{t} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the population at time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate,\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time in hours.\n\nPlugging in the values from the problem:\n\n- \\( P_0 = 500 \\),\n\n- \\( r = 2 \\),\n\n- \\( t = 10 \\) hours.\n\nSo, the population after 10 hours would be:\n\n\\[ P = 500 \\times 2^{10} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 2^{10} \\). I know that \\( 2^{10} \\) is 1024. So,\n\n\\[ P = 500 \\times 1024 \\]\n\nMultiplying 500 by 1024:\n\n\\[ 500 \\times 1000 = 500,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 500 \\times 24 = 12,000 \\]\n\nAdding those together:\n\n\\[ 500,000 + 12,000 = 512,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, after 10 hours, there will be 512,000 bacteria.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 500 bacteria:\n\n- After 1 hour: 500 \u00d7 2 = 1000\n\n- After 2 hours: 1000 \u00d7 2 = 2000\n\n- After 3 hours: 2000 \u00d7 2 = 4000\n\n- After 4 hours: 4000 \u00d7 2 = 8000\n\n- After 5 hours: 8000 \u00d7 2 = 16,000\n\n- After 6 hours: 16,000 \u00d7 2 = 32,000\n\n- After 7 hours: 32,000 \u00d7 2 = 64,000\n\n- After 8 hours: 64,000 \u00d7 2 = 128,000\n\n- After 9 hours: 128,000 \u00d7 2 = 256,000\n\n- After 10 hours: 256,000 \u00d7 2 = 512,000\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 512,000 bacteria after 10 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of exponents. Since the population doubles every hour, after 10 hours, it would have doubled 10 times, which is multiplying by 2, ten times. That's the same as multiplying by \\( 2^{10} \\), which is 1024, as I calculated before.\n\nSo, the final answer is 512,000 bacteria.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{512000} \\]\n"
