        "content": "So Jane studies 2 hours every day, and we need to find out how much time she spends studying in a school year that has 180 days. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have the daily study time and the number of school days, and we need to find the total study time over the school year.\n\nSo, basically, it's a multiplication problem. If she studies 2 hours each day, and there are 180 days in the school year, then the total time spent studying would be 2 hours multiplied by 180 days.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal study time = daily study time \u00d7 number of school days\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal study time = 2 hours/day \u00d7 180 days\n\nNow, when I multiply 2 by 180, I get:\n\n2 \u00d7 180 = 360\n\nSo, the total study time is 360 hours.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many hours she studies in a week and then multiply by the number of weeks in the school year, but since we're given the total number of school days, it's simpler to multiply daily hours by the total number of school days.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there are any other factors to consider. For example, are there any days off or breaks within the school year that might reduce the number of days she actually studies? But the problem says \"a school year of 180 days,\" so I think that already accounts for the days she is in school and presumably studying.\n\nAlso, it says \"she spends 2 hours studying every day,\" which likely means school days only, given the context of a school year.\n\nSo, no need to adjust for weekends or holidays; the 180 days probably exclude those.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nTotal study time = 2 hours/day \u00d7 180 days = 360 hours\n\nAlternatively, if I want to think about it in terms of weeks, I could calculate how many weeks are in the school year. Assuming a typical school year has about 36 weeks (since 180 days divided by 5 school days per week is 36 weeks), but that's more complicated than necessary for this problem.\n\nStick with the simple multiplication.\n\nSo, the answer is 360 hours.\n\nBut maybe I can double-check that.\n\nLet's see: 2 hours per day for 180 days.\n\n2 \u00d7 180 = 360.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could break it down further.\n\nFor example, maybe calculate how many hours she studies in a week.\n\nIf she studies 2 hours a day for 5 days a week, that's 10 hours per week.\n\nThen, with 36 weeks in a school year, 10 hours/week \u00d7 36 weeks = 360 hours.\n\nWait, but the problem says 180 days, which is typically 36 weeks (180 \u00f7 5 = 36), assuming a 5-day school week.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, I end up with 360 hours.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
