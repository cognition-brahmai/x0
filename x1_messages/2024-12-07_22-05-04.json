        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about buying bags of candy with different discounts for different quantities. It says that one bag costs $4, two bags cost $7, and three bags cost $9. I need to find out how much it would cost to buy five bags.\n\nFirst, I should understand the pricing structure. It seems like there are discounts when buying multiple bags:\n\n- 1 bag: $4\n\n- 2 bags: $7 (which is less than $8 if buying two at $4 each)\n\n- 3 bags: $9 (which is less than $12 if buying three at $4 each)\n\nSo, buying in larger quantities saves money.\n\nNow, I need to buy five bags. Since there are different pricing options, I should figure out the combination of 1-, 2-, or 3-bag packs that adds up to five bags and costs the least.\n\nLet me think about the possible combinations:\n\n1. Buy one 3-bag pack and two 1-bag packs:\n\n- 3 bags: $9\n\n- 1 bag: $4\n\n- Another 1 bag: $4\n\n- Total: $9 + $4 + $4 = $17\n\n2. Buy two 2-bag packs and one 1-bag pack:\n\n- 2 bags: $7\n\n- Another 2 bags: $7\n\n- 1 bag: $4\n\n- Total: $7 + $7 + $4 = $18\n\n3. Buy one 2-bag pack and one 3-bag pack:\n\n- 2 bags: $7\n\n- 3 bags: $9\n\n- Total: $7 + $9 = $16\n\n4. Buy five 1-bag packs:\n\n- 1 bag: $4 each\n\n- Total: 5 * $4 = $20\n\n5. Buy two 3-bag packs and subtract one bag (but I don't think they sell partial bags, so this might not be possible)\n\nWait, buying two 3-bag packs would be 6 bags, which is more than needed. So, that might not be a good option since it's more than five bags.\n\nLooking back at the options, the combination that costs the least is buying one 2-bag pack and one 3-bag pack for a total of $16.\n\nComparing all the options:\n\n- Option 1: $17\n\n- Option 2: $18\n\n- Option 3: $16\n\n- Option 4: $20\n\n- Option 5: not feasible\n\nSo, the cheapest option is $16.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. Is there a combination I'm missing?\n\nLet me consider buying three bags and then two bags:\n\n- 3 bags: $9\n\n- 2 bags: $7\n\n- Total: $16\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr buying two sets of two bags and one bag:\n\n- 2 bags: $7\n\n- 2 bags: $7\n\n- 1 bag: $4\n\n- Total: $18\n\nWhich is more expensive.\n\nAlternatively, buying one set of two bags and three single bags:\n\n- 2 bags: $7\n\n- 1 bag: $4\n\n- 1 bag: $4\n\n- 1 bag: $4\n\n- Total: $7 + $4 + $4 + $4 = $19\n\nWhich is even more expensive.\n\nSo, it seems that the best option is to buy one 2-bag pack and one 3-bag pack for a total of $16.\n\nI think that's the minimum cost for five bags.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
