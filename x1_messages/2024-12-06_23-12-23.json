        "content": "Let's see. They're planning a road trip, and I need to figure out how much they'll spend on gas for the entire trip. Okay, so first, I need to know how much gas they'll use for the trip.\n\nThe car has a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon, and the round-trip distance is 1,200 miles. So, to find out how many gallons of gas they'll need, I can divide the total miles by the miles per gallon.\n\nSo, gallons needed = total miles / miles per gallon.\n\nThat would be 1200 miles / 25 miles per gallon.\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n1200 divided by 25 is 48 gallons.\n\nSo, they'll need 48 gallons of gas for the trip.\n\nNow, gas costs $3.50 per gallon. To find out the total cost, I need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.\n\nTotal cost = gallons needed * cost per gallon.\n\nSo, that's 48 gallons * $3.50 per gallon.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n48 times 3.50.\n\nWell, 48 times 3 is 144, and 48 times 0.5 is 24, so adding those together is 168.\n\nSo, the total cost will be $168.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 1200 miles divided by 25 miles per gallon is indeed 48 gallons.\n\nThen, 48 gallons times $3.50 per gallon.\n\nYes, 48 * 3.50 is 168.\n\nSo, they will spend $168 on gas for the entire trip.\n\nBut, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect this.\n\nFor example, is the fuel efficiency likely to change under different driving conditions? Maybe, but since they've provided a fixed fuel efficiency, I'll assume it's constant.\n\nAlso, are there any tax implications or different gas prices at different stops? But since they've given a flat rate of $3.50 per gallon, I'll use that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the car has a certain tank size, and they need to make stops to refuel. But since the question doesn't ask about that, I don't need to worry about it.\n\nSo, my final answer is $168.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{168} \\]"
