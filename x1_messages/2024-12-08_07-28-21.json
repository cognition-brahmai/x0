        "content": "So I've got this question about probabilities with a standard deck of playing cards. Let's see what it's asking. There are 52 cards in total, divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. The question wants to know the probability of drawing one card at random that's a face card, which are the jack, queen, or king.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability means in this context. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing a face card, and the total possible outcomes are drawing any card from the deck.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many face cards are in the deck. Face cards are jacks, queens, and kings. Each suit has one jack, one queen, and one king. Since there are four suits, that means there are 4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings. So, total face cards would be 4 + 4 + 4, which is 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each suit has 3 face cards: jack, queen, and king. So, 4 suits times 3 face cards per suit equals 12 face cards in total. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the total number of possible outcomes is 52, since there are 52 cards in the deck.\n\nSo, the probability P of drawing a face card is P = number of face cards / total number of cards = 12 / 52.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives me 3 / 13.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/13.\n\nBut maybe I should also express that as a decimal or a percentage for better understanding. Let's see, 3 divided by 13 is approximately 0.2308, which is about 23.08%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 23.08% chance of drawing a face card from a standard deck.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's see, there are 12 face cards out of 52, which is indeed about 23.08%. It seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm? Maybe by considering the probability of not drawing a face card and then subtracting that from 1.\n\nSo, the probability of not drawing a face card would be the number of non-face cards divided by total cards. Non-face cards are 52 - 12 = 40. So, P(not face card) = 40 / 52 = 10 / 13.\n\nThen, P(face card) = 1 - P(not face card) = 1 - 10/13 = 3/13, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGreat, so that confirms that 3/13 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Is the deck shuffled properly? Assuming it's a well-shuffled deck, each card has an equal chance of being drawn, so my calculation should hold.\n\nAlso, since we're drawing only one card, without replacement, the probability remains straightforward. If we were drawing multiple cards, we'd need to consider combinations or conditional probabilities, but in this case, it's just one card.\n\nSo, I think 3/13 is the final answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's think about it in terms of suits. Each suit has 3 face cards, and there are 4 suits, so 4 * 3 = 12 face cards. Total cards are 52, so 12/52 = 3/13. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each suit has the same number of face cards, I could calculate the probability for one suit and then multiply by the number of suits. But since the suits are identical in this context, it's unnecessary.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The probability of drawing a face card from a standard deck is 3/13, or approximately 23.08%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{13}} \\]"
