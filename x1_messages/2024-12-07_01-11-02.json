        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a subcommittee with specific conditions. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. We have a committee of 3 men and 5 women, and we need to form a subcommittee of 4 people that includes at least 1 man and at least 1 woman. Okay, so the total number of ways to choose 4 people from 8 is pretty straightforward. That's just the combination of 8 choose 4.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that in these 4 people, there's at least one man and one woman. So, I can't have all men or all women in the subcommittee. Since there are only 3 men, it's impossible to have a subcommittee of 4 men because there aren't enough men. So, I don't have to worry about the all-men subcommittee. But I do need to make sure that I don't count the all-women subcommittees.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of ways to choose any 4 people from the 8. That's C(8,4). Then, I'll subtract the number of ways to choose 4 women from the 5 women available, which is C(5,4). That should give me the number of subcommittees with at least one man.\n\nWait, but I also need to ensure that there's at least one woman. However, since there are only 3 men, any subcommittee of 4 people must include at least one woman, because 3 men plus 1 woman make 4 people. So, I don't need to worry about subcommittees with all men because it's impossible to have 4 men when there are only 3 men available.\n\nLet me double-check that. If there are only 3 men, and I need to choose 4 people, then at least one of them has to be a woman. So, all possible subcommittees of 4 people will have at least one woman. Therefore, the only thing I need to exclude is the subcommittees with all women, which would be the ones with 4 women and 0 men.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose any 4 people from 8 is C(8,4). The number of ways to choose 4 women from 5 is C(5,4). Therefore, the number of subcommittees with at least one man and at least one woman is C(8,4) minus C(5,4).\n\nLet me calculate that. C(8,4) is 70, and C(5,4) is 5. So, 70 minus 5 is 65.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that sometimes these problems can be approached in different ways, and it's good to verify the answer using another method to make sure I haven't missed something.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the different possible distributions of men and women in the subcommittee. Since there must be at least one man and at least one woman, the possible scenarios are:\n\n- 1 man and 3 women\n\n- 2 men and 2 women\n\n- 3 men and 1 woman\n\nThat's all the possible combinations where there's at least one of each.\n\nSo, I can calculate the number of ways for each scenario and then add them up.\n\nFirst, 1 man and 3 women:\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 man from 3 is C(3,1), and the number of ways to choose 3 women from 5 is C(5,3). So, the total for this scenario is C(3,1) times C(5,3).\n\nSimilarly, for 2 men and 2 women:\n\nC(3,2) times C(5,2).\n\nAnd for 3 men and 1 woman:\n\nC(3,3) times C(5,1).\n\nLet me calculate each of these.\n\nFirst scenario: C(3,1) = 3, C(5,3) = 10, so 3 times 10 is 30.\n\nSecond scenario: C(3,2) = 3, C(5,2) = 10, so 3 times 10 is 30.\n\nThird scenario: C(3,3) = 1, C(5,1) = 5, so 1 times 5 is 5.\n\nNow, adding them up: 30 + 30 + 5 = 65.\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier result. So, that gives me more confidence that 65 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any overlap or if I've counted anything extra.\n\nIn the first method, I took the total number of subcommittees minus the all-women subcommittees. In the second method, I directly added up the subcommittees with the required mix. Both methods gave me 65, which is consistent.\n\nI don't think I've missed any possibilities. The only possible subcommittees are those with at least one man and at least one woman, and I've accounted for all combinations that satisfy that condition.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]"
