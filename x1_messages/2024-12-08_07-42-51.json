Let's create a simple Python command-line application that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion.\n\nFirst, what is a factorial? The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In the case of factorial, n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)! and we know that 1! = 1 and 0! = 1.\n\nSo, we can define a recursive function in Python to calculate the factorial. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Define a function, say `factorial`, that takes an integer `n` as its argument.\n2. Inside the function, check if `n` is 0 or 1. If it is, return 1 because 0! and 1! are both 1.\n3. If `n` is greater than 1, return `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.\n4. Handle the case where a negative integer is provided since factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\nAlso, since this is a command-line application, you'll need to get input from the user and display the result accordingly.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n- Read the input from the command line.\n- Convert the input to an integer.\n- Check if the input is a non-negative integer.\n- If it is, calculate the factorial using recursion and display the result.\n- If not, inform the user to enter a valid non-negative integer.\n\nNow, let's think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the user enters a negative number?\n- What if the user enters something that's not an integer?\n- What about large numbers where recursion might cause a stack overflow?\n\nFor now, we'll assume the user enters a non-negative integer and handle the recursion accordingly. In Python, the maximum recursion depth is around 1000, so for very large numbers, you might hit a RecursionError. To handle large numbers, you could increase the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit()`, but it's generally better to use an iterative approach for large factorials to avoid stack overflow.\n\nBut since the task is to use recursion, we'll proceed with that.\n\nLet's start by writing the recursive function for factorial.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python command-line application that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Factorial Calculation using Recursion**:\n   - The factorial of a non-negative integer \\( n \\) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \\( n \\). It is denoted by \\( n! \\).\n   - Recursively, \\( n! = n \\times (n-1)! \\) with base cases \\( 0! = 1 \\) and \\( 1! = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Command-Line Interaction**:\n   - Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n   - Read and validate the input to ensure it is a non-negative integer.\n   - Compute the factorial using the recursive function.\n   - Display the result.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle inputs 0 and 1 directly since their factorials are 1.\n   - Ensure that negative inputs and non-integer values are managed appropriately.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Get input from the user\n        input_str = input(\"Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial: \")\n        # Convert input to integer\n        n = int(input_str)\n        if n < 0:\n            print(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers. Please enter a non-negative integer.\")\n        else:\n            # Calculate factorial using recursion\n            result = factorial(n)\n            print(f\"The factorial of {n} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Recursive Function**:\n   - `factorial(n)`: Computes the factorial of \\( n \\) using recursion.\n   - Base case: If \\( n \\) is 0 or 1, return 1.\n   - Recursive case: Return \\( n \\) multiplied by the factorial of \\( n-1 \\).\n\n2. **Main Function**:\n   - Prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n   - Reads the input and converts it to an integer.\n   - Checks if the input is negative and provides an appropriate message.\n   - Computes the factorial using the recursive function and displays the result.\n   - Handles invalid inputs (non-integer values) with a `try-except` block.\n\n3. **User Interaction**:\n   - The program ensures that only valid non-negative integers are accepted for factorial calculation.\n   - Provides clear messages for invalid inputs and edge cases.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program is user-friendly and handles various input scenarios effectively."
