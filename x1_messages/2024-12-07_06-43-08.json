        "content": "Alright, so I need to figure out what the theory of relativity is and how it's impacted modern physics. That sounds like a pretty big topic, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by understanding what the theory of relativity is. I think it's something to do with Einstein, but I'm not sure about the details. So, maybe I can use the Yandex search tool to look up \"theory of relativity\" and get some basic information.\n\nPlan: Use Yandex to search for \"theory of relativity\".\n\n#I1 = Yandex[\"theory of relativity\"]\n\nOkay, so after getting the search results from Yandex, I need to figure out which links are most relevant. There might be a lot of results, so I should pick the ones that seem most authoritative, like from educational websites or well-known science sources.\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the Yandex search results.\n\n#I2 = LinkLocator[#I1]\n\nNow, with these links, I should visit them to get more information. Maybe some of them are articles or explanations that can help me understand the theory better.\n\nPlan: Retrieve the content from the selected links.\n\n#I3 = WebsiteRetriever[#I2]\n\nAlright, so now I have the content from these links. I need to read through them and summarize what the theory of relativity is. It might be helpful to note down key points, like what it consists of\u2014maybe special relativity and general relativity\u2014and what each part is about.\n\nAlso, I should think about how it's impacted modern physics. Maybe it's changed the way we understand space and time, or it's important for technologies like GPS, which I've heard somewhere.\n\nPlan: Summarize the theory of relativity from the retrieved website content.\n\n#I4 = InfoBank[\"theory of relativity summary\"]\n\nWait, actually, maybe I can use the InfoBank tool to get a concise summary of the theory of relativity. That might save time and give me accurate information.\n\nPlan: Use InfoBank to get a summary of the theory of relativity.\n\n#I4 = InfoBank[\"theory of relativity\"]\n\nOkay, so with this summary, I should have a basic understanding. Now, I need to look into its impacts on modern physics. Maybe I can search for \"impact of relativity on modern physics\" or something similar.\n\nPlan: Use Yandex to search for \"impact of relativity on modern physics\".\n\n#I5 = Yandex[\"impact of relativity on modern physics\"]\n\nThen, extract the relevant links from these search results.\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the Yandex search results.\n\n#I6 = LinkLocator[#I5]\n\nAnd retrieve the content from those links.\n\nPlan: Retrieve the content from the selected links.\n\n#I7 = WebsiteRetriever[#I6]\n\nNow, I need to go through this content and identify key impacts. Perhaps relativity is crucial for understanding cosmic phenomena, or it has led to developments in quantum physics, or it's essential for technologies that rely on precise time measurements.\n\nPlan: Summarize the impacts of relativity on modern physics from the retrieved website content.\n\n#I8 = InfoBank[\"impacts of relativity on modern physics\"]\n\nAgain, maybe using InfoBank to get a summary of the impacts would be efficient.\n\nPlan: Use InfoBank to get a summary of the impacts of relativity on modern physics.\n\n#I8 = InfoBank[\"impacts of relativity on modern physics\"]\n\nNow, with both the theory and its impacts summarized, I should be able to formulate a comprehensive answer to the user's question.\n\nPlan: Combine the summaries of the theory of relativity and its impacts on modern physics to answer the user's question.\n\n#I9 = ProblemSolver[\"What is the theory of relativity and how has it impacted modern physics? Given #I4 and #I8.\"]\n\nWait, maybe I should frame it better. I need to make sure that the question-answering model has all the necessary information.\n\nPlan: Formulate a question that incorporates the summaries and asks for an explanation.\n\n#I9 = ProblemSolver[\"Based on #I4 and #I8, can you explain what the theory of relativity is and provide an overview of its significance in modern physics?\"]\n\nThat should do it. Now, the ProblemSolver should be able to integrate the information from #I4 and #I8 to give a detailed answer.\n\nFinal Resolution: #I9"
