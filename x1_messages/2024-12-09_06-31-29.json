        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many units the factory produces in a week. It produces 250 units every day for 6 days, so weekly production is 250 units/day * 6 days/week. Then, to find the monthly production, we'll multiply the weekly production by 4, since there are 4 weeks in a month. Finally, since each unit sells for $35, we'll multiply the total monthly production by $35 to get the total revenue. Let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, weekly production: 250 units/day * 6 days/week = 1500 units/week.\n\nThen, monthly production: 1500 units/week * 4 weeks/month = 6000 units/month.\n\nNow, total revenue: 6000 units/month * $35/unit = $210,000/month.\n\nSo, the factory generates a total revenue of $210,000 in one month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210000} \\]"
