        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular garden that's 50 meters long and 30 meters wide, and it's surrounded by a path of uniform width. The area of just the path is 600 square meters, and we need to find out what the width of that path is.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. There's a rectangle that represents the garden, and around it, there's a path that has the same width all around. So, if I imagine the garden and the path together, they form a larger rectangle.\n\nLet's denote the width of the path as \\( w \\) meters. Since the path goes all around the garden, the length of the entire area (garden plus path) would be the garden's length plus twice the path's width (because the path is on both sides of the length). So, the total length is \\( 50 + 2w \\) meters. Similarly, the total width would be \\( 30 + 2w \\) meters.\n\nNow, the area of the entire rectangle (garden plus path) is \\( (50 + 2w) \\times (30 + 2w) \\) square meters.\n\nThe area of just the garden is \\( 50 \\times 30 = 1500 \\) square meters.\n\nThe area of the path itself is the difference between the area of the entire rectangle and the area of the garden. According to the problem, this area is 600 square meters. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n(50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n\\[\n(50 \\times 30) + (50 \\times 2w) + (30 \\times 2w) + (2w \\times 2w) - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1500 + 100w + 60w + 4w^2 - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 + 160w = 600\n\\]\n\nI can divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w = 150\n\\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\( w \\), I need to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and I can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{ 2a }\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 40 \\), and \\( c = -150 \\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 \\pm \\sqrt{40^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-150)} }{ 2 \\times 1 }\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 + 600} }{ 2 }\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 \\pm \\sqrt{2200} }{ 2 }\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 \\pm 46.90 }{ 2 }\n\\]\n\nFirst, taking the positive root:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 + 46.90 }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 6.90 }{ 2 } = 3.45 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nAnd the negative root:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 - 46.90 }{ 2 } = \\frac{ -86.90 }{ 2 } = -43.45 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSince width cannot be negative, the width of the path is 3.45 meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\n\\[\n(50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n1500 + 100w + 60w + 4w^2 - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 + 160w = 600\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w = 150\n\\]\n\nSetting to zero:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 + 600} }{ 2 } = \\frac{ -40 \\pm \\sqrt{2200} }{ 2 }\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2200} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 22} = 10\\sqrt{22} \\approx 46.90\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 + 46.90 }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 6.90 }{ 2 } = 3.45 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nAnd the negative root is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps by considering the perimeter or something else.\n\nLet's try another method. The area of the path is 600 square meters, and the garden is 50m by 30m.\n\nThe path surrounds the garden, so it forms a frame around it. The area of the path would be the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the garden.\n\nSo, area of path = area of larger rectangle - area of garden = 600\n\nWe already used this approach and got \\( w = 3.45 \\) meters.\n\nMaybe I can verify this by plugging the value back into the original equation.\n\nLet \\( w = 3.45 \\) meters.\n\nThen, total length = 50 + 2(3.45) = 50 + 6.9 = 56.9 meters\n\nTotal width = 30 + 2(3.45) = 30 + 6.9 = 36.9 meters\n\nArea of larger rectangle = 56.9 * 36.9 \u2248 2090.61 square meters\n\nArea of garden = 50 * 30 = 1500 square meters\n\nArea of path = 2090.61 - 1500 = 590.61 square meters\n\nHmm, that's not exactly 600 square meters. Maybe I made a rounding error.\n\nLet me calculate it more precisely.\n\n\\( w = 3.45 \\) meters\n\nTotal length = 50 + 2(3.45) = 50 + 6.9 = 56.9 meters\n\nTotal width = 30 + 2(3.45) = 30 + 6.9 = 36.9 meters\n\nArea of larger rectangle = 56.9 * 36.9 = 2090.61 square meters\n\nArea of garden = 1500 square meters\n\nArea of path = 2090.61 - 1500 = 590.61 square meters\n\nThe problem states the area of the path is 600 square meters, but my calculation gives 590.61 square meters. There's a discrepancy of about 9.39 square meters, which might be due to rounding \\( \\sqrt{2200} \\) to 46.90.\n\nLet me calculate \\( \\sqrt{2200} \\) more accurately.\n\n\\( \\sqrt{2200} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 22} = 10\\sqrt{22} \\)\n\n\\( \\sqrt{22} \\approx 4.69041575982343 \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\sqrt{2200} \\approx 46.9041575982343 \\)\n\nUsing this more precise value:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ -40 + 46.9041575982343 }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 6.9041575982343 }{ 2 } = 3.45207879911715 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nLet's use this more precise value to recalculate the area.\n\nTotal length = 50 + 2(3.45207879911715) = 50 + 6.9041575982343 = 56.9041575982343 meters\n\nTotal width = 30 + 2(3.45207879911715) = 30 + 6.9041575982343 = 36.9041575982343 meters\n\nArea of larger rectangle = 56.9041575982343 * 36.9041575982343 \u2248 2099.9999999999995 square meters (which is essentially 2100 square meters)\n\nArea of garden = 1500 square meters\n\nArea of path = 2100 - 1500 = 600 square meters\n\nPerfect, that matches the given area of the path. So, the width of the path is approximately 3.45 meters.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used \\( w = 3.45 \\) meters, I got 590.61 square meters for the path area, which is not 600. But with the more precise value of \\( w = 3.45207879911715 \\) meters, the area comes out to be exactly 600 square meters.\n\nThis suggests that the approximation of \\( \\sqrt{2200} \\) as 46.90 led to a slight inaccuracy. Therefore, the exact width is \\( w = \\frac{ -40 + \\sqrt{2200} }{ 2 } \\) meters.\n\nBut for practical purposes, \\( w \\approx 3.45 \\) meters is acceptable, considering rounding errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solve this problem that might yield a more straightforward answer.\n\nLet's consider the area of the path. The path surrounds the garden and has a uniform width \\( w \\). The garden is 50m by 30m.\n\nThe path consists of two parts: the strips along the length and the strips along the width.\n\nSpecifically, there are two strips along the length, each of area \\( 50 \\times w \\), and two strips along the width, each of area \\( 30 \\times w \\). However, this counts the corners twice, so I need to subtract the areas of the four corner squares, each of area \\( w \\times w \\).\n\nSo, the total area of the path is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (50w) + 2 \\times (30w) - 4w^2 = 100w + 60w - 4w^2 = 160w - 4w^2\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this area is 600 square meters:\n\n\\[\n160w - 4w^2 = 600\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\n-4w^2 + 160w - 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying by -1 to make it easier:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 - 160w + 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 - 40w + 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, this is different from the earlier equation I had. Previously, I had \\( w^2 + 40w - 150 = 0 \\), but now it's \\( w^2 - 40w + 150 = 0 \\). There's a sign difference.\n\nLet me check where I went wrong.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\n\\[\n(50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n1500 + 100w + 60w + 4w^2 - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 + 160w = 600\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w = 150\n\\]\n\nSetting to zero:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nIn the second approach:\n\nArea of path = \\( 160w - 4w^2 = 600 \\)\n\nRearranged to:\n\n\\[\n-4w^2 + 160w - 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying by -1:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 - 160w + 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 - 40w + 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, there's a contradiction here. Two different equations from the same problem. That means I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nLet me double-check the second approach.\n\nThe path surrounds the garden, so the total area including the path is \\( (50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) \\), and the area of the garden is 1500 square meters. So, the area of the path is:\n\n\\[\n(50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIn the second approach, considering the strips:\n\n- Two lengths: \\( 50 \\times w \\) each, so \\( 2 \\times 50w = 100w \\)\n\n- Two widths: \\( 30 \\times w \\) each, so \\( 2 \\times 30w = 60w \\)\n\n- But the corners are counted twice, so subtract \\( 4 \\times w^2 = 4w^2 \\)\n\nSo, total path area:\n\n\\[\n100w + 60w - 4w^2 = 160w - 4w^2\n\\]\n\nSet equal to 600:\n\n\\[\n160w - 4w^2 = 600\n\\]\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\[\n-4w^2 + 160w - 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying by -1:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 - 160w + 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 - 40w + 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut this contradicts the first equation \\( w^2 + 40w - 150 = 0 \\). There's clearly a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the second approach. Let's think differently.\n\nThe path surrounds the garden, so the area of the path can be thought of as the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the garden.\n\nThat is:\n\n\\[\n(50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 + 160w - 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, considering the strips:\n\n- The path along the length: two strips of \\( 50 \\times w \\)\n\n- The path along the width: two strips of \\( 30 \\times w \\)\n\n- However, the corners are overlapping, so we need to subtract the areas of the corners.\n\nBut actually, the corners are squares of \\( w \\times w \\), and since each corner is part of both a length strip and a width strip, we've double-counted them. Therefore, we need to subtract the areas of the four corners.\n\nSo, total path area:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 50w + 2 \\times 30w - 4 \\times w^2 = 100w + 60w - 4w^2 = 160w - 4w^2\n\\]\n\nSet equal to 600:\n\n\\[\n160w - 4w^2 = 600\n\\]\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\[\n-4w^2 + 160w - 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying by -1:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 - 160w + 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 - 40w + 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, this is inconsistent with the first equation. There must be an error in the second approach.\n\nLet me see: the first approach is straightforward and seems correct. The second approach might be flawed because perhaps the way I'm accounting for the corners is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the path as consisting of a large rectangle minus the garden rectangle.\n\nWait, that's what I did in the first approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the path as consisting of four rectangles: two along the length and two along the width, minus the four corner squares.\n\nBut this seems similar to what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the perimeter of the garden and multiply by the width of the path to get the area, but that wouldn't account for the corners properly.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is \\( 2 \\times (50 + 30) = 160 \\) meters.\n\nIf I multiply the perimeter by the width \\( w \\), I get \\( 160w \\) square meters, but this counts the corners twice, so I need to subtract the areas of the four corners, which are \\( 4w^2 \\).\n\nSo, area of path = \\( 160w - 4w^2 \\)\n\nSet equal to 600:\n\n\\[\n160w - 4w^2 = 600\n\\]\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\[\n-4w^2 + 160w - 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying by -1:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 - 160w + 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 - 40w + 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is the same as before, which contradicts the first equation.\n\nBut the first equation was:\n\n\\[\n(50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n1500 + 100w + 60w + 4w^2 - 1500 = 600\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 + 160w = 600\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w = 150\n\\]\n\nSetting to zero:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 40w - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, there must be a mistake in the second approach.\n\nLet me solve \\( w^2 - 40w + 150 = 0 \\) and see what I get.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ 40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 - 600} }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 40 \\pm \\sqrt{1000} }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 40 \\pm 31.62 }{ 2 }\n\\]\n\nFirst root:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ 40 + 31.62 }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 71.62 }{ 2 } = 35.81 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSecond root:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{ 40 - 31.62 }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 8.38 }{ 2 } = 4.19 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNow, both these values are different from the 3.45 meters I got earlier.\n\nBut when I plugged \\( w = 3.45 \\) meters into the first equation, it almost gave me the correct area, with a slight discrepancy due to rounding.\n\nHowever, using \\( w = 4.19 \\) meters in the first approach:\n\nTotal length = 50 + 2(4.19) = 50 + 8.38 = 58.38 meters\n\nTotal width = 30 + 2(4.19) = 30 + 8.38 = 38.38 meters\n\nArea of larger rectangle = 58.38 * 38.38 \u2248 2240.02 square meters\n\nArea of garden = 1500 square meters\n\nArea of path = 2240.02 - 1500 = 740.02 square meters\n\nBut the problem states the path area is 600 square meters, and 740.02 is not equal to 600, so this value is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, \\( w = 35.81 \\) meters:\n\nTotal length = 50 + 2(35.81) = 50 + 71.62 = 121.62 meters\n\nTotal width = 30 + 2(35.81) = 30 + 71.62 = 101.62 meters\n\nArea of larger rectangle = 121.62 * 101.62 \u2248 12355.58 square meters\n\nArea of garden = 1500 square meters\n\nArea of path = 12355.58 - 1500 = 10855.58 square meters\n\nThis is way off from 600 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the second approach is giving incorrect results, which means there must be a mistake in that approach.\n\nHence, the first approach is the correct one, and the width of the path is approximately 3.45 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up the equation differently to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the width of the path as \\( w \\).\n\nThe dimensions of the entire area (garden plus path) are:\n\nLength: \\( 50 + 2w \\)\n\nWidth: \\( 30 + 2w \\)\n\nArea of the entire area: \\( (50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) \\)\n\nArea of the garden: \\( 50 \\times 30 = 1500 \\) square meters\n\nArea of the path: \\( (50 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1500 = 600 \\)\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\( 1500 + 100w + 60w + 4w^2 - 1500 = 600 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( 4w^2 + 160w = 600 \\)\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\( w^2 + 40w = 150 \\)\n\nSetting to zero:\n\n\\( w^2 + 40w - 150 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation:\n\n\\( w = \\frac{ -40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 + 600} }{ 2 } = \\frac{ -40 \\pm \\sqrt{2200} }{ 2 } \\)\n\n\\( \\sqrt{2200} = 10\\sqrt{22} \\approx 46.90 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( w = \\frac{ -40 + 46.90 }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 6.90 }{ 2 } = 3.45 \\) meters\n\nAnd the negative root is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the width of the path is approximately 3.45 meters.\n\nTo confirm, let's calculate the area with \\( w = 3.45 \\) meters.\n\nTotal length: 50 + 2(3.45) = 56.9 meters\n\nTotal width: 30 + 2(3.45) = 36.9 meters\n\nArea of larger rectangle: 56.9 * 36.9 \u2248 2090.61 square meters\n\nArea of garden: 1500 square meters\n\nArea of path: 2090.61 - 1500 = 590.61 square meters\n\nThere's a slight discrepancy from 600 square meters, likely due to rounding \\( \\sqrt{2200} \\) to 46.90.\n\nUsing a more precise value for \\( \\sqrt{2200} \\):\n\n\\( \\sqrt{2200} = 46.9041575982343 \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\( w = \\frac{ -40 + 46.9041575982343 }{ 2 } = \\frac{ 6.9041575982343 }{ 2 } = 3.45207879911715 \\) meters\n\nUsing this value:\n\nTotal length: 50 + 2(3.45207879911715) = 56.9041575982343 meters\n\nTotal width: 30 + 2(3.45207879911715) = 36.9041575982343 meters\n\nArea of larger rectangle: 56.9041575982343 * 36.9041575982343 \u2248 2100 square meters\n\nArea of garden: 1500 square meters\n\nArea of path: 2100 -
