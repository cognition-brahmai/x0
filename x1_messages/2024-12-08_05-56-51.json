        "content": "So there's a class with 25 students in total, and out of those, 12 are boys. You want to find out what percentage of the class are girls. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to figure out how many girls there are in the class. Since the total number of students is 25 and there are 12 boys, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to get the number of girls.\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys\nNumber of girls = 25 - 12\nNumber of girls = 13\n\nSo, there are 13 girls in the class.\n\nNext, to find out what percentage of the class are girls, we need to express the number of girls as a percentage of the total number of students. The formula for percentage is:\n\nPercentage = (Part / Whole) * 100\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of girls, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage of girls = (13 / 25) * 100\n\nNow, let's do the division first:\n\n13 divided by 25 is 0.52\n\nThen, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.52 * 100 = 52%\n\nTherefore, 52% of the class are girls.\n\nTo double-check, we can also calculate the percentage of boys and see if both percentages add up to 100%. Number of boys is 12, so:\n\nPercentage of boys = (12 / 25) * 100\nPercentage of boys = 0.48 * 100\nPercentage of boys = 48%\n\nNow, adding the percentages of boys and girls:\n\n52% + 48% = 100%\n\nIt checks out. So, the answer is 52%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52\\%} \\]"
