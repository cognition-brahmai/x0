        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and it's said to be 3 times longer than it is wide. Also, the perimeter is 48 meters. We need to find its dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n1. The garden is rectangular.\n\n2. Its length is 3 times its width.\n\n3. The perimeter is 48 meters.\n\nNow, for a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nGiven that the length is 3 times the width, we can express the length in terms of the width:\n\n\\[ l = 3w \\]\n\nNow, substituting this into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2(3w) + 2w \\]\n\nAnd we know the perimeter is 48 meters:\n\n\\[ 2(3w) + 2w = 48 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this equation:\n\n\\[ 6w + 2w = 48 \\]\n\n\\[ 8w = 48 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{48}{8} \\]\n\n\\[ w = 6 \\] meters\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length using the relationship \\( l = 3w \\):\n\n\\[ l = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\] meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 18 meters in length and 6 meters in width.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it's correct. If the length is 18 meters and the width is 6 meters, the perimeter should be:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times 18 + 2 \\times 6 = 36 + 12 = 48 \\] meters\n\nYes, that matches the given perimeter. Also, the length is indeed 3 times the width, since 18 is 3 times 6. So, our solution seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might get confused with the terms \"longer\" and \"wider,\" but in this case, it's clearly stated that the garden is 3 times longer than it is wide, which means length is 3 times the width.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use variables for both length and width and set up equations based on the given information.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- width = \\( w \\)\n\n- length = \\( l = 3w \\)\n\nThen, the perimeter equation is:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2w = 48 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 2(3w) + 2w = 48 \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 6w + 2w = 48 \\]\n\n\\[ 8w = 48 \\]\n\n\\[ w = 6 \\] meters\n\nAnd then \\( l = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\) meters\n\nSame result as before.\n\nSometimes, students might make mistakes by misinterpreting the relationship between length and width. For example, they might think that \"3 times longer\" means \\( l = 4w \\), because they include the original width in the increase. But in standard mathematical terms, \"3 times longer than\" means \\( l = 3w \\), not \\( l = w + 3w = 4w \\). It's important to be clear on this point.\n\nAlso, it's good to note that the perimeter formula is specific to rectangles. If the shape were different, the formula would change accordingly.\n\nIn real-life applications, knowing the dimensions of a garden can help in planning how to use the space, such as deciding where to plant different types of plants or how much fencing is needed.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the garden has a width of 6 meters and a length of 18 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{width } = 6 \\text{ meters}, \\text{ length } = 18 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
