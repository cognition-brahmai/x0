By definition, a moon is a natural satellite that orbits a planet or another celestial body like a dwarf planet or an asteroid. So, yes, all moons are moons by definition. But perhaps you're asking something else? Maybe you're wondering if all celestial bodies that orbit planets are called moons, or if there are exceptions? Please clarify your question if you need more specific information."
