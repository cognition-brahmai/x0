        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 apples in the basket to start with. If I remove half of them, that means I'm taking away 6 apples because half of 12 is 6. So, after removing 6 apples, there should be 6 apples left in the basket.\n\nThen, I put back 2 apples. So, I'm adding 2 apples back to the 6 that are already there. That should make 6 plus 2, which equals 8 apples.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Starting with 12 apples, remove half, which is 6, leaving 6 apples. Then, put back 2 apples, so 6 plus 2 equals 8.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 8 apples left in the basket.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if \"remove half of them\" means exactly half, or if it could be interpreted differently. In mathematics, \"half\" typically means dividing by 2, so half of 12 is indeed 6.\n\nAlternatively, if there's any ambiguity in the wording, perhaps \"remove half of them\" could mean removing half of the total, which is 6, and then putting back 2. But no, that seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apples that are put back are among those that were removed, but the problem says \"put back 2 apples,\" which could be from another source or from the ones removed. But since it doesn't specify, I think the assumption is that you put back 2 apples, regardless of where they come from.\n\nSo, in any case, the number should be 8 apples left in the basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
