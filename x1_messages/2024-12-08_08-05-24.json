        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem here. A store sells apples for $1 each and oranges for $2 each. A customer buys 10 fruits in total and spends exactly $15. We need to find out how many apples they bought.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have two types of fruits: apples and oranges. Apples cost $1 each, and oranges cost $2 each. The customer buys a total of 10 fruits and spends $15. We need to find out how many apples are in that batch of 10 fruits.\n\nAlright, so maybe I can set up some equations here. Let's define variables to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let A be the number of apples.\n\n- Let O be the number of oranges.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 10. So, A + O = 10.\n\n2. The total cost is $15. Since apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each, the cost equation would be 1*A + 2*O = 15.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. A + O = 10\n\n2. A + 2O = 15\n\nHmm, okay. I need to solve these two equations together to find the values of A and O.\n\nLet me see. Maybe I can use the first equation to express one variable in terms of the other. For example, from the first equation, A = 10 - O.\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for A into the second equation.\n\nSo, substituting A = 10 - O into the second equation:\n\n(10 - O) + 2O = 15\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n10 - O + 2O = 15\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n10 + O = 15\n\nNow, subtract 10 from both sides:\n\nO = 5\n\nSo, the number of oranges is 5.\n\nNow, plug this back into the first equation to find A:\n\nA + 5 = 10\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\nA = 5\n\nSo, the customer bought 5 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf A = 5 and O = 5, then the total cost would be 1*5 + 2*5 = 5 + 10 = 15, which matches the total spent. And the total fruits are 5 + 5 = 10, which also matches. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's see if there are other possible solutions. Maybe there's another combination of A and O that satisfies both equations.\n\nLet me try A = 4. Then, O would be 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nNow, check the cost: 1*4 + 2*6 = 4 + 12 = 16, which is more than 15. So, that doesn't work.\n\nWhat about A = 6? Then O = 4.\n\nCost: 1*6 + 2*4 = 6 + 8 = 14, which is less than 15.\n\nSo, A = 5 is the only solution that gives exactly $15.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this using algebraic methods or even by testing different values, but the substitution method worked pretty well here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the average cost per fruit. Total spent is $15 for 10 fruits, so average cost per fruit is $1.50.\n\nSince apples are $1 and oranges are $2, the average being $1.50 suggests an equal number of apples and oranges, which in this case is A = 5 and O = 5.\n\nBut, to be honest, I think the equation method is more reliable, especially for more complex problems.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the customer bought 5 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
