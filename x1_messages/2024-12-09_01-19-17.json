        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 15 men and 10 women in a group, and we're supposed to find the probability of selecting 6 people at random with an equal number of men and women. Equal number means there should be 3 men and 3 women in the selected group.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of ways to select 6 people from the group. The group has 15 men and 10 women, so the total number of people is 15 + 10 = 25. Since the order in which we select the people doesn't matter, I should use combinations instead of permutations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 6 people from 25 is C(25, 6). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(25, 6) = 25! / (6! * (25 - 6)!) = (25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 21 \u00d7 20) / (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 177100.\n\nOkay, so there are 177,100 different ways to choose 6 people from 25.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to choose 3 men from 15 and 3 women from 10.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose 3 men from 15 is C(15, 3):\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3! * (15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nNext, the number of ways to choose 3 women from 10 is C(10, 3):\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 120.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 3 men and 3 women, I multiply these two combinations together because these are independent events:\n\nNumber of favorable ways = C(15, 3) \u00d7 C(10, 3) = 455 \u00d7 120 = 54,600.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable ways / Total number of ways = 54,600 / 177,100.\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 100:\n\n= 546 / 1771.\n\nLet me see if this can be simplified further. I'll check if 546 and 1771 have any common factors.\n\nFirst, I'll check if 546 divides into 1771.\n\n546 \u00d7 3 = 1638, which is less than 1771.\n\n546 \u00d7 4 = 2184, which is more than 1771.\n\nSo, 546 doesn't divide into 1771 evenly.\n\nLet me check for common factors. Let's factorize both numbers.\n\nStarting with 546:\n\n546 \u00f7 2 = 273.\n\n273 \u00f7 3 = 91.\n\n91 \u00f7 7 = 13.\n\nSo, 546 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13.\n\nNow, 1771:\n\n1771 \u00f7 7 = 253.\n\n253 \u00f7 11 = 23.\n\nSo, 1771 = 7 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 23.\n\nCommon factor is 7.\n\nSo, divide both numerator and denominator by 7:\n\n546 \u00f7 7 = 78.\n\n1771 \u00f7 7 = 253.\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 78 / 253.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 78/253.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n78 divided by 253 is approximately 0.3083.\n\nSo, the probability is roughly 30.83%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form, I'll keep it as a fraction.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal number of ways: C(25, 6) = 177100. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 men: C(15, 3) = 455.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 women: C(10, 3) = 120.\n\nMultiplying them: 455 \u00d7 120 = 54600.\n\nProbability: 54600 / 177100 = 546 / 1771.\n\nSimplifying by dividing by 7: 78 / 253.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting an equal number of men and women (3 each) when choosing 6 people from a group of 15 men and 10 women is 78/253.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{78}{253}} \\]"
