        "content": "In epidemiology, the term 'incidence rate' refers to the number of new cases of a disease in a population over a specific time period. So, the correct answer is A. The incidence rate is a measure of the frequency with which new cases of a disease occur in a population over time. It is usually expressed as a rate per person-time, such as cases per 1,000 person-years. This measure is important because it helps researchers and public health officials understand the risk of developing a disease in a population and track the spread of diseases over time."
