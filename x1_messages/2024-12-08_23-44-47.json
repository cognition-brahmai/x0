According to the 2016 census, approximately 56% of Canadians speak English as their first language, while about 21% speak French as their first language. Additionally, many Canadians are bilingual and can speak both languages. There are also many other languages spoken in Canada due to its diverse population, including Chinese, Punjabi, Spanish, Italian, and many Indigenous languages."
