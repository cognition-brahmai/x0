        "content": "In the realm where frigid winds do blow,\nAnd winter's reign with icy grip doth hold,\nThe flurries fall, a dance upon the flow.\n\nLike souls ascending to the heavens' fold,\nEach flake descends in silent, graceful flight,\nA transient beauty, pure and manifold.\n\nUpon the earth, they paint a scene so white,\nTransforming landscapes into realms of yore,\nWhere time itself seems to stand still in sight.\n\nThe world is hushed, as if in prayer or lore,\nThe snowflakes whisper secrets to the ground,\nOf seasons past and futures yet in store.\n\nIn Dante's shadow, I attempt to sound\nThe depths of this serene and frosty morn,\nWhere every breath is crystal, bold and bound.\n\nYet, in this chill, a warmth within is born,\nA sense of peace that only snow can bring,\nAs nature rests, and all is made forlorn.\n\nBut as the sun begins its gentle spring,\nThe snow shall melt, and rivers run anew,\nErasing traces of the winter's sting.\n\nThus, life continues in its ebb and dew,\nFrom death to birth, in cycles ever turn,\nThe snowfall's song, both end and start, adieu.\n\nNote: Terza rima is a verse form consisting of tercets (three-line stanzas) in which the end words of the lines rhymes in the pattern ABA, BCB, CDC, and so on. The lines are in iambic pentameter. This form was created by Dante Alighieri for his Divine Comedy.\n"
