        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a town, 4 out of every 7 residents own a car. The town has a population of 2100, and I need to find out how many residents own a car. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"4 out of every 7 residents own a car\" means. I think this is a ratio or a fraction. So, it's saying that for every 7 residents, 4 of them have a car. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the fraction of residents who own a car is 4/7. Now, the town has 2100 people. To find out how many own a car, I can multiply the total population by the fraction that owns cars.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of car owners = (4/7) * 2100\n\nOkay, now I just need to do the math. But let's see if there's a easier way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, since 4 out of 7 own a car, that means that the ratio of car owners to total residents is 4:7. So, if I set up a proportion, I can solve for the number of car owners.\n\nLet me denote the number of car owners as x. So, the proportion would be:\n\n4/7 = x/2100\n\nNow, to solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n4 * 2100 = 7 * x\n\nSo, 8400 = 7x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\nx = 8400 / 7\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n7 goes into 8400... 7 times 1200 is 8400. So, x = 1200.\n\nSo, 1200 residents own a car.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I have the total population is 2100, and 4 out of 7 own a car. So, 2100 divided by 7 is 300. Then, 4 times 300 is 1200. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If 4 out of 7 own a car, then the number of car owners is (4/7) of the total population.\n\nSo, (4/7) * 2100 = 4 * 300 = 1200.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
