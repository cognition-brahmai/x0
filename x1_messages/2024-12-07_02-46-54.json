        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the theme park has a budget of $15 million for a new roller coaster. The construction cost is broken down into three parts: the track, the trains, and theming and landscaping. The percentages are 50% for the track, 30% for the trains, and 20% for theming and landscaping. Additionally, there's an annual maintenance fee of 5% of the initial construction cost, and we need to estimate the total maintenance cost over 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the individual budgets for each component of the roller coaster.\n\n1. **Track:** 50% of $15 million\n\nTo find 50% of $15 million, I can multiply 15,000,000 by 0.50.\n\n\\( 15,000,000 \\times 0.50 = 7,500,000 \\)\n\nSo, the budget for the track is $7,500,000.\n\n2. **Trains:** 30% of $15 million\n\nSimilarly, for the trains, I'll multiply 15,000,000 by 0.30.\n\n\\( 15,000,000 \\times 0.30 = 4,500,000 \\)\n\nTherefore, the budget for the trains is $4,500,000.\n\n3. **Theming and Landscaping:** 20% of $15 million\n\nFor theming and landscaping, it's 20% of 15,000,000.\n\n\\( 15,000,000 \\times 0.20 = 3,000,000 \\)\n\nSo, the budget for theming and landscaping is $3,000,000.\n\nNow, let's verify that these amounts add up to the total budget.\n\n\\( 7,500,000 + 4,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 15,000,000 \\)\n\nYes, that matches the total budget of $15 million.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the annual maintenance fee and then find the total maintenance cost over 10 years.\n\nThe annual maintenance fee is 5% of the initial construction cost.\n\nSo, first, find 5% of $15 million.\n\n\\( 15,000,000 \\times 0.05 = 750,000 \\)\n\nTherefore, the annual maintenance fee is $750,000.\n\nTo find the total maintenance cost over 10 years, multiply the annual maintenance fee by 10.\n\n\\( 750,000 \\times 10 = 7,500,000 \\)\n\nSo, the total maintenance cost over 10 years is $7,500,000.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Track: $7,500,000\n\n- Trains: $4,500,000\n\n- Theming and Landscaping: $3,000,000\n\n- Total Maintenance over 10 years: $7,500,000\n\nI think that covers all the parts of the question. If there's anything else I need to consider, I'll double-check.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"additional annual maintenance fee of 5% of the initial construction cost.\" I've calculated it based on the total construction cost, which is $15 million. But just to be sure, maybe it's only on certain components, not the entire construction cost. Let's see.\n\nLooking back, it says \"annual maintenance fee of 5% of the initial construction cost.\" It seems to be referring to the total construction cost, not individual components. So, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps theming and landscaping don't require maintenance, but the problem doesn't specify that. It's probably safe to assume that the maintenance fee applies to the entire construction cost.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Track: } \\$7,500,000,\\ \\text{Trains: } \\$4,500,000,\\ \\text{Theming and Landscaping: } \\$3,000,000,\\ \\text{Total Maintenance over 10 years: } \\$7,500,000} \\]"
