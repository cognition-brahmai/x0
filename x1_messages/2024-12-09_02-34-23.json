        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 10, but there's a catch \u2014 two specific individuals can't be on the committee together. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of ways to choose a committee of 3 from 10 people without any restrictions. That should give me a baseline. Then, I can figure out how many committees would include both of those specific individuals and subtract that from the total. That should give me the number of valid committees where those two aren't together.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 people from 10 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of people, and k is the number to choose.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible committees without any restrictions.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these committees include both of the specific individuals who can't be together. Let's call these two individuals A and B.\n\nIf both A and B are on the committee, then the third member can be any of the remaining 8 people (since 10 - 2 = 8).\n\nSo, the number of committees that include both A and B is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid committees where A and B are not both present is the total number of committees minus the number of committees that include both A and B.\n\nThat is: 120 - 8 = 112.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal unrestricted committees: 120.\n\nCommittees with both A and B: 8.\n\nSo, subtracting those 8 from 120 gives 112 committees where A and B are not both present.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that in these 112 committees, A and B are not together. Does this cover all possibilities?\n\nLet me consider it differently. There are three scenarios:\n\n1. Committees that include A but not B.\n\n2. Committees that include B but not A.\n\n3. Committees that include neither A nor B.\n\nThese three scenarios should cover all committees where A and B are not both present.\n\nLet's calculate each one.\n\n1. Committees that include A but not B:\n\n- We choose A, and exclude B, so we have 8 other people to choose the remaining 2 spots.\n\n- Number of such committees: C(8, 2) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28.\n\n2. Committees that include B but not A:\n\n- Similarly, choose B, exclude A, and choose 2 more from the remaining 8.\n\n- Number of such committees: also C(8, 2) = 28.\n\n3. Committees that include neither A nor B:\n\n- Choose all 3 members from the remaining 8 people.\n\n- Number of such committees: C(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56.\n\nNow, add them up: 28 + 28 + 56 = 112.\n\nThis matches the previous result of 120 - 8 = 112.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of committees minus those that include both A and B.\n\nWhich again is 120 - 8 = 112.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 112.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that A and B could be in the committee but in different roles or something? The problem doesn't specify any roles, just that they can't be on the committee together.\n\nSo, the interpretation that both A and B cannot be members of the committee at the same time is correct.\n\nHence, subtracting the committees that include both from the total gives the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to calculate this is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal committees: C(10, 3) = 120.\n\nCommittees with A and B both: C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nSo, valid committees: 120 - 8 = 112.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach.\n\nSuppose I select the first member without any restrictions. There are 10 choices.\n\nThen, for the second member, I need to avoid selecting B if A was selected first, and vice versa.\n\nWait, this might get complicated because the selections are without regard to order, so it's better to stick with the combination approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of permutations, but since the committee is unordered, combinations are more appropriate.\n\nAnother way is to consider that if both A and B are in the committee, then the third member can be any of the remaining 8, which we've already calculated as 8 committees.\n\nTherefore, total valid committees are 120 - 8 = 112.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider a smaller example.\n\nSuppose I have 4 people, A, B, C, D, and I want to form committees of 2, with A and B not being together.\n\nTotal committees: C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nCommittees with both A and B: 1.\n\nTherefore, valid committees: 6 - 1 = 5.\n\nListing them: AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Yes, 5 committees without both A and B together.\n\nThis matches the approach.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, 120 - 8 = 112 should be correct.\n\nI can't think of any flaws in this logic, so I'm confident that 112 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]"
