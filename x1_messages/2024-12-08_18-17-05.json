        "content": "So, the factory produces 250 units per day and operates 5 days a week. We need to find out how many units it produces in a year, assuming there are no holidays or shutdowns.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many days the factory operates in a year. Since it operates 5 days a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total operating days as:\n\nOperating days per year = 5 days/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 days/year\n\nNow, if the factory produces 250 units per day, then in 260 days, it would produce:\n\nTotal units per year = 250 units/day * 260 days/year\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n250 multiplied by 260.\n\n250 * 260 = 250 * 200 + 250 * 60 = 50,000 + 15,000 = 65,000 units per year.\n\nSo, the factory produces 65,000 units in a year.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the weekly production and then multiply by the number of weeks in a year.\n\nWeekly production = 250 units/day * 5 days/week = 1,250 units/week\n\nThen, annual production = 1,250 units/week * 52 weeks/year\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n1,250 * 52.\n\n1,250 * 50 = 62,500\n\n1,250 * 2 = 2,500\n\nTotal = 62,500 + 2,500 = 65,000 units per year.\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any leap years or extra days.\n\nA standard year has 52 weeks and 1 day. Since the factory operates 5 days a week, that extra day might or might not be an operating day. But the problem says assuming no holidays or shutdowns, which might imply that every week follows the same operating schedule.\n\nHowever, to explore this further, in a non-leap year, there are 365 days, and 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So, there's one extra day beyond the 52 weeks.\n\nIf the factory operates 5 days a week, it's possible that this extra day is also an operating day, depending on which day of the week the extra day falls on.\n\nBut the problem seems to assume a straightforward 5 days a week over 52 weeks, totaling 260 days, without considering the extra day.\n\nGiven that, and to stick to the problem's assumptions, we can safely say the factory produces 65,000 units per year.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that there are 365 days in a year and the factory operates 5 days a week, which is approximately 260 days, but in reality, 365 days divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day, so over a year, it's possible that the factory operates slightly more than 260 days.\n\nBut again, given the problem's assumptions, we'll stick with 260 days.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 65,000 units per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65000} \\]"
