        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what's the probability of drawing 4 cards and having them all be face cards\u2014that is, kings, queens, or jacks? Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, and face cards are just the kings, queens, and jacks. So, how many face cards are there in total? Well, there are 4 kings, 4 queens, and 4 jacks in a deck, one for each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. So, total face cards would be 4 + 4 + 4, which is 12.\n\nSo, there are 12 face cards out of 52 total cards.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability of drawing 4 cards, all of which are face cards. I think this is about combinations, because the order in which we draw the cards doesn't matter here; we're just interested in the combination of cards we end up with.\n\nSo, the formula for probability is:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw 4 cards from 52, which is calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is C(52, 4).\n\nSimilarly, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 face cards from the 12 available face cards, which is C(12, 4).\n\nTherefore, the probability should be C(12, 4) / C(52, 4).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate C(12, 4):\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12 - 4)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / 24 = (11880) / 24 = 495\n\nWait, actually, 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 = 11,880, and 4! is 24, so 11,880 / 24 is indeed 495.\n\nNow, calculate C(52, 4):\n\nC(52, 4) = 52! / (4!(52 - 4)!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48!) / (24 \u00d7 48!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49) / 24\n\nCalculate numerator: 52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652; 2,652 \u00d7 50 = 132,600; 132,600 \u00d7 49 = 6,500,000 \u2013 wait, let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nActually, 2,652 \u00d7 50 is indeed 132,600. Then, 132,600 \u00d7 49.\n\n49 \u00d7 132,600:\n\nFirst, 50 \u00d7 132,600 = 6,630,000\n\nThen, subtract 1 \u00d7 132,600 = 6,630,000 - 132,600 = 6,497,400\n\nSo, C(52, 4) = 6,497,400 / 24\n\nNow, divide 6,497,400 by 24.\n\nFirst, 6,497,400 \u00f7 20 = 324,870\n\nThen, 6,497,400 \u00f7 4 = 1,624,350\n\nSo, 324,870 + 1,624,350 = 1,949,220\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should do it differently.\n\nAlternatively, divide 6,497,400 by 24:\n\n24 \u00d7 270,000 = 6,480,000\n\nSubtract: 6,497,400 - 6,480,000 = 17,400\n\n24 \u00d7 725 = 17,400\n\nSo, 270,000 + 725 = 270,725\n\nTherefore, C(52, 4) = 270,725\n\nWait, that can't be right because I recall that C(52, 4) is 270,725, but let me confirm.\n\nActually, yes, C(52, 4) is indeed 270,725.\n\nSo, now, the probability is C(12, 4) / C(52, 4) = 495 / 270,725\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nFirst, see if 495 and 270,725 have any common factors.\n\n495 divided by 5 is 99\n\n270,725 divided by 5 is 54,145\n\nSo, it becomes 99 / 54,145\n\nNow, check if 99 and 54,145 have any common factors.\n\n99 is 9 \u00d7 11, and 54,145 divided by 9 is not an integer, and divided by 11 is?\n\n54,145 \u00f7 11: 11 \u00d7 4,922 = 54,142, which is close but not exact. So, no common factors.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 99 / 54,145\n\nAlternatively, we can leave it as 495 / 270,725, but simplified, it's 99 / 54,145\n\nAlternatively, we can convert this to a decimal for better understanding.\n\nSo, 495 divided by 270,725 is approximately 0.001828\n\nTo express it as a percentage, multiply by 100: about 0.1828%\n\nSo, roughly 0.183% chance.\n\nAlternatively, we can express it in terms of odds, like 1 in a certain number.\n\nTo find that, divide 1 by the probability: 1 / 0.001828 \u2248 547.7\n\nSo, roughly 1 in 548.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing 4 face cards from a standard deck of 52 cards is about 1 in 548.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, C(12, 4) = 495, that seems correct.\n\nC(52, 4) = 270,725, that also seems correct.\n\nThen, 495 / 270,725 = 0.001828, which is about 0.183%, or roughly 1 in 548.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate it differently to verify.\n\nAnother way to calculate probability is to think about it step by step, considering the decreasing number of face cards as we draw them.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a face card on the first draw is 12/52.\n\nThen, given that the first card was a face card, the probability of drawing another face card is 11/51, and so on.\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n(12/52) \u00d7 (11/51) \u00d7 (10/50) \u00d7 (9/49)\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 12/52 = 3/13\n\nThen, 11/51\n\nThen, 10/50 = 1/5\n\nThen, 9/49\n\nSo, the probability is (3/13) \u00d7 (11/51) \u00d7 (1/5) \u00d7 (9/49)\n\nFirst, multiply 3/13 \u00d7 11/51 = (3 \u00d7 11) / (13 \u00d7 51) = 33 / 663 = 11 / 221\n\nThen, multiply by 1/5: 11 / 1,105\n\nFinally, multiply by 9/49: (11 \u00d7 9) / (1,105 \u00d7 49) = 99 / 54,145\n\nWait, that's the same as earlier: 99 / 54,145, which is approximately 0.001828, or 1 in 548.\n\nSo, both methods confirm the same result.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing 4 face cards from a standard deck is about 1 in 548.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{99}{54145}} \\]"
