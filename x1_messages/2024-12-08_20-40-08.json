        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 houses in the village, and each house has a dog. So, there are 50 dogs in total. Each dog has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs for all the dogs would be 50 dogs times 4 legs per dog, which is 200 legs.\n\nNow, the mayor decides to give away 10 dogs to another village. So, we need to subtract those 10 dogs from the total. That leaves us with 50 minus 10, which is 40 dogs remaining in the village.\n\nSince each of these remaining dogs still has 4 legs, the total number of legs for the remaining dogs would be 40 dogs times 4 legs per dog, which equals 160 legs.\n\nSo, the remaining dogs have 160 legs in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]\n"
