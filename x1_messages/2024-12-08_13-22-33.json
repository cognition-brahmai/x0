        "content": "According to the DSM-5, the disorder that best matches the symptoms described is C. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Let's break down the symptoms mentioned to understand why this is the case.\n\nFirst, the person has been exposed to a traumatic event and subsequently develops intense fear, helplessness, or horror. This is a key feature of PTSD, as the disorder is directly linked to the experience or witnessing of a traumatic event.\n\nSecond, the individual re-experiences the event through distressing recollections, dreams, and flashbacks. These are classic symptoms of PTSD, often referred to as intrusive symptoms. They indicate that the person is unable to move past the trauma and continues to relive it in various ways.\n\nThird, there is a tendency to avoid stimuli associated with the trauma. This avoidance can extend to thoughts, feelings, people, or situations that remind the person of the traumatic event. Avoidance is one of the core features of PTSD and is aimed at reducing distress but often leads to further problems.\n\nLastly, the person experiences symptoms of increased arousal, such as being easily startled, having difficulty sleeping, or feeling on edge. These hyperarousal symptoms are also characteristic of PTSD and represent a state of heightened vigilance in response to perceived threats.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options to see why they don't fit as well:\n\nA. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) involves chronic and excessive worry about a variety of topics, not necessarily linked to a specific traumatic event. While anxiety is present in PTSD, the focus is on the trauma and its aftermath, not on general worry.\n\nB. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and other depressive symptoms. While some overlap exists, such as feelings of helplessness, the re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms are not features of depression.\n\nD. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) involves recurrent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors (compulsions) aimed at reducing anxiety. While there may be some similarities in the intrusive nature of thoughts, the connection to a specific traumatic event is not a feature of OCD.\n\nTherefore, based on the symptoms described, PTSD is the most likely diagnosis according to the DSM-5 criteria.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
