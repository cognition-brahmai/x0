The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that the plane travels at an average speed of 550 miles per hour and needs to cover a distance of 2,750 miles, you can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{2,750 \\text{ miles}}{550 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\nNow, perform the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the flight will take 5 hours."
