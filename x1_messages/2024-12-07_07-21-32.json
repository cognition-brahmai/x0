        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Golang program that sets up a WebSocket connection, sends a message, and then prints any messages it receives back to the console. I'm not super familiar with WebSockets in Go, but I've done some networking stuff before, so I should be able to figure this out.\n\nFirst things first, I need to make sure I have the right package for WebSockets in Go. I remember that there's a package called \"gorilla/websocket\" that's pretty popular for handling WebSockets in Go. So, I should probably import that.\n\nOkay, so I'll need to import \"github.com/gorilla/websocket\". Before I start coding, maybe I should set up a simple server to test my WebSocket client. Maybe I can use Python's `websockets` library to quickly spin up a server for testing purposes.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to follow:\n\n1. Import the necessary packages: `net/url` for URL parsing, `log` for logging, and of course, `github.com/gorilla/websocket`.\n\n2. Parse the URL of the WebSocket server. WebSockets use the `ws://` or `wss://` scheme, so I need to make sure the URL is correctly formatted.\n\n3. Dial the WebSocket server using the `websocket.Dial` function, which will return a `*websocket.Conn` object that I can use to send and receive messages.\n\n4. Once connected, I can send a message using the `WriteMessage` method of the connection object.\n\n5. To receive messages, I can use a loop that calls the `ReadMessage` method in a loop, printing out any messages received.\n\n6. I should also handle any errors that might occur during dialing, sending, or receiving messages.\n\nLet me sketch out a rough structure of the code in my mind:\n\n- Parse the URL.\n\n- Dial the WebSocket server.\n\n- Send an initial message.\n\n- Start a loop to read messages from the server and print them.\n\n- Handle any errors appropriately.\n\nI should also consider making the program accept the server URL and the initial message as command-line arguments, so it's more flexible.\n\nOkay, let's think about error handling. WebSockets can fail to connect, or the server might close the connection unexpectedly. I need to make sure that the program doesn't crash if something goes wrong, but instead, logs the error and perhaps tries to reconnect or exits gracefully.\n\nMaybe for now, I'll keep it simple and just log any errors and exit. Reconnection logic can be added later if needed.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the type of messages I'm sending and receiving. WebSockets support different message types, like text and binary. For this example, let's assume we're dealing with text messages.\n\nIn Go, when using `websocket.Conn.WriteMessage`, I need to specify the message type, like `websocket.TextMessage`, and provide the message data as a []byte.\n\nSimilarly, when reading messages with `websocket.Conn.ReadMessage`, it returns the message type and the message data as []byte, along with any error that occurred.\n\nI should make sure that I'm handling the message types correctly, but since we're dealing with text messages, I can check that the type is `websocket.TextMessage` and then decode the []byte to a string.\n\nLet me think about the command-line arguments. I'll probably expect two arguments: the WebSocket URL and the initial message to send.\n\nI can use `os.Args` to get the command-line arguments. `os.Args[0]` is the program name, `os.Args[1]` would be the URL, and `os.Args[2]` would be the message.\n\nI should also add some checks to make sure that the user provides both arguments; otherwise, display an error message on how to use the program.\n\nPerhaps I can write a help message if the user doesn't provide the correct number of arguments.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Let me start writing some pseudocode to outline the steps.\n\nFirst, import the necessary packages:\n\n```go\n\nimport (\n\n    \"flag\"\n\n    \"github.com/gorilla/websocket\"\n\n    \"log\"\n\n    \"net/url\"\n\n)\n\n```\n\nWait, actually, instead of using `net/url` for parsing, I can use `websocket.Dial` which can handle the URL scheme correctly.\n\nLooking back at the gorilla/websocket documentation, `Dial` function signature is:\n\n```go\n\nfunc Dial(urlStr string, header http.Header) (*Conn, response.HeaderMap, error)\n\n```\n\nSo, it takes a URL string and an optional HTTP header.\n\nMaybe I don't need to parse the URL explicitly; I can just pass the URL string to `Dial`.\n\nLet me check the documentation for `Dial`. According to the gorilla/websocket documentation, `Dial` upgrades an HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection.\n\nI need to make sure that the URL scheme is correct; it should be `ws://` for unencrypted WebSockets and `wss://` for encrypted ones.\n\nI should also consider using `websocket.DefaultDialer` which is a `Dialer` struct that provides default values for dialing WebSockets.\n\nLooking at the documentation, `websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial` can be used instead of `websocket.Dial`, and it provides more flexibility.\n\nMaybe I should use `websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial` for better control.\n\nOkay, moving forward.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the main function.\n\nI can use `flag` package to parse command-line flags, but since I only have two required arguments, I can simply use `os.Args`.\n\nHere's a rough structure:\n\n- Check if exactly two arguments are provided; if not, print usage and exit.\n\n- Set up the WebSocket dialer.\n\n- Dial the WebSocket server.\n\n- Check if the connection was successful; if not, log the error and exit.\n\n- Send the initial message as a text message.\n\n- Start a loop to read messages from the server and print them.\n\n- Handle any errors in the loop; if an error occurs, log it and exit.\n\nLet me think about the loop for reading messages.\n\nI can use a for loop that runs indefinitely, reading messages from the connection and printing them until an error occurs.\n\nBut, to make it more efficient, I can run the reading in a separate goroutine, so that the main goroutine can handle sending messages if needed in the future.\n\nBut for now, since the requirement is just to send one initial message and then listen for responses, maybe a simple loop in the main function is sufficient.\n\nWait, but if I'm going to read messages in a loop, and also potentially send more messages in the future, it's better to have a separate goroutine for reading.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nI can start a separate goroutine for reading messages, and in the main goroutine, send the initial message and then wait for the program to be interrupted.\n\nBut, to keep it simple, I'll start with a single goroutine that sends the message and then reads in a loop.\n\nLater, if needed, I can make it more sophisticated.\n\nOkay, let's proceed.\n\nI need to remember to delay the closing of the connection until the program is supposed to exit.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case when the server closes the connection.\n\nIn that case, `ReadMessage` will return an error, and I should log that and exit.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan.\n\nLet me start writing some code.\n\nFirst, import the necessary packages:\n\n```go\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\n\t\"flag\"\n\n\t\"log\"\n\n\t\"net/url\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/websocket\"\n\n)\n\n```\n\nWait, as I thought earlier, maybe I don't need `net/url` if I'm just passing the URL string to `Dial`.\n\nLet me check.\n\nYes, `websocket.Dial` accepts a URL string, so I can skip parsing it myself unless I need to modify it.\n\nPerhaps, to be safe, I can ensure that the URL scheme is correct.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the user provides a correct URL.\n\nSo, I can omit the `net/url` import.\n\nUpdated imports:\n\n```go\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\n\t\"flag\"\n\n\t\"log\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/websocket\"\n\n)\n\n```\n\nNext, set up the command-line flags.\n\nI'll use `flag` package to parse the URL and the message.\n\nBut actually, since the order matters (URL first, then message), it's better to use `os.Args` directly.\n\nLet me see.\n\nUsing `flag` package:\n\n```go\n\nvar urlStr = flag.String(\"url\", \"\", \"WebSocket URL\")\n\nvar message = flag.String(\"message\", \"\", \"Initial message to send\")\n\n```\n\nThen, `flag.Parse()`\n\nBut this allows for named flags, which might be more flexible.\n\nAlternatively, using `os.Args`, I can expect the first argument to be the URL and the second to be the message.\n\nPerhaps using `flag` package is better for clarity.\n\nSo, I'll go with `flag` package.\n\nHere's how I'll set it up:\n\n```go\n\nvar urlStr = flag.String(\"url\", \"\", \"WebSocket URL\")\n\nvar message = flag.String(\"message\", \"\", \"Initial message to send\")\n\n```\n\nThen, in `main`:\n\n```go\n\nflag.Parse()\n\nif *urlStr == \"\" || *message == \"\" {\n\n\tlog.Fatal(\"Usage: program -url=WebSocketURL -message=InitialMessage\")\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, the user specifies the URL and message using flags.\n\nAlternatively, I can positionally take the arguments:\n\n```go\n\nif len(os.Args) != 3 {\n\n\tlog.Fatal(\"Usage: program URL MESSAGE\")\n\n}\n\nurlStr := os.Args[1]\n\nmessage := os.Args[2]\n\n```\n\nHmm, positionally might be simpler.\n\nSince this is a small program, I'll go with positional arguments using `os.Args`.\n\nNow, set up the WebSocket dialer.\n\nI can use `websocket.DefaultDialer`, which is configured with default values.\n\nBut, if I need to set some options, like the timeout, I can do that.\n\nFor now, I'll use `websocket.DefaultDialer`.\n\nHere's how to dial the server:\n\n```go\n\nconn, _, err := websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial(*urlStr, nil)\n\nif err != nil {\n\n\tlog.Fatal(\"Dial error:\", err)\n\n}\n\ndefer conn.Close()\n\n```\n\nThis dials the WebSocket server and returns a `*websocket.Conn` object, which I can use to send and receive messages.\n\nNext, send the initial message.\n\nSince it's a text message, I'll use `websocket.TextMessage`:\n\n```go\n\nerr := conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, []byte(*message))\n\nif err != nil {\n\n\tlog.Fatal(\"WriteMessage error:\", err)\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, set up a loop to read messages from the server and print them.\n\nI can use a for loop that reads messages in each iteration.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```go\n\nfor {\n\n\t_, message, err := conn.ReadMessage()\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\n\t\tlog.Println(\"ReadMessage error:\", err)\n\n\t\tbreak\n\n\t}\n\n\tlog.Printf(\"Received: %s\", message)\n\n}\n\n```\n\nHere, `ReadMessage` returns the message type, the message data, and any error.\n\nSince we're only dealing with text messages, I can ignore the message type.\n\nBut, to be safe, I can check if the message type is `websocket.TextMessage`.\n\nWait, actually, in this simple example, I'll assume that all messages are text messages.\n\nSo, I can just print the message as a string.\n\nBut, to be more precise, I should ensure that the message type is `websocket.TextMessage`.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```go\n\nfor {\n\n\tmsgType, message, err := conn.ReadMessage()\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\n\t\tlog.Println(\"ReadMessage error:\", err)\n\n\t\tbreak\n\n\t}\n\n\tif msgType == websocket.TextMessage {\n\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Received: %s\", message)\n\n\t} else {\n\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Received non-text message, ignoring.\")\n\n\t}\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, I only print text messages and ignore other types.\n\nNow, putting it all together, here's the rough structure of the code:\n\n```go\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\n\t\"flag\"\n\n\t\"log\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/websocket\"\n\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n\tflag.Parse()\n\n\tif len(flag.Args()) != 2 {\n\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Usage: program URL MESSAGE\")\n\n\t}\n\n\turlStr := flag.Arg(0)\n\n\tmessage := flag.Arg(1)\n\n\tconn, _, err := websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial(urlStr, nil)\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Dial error:\", err)\n\n\t}\n\n\tdefer conn.Close()\n\n\terr = conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, []byte(message))\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"WriteMessage error:\", err)\n\n\t}\n\n\tfor {\n\n\t\tmsgType, message, err := conn.ReadMessage()\n\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"ReadMessage error:\", err)\n\n\t\t\tbreak\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif msgType == websocket.TextMessage {\n\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Received: %s\", message)\n\n\t\t} else {\n\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Received non-text message, ignoring.\")\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t}\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWait a second, I used both `flag.Parse()` and `flag.Args()`. Maybe I should stick to one approach.\n\nActually, since I'm using `flag.Parse()` without defining any flags, `flag.Args()` will return all non-flag arguments.\n\nBut in this case, I expect exactly two positional arguments: URL and message.\n\nSo, I can use `os.Args` directly, but using `flag.Args()` is fine too.\n\nAlternatively, I can define two string flags: url and message.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nUsing flags:\n\n```go\n\nvar urlStr string\n\nvar message string\n\nflag.StringVar(&urlStr, \"url\", \"\", \"WebSocket URL\")\n\nflag.StringVar(&message, \"message\", \"\", \"Initial message to send\")\n\nflag.Parse()\n\nif urlStr == \"\" || message == \"\" {\n\n\tlog.Fatal(\"Usage: program -url=WebSocketURL -message=InitialMessage\")\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, the user specifies the URL and message using flags, which might be clearer.\n\nFor example, running the program as:\n\n`program -url=ws://example.com/socket -message=\"Hello, server!\"`\n\nAlternatively, positional arguments:\n\n`program ws://example.com/socket \"Hello, server!\"`\n\nBoth are acceptable, but using flags might be more explicit.\n\nI'll go with flags for clarity.\n\nUpdating the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding a way to specify the message type, but for simplicity, I'll assume it's always text.\n\nAlright, let's proceed.\n\nNow, to test this program, I need a WebSocket server to connect to.\n\nI can set up a simple WebSocket server using Python's `websockets` library.\n\nHere's a quick example of a WebSocket server in Python:\n\n```python\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport websockets\n\nasync def echo(websocket, path):\n\n\tasync for message in websocket:\n\n\t\tawait websocket.send(f\"Echo: {message}\")\n\nstart_server = websockets.serve(echo, \"localhost\", 8765)\n\nasyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)\n\nasyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()\n\n```\n\nSave this as `websocket_server.py` and run it with `python websocket_server.py`.\n\nThis sets up a WebSocket server at `ws://localhost:8765` that echoes back any message it receives.\n\nI can use this server to test my Go WebSocket client.\n\nSo, in my Go program, I can specify `ws://localhost:8765` as the URL and send a message like \"Hello, server!\".\n\nThe server should echo back \"Echo: Hello, server!\", and my Go program should print that to the console.\n\nPerfect.\n\nLet me write the Go code accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should handle any errors that occur during dialing or sending/receiving messages.\n\nI'll make sure to log any errors and exit appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, I can add a delay or a loop in the client to keep it running and receive multiple messages.\n\nBut for now, sending one message and receiving one response should suffice.\n\nWait, actually, in the earlier structure, I have a loop that keeps reading messages indefinitely.\n\nSo, it should handle multiple messages from the server.\n\nThat's good.\n\nI should test that.\n\nLet me think about potential issues.\n\n- The user provides an incorrect URL scheme (e.g., `http://` instead of `ws://`).\n\n- The server is not running or not reachable.\n\n- The message contains special characters that need to be properly encoded.\n\nI'll address these one by one.\n\nFirst, incorrect URL scheme: `websocket.Dial` should require the correct scheme (`ws://` or `wss://`). If an incorrect scheme is provided, it should return an error.\n\nSecond, server not running or not reachable: `Dial` will return a connection error in this case.\n\nThird, message with special characters: Since I'm sending the message as `[]byte`, Go should handle any characters correctly, as long as they're valid UTF-8 if it's a text message.\n\nI should make sure that the message is a valid string in Go.\n\nAlso, I should consider that very large messages might need to be handled differently, but for now, I'll assume messages are reasonably sized.\n\nAnother consideration is handling pings and pongs from the server.\n\nThe gorilla/websocket package handles pings and pongs automatically if I set the `EnablePingPong` option on the dialer.\n\nBut in the default dialer, this might already be enabled.\n\nI should check the documentation.\n\nLooking at the documentation, `websocket.DefaultDialer` has `EnablePingPong` set to true, so it should handle pings and pongs automatically.\n\nThat's good; I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the main points.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Golang program that establishes a WebSocket connection to a given server, sends a message, and prints any received messages back to the console, you can follow the steps below. This solution uses the `gorilla/websocket` package to handle WebSocket connections.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/websocket\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Define command-line flags\n\turlStr := flag.String(\"url\", \"\", \"WebSocket URL\")\n\tmessage := flag.String(\"message\", \"\", \"Initial message to send\")\n\tflag.Parse()\n\n\t// Check if both flags are provided\n\tif *urlStr == \"\" || *message == \"\" {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Usage: program -url=WebSocketURL -message=InitialMessage\")\n\t}\n\n\t// Set up the WebSocket connection\n\tconn, _, err := websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial(*urlStr, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Dial error:\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer conn.Close()\n\n\t// Send the initial message\n\terr = conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, []byte(*message))\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"WriteMessage error:\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Read messages from the server in a loop\n\tfor {\n\t\t_, msg, err := conn.ReadMessage()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"ReadMessage error:\", err)\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Received: %s\", msg)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import Necessary Packages**:\n   - `flag`: To handle command-line flags.\n   - `log`: For logging messages and errors.\n   - `github.com/gorilla/websocket`: For WebSocket connections.\n\n2. **Define Command-Line Flags**:\n   - `-url`: The WebSocket URL to connect to.\n   - `-message`: The initial message to send to the server.\n\n3. **Check Flags**:\n   - Ensure both flags are provided; otherwise, print usage and exit.\n\n4. **Establish WebSocket Connection**:\n   - Use `websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial` to connect to the provided URL.\n   - Handle any errors that occur during dialing.\n\n5. **Send Initial Message**:\n   - Use `conn.WriteMessage` to send a text message to the server.\n   - Handle any errors that occur during sending.\n\n6. **Receive Messages**:\n   - Use a loop to repeatedly read messages from the connection using `conn.ReadMessage`.\n   - Print any received messages to the console.\n   - Break the loop and handle errors if `ReadMessage` returns an error.\n\nThis program provides a simple way to interact with a WebSocket server, sending an initial message and listening for responses indefinitely until an error occurs or the connection is closed."
