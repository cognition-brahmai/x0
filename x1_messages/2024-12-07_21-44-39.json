        "content": "So you've got y equals the natural log of x, and you want to find dy/dx, which is the derivative of y with respect to x. The natural log, denoted as ln, is the logarithm to the base e, where e is approximately 2.71828. It's a fundamental function in calculus, and its derivative is a key result that you'll use a lot.\n\nTo find the derivative of y = ln(x), there are a few approaches. I'll walk you through a couple of them to give you a solid understanding.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Definition of the Derivative**\n\nThe derivative of a function y = f(x) is given by the limit:\n\ndy/dx = lim(h\u21920) [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h\n\nSo, for y = ln(x), this becomes:\n\ndy/dx = lim(h\u21920) [ln(x + h) - ln(x)] / h\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, specifically that ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we can rewrite this as:\n\ndy/dx = lim(h\u21920) ln((x + h)/x) / h = lim(h\u21920) ln(1 + h/x) / h\n\nThis limit might look a bit complicated, but we can simplify it by making a substitution. Let's let u = h/x, so as h approaches 0, u also approaches 0. Then h = u*x, and the limit becomes:\n\ndy/dx = lim(u\u21920) ln(1 + u) / (u*x)\n\nWe can separate the variables:\n\ndy/dx = (1/x) * lim(u\u21920) ln(1 + u) / u\n\nNow, it's a known limit that lim(u\u21920) ln(1 + u) / u = 1. This is a standard limit that you can either memorize or derive using L'H\u00f4pital's rule or the definition of e.\n\nTherefore:\n\ndy/dx = (1/x) * 1 = 1/x\n\nSo, the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x.\n\n**Method 2: Using Implicit Differentiation**\n\nAnother approach is to use implicit differentiation. If y = ln(x), then by the definition of logarithms, e^y = x.\n\nNow, differentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(e^y) = d/dx(x)\n\nThe right side is just 1. The left side requires the chain rule because e^y is a function of y, and y is a function of x.\n\nSo:\n\ne^y * dy/dx = 1\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = 1 / e^y\n\nBut recall that e^y = x, so:\n\ndy/dx = 1 / x\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same result: the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x.\n\n**Method 3: Using the Inverse Function Rule**\n\nSince the natural logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function, we can use the inverse function theorem. If y = f^{-1}(x), then dy/dx = 1 / f'(f^{-1}(x)).\n\nIn this case, y = ln(x) is the inverse of x = e^y. The derivative of e^y with respect to y is e^y.\n\nSo:\n\ndy/dx = 1 / e^{ln(x)} = 1 / x\n\nOnce again, we get dy/dx = 1/x.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo matter which method you use, you end up with the same result: the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x. This is a crucial result to remember in calculus, as it appears frequently in various applications, such as solving differential equations, optimization problems, and in the analysis of functions.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification on any of these methods, feel free to ask!"
