        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company's revenue. The revenue function is given by R(x) = 100x - x^2, where x is the number of items sold. I need to find the maximum revenue and figure out how many items must be sold to achieve that.\n\nOkay, first things first. This looks like a quadratic function, right? It's in the form of R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a = -1, b = 100, and c = 0. Quadratic functions graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, this parabola opens downwards. That means it has a maximum point, which is the vertex.\n\nSo, to find the maximum revenue, I need to find the vertex of this parabola. I remember that for a quadratic function in the form R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by x = -b/(2a). Then, I can plug that x-value back into the function to find the maximum revenue.\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nGiven R(x) = -x^2 + 100x,\n\na = -1,\n\nb = 100,\n\nc = 0.\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is x = -b/(2a).\n\nSo, x = -100 / (2 * -1) = -100 / -2 = 50.\n\nSo, the number of items that must be sold to achieve maximum revenue is 50.\n\nNow, to find the maximum revenue, I plug x = 50 back into the revenue function:\n\nR(50) = 100*(50) - (50)^2 = 5000 - 2500 = 2500.\n\nSo, the maximum revenue is 2500.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nI recall that another way to find the maximum or minimum of a function is to take its derivative and set it to zero. That gives the critical points. Since this is a quadratic function, and we've already determined it has a maximum, this should work.\n\nSo, let's take the derivative of R(x):\n\nR'(x) = d/dx (100x - x^2) = 100 - 2x.\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n100 - 2x = 0,\n\n2x = 100,\n\nx = 50.\n\nSo, again, x = 50 is the critical point. To confirm it's a maximum, I can take the second derivative:\n\nR''(x) = d/dx (100 - 2x) = -2.\n\nSince R''(x) = -2 < 0, the function is concave down at x = 50, which means it's a maximum.\n\nSo, this confirms that x = 50 is indeed the point where revenue is maximized.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's check the revenue at x = 50 and maybe at a couple of nearby points to see that it's indeed the maximum.\n\nR(50) = 100*50 - (50)^2 = 5000 - 2500 = 2500.\n\nLet's check R(49):\n\nR(49) = 100*49 - (49)^2 = 4900 - 2401 = 2499.\n\nAnd R(51):\n\nR(51) = 100*51 - (51)^2 = 5100 - 2601 = 2499.\n\nSo, indeed, R(50) is higher than its neighbors, confirming that it's a maximum.\n\nAlso, since this is a business context, we should consider if selling a non-integer number of items is possible. But in this case, x has to be a whole number because you can't sell a fraction of an item. So, x = 50 is the optimal number of items to sell for maximum revenue.\n\nI think that's it. The maximum revenue is 2500, achieved by selling 50 items.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2500 \\text{ at } x = 50} \\]"
