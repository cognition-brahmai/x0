        "content": "To create a Python script that connects to a MySQL database and retrieves records from the \"employees\" table, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install the MySQL connector for Python**: If you haven't already installed the `mysql-connector-python` package, you can do so using pip.\n\n2. **Set up the database connection**: Use the credentials to connect to your MySQL database.\n\n3. **Execute a SQL query to retrieve all records from the \"employees\" table**.\n\n4. **Calculate the average salary** of all employees.\n\n5. **Display the employee details along with the average salary**.\n\nBelow is a sample script that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\nfrom mysql.connector import Error\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Connect to the MySQL database\n        connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n            host='your_host',\n            database='your_database',\n            user='your_username',\n            password='your_password'\n        )\n        \n        if connection.is_connected():\n            db_Info = connection.get_server_info()\n            print(\"Connected to MySQL Server version \", db_Info)\n            cursor = connection.cursor()\n            cursor.execute(\"select database();\")\n            record = cursor.fetchone()\n            print(\"You're connected to database: \", record)\n            \n            # Step 2: Retrieve all records from the employees table\n            cursor.execute(\"SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email, salary FROM employees\")\n            records = cursor.fetchall()\n            \n            if records:\n                # Step 3: Calculate the average salary\n                total_salary = 0\n                num_employees = len(records)\n                for row in records:\n                    total_salary += row[4]  # salary is in the 5th column\n                average_salary = total_salary / num_employees\n                \n                # Step 4: Display employee details\n                print(\"\\nEmployee Details:\")\n                for row in records:\n                    print(f\"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]} {row[2]}, Email: {row[3]}, Salary: {row[4]}\")\n                \n                # Step 5: Display the average salary\n                print(f\"\\nAverage Salary: {average_salary}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"No records found in the employees table.\")\n    \n    except Error as e:\n        print(\"Error while connecting to MySQL\", e)\n    finally:\n        if connection.is_connected():\n            cursor.close()\n            connection.close()\n            print(\"MySQL connection is closed\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Connecting to the Database**:\n   - Use `mysql.connector.connect` with appropriate credentials.\n   \n2. **Retrieving Records**:\n   - Execute a SELECT query to fetch all rows from the \"employees\" table.\n   \n3. **Calculating Average Salary**:\n   - Iterate through the fetched records to sum up the salaries and then calculate the average.\n   \n4. **Displaying Results**:\n   - Print each employee's details.\n   - Print the calculated average salary.\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_host'`, `'your_database'`, `'your_username'`, and `'your_password'` with your actual database connection details.\n\nThis script assumes that the \"employees\" table exists and has the specified columns. If there are any discrepancies in column names or table structure, adjust the query accordingly."
