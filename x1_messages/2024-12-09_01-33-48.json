Each step in the plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, prior evidence values, or a mix of both.\n\nAvailable tools for usage:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool enabling users to perform searches using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It helps in locating a range of sites that might hold the answer to the user's inquiry.\nSiteScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline separated links, where input consists of one or more links, and yields plain text output comprising the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Pulls out links from plain text and generates a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nAIQA[input]: An artificial intelligence-based question-answering model, especially effective in responding to queries based on an input text passage. The input has to be a textual question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the height of the Eiffel Tower, given :evidence1:?\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [initial action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to invoke with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action based on outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to invoke and input parameter, potentially including reference to earlier evidence, e.g., \"Considering context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate answer]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the telephone and what were some major developments in its early history?"
