        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here. The library has 12,000 books in total, and 25% of those are fiction. I need to find out how many non-fiction books there are. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The total number of books is 12,000, and 25% of them are fiction. That means the rest are non-fiction. So, if I can find out how many books are fiction, I can subtract that number from the total to get the number of non-fiction books.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal books = 12,000\n\nFiction books = 25% of total books\n\nNon-fiction books = Total books - Fiction books\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, I need to calculate 25% of 12,000 to find the number of fiction books.\n\nI know that \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 25% is the same as 25 per 100, or 25/100, which simplifies to 0.25. So, to find 25% of 12,000, I can multiply 12,000 by 0.25.\n\nLet's do that calculation:\n\nFiction books = 12,000 * 0.25\n\nI can calculate this as:\n\n12,000 * 0.25 = 3,000\n\nSo, there are 3,000 fiction books in the library.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-fiction books, I subtract the number of fiction books from the total number of books:\n\nNon-fiction books = 12,000 - 3,000 = 9,000\n\nTherefore, there are 9,000 non-fiction books in the library.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe instead of finding the fiction books first and then subtracting, I could directly find the percentage of non-fiction books and calculate that.\n\nLet's see: if 25% are fiction, then the remaining percentage must be non-fiction. Since 100% is the total, non-fiction would be 100% - 25% = 75%.\n\nSo, non-fiction books = 75% of total books\n\nAgain, percent means per hundred, so 75% is 75/100, which is 0.75.\n\nTherefore, non-fiction books = 12,000 * 0.75\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n12,000 * 0.75 = 9,000\n\nSo, again, I get 9,000 non-fiction books.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It means I probably did it correctly.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check my calculations again.\n\nFirst method:\n\nFiction books = 12,000 * 0.25 = 3,000\n\nNon-fiction books = 12,000 - 3,000 = 9,000\n\nSecond method:\n\nNon-fiction books = 12,000 * 0.75 = 9,000\n\nBoth methods confirm the same number. I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of fractions. Since 25% is the same as 1/4, fiction books would be 1/4 of the total books.\n\nSo, fiction books = (1/4) * 12,000 = 3,000\n\nNon-fiction books = 12,000 - 3,000 = 9,000\n\nOr, since non-fiction is 75%, which is 3/4:\n\nNon-fiction books = (3/4) * 12,000 = 9,000\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think no matter which way I look at it, the answer remains consistent. So, the library has 9,000 non-fiction books.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any careless mistakes, let's verify the calculations once more.\n\n12,000 multiplied by 0.25 is indeed 3,000.\n\n12,000 minus 3,000 is indeed 9,000.\n\n12,000 multiplied by 0.75 is also 9,000.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI can also consider if there's any other information I might have missed in the problem. It says the library contains 12,000 books, 25% are fiction, and I need to find the number of non-fiction books. There doesn't seem to be any other data or conditions to consider.\n\nSo, I believe 9,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9000} \\]"
