        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: a spider has 8 legs. If I count 64 legs, how many spiders are there? Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that each spider has 8 legs. So, if I have one spider, that's 8 legs. Two spiders would have 16 legs, because 2 times 8 is 16. Three spiders would have 24 legs, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many spiders would have a total of 64 legs. So, I think I need to divide the total number of legs by the number of legs per spider. That makes sense.\n\nSo, 64 legs divided by 8 legs per spider. Let me do the division: 64 divided by 8.\n\nI know that 8 times 8 is 64. So, 8 multiplied by 8 equals 64. Therefore, 64 divided by 8 should be 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I have 8 spiders, each with 8 legs, then 8 times 8 is indeed 64 legs. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of addition. If each spider has 8 legs, then adding one spider adds 8 legs each time. So, starting from 0, adding one spider gives 8, two spiders give 16, three give 24, four give 32, five give 40, six give 48, seven give 56, and eight give 64. So, again, 8 spiders give me 64 legs.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use subtraction. If I have 64 legs and I keep removing spiders one by one, each time removing 8 legs, how many times can I do that before I reach zero?\n\nSo, start with 64 legs. Remove one spider's 8 legs: 64 minus 8 is 56. That's one spider. Then, 56 minus 8 is 48: that's two spiders. Continue this process:\n\n56 - 8 = 48 (2 spiders)\n\n48 - 8 = 40 (3 spiders)\n\n40 - 8 = 32 (4 spiders)\n\n32 - 8 = 24 (5 spiders)\n\n24 - 8 = 16 (6 spiders)\n\n16 - 8 = 8 (7 spiders)\n\n8 - 8 = 0 (8 spiders)\n\nSo, again, I end up with 8 spiders.\n\nI think I've confirmed it through multiplication, addition, and subtraction. All these methods lead me to the same answer: there are 8 spiders if there are 64 legs.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use fractions or decimals, but that doesn't seem necessary here since 64 divided by 8 is a whole number. But let's consider if there were leftover legs or something.\n\nSuppose I had 65 legs. Then, 65 divided by 8 would be 8 spiders with 1 leg left over, or 8.125 spiders, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a spider in this context. But since we have exactly 64 legs, which is a multiple of 8, it works out perfectly.\n\nAlso, I should consider units. Legs are the units here, and spiders are the things having legs. So, legs per spider is a rate, and I'm using that rate to find the number of spiders.\n\nIn algebraic terms, if s is the number of spiders, and each spider has 8 legs, then total legs l = 8s. We have l = 64, so 8s = 64. Solving for s, s = 64 / 8 = 8.\n\nSo, using algebra, I get the same answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is definitely 8 spiders.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
