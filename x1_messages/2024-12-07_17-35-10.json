        "content": "I'd be happy to help you solve this differential equation using Laplace transforms. The equation is:\n\ndy/dt + 2y = e^(-t), with initial condition y(0) = 1.\n\nAlright, so the first step in solving this using Laplace transforms is to take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation. Remember, the Laplace transform of a function y(t) is denoted by Y(s), where s is a complex variable.\n\nSo, let's recall some properties of Laplace transforms that will be useful here:\n\n1. The Laplace transform of the derivative dy/dt is sY(s) - y(0).\n\n2. The Laplace transform of e^(-at) is 1/(s + a).\n\n3. The Laplace transform of a constant multiple is that constant times the transform of the function.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed step by step.\n\nStep 1: Take the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation.\n\nStarting with:\n\ndy/dt + 2y = e^(-t)\n\nTaking Laplace transforms:\n\nL{dy/dt} + 2 L{y} = L{e^(-t)}\n\nUsing the properties mentioned:\n\nsY(s) - y(0) + 2 Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nNow, plug in the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\nsY(s) - 1 + 2 Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nStep 2: Solve for Y(s).\n\nLet's combine like terms:\n\n(s + 2) Y(s) - 1 = 1/(s + 1)\n\nNow, add 1 to both sides:\n\n(s + 2) Y(s) = 1 + 1/(s + 1)\n\nTo combine the terms on the right, find a common denominator, which is (s + 1):\n\n(s + 2) Y(s) = (s + 1)/(s + 1) + 1/(s + 1) = (s + 2)/(s + 1)\n\nNow, divide both sides by (s + 2):\n\nY(s) = (s + 2)/[(s + 1)(s + 2)] = 1/(s + 1)\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check that.\n\nActually, I see that in the numerator, we have (s + 2), and in the denominator, we have (s + 1)(s + 2), so yes, they cancel out, leaving Y(s) = 1/(s + 1).\n\nStep 3: Take the inverse Laplace transform to find y(t).\n\nSince Y(s) = 1/(s + 1), and we know that the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s + a) is e^(-at), then:\n\ny(t) = e^(-t)\n\nWait, but let's check if this satisfies the original differential equation and the initial condition.\n\nPlugging y(t) = e^(-t) into the differential equation:\n\ndy/dt + 2y = -e^(-t) + 2e^(-t) = e^(-t)\n\nWhich matches the right-hand side of the differential equation.\n\nNow, check the initial condition:\n\ny(0) = e^(0) = 1\n\nWhich matches the given initial condition.\n\nSo, the solution is y(t) = e^(-t).\n\nBut, let me think again. This seems almost too simple. Usually, when solving differential equations with Laplace transforms, we might encounter more complex expressions that require partial fraction decomposition or other techniques.\n\nLet me re-examine the steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIn step 1, taking the Laplace transform:\n\nL{dy/dt} + 2 L{y} = L{e^(-t)}\n\nWhich gives:\n\nsY(s) - y(0) + 2 Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nPlugging y(0) = 1:\n\nsY(s) - 1 + 2 Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nCombining terms:\n\n(s + 2) Y(s) = 1 + 1/(s + 1)\n\nExpressing the right-hand side with a common denominator:\n\n(s + 2) Y(s) = (s + 1 + 1)/(s + 1) = (s + 2)/(s + 1)\n\nThen, Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nFinally, y(t) = e^(-t)\n\nEverything seems correct, and the solution satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.\n\nTherefore, the solution is y(t) = e^(-t).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{y(t) = e^{-t}} \\]"
