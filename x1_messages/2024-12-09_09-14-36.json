        "content": "To solve this problem, we'll design a C# program that reads data from a CSV file containing employee information and calculates the total salary paid per department. We'll use a dictionary to store and aggregate the salaries by department.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading the CSV File:**\n   - We'll use the `System.IO` namespace to read the CSV file.\n   - Assume the CSV has columns: ID, name, department, salary.\n\n2. **Storing and Aggregating Data:**\n   - Use a dictionary where the key is the department name and the value is the total salary for that department.\n\n3. **Printing the Results:**\n   - Iterate through the dictionary and print each department along with its total salary.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string csvPath = \"employees.csv\"; // Path to the CSV file\n        var departmentSalaries = new Dictionary<string, decimal>();\n\n        try\n        {\n            using (var reader = new StreamReader(csvPath))\n            {\n                string line;\n                bool firstLine = true;\n\n                while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)\n                {\n                    if (firstLine)\n                    {\n                        firstLine = false;\n                        continue; // Skip the header line\n                    }\n\n                    var columns = line.Split(',');\n                    if (columns.Length != 4)\n                    {\n                        Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid data format in CSV.\");\n                        continue;\n                    }\n\n                    string department = columns[2].Trim();\n                    if (decimal.TryParse(columns[3], out decimal salary))\n                    {\n                        if (departmentSalaries.ContainsKey(department))\n                        {\n                            departmentSalaries[department] += salary;\n                        }\n                        else\n                        {\n                            departmentSalaries[department] = salary;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid salary format.\");\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Print the total salaries per department\n            foreach (var department in departmentSalaries.Keys)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine($\"Department: {department}, Total Salary: {departmentSalaries[department]}\");\n            }\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"An error occurred: {ex.Message}\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the CSV File:**\n   - We use a `StreamReader` to read the file line by line.\n   - The first line is skipped assuming it contains headers.\n\n2. **Processing Each Line:**\n   - Each line is split by commas to separate the columns.\n   - The department name and salary are extracted.\n   - Salaries are parsed to decimal and aggregated in a dictionary.\n\n3. **Handling Errors:**\n   - If a line has an incorrect number of columns, it skips that line.\n   - If the salary is not a valid decimal, it prints an error message.\n\n4. **Printing Results:**\n   - After processing all lines, it iterates through the dictionary and prints the total salary for each department.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program is robust, handles errors gracefully, and provides clear output."
