        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 100 people in a group, and among them, 80 have dogs, 60 have cats, and 40 have both dogs and cats. I need to find out how many people have neither a dog nor a cat.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. We have a total of 100 people, and some of them have dogs, some have cats, and some have both. I need to find out how many have neither.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many people have either a dog or a cat or both. Then, I can subtract that number from the total to find out how many have neither.\n\nI recall there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here. It helps to avoid double-counting when dealing with overlapping sets.\n\nSo, according to the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of people who have either a dog or a cat is equal to the number who have dogs plus the number who have cats minus the number who have both.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- D as the set of people who have dogs.\n\n- C as the set of people who have cats.\n\nThen, the number of people who have either a dog or a cat is |D \u222a C| = |D| + |C| - |D \u2229 C|.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- |D| = 80\n\n- |C| = 60\n\n- |D \u2229 C| = 40\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\n|D \u222a C| = 80 + 60 - 40 = 100.\n\nSo, 100 people have either a dog or a cat or both.\n\nNow, since there are 100 people in total, and 100 have either a dog or a cat or both, that would suggest that 0 people have neither.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Is there a mistake here?\n\nLet me double-check the numbers.\n\nTotal people = 100\n\nHave dogs: 80\n\nHave cats: 60\n\nHave both: 40\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nOnly dogs: 80 - 40 = 40\n\nOnly cats: 60 - 40 = 20\n\nBoth: 40\n\nTotal with pets: 40 (only dogs) + 20 (only cats) + 40 (both) = 100\n\nSo, indeed, all 100 people have at least one pet, either a dog, a cat, or both.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who have neither a dog nor a cat is 0.\n\nBut, to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nLet me consider drawing a Venn diagram in my mind.\n\nOne circle represents dog owners, the other represents cat owners.\n\nThe overlap between the two circles represents people who have both dogs and cats.\n\nGiven that 40 have both, then:\n\nOnly dog owners: 80 - 40 = 40\n\nOnly cat owners: 60 - 40 = 20\n\nSo, total pet owners: 40 (only dogs) + 20 (only cats) + 40 (both) = 100\n\nAgain, this confirms that all 100 people have at least one pet.\n\nTherefore, the number of people with neither a dog nor a cat is 0.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps the numbers don't add up correctly, or maybe there's an assumption I'm making that isn't valid.\n\nLet me check the inclusion-exclusion principle again.\n\nYes, for two sets, it's |D \u222a C| = |D| + |C| - |D \u2229 C|.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|D \u222a C| = 80 + 60 - 40 = 100.\n\nTotal people are 100, so 100 - 100 = 0 have neither.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the given numbers.\n\nLet me see: 80 have dogs, 60 have cats, 40 have both.\n\nIs it possible for 40 to have both when there are only 60 with cats and 80 with dogs?\n\nYes, because 40 is less than both 60 and 80.\n\nSo, the numbers seem consistent.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion remains that 0 people have neither a dog nor a cat.\n\nMaybe to be absolutely sure, I can consider the possibility of people having other pets.\n\nBut the question is specifically about dogs and cats.\n\nIt doesn't mention any other pets, so I should assume that only dogs and cats are being considered.\n\nTherefore, everyone has at least one of the two: a dog or a cat or both.\n\nHence, the answer is 0.\n\nI think that's definitive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
