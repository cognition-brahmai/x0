        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A store sells widgets with a profit margin of 30%, and they buy each widget from their supplier for $20. I need to find out what the selling price is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a profit margin is. I think profit margin is the percentage of the selling price that is profit. So, if the profit margin is 30%, that means that 30% of the selling price is profit.\n\nLet me denote the selling price as SP. The cost price is given as $20. Profit would be SP minus the cost price, which is SP - 20.\n\nAccording to the profit margin, profit is 30% of the selling price. So, I can write the equation:\n\nProfit = 0.30 * SP\n\nBut I also know that Profit = SP - 20\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\nSP - 20 = 0.30 * SP\n\nNow, I can solve for SP.\n\nSubtract 0.30 * SP from both sides:\n\nSP - 0.30 * SP = 20\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n0.70 * SP = 20\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.70:\n\nSP = 20 / 0.70\n\nSP = approximately $28.57\n\nWait a minute, let me check that calculation again.\n\n20 divided by 0.70:\n\n20 / 0.70 = 20 / (7/10) = 20 * (10/7) = 200/7 \u2248 28.57\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the selling price should be approximately $28.57.\n\nBut let me double-check if I understood profit margin correctly. Sometimes, profit margin can be defined based on the cost price rather than the selling price. I think I need to clarify that.\n\nI recall that there are different types of profit margins: profit margin based on selling price and profit margin based on cost price.\n\nIf it's based on selling price, then profit is 30% of SP, as I did earlier.\n\nIf it's based on cost price, then profit is 30% of the cost price.\n\nWait, the problem says \"profit margin of 30%.\" I need to make sure which one it is.\n\nI think in business, profit margin based on selling price is more common. But to be sure, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, profit margin based on selling price:\n\nProfit = SP - Cost Price\n\nProfit Margin = Profit / SP = 0.30\n\nSo, Profit = 0.30 * SP\n\nAlso, Profit = SP - 20\n\nTherefore, 0.30 * SP = SP - 20\n\nSolving for SP:\n\n0.30 * SP - SP = -20\n\n-0.70 * SP = -20\n\nSP = 20 / 0.70 = approximately $28.57\n\nNow, profit margin based on cost price:\n\nProfit = SP - Cost Price\n\nProfit Margin = Profit / Cost Price = 0.30\n\nSo, Profit = 0.30 * Cost Price = 0.30 * 20 = $6\n\nTherefore, SP = Cost Price + Profit = 20 + 6 = $26\n\nHmm, that gives a different selling price.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI think the first method is what's intended, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nUpon checking, I find that there are two main types of profit margins:\n\n1. Profit margin based on selling price (also called gross profit margin): Profit / Selling Price\n\n2. Profit margin based on cost price (also called markup): Profit / Cost Price\n\nIn business, profit margin usually refers to profit as a percentage of selling price, while markup is profit as a percentage of cost price.\n\nGiven that, in the first method, profit is 30% of SP, leading to SP = $28.57\n\nIn the second method, profit is 30% of CP, leading to SP = $26\n\nBut I think the problem is referring to a 30% profit margin on the selling price, so the first method is appropriate.\n\nHowever, in practice, when people talk about profit margin, they often mean profit as a percentage of selling price.\n\nSo, sticking with the first method, the selling price should be approximately $28.57\n\nBut let me confirm this with another approach.\n\nIf the store wants a 30% profit margin based on selling price, that means that 30% of the selling price is profit, and 70% is the cost price.\n\nSo, Cost Price = 70% of SP\n\nTherefore, 0.70 * SP = 20\n\nSo, SP = 20 / 0.70 = approximately $28.57\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a 30% markup on cost price, then SP = CP + 30% of CP = 20 + 0.30*20 = 20 + 6 = $26\n\nBut since the problem says \"profit margin\" rather than \"markup,\" I think $28.57 is the correct selling price.\n\nTo be absolutely sure, I might want to ask the store what they mean by profit margin, but assuming it's based on selling price, $28.57 is the right answer.\n\nSo, the store should sell each widget for approximately $28.57\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28.57} \\]"
