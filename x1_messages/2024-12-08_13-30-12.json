        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see, there's a box with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, so total balls in the box are 5 plus 7, which is 12 balls. Now, the question is, if you pick two balls at random without replacement, what's the probability that both are red.\n\nOkay, probability questions can sometimes trip me up, but let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what it means to pick two balls without replacement. That means once I pick the first ball, it's not going back into the box, so the total number of balls decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nSo, for the first pick, the probability of picking a red ball should be the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5 red out of 12 total, so 5/12.\n\nNow, if the first ball is red, there are now 4 red balls left and the total number of balls is now 11, since we didn't replace the first ball. So, the probability of picking another red ball is 4/11.\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen\u2014both picks are red\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening in sequence. So, it should be (5/12) multiplied by (4/11).\n\nLet me calculate that. 5 times 4 is 20, and 12 times 11 is 132, so 20/132. I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives 5/33.\n\nWait, let me check that simplification again. 20 divided by 4 is 5, and 132 divided by 4 is 33, so yes, 5/33.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is \u201c12 choose 2,\u201d which is calculated as 12! divided by (2! times (12-2)!), which simplifies to (12 times 11)/2 = 66.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 5 is \u201c5 choose 2,\u201d which is (5 times 4)/2 = 10.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are red is the number of ways to pick 2 red balls divided by the total number of ways to pick any 2 balls, which is 10/66, which simplifies to 5/33.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier result. Good, it's consistent.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe using percentages or something.\n\nLet's see, the probability of picking the first red ball is 5/12, which is approximately 0.4167, or 41.67%.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of picking another red ball is 4/11, which is approximately 0.3636, or 36.36%.\n\nMultiplying those gives approximately 0.4167 times 0.3636, which is about 0.1515, or 15.15%, which is roughly 5/33, since 5 divided by 33 is approximately 0.1515.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability that the first ball is red and the second ball is red. Since the picks are without replacement, the events are dependent.\n\nSo, P(both red) = P(first red) times P(second red given first red), which is exactly what I calculated earlier.\n\nIs there any other approach I can use to verify this?\n\nMaybe using permutations. Although combinations are more straightforward for this problem, perhaps permutations can also be applied.\n\nIf I consider the order matters, then the total number of ways to pick two balls in order is 12 options for the first pick and 11 for the second, so 12 times 11 equals 132.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two red balls in order is 5 options for the first pick and 4 for the second, so 5 times 4 equals 20.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 20/132, which simplifies to 5/33.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I\u2019ve confirmed it sufficiently. The probability that both balls are red is 5/33.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any possibility that the order affects the probability? In this case, since we're dealing with without replacement and the question is about both balls being red, not about the order, combinations are the right way to go.\n\nAlso, ensuring that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's see:\n\n- Total balls: 5 red + 7 blue = 12\n\n- P(first red) = 5/12\n\n- P(second red | first red) = 4/11\n\n- Therefore, P(both red) = (5/12) * (4/11) = 20/132 = 5/33\n\nSeems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the probability step by step using fractions.\n\nFirst pick: 5 red out of 12 total, so 5/12.\n\nSecond pick, given the first was red: 4 red out of 11 total, so 4/11.\n\nMultiply them: (5/12) * (4/11) = (5 * 4)/(12 * 11) = 20/132.\n\nSimplify 20/132 by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 20 \u00f7 4 = 5, 132 \u00f7 4 = 33, so 5/33.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using combinations:\n\n- Total ways to pick 2 balls from 12: C(12,2) = (12*11)/2 = 66\n\n- Ways to pick 2 red balls from 5: C(5,2) = (5*4)/2 = 10\n\n- Therefore, P(both red) = 10/66 = 5/33\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've covered it from multiple angles and the answer holds up.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
