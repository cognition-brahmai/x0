The bookshelf is half full, and I need to find out how many books are on the shelf.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"half full\" means. If the bookshelf is half full, that means it's filled to 50% of its maximum capacity.\n\nSo, what's the maximum capacity of the bookshelf? Well, there are 5 rows, and each row can hold 30 books. So, the total maximum number of books the shelf can hold is 5 rows times 30 books per row.\n\nLet me calculate that: 5 times 30 is 150. So, the bookshelf can hold a maximum of 150 books.\n\nNow, since it's half full, I need to find half of 150.\n\nHalf of 150 is 75.\n\nSo, there are 75 books on the shelf.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there a chance that not every row is filled to the same degree? The problem says each row can hold up to 30 books, and the bookshelf is half full. It doesn't specify if each row is equally half full or if some rows are more full than others.\n\nBut since it's overall half full, I think it's safe to assume that on average, each row is half full.\n\nSo, another way to look at it is: each row can hold 30 books, half of that is 15 books per row.\n\nThen, with 5 rows, each half full with 15 books, the total number of books is 5 times 15, which is also 75.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier, so that's reassuring.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe consider the total possible spots for books and then take half of that.\n\nYes, the total possible spots are 5 rows times 30 books per row, which is 150 spots.\n\nSince it's half full, half of 150 spots are occupied, which is 75 books.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\nSo, the number of books on the shelf is 75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
