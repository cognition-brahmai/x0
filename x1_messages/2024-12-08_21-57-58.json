        "content": "Given the user's request to \"Filter out images larger than 5MB from my dataset,\" I need to select the most appropriate function from the available options and determine the necessary parameters.\n\nFirst, let's understand the user's\u9700\u6c42. They have a dataset containing images, and they want to remove any images that are larger than 5 megabytes in size. This seems like a task related to image processing, specifically filtering based on file size.\n\nLooking at the available functions:\n\n1. **image_processing**:\n\n- Description: Performs various operations on images such as resizing, filtering, etc.\n\n- Parameters:\n\n- action: The operation to perform on the image (\"resize\", \"filter_by_size\", etc.)\n\n- size_limit: The maximum size limit for the image (in MB).\n\n2. **data_sorting**:\n\n- Description: Sorts data based on specified criteria.\n\n- Parameters:\n\n- sort_column: The column to sort by.\n\n- order: The order to sort in (\"asc\" for ascending, \"desc\" for descending).\n\n3. **text_analysis**:\n\n- Description: Analyzes text for sentiment, key phrases, etc.\n\n- Parameters:\n\n- text: The text to analyze.\n\n- analysis_type: The type of analysis to perform (\"sentiment\", \"key_phrases\", etc.).\n\nGiven that the task involves images and filtering based on size, the **image_processing** function seems the most appropriate. Specifically, the \"filter_by_size\" action aligns with the user's requirement.\n\nThe **data_sorting** function is for sorting data, which doesn't directly address the filtering based on size. The **text_analysis** function is unrelated to image processing or data filtering.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the **image_processing** function with the \"filter_by_size\" action and set the size_limit to 5MB.\n\nTo confirm, I need to ensure that the function can handle the dataset and filter out images exceeding the specified size.\n\nAssuming that the function is capable of processing a dataset of images and filtering based on size, this should meet the user's\u9700\u6c42.\n\nIn summary, the selected function is **image_processing** with the parameters:\n\n- action: \"filter_by_size\"\n\n- size_limit: 5\n\n## Final Solution\nTo address the user's request to filter out images larger than 5MB from their dataset, the most suitable function is `image_processing` with the `filter_by_size` action and a `size_limit` of 5MB.\n\n```yaml\nfunction: image_processing\nparams:\n  action: filter_by_size\n  size_limit: 5\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe user wants to remove images larger than 5MB from their dataset. The `image_processing` function is designed to perform various operations on images, including filtering based on size. By specifying the `action` as `filter_by_size` and setting the `size_limit` to 5MB, the function will filter out any images exceeding this size limit. This approach is directly aligned with the user's requirement and efficiently accomplishes the task without needing to sort or analyze text data."
