        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 students in the class, and each student has either a cat or a dog as a pet. So, the total number of pets is 50, I think. Now, it says there are 20 more dogs than cats. Hmm, I need to find out how many cats there are.\n\nLet me try to set this up with some variables. Let's say the number of cats is C and the number of dogs is D. Since each student has one pet, C + D = 50.\n\nAnd because there are 20 more dogs than cats, D = C + 20.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. C + D = 50\n\n2. D = C + 20\n\nMaybe I can substitute the second equation into the first one. So, C + (C + 20) = 50.\n\nThat simplifies to 2C + 20 = 50.\n\nNow, subtract 20 from both sides: 2C = 30.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2: C = 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 cats.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If there are 15 cats, then there are 15 + 20 = 35 dogs.\n\nAnd 15 + 35 = 50, which matches the total number of students.\n\nYeah, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
