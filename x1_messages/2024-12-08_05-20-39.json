        "content": "Implementing a web scraper in Python using BeautifulSoup to extract information from a website, specifically product details from an e-commerce site, and then saving that data to a SQLite database with query functionality, involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\n\nFirst, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary libraries:\n\n- `beautifulsoup4` for web scraping.\n- `requests` to handle HTTP requests.\n- `sqlite3` for database operations.\n\nYou can install these using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install beautifulsoup4 requests\n```\n\n### Step 2: Write the Web Scraper\n\nCreate a Python script to scrape product details from the e-commerce site. For this example, let's assume you're scraping a site like Amazon or eBay. Replace the URL and selectors accordingly.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef scrape_products(url):\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    \n    products = []\n    for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='product'):  # Adjust the selector as needed\n        name = item.find('h2').text.strip()\n        price = item.find('span', class_='price').text.strip()\n        products.append({'name': name, 'price': price})\n    return products\n\n# Example usage\nurl = 'https://www.example.com/products'\nproducts = scrape_products(url)\nprint(products)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Set Up SQLite Database\n\nCreate a SQLite database to store the scraped product data.\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef create_table():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('products.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products\n                 (name TEXT, price TEXT)''')\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\ncreate_table()\n```\n\n### Step 4: Save Data to Database\n\nModify the scraper to insert the extracted data into the SQLite database.\n\n```python\ndef save_to_db(products):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('products.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    for product in products:\n        c.execute(\"INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (?, ?)\", (product['name'], product['price']))\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\n# After scraping\nsave_to_db(products)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Query Functionality\n\nProvide functionality to query the data based on user input. For example, allow users to search for products by name or price range.\n\n```python\ndef query_products(search_term):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('products.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    query = \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?\"\n    c.execute(query, ('%' + search_term + '%',))\n    results = c.fetchall()\n    conn.close()\n    return results\n\n# Example usage\nsearch_term = input(\"Enter product name to search: \")\nresults = query_products(search_term)\nfor row in results:\n    print(f\"Name: {row[0]}, Price: {row[1]}\")\n```\n\n### Step 6: Handle Pagination (Optional)\n\nIf the e-commerce site has multiple pages of products, you need to handle pagination.\n\n```python\ndef scrape_all_products(base_url, num_pages):\n    all_products = []\n    for page in range(1, num_pages + 1):\n        url = f\"{base_url}/page/{page}\"\n        products = scrape_products(url)\n        all_products.extend(products)\n    return all_products\n\n# Example usage\nbase_url = 'https://www.example.com/products'\nnum_pages = 5\nall_products = scrape_all_products(base_url, num_pages)\nsave_to_db(all_products)\n```\n\n### Step 7: Error Handling and Robustness\n\nAdd error handling to manage failures in HTTP requests or parsing.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef scrape_products(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n        products = []\n        for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='product'):\n            name = item.find('h2').text.strip()\n            price = item.find('span', class_='price').text.strip()\n            products.append({'name': name, 'price': price})\n        return products\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching {url}: {e}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing page: {e}\")\n    return []\n\n# Example usage\nurl = 'https://www.example.com/products'\nproducts = scrape_products(url)\nif products:\n    save_to_db(products)\nelse:\n    print(\"No products found or error occurred.\")\n```\n\n### Step 8: Respect Robots.txt and Terms of Service\n\nEnsure that the website allows scraping by checking its `robots.txt` file and terms of service. Some sites\u7981\u6b62 scraping or have specific rules you need to follow.\n\n### Step 9: Schedule Scraping (Optional)\n\nIf you need to keep the database updated, consider scheduling the scraper to run at regular intervals using a cron job or a task scheduler.\n\n### Final Script\n\nCombining all the steps, your final script might look like this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef scrape_products(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n        products = []\n        for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='product'):\n            name = item.find('h2').text.strip()\n            price = item.find('span', class_='price').text.strip()\n            products.append({'name': name, 'price': price})\n        return products\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching {url}: {e}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing page: {e}\")\n    return []\n\ndef create_table():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('products.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products\n                 (name TEXT, price TEXT)''')\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\ndef save_to_db(products):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('products.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    for product in products:\n        c.execute(\"INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (?, ?)\", (product['name'], product['price']))\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\ndef query_products(search_term):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('products.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    query = \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?\"\n    c.execute(query, ('%' + search_term + '%',))\n    results = c.fetchall()\n    conn.close()\n    return results\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    create_table()\n    \n    base_url = 'https://www.example.com/products'\n    num_pages = 5\n    all_products = []\n    for page in range(1, num_pages + 1):\n        url = f\"{base_url}/page/{page}\"\n        products = scrape_products(url)\n        all_products.extend(products)\n    \n    save_to_db(all_products)\n    \n    search_term = input(\"Enter product name to search: \")\n    results = query_products(search_term)\n    for row in results:\n        print(f\"Name: {row[0]}, Price: {row[1]}\")\n```\n\nThis script sets up a basic web scraper that extracts product names and prices from an e-commerce site, stores them in a SQLite database, and allows users to query the database based on product names. Make sure to adjust the selectors and URLs according to the target website's structure."
