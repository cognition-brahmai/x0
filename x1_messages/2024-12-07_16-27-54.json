        "content": "So, there are 4 cats in the room, and each cat can catch 3 mice in an hour. If it takes 2 hours for these 4 cats to catch all the mice, how many mice were there in the room?\n\nLet me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many mice one cat can catch in 2 hours. Since each cat can catch 3 mice in one hour, in 2 hours, one cat would catch:\n\n3 mice/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 6 mice\n\nNow, there are 4 cats, and each can catch 6 mice in 2 hours. So, the total number of mice caught by all 4 cats in 2 hours would be:\n\n4 cats \u00d7 6 mice/cat = 24 mice\n\nTherefore, there were 24 mice in the room.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach: If 4 cats catch mice at a rate of 3 mice per hour per cat, then together, they catch:\n\n4 cats \u00d7 3 mice/cat/hour = 12 mice/hour\n\nNow, if they hunt for 2 hours, the total number of mice caught would be:\n\n12 mice/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 24 mice\n\nYes, that matches my first calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this? Suppose the mice are somehow replenishing or something, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I'll assume the number of mice is fixed.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"catch all the mice in the room,\" so presumably, there are no mice left after 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total number of mice in the room was 24.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
