        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving Station A at 6 PM going towards Station B at 60 mph, and another leaving Station B at 7 PM going towards Station A at 80 mph. The distance between the stations is 420 miles. I need to find out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how far the first train has traveled by the time the second train starts at 7 PM. The first train leaves at 6 PM and travels at 60 mph, so by 7 PM, it would have traveled for 1 hour, covering 60 miles. That means the remaining distance between the two trains at 7 PM is 420 miles minus the 60 miles already covered by the first train, which is 360 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up. The first train is going at 60 mph and the second at 80 mph, so together they're closing the gap at 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nWith a remaining distance of 360 miles and a combined closing speed of 140 mph, the time it will take for them to meet is the distance divided by the speed, which is 360 miles divided by 140 mph. Let me calculate that: 360 divided by 140 is 2.5714 hours, which is 2 hours and about 34 minutes (since 0.5714 hours times 60 minutes is approximately 34 minutes).\n\nSo, if the second train leaves at 7 PM, and it takes approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes for the trains to meet, then the meeting time would be around 9:34 PM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the time traveled by each train. Let\u2019s denote the time traveled by the first train as t hours, so the second train travels for t - 1 hours (since it leaves an hour later).\n\nThe distance covered by the first train is 60t miles, and the distance covered by the second train is 80(t - 1) miles. The sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the stations, which is 420 miles.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n60t + 80(t - 1) = 420\n\nLet\u2019s solve for t:\n\n60t + 80t - 80 = 420\n\n140t - 80 = 420\n\n140t = 420 + 80\n\n140t = 500\n\nt = 500 / 140\n\nt = 3.5714 hours\n\nSo, the first train has been traveling for approximately 3 hours and 34 minutes when they meet.\n\nSince it left at 6 PM, adding 3 hours and 34 minutes would bring us to 9:34 PM.\n\nHmm, that's the same result as before. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of relative speed. Since the trains are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nBut, I need to account for the fact that the second train starts an hour later.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I can consider the first train's head start.\n\nIn one hour, the first train covers 60 miles, so the remaining distance is 420 - 60 = 360 miles.\n\nThen, with both trains moving towards each other at a combined speed of 140 mph, the time to cover 360 miles is 360 / 140 = 2.5714 hours, which is again 2 hours and 34 minutes.\n\nAdding this to the second train's start time of 7 PM gives 9:34 PM.\n\nSeems like all approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nWait, but maybe I should be more precise with the time calculation.\n\nLet's calculate 360 divided by 140 exactly.\n\n360 / 140 = 2.5714 hours.\n\nNow, 0.5714 hours times 60 minutes is 34.2857 minutes, which is approximately 34 minutes.\n\nSo, adding 2 hours and 34 minutes to 7 PM gives 9:34 PM.\n\nAlternatively, considering the first train has been traveling for t = 3.5714 hours, which is 3 hours and 34 minutes from 6 PM, also leading to 9:34 PM.\n\nTherefore, the trains will meet at approximately 9:34 PM.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9:34\\ \\text{PM}} \\]"
