The chain has a total of 10,000 rooms across all locations, with an average nightly rate of $150. During peak season, the occupancy rate is 90%, while during the off-season, it drops to 60%. Calculate the total annual revenue for the hotel chain, considering that peak season lasts for four months and the off-season lasts for eight months. Explain your reasoning."

        "content": "To calculate the total annual revenue for the hotel chain, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and consider the different occupancy rates during peak and off-seasons. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Determine the number of nights in peak and off-season:**\n   - Peak season lasts for 4 months.\n   - Off-season lasts for 8 months.\n   - Assuming each month has approximately 30 days, the number of nights in peak season is \\(4 \\times 30 = 120\\) nights.\n   - The number of nights in off-season is \\(8 \\times 30 = 240\\) nights.\n\n2. **Calculate the occupancy rates:**\n   - Peak season occupancy rate: 90%\n   - Off-season occupancy rate: 60%\n\n3. **Calculate the number of rooms occupied each night during peak and off-season:**\n   - Total rooms: 10,000\n   - Peak season occupied rooms per night: \\(10,000 \\times 0.90 = 9,000\\) rooms\n   - Off-season occupied rooms per night: \\(10,000 \\times 0.60 = 6,000\\) rooms\n\n4. **Calculate the nightly revenue during peak and off-season:**\n   - Average nightly rate: $150\n   - Peak season nightly revenue: \\(9,000 \\text{ rooms} \\times \\$150 = \\$1,350,000\\)\n   - Off-season nightly revenue: \\(6,000 \\text{ rooms} \\times \\$150 = \\$900,000\\)\n\n5. **Calculate the total revenue for peak and off-season:**\n   - Peak season total revenue: \\(120 \\text{ nights} \\times \\$1,350,000 = \\$162,000,000\\)\n   - Off-season total revenue: \\(240 \\text{ nights} \\times \\$900,000 = \\$216,000,000\\)\n\n6. **Calculate the total annual revenue:**\n   - Total annual revenue = Peak season revenue + Off-season revenue\n   - Total annual revenue = \\$162,000,000 + \\$216,000,000 = \\$378,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total annual revenue for the hotel chain is \\$378,000,000.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- We first determined the number of nights in each season by assuming 30 days per month.\n- Then, we calculated the number of rooms occupied each night based on the given occupancy rates.\n- Next, we found the nightly revenue by multiplying the number of occupied rooms by the average nightly rate.\n- We then calculated the total revenue for each season by multiplying the nightly revenue by the number of nights in that season.\n- Finally, we summed the revenues from both seasons to get the total annual revenue.\n\nThis method ensures that we account for the different occupancy rates and lengths of each season to accurately estimate the annual revenue."
