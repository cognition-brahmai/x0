        "content": "In the waning days of autumn's reign,  \nA symphony of colors did attain,  \nLeaves like flames in the breeze did sway,  \nPainting the world in hues of red and gold each day.\n\nThe air grew crisp, a\u9884\u5146 of things to come,  \nAs nature prepared for winter's numbing hum,  \nApples ripened on branches bare,  \nHarvested by hands with care and prayer.\n\nBut now, the season turns once more,  \nLeaves surrender to the winter's lore,  \nCrunching underfoot, a final farewell,  \nTo summer's warmth, now just a memory to tell.\n\nThe trees stand sentinel, their limbs outstretched,  \nBare against the sky, a stark, cold sketch,  \nSoon to be adorned with snow's pure grace,  \nTransformed into sculptures of winter's chaste pace.\n\nAutumn's last breath whispers through the night,  \nA gentle sigh, bidding farewell to light,  \nAs stars begin their vigil in the cold,  \nGuiding\u65c5\u4eba through landscapes bold.\n\nThe river slows, its current less bold,  \nReflecting the moon's serene, silver mold,  \nIcy tendrils creep along its edge,  \n\u9884\u793a\u7740\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5b63\u8282\u5373\u5c06\u63a5\u8e35\u800c\u81f3\u3002\n\nBut in this transition, there's a beauty rare,  \nA muted palette, yet still filled with care,  \nFor in the stillness, life persists,  \nHibernating, waiting for spring's first kiss.\n\nSo let us embrace this change so stark,  \nFind solace in the winter's heart,  \nFor every end is but a new beginning's door,  \nAnd nature's cycle forevermore."
