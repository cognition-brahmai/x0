        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with different colored marbles: 6 green, 4 yellow, and 10 blue. I need to find the probability that if I pick one marble at random, it's not green. Okay, probability questions can be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the basic formula for probability: the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking a marble that is not green, which means it could be either yellow or blue.\n\nSo, let's figure out the total number of marbles in the bag. There are 6 green, 4 yellow, and 10 blue marbles. Adding those up: 6 + 4 + 10 = 20 marbles in total.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of yellow and blue marbles combined, since those are the ones that are not green. So, 4 yellow + 10 blue = 14 marbles that are not green.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a marble that is not green is 14 (not green marbles) divided by 20 (total marbles), which is 14/20.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2: 14 \u00f7 2 = 7, and 20 \u00f7 2 = 10. So, 7/10.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this in terms of complementary probabilities. The probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of it happening. So, the probability of not picking green is 1 minus the probability of picking green.\n\nThe probability of picking green is the number of green marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 6/20, which simplifies to 3/10.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking green is 1 - 3/10 = 7/10.\n\nBoth methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the probability is 7/10.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the probability that it is not green. I think I've got it right, but let's double-check.\n\nTotal marbles: 20\n\nNot green marbles: 14\n\nProbability: 14/20 = 7/10\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using decimal or percentage:\n\n7/10 is the same as 0.7, or 70%.\n\nSo, there's a 70% chance that the marble picked is not green.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{10}} \\]"
