        "content": "Let's tackle this bacterial growth problem step by step. So, we've got a bacterial colony that doubles in size every hour. We're starting with an initial population of 50 bacteria, and we want to know how many there will be after 6 hours.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what it means for the colony to double every hour. That means that every 60 minutes, the number of bacteria increases by a factor of 2. So, if we have X bacteria at a certain hour, the next hour we'll have 2X.\n\nGiven that, we can approach this in a few ways. One straightforward method is to calculate the population hour by hour for 6 hours. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with 50 bacteria at hour 0.\n\nAfter 1 hour: 50 * 2 = 100 bacteria.\n\nAfter 2 hours: 100 * 2 = 200 bacteria.\n\nAfter 3 hours: 200 * 2 = 400 bacteria.\n\nAfter 4 hours: 400 * 2 = 800 bacteria.\n\nAfter 5 hours: 800 * 2 = 1600 bacteria.\n\nAfter 6 hours: 1600 * 2 = 3200 bacteria.\n\nSo, after 6 hours, there would be 3200 bacteria.\n\nBut let's verify this with a different approach to make sure we're accurate. We can use the formula for exponential growth, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Population} = \\text{Initial Population} \\times (\\text{growth rate})^{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the initial population is 50, the growth rate is 2 (since it doubles), and the time is 6 hours.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Population} = 50 \\times 2^{6} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 2^{6} \\):\n\n\\[ 2^{6} = 64 \\]\n\nThen multiply by the initial population:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 64 = 3200 \\]\n\nSo, again, we get 3200 bacteria after 6 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, does \"doubles in size every hour\" mean something different than multiplying by 2 each hour? In standard exponential growth scenarios, doubling means multiplying by 2, so I think our approach is correct.\n\nAlso, ensure that the time frame is correctly understood. The problem states \"every hour,\" and we're looking at a total of 6 hours. So, the growth occurs at the end of each hour for 6 consecutive hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the population at each hour:\n\n- Hour 0: 50\n\n- Hour 1: 50 * 2 = 100\n\n- Hour 2: 100 * 2 = 200\n\n- Hour 3: 200 * 2 = 400\n\n- Hour 4: 400 * 2 = 800\n\n- Hour 5: 800 * 2 = 1600\n\n- Hour 6: 1600 * 2 = 3200\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nLet's also consider if the initial population is included as time 0 or if it starts growing immediately. In this case, since it's specified as the initial population, it makes sense to consider it at time 0, with the first doubling occurring after the first hour.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to use a general exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times e^{rt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P(t) \\) is the population at time t\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population\n\n- r is the growth rate\n\n- t is time\n\nHowever, in this scenario, since the population doubles every hour, using base 2 is more straightforward than using the natural exponent e. But for completeness, if we were to find r such that \\( 2 = e^{r \\times 1} \\), then \\( r = \\ln(2) \\), and the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ P(t) = 50 \\times e^{(\\ln(2) \\times t)} \\]\n\nSimplifying, since \\( e^{\\ln(2) \\times t} = 2^{t} \\), we're back to the same formula:\n\n\\[ P(t) = 50 \\times 2^{t} \\]\n\nSo, for t=6:\n\n\\[ P(6) = 50 \\times 2^{6} = 50 \\times 64 = 3200 \\]\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, we arrive at the same conclusion: there will be 3200 bacteria after 6 hours.\n\nJust to double-check our arithmetic:\n\n50 multiplied by 64 is indeed 3200.\n\n- 50 * 60 = 3000\n\n- 50 * 4 = 200\n\n- Total: 3000 + 200 = 3200\n\nNo errors there.\n\nIn summary, starting with 50 bacteria that double every hour, after 6 hours, the population will be 3200 bacteria.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3200} \\]"
