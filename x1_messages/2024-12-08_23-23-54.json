        "content": "Let's see. There are 40 students in the class. 25% of them play basketball, so that means 25% of 40 is 10 students play basketball. 30% play soccer, so 30% of 40 is 12 students play soccer. Now, 5 students play both sports.\n\nTo find out how many students play either basketball or soccer or both, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That means we add the number of students who play basketball and the number who play soccer, and then subtract the number who play both, because they were counted twice.\n\nSo, it's 10 + 12 - 5 = 17 students who play either basketball or soccer or both.\n\nNow, to find out how many students do not play either sport, we subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nThat is 40 - 17 = 23 students.\n\nSo, 23 students do not play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]"
