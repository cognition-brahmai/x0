        "content": "So there's this problem about probabilities with balls of different colors in a box. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 5 green balls in the box. So, the total number of balls in the box would be 4 plus 6 plus 5. Let's calculate that: 4 + 6 is 10, and then plus 5 makes 15 balls in total.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability of picking a red or a blue ball. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes would be the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls. That's 4 red plus 6 blue, which equals 10 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 10 divided by 15. But I can simplify that fraction. Both 10 and 15 are divisible by 5. So, 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, the simplified fraction is 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it another way to confirm. The probability of picking a red ball is 4/15, and the probability of picking a blue ball is 6/15. So, the probability of picking either red or blue should be the sum of these two probabilities, since these are mutually exclusive events (you can't pick a ball that's both red and blue at the same time).\n\nSo, 4/15 plus 6/15 is equal to 10/15, which again simplifies to 2/3.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I think 2/3 is the correct probability.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider the probability of picking a green ball. There are 5 green balls out of 15 total balls, so the probability of picking a green ball is 5/15, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nSince the only possible outcomes are picking a red, blue, or green ball, the probabilities should add up to 1. So, probability of red or blue is 2/3, and green is 1/3. Indeed, 2/3 plus 1/3 equals 1, which makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 1 minus the probability of not picking a red or blue ball, which means picking a green ball. So, 1 minus 1/3 is 2/3, which again confirms my answer.\n\nI think I've approached this from a few different angles and keep getting 2/3 as the probability of picking a red or blue ball. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
