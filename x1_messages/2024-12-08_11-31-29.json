        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular garden that's 20 feet by 30 feet, and it's surrounded by a walkway of uniform width. The area of just the walkway is 600 square feet, and we need to find out how wide this walkway is.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. There's a garden that's rectangular, with lengths 20 ft and 30 ft. Around this garden, there's a walkway that's the same width all around. So, if I imagine the garden with the walkway, it's like a bigger rectangle with the garden inside it.\n\nLet me denote the width of the walkway as \\(w\\). Since the walkway surrounds the garden uniformly, it adds \\(w\\) feet to each side of the garden. That means:\n\n- The length of the entire area (garden plus walkway) would be \\(30 + 2w\\) feet. We add \\(w\\) to both ends of the length.\n\n- Similarly, the width of the entire area would be \\(20 + 2w\\) feet. Again, adding \\(w\\) to both sides of the width.\n\nNow, the area of the entire region (garden plus walkway) would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = (30 + 2w) \\times (20 + 2w) \\quad \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\nThe area of just the garden is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Garden area} = 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\quad \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\nThe area of the walkway is the difference between the total area and the garden area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Walkway area} = \\text{Total area} - \\text{Garden area} = (30 + 2w)(20 + 2w) - 600 = 600 \\quad \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, the problem says the area of the walkway is 600 square feet, and the garden area is also 600 square feet. So, the total area would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = \\text{Garden area} + \\text{Walkway area} = 600 + 600 = 1200 \\quad \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n(30 + 2w)(20 + 2w) = 1200\n\\]\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n\\[\n(30 + 2w)(20 + 2w) = 30 \\times 20 + 30 \\times 2w + 20 \\times 2w + 2w \\times 2w = 600 + 60w + 40w + 4w^2 = 4w^2 + 100w + 600\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 + 100w + 600 = 1200\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1200 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 + 100w + 600 - 1200 = 0 \\implies 4w^2 + 100w - 600 = 0\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 25w - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for \\(w\\). I can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 25\\), and \\(c = -150\\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{25^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-150)}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{625 + 600}}{2} = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{1225}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{1225} = 35\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-25 \\pm 35}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\(w = \\frac{-25 + 35}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\\)\n\n2. \\(w = \\frac{-25 - 35}{2} = \\frac{-60}{2} = -30\\)\n\nSince width cannot be negative, we discard \\(w = -30\\). Therefore, the width of the walkway is 5 feet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this result. If \\(w = 5\\) feet, then:\n\n- The total length is \\(30 + 2 \\times 5 = 40\\) feet\n\n- The total width is \\(20 + 2 \\times 5 = 30\\) feet\n\n- The total area is \\(40 \\times 30 = 1200\\) square feet\n\n- The garden area is \\(30 \\times 20 = 600\\) square feet\n\n- So, the walkway area is \\(1200 - 600 = 600\\) square feet, which matches the given information.\n\nTherefore, the width of the walkway is indeed 5 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
