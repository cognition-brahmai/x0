It's about having the courage to be who you are, even when it's difficult.\n\nRemember, Mulan disguised herself as a man to join the army because she wanted to protect her father. She had to hide her true identity to achieve her goals. But in the end, it was her uniqueness and her true self that saved the day.\n\nSo, to stay true to yourself, you need to have the courage to be who you are, just like Mulan. Don't be afraid to stand up for what you believe in, even if it's not the popular choice.\n\nAlso, remember that it's okay to make mistakes. Mulan made mistakes along her journey, but she learned from them and grew stronger. So, don't be too hard on yourself if you make a mistake. Use it as an opportunity to learn and improve.\n\nLastly, always remember why you started. Mulan's motivation was to protect her family and honor her ancestors. Whatever your motivation is, keep it close to your heart and let it guide you.\n\nSo, stay strong, stay true, and always believe in yourself, just like Mulan."
