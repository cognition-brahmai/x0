Implementing a function to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings using dynamic programming is a great way to understand both string manipulation and dynamic programming concepts.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguously. For example, in the string \"ABC\", \"AC\" is a subsequence, but \"CA\" is not because the order is not maintained.\n\nThe longest common subsequence between two strings is the longest sequence that is a subsequence of both strings. For example, given the strings \"ABCBDAB\" and \"BDCAB\", the LCS is \"BCAB\".\n\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and using the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends on the optimal solution to its subproblems.\n\nTo solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use a 2D array to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences of substrings of the input strings. We'll build this array iteratively, and the value in the bottom-right corner of the array will be the length of the LCS.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Create a 2D array `dp` of size `(len(text1)+1) x (len(text2)+1)`, initialized with zeros. The extra row and column are for the base case when one of the strings is empty.\n\n2. Iterate through each cell of the array. For each cell `dp[i][j]`, which corresponds to the substrings `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`:\n\n   a. If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.\n\n   b. Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.\n\n3. After filling the array, `dp[len(text1)][len(text2)]` will hold the length of the LCS.\n\n4. To reconstruct the LCS itself, we can backtrack through the `dp` array starting from `dp[len(text1)][len(text2)]` and collect the characters that matched.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef longestCommonSubsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> str:\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    # Create a 2D array for storing lengths of LCS of substrings\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Fill the dp array\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # Reconstruct the LCS\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(text1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    lcs.reverse()\n    return ''.join(lcs)\n```\n\nThis function first computes the lengths of the LCS for all substrings of `text1` and `text2` using the dynamic programming approach. Then, it backtracks through the `dp` array to reconstruct the actual LCS.\n\nYou can test this function with the example strings \"ABCBDAB\" and \"BDCAB\" to see that it returns \"BCAB\". This should give you a good starting point for understanding how dynamic programming can be applied to string problems.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve the problem of finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings using dynamic programming, we can use a 2D array to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences of substrings of the input strings. By building this array iteratively, we can determine the LCS length and reconstruct the LCS itself by backtracking through the array.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings `text1` and `text2`, respectively. This array will store the lengths of the LCS of substrings of `text1` and `text2`.\n\n2. **Filling the dp array**:\n   - If characters `text1[i-1]` and `text2[j-1]` match, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.\n   - If they do not match, set `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.\n\n3. **Reconstructing the LCS**: Starting from `dp[m][n]`, trace back to construct the LCS by:\n   - Adding the character to the result if characters match.\n   - Moving to the cell with the larger value if characters do not match.\n\n4. **Return the LCS**: Reverse the constructed list to get the correct order and join it into a string.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef longestCommonSubsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> str:\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    # Create a 2D array for storing lengths of LCS of substrings\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Fill the dp array\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # Reconstruct the LCS\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(text1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    lcs.reverse()\n    return ''.join(lcs)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **DP Array Construction**:\n   - The `dp` array is initialized to zero.\n   - For each character in `text1` and `text2`, if they match, the DP value is set based on the diagonal value plus one.\n   - If they do not match, the DP value is the maximum of the value above or to the left.\n\n2. **Reconstructing the LCS**:\n   - Start from the bottom-right corner of the DP array.\n   - If characters match, add the character to the LCS and move diagonally up-left.\n   - If not, move up or left based on which adjacent cell has a larger value.\n   \n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - Reverse the list of characters to get the correct order and join them into a string to form the LCS.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the LCS using dynamic programming with a time complexity of \\( O(m \\times n) \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are the lengths of the input strings."
