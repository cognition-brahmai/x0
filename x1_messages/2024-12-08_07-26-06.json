        "content": "Let's see. There's this group trying to raise $10,000 for charity. On the first day, they raised $1,500. And each day after that, they raise 20% more than the day before. I need to figure out how many days it will take for them to reach their goal.\n\nOkay, so this sounds like a problem involving geometric sequences because each day they're raising 20% more than the previous day. That means each day's contribution is multiplied by 1.20 compared to the day before.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence. The sum S of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a = $1,500 and r = 1.20.\n\nSo, the total amount raised after n days would be:\n\nS = 1500 * (1 - 1.20^n) / (1 - 1.20)\n\nBut wait, 1 - 1.20 is negative, which might complicate things. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since each day they raise 20% more than the previous day, the amounts form a geometric series:\n\nDay 1: $1,500\n\nDay 2: $1,500 * 1.20\n\nDay 3: $1,500 * 1.20^2\n\nAnd so on, up to day n: $1,500 * 1.20^(n-1)\n\nThe sum after n days is S = 1500 * (1 - 1.20^n) / (1 - 1.20)\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\nS = 1500 * (1 - 1.20^n) / (-0.20)\n\nS = 1500 / (-0.20) * (1 - 1.20^n)\n\nS = -7500 * (1 - 1.20^n)\n\nS = 7500 * (1.20^n - 1)\n\nWe want S to be at least $10,000.\n\nSo, 7500 * (1.20^n - 1) >= 10,000\n\nLet me solve for n.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 7500:\n\n1.20^n - 1 >= 10,000 / 7,500\n\n1.20^n - 1 >= 10/7.5\n\n10/7.5 simplifies to 4/3, which is approximately 1.333...\n\nSo, 1.20^n - 1 >= 1.333...\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n1.20^n >= 2.333...\n\nNow, to solve for n, I can take the logarithm of both sides.\n\nLet's use natural logarithms.\n\nln(1.20^n) >= ln(2.333...)\n\nBy the properties of logarithms, ln(a^b) = b * ln(a)\n\nSo, n * ln(1.20) >= ln(2.333...)\n\nNow, ln(1.20) is a positive number because 1.20 > 1.\n\nSo, I can divide both sides by ln(1.20) without changing the inequality direction.\n\nn >= ln(2.333...) / ln(1.20)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, ln(2.333...) = ln(7/3) = ln(7) - ln(3) \u2248 1.9459 - 1.0986 \u2248 0.8473\n\nLn(1.20) \u2248 0.1823\n\nSo, n >= 0.8473 / 0.1823 \u2248 4.64\n\nSince n has to be a whole number (days are whole numbers), I need to round up to the next whole day.\n\nSo, n = 5 days.\n\nBut let me check that.\n\nCalculate the sum after 5 days:\n\nS = 7500 * (1.20^5 - 1)\n\nFirst, 1.20^5 = 2.48832\n\nSo, S = 7500 * (2.48832 - 1) = 7500 * 1.48832 = 11,162.40\n\nWhich is more than $10,000.\n\nWhat about after 4 days?\n\nS = 7500 * (1.20^4 - 1)\n\n1.20^4 = 2.0736\n\nS = 7500 * (2.0736 - 1) = 7500 * 1.0736 = 8,052\n\nWhich is less than $10,000.\n\nSo, it looks like it takes 5 days to reach the goal.\n\nWait a minute, but the calculation earlier suggested n >= 4.64, so rounding up to 5 days seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to model this.\n\nPerhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series is the most accurate approach.\n\nLet me confirm the sum after 5 days again.\n\nDay 1: 1500\n\nDay 2: 1500 * 1.20 = 1800\n\nDay 3: 1800 * 1.20 = 2160\n\nDay 4: 2160 * 1.20 = 2592\n\nDay 5: 2592 * 1.20 = 3110.40\n\nTotal: 1500 + 1800 + 2160 + 2592 + 3110.40 = 11,162.40\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, it takes 5 days for them to reach their $10,000 goal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
