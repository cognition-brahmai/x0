        "content": "So there are 25 red balls and 15 blue balls in a box, and I need to find the probability of picking a red ball randomly. Okay, probability is basically the chance of something happening, right? So in this case, the chance of picking a red ball.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. There are 25 red and 15 blue, so total balls would be 25 plus 15, which is 40 balls.\n\nNow, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this scenario, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total possible outcomes are picking any ball from the box.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball (which I'll denote as P(red)) should be the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. That is:\n\nP(red) = Number of red balls / Total number of balls = 25 / 40\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n\n40 \u00f7 5 = 8\n\nSo, P(red) = 5/8\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a better understanding. 5 divided by 8 is 0.625.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/8 or 0.625. To express it as a percentage, I can multiply by 100, which would be 62.5%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. There are 25 red balls out of 40 total balls. So, 25 divided by 40 is indeed 0.625, and that matches the fraction 5/8.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that more than half the balls are red since 25 out of 40 is more than 20 out of 40, which would be 0.5 or 50%. So, 62.5% seems reasonable because it's more than half.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also think about the probability of picking a blue ball and see if both probabilities add up to 100%. The number of blue balls is 15, so P(blue) = 15/40.\n\nSimplifying 15/40 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5: 15 \u00f7 5 = 3, and 40 \u00f7 5 = 8. So, P(blue) = 3/8.\n\nIn decimal form, 3 divided by 8 is 0.375, or 37.5%.\n\nNow, if I add P(red) and P(blue): 62.5% + 37.5% = 100%, which makes sense because these are the only two colors of balls in the box. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if there were more colors, the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes should equal 1 or 100%.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only red and blue balls, and their probabilities add up to 100%, I can be confident that my calculation for P(red) is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red ball is 5/8, or 0.625, or 62.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}} \\]"
