        "content": "So the restaurant serves about 200 customers each day, and each customer spends an average of $15 on their meal. It operates 6 days a week. We need to find out how much revenue the restaurant makes in a year.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the daily revenue. If 200 customers each spend $15, then the daily revenue would be 200 multiplied by $15, right? So that's 200 * 15 = $3,000 per day.\n\nNext, since the restaurant is open 6 days a week, the weekly revenue would be $3,000 per day times 6 days. So, 3,000 * 6 = $18,000 per week.\n\nNow, to find the annual revenue, we need to know how many weeks there are in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year. So, if the restaurant makes $18,000 each week, then in a year, it would be 18,000 * 52.\n\nLet me calculate that: 18,000 * 52.\n\nFirst, 18,000 * 50 = 900,000.\n\nThen, 18,000 * 2 = 36,000.\n\nAdding those together, 900,000 + 36,000 = $936,000.\n\nSo, the restaurant makes approximately $936,000 in a year.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the total number of days the restaurant is open in a year.\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year, and it's open 6 days a week, so 52 * 6 = 312 days per year.\n\nThen, with 200 customers per day, the total number of customers in a year would be 312 * 200 = 62,400 customers.\n\nEach customer spends $15, so the total revenue would be 62,400 * 15.\n\nLet's do that calculation: 62,400 * 15.\n\nFirst, 60,000 * 15 = 900,000.\n\nThen, 2,400 * 15 = 36,000.\n\nAdding them up, 900,000 + 36,000 = $936,000.\n\nSo, both methods give us the same result. The restaurant makes about $936,000 in a year.\n\nBut, maybe we should consider if there are any leap years or extra days. A year has 365 days, and if we calculate based on 312 days (6 days a week), it might not account for every possible operating day.\n\nLet me check. 52 weeks have 364 days, and there's one extra day in a non-leap year. So, depending on that extra day, the restaurant might operate one more day.\n\nBut since it's open 6 days a week, and 52 weeks already account for 312 days, plus possibly one more if the extra day is one of its operating days.\n\nTo keep it simple, perhaps it's acceptable to use the 312 days per year.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate based on the actual number of days in a year.\n\nThere are 365 days in a non-leap year. If the restaurant is open 6 days a week, that's closing one day a week.\n\nAssuming it's closed one day each week, then in 365 days, the number of operating days would be 365 - (365 / 7), since there are 52 weeks plus one extra day.\n\nWait, 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and one day, so total closed days would be 52 + 1 = 53 days.\n\nTherefore, operating days would be 365 - 53 = 312 days.\n\nSo, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant operates 312 days a year, serving 200 customers per day, at $15 per customer.\n\nSo, total revenue is 312 * 200 * 15 = 312 * 3,000 = $936,000.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a leap year with 366 days, then closed days would be 52 weeks plus two extra days.\n\nAssuming it closes one day per week, then closed days would be 52 + 2 = 54 days.\n\nTherefore, operating days would be 366 - 54 = 312 days.\n\nSo, even in a leap year, it's still 312 operating days.\n\nTherefore, the annual revenue remains $936,000.\n\nUnless, of course, there are holidays or other days when the restaurant might close beyond the regular schedule.\n\nBut based on the information provided, we can assume it's open 6 days a week, 52 weeks a year, which amounts to 312 days.\n\nHence, the restaurant's annual revenue is approximately $936,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{936000} \\]"
