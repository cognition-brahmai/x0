        "content": "So the car travels 120 miles in 3 hours, right? First, I need to find out how fast the car is going. Speed is distance divided by time, so 120 miles divided by 3 hours equals 40 miles per hour. That means the car is going 40 miles every hour.\n\nNow, if the car continues at the same speed for another 2 hours, I need to find out how far it will go in those 2 hours. Since it's going 40 miles per hour, in 2 hours it would travel 40 miles/hour times 2 hours, which is 80 miles.\n\nSo, to find the total distance traveled, I need to add the initial 120 miles to the additional 80 miles. That's 120 plus 80, which equals 200 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by finding the total time traveled and then multiplying by the speed. The total time is 3 hours plus 2 hours, which is 5 hours. At 40 miles per hour, 5 hours times 40 miles per hour is also 200 miles. Yeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the speed. 120 miles in 3 hours is indeed 40 miles per hour because 120 divided by 3 is 40. And then, traveling for another 2 hours at 40 miles per hour is 80 miles. Adding that to the original 120 miles gives 200 miles.\n\nAlternatively, you could set up a proportion or use the formula distance equals speed multiplied by time. We know the speed is 40 miles per hour, and the total time is 5 hours, so distance is 40 times 5, which is 200 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer: the car will travel a total of 200 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]\n"
