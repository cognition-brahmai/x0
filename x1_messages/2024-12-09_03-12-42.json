        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store selling apples and oranges by the pound. Apples are $2 per pound, and oranges are $3 per pound. A customer buys a total of 10 pounds of fruit, a mix of both apples and oranges, and spends exactly $25. We need to find out how many pounds of each fruit they bought.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the pounds of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the pounds of oranges.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total weight of fruit is 10 pounds.\n\n2. The total cost is $25.\n\nSo, I can write these as:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 10 \\) pounds.\n\n2. \\( 2a + 3o = 25 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I need to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( o \\).\n\nI can start by solving the first equation for one of the variables, say \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 10 - o \\).\n\nThen, I can substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 2(10 - o) + 3o = 25 \\).\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for \\( o \\):\n\n\\( 20 - 2o + 3o = 25 \\),\n\n\\( 20 + o = 25 \\),\n\n\\( o = 25 - 20 \\),\n\n\\( o = 5 \\).\n\nSo, the customer bought 5 pounds of oranges.\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 10 - 5 = 5 \\).\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. So, both apples and oranges are 5 pounds each. But let me check if this satisfies both equations.\n\nFirst equation: \\( 5 + 5 = 10 \\), which is correct.\n\nSecond equation: \\( 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \\), which matches the total cost.\n\nSo, it seems that the customer bought 5 pounds of apples and 5 pounds of oranges.\n\nBut let's think about it again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using substitution or elimination method.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the elimination method. Let's write the equations again:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 10 \\).\n\n2. \\( 2a + 3o = 25 \\).\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\( a \\):\n\n\\( 2a + 2o = 20 \\).\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n\\( (2a + 3o) - (2a + 2o) = 25 - 20 \\),\n\n\\( 2a + 3o - 2a - 2o = 5 \\),\n\n\\( o = 5 \\).\n\nAgain, I get \\( o = 5 \\), and then \\( a = 5 \\).\n\nAnother way could be to think in terms of the average cost per pound. The total cost is $25 for 10 pounds, so the average cost per pound is \\( 25 / 10 = $2.50 \\) per pound.\n\nNow, apples are $2 per pound, and oranges are $3 per pound. The average is $2.50, which is right in the middle, suggesting equal amounts of both fruits, which aligns with my previous result of 5 pounds each.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of weighted averages. The difference between the average price and the price of apples is $0.50, and the difference between the orange price and the average is also $0.50. Since these differences are equal, the pounds of apples and oranges must be equal, leading again to 5 pounds each.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the extra cost incurred by choosing oranges over apples, each pound of oranges costs $1 more than apples ($3 - $2 = $1). The total extra cost is the difference between the total cost at apple price and the actual total cost.\n\nWait, let's think differently. If all 10 pounds were apples, the total cost would be \\( 10 \\times 2 = $20 \\). But the customer spent $25, which is $5 more than $20.\n\nSince each pound of oranges costs $1 more than apples, the extra $5 must have come from buying oranges instead of apples. So, the number of pounds of oranges is \\( 5 / 1 = 5 \\) pounds.\n\nTherefore, oranges are 5 pounds, and apples are \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\) pounds.\n\nAll these different approaches lead to the same conclusion: the customer bought 5 pounds of apples and 5 pounds of oranges.\n\nI think it's safe to say that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ pounds of apples and } 5 \\text{ pounds of oranges}} \\]"
