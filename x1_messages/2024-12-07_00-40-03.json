        "content": "So in this problem, we have a town with 100 people. Out of these, 45 own cats, 30 own dogs, and 20 own both cats and dogs. We need to find out how many people don't own any pets.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many people own at least one pet, whether it's a cat or a dog or both. Then, I can subtract that number from the total number of people to find out how many own no pets.\n\nI recall that when dealing with overlapping groups, like people who own both cats and dogs, I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That means I add the number of cat owners and dog owners and then subtract the number of people who own both, to avoid double-counting those people.\n\nSo, the number of people who own at least one pet would be:\n\nNumber of cat owners + Number of dog owners - Number of people who own both cats and dogs.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n45 (cat owners) + 30 (dog owners) - 20 (both) = 55 people own at least one pet.\n\nNow, to find out how many people don't own any pets, I subtract the number of pet owners from the total number of people:\n\n100 (total people) - 55 (pet owners) = 45 people don't own any pets.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n45 + 30 is 75, and then subtracting 20 for the overlap gives me 55. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sets. Let's say set C is the set of cat owners, and set D is the set of dog owners. The number of people who own either a cat or a dog or both is the union of sets C and D, which is denoted as C \u222a D.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|C \u222a D| = |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |C| is the number of cat owners (45),\n\n- |D| is the number of dog owners (30),\n\n- |C \u2229 D| is the number of people who own both cats and dogs (20).\n\nSo, |C \u222a D| = 45 + 30 - 20 = 55.\n\nThen, the number of people who don't own any pets is the total number of people minus those who own at least one pet:\n\n100 - 55 = 45.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the number of people who own only cats, only dogs, and both, and then see how that adds up.\n\nNumber of people who own only cats: 45 (cat owners) - 20 (both) = 25.\n\nNumber of people who own only dogs: 30 (dog owners) - 20 (both) = 10.\n\nNumber of people who own both: 20.\n\nSo, total pet owners: 25 (only cats) + 10 (only dogs) + 20 (both) = 55.\n\nAgain, 100 - 55 = 45 people without any pets.\n\nI think this is consistent across different approaches, so I'm confident that the answer is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
