Ghostly ghouls giggled grotesquely, greeting guests generously. Green grass grew gracefully, guarding gentle gardens. Glorious gusts gushed gently, guiding graceful globes. Global governance guaranteed growth, granting global greatness. Government guaranteed guaranteed gains, generating global goodwill. Greatness grew grandly, guaranteeing global glory."
