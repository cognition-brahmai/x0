        "content": "So I have this problem: \"Prove that if n is an odd integer, then n squared is also odd.\" Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for an integer to be odd. An odd integer is one that is not divisible by 2, meaning when you divide it by 2, there's a remainder. For example, numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on are odd.\n\nNow, how can I express an odd integer mathematically? I remember that any integer can be expressed in terms of 2k or 2k+1, where k is an integer. Even integers are of the form 2k, and odd integers are of the form 2k+1. So, if n is odd, I can write n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nAlright, so n = 2k + 1. Now, I need to find n squared, which is n^2. Let's compute that:\n\nn^2 = (2k + 1)^2\n\nI know that (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So applying that here:\n\nn^2 = (2k)^2 + 2*(2k)*1 + 1^2\n     = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n\nNow, I need to show that this is also an odd integer. Recall that an odd integer can be expressed as 2m + 1, where m is an integer.\n\nLooking at n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1, I can factor out a 2:\n\nn^2 = 2*(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\n\nLet me set m = 2k^2 + 2k, which is an integer since k is an integer. Therefore:\n\nn^2 = 2m + 1\n\nThis is exactly the form of an odd integer. Therefore, if n is odd, then n squared is also odd.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using properties of even and odd numbers.\n\nI know that:\n\n- Even * even = even\n\n- Even * odd = even\n\n- Odd * odd = odd\n\nSince n is odd, n squared is n * n, which is odd times odd, so it should be odd.\n\nBut then again, this seems more like a property I've memorized rather than a proof. Maybe I should think about it in terms of modular arithmetic.\n\nIn modulo 2 arithmetic:\n\n- Even numbers are congruent to 0 mod 2\n\n- Odd numbers are congruent to 1 mod 2\n\nSo, if n is odd, n \u2261 1 mod 2\n\nThen n^2 \u2261 1^2 \u2261 1 mod 2\n\nWhich means n^2 is also odd.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I'm not sure if that's a complete proof.\n\nLet me compare this to the first method I used, where I expressed n as 2k + 1 and showed that n^2 is of the form 2m + 1.\n\nThat seems more rigorous, but the modular arithmetic approach is quicker.\n\nMaybe I can use both in my proof to cover different aspects.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider a proof by contradiction.\n\nSuppose n is odd, but n^2 is even.\n\nThen, since n is odd, n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nThen n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n\nBut suppose n^2 is even, so n^2 = 2m for some integer m.\n\nSo, 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2m\n\nBut the left side is 2*(2k^2 + 2k) + 1, which is 2m, meaning:\n\n2*(2k^2 + 2k) + 1 = 2m\n\nSubtracting 2*(2k^2 + 2k) from both sides:\n\n1 = 2m - 2*(2k^2 + 2k)\n\n1 = 2*(m - (2k^2 + 2k))\n\nThis implies that 1 is divisible by 2, which is a contradiction because 1 is not even.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that n^2 is even must be false.\n\nHence, if n is odd, n^2 is odd.\n\nThis seems like a valid proof by contradiction.\n\nMaybe I can also consider specific examples to illustrate the point.\n\nFor example, let n = 3 (which is odd).\n\nThen n^2 = 9, which is also odd.\n\nAnother example: n = 5, n^2 = 25, which is odd.\n\nn = 7, n^2 = 49, odd.\n\nThis seems to hold for these cases, but of course, examples don't constitute a proof. They just help to illustrate the concept.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the binary representation of odd numbers.\n\nIn binary, an odd number always ends with a 1.\n\nWhen you square it, the last bit of the result will also be 1, meaning it's odd.\n\nBut again, this is more of an intuitive understanding rather than a formal proof.\n\nI think the first method I used, expressing n as 2k + 1 and showing that n^2 is of the form 2m + 1, is the most straightforward and rigorous way to prove this.\n\nLet me try to write it up cleanly.\n\nProof:\n\nLet n be an odd integer. Then, by definition, there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1.\n\nNow, compute n^2:\n\nn^2 = (2k + 1)^2\n\n     = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n\n     = 2*(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\n\nLet m = 2k^2 + 2k, which is an integer since k is an integer.\n\nTherefore, n^2 = 2m + 1, which is the definition of an odd integer.\n\nHence, if n is odd, then n^2 is also odd.\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nThat seems clear and concise. I think this suffices to prove the statement.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any special cases I need to consider.\n\nFor example, what if n is negative? Does the proof still hold?\n\nWell, negative odd integers can be expressed as n = - (2k + 1), where k is an integer.\n\nThen n^2 = [-(2k + 1)]^2 = (2k + 1)^2, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, the proof still holds for negative odd integers.\n\nWhat about n = 0? Wait, 0 is even, not odd, because it's divisible by 2.\n\nSo, no need to consider n = 0 in this proof.\n\nAnother consideration: is there any restriction on k? No, k can be any integer, positive or negative.\n\nI think this covers all cases.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using induction.\n\nLet's see: base case, maybe n = 1 (the smallest positive odd integer).\n\n1^2 = 1, which is odd. So, base case holds.\n\nInductive step: assume that for some odd integer n, n^2 is odd.\n\nNeed to show that (n + 2)^2 is also odd, since the next odd integer after n is n + 2.\n\nCompute (n + 2)^2:\n\n(n + 2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4\n\n          = n^2 + 4(n + 1)\n\nSince n is odd, n + 1 is even, so 4(n + 1) is even.\n\nAnd n^2 is odd by the inductive hypothesis.\n\nOdd + even = odd.\n\nTherefore, (n + 2)^2 is odd.\n\nHence, by induction, for all odd integers n, n^2 is odd.\n\nThis is another valid proof using mathematical induction.\n\nHowever, the first method is simpler and more direct, so I think that's preferable.\n\nIn summary, there are multiple ways to prove this statement, but the most straightforward is to express n as 2k + 1 and show that n^2 is of the form 2m + 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{If } n \\text{ is an odd integer, then } n^2 \\text{ is also odd.}} \\]"
