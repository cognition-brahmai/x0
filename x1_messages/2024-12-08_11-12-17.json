        "content": "So I have this problem here: if it takes 6 workers 4 hours to build a fence, how long would it take for 12 workers to build the same fence? Hmm, this seems like a problem about work and how the number of workers affects the time needed to complete a task.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time they take to complete the job. Intuitively, if you have more workers, it should take less time to finish the same job, right? So, there's an inverse relationship between the number of workers and the time taken.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. If 6 workers take 4 hours, then the total amount of work can be thought of as \"worker-hours.\" So, the total work required to build the fence is 6 workers multiplied by 4 hours, which is 24 worker-hours.\n\nNow, if I have 12 workers, I need to find out how many hours it would take for them to complete the same 24 worker-hours of work. Let's denote the time taken by 12 workers as T hours. So, the total work would be 12 workers multiplied by T hours, which should equal the total work required, which is 24 worker-hours.\n\nSo, 12 * T = 24.\n\nNow, solving for T, T = 24 / 12 = 2 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nIf 6 workers take 4 hours, and 12 is double the number of workers, then it should take half the time, which is 2 hours. Yeah, that seems logical.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can think in terms of work rates. If 6 workers take 4 hours, then each worker is contributing a certain amount of work per hour.\n\nThe work rate of one worker is the amount of work they can complete in one hour.\n\nLet's denote the work rate of one worker as R (fence per hour).\n\nThen, the combined work rate of 6 workers is 6R.\n\nSince they take 4 hours to build the fence, the total work is 6R * 4 = 24R, which should be equal to one fence.\n\nSo, 24R = 1 fence.\n\nTherefore, R = 1/24 fence per hour.\n\nNow, if we have 12 workers, their combined work rate is 12R = 12*(1/24) = 12/24 = 1/2 fence per hour.\n\nSo, if they can build half a fence per hour, then to build one fence, it would take 2 hours.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nIs there another perspective I can look at this from?\n\nPerhaps using proportions. Since the number of workers is inversely proportional to the time taken, we can set up a proportion:\n\n6 workers * 4 hours = 12 workers * T hours.\n\nSo, 24 = 12T.\n\nTherefore, T = 24 / 12 = 2 hours.\n\nOnce more, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should be considering. Is the work divisible infinitely? For example, can we really assume that doubling the number of workers halves the time perfectly, or is there a limit to how much adding more workers can speed up the process?\n\nIn real-life scenarios, there might be diminishing returns when adding more workers due to space constraints, coordination issues, etc. But since this is a math problem, I think it's safe to assume that such factors aren't in play here, and that the relationship is purely inverse proportional.\n\nAnother way to think about it is in terms of the total amount of work required to build the fence remains constant, regardless of how many workers are involved. It's just that more workers can share the workload, thereby reducing the time needed.\n\nSo, in this case, the total work is 24 worker-hours, and with 12 workers, it should take 2 hours.\n\nWait a minute, what if I consider the work in terms of man-hours? Is that the same as worker-hours? I think \"man-hours\" is a term used to denote the same concept.\n\nYes, man-hours refer to the total amount of time spent on a task by one person, regardless of how many people are involved. So, in this problem, the total man-hours required to build the fence are 24 man-hours.\n\nWith 12 workers, the time taken would be total man-hours divided by the number of workers, which is 24 / 12 = 2 hours.\n\nAll these different approaches are leading me to the same conclusion.\n\nIs there a formula I can use for this type of problem?\n\nYes, there is a general formula for inverse proportion problems.\n\nIf quantity Q1 is inversely proportional to quantity Q2, then Q1 * Q2 = k, where k is a constant.\n\nIn this case, the number of workers (W) is inversely proportional to the time taken (T), so W * T = k.\n\nGiven that 6 workers take 4 hours, k = 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nNow, for 12 workers, T = k / W = 24 / 12 = 2 hours.\n\nThis formula reinforces the earlier calculations.\n\nLet me see if I can generalize this for future problems.\n\nIf W1 workers take T1 time to complete a job, then for W2 workers, the time taken T2 is given by W1 * T1 = W2 * T2, assuming the total work remains the same.\n\nSo, T2 = (W1 * T1) / W2.\n\nPlugging in the values: T2 = (6 * 4) / 12 = 24 / 12 = 2 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this problem, I end up with 2 hours as the answer.\n\nIs there any chance that this could be wrong?\n\nWell, perhaps if the problem had additional constraints or if there was more to it, but as it's presented, it seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the units make sense.\n\nWorkers are measured in number of people, time in hours.\n\nWorker-hours would be (number of workers) * (hours), which is a measure of total work effort.\n\nSo, 6 workers * 4 hours = 24 worker-hours.\n\nThen, 12 workers * 2 hours = 24 worker-hours.\n\nThe total work effort is the same in both cases, which matches the total work required to build the fence.\n\nThis gives me confidence that the answer is indeed 2 hours.\n\nMoreover, I can think about it in terms of work done per hour.\n\nWith 6 workers, they complete 1 fence in 4 hours, so their combined work rate is 1 fence / 4 hours = 0.25 fences per hour.\n\nTherefore, the work rate per worker is 0.25 / 6 \u2248 0.0417 fences per hour.\n\nNow, with 12 workers, the combined work rate would be 12 * 0.0417 \u2248 0.5 fences per hour.\n\nTherefore, to build one fence, it would take 1 / 0.5 = 2 hours.\n\nThis yet another method leads to the same conclusion.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the answer is 2 hours.\n\nJust for completeness, what if the number of workers was different? Say, 3 workers. How long would it take them?\n\nUsing the same formula, T = (6 * 4) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8 hours.\n\nSimilarly, if there were 8 workers, T = 24 / 8 = 3 hours.\n\nThis shows that the relationship holds for other numbers of workers as well.\n\nIn summary, using multiple approaches\u2014worker-hours, work rates, proportions, and formulas\u2014I consistently arrive at the conclusion that it would take 12 workers 2 hours to build the same fence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
