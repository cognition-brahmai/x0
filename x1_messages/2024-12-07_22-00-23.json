        "content": "So I have this equation: 3x + 5 = 17. I need to solve for x, right? Okay, let's see how to do that step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to isolate x on one side of the equation. That means I need to get rid of the +5 and the 3 that are attached to x. Let me think about this.\n\nI remember that whatever I do to one side of the equation, I have to do to the other side to keep it balanced. So, if I subtract 5 from one side, I need to subtract 5 from the other side too.\n\nLet's do that:\n\n3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3x = 12\n\nOkay, now I have 3x = 12. I need to get x by itself. Since x is being multiplied by 3, I should divide both sides by 3 to solve for x.\n\nSo:\n\n3x / 3 = 12 / 3\n\nThat gives:\n\nx = 4\n\nWait, is that all? Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I had 3x + 5 = 17.\n\nI subtracted 5 from both sides:\n\n3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3x = 12\n\nThen, I divided both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 12 / 3\n\nSo, x = 4\n\nSeems straightforward. But let me double-check by plugging x back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 5 = 17\n\nPlug in x = 4:\n\n3*(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17\n\nYes, that matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 4 is correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. But maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let's see.\n\nAnother method could be to first divide both sides by 3, but that might make things more complicated because 5 divided by 3 isn't a whole number.\n\nLet's try it:\n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 5 = 17\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n(3x + 5)/3 = 17/3\n\nWhich is:\n\n3x/3 + 5/3 = 17/3\n\nSimplifies to:\n\nx + 5/3 = 17/3\n\nNow, subtract 5/3 from both sides:\n\nx + 5/3 - 5/3 = 17/3 - 5/3\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx = (17 - 5)/3\n\nx = 12/3\n\nx = 4\n\nAgain, I get x = 4. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI guess the first method is simpler because it involves smaller numbers and avoids dealing with fractions. But it's good to know that both approaches work.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider? Maybe checking if x = 4 makes sense in the context of the problem. But since this is just a straightforward algebraic equation without any real-world constraints, I think x = 4 is the solution.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
