        "content": "So, there's this situation where a group of friends had dinner together and now they need to split the bill evenly. The total bill is $150, and there are 5 people in the group. The question is, how much does each person owe?\n\nAlright, to figure this out, I think the simplest way is to divide the total bill by the number of people. So, that means $150 divided by 5 people.\n\nLet me write that down: $150 \u00f7 5.\n\nNow, dividing 150 by 5, let's see:\n\n5 times 30 is 150, right? So, each person owes $30.\n\nBut, to make sure, maybe I can check this another way. Perhaps using multiplication. If each person owes $30, and there are 5 people, then 30 multiplied by 5 should give us back the total bill.\n\nSo, $30 x 5 = $150. Yeah, that matches the total bill. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but what if one of the friends didn't eat as much or maybe didn't have as expensive a meal? Shouldn't we consider that? Well, the question says they decided to split the bill evenly. So, regardless of what each person ate, they agreed to share the cost equally.\n\nSo, even if one person had a more expensive dish, they're still paying the same amount as everyone else, according to their agreement.\n\nBut, just out of curiosity, how would it be different if they split the bill based on what each person ate?\n\nWell, in that case, we'd need to know the individual amounts each person's meal cost, and then sum them up to ensure it still totals $150, but that's not what's being asked here.\n\nThe question specifically says they're splitting the bill evenly, so it's straightforward division: total bill divided by the number of people.\n\nLet me consider if there's any tax or tip added to the bill that might affect the amount each person owes. The question doesn't mention any additional charges beyond the total bill of $150, so I'll assume that $150 is the final amount to be paid, including any taxes or tips.\n\nIf there were additional charges, we'd need to add those to the total before dividing by the number of people.\n\nBut again, according to the question, the total bill is $150, so we can proceed with that figure.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if any of the friends have any discounts or if there are separate bills for drinks or other items, but the question doesn't specify any of that. It seems like the total bill is inclusive of everything, and it's to be split evenly among the 5 friends.\n\nSo, sticking to the given information, each person owes $30.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider if there's a mathematical formula or another method to verify this.\n\nWell, in mathematics, dividing the total amount by the number of shares gives the amount per share. Here, the total amount is $150, and the number of shares is 5.\n\nSo, amount per person = total bill / number of people = $150 / 5 = $30.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it as distributing the total amount equally among the 5 people.\n\nStarting with $150, we can distribute $30 to each person:\n\nFirst person gets $30, total distributed: $30\n\nSecond person gets $30, total distributed: $60\n\nThird person gets $30, total distributed: $90\n\nFourth person gets $30, total distributed: $120\n\nFifth person gets $30, total distributed: $150\n\nWhich matches the total bill.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, each person owes $30.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The problem is straightforward once you understand that they're splitting the bill evenly, regardless of what each person ate.\n\nSometimes, in real life, splitting bills can get more complicated, especially if some people didn't have drinks or had cheaper meals, but in this case, it's clear that they agreed to split it evenly.\n\nSo, the answer is each person owes $30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
