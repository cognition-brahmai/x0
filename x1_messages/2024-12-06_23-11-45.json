        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field with a perimeter of 80 meters, and the length is twice the width. We need to find the area of the field.\n\nFirst, I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for the perimeter is:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nGiven that the perimeter \\( P \\) is 80 meters, we can write:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2w = 80 \\]\n\nAlso, it's stated that the length is twice the width, so:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nNow, I can substitute the expression for \\( l \\) into the perimeter equation:\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 80 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 80 \\]\n\\[ 6w = 80 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{80}{6} \\]\n\\[ w = \\frac{40}{3} \\approx 13.\\overline{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThen, since \\( l = 2w \\):\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.\\overline{6} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow, to find the area \\( A \\) of the rectangle, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ A = l \\times w \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{80}{3} \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{3200}{9} \\approx 355.\\overline{5} \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nBut wait, let's check if this makes sense. The perimeter is 80 meters, and the length is twice the width. Let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I know that for a rectangle, if you know the perimeter and the ratio of length to width, you can set up equations to solve for both dimensions.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w = 80 \\]\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nSo, plugging in \\( l = 2w \\) into the perimeter equation:\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 80 \\]\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 80 \\]\n\\[ 6w = 80 \\]\n\\[ w = \\frac{80}{6} = \\frac{40}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{80}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow, area:\n\n\\[ A = l \\times w = \\frac{80}{3} \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{3200}{9} \\approx 355.\\overline{5} \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for perimeter to express one variable in terms of the other and then substitute.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom \\( P = 2l + 2w = 80 \\), I can write:\n\n\\[ l + w = 40 \\]\n\nBecause dividing both sides by 2.\n\nNow, given \\( l = 2w \\), substitute into the equation:\n\n\\[ 2w + w = 40 \\]\n\\[ 3w = 40 \\]\n\\[ w = \\frac{40}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{80}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nAgain, the same values.\n\nNow, to find the area:\n\n\\[ A = l \\times w = \\frac{80}{3} \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{3200}{9} \\]\n\nWhich is approximately 355.555... square meters.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nSo, the exact area is \\( \\frac{3200}{9} \\) square meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me consider another method.\n\nLet me denote the width as \\( w \\) and the length as \\( l = 2w \\).\n\nPerimeter is:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2w = 80 \\]\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 80 \\]\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 80 \\]\n\\[ 6w = 80 \\]\n\\[ w = \\frac{80}{6} = \\frac{40}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ l = 2w = \\frac{80}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nArea:\n\n\\[ A = l \\times w = \\frac{80}{3} \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{3200}{9} \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nThis consistent result suggests that my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of the perimeter and the relationship between length and width.\n\nBut I think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the area of the field is \\( \\frac{3200}{9} \\) square meters, which is approximately 355.56 square meters.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify to use an approximation, perhaps I should present the exact fractional value.\n\nTherefore, the area is \\( \\frac{3200}{9} \\) square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3200}{9}} \\]"
