It was indeed somewhat pejorative, implying that such a person was self-centered and lacked the public spirit valued in democratic societies.\n\nIn Athenian democracy, active participation in the assembly and other civic duties was highly valued. Citizens who did not participate were sometimes looked down upon, and the term \"idiotes\" was used to label them. So, in that context, it was an insult to be called an \"idiotes.\""
