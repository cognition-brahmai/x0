It's generally recommended that people with heart disease limit their intake of saturated and trans fats because these types of fats can raise cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart problems. Instead, opting for healthier fats like those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil might be better. However, everyone's situation is different, so it's important to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian for personalized advice."
