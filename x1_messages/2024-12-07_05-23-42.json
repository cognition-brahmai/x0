        "content": "Hmm, that's an interesting question. Let's see. I know that most months have either 31 or 30 days, but February is the exception because it has 28 days in a common year and 29 in a leap year. So, how many months have 28 days? Well, thinking about it, February has at least 28 days, and the other months have more than that. So, is it just February? Or is there something else I'm missing here?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. All months have at least 28 days because even the shortest month, February, has 28 days in a common year and 29 in a leap year. So, does that mean all 12 months have at least 28 days? Let me check. January has 31, February has 28 or 29, March has 31, April has 30, May has 31, June has 30, July has 31, August has 31, September has 30, October has 31, November has 30, and December has 31. So, every single month has at least 28 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that all 12 months have 28 days. But that seems too straightforward. Is there a trick to this question? Maybe it's a trick question, and the answer is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is worded to be tricky. It says, \"How many have 28 days?\" Not \"How many have exactly 28 days?\" or \"How many have at least 28 days?\" Just \"have 28 days.\" So, if a month has more than 28 days, does that mean it doesn't have 28 days? Wait, that doesn't make sense because, for example, January has 31 days, which includes 28 days plus 3 more. So, in a way, all months have 28 days plus some extra days.\n\nBut that might be stretching it. Maybe the correct interpretation is that only February has exactly 28 days in a common year. So, in that case, only one month has exactly 28 days. But then, in a leap year, February has 29 days, so only in common years is February the only month with exactly 28 days.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at the question again. \"Some months have 31 days, others have 30 days. How many have 28 days?\" So, it's comparing months with 31 days and those with 30, and asking about those with 28.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that February has 28 days in common years and 29 in leap years, perhaps the answer is that only one month has 28 days, which is February in common years.\n\nBut then again, in leap years, February has 29 days, so it doesn't have exactly 28 days in those years. So, perhaps the answer is that no month has exactly 28 days, because in leap years, February has 29, and in common years, only February has 28, but other months have more.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify leap years or common years. It just says \"how many have 28 days?\" So, perhaps it's considering the general case where February has 28 days in some years, and 29 in others.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should simplify it. If I consider that February is the only month that can have exactly 28 days in some years, then perhaps the answer is one month has 28 days.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that all months have at least 28 days, then the answer would be all 12 months.\n\nBut I think the intended answer is probably that only one month has exactly 28 days in common years, which is February.\n\nSo, I'll go with that. The answer is one month has 28 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
