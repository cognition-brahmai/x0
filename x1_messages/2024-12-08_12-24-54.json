        "content": "Let's figure this out step by step. John starts by eating 2 apples on Monday. Then, each day after that, he doubles the amount he ate the previous day. So, I need to find out how many apples he eats on Thursday.\n\nFirst, let's list out the days from Monday to Thursday:\n\n- Monday\n\n- Tuesday\n\n- Wednesday\n\n- Thursday\n\nJohn eats 2 apples on Monday. On Tuesday, he doubles that amount. So, on Tuesday, he eats 2 times 2, which is 4 apples.\n\nNext, on Wednesday, he doubles the amount he ate on Tuesday. So, 4 times 2 equals 8 apples.\n\nFinally, on Thursday, he doubles the amount from Wednesday. So, 8 times 2 equals 16 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Starting with 2 apples on Monday:\n\n- Monday: 2 apples\n\n- Tuesday: 2 * 2 = 4 apples\n\n- Wednesday: 4 * 2 = 8 apples\n\n- Thursday: 8 * 2 = 16 apples\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, John eats 16 apples on Thursday.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Since he doubles the amount each day, the number of apples he eats each day forms a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous one.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, the nth term can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = a_1 * r^(n-1)\n\nwhere:\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the term number\n\nIn this case:\n\n- a_1 = 2 (apples on Monday)\n\n- r = 2 (doubling each day)\n\n- n = 4 (since Thursday is the fourth day starting from Monday)\n\nSo, a_4 = 2 * 2^(4-1) = 2 * 2^3 = 2 * 8 = 16 apples\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of exponents. Starting with 2 apples on Monday, each day he multiplies the previous day's amount by 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- Monday: 2 = 2^1\n\n- Tuesday: 2^2 = 4\n\n- Wednesday: 2^3 = 8\n\n- Thursday: 2^4 = 16\n\nWait, but on Monday he eats 2 apples, which is 2^1, and then each day he doubles, which is equivalent to increasing the exponent by 1 each day.\n\nSo, on the nth day, he eats 2^n apples.\n\nBut if Monday is day 1, then:\n\n- Monday (day 1): 2^1 = 2\n\n- Tuesday (day 2): 2^2 = 4\n\n- Wednesday (day 3): 2^3 = 8\n\n- Thursday (day 4): 2^4 = 16\n\nAgain, this confirms that on Thursday, he eats 16 apples.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The problem says he doubles the amount he eats each day \"thereafter.\" So, starting from Monday, each subsequent day he doubles the previous day's amount.\n\nSo, Monday: 2 apples\n\nTuesday: 2 * 2 = 4 apples\n\nWednesday: 4 * 2 = 8 apples\n\nThursday: 8 * 2 = 16 apples\n\nNo other interpretation seems logical here.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of total apples eaten up to Thursday, that would be the sum of the apples eaten each day from Monday to Thursday.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the number of apples he eats on Thursday alone, not the total up to Thursday. So, I don't need to calculate the sum of the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 16 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
