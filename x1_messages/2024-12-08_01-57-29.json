        "content": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and tiny particles. Blue light has shorter wavelengths and higher energy compared to other colors in the visible spectrum. These shorter wavelengths are scattered more effectively by the molecules in the atmosphere, spreading them in all directions. As a result, when we look up at the sky, we see this scattered blue light. This is why the sky appears blue on a clear day.\n"
