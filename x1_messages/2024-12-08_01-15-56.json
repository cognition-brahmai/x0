        "content": "So the car rental company has a flat fee of $20 for renting a car, and then they charge an additional $0.10 for every mile you drive. The customer in this case drove 150 miles. I need to find out the total cost for this rental.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the flat fee is. The flat fee is a fixed amount that doesn't change regardless of how many miles you drive. So, that's $20.\n\nNext, there's a charge per mile. It's $0.10 per mile. The customer drove 150 miles, so I need to multiply the number of miles by the charge per mile.\n\nSo, $0.10 times 150 miles should give me the cost for the miles driven.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.10 times 150 is 15. So, the cost for the miles driven is $15.\n\nNow, to get the total cost, I need to add the flat fee and the cost for the miles driven.\n\nFlat fee: $20\n\nCost for miles: $15\n\nTotal cost: $20 + $15 = $35\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, flat fee is $20.\n\nThen, $0.10 per mile for 150 miles: 0.10 * 150 = 15.\n\nAdding them up: 20 + 15 = 35.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in a formula. Total cost = flat fee + (charge per mile * number of miles).\n\nSo, Total cost = 20 + (0.10 * 150) = 20 + 15 = 35.\n\nI think that's the total cost.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other charges that might apply. Is there any tax or additional fees that the company might charge? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so I'll assume that the only charges are the flat fee and the per mile charge.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The charge is per mile, and the distance driven is in miles, so that's consistent.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the mile charge is per mile or per kilometer, but since the problem specifies miles, I don't need to convert units.\n\nAlright, I think $35 is the correct total cost for the car rental.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
