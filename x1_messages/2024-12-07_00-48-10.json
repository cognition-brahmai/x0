        "content": "So the water tank can hold up to 500 gallons, right? And it's currently filled to 80% of its capacity. I need to find out how many more gallons are needed to fill it completely.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much water is already in the tank. Since it's filled to 80% of 500 gallons, I can calculate that by multiplying 500 by 0.80.\n\nSo, 500 gallons times 0.80 equals 400 gallons. That means there are already 400 gallons in the tank.\n\nNow, to find out how many more gallons are needed to fill it up to the full capacity, I need to subtract the current amount from the total capacity.\n\nSo, 500 gallons minus 400 gallons equals 100 gallons.\n\nTherefore, 100 more gallons of water are needed to fill the tank completely.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by calculating what 20% of the capacity is, since 100% minus 80% is 20%.\n\nSo, 20% of 500 gallons would be 500 times 0.20, which is also 100 gallons.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 100 gallons.\n\nIt's always good to double-check with different approaches to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
