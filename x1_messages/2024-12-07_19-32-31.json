        "content": "So, the farmer has 12 cows, and each cow produces 15 liters of milk per day. We need to find out how much milk the farmer will have after one week.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much milk all the cows produce in one day. Since each cow produces 15 liters per day, and there are 12 cows, we can multiply the number of cows by the milk production per cow per day:\n\n12 cows * 15 liters/cow/day = 180 liters/day\n\nSo, the farmer gets 180 liters of milk each day.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much milk is produced in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we can multiply the daily milk production by 7:\n\n180 liters/day * 7 days = 1260 liters\n\nTherefore, after one week, the farmer will have 1260 liters of milk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1260} \\]"
