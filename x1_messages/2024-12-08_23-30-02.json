        "content": "The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for perimeter is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nGiven that the length (L) is 30 feet and the width (W) is 20 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2(30) + 2(20)\n\nFirst, multiply 2 by 30:\n\n2 * 30 = 60 feet\n\nThen, multiply 2 by 20:\n\n2 * 20 = 40 feet\n\nNow, add these two results together:\n\n60 feet + 40 feet = 100 feet\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the garden is 100 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
