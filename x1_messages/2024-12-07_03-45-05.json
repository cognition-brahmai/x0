        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out the daily profit from both products and then multiply that by the number of days in a week to get the weekly profit.\n\nSo, the factory produces 1,200 units of product A each day, and each unit of product A brings in a profit of $5. Therefore, the daily profit from product A is:\n\n1,200 units * $5/unit = $6,000\n\nSimilarly, the factory produces 800 units of product B each day, with each unit bringing in a profit of $8. So, the daily profit from product B is:\n\n800 units * $8/unit = $6,400\n\nNow, to find the total daily profit from both products, we add the profits together:\n\n$6,000 (from A) + $6,400 (from B) = $12,400 per day\n\nSince we want to find the profit for one week, which is 7 days, we multiply the daily profit by 7:\n\n$12,400/day * 7 days = $86,800\n\nTherefore, the total profit the factory makes in one week is $86,800.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check our calculations.\n\nFirst, daily profit from product A:\n\n1,200 units * $5/unit = $6,000 \u2014 that seems correct.\n\nDaily profit from product B:\n\n800 units * $8/unit = $6,400 \u2014 that also seems correct.\n\nTotal daily profit:\n\n$6,000 + $6,400 = $12,400 \u2014 yes, that's right.\n\nNow, weekly profit:\n\n$12,400/day * 7 days = $86,800 \u2014 no issues there.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the total units produced in a week for each product and then compute the profit.\n\nFor product A:\n\n1,200 units/day * 7 days = 8,400 units/week\n\nProfit from product A in a week:\n\n8,400 units * $5/unit = $42,000\n\nFor product B:\n\n800 units/day * 7 days = 5,600 units/week\n\nProfit from product B in a week:\n\n5,600 units * $8/unit = $44,800\n\nTotal weekly profit:\n\n$42,000 (from A) + $44,800 (from B) = $86,800\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation, so we can be confident that $86,800 is the correct total profit for one week.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the combined profit per unit for both products and then multiply by the total units produced per day, but that might be more complicated. The method we used is straightforward and less prone to error.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if the factory were to increase production or change the profit per unit, we would need to adjust our calculations accordingly. But based on the given data, $86,800 is the correct weekly profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{86800} \\]"
