        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the company has a budget of $10,000 for employee bonuses, and they need to give each employee an equal bonus. But before they can distribute the bonuses, they have to deduct a 5% administrative fee from the budget. There are 20 employees in total. I need to find out how much each employee will receive.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the administrative fee. It's 5% of the $10,000 budget. To find 5% of $10,000, I can multiply 10,000 by 0.05 (since 5% equals 0.05 in decimal form).\n\nAdministrative fee = 10,000 * 0.05 = $500\n\nNow, I need to subtract this administrative fee from the total budget to find out how much is left for the bonuses.\n\nRemaining budget for bonuses = 10,000 - 500 = $9,500\n\nNext, I need to divide this remaining amount equally among the 20 employees.\n\nBonus per employee = 9,500 / 20\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n9,500 divided by 20 is 475.\n\nSo, each employee will receive $475.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the administrative fee is indeed 5% of $10,000, which is $500.\n\nThen, subtracting that from the total budget gives $9,500.\n\nDividing $9,500 by 20 employees should give each employee $475.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in another way to confirm.\n\nIf the total budget is $10,000 and they need to deduct 5% for administration, that means 95% of the budget is left for bonuses.\n\nSo, 95% of $10,000 is 10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.\n\nThen, dividing $9,500 by 20 employees still gives $475 per employee.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other fee or complication, but according to the problem, the only deduction is the 5% administrative fee, and then the remaining amount is divided equally among the employees.\n\nSo, I think $475 is the correct amount each employee will receive.\n\nI can also check if there's a possibility of rounding or any other considerations, but since we're dealing with dollars and the numbers are straightforward, there shouldn't be any issues.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that each employee will receive a bonus of $475.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{475} \\]"
