        "content": "Alright, let's solve the equation 5x - 7 = 18 step by step. So, the equation is:\n\n5x - 7 = 18\n\nOur goal is to find the value of x. To do that, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We'll do this by performing operations that balance both sides of the equation.\n\nFirst, let's deal with the -7 on the left side. To cancel out the -7, we'll add 7 to both sides of the equation. This way, the -7 and +7 will cancel each other out on the left side.\n\nSo, adding 7 to both sides:\n\n5x - 7 + 7 = 18 + 7\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n5x = 25\n\nNow, we have 5x = 25. To solve for x, we need to get rid of the coefficient 5 that's multiplying x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 5:\n\n5x / 5 = 25 / 5\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nx = 5\n\nThere we go! The solution to the equation 5x - 7 = 18 is x = 5.\n\nTo make sure our answer is correct, let's plug x = 5 back into the original equation and see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n5x - 7 = 18\n\nSubstituting x = 5:\n\n5*(5) - 7 = 18\n\nCalculate:\n\n25 - 7 = 18\n\n18 = 18\n\nYes! Both sides are equal, which confirms that our solution is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is x = 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
