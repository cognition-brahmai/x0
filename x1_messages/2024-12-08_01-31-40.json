        "content": "So in this class, there are 40 students in total, and out of those, 16 are boys. The rest are girls. So, first, I need to find out how many girls there are.\n\nTo do that, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\nGirls = Total students - Boys\n\nGirls = 40 - 16 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 girls in the class.\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of boys to girls. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, the ratio of boys to girls is:\n\nBoys : Girls = 16 : 24\n\nTo simplify this ratio, I can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 16 and 24 is 8.\n\nSo, dividing both numbers by 8:\n\n16 \u00f7 8 = 2\n\n24 \u00f7 8 = 3\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio of boys to girls is 2:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2:3} \\]"
