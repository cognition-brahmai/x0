        "content": "So I've got this problem here about an elevator and how many people can use it without exceeding its maximum capacity. Let's see:\n\nThe elevator can carry a maximum of 800 kilograms. There's a group of people, and on average, each person weighs 75 kilograms. I need to figure out how many people can use the elevator at once without exceeding that 800 kg limit.\n\nOkay, so this seems like a division problem. I think I should divide the maximum capacity of the elevator by the average weight of each person. That should give me the maximum number of people.\n\nSo, 800 kg divided by 75 kg per person. Let's do that division:\n\n800 \u00f7 75.\n\nHmm, 75 times 10 is 750, which is less than 800. Subtract 750 from 800, and I get 50. So, 10 people plus some fraction.\n\nNow, 75 times 10 is 750, and 75 times 11 is 825, which is more than 800. So, 11 people would exceed the limit because 11 times 75 is 825 kg, which is over 800 kg.\n\nBut with 10 people, it's 750 kg, which is under the limit. So, maybe the answer is 10 people.\n\nWait, but there's 50 kg left (800 - 750 = 50). Could there be an 11th person who weighs less than 50 kg? The problem says the average weight is 75 kg, but it doesn't specify that every person weighs exactly 75 kg. Maybe some people weigh less, and some weigh more.\n\nBut since it's an average, there could be people lighter and heavier than 75 kg. If there's an 11th person who weighs less than 50 kg, then adding them wouldn't exceed the limit.\n\nHowever, we don't have information about the distribution of weights, so we can't assume that. To be safe, we should assume that each additional person could weigh up to 75 kg.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the maximum number of people whose total weight doesn't exceed 800 kg, given that each person weighs on average 75 kg.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's use the formula:\n\nNumber of people = floor(800 / 75)\n\nWhere floor means rounding down to the nearest whole number because you can't have a fraction of a person.\n\nSo, 800 divided by 75 is 10.666...\n\nRounding down, that's 10 people.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, that would be 750 kg, and there's 50 kg left. But since we don't know the weight of the 11th person, it's safer to stick with 10 people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator could allow 10 full-weight people and possibly one lighter person with the remaining capacity.\n\nBut again, without knowing the distribution, it's better to be cautious.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the maximum possible weight for 11 people and see if it could be within 800 kg.\n\nIf the average weight is 75 kg, then for 11 people, the total weight would be 11 * 75 = 825 kg, which is over 800 kg.\n\nSo, in that case, even if some people weigh less, others could weigh more, potentially still exceeding the limit.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that the total weight doesn't exceed 800 kg, it's safer to limit the number to 10 people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator has some buffer or safety margin, but the problem specifies the maximum weight capacity, so I should adhere to that.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate how many people can be accommodated within 800 kg, given that each person weighs 75 kg on average.\n\nSo, Total weight capacity / average weight per person = number of people.\n\n800 / 75 = 10.666...\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to 10.\n\nBut, perhaps I can consider if there's a way to maximize the number of people without exceeding the limit, considering that not all people might weigh exactly 75 kg.\n\nHowever, in the absence of specific information about individual weights, the safest approach is to use the average weight and round down.\n\nSo, my final answer is 10 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
