        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The factory initially produces 200 widgets per day. They decide to increase production by 50% due to increased demand.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate what 50% of 200 is. 50% of 200 is calculated as:\n\n0.50 \u00d7 200 = 100\n\nSo, they increase production by 100 widgets per day. Therefore, the new production rate is:\n\n200 + 100 = 300 widgets per day\n\nThey produce at this new rate for a week, but then they realize they need to decrease production by 20% to maintain quality control.\n\nNow, I need to calculate 20% of 300.\n\n0.20 \u00d7 300 = 60\n\nSo, they need to decrease production by 60 widgets per day. Therefore, the final production rate is:\n\n300 - 60 = 240 widgets per day\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. They increased production by 50%, which got them to 300 widgets per day, and then decreased by 20% of that new amount, which is 60 widgets, resulting in 240 widgets per day.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that percentage changes can be a bit tricky because percentages are based on the initial value. But in this case, the 20% decrease is based on the new production rate after the 50% increase, not the original rate.\n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. The overall change can be calculated by multiplying the percentage factors.\n\nFirst, a 50% increase is the same as multiplying by 1 + 0.50 = 1.50\n\nThen, a 20% decrease is the same as multiplying by 1 - 0.20 = 0.80\n\nSo, the overall multiplication factor is:\n\n1.50 \u00d7 0.80 = 1.20\n\nTherefore, the final production rate is:\n\n200 \u00d7 1.20 = 240 widgets per day\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, the factory will produce 240 widgets per day after these changes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the 20% decrease was applied to the original production rate instead of the new one. That would be:\n\n20% of 200 is 40 widgets.\n\nSo, decreasing the original 200 by 40 would give 160, and then increasing by 50% would be:\n\n160 + 80 = 240 again.\n\nWait, that's the same number. Is that a coincidence?\n\nNo, actually, the order of operations matters here. If the decrease was applied to the original amount before the increase, it would be different.\n\nLet me clarify: the problem says they first increase production by 50% and then decrease production by 20% after a week.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to apply the 50% increase first, then the 20% decrease on the new amount, which is what I did initially.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 240 widgets per day after these changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
