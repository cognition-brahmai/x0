        "content": "Let's see. So, the store is offering a 20% discount if you buy 5 or more items. I need to find out how much it would cost to buy 7 items, and each item normally costs $25.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what the total cost would be without any discount. Since each item is $25 and I'm buying 7, I can multiply 25 by 7.\n\n25 times 7 is... let's see, 25 times 5 is 125, and 25 times 2 is 50, so total would be 125 plus 50, which is 175. So, without any discount, it would cost $175.\n\nBut, since I'm buying 7 items, which is more than 5, I get a 20% discount. So, I need to calculate what 20% of $175 is and then subtract that from $175.\n\nFirst, finding 20% of 175. 20% is the same as 20 divided by 100, which is 0.2. So, 0.2 times 175.\n\n0.2 times 175 is... 0.2 times 100 is 20, and 0.2 times 75 is 15, so total discount is 20 plus 15, which is $35.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the original total: $175 minus $35 is $140.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nOriginal price per item: $25\n\nNumber of items: 7\n\nTotal without discount: 25 * 7 = $175\n\nDiscount: 20% of $175\n\nTo find 20% of $175: 0.2 * 175 = $35\n\nSo, discount is $35\n\nTotal cost after discount: $175 - $35 = $140\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the discounted price by multiplying the original price by (100% - discount percentage). So, in this case, it would be 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, 80% of $175 should also give me the final price.\n\n80% of 175 is 0.8 * 175.\n\n0.8 times 175 is... 0.8 times 100 is 80, and 0.8 times 75 is 60, so 80 plus 60 is $140.\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the price per item after discount and then multiply by the number of items.\n\nFirst, find the discounted price per item.\n\nOriginal price per item: $25\n\nDiscount: 20% of $25\n\n20% of 25 is 0.2 * 25 = $5\n\nSo, discount per item is $5\n\nTherefore, discounted price per item is $25 - $5 = $20\n\nNow, for 7 items: $20 * 7 = $140\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, the total cost comes out to be $140.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
