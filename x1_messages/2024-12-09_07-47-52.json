        "content": "Okay, so I've got this task to classify these national parks based on their primary ecosystems. The parks are Yellowstone, Everglades, Grand Canyon, and Great Barrier Reef. I need to figure out what kind of ecosystems are main in each of these places.\n\nFirst up, Yellowstone National Park. I know Yellowstone is in the United States, mostly in Wyoming. I remember it's famous for its geysers, like Old Faithful, and also for its wildlife, like bears and wolves. So, in terms of ecosystem, it seems like it's a mix of things, but maybe the primary ecosystem is a temperate forest or something like that. I think Yellowstone is in a volcanic area, which might affect its ecosystem too. Maybe it's a volcanic plateau with forest and grasslands.\n\nNext, Everglades National Park, also in the U.S., in Florida. The Everglades is known for its wetlands, right? It's a huge marshy area, with lots of water, sawgrass, and all sorts of aquatic life, including alligators and mangroves. So, its primary ecosystem is probably a tropical wetland or swamp.\n\nGrand Canyon National Park, Arizona, U.S. This is famous for its immense canyon carved by the Colorado River. The landscape is arid, with desert vegetation and exposed rock layers. So, I would say its primary ecosystem is a desert, maybe a canyon desert ecosystem.\n\nLastly, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, off the coast of Australia. This is a massive coral reef system, home to a vast array of marine life. Clearly, its primary ecosystem is a coral reef, which is an oceanic ecosystem.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Yellowstone: Volcanic plateau with forest and grasslands.\n\n- Everglades: Tropical wetland or swamp.\n\n- Grand Canyon: Desert ecosystem.\n\n- Great Barrier Reef: Coral reef marine ecosystem.\n\nI think that makes sense based on what I know about these places."
