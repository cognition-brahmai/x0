        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. I need to find the probability that both balls picked randomly without replacement are red.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability means. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event is picking two red balls in a row without replacing the first one.\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 8 balls in total, so the probability is 5/8.\n\nStep 2: Given that the first ball picked was red, find the probability of picking another red ball.\n\nSince we're not replacing the first ball, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 7 balls remaining in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball on the second draw, given that the first was red, is 4/7.\n\nStep 3: To find the overall probability of both events happening (both balls being red), I need to multiply the probabilities from Step 1 and Step 2.\n\nSo, overall probability = (5/8) * (4/7).\n\nNow, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, multiply the numerators: 5 * 4 = 20.\n\nThen, multiply the denominators: 8 * 7 = 56.\n\nSo, the probability is 20/56.\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4.\n\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\n56 \u00f7 4 = 14\n\nSo, the simplified probability is 5/14.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5,2), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls out of 8 is C(8,2).\n\nSo, probability = C(5,2) / C(8,2).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nC(5,2) = 10\n\nC(8,2) = 28\n\nSo, probability = 10/28 = 5/14.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability of picking two red balls without replacement.\n\nThe probability of the first ball being red is 5/8.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of the second being red is 4/7.\n\nMultiplying them gives (5/8)*(4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is 5/14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{14}} \\]"
