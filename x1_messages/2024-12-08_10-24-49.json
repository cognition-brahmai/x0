Standard cabins can accommodate 2 passengers, deluxe cabins can hold 3 passengers, and suites can house 4 passengers. The company wants to maximize revenue by optimizing the number of each type of cabin while maintaining a 1:2:1 ratio between standard, deluxe, and suite cabins. Calculate the optimal number of each cabin type and the total revenue generated per cruise, assuming that standard cabins cost $1000 per person, deluxe cabins cost $1500 per person, and suites cost $2000 per person."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a cruise ship that can carry up to 3000 passengers, and there are three types of cabins: standard, deluxe, and suites. Each standard cabin holds 2 passengers, deluxe holds 3, and suites hold 4. The company wants to maintain a ratio of 1:2:1 for standard, deluxe, and suites respectively. Also, they want to maximize revenue based on the cost per person in each cabin type: $1000 for standard, $1500 for deluxe, and $2000 for suites.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ratio part. The ratio is 1:2:1 for standard:deluxe:suites. That means for every 1 standard cabin, there are 2 deluxe cabins and 1 suite cabin. Let's denote the number of standard cabins as S, deluxe as D, and suites as SU. According to the ratio:\n\nS : D : SU = 1 : 2 : 1\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\nD = 2S\n\nSU = S\n\nNow, each cabin type holds a different number of passengers:\n\n- Standard: 2 passengers per cabin\n\n- Deluxe: 3 passengers per cabin\n\n- Suites: 4 passengers per cabin\n\nSo, the total passenger capacity provided by all cabins should be equal to or less than 3000.\n\nTotal passengers = (S * 2) + (D * 3) + (SU * 4)\n\nBut since D = 2S and SU = S, we can substitute:\n\nTotal passengers = (S * 2) + (2S * 3) + (S * 4) = 2S + 6S + 4S = 12S\n\nThis total should be less than or equal to 3000:\n\n12S \u2264 3000\n\nSo, S \u2264 3000 / 12\n\nS \u2264 250\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of standard cabins we can have is 250. Given the ratio, deluxe cabins would be 2 * 250 = 500, and suites would be 250.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue. Revenue is based on the cost per person, and each cabin type has a different rate:\n\n- Standard: $1000 per person\n\n- Deluxe: $1500 per person\n\n- Suites: $2000 per person\n\nSo, total revenue (R) would be:\n\nR = (number of standard passengers * $1000) + (number of deluxe passengers * $1500) + (number of suite passengers * $2000)\n\nNumber of passengers per cabin type:\n\n- Standard passengers = S * 2 = 250 * 2 = 500\n\n- Deluxe passengers = D * 3 = 500 * 3 = 1500\n\n- Suite passengers = SU * 4 = 250 * 4 = 1000\n\nWait a minute, let's check the total passengers:\n\n500 (standard) + 1500 (deluxe) + 1000 (suites) = 3000 passengers, which matches the ship's capacity.\n\nNow, calculate the revenue:\n\nR = (500 * 1000) + (1500 * 1500) + (1000 * 2000)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n- 500 * 1000 = 500,000\n\n- 1500 * 1500 = 2,250,000\n\n- 1000 * 2000 = 2,000,000\n\nTotal revenue R = 500,000 + 2,250,000 + 2,000,000 = 4,750,000\n\nSo, the total revenue per cruise would be $4,750,000.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to maximize this revenue further while still maintaining the ratio? Let's think about it.\n\nGiven that the ratio is fixed at 1:2:1, and the passenger capacity is fully utilized at 3000 passengers, it seems that this is the optimal distribution based on the given constraints.\n\nHowever, to double-check, let's consider if reducing the number of standard cabins and increasing the number of higher-paying suite cabins could increase revenue, but while maintaining the ratio.\n\nBut the ratio must be maintained at 1:2:1. So, for every standard cabin, there must be two deluxe and one suite. Therefore, we cannot independently increase the number of suites without adjusting the number of standard and deluxe cabins accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the initial calculation seems correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nNumber of standard cabins: 250\n\nNumber of deluxe cabins: 500\n\nNumber of suite cabins: 250\n\nTotal revenue per cruise: $4,750,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{250 \\text{ standard cabins},\\ 500 \\text{ deluxe cabins},\\ 250 \\text{ suites},\\ \\$4,750,000 \\text{ total revenue}}\\]"
