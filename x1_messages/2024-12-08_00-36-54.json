Externalities can be either positive or negative. Negative externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good or service imposes a cost on a third party not accounted for in the market price. For example, pollution from a factory affects the health of nearby residents but the factory doesn't bear the cost of the health impacts. Positive externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good or service provides a benefit to a third party that is not reflected in the market price. An example is education, which not only benefits the individual but also society through higher productivity and civic engagement. Government policies often aim to correct for these externalities through measures like taxes, subsidies, or regulations to align private costs and benefits with social costs and benefits."
