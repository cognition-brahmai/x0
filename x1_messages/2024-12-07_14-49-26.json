        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students, and 60% of them are boys. I need to find out how many girls are in the class. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many boys there are. Since 60% of the class are boys, I can calculate the number of boys by taking 60% of 30.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 30, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply by the total number of students.\n\n60% as a decimal is 0.60.\n\nSo, number of boys = 0.60 \u00d7 30.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 0.60 \u00d7 30 = 18.\n\nSo, there are 18 boys in the class.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.\n\nNumber of girls = total students - number of boys = 30 - 18 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 girls in the class.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of girls directly.\n\nIf 60% are boys, then the remaining percentage must be girls.\n\nSo, percentage of girls = 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nThen, number of girls = 40% of 30.\n\nAgain, converting 40% to a decimal: 0.40.\n\nNumber of girls = 0.40 \u00d7 30 = 12.\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could use fractions.\n\n60% is the same as 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nSo, the number of boys is 3/5 of 30.\n\n3/5 \u00d7 30 = (3 \u00d7 30)/5 = 90/5 = 18.\n\nAgain, confirming that there are 18 boys.\n\nThen, number of girls = 30 - 18 = 12.\n\nOr, for the girls, 40% is 40/100, which is 2/5.\n\n2/5 \u00d7 30 = (2 \u00d7 30)/5 = 60/5 = 12.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which method I use, I end up with 12 girls in the class.\n\nMaybe I can check this with another approach.\n\nLet's think about ratios.\n\nIf 60% are boys, then the ratio of boys to total students is 60:100, which simplifies to 3:5.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of girls to total students is 40:100, which simplifies to 2:5.\n\nSo, for every 5 students, 3 are boys and 2 are girls.\n\nGiven that there are 30 students in total, I can divide 30 by 5 to find out how many groups of 5 there are.\n\n30 \u00f7 5 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 groups of 5 students.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys = 3 boys/group \u00d7 6 groups = 18 boys.\n\nNumber of girls = 2 girls/group \u00d7 6 groups = 12 girls.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions.\n\nIf 60% are boys, then the proportion of boys is 0.60.\n\nSo, number of boys = 0.60 \u00d7 30 = 18.\n\nNumber of girls = 30 - 18 = 12.\n\nOr, proportion of girls = 0.40.\n\nNumber of girls = 0.40 \u00d7 30 = 12.\n\nAll these different methods lead me to the same conclusion that there are 12 girls in the class.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways.\n\nSo, the answer is 12 girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
