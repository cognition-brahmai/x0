        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets each day. On Monday, 10% of them are defective, and on Tuesday, 5% are defective. I need to find out the overall percentage of defective widgets over these two days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many defective widgets there are each day.\n\nOn Monday:\n\n10% of 1000 widgets are defective.\n\nSo, defective widgets on Monday = 10% of 1000 = 0.10 * 1000 = 100 widgets.\n\nOn Tuesday:\n\n5% of 1000 widgets are defective.\n\nSo, defective widgets on Tuesday = 5% of 1000 = 0.05 * 1000 = 50 widgets.\n\nNow, over two days, the total number of widgets produced is:\n\n1000 widgets/day * 2 days = 2000 widgets.\n\nThe total number of defective widgets over two days is:\n\n100 (Monday) + 50 (Tuesday) = 150 defective widgets.\n\nTo find the percentage of defective widgets over these two days, I need to divide the total defective widgets by the total widgets produced, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, percentage of defective widgets = (total defective widgets / total widgets produced) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage = (150 / 2000) * 100\n\nFirst, divide 150 by 2000:\n\n150 \u00f7 2000 = 0.075\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.075 * 100 = 7.5%\n\nSo, the percentage of defective widgets produced over Monday and Tuesday is 7.5%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the average percentage over the two days.\n\nOn Monday, 10% defective.\n\nOn Tuesday, 5% defective.\n\nAverage percentage = (10% + 5%) / 2 = 15% / 2 = 7.5%\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of widgets produced each day is the same (1000 per day), I can simply take the average of the two percentages.\n\nBut if the production quantities varied between days, I would need to weight the percentages according to the number of widgets produced each day.\n\nIn this case, since production is the same each day, the average percentage is fine.\n\nSo, yes, 7.5% is the correct overall percentage of defective widgets over the two days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5\\%} \\]"
