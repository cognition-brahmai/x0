        "content": "Let's see. I have a box with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, so total balls are 5 plus 7, which is 12 balls. I need to pick two balls without replacement, and I want to find the probability that I pick one ball of each color. That means one red and one blue.\n\nFirst, I should think about how many ways I can pick two balls from the box. Since the order doesn't matter, it's a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 12 is \"12 choose 2.\" I remember that the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, there are 66 possible ways to pick 2 balls from 12.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to pick one red and one blue ball. There are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red ball is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one blue ball is C(7, 1) = 7.\n\nSo, the number of ways to pick one red and one blue is 5 \u00d7 7 = 35.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 35 / 66.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using probabilities directly without combinations.\n\nLet's see: the probability of picking a red ball first is 5/12, and then picking a blue ball is 7/11, since one red ball is already picked and there are 11 balls left.\n\nSo, the probability of red then blue is (5/12) \u00d7 (7/11) = 35/132.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball first is 7/12, and then picking a red ball is 5/11.\n\nSo, the probability of blue then red is (7/12) \u00d7 (5/11) = 35/132.\n\nSince these are two distinct sequences that both result in one red and one blue ball, I need to add these probabilities together.\n\nSo, total probability = 35/132 + 35/132 = 70/132.\n\nSimplifying 70/132, dividing numerator and denominator by 2, we get 35/66.\n\nWait, that's the same answer I got using combinations: 35/66.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I think about the total number of ways to pick one red and one blue ball. As I did earlier, it's 5 red \u00d7 7 blue = 35.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as C(5, 1) \u00d7 C(7, 1) = 5 \u00d7 7 = 35.\n\nAnd the total number of ways to pick any two balls is C(12, 2) = 66.\n\nSo, probability is 35/66.\n\nAlternatively, using probabilities directly, I have two scenarios: red then blue or blue then red.\n\nEach has a probability of (5/12)(7/11) = 35/132, and (7/12)(5/11) = 35/132.\n\nAdding them up gives 70/132, which simplifies to 35/66.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer.\n\nI think 35/66 is the correct probability.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret \"one ball of each color\"? Maybe I need to consider that the order doesn't matter, but in the addition of probabilities, I already covered both possible orders.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nLet's say, the probability of picking a red ball given that the first ball was blue, and so on.\n\nBut actually, that might complicate things more than necessary.\n\nGiven that both methods I used give me the same answer, I'm confident that 35/66 is the correct probability.\n\nSo, the probability of picking one ball of each color is 35/66.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{35}{66}} \\]"
