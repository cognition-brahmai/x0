        "content": "The golden age of piracy refers to a period from the late 17th century to the early 18th century when piracy reached its peak, particularly in the Caribbean region. Key events and figures of this era include the establishment of pirate republics like Port Royal and Tortuga, and notorious pirates such as Blackbeard, Calico Jack, and Anne Bonny.\n\nDuring this time, piracy had a significant impact on maritime trade and international relations. Pirates targeted merchant ships, disrupting trade routes and causing economic losses for colonial powers such as England, France, and Spain. This led to increased naval patrols and the establishment of anti-piracy laws and penalties.\n\nFurthermore, some pirates operated with the support or tolerance of certain governments, using piracy as a tool for political and economic gain. This blurred the lines between piracy and privateering, complicating international relations and leading to conflicts between nations.\n\nOverall, the golden age of piracy was a turbulent period that challenged established power structures and had lasting effects on maritime trade and global politics."
