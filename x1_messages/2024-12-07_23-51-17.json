        "content": "So the population of the town is increasing by 5% each year, and it's currently at 10,000. I need to find out what it will be after 3 years. Hmm, I remember that percentage increase can be calculated in a few ways. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 5% increase means. If something increases by 5%, it means it grows by 5% of its current value each year. So, for the first year, the increase would be 5% of 10,000.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n5% of 10,000 is (5/100) * 10,000 = 0.05 * 10,000 = 500.\n\nSo, after the first year, the population would be 10,000 + 500 = 10,500.\n\nNow, for the second year, the population increases by 5% again, but this time it's 5% of the new population, which is 10,500.\n\nSo, 5% of 10,500 is (5/100) * 10,500 = 0.05 * 10,500 = 525.\n\nTherefore, after the second year, the population would be 10,500 + 525 = 11,025.\n\nMoving on to the third year, again a 5% increase on the latest population, which is 11,025.\n\nSo, 5% of 11,025 is (5/100) * 11,025 = 0.05 * 11,025 = 551.25.\n\nAdding that to the previous population: 11,025 + 551.25 = 11,576.25.\n\nWait a minute, population can't be a fraction; you can't have a quarter of a person. So, maybe I should round that to the nearest whole number, which would be 11,576.\n\nBut, is there a better way to calculate this without doing the percentage increase year by year? I think there might be a formula for compound growth, similar to how interest accrues in a bank account.\n\nYes, the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the population growth is compounded annually, so n would be 1. The rate r is 5%, or 0.05 in decimal form, and t is 3 years.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\nA = 10,000 * (1 + 0.05/1)^(1*3) = 10,000 * (1 + 0.05)^3 = 10,000 * (1.05)^3.\n\nCalculating 1.05 to the power of 3: 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05.\n\nFirst, 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025.\n\nThen, 1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625.\n\nSo, A = 10,000 * 1.157625 = 11,576.25.\n\nAgain, I get 11,576.25, which I would round to 11,576.\n\nWait, but earlier I did it step by step and got the same result. So, it seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to check this? Maybe using the formula for compound interest is the most straightforward method.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for exponential growth: P * e^(rt), where e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the growth rate, and t is time.\n\nBut I think that's more applicable for continuous compounding, whereas population growth here is compounded annually.\n\nSo, sticking with the compound interest formula seems appropriate.\n\nTherefore, after 3 years, the population would be approximately 11,576.\n\nBut, to be precise, since population is always a whole number, and we can't have a fraction of a person, we should round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nIn this case, 11,576.25 rounds to 11,576.\n\nSo, the population after 3 years would be 11,576.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the population must be a whole number each year, we could round at each step.\n\nFor example, after the first year: 10,000 + 500 = 10,500.\n\nSecond year: 5% of 10,500 is 525, so 10,500 + 525 = 11,025.\n\nThird year: 5% of 11,025 is 551.25, which rounds to 551.\n\nSo, 11,025 + 551 = 11,576.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 11,576 is the correct population after 3 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11576} \\]"
