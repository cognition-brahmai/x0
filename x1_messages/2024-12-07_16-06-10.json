        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units of product each day, and each unit needs 3 hours of labor. I need to find out how many hours of labor are required for 10 days of production.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in 10 days. Since the factory makes 500 units per day, for 10 days it would be:\n\n500 units/day \u00d7 10 days = 5,000 units\n\nNow, each of these 5,000 units requires 3 hours of labor. So, to find the total labor hours needed, I multiply the number of units by the labor hours per unit:\n\n5,000 units \u00d7 3 hours/unit = 15,000 hours\n\nTherefore, 15,000 hours of labor are required for 10 days of production.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 500 units per day, over 10 days that's indeed 5,000 units. And each unit requires 3 hours of labor, so multiplying 5,000 by 3 should give 15,000 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of it in another way. If each day requires 500 units \u00d7 3 hours/unit = 1,500 hours per day, then for 10 days it would be 1,500 hours/day \u00d7 10 days = 15,000 hours.\n\nEither way, I arrive at the same total of 15,000 hours of labor for 10 days of production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15000} \\]"
