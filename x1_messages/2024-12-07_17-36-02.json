        "content": "So I've got this puzzle here. Let's see if I can wrap my head around it. There are 100 houses in the town, and each house has one dog. So, that means there are 100 dogs in total. Now, every dog barks at exactly one cat, and there are also 100 cats in the town, each of which is scared of exactly one dog.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out how many animals are afraid of dogs. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the cats are scared of dogs. Each cat is scared of exactly one dog, so all 100 cats are afraid of dogs. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the question is about animals afraid of dogs. So, cats are afraid of dogs, but are there any other animals involved here? Let's see. The only animals mentioned are dogs and cats, so probably just these two.\n\nSo, if there are 100 cats and each is afraid of one dog, then the total number of animals afraid of dogs is 100, right?\n\nBut let me think deeper. Is there any possibility that some cats are afraid of the same dog, or is it a one-to-one relationship?\n\nThe problem says each dog barks at exactly one cat, and each cat is scared of exactly one dog. So, it sounds like a one-to-one correspondence between dogs and cats.\n\nSo, perhaps it's a matching where each dog corresponds to one cat, and each cat to one dog.\n\nIn that case, the number of cats afraid of dogs is 100, and since no other animals are mentioned, the total number of animals afraid of dogs is 100.\n\nBut the puzzle might be trying to trick me somehow. Let's see.\n\nWait a minute, the question is about animals afraid of dogs. Cats are afraid of dogs, but dogs themselves, do they fear any animals? The problem doesn't say that dogs are afraid of anything. It only says that dogs bark at cats, and cats are scared of dogs.\n\nSo, probably, only the cats are afraid of dogs, and dogs aren't afraid of any animals.\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals afraid of dogs is just the number of cats, which is 100.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose that some cats are afraid of multiple dogs, but the problem says each cat is scared of exactly one dog, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nSimilarly, each dog barks at exactly one cat, so it's a one-to-one matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are some dogs that aren't scared of any other dogs, but the problem doesn't mention dogs being afraid of each other.\n\nWait, the problem says \"animals afraid of dogs,\" not \"cats afraid of dogs.\" So, could there be dogs that are afraid of other dogs?\n\nBut the problem specifies that every dog barks at exactly one cat, and cats are scared of dogs, but doesn't say anything about dogs being scared of other dogs or any other animals.\n\nSo, probably, only the cats are afraid of dogs, and the dogs aren't afraid of any animals.\n\nHence, the total number of animals afraid of dogs is 100, which is the number of cats.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any dogs that are afraid of other dogs.\n\nThe problem doesn't rule that out, but it also doesn't provide any information about dogs being afraid of other dogs.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can't assume that dogs are not afraid of other dogs, but since it's not mentioned, maybe it's safe to assume that only cats are afraid of dogs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps dogs are only barking at cats and aren't afraid of any animals, while cats are only scared of dogs.\n\nGiven that, it seems that only cats are afraid of dogs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals afraid of dogs is 100.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think about it another way.\n\nSuppose we have 100 dogs and 100 cats, and each dog barks at exactly one cat, and each cat is scared of exactly one dog.\n\nThis sounds like a perfect matching between dogs and cats.\n\nSo, each dog is paired with one cat that it barks at, and each cat is paired with one dog that it's scared of.\n\nTherefore, all 100 cats are afraid of dogs, and there are no other animals in the town, so the total number of animals afraid of dogs is 100.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
