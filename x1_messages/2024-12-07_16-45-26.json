        "content": "So the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours, and I need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 150 miles at the same speed. Okay, first I should figure out the speed of the train.\n\nSpeed is usually calculated as distance divided by time, right? So, if the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours, its speed is 100 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 50 miles per hour.\n\nNow, if the train continues at the same speed, which is 50 miles per hour, and I need to find out how long it will take to travel 150 miles, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time = 150 miles / 50 miles per hour\n\nThat would be 3 hours.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using proportions. If 100 miles takes 2 hours, then 150 miles would take x hours.\n\nSo, set up a proportion:\n\n100 miles : 2 hours = 150 miles : x hours\n\nOr, 100/2 = 150/x\n\nThat simplifies to 50 = 150/x\n\nThen, solving for x, x = 150 / 50 = 3 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using the concept of unit rates.\n\nIf the train travels 100 miles in 2 hours, that's 50 miles per hour, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, for every hour, the train covers 50 miles.\n\nTo cover 150 miles, I can divide 150 by 50, which again gives me 3 hours.\n\nAlright, all these methods lead me to the same answer: 3 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the train's speed changes or if there are any other factors that might affect the travel time.\n\nThe problem states that the train continues at the same speed, so I can assume that the speed remains constant at 50 miles per hour.\n\nThere are no mentions of stops, acceleration, or deceleration, so I don't need to account for any of those variables.\n\nTherefore, the time to travel an additional 150 miles is 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"additional\" 150 miles. Does that mean total distance or just the extra distance?\n\nLet me read the question again: \"A train travels 100 miles in 2 hours. If the train continues at the same speed, how long will it take to travel an additional 150 miles?\"\n\nSo, it's asking for the time to travel just the additional 150 miles, not the total time for 100 + 150 miles.\n\nI think I've answered that correctly with 3 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the train is already in motion or starting from rest, but the problem seems to imply that it's already moving at that speed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for time, considering the rate is constant.\n\nSo, rate (r) = distance (d) / time (t)\n\nWe know r = 50 mph from the initial information.\n\nFor the additional distance, d = 150 miles, so t = d / r = 150 / 50 = 3 hours.\n\nEverything points to 3 hours being the correct answer.\n\nIs there any chance that the train's speed might change over time? The problem says it continues at the same speed, so I shouldn't assume any changes.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Miles and hours are consistent in this case.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the train might have to stop for any reasons, like picking up passengers or technical issues, but again, the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I have to assume ideal conditions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take the train 3 hours to travel the additional 150 miles at the same speed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
