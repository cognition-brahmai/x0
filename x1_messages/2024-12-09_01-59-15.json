        "content": "Let's see. So, the store sells packs that contain 4 pencils and 6 pens each. I need to figure out how many of these packs to buy to get at least 100 pencils and 150 pens.\n\nFirst, I should think about how many pencils and pens are in one pack. Each pack has 4 pencils and 6 pens. So, if I buy one pack, I get 4 pencils and 6 pens. If I buy two packs, I get 8 pencils and 12 pens, and so on.\n\nI need to reach at least 100 pencils and 150 pens. So, I need to find the smallest number of packs that will give me at least these amounts.\n\nLet me denote the number of packs as \\( p \\). Then, the total number of pencils will be \\( 4p \\), and the total number of pens will be \\( 6p \\).\n\nI need:\n\n\\( 4p \\geq 100 \\) (for pencils)\n\nand\n\n\\( 6p \\geq 150 \\) (for pens)\n\nI can solve these inequalities to find the minimum \\( p \\) that satisfies both conditions.\n\nFirst, solving \\( 4p \\geq 100 \\):\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\( p \\geq 25 \\)\n\nSecond, solving \\( 6p \\geq 150 \\):\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n\\( p \\geq 25 \\)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that.\n\n\\( 6p \\geq 150 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n\\( p \\geq 25 \\)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, both inequalities give me \\( p \\geq 25 \\). Therefore, I need to buy at least 25 packs to meet the requirements.\n\nBut let me check if 25 packs actually provide enough pencils and pens.\n\nIf \\( p = 25 \\):\n\nPencils: \\( 4 \\times 25 = 100 \\)\n\nPens: \\( 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\)\n\nPerfect, it meets both requirements exactly.\n\nIf I buy 25 packs, I get exactly 100 pencils and 150 pens, which is exactly what is needed.\n\nSo, the answer should be 25 packs.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe there's a way to get exactly 100 pencils and 150 pens with fewer packs if I consider that the packs contain both pencils and pens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider if I can buy different numbers of packs for pencils and pens, but the problem says that packs contain both 4 pencils and 6 pens, and I have to buy whole packs.\n\nSo, it seems I have to buy packs that contain both pencils and pens in the ratio of 4:6.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers involved or something like that, but I think the inequality approach is sufficient here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the total number of items per pack.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I need 100 pencils and each pack has 4 pencils.\n\nSo, the number of packs needed to satisfy the pencils is:\n\n\\( 100 \\div 4 = 25 \\) packs.\n\nSimilarly, for pens:\n\n\\( 150 \\div 6 = 25 \\) packs.\n\nSince both give me the same number of packs, 25, that should be the answer.\n\nBut what if the numbers were different, say I needed 100 pencils and 151 pens?\n\nThen, for pencils: 100 / 4 = 25 packs\n\nFor pens: 151 / 6 \u2248 25.1667, which means I need to round up to 26 packs.\n\nIn that case, I would need to buy 26 packs to satisfy both requirements.\n\nBut in this problem, both require 25 packs, so 25 packs is sufficient.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if 25 packs give exactly 150 pens.\n\nYes, 25 packs \u00d7 6 pens/pack = 150 pens.\n\nSo, 25 packs are sufficient.\n\nIs there a possibility of buying fewer packs and still meeting the requirements?\n\nWell, if I buy 24 packs:\n\nPencils: 24 \u00d7 4 = 96 pencils (which is less than 100)\n\nPens: 24 \u00d7 6 = 144 pens (which is less than 150)\n\nSo, that's not enough.\n\nTherefore, 25 packs is the minimal number required.\n\nAlternatively, if I buy 25 packs, I get exactly 100 pencils and 150 pens, which matches the requirements perfectly.\n\nSo, the answer is 25 packs.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if buying 25 packs is the only option.\n\nSuppose the packs could be bought in fractions, but the problem states that packs are whole units, so I can only buy integer numbers of packs.\n\nTherefore, 25 is the minimal number of packs needed.\n\nAlternatively, if the store sells pencils and pens individually, but according to the problem, packs contain both, and I have to buy whole packs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25 packs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
