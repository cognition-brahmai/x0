        "content": "So you're asking about an American singer-songwriter who released her debut album called \"Little Earthquakes\" in 1992, right? I think I might know who that is. Let me think for a second.\n\nI remember that in the early '90s, there were a lot of talented singer-songwriters coming into the music scene. One name that comes to mind is Tori Amos. She was known for her piano-driven songs and powerful, emotive vocals. I believe her debut album was indeed called \"Little Earthquakes,\" which was released in 1992.\n\nLet me just double-check the details to make sure I'm correct. Tori Amos is an American singer-songwriter who started her career in the '90s. Her first album, \"Little Earthquakes,\" was released on April 21, 1992, under East West Records. The album featured hits like \"Me and a Gun\" and \"Silent All These Years,\" which showcased her unique style and lyrical depth.\n\nSo, if that matches the description you're thinking of, then yes, it's Tori Amos. She has had a long and successful career, known for her honesty and vulnerability in her songwriting. Plus, her musical talents extend beyond singing; she's also an accomplished pianist.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to know about her or that album? I can dig up more details if you're interested."
