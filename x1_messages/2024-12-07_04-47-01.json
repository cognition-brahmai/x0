        "content": "Let's see. I start with 50 apples in the basket. Then I take out 10 apples, so that leaves me with 50 - 10 = 40 apples. After that, I put back 5 apples, so now I have 40 + 5 = 45 apples in the basket.\n\nNow, I want to have a total of 60 apples in the basket. So, I need to find out how many apples I need to add to the current 45 apples to reach 60.\n\nThat means, 45 + x = 60, where x is the number of apples I need to add.\n\nTo find x, I can subtract 45 from 60: x = 60 - 45 = 15.\n\nSo, I need to add 15 apples to the basket to have a total of 60 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting with 50 apples,\n\ntake out 10: 50 - 10 = 40,\n\nput back 5: 40 + 5 = 45.\n\nNow, to get to 60, 60 - 45 = 15.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of apples needed is 60, and currently, after taking out 10 and putting back 5, there are 45 apples.\n\nSo, apples needed to add: 60 - 45 = 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the net effect of taking out 10 and putting back 5.\n\nTaking out 10 and putting back 5 is like net taking out 5 apples.\n\nBecause 10 - 5 = 5.\n\nSo, from the original 50, net taking out 5 apples means 50 - 5 = 45 apples.\n\nNow, to reach 60, I need to add apples to the 45 to make it 60.\n\nWhich again is 60 - 45 = 15 apples.\n\nSo, either way, it seems I need to add 15 apples.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I consider the sequence of actions:\n\n1. Start with 50 apples.\n\n2. Take out 10 apples: 50 - 10 = 40.\n\n3. Put back 5 apples: 40 + 5 = 45.\n\n4. Add x apples to reach 60: 45 + x = 60.\n\nSolving for x: x = 60 - 45 = 15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of total apples added and removed.\n\nTotal apples removed: 10.\n\nTotal apples added back: 5.\n\nNet removal: 10 - 5 = 5 apples.\n\nSo, from 50, net removal of 5 apples gives 45 apples.\n\nTo reach 60, I need to add 15 apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the target of 60 apples, and the net effect of my actions so far.\n\nI started with 50, and after removing 10 and adding 5, I have 45.\n\nSo, from 50 to 45, that's a net reduction of 5.\n\nTo reach 60 from 45, I need to add 15 apples.\n\nAlternatively, to reach 60 from the original 50, I would need to add 10 apples.\n\nBut since I already removed 10 and added back 5, which is net removal of 5, I need to add enough apples to not only make up for the net removal but also to reach the target of 60.\n\nSo, to counter the net removal of 5, I need to add 5 apples just to get back to 50.\n\nThen, to go from 50 to 60, I need to add another 10 apples.\n\nSo, total apples to add: 5 + 10 = 15 apples.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, I need to add 15 apples to the basket to have a total of 60 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
