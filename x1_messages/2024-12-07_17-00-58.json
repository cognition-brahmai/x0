        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train going from City A to City B at 60 miles per hour. On the way back, from City B to City A, it travels at half that speed, which would be 30 miles per hour, and this return trip takes twice as long as the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're supposed to find the average speed for the entire round trip. Average speed is usually calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find those two values, I should be able to find the average speed.\n\nLet me denote the distance between City A and City B as \\( d \\) miles. Since the train goes from A to B at 60 mph, the time taken for that part of the trip would be \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours.\n\nOn the return trip, from B to A, the train travels at half the speed, which is 30 mph, so the time taken for that part would be \\( \\frac{d}{30} \\) hours.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that the return trip takes twice as long as the go trip. Let me check if that matches with what I've just calculated. The time for the go trip is \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\), and the time for the return trip is \\( \\frac{d}{30} \\). Indeed, \\( \\frac{d}{30} \\) is twice \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\), because \\( \\frac{d}{30} = 2 \\times \\frac{d}{60} \\). So, that checks out.\n\nNext, the total distance for the round trip would be \\( d \\) miles going from A to B and another \\( d \\) miles coming back from B to A, so total distance is \\( 2d \\) miles.\n\nThe total time for the round trip is the sum of the time going and the time returning, which is \\( \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{30} \\) hours. Let me simplify that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{30} = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{2d}{60} = \\frac{3d}{60} = \\frac{d}{20} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSo, total time is \\( \\frac{d}{20} \\) hours.\n\nNow, average speed is total distance divided by total time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average speed} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{20}} = 2d \\times \\frac{20}{d} = 40 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But I recall that there's a common mistake people make when calculating average speeds for round trips, especially when the speeds are different in each direction. Some might think to just average the two speeds, which would be \\( \\frac{60 + 30}{2} = 45 \\) mph, but that's not correct in this context.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, distance from A to B is \\( d \\) miles, speed is 60 mph, so time is \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours.\n\nReturn distance is also \\( d \\) miles, speed is 30 mph, so time is \\( \\frac{d}{30} \\) hours.\n\nTotal distance is \\( 2d \\) miles.\n\nTotal time is \\( \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{30} = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{2d}{60} = \\frac{3d}{60} = \\frac{d}{20} \\) hours.\n\nTherefore, average speed is \\( \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{20}} = 40 \\) mph.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it without assigning a variable for distance. Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is, say, 60 miles. That might make the numbers easier to work with.\n\nSo, distance = 60 miles.\n\nTime from A to B: \\( \\frac{60}{60} = 1 \\) hour.\n\nTime from B to A: \\( \\frac{60}{30} = 2 \\) hours.\n\nTotal distance: \\( 60 + 60 = 120 \\) miles.\n\nTotal time: \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\) hours.\n\nAverage speed: \\( \\frac{120}{3} = 40 \\) mph.\n\nWait, that gives the same result. Let me try with a different distance to confirm.\n\nSuppose distance is 30 miles.\n\nTime from A to B: \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\) hours.\n\nTime from B to A: \\( \\frac{30}{30} = 1 \\) hour.\n\nTotal distance: \\( 30 + 30 = 60 \\) miles.\n\nTotal time: \\( 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 \\) hours.\n\nAverage speed: \\( \\frac{60}{1.5} = 40 \\) mph.\n\nAgain, 40 mph.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the general case with distance \\( d \\):\n\nTime go: \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\)\n\nTime return: \\( \\frac{d}{30} \\)\n\nTotal distance: \\( 2d \\)\n\nTotal time: \\( \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{30} = \\frac{d}{20} \\)\n\nAverage speed: \\( \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{20}} = 40 \\) mph.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nBut I recall that there's a formula for average speed when the distances are the same but speeds are different: \\( \\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times v_1 \\times v_2}{v_1 + v_2} \\), where \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) are the speeds in each direction.\n\nLet me apply that formula to see if I get the same result.\n\nHere, \\( v_1 = 60 \\) mph and \\( v_2 = 30 \\) mph.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times 60 \\times 30}{60 + 30} = \\frac{2 \\times 1800}{90} = \\frac{3600}{90} = 40 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nAgain, 40 mph. So, all methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought that the average speed should be the harmonic mean of the two speeds when the distances are equal, which is exactly what that formula represents. And indeed, it's coming out to be 40 mph.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about just averaging the speeds: \\( \\frac{60 + 30}{2} = 45 \\) mph, but that's the arithmetic mean, which is not the correct way to calculate average speed in this scenario.\n\nSo, it's important to remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time, not the arithmetic mean of the speeds.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the entire journey as two parts: Part 1 (A to B) at 60 mph and Part 2 (B to A) at 30 mph.\n\nThe time weighted average might be another way to think about it, but in reality, it's still total distance over total time.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of harmonic mean, which is more appropriate for rates and speeds.\n\nThe harmonic mean of two speeds, when the distances are equal, is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{harmonic mean} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{v_1} + \\frac{1}{v_2}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{1}{30}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{2}{60}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{3}{60}} = \\frac{2 \\times 60}{3} = \\frac{120}{3} = 40 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nAgain, 40 mph.\n\nSo, all these different approaches confirm that the average speed for the entire round trip is 40 miles per hour.\n\nI think I've beaten this problem to death, but it's good to see that no matter which method I use, the answer remains consistent.\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire round trip is 40 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
