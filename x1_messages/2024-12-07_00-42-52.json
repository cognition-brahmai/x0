        "content": "Let's see. So, the car rental company charges $20 per day for renting a car, and there's an additional $10 for insurance. If I rent a car for 5 days with insurance, how much will that cost me in total?\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the cost of renting the car for 5 days. Since it's $20 per day, I should multiply 20 by 5. Let me do that: 20 times 5 is 100. So, the rental cost alone is $100.\n\nNext, there's the insurance. It's an additional $10. So, I need to add that to the rental cost. That means 100 plus 10, which is 110.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there any other cost involved? The question says \"plus an additional $10 for insurance,\" and that's it. So, I think $110 is the total cost.\n\nBut let me think again. Sometimes, there are extra fees or taxes that might apply. However, the question doesn't mention any other charges, so I guess it's just the rental cost and the insurance.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the insurance is per day or a one-time fee. The question says \"$10 for insurance,\" but it doesn't specify if it's per day or a flat fee. If it's per day, then for 5 days, it would be 10 times 5, which is 50, plus the 100 for the car rental, totaling $150.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. If the insurance is per day, then it should be multiplied by the number of days. But the question says \"$10 for insurance,\" which could be interpreted as a one-time fee.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me look at the question again: \"a car rental company charges $20 per day for renting a car plus an additional $10 for insurance. If you rent a car for 5 days with insurance, how much will you pay?\"\n\nIt says \"additional $10 for insurance.\" It doesn't specify if it's per day or a one-time fee. Maybe it's a one-time fee, meaning no matter how many days you rent the car, you only pay $10 for insurance once.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total cost would be the rental cost plus the insurance fee: $100 plus $10, equaling $110.\n\nBut perhaps the insurance is required per day, like you have to pay $10 each day for insurance. In that case, for 5 days, it would be $50 for insurance, plus $100 for the car rental, totaling $150.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the question says \"additional $10 for insurance\" without specifying per day, it's probably a one-time fee.\n\nSo, I'll go with the total cost being $110.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{110} \\]"
