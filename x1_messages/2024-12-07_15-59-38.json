        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to write a Go application that uses the Gorilla WebSocket library to make a real-time chat server. I've used Go before, but I'm not super experienced with websockets or the Gorilla library, so this should be a good learning experience.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a basic Go project structure. I'll create a new directory for my project and initialize a new Go module.\n\n```\nmkdir chat-server\ncd chat-server\ngo mod init chat-server\n```\n\nNext, I need to get the Gorilla WebSocket library. I can do that using `go get`.\n\n```\ngo get github.com/gorilla/websocket\n```\n\nOkay, now I need to think about the architecture of my chat server. Since it's a real-time chat server, I need to handle multiple clients connecting via websockets, and I need to broadcast messages from one client to all other connected clients.\n\nI should probably have a list or a map to keep track of all the connected clients. Each client will have a websocket connection associated with it. When a new message comes in from one client, I need to broadcast that message to all other clients.\n\nLet me sketch out a rough plan:\n\n1. Set up a HTTP server that serves a simple HTML page for the chat interface.\n\n2. Set up an endpoint for websocket connections, say `/chat`.\n\n3. When a client connects to `/chat`, accept the websocket connection and add it to a list of connected clients.\n\n4. Listen for messages from each client. When a message is received, broadcast that message to all other connected clients.\n\n5. Handle client disconnections gracefully by removing the client from the list of connected clients.\n\nI need to think about how to manage concurrent access to the list of connected clients since multiple goroutines might be accessing it simultaneously.\n\nMaybe I can use a mutex to synchronize access to the list.\n\nAlso, I need to consider how to identify each client. Maybe assign each client a unique ID when they connect.\n\nLet me start by writing the HTML for the chat interface. It can be very simple: a textarea to display messages and an input field to type messages.\n\nI'll create a file called `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Chat</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div>\n        <textarea id=\"chat-log\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"50\" readonly></textarea><br>\n        <input id=\"message-input\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Type a message...\">\n        <button onclick=\"sendMessage()\">Send</button>\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n        const socket = new WebSocket(\"ws://\" + location.host + \"/chat\");\n\n        socket.onmessage = function(event) {\n            const log = document.getElementById(\"chat-log\");\n            log.value += event.data + \"\\n\";\n        };\n\n        function sendMessage() {\n            const input = document.getElementById(\"message-input\");\n            const message = input.value;\n            socket.send(message);\n            input.value = \"\";\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is a very basic HTML page with a textarea to display chat messages and an input field to type messages. The JavaScript code sets up a WebSocket connection to `/chat` and handles incoming messages by appending them to the textarea. There's also a function to send messages when the send button is clicked.\n\nNow, I need to set up the HTTP server to serve this HTML file and handle websocket connections.\n\nI'll create a `main.go` file:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"html/template\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/websocket\"\n)\n\nvar upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{\n\tReadBufferSize:  1024,\n\tWriteBufferSize: 1024,\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", serveHome)\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/chat\", handleChat)\n\tlog.Println(\"Listening on :8080...\")\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"ListenAndServe: \", err)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc serveHome(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\ttmpl := template.Must(template.ParseFiles(\"index.html\"))\n\ttmpl.Execute(w, nil)\n}\n\nfunc handleChat(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tconn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Upgrade error:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdefer conn.Close()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tmessageType, message, err := conn.ReadMessage()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Read error:\", err)\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Received: %s\", message)\n\t\terr = conn.WriteMessage(messageType, message)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Write error:\", err)\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a basic setup where the root URL serves the HTML page, and the `/chat` endpoint upgrades the HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection. The `handleChat` function reads messages from the client and echoes them back.\n\nBut this is just echoing messages back to the same client. I need to modify it to broadcast messages to all connected clients.\n\nFirst, I need to keep track of all connected clients. I'll use a map with client connections as values.\n\nI'll define a `client` struct to hold the websocket connection and a unique ID.\n\n```go\ntype client struct {\n\tid       string\n\tconn     *websocket.Conn\n\tsend     chan []byte\n\tdisconnect chan struct{}\n}\n\nvar (\n\tclients    = make(map[string]*client)\n\tclientMu   = &sync.Mutex{}\n)\n```\n\nI'll need a channel to send messages to each client and a channel to handle disconnections.\n\nAlso, I need to generate unique IDs for each client. I can use the `uuid` package for that.\n\nFirst, I need to import the necessary packages.\n\n```\nimport (\n\t\"html/template\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"sync\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/websocket\"\n\t\"github.com/google/uuid\"\n)\n```\n\nWait, I need to get the `uuid` package.\n\n```\ngo get github.com/google/uuid\n```\n\nNow, I need to modify the `handleChat` function to handle multiple clients and broadcast messages.\n\nHere's an updated version:\n\n```go\nfunc handleChat(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tconn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Upgrade error:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tid := uuid.New().String()\n\tclient := &client{\n\t\tid:       id,\n\t\tconn:     conn,\n\t\tsend:     make(chan []byte, 256),\n\t\tdisconnect: make(chan struct{}),\n\t}\n\n\tclientMu.Lock()\n\tclients[id] = client\n\tclientMu.Unlock()\n\n\tgo client.writePump()\n\tgo client.readPump()\n\n\t// Wait for disconnection\n\t<-client.disconnect\n}\n\nfunc (c *client) readPump() {\n\tdefer func() {\n\t\tc.conn.Close()\n\t\tclientMu.Lock()\n\t\tdelete(clients, c.id)\n\t\tclientMu.Unlock()\n\t\tclose(c.send)\n\t}()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tmessageType, message, err := c.conn.ReadMessage()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Read error:\", err)\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t\tif messageType == websocket.TextMessage {\n\t\t\tbroadcast(message)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc (c *client) writePump() {\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase message, ok := <-c.send:\n\t\t\tif !ok {\n\t\t\t\t// The send channel was closed, so finish up\n\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\terr := c.conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, message)\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Write error:\", err)\n\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc broadcast(message []byte) {\n\tclientMu.Lock()\n\tdefer clientMu.Unlock()\n\n\tfor _, client := range clients {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase client.send <- message:\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\tclose(client.send)\n\t\t\tdelete(clients, client.id)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, when a new client connects, I assign them a unique ID and add them to the `clients` map. I start two goroutines for each client: `readPump` and `writePump`.\n\nThe `readPump` goroutine reads messages from the client and broadcasts them to all other clients using the `broadcast` function. When the client disconnects, it removes the client from the map and closes the send channel.\n\nThe `writePump` goroutine listens for messages on the client's send channel and writes them back to the client via the websocket connection.\n\nThe `broadcast` function sends the message to all clients by writing to their send channels. If a send channel is full, it closes the channel and removes the client from the map.\n\nI need to make sure that access to the `clients` map is synchronized using a mutex to prevent race conditions.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where a client sends a message too quickly, causing the send channel to fill up. In such cases, I close the channel and remove the client.\n\nThis seems like a good start. I should test this to see if it works.\n\nI can run the server and open multiple browser tabs to connect to the chat server and see if messages are broadcasted correctly.\n\nLet me try running the server.\n\n```\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nThen, open `http://localhost:8080` in a few browser tabs.\n\nType a message in one tab and see if it appears in the other tabs in real-time.\n\nHmm, it seems like messages are being echoed back to the same client as well. I need to make sure that when a message is broadcasted, it's sent to all clients except the one that sent it.\n\nWait, in the current implementation, the `broadcast` function sends the message to all clients, including the one that sent it. I need to modify it to exclude the sender.\n\nTo do that, I need to pass the sender's ID to the `broadcast` function and have it exclude that client when sending the message.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nFirst, modify the `readPump` method to pass the sender's ID when broadcasting:\n\n```go\nfunc (c *client) readPump() {\n\tdefer func() {\n\t\tc.conn.Close()\n\t\tclientMu.Lock()\n\t\tdelete(clients, c.id)\n\t\tclientMu.Unlock()\n\t\tclose(c.send)\n\t}()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tmessageType, message, err := c.conn.ReadMessage()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Read error:\", err)\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t\tif messageType == websocket.TextMessage {\n\t\t\tbroadcast(message, c.id)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThen, modify the `broadcast` function to exclude the sender:\n\n```go\nfunc broadcast(message []byte, excludeID string) {\n\tclientMu.Lock()\n\tdefer clientMu.Unlock()\n\n\tfor id, client := range clients {\n\t\tif id != excludeID {\n\t\t\tselect {\n\t\t\tcase client.send <- message:\n\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\tclose(client.send)\n\t\t\t\tdelete(clients, id)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis should ensure that the message is not sent back to the client that sent it.\n\nLet me test this again.\n\nRun the server:\n\n```\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nOpen multiple tabs and test messaging.\n\nLooks good! Messages are being broadcasted to all other clients except the sender.\n\nBut, in a chat application, it's common for the server to also send system messages, like when a user connects or disconnects.\n\nI can enhance the server to send such messages.\n\nFor example, when a new client connects, the server can broadcast a message saying \"[Client ID] has joined the chat.\"\n\nSimilarly, when a client disconnects, broadcast \"[Client ID] has left the chat.\"\n\nTo do this, I need to generate a unique identifier for each client. Maybe use their ID or assign them a username.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll use their ID for now.\n\nModify the `handleChat` function to send a join message when a client connects.\n\n```go\nfunc handleChat(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tconn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Upgrade error:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tid := uuid.New().String()\n\tclient := &client{\n\t\tid:       id,\n\t\tconn:     conn,\n\t\tsend:     make(chan []byte, 256),\n\t\tdisconnect: make(chan struct{}),\n\t}\n\n\tclientMu.Lock()\n\tclients[id] = client\n\tclientMu.Unlock()\n\n\t// Send join message\n\tjoinMessage := []byte(\"[\" + id + \"] has joined the chat.\")\n\tbroadcast(joinMessage, id)\n\n\tgo client.writePump()\n\tgo client.readPump()\n\n\t// Wait for disconnection\n\t<-client.disconnect\n\n\t// Send leave message\n\tleaveMessage := []byte(\"[\" + id + \"] has left the chat.\")\n\tbroadcast(leaveMessage, id)\n}\n```\n\nNow, when a client connects, a join message is broadcasted, and when they disconnect, a leave message is broadcasted.\n\nI should also handle cases where clients disconnect unexpectedly, like closing the browser tab.\n\nIn the `readPump` method, when the client disconnects, I need to close the send channel and remove the client from the map, which is already being done.\n\nLet me test this again.\n\nRun the server and open a few tabs. I should see join messages when I open new tabs and leave messages when I close them.\n\nLooks good!\n\nAnother thing I can do is to include the client's ID in front of their messages, so it's clear who sent what.\n\nModify the client's JavaScript to include the ID in messages.\n\nBut, in this setup, the server assigns the ID, so the client doesn't know its own ID.\n\nMaybe I can send the client their own ID when they connect.\n\nI can modify the `writePump` method to send the client their ID when they first connect.\n\nAdd a method to send the client their ID.\n\n```go\nfunc (c *client) writePump() {\n\tc.send <- []byte(\"Your ID: \" + c.id)\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase message, ok := <-c.send:\n\t\t\tif !ok {\n\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\terr := c.conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, message)\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Write error:\", err)\n\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow, when a client connects, they receive a message with their ID.\n\nOn the client side, I can display this ID or use it for something, but for now, I'll just display it in the chat log.\n\nIn the JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nsocket.onmessage = function(event) {\n    const log = document.getElementById(\"chat-log\");\n    log.value += event.data + \"\\n\";\n};\n```\n\nThis will display the \"Your ID: XXX\" message in the textarea.\n\nNow, to include the ID in front of messages, I can modify the `readPump` method to prepend the ID to the message before broadcasting.\n\nBut actually, it's better to have the server prepend the ID to the message.\n\nSo, in the `readPump` method:\n\n```go\nfunc (c *client) readPump() {\n\tdefer func() {\n\t\tc.conn.Close()\n\t\tclientMu.Lock()\n\t\tdelete(clients, c.id)\n\t\tclientMu.Unlock()\n\t\tclose(c.send)\n\t}()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tmessageType, message, err := c.conn.ReadMessage()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Read error:\", err)\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t\tif messageType == websocket.TextMessage {\n\t\t\tfullMessage := []byte(\"[\" + c.id + \"] \" + string(message))\n\t\t\tbroadcast(fullMessage, c.id)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow, the server prepends the client's ID to the message before broadcasting.\n\nLet me test this.\n\nOpen multiple tabs, send messages, and see if the IDs are correctly prepended.\n\nPerfect!\n\nOne thing to note is that UUIDs are quite long and not very user-friendly. Maybe I can generate shorter IDs or allow users to set their own usernames.\n\nBut for now, this works fine for demonstration purposes.\n\nAnother improvement could be to limit the number of clients that can connect to prevent abuse or resource exhaustion.\n\nI can add a maximum client limit and reject new connections once that limit is reached.\n\nDefine a constant for the maximum number of clients:\n\n```go\nconst maxClients = 100\n```\n\nThen, in `handleChat`:\n\n```go\nclientMu.Lock()\nif len(clients) >= maxClients {\n\tclientMu.Unlock()\n\tlog.Println(\"Maximum clients reached. Rejecting new connection.\")\n\treturn\n}\nclients[id] = client\nclientMu.Unlock()\n```\n\nThis way, if the number of clients exceeds `maxClients`, new connections are rejected.\n\nI should also think about how to handle heartbeats or ping-pong messages to keep the connections alive, especially in environments like mobile networks or proxies that might close inactive connections.\n\nThe Gorilla WebSocket library provides options for handling ping and pong messages.\n\nI can set the `PingWriter` and `PongHandler` in the `Upgrader` to handle pings and pongs.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\n```go\nvar upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{\n\tReadBufferSize:  1024,\n\tWriteBufferSize: 1024,\n\tCheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {\n\t\treturn true\n\t},\n\tEnableCompression: true,\n}\n\nfunc handleChat(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tconn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Upgrade error:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdefer conn.Close()\n\n\tconn.SetPingHandler(func(appData string) error {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Received ping:\", appData)\n\t\treturn conn.WriteControl(websocket.PongMessage, []byte(\"pong\"), time.Now().Add(time.Second*5))\n\t})\n\n\tconn.SetPongHandler(func(appData string) error {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Received pong:\", appData)\n\t\treturn nil\n\t})\n\n\t// Rest of the handleChat function...\n}\n```\n\nThis sets custom ping and pong handlers for each connection.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the default handlers by not setting custom ones, and the library will handle pings and pongs automatically.\n\nI think for now, I'll rely on the default handlers to keep it simple.\n\nAnother consideration is error handling. In the current implementation, if there's an error reading or writing messages, the connection is closed.\n\nI should make sure that all possible error cases are handled gracefully, without crashing the server.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up when clients disconnect.\n\nIn the `readPump` method, I have a defer statement that closes the connection and removes the client from the map.\n\nSimilarly, in the `writePump` method, I close the send channel when finishing.\n\nThis should handle most cases, but I should test various failure scenarios to ensure the server remains stable.\n\nLet me think about security aspects.\n\nFirst, since this is a chat server, I need to handle message content appropriately to prevent XSS attacks if the messages are displayed in HTML.\n\nIn the current HTML, messages are appended to a textarea, which is safer than appending to HTML elements, as textareas escape HTML characters.\n\nBut still, it's good practice to escape any user input to prevent potential security issues.\n\nIn Go, I can use the `html.EscapeString` function to escape messages before broadcasting them.\n\nImport the `html` package:\n\n```\nimport \"html\"\n```\n\nThen, in the `readPump` method:\n\n```go\nfullMessage := []byte(\"[\" + c.id + \"] \" + html.EscapeString(string(message)))\nbroadcast(fullMessage, c.id)\n```\n\nThis ensures that any HTML characters in the message are escaped and displayed as literals.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider rate limiting to prevent a single client from spamming the server with too many messages.\n\nI can implement a message rate limiter per client.\n\nGo's `tokenbucket` package can be used for rate limiting, but for simplicity, I can use a channel with a limited buffer to throttle messages.\n\nFor example, create a channel with a buffer size that limits the number of messages a client can send per second.\n\nBut implementing a proper rate limiter is beyond the scope of this exercise, so I'll leave it for now.\n\nAnother aspect is handling large numbers of clients.\n\nGorilla WebSocket is designed to handle many concurrent connections, but I need to make sure that the server can handle the load.\n\nI can use Go's built-in tools to monitor CPU and memory usage and adjust accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should consider deploying the server with a reverse proxy like Nginx to handle SSL termination, load balancing, and other features.\n\nFor now, since this is a simple demo, I'll skip that part.\n\nI should also think about logging.\n\nIn the current implementation, I'm using `log.Println` for logging errors and messages.\n\nFor a production system, I might want to use a more robust logging mechanism, like the `logrus` package, which provides more features like log levels and structured logging.\n\nBut for this demo, basic logging is sufficient.\n\nLet me see if there are any other features I can add.\n\nPerhaps support for private messages, where a user can send a message to another specific user.\n\nTo implement this, clients would need to send messages in a specific format, like `/msg UserID message content`.\n\nThen, the server would parse the message, extract the target user ID, and forward the message only to that user.\n\nThis would require modifying the `readPump` method to check for such commands and handle them accordingly.\n\nBut for a basic chat server, I'll leave this feature out for now.\n\nAnother feature could be preserving chat history, so when a new client connects, they receive previous messages.\n\nTo implement this, I can maintain a ring buffer of recent messages and send them to new clients when they connect.\n\nAgain, for simplicity, I'll omit this feature.\n\nOne more thing: handling multiple servers for scalability.\n\nIf I need to scale the chat server to handle more load, I can set up multiple instances behind a load balancer.\n\nHowever, in that case, broadcasting messages would need to be handled across multiple servers, possibly using a message broker like Redis or Kafka.\n\nBut for a single-server setup, this isn't necessary.\n\nGiven that, I think the current implementation is sufficient for a basic real-time chat server.\n\nLet me do a final test to ensure everything works as expected.\n\nRun the server:\n\n```\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nOpen multiple browser tabs and test sending messages, closing tabs to simulate disconnections, and checking that join and leave messages are broadcasted correctly.\n\nEverything seems to be working fine.\n\nI can also check the server logs to see if there are any errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nI think this completes the task of creating a real-time chat server using Go and the Gorilla WebSocket library.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a real-time chat server using Go and the Gorilla WebSocket library, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.\n2. Install the Gorilla WebSocket library:\n   ```sh\n   go get github.com/gorilla/websocket\n   ```\n3. Install the UUID library for generating unique client IDs:\n   ```sh\n   go get github.com/google/uuid\n   ```\n\n### Project Structure\n```\nchat-server/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.go\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 index.html\n```\n\n### Implementation Code\n\n#### `index.html`\nA simple HTML page for the chat interface.\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Chat</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div>\n        <textarea id=\"chat-log\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"50\" readonly></textarea><br>\n        <input id=\"message-input\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Type a message...\">\n        <button onclick=\"sendMessage()\">Send</button>\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n        const socket = new WebSocket(\"ws://\" + location.host + \"/chat\");\n\n        socket.onmessage = function(event) {\n            const log = document.getElementById(\"chat-log\");\n            log.value += event.data + \"\\n\";\n        };\n\n        function sendMessage() {\n            const input = document.getElementById(\"message-input\");\n            const message = input.value;\n            socket.send(message);\n            input.value = \"\";\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### `main.go`\nThe Go code for the chat server.\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"html/template\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"sync\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/websocket\"\n\t\"github.com/google/uuid\"\n)\n\nvar (\n\tupgrader = websocket.Upgrader{\n\t\tReadBufferSize:  1024,\n\t\tWriteBufferSize: 1024,\n\t\tCheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {\n\t\t\treturn true\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\tclients    = make(map[string]*client)\n\tclientMu   = &sync.Mutex{}\n\tmaxClients = 100\n)\n\ntype client struct {\n\tid       string\n\tconn     *websocket.Conn\n\tsend     chan []byte\n\tdisconnect chan struct{}\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", serveHome)\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/chat\", handleChat)\n\tlog.Println(\"Listening on :8080...\")\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"ListenAndServe: \", err)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc serveHome(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\ttmpl := template.Must(template.ParseFiles(\"index.html\"))\n\ttmpl.Execute(w, nil)\n}\n\nfunc handleChat(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tconn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Upgrade error:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tclientMu.Lock()\n\tif len(clients) >= maxClients {\n\t\tclientMu.Unlock()\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Maximum clients reached.
