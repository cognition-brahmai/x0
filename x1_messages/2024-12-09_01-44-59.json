        "content": "Let's tackle this age problem step by step. So, we have Sarah and her brother Tom, and we're trying to figure out how old Sarah is right now.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Sarah is twice as old as Tom. That means if we let Tom's current age be something, say T years, then Sarah's age would be 2T years. Got it?\n\nNow, the second part says that five years ago, Sarah was three times as old as Tom. Five years ago, Sarah would have been 2T - 5 years old, and Tom would have been T - 5 years old. According to the problem, at that time, Sarah's age was three times Tom's age. So, we can write that as:\n\n2T - 5 = 3(T - 5)\n\nAlright, now we need to solve for T. Let's expand the right side:\n\n2T - 5 = 3T - 15\n\nNow, let's move all the T terms to one side and the constants to the other side. Subtract 2T from both sides:\n\n-5 = T - 15\n\nThen, add 15 to both sides:\n\n10 = T\n\nSo, Tom is 10 years old now. Since Sarah is twice as old as Tom, she must be 2 * 10 = 20 years old.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. Five years ago, Sarah would have been 20 - 5 = 15 years old, and Tom would have been 10 - 5 = 5 years old. Is it true that 15 is three times 5? Yes, 15 = 3 * 5, so it checks out.\n\nTherefore, Sarah is currently 20 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
