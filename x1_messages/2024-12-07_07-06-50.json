I am thrilled to have with us today an incredible young woman who has become a global symbol of courage and advocacy for education. Please welcome Malala Yousafzai!\n\n[Audience Applause as Malala walks onto the stage, waving and smiling. She sits down across from Oprah.]\n\nOprah: Malala, it is such an honor to have you here.\n\nMalala: Thank you so much for having me, Oprah. I'm really excited to be here.\n\nOprah: Now, let's dive right in. You've had an extraordinary journey, especially considering your age. Can you tell our audience a bit about your early life in Swat Valley, Pakistan?\n\nMalala: Sure, Oprah. I was born in the Swat Valley, which is a beautiful place in Pakistan. My father ran a school, and he always encouraged me to get an education. He believed that education was very important, not just for boys but for girls as well. So, from a young age, I was passionate about going to school and learning.\n\nOprah: And that passion led you to speak out against the Taliban's attempts to deny education to girls in your region. Can you share with us what inspired you to become such a vocal advocate at such a young age?\n\nMalala: Well, when the Taliban took over our valley, they started banning girls from going to school. They destroyed schools and threatened families who sent their daughters to learn. I couldn't understand why they wanted to take away something as basic as education. So, I started speaking up, writing blogs, and talking to journalists about the importance of education for all children, regardless of their gender.\n\nOprah: Your bravery is truly inspiring. On October 9, 2012, you were shot by the Taliban while on your way home from school. Can you describe that day and how you managed to survive such a horrific attack?\n\nMalala: That day started like any other. I was on the bus going home from school, talking with my friends. Suddenly, a masked man boarded the bus and asked for me by name. He then shot me in the left side of my head. I was lucky to survive, but the attack changed my life forever.\n\nOprah: After the attack, you were flown to the UK for medical treatment and later chose to stay there. How has life been for you since then?\n\nMalala: It's been a journey of recovery, both physically and emotionally. Living in the UK has given me new opportunities to continue my education and to spread the message about the importance of education for every child. I've met so many wonderful people and have been able to work on projects that aim to improve education access worldwide.\n\nOprah: You've become a global icon for youth activism and were even nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2014, you became the youngest-ever Nobel laureate. How does it feel to have achieved so much at such a young age?\n\nMalala: It's overwhelming, really. I never imagined that my voice could reach so many people or that I would receive such recognition. But I believe that this platform is not just for me; it's for all the children around the world who are denied their basic right to education. I feel a great responsibility to use my voice to advocate for them.\n\nOprah: You've also written a best-selling book, \"I Am Malala,\" and co-founded the Malala Fund to support girls' education. Can you tell us more about the work of the Malala Fund?\n\nMalala: Absolutely. The Malala Fund is dedicated to giving every girl an opportunity to achieve a future she chooses. We work in countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, India, and Lebanon, supporting local education advocates and investing in their efforts to create change. Our goal is to help girls complete 12 years of safe, quality education.\n\nOprah: That's amazing. Education truly is the key to so many opportunities. Now, you're studying at the University of Oxford. What are you studying, and how do you balance your academic pursuits with your activism?\n\nMalala: I'm studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE). It's a challenging course, but I find it fascinating because it helps me understand the world better and how different systems and ideologies shape societies. Balancing academics and activism can be tough, but I try to manage my time effectively and prioritize what's important.\n\nOprah: Time management must be crucial for you. Aside from your studies and activism, do you have any hobbies or interests that help you relax?\n\nMalala: Yes, I do enjoy reading, especially books on history and current affairs. I also like watching movies and spending time with my family and friends. It's important to have some downtime to recharge.\n\nOprah: Absolutely. Now, looking ahead, what are your future plans and goals?\n\nMalala: In the short term, I'm focused on completing my degree at Oxford. Long term, I hope to continue advocating for education and working towards a world where every child has access to quality education. I also dream of returning to Pakistan someday and contributing to its development.\n\nOprah: That's wonderful. Malala, you are an inspiration to millions around the world. What message would you like to share with young people who are watching today?\n\nMalala: I would say, never give up on your dreams and always stand up for what you believe in. Education is your power, and it can change not just your life, but the world around you. So, keep learning, keep growing, and never stop believing in yourself.\n\nOprah: Beautifully said, Malala. Thank you so much for being here today and for sharing your incredible story with us.\n\nMalala: Thank you, Oprah, for having me.\n\n[Audience Applause]\n\nOprah: Don't forget to check out Malala's book, \"I Am Malala,\" and learn more about the Malala Fund's work at malala.org.
