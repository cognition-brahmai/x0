        "content": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 5x + 7, we'll use the basic rules of differentiation from calculus. Don't worry if you're not fully comfortable with calculus yet; I'll walk you through it step by step.\n\nFirst, remember that the derivative of a function gives us the rate at which the function is changing at any given point. It's like finding the slope of the function at that point.\n\nThe function we have is f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 5x + 7. This is a polynomial function, and\u5e78fully, differentiating polynomials is straightforward once you know the rules.\n\nThe main rule we'll use here is the power rule. The power rule states that if you have a function in the form of x^n, where n is any real number, then the derivative is n*x^(n-1).\n\nLet's apply this to each term in our function.\n\nFirst term: 3x\u00b2\n\n- The exponent here is 2.\n\n- Applying the power rule: bring down the exponent as a coefficient, then subtract one from the exponent.\n\n- So, the derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x^(2-1) = 2x.\n\n- But we have 3 times x\u00b2, so we multiply the derivative by 3.\n\n- Therefore, the derivative of 3x\u00b2 is 3*2x = 6x.\n\nSecond term: -5x\n\n- The exponent here is 1 (since x is the same as x^1).\n\n- Applying the power rule: bring down the exponent as a coefficient, then subtract one from the exponent.\n\n- So, the derivative of x^1 is 1x^(1-1) = 1x^0 = 1*1 = 1.\n\n- But we have -5 times x, so the derivative is -5*1 = -5.\n\nThird term: 7\n\n- This is a constant term.\n\n- The derivative of any constant is zero because constants don't change.\n\nSo, now, let's put it all together.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 5x + 7 is:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 5 + 0 = 6x - 5\n\nTherefore, f'(x) = 6x - 5\n\nThat's the derivative of the function.\n\nJust to double-check, let's make sure we didn't miss anything.\n\n- We applied the power rule to each term individually.\n\n- We handled the coefficients correctly by multiplying them with the derivatives of the variable parts.\n\n- We recognized that the derivative of a constant is zero.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if you're familiar with limits, you could also find the derivative using the limit definition, but that would be more complicated for this polynomial. The power rule is sufficient and efficient here.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6x - 5} \\]"
