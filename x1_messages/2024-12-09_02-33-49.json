        "content": "Let's see here. So, there are four friends who decided to split the cost of a meal equally. The total cost was $80, so originally, each friend was supposed to pay an equal share of that total.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each friend's original share was. Since there are four friends, I can divide the total cost by four.\n\nSo, $80 divided by 4 is $20. That means each friend originally planned to pay $20.\n\nBut then, one friend realizes they forgot their wallet and can't pay. So now, only three friends are left to cover the total cost of $80.\n\nThese three friends agree to each pay an extra $5 to cover the missing share. So, each of the three friends is paying their original $20 plus an extra $5, which is $25 per friend.\n\nLet me check if that adds up to the total cost.\n\nThree friends paying $25 each would be 3 times $25, which is $75.\n\nWait, but the total cost is $80. So, $75 is $5 short of $80.\n\nBut according to the problem, each of the three friends is paying an extra $5 to cover the missing share.\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me denote the original share each friend was supposed to pay as x.\n\nSo, 4x = $80, which means x = $20, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut when one friend can't pay, the remaining three friends cover the missing share by each paying an extra $5.\n\nSo, the missing share is $20, since that's what one friend was supposed to pay.\n\nNow, this $20 is being covered by three friends, each paying an extra $5.\n\nSo, 3 friends times $5 extra each is $15.\n\nBut $15 is less than the missing $20.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me read it again.\n\n\"Four friends decide to split the cost of a meal equally.
