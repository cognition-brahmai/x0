        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. It says that a person burns about 100 calories per mile when running. They run at a pace of 6 miles per hour for 45 minutes, and I need to find out how many calories they burn. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many miles the person runs in 45 minutes at a pace of 6 miles per hour. Since speed is miles per hour, and time is in minutes, I should probably convert the time into hours to make the units compatible.\n\nSo, 45 minutes is 45/60 hours, which is 0.75 hours. Now, if they're running at 6 miles per hour for 0.75 hours, the distance they cover is speed multiplied by time. That would be 6 miles per hour times 0.75 hours, which equals 4.5 miles.\n\nOkay, so they run 4.5 miles. Now, the problem says they burn about 100 calories per mile. So, to find out the total calories burned, I can multiply the number of miles by the calories per mile.\n\nThat would be 4.5 miles times 100 calories per mile, which equals 450 calories.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. First, converting 45 minutes to hours: 45 divided by 60 is indeed 0.75 hours. Then, distance equals speed times time: 6 times 0.75 is 4.5 miles. And then, calories burned is 100 calories per mile times 4.5 miles, which is 450 calories.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to approach this problem to confirm? Maybe I can think about it in terms of calories burned per minute.\n\nIf they're running at 6 miles per hour, and burning 100 calories per mile, then I can find out how many calories they burn per minute.\n\nFirst, find out how many minutes it takes to run one mile at 6 miles per hour.\n\nSince speed is 6 miles per hour, the time per mile is 1/6 hour per mile. Convert that to minutes: 1/6 hour times 60 minutes per hour equals 10 minutes per mile.\n\nSo, they take 10 minutes to run one mile, and burn 100 calories per mile.\n\nNow, if they run for 45 minutes, and each mile takes 10 minutes, then in 45 minutes, they would run 4.5 miles, just like before.\n\nAnd again, 4.5 miles times 100 calories per mile equals 450 calories.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, I'm more confident now that 450 calories is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using rates.\n\nTheir running rate is 6 miles per hour, and calorie burn rate is 100 calories per mile.\n\nSo, the calorie burn per hour would be 6 miles per hour times 100 calories per mile, which is 600 calories per hour.\n\nNow, if they run for 45 minutes, which is 0.75 hours, then the total calories burned would be 600 calories per hour times 0.75 hours, which equals 450 calories.\n\nAgain, the same answer. This is reassuring.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe their weight or something? But the problem gives a general rate of 100 calories per mile, so I think it's okay to use that.\n\nWait, I recall that generally, calorie burn can depend on the person's weight, but since the problem provides a fixed rate, I think it's safe to use that.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that it's about running, so I don't think I need to account for different activities.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the person burns 450 calories by running at 6 miles per hour for 45 minutes, given that they burn 100 calories per mile.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]\n"
