        "content": "In the context of English Literature, the Romantic period was a time of significant literary and artistic development that spanned from the late 18th century to the early 19th century. This era was characterized by a focus on emotion, nature, and individualism, often reacting against the industrialization and rationalism of the previous periods.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. William Wordsworth: He is indeed one of the key figures of the Romantic movement in English literature. Along with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Wordsworth is credited with launching the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication \"Lyrical Ballads\" in 1798. His poetry often celebrated the beauty of nature and the simplicity of rural life, themes central to Romanticism.\n\nB. George Orwell: Orwell was a prominent writer in the 20th century, known for his dystopian novels like \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm.\" His works are more aligned with modernist and political literature rather than Romanticism.\n\nC. Arthur Miller: An American playwright, Miller is best known for plays such as \"Death of a Salesman\" and \"The Crucible.\" His works are typically associated with realism and social criticism in the mid-20th century, far from the Romantic period.\n\nD. Virginia Woolf: She was a central figure in the modernist movement in English literature, known for her innovative stream-of-consciousness narrative technique. Works like \"Mrs. Dalloway\" and \"To the Lighthouse\" are emblematic of modernism, not Romanticism.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is A. William Wordsworth, as he is renowned for his contributions to the Romantic period in English Literature."
