        "content": "So, the train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours. Now, it's going back from Town B to Town A at 40 miles per hour, and I need to find out how long that will take.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the distance between Town A and Town B. Since speed is distance divided by time, I can rearrange that to find distance by multiplying speed by time. So, distance from A to B is 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nNow, for the return trip, the train is going at 40 miles per hour, and the distance is the same, 120 miles. To find the time, I can use the formula time equals distance divided by speed. So, time from B to A is 120 miles divided by 40 miles per hour. That should be 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that when you travel the same distance at different speeds, the average speed isn't just the average of the two speeds. Maybe I should check if there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nLet me think about the average speed for the whole trip. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. But in this case, I'm only interested in the return trip time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of harmonic mean for the speeds since it's the same distance traveled at different speeds.\n\nThe formula for the average speed for a round trip is (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2). But again, I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nWait, no. I just need the time for the return trip. I already calculated the distance as 120 miles and the speed as 40 miles per hour, so time should be 120 divided by 40, which is 3 hours.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I consider the time taken for both trips. From A to B: 2 hours at 60 mph, distance 120 miles. From B to A: time unknown at 40 mph, same distance 120 miles.\n\nSo total distance is 240 miles, total time is 2 hours plus the time for the return trip, which is 120 / 40 = 3 hours. So total time is 5 hours.\n\nBut again, I only need the time for the return trip, which is 3 hours.\n\nI think that's the answer, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nI have the distance from A to B as 120 miles, and the speed on the return trip as 40 mph. So time = 120 / 40 = 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use proportions. If the train goes faster, it takes less time, and vice versa. So if it goes slower on the return trip, it should take more time than the 2 hours it took to go from A to B.\n\nSince 40 mph is two-thirds of 60 mph (because 40 / 60 = 2/3), the time should be inversely proportional. So if speed is two-thirds, time should be three-halves.\n\nWait, let's see: if speed is multiplied by a factor, time is divided by that factor for the same distance.\n\nSo, if the speed decreases to two-thirds, the time increases to three-halves.\n\nOriginal time was 2 hours, so new time is 2 * (3/2) = 3 hours.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can also think in terms of units. Miles per hour: 60 miles per hour means it covers 60 miles in one hour. So to cover 120 miles, it takes 2 hours.\n\nAt 40 miles per hour, it covers 40 miles in one hour. So to cover 120 miles, it would take 120 / 40 = 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up an equation.\n\nLet t be the time for the return trip.\n\nThen, speed * time = distance \u2192 40 * t = 120 \u2192 t = 120 / 40 = 3 hours.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion that the return trip takes 3 hours.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
