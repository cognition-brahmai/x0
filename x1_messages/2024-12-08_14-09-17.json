        "content": "In economics, elasticity measures how much the quantity demanded or supplied of a good responds to changes in one of its determinants, most commonly price. When we talk about the price elasticity of demand, we're specifically looking at how sensitive the quantity demanded is to changes in the price of the good.\n\nThe price elasticity of demand (PED) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ PED = \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\\% \\text{ change in price}} \\]\n\nBased on the value of PED, demand can be classified into different categories:\n\n1. **Perfectly Elastic Demand (PED = \u221e)**: Any small change in price leads to an infinite change in quantity demanded. The demand curve is horizontal.\n\n2. **Elastic Demand (PED > 1)**: A given percentage change in price leads to a larger percentage change in quantity demanded. Demand is considered responsive to price changes.\n\n3. **Unit Elastic Demand (PED = 1)**: A given percentage change in price leads to an equal percentage change in quantity demanded. The percentage change in quantity demanded is proportional to the percentage change in price.\n\n4. **Inelastic Demand (PED < 1)**: A given percentage change in price leads to a smaller percentage change in quantity demanded. Demand is not very responsive to price changes.\n\n5. **Perfectly Inelastic Demand (PED = 0)**: No matter how much the price changes, the quantity demanded remains the same. The demand curve is vertical.\n\nGiven this context, if a good has an elasticity of demand less than 1, it is described as having inelastic demand. This means that changes in price have a relatively small effect on the quantity demanded. Consumers are not very responsive to price changes for such goods, possibly because they are necessities or there are no close substitutes available.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Inelastic"
