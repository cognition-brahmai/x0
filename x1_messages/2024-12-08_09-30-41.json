Now, I know you're probably thinking, \"Michael, what could possibly be his favorite memory?\" Well, buckle up, because this one is a real doozy.\n\nSo, picture this: It's the summer of '85, and I'm about nine years old. My family and I are on vacation in this tiny little town in upstate New York called Honeoye. Now, Honeoye\u2014have you ever been there? It's like this idyllic lake community where everyone knows your name, and the only action is the occasional golf cart zooming by. Anyway, so we're there for a week, and every day, my cousins and I would wake up bright and early, eager to explore.\n\nOur favorite spot was this old, rickety treehouse that was perched way up high, overlooking the lake. It was like Fort Apache or something, you know? We were the rulers of that treehouse, and no one else was allowed up there unless they passed our secret handshake and password test. Can you imagine? Nine-year-olds running the CIA.\n\nSo, one particular day, we decided to have a picnic up in the treehouse. I remember my mom packed us these amazing sandwiches\u2014peanut butter and jelly, but not just any PB&J. Oh no, she used real jelly, not that fake stuff, and the bread was homemade, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Absolute perfection. And to wash it down, we had these little juice boxes, you know, the ones with the straw?\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting. So, we're up in the treehouse, eating our sandwiches, laughing, telling jokes, when all of a sudden, this huge storm rolls in. Dark clouds, lightning, thunder\u2014the works. We looked at each other, and I remember thinking, \"Oh man, maybe we should head down.\" But no, we were invincible, right? Kids think they're immune to everything.\n\nSo, we stay put, figuring the treehouse would protect us. But then, boom! A flash of lightning hits a tree right next to ours. I swear, the whole tree shook, and for a second, I thought our treehouse was going to come crashing down. My cousins and I, we froze, eyes wide open, hearts pounding.\n\nAnd then, somehow, we started laughing. I don't know why, but it was just so surreal, so funny in a terrifying way. We laughed until our bellies hurt, and then we decided it was probably a good idea to get down from the treehouse before more lightning struck.\n\nSo, we carefully made our way down, holding onto the ropes and wooden planks, trying not to look too far down. Once we were safely on the ground, my mom hugged us tight, relief written all over her face. She probably thought we were brave or something, but honestly, we were just lucky.\n\nLooking back, that was such a formative experience. It taught me that even in the face of danger, you can find humor, and that sometimes, the best memories are the ones where you laugh together, even when you're scared.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my favorite childhood memory. It's like a scene straight out of a movie, isn't it? Maybe one day, I'll write a script about it. Who knows? Michael Scott, screenwriter extraordinaire.\n\nBut for now, I'm just going to enjoy remembering that sunny yet stormy day in Honeoye, up in that treehouse, with my cousins, sharing a sandwich and a laugh. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have paper towels to fold or something.\n\n**Michael Scott, out.**\n"
