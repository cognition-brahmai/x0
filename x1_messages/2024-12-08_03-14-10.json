        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an artist who paints 7 paintings every month but only sells 2 of them each month. We need to find out how many unsold paintings he will have after a year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. An unsold painting is one that has been painted but not sold. So, each month, the artist adds 7 paintings to his collection but removes only 2 by selling them. That means the number of unsold paintings increases by the difference between the paintings painted and the paintings sold each month.\n\nLet me calculate that difference:\n\nPaintings painted per month: 7\n\nPaintings sold per month: 2\n\nUnsold paintings per month: 7 - 2 = 5\n\nSo, every month, the artist has 5 more unsold paintings.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many unsold paintings there will be after a year. Since a year has 12 months, I can multiply the monthly unsold paintings by 12.\n\nUnsold paintings per month: 5\n\nNumber of months in a year: 12\n\nTotal unsold paintings after a year: 5 * 12 = 60\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider if there's any starting point or if the unsold paintings carry over each month. The problem doesn't mention any initial number of paintings, so I'll assume he starts with zero unsold paintings.\n\nLet me verify this with a simple example. Suppose we look at the first month:\n\nMonth 1:\n\nPaintings painted: 7\n\nPaintings sold: 2\n\nUnsold paintings: 7 - 2 = 5\n\nAt the end of Month 1, he has 5 unsold paintings.\n\nMonth 2:\n\nPaintings painted: 7\n\nPaintings sold: 2\n\nUnsold paintings this month: 7 - 2 = 5\n\nTotal unsold paintings: previous unsold (5) + new unsold (5) = 10\n\nMonth 3:\n\nPaintings painted: 7\n\nPaintings sold: 2\n\nUnsold paintings this month: 7 - 2 = 5\n\nTotal unsold paintings: previous unsold (10) + new unsold (5) = 15\n\nHmm, this pattern suggests that each month, the unsold paintings increase by 5.\n\nSo, after 12 months, it would be 5 * 12 = 60.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the total paintings painted minus the total paintings sold over the year.\n\nTotal paintings painted in a year: 7 paintings/month * 12 months = 84 paintings\n\nTotal paintings sold in a year: 2 paintings/month * 12 months = 24 paintings\n\nTotal unsold paintings: 84 - 24 = 60 paintings\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the number of unsold paintings. For example, maybe some paintings take more than a month to sell, or perhaps there are months where he sells more than he paints. But based on the information given, the artist consistently paints 7 and sells 2 every month.\n\nAnother angle: if he sells only 2 paintings per month, but paints 7, it's assumed that the unsold paintings carry over to the next month. The problem doesn't suggest any limitations on storage or any paintings being discarded, so all unsold paintings accumulate over time.\n\nTherefore, after a year, the artist will have 60 unsold paintings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
