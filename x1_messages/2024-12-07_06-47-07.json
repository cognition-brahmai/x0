        "content": "So there are 120 people in a room, and we're told that 75% of them are wearing glasses, and 40% are wearing hats. We need to find the minimum number of people who could be wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many people are wearing glasses and how many are wearing hats.\n\nTotal people = 120\n\nPercentage wearing glasses = 75%\n\nSo, number of people wearing glasses = 75% of 120 = (75/100) * 120 = 90 people\n\nPercentage wearing hats = 40%\n\nNumber of people wearing hats = 40% of 120 = (40/100) * 120 = 48 people\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of people who are wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nTo find the minimum overlap between two groups, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula for the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats or both is:\n\nNumber wearing glasses + number wearing hats - number wearing both = total wearing either or both.\n\nBut in this case, we want to minimize the number wearing both.\n\nWe also know that the total number of people is 120, and some may not be wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nBut the question is about the minimum number wearing both, so we need to consider the maximum possible overlap.\n\nWait, actually, to minimize the overlap, we need to maximize the number of people who are only wearing glasses or only wearing hats, and see how many are left that have to be wearing both.\n\nSo, if we have 90 wearing glasses and 48 wearing hats, the total number wearing either or both would be less than or equal to 120.\n\nBut to minimize the number wearing both, we assume as many as possible are only wearing glasses or only wearing hats.\n\nSo, the minimum number wearing both is:\n\nNumber wearing glasses + number wearing hats - total people\n\n= 90 + 48 - 120 = 138 - 120 = 18\n\nSo, the minimum number of people wearing both glasses and hats is 18.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nIf 90 are wearing glasses and 48 are wearing hats, and only 120 people in total, then the maximum number who could be wearing only glasses is 90, and only hats is 48, but together they add up to 138, which is more than 120.\n\nTherefore, at least 138 - 120 = 18 people must be wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nSo, yes, the minimum number wearing both is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
