        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression we have is:\n\n4 * (7 - 3)^2 + 5 / (10 - 7)\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS. That stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n(7 - 3) = 4\n\nand\n\n(10 - 7) = 3\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n4 * 4^2 + 5 / 3\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nSo now it's:\n\n4 * 16 + 5 / 3\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\n4 * 16 = 64\n\nand\n\n5 / 3 \u2248 1.6667 (repeating)\n\nSo now it's:\n\n64 + 1.6667\n\nAdding those together:\n\n64 + 1.6667 = 65.6667\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 65.67.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over:\n\n4 * (7 - 3)^2 + 5 / (10 - 7)\n\nParentheses first:\n\n7 - 3 = 4\n\n10 - 7 = 3\n\nSo, 4 * 4^2 + 5 / 3\n\nExponents:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nSo, 4 * 16 + 5 / 3\n\nMultiplication and division from left to right:\n\n4 * 16 = 64\n\n5 / 3 \u2248 1.6667\n\nThen, addition:\n\n64 + 1.6667 = 65.6667\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express it as a fraction:\n\n5 / 3 is 5/3, which is approximately 1.6667.\n\nSo, 64 + 5/3\n\nTo add these, it's better to express 64 as a fraction with denominator 3:\n\n64 = 192/3\n\nSo, 192/3 + 5/3 = 197/3\n\nWhich is approximately 65.6667.\n\nSo, the exact answer is 197/3, and the decimal approximation is about 65.67.\n\nI think that's it!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65.\\overline{6}} \\]"
