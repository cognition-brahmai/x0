        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from City A to City B at 60 mph and comes back at 40 mph. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between City A and City B is D miles. That means the total distance for the round trip is 2D miles.\n\nNow, going from City A to City B at 60 mph, the time taken for that part is D divided by 60 hours.\n\nComing back from City B to City A at 40 mph, the time taken for that part is D divided by 40 hours.\n\nSo, total time is (D/60) + (D/40) hours.\n\nTo add those fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, 120 is a common multiple of 60 and 40.\n\nSo, D/60 is the same as 2D/120, and D/40 is the same as 3D/120.\n\nAdding them up, total time is (2D + 3D)/120 = 5D/120 = D/24 hours.\n\nTotal distance is 2D miles.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance divided by total time: 2D divided by (D/24).\n\nDividing by D/24 is the same as multiplying by 24/D.\n\nSo, 2D * (24/D) = 48 miles per hour.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Is there a better way to look at it?\n\nI recall that for round trips with different speeds, the average speed is not just the arithmetic mean of the two speeds. It's actually the harmonic mean, I think.\n\nThe formula for the average speed for a round trip is: average speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nPlugging in the values: (2 * 60 * 40) / (60 + 40) = (4800) / (100) = 48 mph.\n\nSo, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut let me double-check with another approach.\n\nSuppose the distance between City A and City B is 120 miles. That\u2019s a common multiple of 60 and 40, so it might make the calculations easier.\n\nGoing from A to B at 60 mph: time = 120 / 60 = 2 hours.\n\nComing back from B to A at 40 mph: time = 120 / 40 = 3 hours.\n\nTotal distance = 240 miles.\n\nTotal time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed = 240 / 5 = 48 mph.\n\nAgain, 48 mph.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I get the same answer.\n\nI think 48 mph is the correct average speed for the entire round trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
