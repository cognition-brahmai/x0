        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. We're given two pieces of information:\n\n1. 3 times the number of Type A widgets plus 2 times the number of Type B widgets equals 50.\n\n2. The total number of widgets sold is 20.\n\nFirst, I need to translate these statements into mathematical equations. Let's assign variables to the unknowns:\n\nLet \\( a \\) be the number of Type A widgets sold.\n\nLet \\( b \\) be the number of Type B widgets sold.\n\nNow, according to the first statement:\n\n\\( 3a + 2b = 50 \\)\n\nAnd according to the second statement:\n\n\\( a + b = 20 \\)\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( 3a + 2b = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( a + b = 20 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). There are a few methods to solve systems of equations, such as substitution, elimination, or graphing. I think the substitution method might be straightforward here.\n\nFirst, I can solve the second equation for one of the variables, say \\( a \\):\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n\\( a + b = 20 \\)\n\nSubtract \\( b \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( a = 20 - b \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\( 3(20 - b) + 2b = 50 \\)\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\( 60 - 3b + 2b = 50 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 60 - b = 50 \\)\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n\\( -b = -10 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\( b = 10 \\)\n\nNow that I have \\( b = 10 \\), I can substitute this back into the expression for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 20 - b = 20 - 10 = 10 \\)\n\nSo, the solution is \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 10 \\).\n\nBut wait, I should check if this solution satisfies both original equations.\n\nCheck equation 1:\n\n\\( 3a + 2b = 3(10) + 2(10) = 30 + 20 = 50 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCheck equation 2:\n\n\\( a + b = 10 + 10 = 20 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, the store sold 10 Type A widgets and 10 Type B widgets.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the elimination method. Let's see:\n\nStart with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( 3a + 2b = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( a + b = 20 \\)\n\nI can multiply equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficients of \\( b \\) the same:\n\n\\( 2(a + b) = 2(20) \\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\( 2a + 2b = 40 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this new equation from equation 1:\n\n\\( (3a + 2b) - (2a + 2b) = 50 - 40 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 3a + 2b - 2a - 2b = 10 \\)\n\nWhich reduces to:\n\n\\( a = 10 \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( a = 10 \\) back into equation 2:\n\n\\( 10 + b = 20 \\)\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\( b = 10 \\)\n\nAgain, the solution is \\( a = 10 \\), \\( b = 10 \\).\n\nSo, regardless of the method used, the answer remains the same. The store sold 10 Type A widgets and 10 Type B widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ Type A widgets and } 10 \\text{ Type B widgets}} \\]"
