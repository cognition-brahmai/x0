        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red balls and blue balls. The problem states that there are 30% more red balls than blue balls. We need to find out what percentage of the total balls in the box are blue.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what \"30% more red balls than blue balls\" means. If there are blue balls, and red balls are 30% more than that, we can express the number of red balls in terms of the number of blue balls.\n\nLet's assume the number of blue balls is B. Then, the number of red balls R would be:\n\nR = B + 0.3B\n\nR = 1.3B\n\nSo, for every blue ball, there are 1.3 red balls.\n\nNow, the total number of balls T in the box would be the sum of blue and red balls:\n\nT = B + R\n\nSubstituting R from above:\n\nT = B + 1.3B\n\nT = 2.3B\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of blue balls in the total balls. The percentage P of blue balls is:\n\nP = (B / T) * 100%\n\nSubstituting T from above:\n\nP = (B / 2.3B) * 100%\n\nThe B in numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nP = (1 / 2.3) * 100%\n\nNow, let's calculate 1 divided by 2.3:\n\n1 / 2.3 \u2248 0.4348\n\nNow, multiply by 100% to get the percentage:\n\nP \u2248 0.4348 * 100% \u2248 43.48%\n\nSo, approximately 43.48% of the balls in the box are blue.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nStarting with R = 1.3B\n\nT = B + R = B + 1.3B = 2.3B\n\nP = (B / 2.3B) * 100% = (1 / 2.3) * 100% \u2248 43.48%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider an example to verify.\n\nSuppose there are 100 blue balls (B = 100).\n\nThen, red balls R = 1.3 * 100 = 130\n\nTotal balls T = 100 + 130 = 230\n\nPercentage of blue balls P = (100 / 230) * 100% \u2248 43.48%\n\nSame result. So, it seems accurate.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of blue balls in the box is approximately 43.48%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{43.48\\%} \\]"
