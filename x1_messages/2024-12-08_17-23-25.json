A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. For example, \"racecar\" is a palindrome because it reads the same whether you read it from left to right or right to left. Another example is \"level,\" which also maintains its spelling symmetry. Palindromes can be quite fascinating and are often used in wordplay and puzzles."
