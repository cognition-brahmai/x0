        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and we're told that its length is twice its width. Also, the perimeter of the garden is 60 feet. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width of the garden.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) is the total distance around the rectangle, which is the sum of all its sides. For a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so the formula is:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times \\text{length} + 2 \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nor more simply:\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the length is twice the width. That means:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nWe also know that the perimeter is 60 feet:\n\n\\[ P = 60 \\]\n\nSo, we can substitute the expressions we have into the perimeter formula. Let's do that:\n\n\\[ 60 = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nBut since \\( l = 2w \\), we can replace \\( l \\) with \\( 2w \\):\n\n\\[ 60 = 2(2w + w) \\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 60 = 2(3w) \\]\n\n\\[ 60 = 6w \\]\n\nNow, to find \\( w \\), we divide both sides by 6:\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{60}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ w = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the width is 10 feet.\n\nNow, since the length is twice the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the garden are 20 feet in length and 10 feet in width.\n\nTo double-check, let's plug these values back into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) = 2(20 + 10) = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the given perimeter. So, our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are \\(\\boxed{20 \\text{ feet by } 10 \\text{ feet}}\\)."
