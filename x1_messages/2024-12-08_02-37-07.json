        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people sitting around a circular table, and each person shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes occur in total.\n\nFirst, I know that in a group of people, the number of handshakes can be calculated using combinations. Specifically, it's the number of ways to choose 2 people out of the total to shake hands, since a handshake involves two people.\n\nSo, for 5 people, the number of handshakes should be the combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of \\( n \\).\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there should be 10 handshakes in total.\n\nBut wait, is there anything special about the fact that they are sitting around a circular table? Does the arrangement affect the number of handshakes?\n\nI think in a circular arrangement, each person can shake hands with others, but the positions might impose some restrictions if there were limitations on who can shake hands with whom based on seating, but in this problem, it says each person shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, regardless of their seating positions.\n\nTherefore, the circular arrangement doesn't affect the total number of handshakes in this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it by considering one person. Let's say person A shakes hands with the other 4 people. Then person B shakes hands with the remaining 3 people (since they already shook hands with person A). Then person C shakes hands with the remaining 2 people, and person D shakes hands with person E.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n4 (from A) + 3 (from B) + 2 (from C) + 1 (from D) = 10\n\nThis matches the combination calculation.\n\nAnother way to visualize this is to think of the people as vertices of a complete graph, where each edge represents a handshake. In a complete graph with 5 vertices, the number of edges is also given by \\( C(5, 2) = 10 \\).\n\nTherefore, regardless of the arrangement, as long as each person shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, there will be 10 handshakes in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
