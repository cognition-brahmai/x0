        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Ruby script that reads a CSV file with employee data\u2014names, ages, and salaries\u2014and then calculates the average salary grouped by age ranges like 20-29, 30-39, and so on. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the structure of the CSV file. Assuming it's a standard CSV with headers, something like:\n\n```\nname,age,salary\nAlice,25,50000\nBob,30,60000\nCharlie,22,45000\n...\n```\n\nI need to read this file, parse the data, group employees by age ranges, and then calculate the average salary for each group.\n\nAlright, so in Ruby, handling CSV files is pretty straightforward thanks to the `csv` library. I'll need to require that at the beginning of my script.\n\nNext, I need to define the age ranges. Let's say we have 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and so on. I can define these ranges using Ruby's range functionality.\n\nI'll need to read each row, extract the age and salary, determine which age range the employee falls into, and then accumulate the salaries for that age group.\n\nAfter reading all the data, I'll calculate the average salary for each age group by dividing the total salary by the number of employees in that group.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in code. I'll probably use a hash where the keys are the age ranges and the values are arrays of salaries or perhaps a hash containing the total salary and the count.\n\nWait, using a hash with age ranges as keys and another hash containing total salary and count as values sounds efficient. That way, I can easily calculate the average by dividing total salary by count for each age group.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n```ruby\nage_groups = {\n  '20-29' => { total: 0, count: 0 },\n  '30-39' => { total: 0, count: 0 },\n  '40-49' => { total: 0, count: 0 },\n  # and so on\n}\n```\n\nThen, as I read each row, I'll determine the age group and add the salary to the corresponding total and increment the count.\n\nBut defining these age groups manually can be tedious, especially if I need to extend the ranges in the future. Maybe I can generate these age groups dynamically.\n\nFor example, I can create a method that, given an age, returns the age group string. Like:\n\n```ruby\ndef age_group(age)\n  case age\n  when 20..29 then '20-29'\n  when 30..39 then '30-39'\n  when 40..49 then '40-49'\n  # and so on\n  else 'Other'\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThen, in my main script, I can use this method to categorize each employee.\n\nWait, but in Ruby, hashes can have default values, which is perfect for this scenario. I can set the hash to have a default value of { total: 0, count: 0 }, so I don't have to predefine all possible age groups.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n```ruby\nage_groups = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = { total: 0, count: 0 } }\n```\n\nThen, for each employee, I can do:\n\n```ruby\nage_group = age_group(employee_age)\nage_groups[age_group][:total] += employee_salary\nage_groups[age_group][:count] += 1\n```\n\nAfter processing all employees, I can iterate over `age_groups` and calculate the average for each group.\n\nI also need to handle reading the CSV file. Assuming the file is named `employees.csv`, I can use `CSV.read` or `CSV.foreach` to iterate over each row.\n\nI should also handle any potential errors, like the file not existing or having invalid data.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the script:\n\n1. Require the `csv` library.\n\n2. Define the `age_group` method.\n\n3. Read the CSV file using `CSV.foreach`.\n\n4. For each row, extract age and salary, determine the age group, and accumulate the total and count in the `age_groups` hash.\n\n5. After processing all rows, calculate and print the average salary for each age group.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like empty files, missing age or salary data, or ages that don't fit into the predefined groups.\n\nMaybe I should add some input validation to handle these cases gracefully.\n\nAdditionally, I can make the age grouping more flexible. For example, instead of hardcoding the age ranges, I can define a range size and generate the age groups dynamically based on the minimum and maximum ages in the dataset.\n\nBut for now, to keep it simple, I'll stick with predefined age ranges.\n\nLet me think about how to handle the salary data. Assuming salaries are integers or floats, but to keep it simple, I'll assume they're integers.\n\nI need to make sure that the salary is parsed correctly from the CSV file.\n\nAlso, when calculating the average, I should handle the case where there are no employees in a particular age group to avoid division by zero.\n\nI'll need to check if the count is greater than zero before calculating the average.\n\nMoreover, I can sort the age groups before printing the results to make it more organized.\n\nPerhaps sort them in ascending order based on the age group.\n\nLastly, I should consider how to handle ages that don't fit into the predefined groups. For example, ages below 20 or above a certain range. I can either exclude them or group them into an 'Other' category.\n\nFor now, I'll include an 'Other' category for ages that don't fit into the standard groups.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Let me start writing some code.\n\nFirst, require the CSV library:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'csv'\n```\n\nDefine the `age_group` method:\n\n```ruby\ndef age_group(age)\n  case age\n  when 20..29 then '20-29'\n  when 30..39 then '30-39'\n  when 40..49 then '40-49'\n  when 50..59 then '50-59'\n  else 'Other'\n  end\nend\n```\n\nInitialize the age_groups hash with default values:\n\n```ruby\nage_groups = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = { total: 0, count: 0 } }\n```\n\nRead the CSV file:\n\n```ruby\nCSV.foreach('employees.csv', headers: true) do |row|\n  age = row['age'].to_i\n  salary = row['salary'].to_i\n  group = age_group(age)\n  age_groups[group][:total] += salary\n  age_groups[group][:count] += 1\nend\n```\n\nAfter processing, calculate and print the averages:\n\n```ruby\nage_groups.sort_by { |group, _| group }.each do |group, data|\n  average = data[:count] > 0 ? data[:total].to_f / data[:count] : 0\n  puts \"#{group}: #{average}\"\nend\n```\n\nThat seems pretty straightforward. But I should add some error handling.\n\nFor example, check if the file exists before trying to read it.\n\nI can use `File.exist?` for that.\n\nAlso, handle cases where age or salary are not valid integers.\n\nMaybe skip rows with invalid data.\n\nLet me add those checks.\n\nFirst, check if the file exists:\n\n```ruby\nif File.exist?('employees.csv')\n  CSV.foreach('employees.csv', headers: true) do |row|\n    age = row['age']\n    salary = row['salary']\n    next if age.nil? || salary.nil?\n\n    begin\n      age = Integer(age)\n      salary = Integer(salary)\n    rescue ArgumentError\n      next\n    end\n\n    group = age_group(age)\n    age_groups[group][:total] += salary\n    age_groups[group][:count] += 1\n  end\nelse\n  puts \"File not found: employees.csv\"\n  exit\nend\n```\n\nThis way, I skip any rows where age or salary are not valid integers.\n\nAlso, I'm assuming that ages and salaries are positive integers. If there are negative values, I might want to handle them as invalid, but for now, I'll accept them as valid.\n\nAdditionally, I can add some output formatting for the averages, like rounding to two decimal places.\n\nUse `sprintf` or `String#%` for that.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ruby\nage_groups.sort_by { |group, _| group }.each do |group, data|\n  average = data[:count] > 0 ? (data[:total].to_f / data[:count]).round(2) : 0\n  puts \"#{group}: #{average}\"\nend\n```\n\nThat should give me the average salaries formatted to two decimal places.\n\nI can also add a total count and average for all employees, if needed.\n\nBut for this task, I think grouping by age ranges and calculating the average salary for each group is sufficient.\n\nLet me think about whether there's any way to optimize this.\n\nWell, since we're reading the file line by line with `CSV.foreach`, it's already memory-efficient, as we're not loading the entire file into memory.\n\nAlso, using a hash to accumulate totals and counts is efficient in terms of time complexity.\n\nI think this is a solid approach.\n\nMaybe I can make the age grouping more flexible by defining the range size and generating the age groups dynamically.\n\nBut for now, keeping it simple with predefined age ranges is fine.\n\nIf I were to make it more dynamic, I could do something like:\n\nDefine the range size and generate age groups based on the minimum and maximum ages.\n\nBut that might be overkill for this scenario.\n\nAlright, I think I'm ready to write the complete script.\n\nLet me summarize the steps:\n\n1. Require the `csv` library.\n\n2. Define the `age_group` method to categorize ages into predefined ranges.\n\n3. Initialize a hash to accumulate total salaries and counts for each age group.\n\n4. Check if the CSV file exists.\n\n5. Read the CSV file line by line, extracting age and salary, categorizing into age groups, and accumulating totals and counts.\n\n6. Skip rows with invalid age or salary data.\n\n7. After processing, calculate and print the average salary for each age group, sorted by age group.\n\n8. Format the averages to two decimal places.\n\nI can also add some comments to the code for clarity.\n\nLet me write the complete script accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to read a CSV file containing employee data (name, age, salary), group the employees by age ranges, and calculate the average salary for each group.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading the CSV File**: We use Ruby's `csv` library to read the file, assuming it has headers for name, age, and salary.\n2. **Age Grouping**: Define a method to categorize ages into predefined ranges (e.g., 20-29, 30-39).\n3. **Data Accumulation**: Use a hash to accumulate the total salaries and count of employees in each age group.\n4. **Error Handling**: Skip rows with invalid age or salary data to ensure smooth processing.\n5. **Calculating Averages**: After processing all employees, calculate the average salary for each age group and print the results.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'csv'\n\n# Method to determine the age group based on the given age\ndef age_group(age)\n  case age\n  when 20..29 then '20-29'\n  when 30..39 then '30-39'\n  when 40..49 then '40-49'\n  when 50..59 then '50-59'\n  else 'Other'\n  end\nend\n\n# Initialize a hash to accumulate total salaries and counts for each age group\nage_groups = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = { total: 0, count: 0 } }\n\n# Check if the file exists\nif File.exist?('employees.csv')\n  CSV.foreach('employees.csv', headers: true) do |row|\n    age = row['age']\n    salary = row['salary']\n    next if age.nil? || salary.nil?\n\n    begin\n      age = Integer(age)\n      salary = Integer(salary)\n    rescue ArgumentError\n      next\n    end\n\n    group = age_group(age)\n    age_groups[group][:total] += salary\n    age_groups[group][:count] += 1\n  end\nelse\n  puts \"File not found: employees.csv\"\n  exit\nend\n\n# Calculate and print the average salary for each age group\nage_groups.sort_by { |group, _| group }.each do |group, data|\n  average = data[:count] > 0 ? (data[:total].to_f / data[:count]).round(2) : 0\n  puts \"#{group}: #{average}\"\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading the CSV File**: We use `CSV.foreach` to read the file line by line, which is memory efficient.\n2. **Age Grouping**: The `age_group` method categorizes ages into predefined ranges using `case` statements.\n3. **Data Accumulation**: A hash `age_groups` is used to keep track of the total salaries and the number of employees in each age group.\n4. **Error Handling**: We skip any rows where age or salary data is missing or invalid (non-integer values).\n5. **Calculating Averages**: After processing all employees, we calculate the average salary for each age group and print the results in a sorted order.\n\nThis approach ensures that the script is robust, efficient, and easy to understand."
