        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 students in the classroom, and each one shakes hands with every other student exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about one student. If there are 20 students, then one student would shake hands with 19 other students, right? Because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nBut if I multiply 20 by 19, that would be 380 handshakes, but that seems too high. And I realize that if student A shakes hands with student B, that's the same as student B shaking hands with student A. So, in my initial calculation, I'm counting each handshake twice.\n\nTherefore, to get the total number of unique handshakes, I need to divide that 380 by 2.\n\nSo, 380 divided by 2 is 190.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to think about this? Maybe using combinations.\n\nYes, in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 20 to shake hands is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of students, and k is the number of students involved in each handshake, which is 2.\n\nSo, C(20, 2) = 20! / (2!(20 - 2)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 18!) = (20 \u00d7 19) / 2 = 380 / 2 = 190.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can look for a pattern with smaller numbers.\n\nLet's say there are 2 students: A and B.\n\nThey shake hands once. So, total handshakes: 1.\n\nNow, 3 students: A, B, C.\n\nA shakes with B and C (2 handshakes), B shakes with C (1 handshake), total: 3.\n\nFor 4 students: A, B, C, D.\n\nA shakes with B, C, D (3 handshakes), B shakes with C, D (2 handshakes), C shakes with D (1 handshake), total: 6.\n\nSo, for 2 students: 1 handshake.\n\n3 students: 3 handshakes.\n\n4 students: 6 handshakes.\n\nI notice that these are triangular numbers.\n\n1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, etc.\n\nSo, for 20 students, following this pattern, the number of handshakes would be the 19th triangular number.\n\nWait, why the 19th? Because for 2 students, it's the first triangular number, 3 students is the second, 4 students is the third, so 20 students would be the 19th.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the nth triangular number: T(n) = n(n + 1)/2.\n\nSo, T(19) = 19 \u00d7 20 / 2 = 190.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nIs there yet another way to look at this?\n\nPerhaps using graph theory. If each student is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge, then this is equivalent to finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 20 vertices.\n\nIn graph theory, the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is given by C(n, 2), which is n(n - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 20, it's 20 \u00d7 19 / 2 = 190.\n\nOnce more, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think it's safe to conclude that the total number of handshakes is 190.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's try to see if there's any possibility of overlapping handshakes or some other factor I might have missed.\n\nGiven that each handshake is unique and occurs only once between two students, and there are no restrictions beyond that, I don't think there are any overlapping handshakes to consider.\n\nAlso, since the problem specifies that each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once, there are no repeated handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the total number should indeed be 190.\n\nJust to double-check, I can try calculating C(20, 2) again:\n\nC(20, 2) = (20 \u00d7 19) / 2 = 380 / 2 = 190.\n\nYes, that's consistent across multiple methods: basic arithmetic, combinatorics, and graph theory.\n\nSo, the final answer is 190 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
