        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if it takes 6 workers 8 hours to build a wall, how long would it take 12 workers to build the same wall, assuming all workers work at the same pace?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a problem about work and how the number of workers affects the time needed to complete a task. The key assumption here is that all workers work at the same pace, which means each worker contributes equally to the work done.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. If 6 workers take 8 hours to build the wall, then the total amount of work done can be thought of as \"worker-hours.\" So, the total work required to build the wall is 6 workers multiplied by 8 hours, which is 48 worker-hours.\n\nNow, if I have 12 workers instead of 6, and they're all working at the same pace, the total work required still remains 48 worker-hours. But since there are more workers, the time required should be less.\n\nTo find out how long it would take for 12 workers to complete the same amount of work, I can set up an equation. Let's let \\( t \\) be the time in hours that 12 workers need to build the wall.\n\nSo, the total work done by 12 workers in \\( t \\) hours would be \\( 12 \\times t \\) worker-hours. This should equal the total work required, which is 48 worker-hours.\n\nTherefore, I can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times t = 48 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{48}{12} \\]\n\n\\[ t = 4 \\]\n\nSo, it would take 12 workers 4 hours to build the same wall.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If 6 workers take 8 hours, and 12 is double the number of workers, then intuitively, the time should be halved, which aligns with my calculation: 8 hours divided by 2 is 4 hours.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the work rate per worker. If 6 workers take 8 hours to build the wall, then the work rate for the group is \\( \\frac{1 \\text{ wall}}{8 \\text{ hours}} \\). So, the work rate per worker would be \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of that, which is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{48} \\) walls per hour per worker.\n\nNow, if I have 12 workers, their combined work rate would be \\( 12 \\times \\frac{1}{48} = \\frac{12}{48} = \\frac{1}{4} \\) walls per hour.\n\nTo build one wall, the time required would be \\( \\frac{1 \\text{ wall}}{\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ walls per hour}} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors to consider. The problem states that all workers work at the same pace, so there are no variations in work rates among workers. Also, it assumes that adding more workers doesn't affect productivity in any other way, like coordination issues or space constraints. In reality, there might be limits to how many workers can effectively work on the same task simultaneously, but based on the problem's assumptions, we can ignore those factors.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it would take 12 workers 4 hours to build the same wall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
