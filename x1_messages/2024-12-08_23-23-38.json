        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (4 * 3) / 2 + 5^2 - 8.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses: (4 * 3). That's 12. So now the expression is 12 / 2 + 5^2 - 8.\n\nNext, exponents: 5^2 is 25. Now the expression is 12 / 2 + 25 - 8.\n\nThen, multiplication and division from left to right. Here, we have 12 / 2, which is 6. So now it's 6 + 25 - 8.\n\nFinally, addition and subtraction from left to right: 6 + 25 is 31, and 31 - 8 is 23.\n\nSo, the answer should be 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]"
