        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a rectangle has an area of 120 square inches and a length of 15 inches. I need to find out what its width is. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. That makes sense. So, in this case, I have the area and the length, and I need to find the width.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width\n\nI have:\n\nArea = 120 square inches\n\nLength = 15 inches\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n120 = 15 \u00d7 Width\n\nNow, I need to solve for width. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 15. That should isolate the width on one side.\n\nSo:\n\nWidth = 120 \u00f7 15\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n15 goes into 120 how many times? Well, 15 times 8 is 120.\n\nSo, Width = 8 inches\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the length is 15 inches and the width is 8 inches, then the area should be 15 \u00d7 8 = 120 square inches. Yeah, that matches the given area.\n\nAlright, so the width is 8 inches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using formulas or different methods.\n\nAnother way is to use the formula for the area of a rectangle and rearrange it to solve for width. So, starting with Area = Length \u00d7 Width, I can rearrange this to Width = Area \u00f7 Length.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nWidth = 120 \u00f7 15 = 8 inches\n\nSame answer. Good.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the relationship between length and width in terms of ratios or something, but that seems unnecessary for this straightforward problem.\n\nI should also consider units. The area is in square inches, and the length is in inches, so the width should also be in inches, which it is.\n\nIs there any other aspect to this problem? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nLet's see: is the rectangle a special type of rectangle, like a square? Well, if it were a square, the length and width would be equal, but here the length is 15 inches and the width is 8 inches, which are different, so it's just a regular rectangle.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the measurements make sense. A rectangle with these dimensions should have an area of 120 square inches, which it does.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The width is 8 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
