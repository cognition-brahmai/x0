        "content": "Certainly! Converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius is a common task, and Python makes it straightforward to accomplish. The formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is:\n\n\\[ C = (F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9} \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the temperature in Celsius and \\( F \\) is the temperature in Fahrenheit.\n\nI'll walk you through how to create a Python function to perform this conversion. We'll also consider some best practices for writing clean and reusable code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius in Python, you can use the following function:\n\n```python\ndef fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):\n    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9\n    return celsius\n```\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Formula Application**: The function uses the standard conversion formula from Fahrenheit to Celsius: \\( C = (F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9} \\).\n2. **Simplicity**: The function is designed to be simple and straightforward, taking one parameter (the temperature in Fahrenheit) and returning the converted temperature in Celsius.\n3. **Reusability**: By\u5c01\u88c5 this conversion logic into a function, it can be easily reused in larger programs whenever temperature conversion is needed.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Function Definition**: The function is defined with one parameter, `fahrenheit`, which represents the temperature in Fahrenheit that needs to be converted.\n- **Conversion Calculation**: Inside the function, the Celsius temperature is calculated using the formula mentioned above.\n- **Return Statement**: The calculated Celsius temperature is returned as the result of the function.\n\nThis function provides a clear and efficient way to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius in Python."
