These are often used to transition between different directions in the dance.\n\n- Add turns: Once comfortable with the basic steps, incorporate turns by using the cross-body lead or other turn patterns. Remember to signal turns clearly to your partner.\n\n- Practice with music: Dance to salsa music, focusing on matching your steps to the rhythm and beat. Start with slower songs and gradually increase the tempo as you become more comfortable.\n\n## Final Answer\n- **Start with the basic stance:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight on the balls of your feet.\n\n- **Master the timing:** Salsa music typically has a 4/4 time signature, and the basic step is counted as \"1-2-3, 5-6-7\" or \"quick-quick-slow, quick-quick-slow.\"\n\n- **Learn the forward and backward basic steps:** Forwards, step forward with your left foot on count \"1,\" replace weight to your right foot on \"2,\" and step back with your left foot on \"3.\" Then, step back with your right foot on \"5,\" replace weight to your left foot on \"6,\" and step forward with your right foot on \"7.\" Reverse the feet for moving backward.\n\n- **Incorporate side steps:** Side steps involve stepping to the side with one foot and then bringing the other foot beside it.
