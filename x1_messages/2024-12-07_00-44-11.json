        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a school where 60% of students play football, 30% play basketball, and 10% play both games. We need to find out what percentage of students don't play any game.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how many students play at least one of the games. That would be the total percentage of students who play football or basketball, considering that some play both.\n\nI recall that in set theory, when we want to find the union of two sets, we add the individual percentages and then subtract the intersection to avoid double-counting those who play both games.\n\nSo, the formula for the union of two sets A and B is:\n\n\\[ \\text{A} \\cup \\text{B} = \\text{A} + \\text{B} - \\text{A} \\cap \\text{B} \\]\n\nIn this case:\n\n- A is the set of students who play football (60%).\n\n- B is the set of students who play basketball (30%).\n\n- A \u2229 B is the set of students who play both (10%).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Students who play football or basketball} = 60\\% + 30\\% - 10\\% = 80\\% \\]\n\nSo, 80% of students play at least one of the two games.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of students who don't play any game, I think I need to subtract this number from 100%, because the total percentage must add up to 100%.\n\n\\[ \\text{Students who play no games} = 100\\% - 80\\% = 20\\% \\]\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 60% play football and 30% play basketball, and 10% play both, then indeed, the total who play at least one game is 80%. Therefore, the remaining 20% must not be playing any game.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using a Venn diagram would help visualize it.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents football players (60%), and the other represents basketball players (30%). The overlap is 10%, which are students who play both.\n\nSo, the part of the football circle that doesn't overlap is 60% - 10% = 50%. The part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap is 30% - 10% = 20%. Then, the overlap is 10%.\n\nAdding these up: 50% (only football) + 20% (only basketball) + 10% (both) = 80%.\n\nAgain, subtracting from 100% gives 20% who play no games.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Is there a possibility that some students play other games not mentioned here? The question only talks about football and basketball, so I think it's safe to assume that the only games considered are these two.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students who do not play any game should be 20%.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of students playing only one game being counted incorrectly.\n\nIf 50% play only football, 20% play only basketball, and 10% play both, that adds up to 80%, leaving 20% who play neither.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
