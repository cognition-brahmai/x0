I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can check if Python is installed by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your command line. If it's not installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n\nOnce you have Python installed, you can create a new Python file for your calculator. Let's name it `calculator.py`. You can create this file using any text editor, such as Notepad, VSCode, or Sublime Text.\n\nNow, open `calculator.py` in your text editor and we'll start writing the code.\n\n### Step 1: Define the operations\n\nWe need to define functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function will take two numbers as input and return the result of the respective operation.\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n    return x / y\n```\n\n### Step 2: Get user input\n\nWe need to get input from the user, which includes the operation they want to perform and the numbers they want to operate on.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Select operation:\")\nprint(\"1. Add\")\nprint(\"2. Subtract\")\nprint(\"3. Multiply\")\nprint(\"4. Divide\")\n\nchoice = input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n```\n\n### Step 3: Perform the calculation\n\nBased on the user's choice, we will call the appropriate function and display the result.\n\n```python\nif choice == '1':\n    print(\"Result: \", add(num1, num2))\nelif choice == '2':\n    print(\"Result: \", subtract(num1, num2))\nelif choice == '3':\n    print(\"Result: \", multiply(num1, num2))\nelif choice == '4':\n    print(\"Result: \", divide(num1, num2))\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid input\")\n```\n\n### Step 4: Put it all together\n\nNow, combine all the parts into a single script.\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n    return x / y\n\nprint(\"Select operation:\")\nprint(\"1. Add\")\nprint(\"2. Subtract\")\nprint(\"3. Multiply\")\nprint(\"4. Divide\")\n\nchoice = input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\nif choice == '1':\n    print(\"Result: \", add(num1, num2))\nelif choice == '2':\n    print(\"Result: \", subtract(num1, num2))\nelif choice == '3':\n    print(\"Result: \", multiply(num1, num2))\nelif choice == '4':\n    print(\"Result: \", divide(num1, num2))\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid input\")\n```\n\n### Step 5: Run the calculator\n\nSave the file and open your command line. Navigate to the directory where you saved `calculator.py` and run it by typing `python calculator.py` or `python3 calculator.py`, depending on your Python installation.\n\nYou should see the operation options, and you can enter your choice and the numbers to perform the calculation.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple command-line calculator in Python. You can further enhance it by adding more features, such as handling more operations or improving the user interface.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
