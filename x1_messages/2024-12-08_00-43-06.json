        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car rental company with 50 cars in their fleet. Each car is rented for an average of 20 days per month, and they charge $60 per day for each car. We need to find out their monthly revenue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what revenue means. Revenue is the total income generated from providing a service or selling a product before any costs or expenses are deducted. In this case, it's the total money earned from renting out the cars.\n\nSo, to find the monthly revenue, I should calculate the total number of days all cars are rented in a month and then multiply that by the daily rental rate.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Number of cars: 50\n\n2. Average rental days per car per month: 20\n\n3. Daily rental rate: $60\n\nFirst, find the total rental days for all cars in a month:\n\nTotal rental days = Number of cars \u00d7 Average rental days per car\n\nTotal rental days = 50 cars \u00d7 20 days/car = 1000 days\n\nNow, calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total rental days by the daily rate:\n\nRevenue = Total rental days \u00d7 Daily rate\n\nRevenue = 1000 days \u00d7 $60/day = $60,000\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nIf each car is rented for 20 days, and there are 50 cars, then indeed, the total rental days are 1000 days. Multiplying that by $60 per day gives $60,000.\n\nBut, is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the revenue per car per month and then multiply by the number of cars.\n\nRevenue per car per month = Average rental days per car \u00d7 Daily rate\n\nRevenue per car per month = 20 days \u00d7 $60/day = $1,200\n\nThen, total revenue for all cars:\n\nTotal revenue = Revenue per car \u00d7 Number of cars\n\nTotal revenue = $1,200/car \u00d7 50 cars = $60,000\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way could be to think about the total possible rental days if all cars are rented out for the entire month. But since it's an average of 20 days, and not necessarily all cars are rented out all the time, the approach I took seems correct.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other factors that could affect the revenue, like discounts or additional fees, but based on the information provided, it's just the basic rental charge.\n\nSo, the monthly revenue for the car rental company is $60,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60000} \\]"
