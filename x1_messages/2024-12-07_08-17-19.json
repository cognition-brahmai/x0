        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a jar with 5 red marbles, 7 green marbles, and 8 blue marbles. That totals up to 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 marbles. We're drawing two marbles without replacement, and we want to find the probability that both marbles are the same color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to draw two marbles without replacement. It means that once I draw the first marble, it doesn't go back into the jar, so the total number of marbles decreases by one for the second draw.\n\nThe probability that both marbles are the same color can be broken down into three separate cases: both are red, both are green, or both are blue. We can calculate the probability for each case and then add them together to get the total probability.\n\nLet's start with the red marbles. There are 5 red marbles out of 20 total marbles. The probability of drawing a red marble first is 5/20. After drawing one red marble, there are now 4 red marbles left and a total of 19 marbles. So, the probability of drawing a second red marble is 4/19. Therefore, the probability of both marbles being red is (5/20) * (4/19).\n\nNext, for the green marbles. There are 7 green marbles out of 20 total marbles. The probability of drawing a green marble first is 7/20. After drawing one green marble, there are now 6 green marbles left and a total of 19 marbles. So, the probability of drawing a second green marble is 6/19. Therefore, the probability of both marbles being green is (7/20) * (6/19).\n\nFinally, for the blue marbles. There are 8 blue marbles out of 20 total marbles. The probability of drawing a blue marble first is 8/20. After drawing one blue marble, there are now 7 blue marbles left and a total of 19 marbles. So, the probability of drawing a second blue marble is 7/19. Therefore, the probability of both marbles being blue is (8/20) * (7/19).\n\nNow, we add up these three probabilities to get the total probability that both marbles are the same color.\n\nLet me calculate each one:\n\nRed: (5/20) * (4/19) = (1/4) * (4/19) = 1/19\n\nGreen: (7/20) * (6/19) = (7/20) * (6/19) = (42)/(380) = 21/190\n\nBlue: (8/20) * (7/19) = (2/5) * (7/19) = (14)/(95)\n\nNow, to add these up: 1/19 + 21/190 + 14/95\n\nFirst, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 19, 190, and 95. The least common multiple of these is 190.\n\nSo, convert each fraction to have a denominator of 190.\n\n1/19 = 10/190\n\n21/190 stays the same.\n\n14/95 = 28/190\n\nNow, add them up: 10/190 + 21/190 + 28/190 = 59/190\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles are the same color is 59/190.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that addition: 10 + 21 is 31, plus 28 is 59. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 59/190.\n\nAlternatively, we can check if this fraction can be simplified. The greatest common divisor of 59 and 190 is 1, since 59 is a prime number and doesn't divide into 190. So, 59/190 is already in its simplest form.\n\nThere's another way to approach this problem, which is to use combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 marbles out of 20 is C(20,2), which is 190. The number of ways to draw 2 red marbles is C(5,2) = 10, 2 green marbles is C(7,2) = 21, and 2 blue marbles is C(8,2) = 28. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 + 21 + 28 = 59. Therefore, the probability is 59/190, which matches our previous result.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider the overall probability formula for drawing two marbles of the same color.\n\nThe probability is given by:\n\nP(same color) = P(both red) + P(both green) + P(both blue)\n\nWe've calculated each of these probabilities and added them up to get 59/190.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the probability of drawing two marbles of different colors and subtract that from 1 to get the probability of both being the same color. But since the problem asks for both marbles to be the same color, and we've calculated it directly, I think our answer is correct.\n\nOne more thing to consider: whether the marbles are drawn without replacement affects the probabilities, which we've already accounted for by adjusting the denominators for the second draw.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 59/190 is the correct probability that both marbles drawn are the same color.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{59}{190}} \\]"
