In French, that's indeed called \"fait accompli,\" which directly translates to \"accomplished fact\" in English. It's a term often used in politics and diplomacy to describe a situation where one party takes action and presents the other party with a situation on the ground that is difficult or impossible to reverse. So, when you say it's impossible to alter things, it's akin to accepting a fait accompli."
