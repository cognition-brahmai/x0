        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 30 meters long and 15 meters wide. I need to figure out how many posts I'll need if I place them 5 meters apart around the entire garden. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the perimeter of the garden because the fence is going around the entire garden. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). So, plugging in the values, P = 2*(30 + 15) = 2*(45) = 90 meters. So, the total perimeter is 90 meters.\n\nNow, if I'm placing posts every 5 meters, I can find out the number of posts by dividing the perimeter by the distance between posts. So, 90 meters / 5 meters per post = 18 posts.\n\nWait a minute, but in fencing, you usually need a post at each corner. In a rectangular garden, there are four corners. So, if I just divide the perimeter by the distance between posts, I might be missing something because the starting and ending posts might be the same if I go all around the garden.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Let's consider one side of the rectangle. The length is 30 meters, and posts are every 5 meters. So, along the length, the number of posts would be 30 / 5 = 6 posts. But wait, that's for one side. Similarly, for the width, which is 15 meters, the number of posts would be 15 / 5 = 3 posts per width side.\n\nNow, for the entire rectangle, I have two lengths and two widths. So, total posts would be 2*(6) + 2*(3) = 12 + 6 = 18 posts. But again, this doesn't account for the corner posts being shared between two sides.\n\nActually, in fencing, the corner posts are shared by both sides. So, if I calculate posts for each side separately and add them up, I'll be double-counting the corner posts. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me calculate the number of posts along one length and one width, and then multiply by two since there are two of each.\n\nSo, for one length and one width, the distance is 30 + 15 = 45 meters. Number of posts for 45 meters at 5 meters apart would be 45 / 5 = 9 posts. But since this is for one length and one width, and there are two such pairs, total posts would be 2*9 = 18 posts.\n\nBut again, this includes the corner posts being counted in both the length and the width. So, I need to subtract the overlapping corner posts.\n\nIn a rectangle, there are four corners, so four posts are being double-counted. Therefore, I should subtract four from the total.\n\nSo, 18 - 4 = 14 posts.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. If I have two lengths and two widths, and each corner post is shared by two sides, then I should subtract the four corner posts from the total.\n\nLet me visualize this. Let's say I have the four corners: A, B, C, D, where A is the starting point.\n\n- Along the first length (A to B): 6 posts (including A and B).\n\n- Along the first width (B to C): 3 posts (including B and C).\n\n- Along the second length (C to D): 6 posts (including C and D).\n\n- Along the second width (D to A): 3 posts (including D and A).\n\nTotal posts without adjustment: 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 18 posts.\n\nBut posts A, B, C, D are counted twice because they are at the corners.\n\nSo, to avoid double-counting, I need to subtract the four corner posts.\n\nTherefore, total posts needed: 18 - 4 = 14 posts.\n\nBut wait, let's check this with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the fence as a closed loop. The number of posts in a closed loop is equal to the perimeter divided by the distance between posts.\n\nSo, P = 90 meters, distance between posts = 5 meters.\n\nNumber of posts = P / distance = 90 / 5 = 18 posts.\n\nHowever, in a closed loop, the starting and ending posts are the same, so perhaps I need to consider that.\n\nWait, actually, in a closed loop, the number of posts is equal to the number of intervals between posts, which is the perimeter divided by the distance between posts.\n\nSo, in this case, 90 / 5 = 18 posts.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the rectangle sides separately, I got 14 posts.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's consider the fence as a sequence of posts placed every 5 meters around the perimeter.\n\nStart at point A, place post 1.\n\nMove 5 meters to post 2.\n\nContinue until I return to point A.\n\nThe perimeter is 90 meters, and posts are every 5 meters.\n\nSo, the number of intervals is 90 / 5 = 18 intervals.\n\nSince it's a closed loop, the number of posts should be equal to the number of intervals, which is 18.\n\nBut earlier, when accounting for corner posts, I got 14 posts.\n\nThis suggests I made a mistake in the earlier approach.\n\nLet me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the first approach, I calculated posts along each side and then subtracted the corner posts.\n\nBut perhaps I shouldn't have subtracted the corner posts because they are necessary to connect the sides.\n\nWait, actually, corner posts are needed to turn the corner, so they must be included.\n\nMaybe the mistake was in subtracting the corner posts.\n\nLet me try a different method.\n\nLet's calculate the number of posts along the length and width, including the corners, without double-counting.\n\nFor the lengths: two lengths, each with 6 posts, but the corner posts are shared.\n\nSo, total posts for lengths: 6 + 6 - 2 = 10 posts (subtracting the two corner posts that are shared).\n\nFor the widths: two widths, each with 3 posts, again subtracting the corner posts.\n\nTotal posts for widths: 3 + 3 - 2 = 4 posts.\n\nTotal posts: 10 + 4 = 14 posts.\n\nBut this matches my earlier calculation of 14 posts, which contradicts the closed loop calculation of 18 posts.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nImagine starting at corner A and placing post 1.\n\nThen every 5 meters, place another post.\n\nAround the perimeter:\n\n- A to B: 30 meters, which is 6 posts (including A and B).\n\n- B to C: 15 meters, which is 3 posts (including B and C).\n\n- C to D: 30 meters, 6 posts (including C and D).\n\n- D to A: 15 meters, 3 posts (including D and A).\n\nTotal posts: 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 18 posts.\n\nBut in this count, posts A, B, C, D are counted twice.\n\nSo, to correct for double-counting, subtract the four corner posts.\n\nTotal posts: 18 - 4 = 14 posts.\n\nBut according to the closed loop method, it should be 18 posts.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the starting post is counted again at the end.\n\nIn a closed loop, the starting post is the same as the ending post.\n\nSo, in this case, if I start at post 1 at corner A, and place posts every 5 meters, when I return to A, I would have already placed post 18 there.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique posts is 18.\n\nBut according to the earlier method, it's 14 posts.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests a mistake in the earlier approach.\n\nPerhaps the error is in assuming that subtracting the four corner posts from the total gives the correct number of unique posts.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that each corner post is shared by two sides, so in the total count of posts along all sides, the corner posts are counted twice.\n\nTherefore, to get the unique number of posts, I need to subtract the number of corner posts from the total count.\n\nSo, total posts without adjustment: 6 (length) + 3 (width) + 6 (length) + 3 (width) = 18 posts.\n\nSince there are four corners, and each corner post is counted twice, I need to subtract 4 to get the unique number of posts.\n\nThus, 18 - 4 = 14 posts.\n\nBut this contradicts the closed loop calculation, which suggests 18 posts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a closed loop, the starting post is not subtracted again at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that posts are placed every 5 meters without considering that the last post coincides with the first post.\n\nLet me calculate the number of intervals and posts in a closed loop.\n\nIn a closed loop, the number of posts is equal to the number of intervals between posts.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 90 meters and posts are every 5 meters, the number of intervals is 90 / 5 = 18 intervals.\n\nTherefore, the number of posts is also 18.\n\nHowever, in the earlier method, I got 14 posts, which is inconsistent.\n\nThis suggests that the method of calculating posts along each side and subtracting corner posts is flawed.\n\nPerhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that along each side, the number of posts is equal to the length of the side divided by the distance between posts, plus one for the starting post.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the number of posts along a side is (length of side) / (distance between posts) + 1.\n\nBut in the case of a closed loop, the starting and ending posts are the same, so the last post on one side is the first post on the next side.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nFor the length (30 meters):\n\nNumber of posts = 30 / 5 + 1 = 7 posts.\n\nWait, but 30 / 5 = 6 intervals, so 7 posts.\n\nSimilarly, for the width (15 meters):\n\nNumber of posts = 15 / 5 + 1 = 4 posts.\n\nNow, for the entire rectangle:\n\nTwo lengths: 2 * 7 = 14 posts.\n\nTwo widths: 2 * 4 = 8 posts.\n\nTotal posts if not a closed loop: 14 + 8 = 22 posts.\n\nBut since it's a closed loop, the starting and ending posts are the same, so we need to subtract the overlapping posts.\n\nIn a rectangle, the corners are where the sides meet, and the post at the corner is shared by both sides.\n\nSo, for each corner, one post is shared by two sides.\n\nThere are four corners, so four posts are shared.\n\nTherefore, total unique posts = total posts without adjustment - number of shared posts = 22 - 4 = 18 posts.\n\nAh, now this matches the closed loop calculation of 18 posts.\n\nEarlier, I think I misapplied the method by subtracting four from 18 to get 14, but actually, I should be subtracting the overlapping posts correctly.\n\nWait, in this case, total posts without adjustment is 22, and subtracting the four shared corner posts gives 18 posts, which matches the closed loop calculation.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 18 posts.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a closed loop, the number of posts is equal to the perimeter divided by the distance between posts.\n\nP = 90 meters, distance = 5 meters, so number of posts = 90 / 5 = 18 posts.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of posts needed is 18.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arose from miscounting the number of posts along each side.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Perimeter = 2*(length + width) = 2*(30 + 15) = 90 meters.\n\n- Number of posts = perimeter / distance between posts = 90 / 5 = 18 posts.\n\nThus, the answer is 18 posts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
