        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 40 students. According to the problem, 60% passed the math exam, and 75% passed the English exam. Also, every student passed at least one of the exams. We need to find the minimum number of students who passed both exams.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students passed each exam.\n\nFor math:\n\n60% of 40 students passed math.\n\nSo, number of students who passed math = 60/100 * 40 = 24 students.\n\nFor English:\n\n75% of 40 students passed English.\n\nSo, number of students who passed English = 75/100 * 40 = 30 students.\n\nNow, since every student passed at least one of the exams, the total number of students who passed either math or English or both should be equal to the total number of students, which is 40.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who passed both exams.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that:\n\nNumber of students who passed math or English = Number who passed math + Number who passed English - Number who passed both.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\nn(M \u222a E) = n(M) + n(E) - n(M \u2229 E)\n\nWe know that n(M \u222a E) = 40, n(M) = 24, n(E) = 30.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n40 = 24 + 30 - n(M \u2229 E)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n40 = 54 - n(M \u2229 E)\n\nNow, solving for n(M \u2229 E):\n\nn(M \u2229 E) = 54 - 40 = 14\n\nSo, 14 students passed both exams.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimum number of students who passed both exams. Is 14 the minimum?\n\nWait a minute, let's think about this. The principle of inclusion-exclusion gives us the exact number of students who passed both exams based on the given percentages and the total number of students.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that every student passed at least one exam, which means there are no students who failed both exams.\n\nGiven that, the calculation above should give us the exact number, not just the minimum.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to interpret this differently to find a minimum.\n\nLet me consider that some students could have passed only math, only English, or both.\n\nWe have 24 students who passed math and 30 who passed English.\n\nIf we add those up, we get 24 + 30 = 54, but there are only 40 students in total.\n\nThe overlap, or students who passed both, would be 54 - 40 = 14, as we calculated earlier.\n\nIs there a way to have fewer than 14 students passing both exams?\n\nLet's suppose we try to minimize the number of students who passed both exams.\n\nWhat if we have as many students as possible passing only one exam?\n\nBut given the numbers, 24 passed math and 30 passed English, the total exceeds the class size.\n\nSo, the overlap must be at least 24 + 30 - 40 = 14.\n\nI don't see a way to have fewer than 14 students passing both exams.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of students who passed both exams is 14.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if some students could have passed only math or only English, but given the constraints, it seems 14 is the minimum overlap.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Only math: M only\n\n- Only English: E only\n\n- Both: B\n\nWe know that:\n\nM only + B = 24 (students who passed math)\n\nE only + B = 30 (students who passed English)\n\nAnd total students: M only + E only + B = 40\n\nWe need to find the minimum B.\n\nFrom the first two equations, we can express M only and E only in terms of B:\n\nM only = 24 - B\n\nE only = 30 - B\n\nPlugging these into the total students equation:\n\n(24 - B) + (30 - B) + B = 40\n\nSimplify:\n\n24 - B + 30 - B + B = 40\n\n54 - B = 40\n\nSo, B = 54 - 40 = 14\n\nAgain, we get B = 14.\n\nIt seems that 14 is the only solution, not just the minimum.\n\nPerhaps the problem is trying to test the understanding of the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the percentages.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal students = 40\n\n60% passed math: 0.6 * 40 = 24\n\n75% passed English: 0.75 * 40 = 30\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nn(M \u222a E) = n(M) + n(E) - n(M \u2229 E)\n\n40 = 24 + 30 - n(M \u2229 E)\n\nn(M \u2229 E) = 54 - 40 = 14\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that some students could have passed both exams, but I don't see how to get a number lower than 14.\n\nWait, maybe if some students passed both exams, and others passed only one, but the numbers still add up to 40.\n\nBut according to the inclusion-exclusion principle, 14 is the exact number.\n\nI think the minimum number of students who passed both exams is 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
