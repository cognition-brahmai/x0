        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where 70% of the men are married to 90% of the women. We need to find the minimum percentage of the population that is married. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what's being asked. We need to find the smallest possible percentage of the total population that is married, given these constraints.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let M be the number of men in the town.\n\n- Let W be the number of women in the town.\n\n- So, the total population is M + W.\n\nNow, 70% of the men are married. That means 0.7M men are married.\n\nSimilarly, 90% of the women are married, which means 0.9W women are married.\n\nBut here's the thing: in a marriage, one man is married to one woman. So, the number of married men should equal the number of married women, right? Because each marriage involves one man and one woman.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"70% of the men are married to 90% of the women.\" Does that mean that each married man is married to one married woman, and vice versa?\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the number of married men should be equal to the number of married women.\n\nSo, 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nFrom this equation, we can express M in terms of W:\n\n0.7M = 0.9W \u21d2 M = (0.9/0.7)W = (9/7)W.\n\nOkay, so M = (9/7)W.\n\nNow, the total population is M + W = (9/7)W + W = (16/7)W.\n\nNow, the total number of married people is the number of married men plus the number of married women, which is 0.7M + 0.9W.\n\nBut since 0.7M = 0.9W, we can say that the total number of married people is 0.7M + 0.7M = 1.4M, or 1.8W, whichever is convenient.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Since 0.7M = 0.9W, then the total number of married people is 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7M + 0.7M = 1.4M.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because 0.7M = 0.9W, so 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7M + 0.7M = 1.4M, but that doesn't make sense because 0.9W is equal to 0.7M, so adding them gives 0.7M + 0.7M = 1.4M.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let's see:\n\nWe have 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nSo, 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7M + 0.7M = 1.4M.\n\nWait, but 0.9W is equal to 0.7M, so yes, 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7M + 0.7M = 1.4M.\n\nAlternatively, 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7M + 0.7M = 1.4M.\n\nWait, but I feel like there's a better way to express this.\n\nLet me try expressing everything in terms of W.\n\nWe have M = (9/7)W.\n\nSo, number of married men: 0.7M = 0.7*(9/7)W = (6.3/7)W = (63/70)W = (9/10)W.\n\nNumber of married women: 0.9W.\n\nSo, total married people: (9/10)W + 0.9W = (9/10)W + (9/10)W = (18/10)W = 1.8W.\n\nTotal population: M + W = (9/7)W + W = (16/7)W.\n\nSo, the percentage of married people is (1.8W) / (16/7)W * 100%.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(1.8 / (16/7)) * 100% = (1.8 * 7 / 16) * 100% = (12.6 / 16) * 100% = 0.7875 * 100% = 78.75%.\n\nSo, the percentage is 78.75%.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimum percentage. Is there a way to make it less than this?\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that some people might be married to people outside the town, but the problem says \"married to,\" so I think all marriages are within the town.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"70% of the men are married to 90% of the women,\" which implies that the marriages are between town residents.\n\nWait, but perhaps there are some married couples where both partners are from the town, and some where only one is from the town.\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that the marriages are between town residents.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of married men might not equal the number of married women if there are people married to outsiders.\n\nBut the problem says \"married to,\" which suggests that the marriages are between town residents.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that some women are married to men from outside the town.\n\nBut the problem says \"70% of the men are married to 90% of the women,\" which implies that the 70% of men are married to the 90% of women all within the town.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the number of marriages.\n\nEach marriage involves one man and one woman.\n\nSo, the number of marriages is equal to the number of married men, which is 0.7M, and also equal to the number of married women, which is 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nSo, M = (9/7)W.\n\nTotal population is M + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTotal married people is 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7*(9/7)W + 0.9W = (63/70)W + (63/70)W = (126/70)W = 1.8W.\n\nSo, percentage married is (1.8W) / (16/7)W * 100% = (1.8 * 7 / 16) * 100% = (12.6 / 16) * 100% = 78.75%.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimum percentage.\n\nIs there a way to have a smaller percentage married?\n\nWait, maybe if some people are married to multiple partners.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any polygamy, so I think we have to assume monogamy.\n\nWait, but perhaps there are some people who are married to each other, and some who are not.\n\nWait, no, the problem seems to suggest straightforward marriages within the town.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a way to interpret the problem such that not all married women are married to town men, but that seems contrary to the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the town has more women than men, but according to M = (9/7)W, M is larger than W.\n\nWait, according to M = (9/7)W, M is larger than W, since 9/7 > 1.\n\nWait, but in reality, the sex ratio might not be exactly equal, but for this problem, we have to go with the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some women are married to each other, or some men are married to each other, but the problem seems to assume heterosexual marriages.\n\nBut perhaps in this town, there are same-sex marriages as well.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that all marriages are between one man and one woman.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more marriages than just the 70% of men and 90% of women.\n\nWait, no, the problem says 70% of men are married to 90% of women, which implies that those are the only marriages.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, the problem says \"70% of the men are married to 90% of the women.\"\n\nDoes that mean that those are the only marriages in the town, or that within the marriages, 70% of men are married to 90% of women?\n\nI think it's the former.\n\nSo, perhaps there are other marriages involving the remaining 30% of men and 10% of women.\n\nBut that would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be interpreted as all marriages being between 70% of men and 90% of women.\n\nBut that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some women are married to more than one man.\n\nBut again, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are men who are married to multiple women.\n\nBut again, that seems unlikely, and probably against the assumption of monogamy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some men are married to women outside the town.\n\nBut then, those women wouldn't be included in the 90% of women in the town who are married.\n\nWait, the problem says \"70% of the men are married to 90% of the women.\"\n\nSo, it seems that the 70% of men are married to the 90% of women, all within the town.\n\nTherefore, the number of marriages is equal to the number of married men, which is 0.7M, and also equal to the number of married women, which is 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nSo, M = (9/7)W.\n\nTotal population is M + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTotal married people is 0.7M + 0.9W = 0.7*(9/7)W + 0.9W = (63/70)W + (63/70)W = (126/70)W = 1.8W.\n\nPercentage married is (1.8W)/(16/7)W * 100% = (1.8*7)/16 * 100% = 12.6/16 * 100% = 78.75%.\n\nSo, the answer is 78.75%.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the minimum percentage.\n\nIs there a way to have a smaller percentage married?\n\nWait, perhaps if some people are married multiple times, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if some men are married to women outside the town, then the number of married men could be more than the number of married women in the town.\n\nBut the problem says \"married to 90% of the women,\" which suggests that all married men are married to town women.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that some men are married to multiple women, so the number of married men could be less than the number of married women.\n\nBut in monogamous marriages, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some women are married to men outside the town, which would mean that the number of married women could be more than the number of married men in the town.\n\nBut the problem says \"70% of the men are married to 90% of the women,\" which suggests that the 70% of men are married to the 90% of women all within the town.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent interpretation is that the number of married men equals the number of married women, which is 0.7M = 0.9W.\n\nTherefore, M = (9/7)W.\n\nTotal population is M + W = (16/7)W.\n\nTotal married people is 0.7M + 0.9W = 1.8W.\n\nTherefore, percentage married is (1.8W)/((16/7)W) * 100% = (1.8*7)/16 * 100% = 12.6/16 * 100% = 78.75%.\n\nSo, the answer is 78.75%.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the minimum percentage.\n\nIs there a way to have a smaller percentage?\n\nWait, perhaps if some women are married to each other or some men are married to each other, but the problem seems to assume heterosexual marriages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if some people are married multiple times, but again, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if some men are married to multiple women, but in monogamous marriages, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if some women are married to men outside the town, then the number of married women could be more than the number of married men in the town.\n\nBut then, the number of married men would be less than 0.9W, which contradicts the earlier equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if some men are married to women outside the town, then the number of married men could be more than the number of married women in the town.\n\nBut again, that seems to contradict the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for a scenario where not all marriages are within the town.\n\nBut the problem says \"70% of the men are married to 90% of the women,\" which seems to imply that these marriages are all within the town.\n\nTherefore, the earlier calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimum percentage of the population that is married is 78.75%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78.75\\%} \\]"
