        "content": "Sure! To create a Python program that fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sign up for an API key**: First, you need to sign up on the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) website and obtain an API key.\n\n2. **Install necessary libraries**: You'll need the `requests` library to make HTTP requests. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n3. **Write the Python code**: Create a script that takes a city name as input, makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, parses the JSON response, and displays the relevant weather information.\n\nHere's a sample Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city_name, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        'q': city_name,\n        'appid': api_key,\n        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        main = data['main']\n        weather = data['weather'][0]\n        \n        temperature = main['temp']\n        humidity = main['humidity']\n        description = weather['description']\n        \n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Weather Description: {description.capitalize()}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"City not found or unable to retrieve weather data.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    city_name = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    api_key = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    get_weather(city_name, api_key)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **API Key**: Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with the actual API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.\n\n2. **Base URL**: The base URL for the OpenWeatherMap current weather data API.\n\n3. **Parameters**:\n   - `q`: City name.\n   - `appid`: Your API key.\n   - `units`: Use `'metric'` for Celsius or `'imperial'` for Fahrenheit.\n\n4. **Making the Request**: Use the `requests.get` method to make a GET request to the API with the specified parameters.\n\n5. **Parsing the Response**:\n   - If the response status code is 200 (OK), parse the JSON data to extract temperature, humidity, and weather description.\n   - Print the extracted information.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: If the city is not found or there is an issue with the request, print an appropriate message.\n\nThis program will prompt the user to enter a city name, fetch the current weather data for that city using the OpenWeatherMap API, and display the temperature, humidity, and weather description."
