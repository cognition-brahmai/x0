        "content": "So I've got this logic puzzle here. It seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I get it right. Let's see:\n\nThere are two people, Alice and Bob, and in this town, everyone is either a truth-teller or a liar. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, and liars always lie. Alice makes a statement: \"At least one of us is a liar.\" And I need to figure out if Bob is a liar based on that.\n\nFirst, I should probably consider the possible scenarios. There are four combinations for Alice and Bob:\n\n1. Both are truth-tellers.\n\n2. Both are liars.\n\n3. Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar.\n\n4. Alice is a liar and Bob is a truth-teller.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since there are only two types of people, and two people, there are only three possible combinations:\n\n1. Both are truth-tellers.\n\n2. Both are liars.\n\n3. One is a truth-teller and the other is a liar.\n\nBut actually, considering the roles are assigned to Alice and Bob, it's four possibilities as I initially thought.\n\nLet me try to analyze each case.\n\n**Case 1: Both are truth-tellers.**\n\nIf both are truth-tellers, then Alice's statement \"At least one of us is a liar\" would be false because neither is a liar. But truth-tellers always tell the truth, so Alice couldn't make a false statement. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\n**Case 2: Both are liars.**\n\nIf both are liars, then Alice's statement \"At least one of us is a liar\" would be true because at least one of them (in fact, both) is a liar. But liars always lie, so Alice would not make a true statement. This is another contradiction. Therefore, this case is also impossible.\n\n**Case 3: Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar.**\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar, then Alice's statement \"At least one of us is a liar\" is true, which aligns with Alice being a truth-teller. This seems consistent.\n\n**Case 4: Alice is a liar and Bob is a truth-teller.**\n\nIf Alice is a liar and Bob is a truth-teller, then Alice's statement \"At least one of us is a liar\" would be true because Alice is a liar. However, since Alice is a liar, she would not make a true statement. This is a contradiction, so this case is impossible.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Case 3 is possible, where Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet's consider Alice's statement: \"At least one of us is a liar.\"\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, then the statement is true, which means that at least one of them is a liar. Since Alice is a truth-teller, Bob must be the liar.\n\nIf Alice is a liar, then the statement is false, which means that it is not the case that at least one of them is a liar, meaning both are truth-tellers. But if Alice is a liar, that contradicts the conclusion that both are truth-tellers.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar.\n\nSo, the answer is that Bob is a liar.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way. Suppose Bob is a truth-teller. Then, if Alice says \"At least one of us is a liar,\" and Bob is a truth-teller, then for Alice's statement to be true, Alice would have to be a liar. But if Alice is a liar, her statement is false, which would mean that neither is a liar, contradicting the assumption that Alice is a liar. Therefore, Bob cannot be a truth-teller.\n\nTherefore, Bob must be a liar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bob is a liar.}} \\]"
