Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nYahooSearch[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the Yahoo search engine. This tool is useful in finding an appropriate list of sites that may or may not include the answer to the user's question. The function doesn't directly answer the question; it finds a list of sites that may have the answer.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkFinder[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAIQA[input]: Artificial Intelligence Question Answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the car, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function just just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., AIQA[What is the capital of New York, given :evidence3:?]\n\nBe sure to only include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the first person to walk on the moon and when did this happen?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who the first person to walk on the moon was and when it happened. I think the best way to start is by doing a web search to get some initial information. I can use the YahooSearch tool for that.\n\nSo, first step:\n\nPlan: Search for \"first person to walk on the moon\" to find relevant sources.\n\n:evidence0: = YahooSearch[\"first person to walk on the moon\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to look through the list of sites that YahooSearch provides and find the ones that seem most reliable and relevant. Maybe look for sites like NASA's official website or well-known news outlets.\n\nPlan: Scan the search results in :evidence0: and select the top few links that look reliable.\n\nAssuming I have these links, I should then use the WebScraper tool to extract the content from these sites so I can read through them and find the information I need.\n\nPlan: Use WebScraper to extract information from the selected links.\n\n:evidence1: = WebScraper[link1, link2, link3]\n\nNow, with the text from these sites, I need to find the answer to the question. It should be straightforward since it's a well-known fact, but I want to make sure I get it right.\n\nPlan: Read through :evidence1: to find the name of the first person to walk on the moon and the date it occurred.\n\nI can probably just look for keywords like \"first moon landing,\" \"Apollo 11,\" \"Neil Armstrong,\" and \"July 1969.\"\n\nOnce I've found the relevant information, I can confirm the details and make sure they match across different sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nPlan: Verify the information across multiple sources in :evidence1:.\n\nFinally, I can formulate the answer based on the information I've gathered.\n\nPlan: Compile the confirmed information into a concise answer.\n\n:evidence2: = AIQA[\"Who was the first person to walk on the moon and when did this happen, given :evidence1:?\"]\n\nAnd that should give me the answer I need.\n\nAnswer: :evidence2:\n\n**Final Solution**\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine who the first person to walk on the moon was and when this historic event took place. We will achieve this by leveraging available tools to conduct research and extract relevant information.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Search for Information:**\n   - Use the `YahooSearch` tool to find relevant websites that discuss the first person to walk on the moon.\n\n2. **Extract Content:**\n   - Use the `WebScraper` tool to extract information from the top reliable websites obtained from the search results.\n\n3. **Find Relevant Links:**\n   - Use the `HyperlinkFinder` tool to extract any additional links from the scraped content for further investigation if necessary.\n\n4. **Answer the Question:**\n   - Use the `AIQA` tool to parse the extracted information and directly answer the question based on the data obtained.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\nPlan: Search for \"first person to walk on the moon\" to find relevant sources.\n:evidence0: = YahooSearch[\"first person to walk on the moon\"]\n\nPlan: Scan the search results in :evidence0: and select the top few links that look reliable.\n\nPlan: Use WebScraper to extract information from the selected links.\n:evidence1: = WebScraper[link1, link2, link3]\n\nPlan: Read through :evidence1: to find the name of the first person to walk on the moon and the date it occurred.\n\nPlan: Verify the information across multiple sources in :evidence1:.\n\nPlan: Compile the confirmed information into a concise answer.\n:evidence2: = AIQA[\"Who was the first person to walk on the moon and when did this happen, given :evidence1:?\"]\n\nAnswer: :evidence2:\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **YahooSearch Tool:**\n   - This tool is used to perform a web search for the query \"first person to walk on the moon\". It returns a list of relevant websites that may contain the answer to our question.\n\n2. **WebScraper Tool:**\n   - This tool extracts the plain text content from the websites obtained from the search results. This content is then used to find the specific information we need.\n\n3. **HyperlinkFinder Tool:**\n   - Although not directly used in this plan, this tool can be utilized to extract additional links from the scraped content for more in-depth research if necessary.\n\n4. **AIQA Tool:**\n   - This tool processes the extracted information and answers the question based on the data provided. It ensures that the answer is accurate and directly addresses the user's query.\n\nBy following these steps, we can efficiently and accurately determine who the first person to walk on the moon was and when this event occurred."
