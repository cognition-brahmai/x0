        "content": "So I've got this problem here about figuring out how many workers an electronics manufacturer needs to hire for their new factory. The goal is to produce 100,000 units per month, and each unit takes 1 hour of labor to assemble. The workers will be working 8-hour shifts, 5 days a week. Also, there's a 10% absenteeism rate that I need to account for due to things like sick leave and vacations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total labor hours required per month to produce those 100,000 units. Since each unit needs 1 hour of labor, that means we need 100,000 hours of labor per month.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many hours each worker can contribute per month. To do that, I need to know how many days they work in a month and how many hours they work each day.\n\nAssuming a standard month has about 4 weeks, and they work 5 days a week, that would be 4 weeks * 5 days/week = 20 days/month.\n\nEach day, they work 8-hour shifts, so each worker can work 20 days/month * 8 hours/day = 160 hours/month.\n\nBut, there's a 10% absenteeism rate. That means that on average, each worker is only available 90% of the time. So, their effective monthly hours would be 160 hours * 90% = 144 hours/month per worker.\n\nNow, to find out how many workers are needed to meet the 100,000 hours of labor, I can divide the total required hours by the effective hours per worker.\n\nNumber of workers = Total labor hours required / Effective hours per worker\n\nNumber of workers = 100,000 hours / 144 hours/worker \u2248 694.44 workers.\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a worker, you'll need to round up to the next whole number. So, they would need to hire 695 workers to meet the production target.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, days per month: 4 weeks * 5 days/week = 20 days/month. That seems okay.\n\nHours per month per worker: 20 days * 8 hours/day = 160 hours.\n\nAccounting for 10% absenteeism: 160 hours * 90% = 144 hours/worker/month.\n\nTotal workers needed: 100,000 hours / 144 hours/worker \u2248 694.44 workers.\n\nRounding up to 695 workers.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should consider how many days are in a month more accurately. Some months have more days than others. Assuming a 30-day month, and with 5-day workweeks, it might not be exactly 20 days.\n\nLet me calculate the number of workdays in a month more accurately.\n\nIf a month has 30 days, and they work 5 days a week, then:\n\nNumber of weeks in a month = 30 days / 7 days/week \u2248 4.2857 weeks.\n\nSo, number of workdays = 4.2857 weeks * 5 days/week \u2248 21.4286 days.\n\nRounding to 21 workdays per month.\n\nSo, hours per month per worker: 21 days * 8 hours/day = 168 hours.\n\nAccounting for 10% absenteeism: 168 hours * 90% = 151.2 hours/worker/month.\n\nThen, number of workers needed: 100,000 hours / 151.2 hours/worker \u2248 661.38 workers.\n\nRounding up to 662 workers.\n\nHmm, that's quite a difference from my previous calculation of 695 workers.\n\nWhich one is more accurate?\n\nLet me see, assuming a 30-day month, with 5-day workweeks, 4.2857 weeks per month, and thus approximately 21 workdays.\n\nThat seems more accurate than assuming exactly 20 days.\n\nSo, with 21 workdays, 8 hours/day, that's 168 hours per month per worker before absenteeism.\n\nThen, with 10% absenteeism, it's 151.2 hours per month per worker.\n\nSo, 100,000 hours / 151.2 hours/worker \u2248 661.38 workers.\n\nRounding up, 662 workers.\n\nBut, perhaps I should consider the average number of workdays in a month more precisely.\n\nOn average, a month has about 20.69 workdays (52 weeks/year * 5 workdays/week / 12 months/year \u2248 20.83 days/month).\n\nBut, considering holidays and other non-working days, it might be less.\n\nFor simplicity, assuming 21 workdays per month seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate based on hours per year and then divide by months.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nAssuming 52 weeks in a year, with 5 working days per week, that's 52 * 5 = 260 workdays/year.\n\nWith 8 hours per day, that's 260 * 8 = 2,080 hours/year per worker.\n\nAccounting for 10% absenteeism: 2,080 hours * 90% = 1,872 hours/year per worker.\n\nNow, to find hours per month, assuming 12 months in a year: 1,872 hours/year / 12 months/year = 156 hours/month per worker.\n\nThen, number of workers needed: 100,000 hours / 156 hours/worker \u2248 641.02 workers.\n\nRounding up to 642 workers.\n\nWait, now I get a different number again.\n\nThis suggests that the number varies depending on how I calculate the number of workdays per month.\n\nMaybe I should consider that months have different numbers of days.\n\nSome months have 31 days, some have 30, February has 28 or 29.\n\nTo account for this variability, perhaps I should calculate based on annual hours and then prorate accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the average number of workdays per month.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, the average number of workdays per month is about 20.83 days.\n\nSo, 20.83 days/month * 8 hours/day = 166.64 hours/month per worker.\n\nAccounting for 10% absenteeism: 166.64 * 90% \u2248 150 hours/month per worker.\n\nThen, number of workers needed: 100,000 hours / 150 hours/worker \u2248 666.67 workers.\n\nRounding up to 667 workers.\n\nThis is close to my earlier calculation assuming 21 workdays per month.\n\nSo, perhaps 667 workers is a more accurate estimate.\n\nBut, to be on the safe side, maybe they should hire a few extra workers to account for any miscalculations or unexpected increases in absenteeism.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that some months have more workdays than others and adjust accordingly.\n\nFor example, in a 31-day month, there would be about 22 workdays (assuming 4.43 weeks: 4.43 * 5 = 22.15 days).\n\nIn a 30-day month: 21.08 workdays.\n\nIn a 28-day month: 20 workdays.\n\nSo, the number of workdays per month can vary between 20 and 22 days.\n\nTaking an average of 21 days seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, with 21 days * 8 hours = 168 hours per month per worker.\n\nAfter 10% absenteeism: 168 * 0.9 = 151.2 hours per month per worker.\n\nThus, number of workers needed: 100,000 / 151.2 \u2248 661.38.\n\nRounding up to 662 workers.\n\nI think this is a solid calculation.\n\nHowever, in practice, management might want to hire a few extra workers to account for variations in absenteeism rates or changes in production needs.\n\nAlso, it's possible that not all workers are of equal productivity; some may be faster or slower than others.\n\nAdditionally, there might be training periods or learning curves for new hires that could affect overall productivity.\n\nFurthermore, there could be equipment downtime, quality control issues, or other factors that reduce effective production time.\n\nTherefore, to build in some buffer, the company might consider hiring slightly more than the calculated 662 workers.\n\nFor example, they could hire 680 workers to account for these variables.\n\nAlternatively, they could implement overtime or adjust work schedules to meet production targets without hiring additional workers.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the turnover rate.\n\nIf the company expects a certain percentage of workers to leave and be replaced throughout the year, they might need to hire extra workers to account for the time it takes to train new employees.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify any of these additional constraints, I'll stick with the base calculation.\n\nSo, based on the given parameters, the company needs to hire approximately 662 workers to meet the production target of 100,000 units per month, each requiring 1 hour of labor, with workers working 8-hour shifts, 5 days a week, and accounting for a 10% absenteeism rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{662} \\]"
