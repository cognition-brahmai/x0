        "content": "So the farmer has a garden that's rectangular, right? And he wants to put a fence around it. The garden is 100 feet long and 75 feet wide. To find out how much fencing material he needs, I think he has to calculate the perimeter of the garden.\n\nI remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula should be something like perimeter equals two times the length plus two times the width.\n\nSo, in this case, it would be:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 100 feet + 2 \u00d7 75 feet\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n2 \u00d7 100 is 200 feet, and 2 \u00d7 75 is 150 feet. So, total perimeter is 200 + 150, which is 350 feet.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to purchase 350 feet of fencing material.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to calculate it. I've heard of the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle being perimeter equals twice the length plus width. Let me check that.\n\nSo, perimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 2 \u00d7 (100 + 75) = 2 \u00d7 175 = 350 feet.\n\nOkay, same answer. So, yeah, he needs 350 feet of fencing.\n\nNow, just to be sure, maybe I should consider if there's any waste or extra fencing material he might need to account for. Like, maybe fencing material comes in certain lengths, and he has to buy whole units.\n\nBut the question just asks how much fencing material he needs to purchase, so probably just the perimeter is sufficient.\n\nAlso, he might need to consider posts for the fence, but since the question is about the fencing material, I think 350 feet is the answer.\n\nOne more thing: if the fence has gates or any openings, he might need less fencing material. But the question doesn't mention any gates, so I'll assume the entire perimeter is fenced.\n\nSo, final answer: 350 feet of fencing material.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{350} \\]"
