The question is, how many beds are there on the first floor?\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the number of beds on just the first floor. Since every floor is the same, I can probably just calculate for one floor and that would be the answer.\n\nFirst, there are 4 apartments on the first floor. Each apartment has 3 rooms. So, the total number of rooms on the first floor would be 4 apartments multiplied by 3 rooms per apartment. That should be 4 * 3 = 12 rooms.\n\nNow, each room has 2 beds. So, if there are 12 rooms, and each has 2 beds, then the total number of beds on the first floor would be 12 * 2 = 24 beds.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing? Let me double-check. The building has 5 floors, but I'm only interested in the first floor. So, I don't need to consider the other floors for this calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the total number of beds in the whole building, I would multiply the number of beds on one floor by the number of floors. But since the question is only about the first floor, 24 beds should be the answer.\n\nLet me just make sure. 4 apartments per floor, 3 rooms per apartment, 2 beds per room. So, for one floor: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 beds.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
