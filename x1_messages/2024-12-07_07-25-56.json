        "content": "Alright, I've got this integral to solve: \u222b(3x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) dx. Now, I know that integration is basically the reverse process of differentiation, and it's used to find the area under a curve or to find the accumulation of a quantity. In this case, I need to find the indefinite integral of the function 3x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 with respect to x. That means I'll be getting a general antiderivative, and I should remember to add the constant of integration at the end.\n\nSo, the integral is \u222b(3x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) dx. The first thing I notice is that this is a polynomial, and integrating polynomials is straightforward because I can integrate each term separately. This property is called the linearity of integration. So, I can break it down into three separate integrals:\n\n\u222b(3x\u00b2) dx - \u222b(2x) dx + \u222b(1) dx\n\nNow, I can factor out the constants from each integral because constants can be pulled out of the integral sign:\n\n3\u222bx\u00b2 dx - 2\u222bx dx + \u222b1 dx\n\nGreat, now I need to integrate each of these terms individually.\n\nStarting with the first one: \u222bx\u00b2 dx\n\nI recall that the integral of x^n dx is (x^{n+1})/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and n \u2260 -1. In this case, n = 2, so:\n\n\u222bx\u00b2 dx = (x^{3})/3 + C\u2081\n\nNext, the second term: \u222bx dx\n\nHere, n = 1, so applying the same rule:\n\n\u222bx dx = (x^{2})/2 + C\u2082\n\nAnd finally, the third term: \u222b1 dx\n\nWell, 1 can be thought of as x^0, so n = 0. Using the same formula:\n\n\u222bx^0 dx = (x^{1})/1 + C\u2083 = x + C\u2083\n\nAlternatively, I know that the integral of a constant is just that constant times x, plus a constant of integration, which is the same thing.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n3*(x\u00b3)/3 - 2*(x\u00b2)/2 + x + C\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n3*(x\u00b3)/3 = x\u00b3\n\n-2*(x\u00b2)/2 = -x\u00b2\n\nPlus x remains x\n\nAnd then I have the constant of integration. Notice that I had C\u2081, C\u2082, and C\u2083 from each integral, but since they're all arbitrary constants, I can combine them into a single constant C.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b3 - x\u00b2 + x + C\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. When I multiplied 3*(x\u00b3)/3, that indeed gives x\u00b3. Similarly, -2*(x\u00b2)/2 is -x\u00b2, and \u222b1 dx is x + C. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of 3x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 with respect to x is x\u00b3 - x\u00b2 + x + C.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can differentiate this result to see if I get back the original function. That's a good way to check the accuracy of an integral.\n\nSo, d/dx (x\u00b3 - x\u00b2 + x + C) = 3x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 + 0 = 3x\u00b2 - 2x + 1, which matches the integrand. Perfect, that confirms my answer is correct.\n\nOne more thing: since this is an indefinite integral, the constant C can be any real number, and it represents the family of all possible antiderivatives of the function.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. The final answer is x\u00b3 - x\u00b2 + x + C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x^3 - x^2 + x + C} \\]"
