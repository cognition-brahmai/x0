        "content": "To determine the number of games played in a single-elimination rock-paper-scissors tournament with every person on Earth participating, we need to consider the structure of such a tournament.\n\nIn a single-elimination tournament, each game results in one player being eliminated, and the tournament continues until only one champion remains. The total number of games played is equal to the number of players minus one, because each game eliminates one player, and we need to eliminate all but one player to determine the winner.\n\nAs of now, the world population is approximately 7.9 billion people. So, if every person on Earth participated in this tournament, the number of games required would be:\n\nNumber of games = Number of players - 1 = 7,900,000,000 - 1 = 7,899,999,999 games.\n\nSo, roughly 7.9 billion games would need to be played to determine the single winner in a single-elimination rock-paper-scissors tournament involving the entire world population.\n\nIt's worth noting that organizing such a tournament would be logistically challenging, to say the least, given the sheer number of participants and the time it would take to complete all the games. But mathematically, the number of games required is simply one less than the number of participants.\n"
