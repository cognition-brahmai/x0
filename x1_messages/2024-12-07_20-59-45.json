        "content": "In the still of the night, when the moon is full and bright,\nA shadowy figure lurks, in the pale moonlight.\nWith eyes that burn like embers, in a face so white,\nIt whispers secrets old, in the dead of night.\n\nBeneath the ancient willow, where the roots entwine,\nA cryptic message lies, in letters that align.\nFour words etched in stone, by a hand unknown,\nGuide the seeker true, to a treasure overthrown.\n\nBut beware the traveler, who treads this path so thin,\nFor shadows hold secrets, that can drive you mad within.\nThe first word speaks of time, in cycles ever turning,\nThe second of a heart, that once loved and yearning.\n\nThe third is of a key, that opens doors unseen,\nAnd the fourth, a name, that was once held in esteem.\nCombine them well, and the way shall be clear,\nTo a prize long forgotten, beyond compare and peer.\n\nYet, should you falter, and the words misplace,\nThe shadows will claim you, in their cold, dark embrace.\nSo ponder well, and let your mind take flight,\nIn the realm of Poe, where darkness reigns bright."
