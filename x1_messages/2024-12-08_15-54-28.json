        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 20 houses, and each house has at least one cat. The total number of cats in the village is 50. We need to find out the minimum number of houses that have more than one cat.\n\nFirst, since every house has at least one cat, let's start by assigning one cat to each house. That means we've already accounted for 20 cats (one per house). Now, we have a total of 50 cats, so there are 50 - 20 = 30 cats left to distribute among the houses.\n\nOur goal is to minimize the number of houses that have more than one cat. To do that, we should try to distribute these remaining 30 cats in such a way that as few houses as possible get additional cats.\n\nThink about it: if we give one extra cat to a house, that house now has more than one cat. So, to minimize the number of houses with more than one cat, we should give as many extra cats as possible to fewer houses.\n\nFor example, if we give all 30 extra cats to one house, then only that one house has more than one cat. But is that possible? Well, yes, it's possible, but is that the minimum?\n\nWait a minute, no. Because if we give 30 cats to one house, that house would have 31 cats (remember, we already assigned one cat to each house initially). But perhaps we can distribute the cats in a way that more houses get some extra cats, but still keep the number of houses with more than one cat to a minimum.\n\nLet me think differently. If we want to minimize the number of houses with more than one cat, we should maximize the number of houses with exactly one cat.\n\nWe already have 20 houses with one cat each. But since there are 50 cats in total, we need to distribute the remaining 30 cats among some houses, which will then have more than one cat.\n\nTo minimize the number of houses with more than one cat, we should distribute these 30 extra cats to as few houses as possible.\n\nSo, if we give two extra cats to a house, that house will have three cats. If we give three extra cats to a house, it will have four cats, and so on.\n\nBut to minimize the number of houses with more than one cat, we should give as many extra cats as possible to fewer houses.\n\nSo, if we give all 30 extra cats to one house, that house will have 31 cats, and the other 19 houses will have one cat each. In this case, only one house has more than one cat.\n\nBut is this the minimum?\n\nWait, no. Because if we give 30 extra cats to one house, it's possible, but perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can distribute the extra cats in a way that more houses get a few extra cats each, but still keep the number of houses with more than one cat minimal.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s say we have h houses that have more than one cat. We need to find the smallest possible h such that the total number of cats is 50.\n\nWe know that there are 20 houses, and each has at least one cat, so the minimum total is 20 cats. We have 30 extra cats to distribute.\n\nIf we have h houses with more than one cat, then these h houses will receive all the extra 30 cats.\n\nTo minimize h, we need to maximize the number of cats each of these h houses receives.\n\nThe maximum number of extra cats per house is without any restriction, except that we can't have fractional cats, so we have to deal with whole numbers.\n\nSo, if we distribute the 30 extra cats as evenly as possible among h houses, each of these h houses will get floor(30/h) extra cats, and some might get one more.\n\nBut to minimize h, we need to see what's the smallest h that can accommodate all 30 extra cats.\n\nThis sounds like dividing 30 cats among h houses, with each house getting at least one extra cat.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each of these h houses can get more than one extra cat.\n\nSo, the minimum h is ceil(30/1), which is 30, but that would mean each house gets one extra cat, so 30 houses would have more than one cat.\n\nBut we have only 20 houses, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many extra cats per house.\n\nIf each of the h houses gets at least one extra cat, then the minimum h is ceil(30/1) = 30, but since we only have 20 houses, the maximum h can be is 20.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each house can receive any number of extra cats, and we need to find the smallest h such that the sum of extra cats in these h houses is at least 30.\n\nThis seems like a classic optimization problem.\n\nLet me consider that we have h houses with more than one cat, and these h houses receive all the 30 extra cats.\n\nTo minimize h, we need to maximize the number of cats each of these h houses receives.\n\nIf each of these h houses receives ceil(30/h) extra cats, then the total number of extra cats would be at least 30.\n\nWe need to find the smallest h such that h * ceil(30/h) >= 30.\n\nBut ceil(30/h) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 30/h.\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the minimum number of houses with more than one cat.\n\nSince each house with more than one cat can absorb multiple extra cats, the minimum number of such houses is ceil(30/(c-1)), where c is the maximum number of extra cats per house.\n\nBut there is no upper limit on c, so theoretically, one house can take all 30 extra cats.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of houses with more than one cat is 1.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Is there any constraint I'm missing?\n\nWait, the problem is to find the minimum number of houses that have more than one cat, given that each house has at least one cat and there are 50 cats in total.\n\nSo, in the scenario where one house has 31 cats (1 initial + 30 extra), and the other 19 houses have one cat each, that satisfies the condition with only one house having more than one cat.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is 1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies that every house has at least one cat, and some have more, and we need to find the minimum number of houses that must have more than one cat, given that there are 50 cats in total.\n\nIn that case, to minimize the number of houses with more than one cat, we should maximize the number of houses with exactly one cat.\n\nSo, if we have h houses with more than one cat, then the number of houses with exactly one cat is 20 - h.\n\nThe total number of cats would be (20 - h) * 1 + h * (c), where c is the average number of cats in houses with more than one cat.\n\nBut since c must be at least 2, we can set up the inequality:\n\n(20 - h) * 1 + h * 2 <= 50\n\nSimplifying:\n\n20 - h + 2h <= 50\n\n20 + h <= 50\n\nh <= 30\n\nBut h cannot be more than 20, since there are only 20 houses.\n\nWait, this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the minimum number of houses with more than one cat is when as many houses as possible have exactly one cat.\n\nSo, if we have h houses with more than one cat, then the total number of cats is at least (20 - h) * 1 + h * 2.\n\nBecause houses with more than one cat have at least two cats.\n\nWe need this total to be at least 50.\n\nSo:\n\n(20 - h) * 1 + h * 2 >= 50\n\nSimplifying:\n\n20 - h + 2h >= 50\n\n20 + h >= 50\n\nh >= 30\n\nBut h cannot be greater than 20, since there are only 20 houses.\n\nThis suggests that h >= 30, but since h <= 20, there is no solution, which contradicts the initial conditions.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the total number of cats is exactly 50.\n\nSo, (20 - h) * 1 + h * c = 50, where c >= 2.\n\nBut c can be any integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\nOur goal is to minimize h.\n\nTo minimize h, we need to maximize c.\n\nThe maximum c is not bounded, so theoretically, one house can have up to 50 cats, but since each house has at least one cat, one house can have up to 50 cats, and the others have one each.\n\nWait, but in that case, the total number of cats would be 1*19 + 50*1 = 69, which is more than 50.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nNo, wait, if one house has 50 cats, and the others have one each, the total is 50 + 19*1 = 69, which is more than 50.\n\nBut the total is supposed to be exactly 50.\n\nSo, that can't happen.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to set up the equation properly.\n\nWe have 20 houses, each with at least one cat.\n\nTotal cats are 50.\n\nLet h be the number of houses with more than one cat.\n\nThen, the number of houses with exactly one cat is 20 - h.\n\nThe total number of cats is:\n\n(20 - h)*1 + h*c = 50, where c >= 2.\n\nBut c is the average number of cats in houses with more than one cat.\n\nBut c must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of extra cats.\n\nWe have 20 houses, each with at least one cat, so that accounts for 20 cats.\n\nWe have 50 - 20 = 30 extra cats to distribute among some houses.\n\nTo minimize the number of houses that receive extra cats (i.e., have more than one cat), we should give as many extra cats as possible to fewer houses.\n\nSo, if we give all 30 extra cats to one house, that house will have 1 + 30 = 31 cats, and the other 19 houses will have one cat each.\n\nIn this case, only one house has more than one cat.\n\nIs this possible? Yes.\n\nIs there any constraint that prevents this? I don't think so.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of houses that have more than one cat is 1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the minimum number of houses that must have more than one cat, given that there are 50 cats in total.\n\nIn that case, we need to ensure that even if we try to distribute the cats to have as many houses as possible with only one cat, there are still some houses that necessarily have more than one cat.\n\nBut in this scenario, since 20 houses with one cat account for 20 cats, and there are 50 cats in total, there are 30 extra cats that must be distributed among the houses.\n\nTherefore, no matter how we distribute these 30 extra cats, some houses will have more than one cat.\n\nThe question is, what is the minimum number of houses that must have more than one cat.\n\nTo minimize this number, we should concentrate the extra cats in as few houses as possible.\n\nSo, if one house gets all 30 extra cats, then only that one house has more than one cat.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is 1.\n\nAlternatively, if we spread the extra cats among more houses, the number increases, but the minimum is still 1.\n\nHence, the answer is 1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose we have 20 houses, each with at least one cat.\n\nTotal cats are 50.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of houses that have more than one cat.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- h: number of houses with more than one cat.\n\n- Each of these h houses has at least 2 cats.\n\n- The remaining 20 - h houses have exactly one cat.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cats is at least:\n\nh * 2 + (20 - h) * 1 = h + 20.\n\nWe know that the total number of cats is 50, so:\n\nh + 20 <= 50\n\nh <= 30.\n\nBut h cannot be more than 20, so h <= 20.\n\nBut this doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the total number of cats is exactly 50.\n\nSo, h * c + (20 - h) * 1 = 50, where c >= 2.\n\nBut c can vary for different houses.\n\nTo minimize h, we need to maximize c for those h houses.\n\nThe maximum c is not bounded, so theoretically, one house can have up to 50 cats.\n\nBut if one house has 50 cats, and the others have one each, the total is 50 + 19 = 69, which is more than 50.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to set up the equation differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the h houses with more than one cat have exactly c cats each, where c >= 2.\n\nThen, the total number of cats is h * c + (20 - h) * 1 = 50.\n\nSo, h * c + 20 - h = 50\n\nh * (c - 1) = 30.\n\nNow, h must be a positive integer, and c must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\nSo, h divides 30, and h >=1, h <=20.\n\nPossible values of h are the divisors of 30 that are less than or equal to 20: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nBut h <=20, so h can be 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,20.\n\nWait, 30 is not allowed since h <=20.\n\nNow, for each h, c = (30/h) +1.\n\nBut c must be an integer >=2.\n\nSo, for h=1, c=30+1=31, which is valid.\n\nh=2, c=15+1=16.\n\nh=3, c=10+1=11.\n\nh=5, c=6+1=7.\n\nh=6, c=5+1=6.\n\nh=10, c=3+1=4.\n\nh=15, c=2+1=3.\n\nh=20, c=1.5+1=2.5, which is not an integer.\n\nWait, but c must be an integer, so h=20 is not possible because 30/20=1.5, and c=2.5 is not integer.\n\nTherefore, possible h values are 1,2,3,5,6,10,15.\n\nAmong these, the smallest h is 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of houses that have more than one cat is 1.\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if h=1 works.\n\nIf h=1, then c=31.\n\nSo, one house has 31 cats, and the other 19 houses have one cat each.\n\nTotal cats: 31 + 19*1 = 50.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, h=2, c=16: two houses have 16 cats each, and 18 houses have one cat each: 2*16 + 18*1 = 32 + 18 = 50.\n\nAnd so on for other h values.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is indeed 1.\n\nSo, the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
