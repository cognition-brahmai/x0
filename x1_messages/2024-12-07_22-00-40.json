        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are 6 adults and 8 children in this family gathering. Each adult has 2 siblings, and each child has 3 cousins. I need to find out how many siblings each child has.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the relationships here. Starting with the adults: each adult has 2 siblings. That means, for each adult, there are 2 other adults who are their siblings. Wait a minute, there are 6 adults in total. If each adult has 2 siblings, then the total number of sibling relationships among adults would be 6 times 2, but that counts each sibling relationship twice (since siblings are mutual), so the actual number of unique sibling relationships would be (6 * 2) / 2 = 6.\n\nBut, another way to look at it is that if each adult has 2 siblings, then the total number of adults is 6, which includes the adult themselves and their 2 siblings. Wait, that doesn't quite make sense because if I have 2 siblings, then including myself, there are 3 people in the group. But here, there are 6 adults in total. So maybe there are two groups of siblings among the adults.\n\nLet me consider that possibility. Suppose the 6 adults are divided into two groups, each group consisting of 3 siblings. That way, each adult has 2 siblings within their own group. That seems to fit the description.\n\nNow, moving on to the children: there are 8 children, and each child has 3 cousins. Wait, cousins are the children of one's parents' siblings, right? But in this scenario, since we're dealing with a single family gathering, I assume that the adults are possibly siblings or have some relationship that defines the children's cousins.\n\nGiven that the adults are divided into two groups of siblings, perhaps each group of adults has their own children, and the children of one group of adults are cousins to the children of the other group of adults.\n\nLet me see: if there are two groups of adults, each consisting of 3 siblings, then each group of adults would have their own children. If the children of one group of adults are considered cousins to the children of the other group of adults, then each child would have 3 cousins, assuming that the other group has 3 children.\n\nBut wait, there are 8 children in total. If there are two groups of adults, and assuming that each group of adults has an equal number of children, then each group would have 4 children (since 8 divided by 2 is 4). But according to the problem, each child has 3 cousins. If each group has 4 children, then the cousins would be the children from the other group, which would also have 4 children. But that would mean each child has 4 cousins, not 3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match the given information that each child has 3 cousins. So maybe the distribution of children among the adult groups is not equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adults are all siblings to each other, but that contradicts the earlier assumption that each adult has only 2 siblings. If all 6 adults are siblings, then each adult would have 5 siblings, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the adults are cousins themselves, but that might complicate things further. Let's stick to the initial assumption that the adults are divided into two groups of siblings, each group having 3 siblings.\n\nSo, if there are two groups of adults, each with 3 siblings, then the children of one group of adults would be cousins to the children of the other group of adults.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that one group of adults has 5 children, and the other group has 3 children. Then, each child from the first group would have 3 cousins (the children from the other group), and each child from the second group would have 5 cousins (the children from the first group). But according to the problem, each child has 3 cousins, which doesn't match this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of children per adult group needs to be adjusted. Suppose one group of adults has 4 children, and the other has 4 children, making 8 children in total. But as before, each child would have 4 cousins, which doesn't match the given 3 cousins per child.\n\nWait, perhaps the adults are not divided into two equal groups of siblings. Maybe one group has 2 siblings and the other has 4 siblings. Let's see:\n\nIf one group has 2 siblings and the other has 4 siblings, then the group with 2 siblings would have each adult having one sibling (but the problem states each adult has 2 siblings), which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are three groups of siblings among the adults: for example, two groups with 3 siblings each and one group with 0 siblings, but that doesn't add up to 6 adults.\n\nWait, no, if there are three groups: one with 3 siblings, another with 2 siblings, and another with 1 sibling, that would total 6 adults. But then, the adult with 1 sibling would have only one sibling, which contradicts the condition that each adult has 2 siblings.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the entire family structure. Suppose there are parents who have children, and some of those children are adults and some are still children. But the problem mentions 6 adults and 8 children, and each adult has 2 siblings, each child has 3 cousins.\n\nWait, perhaps the adults are all siblings to each other, each having 2 siblings, which would mean there are 3 adults in total, since if each has 2 siblings, they must all be siblings. But the problem states there are 6 adults, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adults are divided into families where each group has 3 siblings, as I initially thought.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe the adults are cousins to each other, but that seems unlikely because cousins typically don't consider each other as siblings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adults are from different generations, but that might not fit the sibling definition.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of extended family, with aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the 6 adults consist of parents and their siblings. For example, suppose there are two couples who are siblings. Each couple has two siblings, meaning that each adult has two siblings.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let\u2019s try to model it.\n\nSuppose there are two families:\n\n- Family 1: Parents A and B, who have children C, D, E.\n\n- Family 2: Parents C and D, who have children F, G, H, I.\n\nWait, that seems too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all adults are siblings, but that contradicts the earlier point that each adult has only two siblings if there are six adults.\n\nWait, perhaps the adults are divided into families where each group has three siblings.\n\nSo, suppose there are two groups of adults:\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B, C (each has two siblings: the other two in the group)\n\n- Group 2: Adults D, E, F (each has two siblings: the other two in the group)\n\nThen, the children are the offspring of these adults.\n\nAssuming each group of adults has children:\n\n- Group 1 has children G, H, I, J\n\n- Group 2 has children K, L, M, N\n\nThen, the cousins would be the children of the other group.\n\nBut then, each child would have 4 cousins, which doesn't match the given 3 cousins per child.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one group has 3 children and the other has 5.\n\n- Group 1: 3 children\n\n- Group 2: 5 children\n\nThen, each child in group 1 would have 5 cousins, and each child in group 2 would have 3 cousins. But the problem states that each child has 3 cousins, which isn't consistent here.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I need to consider that the adults are not divided into groups of siblings, but have a different relationship structure.\n\nLet\u2019s try to think of the adults as being from different generations.\n\nSuppose there are grandparents, their children (the adults), and the grandchildren (the children).\n\nBut then, the relationships would be more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of family trees or diagrams, but that might not be feasible here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the problem from the perspective of graph theory, where individuals are nodes and relationships are edges.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nThere are 6 adults and 8 children in a family gathering. Each adult has exactly 2 siblings among the adults, and each child has exactly 3 cousins among the children.\n\nI need to find out how many siblings each child has.\n\nAlright, perhaps I need to consider that the adults are divided into families where each family has 3 siblings, as each adult has 2 siblings.\n\nSo, if there are 6 adults and each has 2 siblings, then they must be divided into two families of 3 siblings each.\n\n- Family 1: Adults A, B, C (each has two siblings: the other two in the family)\n\n- Family 2: Adults D, E, F (each has two siblings: the other two in the family)\n\nNow, the children are the offspring of these adults.\n\nAssuming that the children are divided among these families, let's say:\n\n- Family 1 has some children\n\n- Family 2 has some children\n\nAnd the cousins are the children from the other family.\n\nGiven that each child has 3 cousins, that means that the number of children in the other family is 3.\n\nSo, if Family 1 has x children, then Family 2 has 3 children, and vice versa.\n\nBut the total number of children is 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because if Family 1 has x children and Family 2 has 3 children, then x + 3 = 8, so x = 5.\n\nBut then, the children in Family 1 would have 3 cousins (the 3 children in Family 2), and the children in Family 2 would have 5 cousins (the 5 children in Family 1). But the problem states that each child has exactly 3 cousins, which isn't satisfied here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the concept of cousins is differently defined here. Maybe cousins are considered children of one's parents' siblings, meaning that the cousins are only the children of one's own aunts and uncles, excluding their own siblings.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the number of cousins each child has is equal to the number of siblings their parents have, multiplied by the average number of children per sibling.\n\nWait, that might be a way to model it.\n\nGiven that each adult has 2 siblings, meaning that each adult is part of a group of 3 siblings (themselves and their 2 siblings).\n\nAssuming that each group of siblings has the same number of children, then the number of cousins each child has would be the number of aunties and uncles multiplied by the number of children per auntie or uncle.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of cousins per child.\n\nIf each child has 3 cousins, and these cousins are the children of their parents' siblings, then:\n\n- Each child has parents who are adults.\n\n- Each parent has 2 siblings.\n\n- Assuming that each of these siblings has the same number of children, say c children per sibling.\n\n- Then, the number of cousins per child would be 2 * c.\n\nBut the problem states that each child has 3 cousins, so 2 * c = 3, which would mean c = 1.5.\n\nBut the number of children per sibling can't be a fraction, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that each parent has 2 siblings, and each of those siblings has some children, but the number of children per sibling may vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the definition of cousins here is different, or perhaps there is a different structure to the family.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the 6 adults are all siblings, but that contradicts the fact that each adult has only 2 siblings, because if there are 6 siblings, each would have 5 siblings, not 2.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the adults can't all be siblings.\n\nTherefore, the only way for each adult to have exactly 2 siblings is if the adults are divided into groups where each group has 3 siblings.\n\nSo, two groups of 3 siblings each.\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B, C (each has two siblings: the other two in the group)\n\n- Group 2: Adults D, E, F (each has two siblings: the other two in the group)\n\nNow, the children are the offspring of these adults.\n\nAssuming that all children of Group 1 adults are cousins to all children of Group 2 adults, and vice versa.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Group 1 adults have a total of c1 children.\n\n- Group 2 adults have a total of c2 children.\n\nGiven that the total number of children is 8, so c1 + c2 = 8.\n\nEach child has 3 cousins, which are the children of the other group.\n\nTherefore, the number of cousins for each child is equal to the number of children in the other group.\n\nSo, for children in Group 1, their cousins are the c2 children in Group 2, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, c2 = 3 for children in Group 1, and c1 = 3 for children in Group 2.\n\nBut that would imply that c1 = 3 and c2 = 3, which totals 6 children, but the problem states there are 8 children.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the definition of cousins is different here. Maybe cousins include the children of cousins, or some other relationship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adults have children who are also considered siblings within their own group.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the adults are from different generations.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose there are grandparents who have children (the adults), and those adults have children (the children).\n\nIf the grandparents have 3 children (adults), and each adult has 2 siblings (the other two adults), that fits the adult sibling structure.\n\nBut then, if these 3 adults each have children, and there are 8 children in total, then the number of children per adult could vary.\n\nLet\u2019s say Adult 1 has c1 children, Adult 2 has c2 children, and Adult 3 has c3 children, with c1 + c2 + c3 = 8.\n\nNow, the cousins for each child would be the children of the other adults.\n\nSo, for a child of Adult 1, their cousins would be the children of Adults 2 and 3, totaling c2 + c3 cousins.\n\nSimilarly, for a child of Adult 2, cousins would be c1 + c3, and for a child of Adult 3, cousins would be c1 + c2.\n\nAccording to the problem, each child has exactly 3 cousins.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- For children of Adult 1: c2 + c3 = 3\n\n- For children of Adult 2: c1 + c3 = 3\n\n- For children of Adult 3: c1 + c2 = 3\n\nAnd we also have c1 + c2 + c3 = 8.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. c2 + c3 = 3\n\n2. c1 + c3 = 3\n\n3. c1 + c2 = 3\n\n4. c1 + c2 + c3 = 8\n\nLet\u2019s try to solve this system.\n\nFrom equation 1: c2 = 3 - c3\n\nFrom equation 2: c1 = 3 - c3\n\nFrom equation 3: c1 + c2 = 3\n\nSubstituting c1 and c2 from above:\n\n(3 - c3) + (3 - c3) = 3\n\n6 - 2c3 = 3\n\n2c3 = 3\n\nc3 = 1.5\n\nBut the number of children must be an integer, so this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution in this scenario.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption about the adults being from one generation with a common parent is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are two sets of siblings among the adults.\n\nSuppose the 6 adults consist of two sets of three siblings each.\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B, C (each has two siblings: the other two in the group)\n\n- Group 2: Adults D, E, F (each has two siblings: the other two in the group)\n\nNow, the children are the offspring of these adults.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the children are divided between the two groups of adults.\n\nSuppose Group 1 has c1 children and Group 2 has c2 children, with c1 + c2 = 8.\n\nThen, for a child of Group 1, their cousins would be the children of Group 2, which is c2 children.\n\nSimilarly, for a child of Group 2, their cousins would be the children of Group 1, which is c1 children.\n\nGiven that each child has exactly 3 cousins, we have:\n\n- c2 = 3 for children in Group 1\n\n- c1 = 3 for children in Group 2\n\nBut then c1 + c2 = 6, which contradicts the total of 8 children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more groups of siblings among the adults.\n\nSuppose there are three groups of siblings among the adults:\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B (each has one sibling)\n\n- Group 2: Adults C, D (each has one sibling)\n\n- Group 3: Adults E, F (each has one sibling)\n\nBut then each adult has only one sibling, which contradicts the condition that each adult has two siblings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are overlapping sibling groups, but that seems complicated.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the number of siblings each child has.\n\nSiblings are brothers and sisters within the same family.\n\nSo, for each child, the number of siblings is the number of other children who share the same parents.\n\nThe problem is to find this number.\n\nGiven that each child has 3 cousins, and cousins are the children of one's parents' siblings, we can use this information to find the number of siblings.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let s be the number of siblings each child has, excluding themselves.\n\n- Let p be the number of parents (since parents are adults, and adults have siblings, but this might be complicated).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the structure of the family.\n\nSuppose there are multiple families, each with their own parents and children, and the adults are siblings to each other.\n\nGiven that each adult has 2 siblings, that suggests that the adults are divided into groups where each group has 3 siblings.\n\nSo, two groups of 3 siblings each.\n\nNow, assuming that each group of siblings has their own children, and the children of one group are cousins to the children of the other group.\n\nIf each group has the same number of children, then the number of cousins each child has would be equal to the number of children in the other group.\n\nBut in this case, with 8 total children, divided into two groups, the only way to divide them evenly would be 4 and 4, but that would mean each child has 4 cousins, which contradicts the given 3 cousins per child.\n\nAlternatively, if one group has 5 children and the other has 3, then:\n\n- Children in the first group would have 3 cousins (from the second group)\n\n- Children in the second group would have 5 cousins (from the first group)\n\nBut the problem states that each child has exactly 3 cousins, which isn't satisfied here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the groups have different numbers of children, but I can't see how that would work to satisfy the condition that each child has exactly 3 cousins.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial assumption about the adults being divided into two groups of three siblings each is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adults are arranged in a different way.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps some adults are siblings, and others are not.\n\nFor example, maybe there are three pairs of siblings among the adults: (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), each pair being siblings, and no other sibling relationships.\n\nBut then, each adult would have one sibling, which contradicts the condition that each adult has two siblings.\n\nTherefore, that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are overlapping sibling groups, but that seems too complicated.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I need to consider that the adults are cousins to each other, but that might not fit the sibling definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some adults are siblings, and others are spouses, but the problem refers to adults having siblings, not spouses.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each adult has 2 siblings,\" which presumably means siblings from the same parents, i.e., brothers and sisters.\n\nGiven that, and considering the earlier attempts, it seems that the only consistent structure is two groups of three siblings each among the adults.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B, C (each has two siblings: the other two in the group)\n\n- Group 2: Adults D, E, F (each has two siblings: the other two in the group)\n\nNow, assuming that the children are divided between these two groups, and cousins are the children of the other group's adults.\n\nIf each group has the same number of children, then with 8 total children, it's not divisible evenly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one group has more children than the other.\n\nSuppose Group 1 has 5 children and Group 2 has 3 children.\n\nThen, for children in Group 1, their cousins would be the 3 children in Group 2, which matches the condition of having 3 cousins.\n\nSimilarly, for children in Group 2, their cousins would be the 5 children in Group 1, which doesn't match the condition of having 3 cousins.\n\nTherefore, this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, suppose Group 1 has 4 children and Group 2 has 4 children.\n\nThen, each child would have 4 cousins, which doesn't match the condition of having 3 cousins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the groups have different numbers of children, but I can't see a combination that would satisfy the condition for all children.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial assumption about the adult groups is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more than two groups of siblings among the adults.\n\nSuppose there are three groups of two siblings each:\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B\n\n- Group 2: Adults C, D\n\n- Group 3: Adults E, F\n\nThen, each adult has one sibling, which contradicts the condition that each adult has two siblings.\n\nTherefore, that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is one group of four siblings and one group of two siblings.\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B, C, D (each has three siblings)\n\n- Group 2: Adults E, F (each has one sibling)\n\nBut this contradicts the condition that each adult has two siblings.\n\nTherefore, that can't be the case either.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I need to consider that some adults are half-siblings or have different parentage, but that might be too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adults are divided into families where some adults are siblings, and others are related differently.\n\nGiven the constraints, it seems that the only possible structure is two groups of three siblings each among the adults.\n\nTherefore, sticking with that:\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B, C (each has two siblings: the other two)\n\n- Group 2: Adults D, E, F (each has two siblings: the other two)\n\nNow, the children are the offspring of these adults.\n\nAssuming that the children are divided between the two groups, and cousins are the children of the other group's adults.\n\nGiven that each child has exactly 3 cousins, that would require that the other group has exactly 3 children.\n\nBut with 8 total children, if one group has x children and the other has 8 - x children, then for x = 3 and 8 - x = 5, or x = 5 and 8 - x = 3.\n\nIn either case, the children in the group with 5 children would have 3 cousins, and the children in the group with 3 children would have 5 cousins, which contradicts the condition that each child has exactly 3 cousins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in the problem statement, or perhaps there is a different interpretation of the relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adults are related in a different way, such as some being siblings and others being spouses of siblings.\n\nBut the problem specifies that each adult has 2 siblings, which suggests that the relationships are strictly between siblings.\n\nGiven this, and the earlier conclusions, it seems that there is no consistent way to satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem has no solution, or there is a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of siblings each child has can be determined independently of the adult relationships.\n\nBut the problem seems to link the adult and child relationships.\n\nGiven all this, I'm stuck and can't find a way to determine how many siblings each child has based on the given information.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the number of siblings each child has is unrelated to the adult sibling relationships.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as the problem connects the two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a formula or mathematical relationship that can be applied here to solve for the number of siblings per child.\n\nGiven that each child has 3 cousins, and cousins are the children of their parents' siblings, we can try to model this mathematically.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let s be the number of siblings each child has, excluding themselves.\n\n- Let n be the number of adults in each sibling group.\n\nFrom earlier, we assumed n = 3 for the adult groups.\n\nThen, each adult has 2 siblings, which fits.\n\nNow, if each group of adults has children, and the children of one group are cousins to the children of the other group, then the number of cousins per child would be equal to the number of children in the other group.\n\nGiven that, and with two groups of adults, each with 3 adults, and a total of 8 children, we can set up the equation as before, which leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more than two groups of adults.\n\nSuppose there are three groups of adults, each with 2 siblings.\n\n- Group 1: Adults A, B, C (each has two siblings: the other two)\n\n- Group 2: Adults D, E, F (each has two siblings: the other two)\n\nBut with 6 adults, that would require two groups of three siblings each.\n\nBut as before, this doesn't resolve the issue with the number of children.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is one group of three siblings and one group of three siblings, but with different numbers of children, but as shown earlier, that doesn't work with the cousin condition.\n\nGiven all this, I'm unable to find a consistent solution to the problem as stated.\n\nPerhaps the problem is misstated or has inconsistent conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different approach or perspective that I'm missing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this and the lack of progress, I'll have to conclude that the problem doesn't have a feasible solution under the given constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
