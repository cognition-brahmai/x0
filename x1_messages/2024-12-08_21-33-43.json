        "content": "To find out the total units produced in a 24-hour period for both products A and B, we need to calculate the hourly production for each product and then multiply by the number of hours in a day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total units of product A produced in 24 hours:\n\nProduct A production per hour: 500 units\n\nTotal hours in a day: 24 hours\n\nTotal units of product A in 24 hours = 500 units/hour * 24 hours = 12,000 units\n\nNext, let's calculate the total units of product B produced in 24 hours:\n\nProduct B production per hour: 300 units\n\nTotal hours in a day: 24 hours\n\nTotal units of product B in 24 hours = 300 units/hour * 24 hours = 7,200 units\n\nNow, to find the total units produced for both products combined:\n\nTotal units = Total units of product A + Total units of product B\n\nTotal units = 12,000 units + 7,200 units = 19,200 units\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce a total of 19,200 units in a 24-hour period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19200} \\]"
