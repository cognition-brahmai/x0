His three laws of motion, laid out in his seminal work \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica,\" published in 1687, are fundamental to our understanding of how objects move and interact with each other. These laws have been the cornerstone of classical mechanics for centuries and continue to be essential in various fields, from engineering to astronomy."
