No, no, nothing of the sort. It's just that, well, you know how it is when you're trying to fix something that's broken in a way that only you can understand. It's like trying to explain quantum physics to a cat\u2014it's just not going to happen in the time you have.\n\nSo, I was down in the lab, tinkering with the new arc reactor design. I thought I had it all figured out, but then, out of nowhere, this one component decided to act up. It's like it had a mind of its own, messing with me. But, as always, I rose to the challenge. I mean, what's life without a good puzzle to solve, right?\n\nAnyway, before I knew it, hours had flown by, and I realized that I was supposed to meet you an hour ago. Ugh, time just slips away when you're immersed in something, doesn't it? But no excuses, I know. You deserve better, and I promise to make it up to you.\n\nSo, I'll be there as soon as I can. Maybe I can bring something to make it better, like your favorite chocolate or something. Although, knowing you, you'd probably prefer if I just showed up on time next time.\n\nAgain, I'm really sorry, Pep. You know how much I value our time together, and I don't want to take that for granted.\n\nSee you soon,\n\nTony"
