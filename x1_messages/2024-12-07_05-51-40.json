        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what's the probability of drawing four aces in a row if you draw one card at a time without replacement? Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, and among those, there are 4 aces\u2014ace of hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. So, the total number of aces is 4.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of drawing four aces in a row without replacement. That means once I draw a card, I don't put it back into the deck. So, the number of cards left in the deck decreases with each draw.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing four aces in a row.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst draw: The probability of drawing an ace from a full deck of 52 cards is 4 aces out of 52 cards, which is 4/52. That simplifies to 1/13.\n\nOkay, so P(first ace) = 1/13.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the card, the deck now has 51 cards left, and only 3 aces remain.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a second ace is 3/51.\n\nSimilarly, P(second ace) = 3/51, which simplifies to 1/17.\n\nFor the third draw, if the first two were aces, then there are now 50 cards left and 2 aces.\n\nSo, P(third ace) = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nFinally, for the fourth draw, if the first three were aces, there are 49 cards left and only 1 ace remaining.\n\nSo, P(fourth ace) = 1/49.\n\nNow, since these are sequential draws without replacement, to find the overall probability of all four events happening in sequence, I need to multiply their individual probabilities together.\n\nSo, P(four aces in a row) = P(first ace) * P(second ace) * P(third ace) * P(fourth ace)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP = (1/13) * (1/17) * (1/25) * (1/49)\n\nNow, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, multiply 1/13 by 1/17:\n\n(1/13) * (1/17) = 1/(13*17) = 1/221\n\nThen, multiply that by 1/25:\n\n(1/221) * (1/25) = 1/(221*25) = 1/5525\n\nFinally, multiply by 1/49:\n\n(1/5525) * (1/49) = 1/(5525*49)\n\nNow, 5525 multiplied by 49.\n\nLet's compute 5525 * 50 first, which is 276250, and then subtract 5525 (since 49 is 50 -1):\n\n276250 - 5525 = 270725\n\nSo, 5525 * 49 = 270725\n\nTherefore, P = 1/270725\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nLet's consider the total number of ways to draw four cards in a row without replacement from 52 cards. That would be 52 choose 4, but since the order matters here because we're drawing one at a time, it's actually a permutation.\n\nThe number of permutations of 52 cards taken 4 at a time is 52P4 = 52! / (52-4)! = 52 * 51 * 50 * 49\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to draw the four aces in order. Since there's only one set of four aces, and they can be drawn in any order, but since we're considering the sequence, there are 4! = 24 ways to draw the four aces in sequence.\n\nWait, actually, no. If we're drawing four aces in a row without replacement, and order matters, then there are 4 options for the first ace, 3 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the fourth.\n\nSo, the number of favorable sequences is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n\nBut, in reality, there's only one specific sequence of four aces: ace of hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades, but actually, since aces are of different suits, each sequence is unique.\n\nWait, no. Since the aces are indistinguishable in terms of their rank, but each has a different suit, so each sequence is unique.\n\nBut in terms of probability, since we're dealing with specific cards, it's better to think in terms of permutations.\n\nSo, total number of possible sequences of four cards drawn from 52 is 52P4 = 52 * 51 * 50 * 49\n\nNumber of favorable sequences where all four are aces is 4P4 = 4! = 24\n\nTherefore, P = 24 / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49)\n\nWait, but earlier I had P = (4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) * (1/49) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) = 24 / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49)\n\nSo, that matches.\n\nNow, let's calculate that value.\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n52 * 51 = 2652\n\n2652 * 50 = 132600\n\n132600 * 49 = 650000? Wait, let's compute it properly.\n\n52 * 51 = 2652\n\n2652 * 50 = 132600\n\n132600 * 49 =\n\n132600 * 50 = 6,630,000\n\nThen subtract 132600 (since 49 is 50 -1):\n\n6,630,000 - 132,600 = 6,497,400\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication.\n\nActually, 52 * 51 is 2,652\n\n2,652 * 50 = 132,600\n\n132,600 * 49 =\n\n132,600 * 50 = 6,630,000\n\nThen subtract 132,600 (since 49 is 50 -1):\n\n6,630,000 - 132,600 = 6,497,400\n\nWait, but 132,600 * 49 should be:\n\n49 * 132,600 = 49 * 132,600\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\n40 * 132,600 = 5,304,000\n\n9 * 132,600 = 1,193,400\n\nAdd them up: 5,304,000 + 1,193,400 = 6,497,400\n\nOkay, so the denominator is 6,497,400\n\nNow, numerator is 24\n\nSo, P = 24 / 6,497,400\n\nSimplify that fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 24:\n\n24 / 24 = 1\n\n6,497,400 / 24 = 270,725\n\nSo, P = 1 / 270,725\n\nWait, earlier I had P = 1 / 270,725 directly. So, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, let's cross-verify with another approach.\n\nWe can also think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 aces out of 4 is C(4,4) = 1\n\nThe number of ways to choose any 4 cards out of 52 is C(52,4)\n\nSo, P = C(4,4) / C(52,4)\n\nBut C(4,4) = 1\n\nC(52,4) = 52! / (4! * 48!) = (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) / 24\n\nSo, P = 1 / [ (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) / 24 ] = 24 / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49)\n\nAgain, that's the same as before, 24 / 6,497,400 = 1 / 270,725\n\nSo, both methods confirm the same probability.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing four aces in a row without replacement is 1 in 270,725.\n\nTo put that into perspective, that's a very low probability. It's roughly equal to 0.00037%, which is extremely unlikely.\n\nSo, in a standard deck of 52 playing cards, drawing four aces in a row without replacement is a rare event.\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{270725}} \\]"
