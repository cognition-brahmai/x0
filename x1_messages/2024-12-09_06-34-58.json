        "content": "So there are 15 boys and 10 girls in the class, and the teacher wants to pick one boy and one girl to be class representatives. We need to find out how many different pairs of representatives can be chosen.\n\nFirst, let's think about what's being asked. We need to choose one boy and one girl, and we want to know all the possible combinations of boys and girls that can be picked for these positions.\n\nSince the choices are independent\u2014meaning, choosing a boy doesn't affect which girl is chosen and vice versa\u2014we can use the multiplication principle of counting.\n\nThe multiplication principle says that if there are m ways to do one thing, and n ways to do another, then there are m times n ways to do both.\n\nIn this case, there are 15 ways to choose a boy (since there are 15 boys), and 10 ways to choose a girl (since there are 10 girls).\n\nSo, the total number of different pairs should be 15 multiplied by 10, which is 150.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using combinations formula?\n\nYes, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which seems to be the case here. The pair is just a combination of one boy and one girl, without regarding who is chosen first.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nBut in this scenario, we're choosing one boy from 15 and one girl from 10, so it's C(15, 1) for boys and C(10, 1) for girls.\n\nC(15, 1) is 15, and C(10, 1) is 10.\n\nAgain, since these are independent choices, we multiply them: 15 * 10 = 150.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other approach to confirm this?\n\nPerhaps we can think about it in terms of permutations, but since the order doesn't matter here, combinations should be the correct approach.\n\nWait, but permutations are used when order matters. For example, if we were arranging the representatives in some order, then permutations would be relevant.\n\nBut in this case, the pair is just a pair, without any regard to order. So, combinations are appropriate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider all possible pairs.\n\nImagine listing all possible boys and girls together as pairs.\n\nThere are 15 boys, and for each boy, there are 10 different girls he can be paired with.\n\nSo, for boy 1, there are 10 possible pairs (boy1, girl1) up to (boy1, girl10).\n\nSimilarly, for boy 2, there are another 10 pairs, and so on, up to boy 15.\n\nSo, total pairs would be 15 boys times 10 girls, which again is 150.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about it from the girls' perspective, each girl can be paired with any of the 15 boys.\n\nSo, 10 girls times 15 boys is also 150.\n\nIt seems consistent no matter which way we approach it.\n\nIs there any chance that some pairs might be counted twice?\n\nNo, because each boy is unique and each girl is unique, so each pair (boyX, girlY) is distinct and only counted once.\n\nAlso, since we're choosing only one boy and one girl, there are no issues with multiple selections or overlapping pairs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different pairs of representatives that can be chosen is 150.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
