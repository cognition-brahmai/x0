        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company charges $20 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 7 days and driving it for 350 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for renting the car for 7 days. That should be straightforward: $20 per day times 7 days.\n\n$20 * 7 = $140\n\nOkay, so the rental cost for 7 days is $140.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 350 miles. The charge is 15 cents per mile. So, 350 miles times $0.15 per mile.\n\n350 * 0.15 = $52.50\n\nSo, the mileage cost is $52.50.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I'll add the rental cost and the mileage cost together.\n\n$140 + $52.50 = $192.50\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for 7 days and drive it for 350 miles would be $192.50.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, rental cost: $20 per day for 7 days is indeed $140.\n\nSecond, mileage cost: 350 miles times $0.15 per mile.\n\nLet me do that multiplication again: 350 * 0.15.\n\n350 * 0.10 = $35\n\n350 * 0.05 = $17.50\n\nSo, $35 + $17.50 = $52.50. That checks out.\n\nNow, adding $140 and $52.50 should be $192.50.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in decimals:\n\n$140.00 + $52.50 = $192.50\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI should also consider if there are any additional fees or discounts, but based on the information provided, there don't appear to be any.\n\nSo, the final answer is $192.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192.50} \\]"
