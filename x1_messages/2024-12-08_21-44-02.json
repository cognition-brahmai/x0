They decided to split the cost equally among themselves. The question is, how much will each friend have to contribute?\n\nAlright, to figure this out, I think the simplest way is to divide the total cost of the gift by the number of friends. So, that would be $120 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do the math here. 120 divided by 8.\n\nWell, 8 times 15 is 120, so each friend would contribute $15.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe to double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how much each person pays towards the total cost. So, if there are 8 friends, each one pays an equal share.\n\nLet's see, $120 divided by 8 equals $15 per friend.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nPerhaps there are additional costs, like wrapping or something, but the question doesn't mention any extra expenses, so I'll assume the total cost is just $120 for the gift itself.\n\nAlso, all friends are splitting the cost equally, so no one is paying more or less than others.\n\nSo, yes, each friend contributes $15.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can multiply $15 by 8 to see if I get back to $120.\n\n15 times 8 is indeed 120.\n\nPerfect, that confirms it.\n\nI think that's the answer: each friend will contribute $15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
