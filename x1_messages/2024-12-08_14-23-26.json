        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that in this town, 2/3 of the population are adults. Out of these adults, 1/4 are teachers, and there are 12 teachers in total. We need to find out the total population of the town.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n- Fraction of the population that are adults: 2/3\n\n- Fraction of adults that are teachers: 1/4\n\n- Number of teachers: 12\n\nWe need to find the total population, which I'll call P.\n\nLet's think about this. If 2/3 of the population are adults, then the number of adults is (2/3) * P.\n\nNow, among these adults, 1/4 are teachers. So, the number of teachers is (1/4) * (2/3) * P.\n\nWe know that the number of teachers is 12. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(1/4) * (2/3) * P = 12\n\nNow, let's simplify the left side of the equation.\n\nFirst, multiply 1/4 and 2/3:\n\n(1/4) * (2/3) = (1*2)/(4*3) = 2/12 = 1/6\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(1/6) * P = 12\n\nNow, to find P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6:\n\nP = 12 * 6\n\nP = 72\n\nSo, the total population of the town is 72.\n\nLet me just double-check that this makes sense.\n\nIf the total population is 72, then the number of adults is 2/3 of 72, which is 48.\n\nOut of these 48 adults, 1/4 are teachers, which is 12.\n\nYes, that matches the given number of teachers. So, the total population is indeed 72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
