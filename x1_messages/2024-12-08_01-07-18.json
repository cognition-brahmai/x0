        "content": "So, the store has this deal where for every 5 items you buy, you get an extra one for free. You're wondering how many items you'd end up with if you purchase 30 items. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand the deal. For every group of 5 items you buy, you get 1 additional item free. So, for each set of 5 purchased, you get 6 in total.\n\nNow, if you buy 30 items, we need to see how many sets of 5 are there in 30. That would be 30 divided by 5, which is 6 sets.\n\nSince each set gives you 1 free item, for 6 sets, you'd get 6 free items.\n\nSo, the total items you'd receive would be the 30 you purchased plus the 6 free items, totaling 36 items.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Sometimes these bulk discount deals can be a bit tricky.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that for every 5 purchased, you get 1 free, which means for every 5 items, you get 6 items in total without paying for the 6th.\n\nSo, if you have 30 purchased items, and each set of 5 purchased items gives you 1 free, then indeed, you have 30 / 5 = 6 sets, and thus 6 free items.\n\nTherefore, total items = purchased items + free items = 30 + 6 = 36.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of it as for every 5 purchased, you get 6 in total. So, for 6 sets (since 30 / 5 = 6), you'd have 6 sets * 6 items per set = 36 items.\n\nEither way, it seems like you'd end up with 36 items.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the deal. Maybe the free items can be stacked or something, but based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, purchasing 30 items gets you 6 free items, totaling 36 items.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
