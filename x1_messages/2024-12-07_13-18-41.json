        "content": "So I have this problem here: calculate the sum of an infinite geometric series where the first term, a\u2081, is 4, and the common ratio, r, is 1/3. Hmm, I remember that for infinite geometric series, there's a formula to find the sum, but I need to make sure I recall it correctly.\n\nFirst off, I know that a geometric series is one where each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, in this case, starting with 4, the next term would be 4 times 1/3, which is 4/3, then 4/3 times 1/3 is 4/9, and so on.\n\nNow, for an infinite geometric series, the sum S can be found using the formula:\n\nS = a\u2081 / (1 - r)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the common ratio r is between -1 and 1 (excluding -1 and 1 themselves) for the series to converge. Otherwise, the sum would be infinite, and that doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nIn this problem, r is 1/3, which is definitely between -1 and 1, so the series converges, and I can use the formula.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 4 / (1 - 1/3)\n\nFirst, calculate 1 - 1/3, which is 2/3.\n\nSo, S = 4 / (2/3)\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so:\n\nS = 4 * (3/2) = 12/2 = 6\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I'm missing anything.\n\nMaybe I should derive the formula to understand it better. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is:\n\nS\u2099 = a\u2081 * (1 - r\u207f) / (1 - r)\n\nFor an infinite series, n approaches infinity. If |r| < 1, then r\u207f approaches 0 as n approaches infinity.\n\nSo, S = a\u2081 * (1 - 0) / (1 - r) = a\u2081 / (1 - r)\n\nYes, that matches the formula I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it this way:\n\nS = a\u2081 + a\u2081*r + a\u2081*r\u00b2 + a\u2081*r\u00b3 + ...\n\nIf I multiply both sides by r:\n\nS*r = a\u2081*r + a\u2081*r\u00b2 + a\u2081*r\u00b3 + a\u2081*r\u2074 + ...\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\nS - S*r = a\u2081\n\nS(1 - r) = a\u2081\n\nTherefore, S = a\u2081 / (1 - r)\n\nNice, that makes sense.\n\nNow, plugging in the values again:\n\nS = 4 / (1 - 1/3) = 4 / (2/3) = 6\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the series explicitly:\n\n4 + 4*(1/3) + 4*(1/3)\u00b2 + 4*(1/3)\u00b3 + ... = 4 + 4/3 + 4/9 + 4/27 + ...\n\nIf I add these up:\n\n4 + 4/3 = 12/3 + 4/3 = 16/3\n\n16/3 + 4/9 = 48/9 + 4/9 = 52/9\n\n52/9 + 4/27 = 156/27 + 4/27 = 160/27\n\nAnd so on. If I continue adding terms, the sum gets closer and closer to 6.\n\nFor example:\n\n160/27 \u2248 5.9259\n\nIf I add the next term, 4/(3^4) = 4/81:\n\n160/27 + 4/81 = 480/81 + 4/81 = 484/81 \u2248 5.9753\n\nGetting closer to 6.\n\nSo, yes, the sum should be 6.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can use the concept of limits.\n\nThe sum S is the limit of S\u2099 as n approaches infinity:\n\nS = lim (n\u2192\u221e) [a\u2081 * (1 - r\u207f)/(1 - r)]\n\nSince |r| < 1, r\u207f \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e, so S = a\u2081 / (1 - r) = 4 / (2/3) = 6\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum as a geometric series in terms of fractions.\n\n4 + 4/3 + 4/9 + 4/27 + ...\n\nThis is similar to the geometric series for 1/ (1 - x) where x = 1/3.\n\nBut wait, 1 / (1 - x) = 1 + x + x\u00b2 + x\u00b3 + ...\n\nSo, for x = 1/3:\n\n1 / (1 - 1/3) = 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ... = 3/2\n\nBut in our series, each term is 4 times the corresponding term in that series.\n\nTherefore, S = 4 * (1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ...) = 4 * (3/2) = 6\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the general formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, it's S = a\u2081 / (1 - r), which again gives S = 4 / (2/3) = 6\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The sum of the series is 6.\n\nJust to make sure there are no tricks here, is there any possibility that the series doesn't converge or that I'm misapplying the formula?\n\nWell, r = 1/3, which is less than 1 in absolute value, so the series converges absolutely. No issues there.\n\nAlso, the first term is positive, and the common ratio is positive, so no complications from negative terms or complex numbers.\n\nTherefore, the sum is definitely 6.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
