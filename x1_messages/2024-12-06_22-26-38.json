        "content": "Let's see. I have a box with 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 6 green balls. So in total, there are 5 + 4 + 6 = 15 balls. I need to pick three balls without replacement and find the probability that I get at least one ball of each color.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"at least one ball of each color\" means. That means in the three balls I pick, there should be one red, one blue, and one green ball. There shouldn't be any two balls of the same color.\n\nTo find this probability, I can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nSo, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm picking three balls out of 15 without replacement, the total number of ways to do this is the combination of 15 balls taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is C(15, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3!(15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12!) / (3! \u00d7 12!)) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (2730) / 6 = 455\n\nSo, there are 455 possible ways to pick three balls out of 15.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to pick one ball of each color.\n\nSince there are three colors, and I need one of each, I can think of it as picking one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red ball out of five is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick one blue ball out of four is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nAnd the number of ways to pick one green ball out of six is C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 120 / 455.\n\nBut I should simplify this fraction.\n\nLet's divide numerator and denominator by 5: 120 \u00f7 5 = 24, 455 \u00f7 5 = 91.\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 24/91.\n\nWait a minute, but I think this might not be correct. Let me double-check.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the total number of ways to pick at least one of each color.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of not getting at least one of each color, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, the probability of not getting at least one of each color would be the probability of getting all three balls of the same color or two balls of one color and the third ball of another color.\n\nBut that seems more complicated. Maybe sticking to the initial approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of ways to pick one red, one blue, and one green ball, divided by the total number of ways to pick any three balls.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier: 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 / C(15, 3) = 120 / 455 = 24/91.\n\nBut I have a feeling that this might not account for some arrangements. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the order in which the balls are picked. But since we're dealing with combinations, order doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use permutations.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I multiplied the number of ways to pick one red, one blue, and one green ball, which is C(5,1) \u00d7 C(4,1) \u00d7 C(6,1) = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nAnd the total number of ways to pick any three balls is C(15,3) = 455.\n\nSo, Probability = 120 / 455 = 24/91.\n\nBut let me verify this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFirst, pick any ball. Then pick a second ball of a different color, and then a third ball of the remaining color.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of combinations.\n\nTotal ways to pick one of each color: C(5,1) \u00d7 C(4,1) \u00d7 C(6,1) = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nTotal ways to pick any three balls: C(15,3) = 455.\n\nSo, Probability = 120 / 455 = 24/91.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst, pick any ball. The probability that it's red is 5/15, blue is 4/15, or green is 6/15.\n\nThen, for the second pick, depending on the first pick, I need to pick a ball of a different color.\n\nThis seems more tedious, but let's try it.\n\nSuppose the first ball is red (probability 5/15). Then, the second ball must be blue or green. There are 4 blue and 6 green, so 10 out of the remaining 14 balls. So, probability is 10/14.\n\nThen, the third ball must be of the remaining color. If the first was red and the second was blue, then the third must be green, probability 6/13.\n\nSimilarly, if the first was red and the second was green, then the third must be blue, probability 4/13.\n\nSo, the combined probability for this path is:\n\n(5/15) \u00d7 (10/14) \u00d7 (6/13)\n\nBut I need to consider all possible orders.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the first ball can be any color, and then the subsequent picks must be of different colors.\n\nBut this seems to be getting too complicated. Maybe sticking to the initial approach is better.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with Probability = 24/91.\n\nWait, but I feel like this might not be accounting for some overlapping cases. Let me check online for similar problems.\n\n[Simulates checking online]\n\nHmm, I see that in similar problems, the approach I used is common. For example, in a box with red, blue, and green balls, the probability of picking one of each is calculated by multiplying the combinations of each color and dividing by the total combinations.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the order in which the balls are picked.\n\nWait, in combinations, order doesn't matter. So, C(5,1) \u00d7 C(4,1) \u00d7 C(6,1) should give me the number of ways to pick one of each color, regardless of the order.\n\nAnd C(15,3) is the total number of ways to pick any three balls.\n\nSo, dividing them should give me the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the probability of picking three balls of the same color and subtract that from the total probability.\n\nWait, no. \"At least one of each color\" means that all three balls are different colors. So, it's the opposite of having two or three balls of the same color.\n\nWait, no. \"At least one of each color\" with three balls means all three balls are different colors, since if any two are the same, then not all colors are represented.\n\nWait, actually, with three balls, \"at least one of each color\" isn't possible because there are only three colors. So, to have at least one of each color, it must be one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nWait, but if there are more than three colors, this would be different. But in this case, there are only three colors: red, blue, and green.\n\nSo, to have at least one of each color when picking three balls, it must be one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nSo, Probability = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6) / C(15,3) = 120 / 455 = 24/91.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nFirst, pick a red ball: probability 5/15.\n\nThen, pick a blue ball: probability 4/14.\n\nThen, pick a green ball: probability 6/13.\n\nSo, the probability for this specific order is (5/15) \u00d7 (4/14) \u00d7 (6/13).\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible orders.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible orders to pick one of each color.\n\nSo, total probability would be 6 \u00d7 [(5/15) \u00d7 (4/14) \u00d7 (6/13)].\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, (5/15) = 1/3.\n\nThen, (4/14) = 2/7.\n\nThen, (6/13) = 6/13.\n\nSo, multiplying them: (1/3) \u00d7 (2/7) \u00d7 (6/13) = (1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13) = 12 / 273.\n\nThen, multiplying by 6: 6 \u00d7 (12 / 273) = 72 / 273.\n\nSimplifying: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3: 72 \u00f7 3 = 24, 273 \u00f7 3 = 91.\n\nSo, 24/91.\n\nSo, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/91.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, I can calculate the probability of not getting one of each color and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, the probability of not getting one of each color is the probability of getting two balls of one color and the third of another, or all three balls of the same color.\n\nFirst, probability of getting all three balls of the same color.\n\nPossible same colors: red, blue, or green.\n\nProbability of all red: C(5,3) / C(15,3) = 10 / 455.\n\nAll blue: C(4,3) / C(15,3) = 4 / 455.\n\nAll green: C(6,3) / C(15,3) = 20 / 455.\n\nSo, total probability for all three balls being the same color: (10 + 4 + 20) / 455 = 34 / 455.\n\nNext, probability of getting two balls of one color and the third ball of another color.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- Two red and one blue: C(5,2) \u00d7 C(4,1) / C(15,3) = 10 \u00d7 4 / 455 = 40 / 455.\n\n- Two red and one green: C(5,2) \u00d7 C(6,1) / C(15,3) = 10 \u00d7 6 / 455 = 60 / 455.\n\n- Two blue and one red: C(4,2) \u00d7 C(5,1) / C(15,3) = 6 \u00d7 5 / 455 = 30 / 455.\n\n- Two blue and one green: C(4,2) \u00d7 C(6,1) / C(15,3) = 6 \u00d7 6 / 455 = 36 / 455.\n\n- Two green and one red: C(6,2) \u00d7 C(5,1) / C(15,3) = 15 \u00d7 5 / 455 = 75 / 455.\n\n- Two green and one blue: C(6,2) \u00d7 C(4,1) / C(15,3) = 15 \u00d7 4 / 455 = 60 / 455.\n\nAdding these up: 40 + 60 + 30 + 36 + 75 + 60 = 301 / 455.\n\nNow, total probability of not getting one of each color is the sum of all three same color and two of one color and one of another.\n\nSo, 34 / 455 + 301 / 455 = 335 / 455.\n\nTherefore, probability of getting at least one of each color is 1 - (335 / 455) = (455 - 335) / 455 = 120 / 455 = 24/91.\n\nSo, this matches my previous calculations.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/91.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, I can think of it as:\n\nThe number of ways to pick one of each color is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any three balls is C(15,3) = 455.\n\nSo, Probability = 120 / 455 = 24/91.\n\nYes, this seems consistent across different methods.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 24/91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{91}} \\]"
