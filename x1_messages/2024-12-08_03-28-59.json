        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples in bags, and each bag contains 6 apples. So, if a customer buys 4 bags, that means they get 4 times 6 apples. Let me calculate that: 4 times 6 is 24 apples. Okay, so the customer has 24 apples initially.\n\nNow, the customer gives away 2 apples to their friend. So, I need to subtract those 2 apples from the total they have. That would be 24 minus 2, which equals 22 apples.\n\nTherefore, the customer has 22 apples left.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. They bought 4 bags, each with 6 apples, so 4 times 6 is indeed 24. Then, they give away 2 apples, so 24 minus 2 is 22. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if there are any additional apples or anything, but the question says they buy 4 bags and give away 2 apples. So, no, that's straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is 22 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
