        "content": "So there are 3 red balls and 5 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. You're picking one ball, looking at its color, putting it back, and then picking another ball. You want to know the probability of picking a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nFirst, since you're putting the ball back after the first pick, the two events are independent. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first pick is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 3/8.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball on the second pick is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/8.\n\nSince these are independent events, the probability of both events happening in sequence is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball first and then a blue ball is (3/8) * (5/8) = 15/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{64}} \\]"
