        "content": "To determine how long it will take for the car to reach its destination, we can use the formula for time, which is derived from the relationship between distance, speed, and time. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that the car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and needs to cover a distance of 240 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the car 4 hours to reach its destination, assuming it maintains an average speed of 60 miles per hour without any stops or changes in speed.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- **Traffic conditions:** In real-world scenarios, traffic can significantly affect travel time. Heavy traffic can increase the travel time beyond the calculated 4 hours.\n\n- **Rest stops:** If the driver plans to take breaks or rest stops, this will also add to the total travel time.\n\n- **Speed variations:** If the car's speed varies during the journey, the average speed might differ from the constant 60 miles per hour assumed in this calculation.\n\n- **Road conditions:** The condition of the road can affect the car's speed and, consequently, the travel time.\n\nHowever, based solely on the given information and assuming constant speed, the travel time is 4 hours."
