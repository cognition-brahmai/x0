An :evidence[n]: variable must be referenced in the input.\n\nFor each function, simply provide a plain string as input without quotation marks or \"+\" symbols for concatenating with an evidence variable (like InfoProcessor[What is the population of Tokyo, given :evidence1:?]).\n\nThe output should adhere to the following structure:\nPlan: [initial action]\n:evidence0: = [call to function with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action influenced by outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [call to next function with input parameter, possibly referring to earlier evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: where n represents the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who was the architect behind the construction of the Eiffel Tower and what other structures did they design?"
