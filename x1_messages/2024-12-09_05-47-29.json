Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n- **Light Absorption**: Photosynthesis starts when plants absorb light, usually from the sun, using a green pigment called chlorophyll found in their leaves.\n\n- **Water Uptake**: Plants take in water through their roots, which travels up to the leaves.\n\n- **Carbon Dioxide Intake**: Plants also take in carbon dioxide from the air through small openings in their leaves called stomata.\n\n- **Energy Conversion**: Using the energy from the sunlight, plants convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen.\n\n- **Glucose Usage**: The glucose is used by the plant as food for energy and growth.\n\n- **Oxygen Release**: The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released back into the air through the stomata.\n\nSo, in essence, photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, and in the process, they release oxygen which is essential for life on Earth."
