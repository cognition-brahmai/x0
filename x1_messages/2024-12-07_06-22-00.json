        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that in a certain country, half of the population lives in the capital city. Then, one quarter of the remaining population lives in the second largest city, and the rest, which is 18 million people, live elsewhere. We need to find the total population of the country.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total population of the country as P.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- Half of the population lives in the capital city: (1/2)P\n\n- One quarter of the remaining population lives in the second largest city.\n\n- The rest, which is 18 million, lives elsewhere.\n\nLet's find out what the remaining population is after accounting for those living in the capital city.\n\nRemaining population after capital city: P - (1/2)P = (1/2)P\n\nNow, one quarter of this remaining population lives in the second largest city:\n\n(1/4)(1/2)P = (1/8)P\n\nSo, the population in the second largest city is (1/8)P.\n\nNow, the rest of the population, which is 18 million, lives elsewhere. This rest would be the remaining population after subtracting those in the capital and the second largest city.\n\nSo, rest of the population = Total population - (Capital city population + Second city population)\n\nWhich is:\n\n18,000,000 = P - [(1/2)P + (1/8)P]\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\nFirst, combine the terms on the right:\n\n(1/2)P + (1/8)P = (4/8)P + (1/8)P = (5/8)P\n\nSo,\n\n18,000,000 = P - (5/8)P = (3/8)P\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\n(3/8)P = 18,000,000\n\nP = 18,000,000 / (3/8) = 18,000,000 * (8/3) = 48,000,000\n\nSo, the total population of the country is 48 million people.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf P = 48,000,000,\n\nThen, capital city population = (1/2)(48,000,000) = 24,000,000\n\nRemaining population = 48,000,000 - 24,000,000 = 24,000,000\n\nSecond city population = (1/4)(24,000,000) = 6,000,000\n\nRest of the population = 24,000,000 - 6,000,000 = 18,000,000, which matches the given information.\n\nSo, yes, the total population is indeed 48 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48000000} \\]"
