        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 120 cars in total, and 30% of them are electric. So first, I need to find out how many electric cars they currently have.\n\nTo find 30% of 120, I can calculate:\n\n\\[\n0.30 \\times 120 = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, they have 36 electric cars right now.\n\nNext, I need to determine how many cars would be electric if 50% of the fleet were electric. Again, I'll calculate 50% of 120:\n\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 120 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, they want to have 60 electric cars in total.\n\nNow, to find out how many more electric cars they need to reach this goal, I'll subtract the current number of electric cars from the desired number:\n\n\\[\n60 - 36 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, they need to add 24 more electric cars to make up 50% of their fleet.\n\nBut the question mentions \"replace with electric cars.\" So, I assume they are planning to replace some gasoline-powered cars with electric ones.\n\nCurrently, the number of gasoline-powered cars is:\n\n\\[\n120 - 36 = 84\n\\]\n\nIf they replace 24 gasoline-powered cars with electric ones, the number of electric cars will increase by 24, and the number of gasoline-powered cars will decrease by 24.\n\nLet me check:\n\nNew number of electric cars:\n\n\\[\n36 + 24 = 60\n\\]\n\nNew number of gasoline-powered cars:\n\n\\[\n84 - 24 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, indeed, 60 electric cars out of 120 total cars would be 50%.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says, \"how many more gasoline-powered cars would they need to replace with electric cars to make 50% of their fleet electric?\"\n\nI think I've answered that: 24.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up an equation.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of gasoline-powered cars to replace with electric ones.\n\nAfter replacing \\( x \\) cars, the number of electric cars will be:\n\n\\[\n36 + x\n\\]\n\nAnd the total number of cars remains 120.\n\nWe want the electric cars to be 50% of the fleet:\n\n\\[\n36 + x = 0.50 \\times 120\n\\]\n\n\\[\n36 + x = 60\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 60 - 36\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, again, \\( x = 24 \\).\n\nTherefore, they need to replace 24 gasoline-powered cars with electric cars to make 50% of their fleet electric.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
