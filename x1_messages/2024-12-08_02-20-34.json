        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: In a class of 30 students, 6 students wear glasses. I need to find out what proportion of the class wears glasses. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a proportion is. Proportion basically means the fraction of the whole that possesses a certain characteristic. In this case, the characteristic is wearing glasses.\n\nSo, the total number of students is 30, and out of these, 6 wear glasses. To find the proportion, I should divide the number of students who wear glasses by the total number of students.\n\nThat is, proportion = (number of students who wear glasses) / (total number of students).\n\nPlugging in the numbers, proportion = 6 / 30.\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 6.\n\n6 \u00f7 6 = 1\n\n30 \u00f7 6 = 5\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 1/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this proportion as a decimal. To do that, I can divide 1 by 5, which equals 0.2.\n\nAlternatively, proportions are sometimes expressed as percentages. To convert the decimal to a percentage, I can multiply by 100.\n\nSo, 0.2 \u00d7 100 = 20%.\n\nTherefore, the proportion of the class that wears glasses is 1/5, or 0.2, or 20%.\n\nBut since the question asks for the proportion, I think the most appropriate way to express it is as a fraction, which is 1/5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Proportion can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage, but in mathematical terms, fraction is often the preferred form unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the fraction is in its simplest form. Earlier, I simplified 6/30 to 1/5, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could cross-validate this by using another method. For example, if 6 out of 30 students wear glasses, then for every 30 students, 6 wear glasses. To find out how many would wear glasses out of 1 student, I can set up a proportion:\n\n6/30 = x/1\n\nSolving for x, x = 6/30 = 1/5.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of students who wear glasses to the total number of students, which is indeed 6:30, which simplifies to 1:5.\n\nTherefore, the proportion is 1/5.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\nIs there any possibility that some students wear more than one pair of glasses or something like that? Nah, that seems unlikely. The question is pretty straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the class includes teachers or other staff, but the question specifies \"a class of 30 students,\" so I think it's safe to assume that only students are included.\n\nAlso, the question is about proportions, not about probabilities or anything else, so I don't need to delve into more complex statistical concepts.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}} \\]"
