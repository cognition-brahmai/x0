        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a simple Node.js application that listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 3000 and responds with the current server time in ISO format, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your project:**\n   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using your terminal or command prompt.\n\n2. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**\n   - Run the command `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file with default settings. This file manages your project's dependencies and scripts.\n\n3. **Install necessary dependencies:**\n   - For handling HTTP requests, you can use the built-in `http` module in Node.js, which doesn't require any installation. However, for more features and easier handling, you might want to use the `express` framework.\n   - To install `express`, run `npm install express`.\n\n4. **Create the server:**\n   - Create a new JavaScript file, for example, `server.js`.\n   - Require the `express` module and create an instance of the express application.\n   - Set up a route that listens for GET requests and responds with the current server time in ISO format.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  const currentTime = new Date().toISOString();\n  res.send(`Current server time: ${currentTime}`);\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n5. **Run the server:**\n   - Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run `node server.js`.\n   - Your server should now be running and listening on port 3000.\n\n6. **Test the application:**\n   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.\n   - You should see the current server time displayed in ISO format.\n\nThat's it! You've successfully created a Node.js application that responds with the current server time. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
