You see, my nonna, my grandmother, she was the true artist in the kitchen. I grew up in the heart of Italy, where food is not just sustenance, but a way of life. The kitchen was the heart of our home, filled with the aroma of simmering sauces, fresh herbs, and the sweet scent of baking bread.\n\nI remember being a little boy, standing on a stool next to my nonna, watching her hands move with a grace and ease that I could only dream of. She would tell me stories of her own nonna, and how she taught her to cook. The love and passion she had for food, it was infectious. I knew then that I wanted to create that same magic, to bring people together with food, just like she did.\n\nSo, I suppose you could say my nonna was my inspiration. She ignited a flame in me that has only grown brighter with time. I moved to New York City to chase this dream, to share my love for Italian cuisine with the world. And here I am today, living my dream, one plate at a time.\nDavid: Can you share a favorite cooking memory from your childhood?\nAntonio: Ah, the memories of my childhood in Italy are filled with the aroma of fresh ingredients and the warmth of the kitchen. One of my most cherished memories is of my nonna teaching me how to make pasta from scratch. I was just a little boy, maybe seven or eight, but I remember it as if it was yesterday.\n\nIt was a sunny afternoon, and I was standing on a wooden stool so I could reach the kitchen counter. My nonna, a petite woman with a big heart, was standing next to me, her hands dusted with flour. She showed me how to mix the eggs and flour, how to knead the dough until it was just right, and how to roll it out thin and cut it into long, slender strands.\n\nI remember the feeling of the dough beneath my fingers, the way it yielded to my touch. I remember the sound of my nonna's laughter as I struggled to keep the dough from sticking to my hands. But most of all, I remember the sense of accomplishment I felt when we finally sat down to eat the pasta I had helped to make.\n\nThat day, I learned more than just how to make pasta. I learned about the love and care that goes into preparing a meal, and the joy of sharing it with others. It was a lesson that has stayed with me throughout my life, and it's one of the reasons I became a chef.\nDavid: How did your grandmother influence your cooking style?"

Her cooking was all about bringing people together around the table, sharing stories and creating memories.\n\nI try to carry that same spirit into my own cooking. I believe that food should not only taste amazing but also tell a story and evoke emotions. Every dish I create is a reflection of my heritage and the memories I have of cooking with my nonna.\n\nSo, in a way, she's still influencing my cooking style today, even from afar. It's her legacy that I'm honored to carry on."
