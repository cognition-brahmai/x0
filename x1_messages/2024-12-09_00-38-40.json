        "content": "So the logistics company is planning to expand its fleet by buying 50 new trucks over the next five years. Each truck costs $150,000 initially and has an annual maintenance cost of $10,000. They expect each truck to generate additional revenue of $200,000 per year. We need to calculate the total investment required for this expansion and the expected return on investment (ROI) after five years, considering a 3% annual inflation rate on both costs and revenues.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n1. **Calculate the total initial investment for the trucks.**\n\n2. **Calculate the annual maintenance costs over five years, adjusted for inflation.**\n\n3. **Calculate the total additional revenue generated over five years, adjusted for inflation.**\n\n4. **Calculate the total investment by adding the initial investment and the total maintenance costs.**\n\n5. **Calculate the net profit by subtracting the total investment from the total revenue.**\n\n6. **Calculate the ROI using the net profit and the total investment.**\n\nLet's start with the first step.\n\n**1. Total initial investment for the trucks:**\n\nEach truck costs $150,000, and they're buying 50 trucks.\n\nTotal initial investment = 50 trucks * $150,000/truck = $7,500,000.\n\n**2. Annual maintenance costs over five years, adjusted for inflation:**\n\nThe annual maintenance cost per truck is $10,000, and there are 50 trucks.\n\nSo, annual maintenance cost without inflation = 50 trucks * $10,000/truck = $500,000.\n\nNow, we need to account for a 3% annual inflation rate on the maintenance costs.\n\nTo find the total maintenance cost over five years with inflation, we can calculate the maintenance cost for each year and then sum them up.\n\nLet's denote the maintenance cost in year t as MC_t.\n\nMC_1 = $500,000 * (1 + 0.03)^0 = $500,000\n\nMC_2 = $500,000 * (1 + 0.03)^1 = $500,000 * 1.03 = $515,000\n\nMC_3 = $500,000 * (1 + 0.03)^2 = $500,000 * 1.0609 = $530,450\n\nMC_4 = $500,000 * (1 + 0.03)^3 = $500,000 * 1.092727 = $546,363.50\n\nMC_5 = $500,000 * (1 + 0.03)^4 = $500,000 * 1.125509 = $562,754.50\n\nNow, sum these up to get the total maintenance cost over five years:\n\nTotal maintenance cost = MC_1 + MC_2 + MC_3 + MC_4 + MC_5\n\n= $500,000 + $515,000 + $530,450 + $546,363.50 + $562,754.50\n\n= $2,654,568\n\n**3. Total additional revenue generated over five years, adjusted for inflation:**\n\nEach truck generates $200,000 per year, and there are 50 trucks.\n\nSo, annual revenue without inflation = 50 trucks * $200,000/truck = $10,000,000.\n\nNow, we need to account for a 3% annual inflation rate on the revenue.\n\nSimilarly, we'll calculate the revenue for each year and sum them up.\n\nLet's denote the revenue in year t as R_t.\n\nR_1 = $10,000,000 * (1 + 0.03)^0 = $10,000,000\n\nR_2 = $10,000,000 * (1 + 0.03)^1 = $10,000,000 * 1.03 = $10,300,000\n\nR_3 = $10,000,000 * (1 + 0.03)^2 = $10,000,000 * 1.0609 = $10,609,000\n\nR_4 = $10,000,000 * (1 + 0.03)^3 = $10,000,000 * 1.092727 = $10,927,270\n\nR_5 = $10,000,000 * (1 + 0.03)^4 = $10,000,000 * 1.125509 = $11,255,090\n\nNow, sum these up to get the total revenue over five years:\n\nTotal revenue = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 + R_5\n\n= $10,000,000 + $10,300,000 + $10,609,000 + $10,927,270 + $11,255,090\n\n= $53,091,360\n\n**4. Total investment:**\n\nTotal investment = initial investment + total maintenance costs\n\n= $7,500,000 + $2,654,568\n\n= $10,154,568\n\n**5. Net profit:**\n\nNet profit = total revenue - total investment\n\n= $53,091,360 - $10,154,568\n\n= $42,936,792\n\n**6. ROI:**\n\nROI is calculated as (net profit / total investment) * 100%\n\nROI = ($42,936,792 / $10,154,568) * 100% \u2248 422.83%\n\nWait a minute, that seems too high. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the initial investment is correct: 50 trucks * $150,000 = $7,500,000.\n\nAnnual maintenance cost without inflation is 50 trucks * $10,000 = $500,000.\n\nNow, applying the inflation rate to the maintenance costs:\n\nMC_1 = $500,000\n\nMC_2 = $500,000 * 1.03 = $515,000\n\nMC_3 = $500,000 * 1.03^2 = $500,000 * 1.0609 = $530,450\n\nMC_4 = $500,000 * 1.03^3 = $500,000 * 1.092727 = $546,363.50\n\nMC_5 = $500,000 * 1.03^4 = $500,000 * 1.125509 = $562,754.50\n\nTotal maintenance cost = $500,000 + $515,000 + $530,450 + $546,363.50 + $562,754.50 = $2,654,568\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, for the revenue:\n\nAnnual revenue without inflation = 50 trucks * $200,000 = $10,000,000\n\nApplying inflation:\n\nR_1 = $10,000,000\n\nR_2 = $10,000,000 * 1.03 = $10,300,000\n\nR_3 = $10,000,000 * 1.03^2 = $10,609,000\n\nR_4 = $10,000,000 * 1.03^3 = $10,927,270\n\nR_5 = $10,000,000 * 1.03^4 = $11,255,090\n\nTotal revenue = $10,000,000 + $10,300,000 + $10,609,000 + $10,927,270 + $11,255,090 = $53,091,360\n\nTotal investment = $7,500,000 + $2,654,568 = $10,154,568\n\nNet profit = $53,091,360 - $10,154,568 = $42,936,792\n\nROI = ($42,936,792 / $10,154,568) * 100% \u2248 422.83%\n\nHmm, that does seem high, but the calculations seem correct. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the revenue and costs are both adjusted for inflation, so in real terms, the purchasing power remains the same. But the problem asks to consider a 3% annual inflation rate on both costs and revenues, so I think adjusting both for inflation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the time value of money and discount future cash flows back to present value using a discount rate, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks to calculate the total investment and expected ROI after five years, considering inflation on costs and revenues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ROI should be calculated based on the net present value or something like that, but again, the problem doesn't specify.\n\nGiven that, I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nTotal investment needed: $10,154,568\n\nExpected return on investment (ROI) after five years: approximately 422.83%\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{422.83\\%} \\]"
