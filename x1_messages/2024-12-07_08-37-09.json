        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory produces 500 units of product X every hour. It operates for 16 hours a day, 5 days a week. We need to find out how many units it produces in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's find out the daily production. If the factory produces 500 units per hour and operates for 16 hours a day, then the daily production is:\n\n500 units/hour * 16 hours/day = 8,000 units/day\n\nNext, let's calculate the weekly production. Since the factory operates 5 days a week, the weekly production would be:\n\n8,000 units/day * 5 days/week = 40,000 units/week\n\nNow, to find the production over 4 weeks, we simply multiply the weekly production by 4:\n\n40,000 units/week * 4 weeks = 160,000 units\n\nSo, the factory produces 160,000 units of product X in 4 weeks.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, perhaps there are leap years or something affecting the number of days, but the problem seems to specify a regular operation schedule without considering leap years or holidays. So, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of hours the factory operates in 4 weeks and then multiply by the hourly production rate.\n\nFirst, find the total number of hours per week:\n\n16 hours/day * 5 days/week = 80 hours/week\n\nThen, for 4 weeks:\n\n80 hours/week * 4 weeks = 320 hours\n\nNow, multiply the total hours by the hourly production:\n\n500 units/hour * 320 hours = 160,000 units\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about it in terms of units per week and then multiply by 4, which is what I did initially.\n\nEither way, the answer remains the same.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. If there were any additional factors, such as the factory operating at different rates on different days or having downtime, we'd need to adjust accordingly. But based on the information provided, this seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160000} \\]"
