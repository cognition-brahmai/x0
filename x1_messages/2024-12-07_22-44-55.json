        "content": "So the stadium is planning to replace its seats to make them more comfortable and spacious, which sounds like a good idea. But this change will reduce the seating capacity by 15%, and at the same time, they're planning to increase ticket prices by 25%. They currently have a seating capacity of 60,000 spectators. I need to calculate the new seating capacity and see how this will affect their revenue if they operate at full capacity.\n\nFirst, let's find out what the new seating capacity will be after a 15% reduction.\n\nCurrent seating capacity = 60,000\n\nReduction = 15% of 60,000\n\nTo calculate 15% of 60,000:\n\n(15/100) * 60,000 = 0.15 * 60,000 = 9,000\n\nSo, the seating capacity will be reduced by 9,000 seats.\n\nNew seating capacity = 60,000 - 9,000 = 51,000 spectators\n\nNext, I need to consider the increase in ticket prices. They're increasing prices by 25%.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the current ticket price is P. Then, the new ticket price will be:\n\nNew ticket price = P + (25% of P) = P + 0.25P = 1.25P\n\nNow, to calculate the revenue, we multiply the number of tickets sold by the price per ticket.\n\nCurrent revenue (at full capacity):\n\nCurrent revenue = 60,000 * P\n\nNew revenue (at new full capacity):\n\nNew revenue = 51,000 * 1.25P\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n51,000 * 1.25P = 63,750P\n\nNow, to find the potential change in revenue, we subtract the current revenue from the new revenue:\n\nChange in revenue = New revenue - Current revenue = 63,750P - 60,000P = 3,750P\n\nSo, the potential change in revenue is an increase of 3,750P, where P is the current ticket price.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe there's a percentage increase in revenue that we can calculate.\n\nFirst, let's find the revenue multiplication factor.\n\nThe seating capacity is reduced by 15%, so that's 85% of the original capacity.\n\nThe price is increased by 25%, which is 125% of the original price.\n\nSo, the new revenue as a percentage of the old revenue is:\n\n85% * 125% = 0.85 * 1.25 = 1.0625 or 106.25%\n\nSo, the new revenue is 106.25% of the old revenue, which means a 6.25% increase.\n\nWait a minute, this seems different from what I calculated earlier.\n\nEarlier, I had a increase of 3,750P, which\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e original revenue of 60,000P, is:\n\n(3,750P / 60,000P) * 100% = (3,750 / 60,000) * 100% = 6.25%\n\nSo, both methods give the same result: a 6.25% increase in revenue.\n\nTherefore, the new seating capacity is 51,000 spectators, and the potential change in revenue is an increase of 6.25%, assuming the stadium operates at full capacity.\n\nIt's important to note that this calculation assumes that all other factors remain constant, such as the number of events, demand for tickets, etc. In reality, there might be other factors that could affect revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{New seating capacity: } 51,000 \\text{ spectators; Potential revenue increase: } 6.25\\%} \\]"
