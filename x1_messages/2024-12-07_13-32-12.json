        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces widgets at a rate of 1000 per hour. First, I need to figure out how many widgets are produced in an 8-hour shift.\n\nProducing 1000 widgets per hour for 8 hours would be:\n\n1000 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 8000 widgets\n\nSo, the factory produces 8000 widgets in an 8-hour shift.\n\nNow, the next part is about packaging. It says that it takes 2 hours to package every 500 widgets. I need to find out how long it will take to package all 8000 widgets.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many batches of 500 widgets there are in 8000 widgets.\n\n8000 widgets \u00f7 500 widgets/batch = 16 batches\n\nEach batch takes 2 hours to package, so for 16 batches, it would be:\n\n16 batches \u00d7 2 hours/batch = 32 hours\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider if packaging can happen simultaneously with production or if there are any overlapping processes.\n\nThe problem says that the factory produces widgets at a certain rate and takes a certain time to package them. It doesn't specify if packaging happens simultaneously or sequentially. I think I should assume that packaging starts after production is complete, unless stated otherwise.\n\nGiven that, if the factory produces 8000 widgets in 8 hours and then takes 32 hours to package them, the total time would be the sum of both activities.\n\nBut perhaps packaging can happen at the same time as production. Let's think about that.\n\nIf production is ongoing, and packaging starts after every 500 widgets are produced, then perhaps there's an overlap.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"it takes 2 hours to package every 500 widgets.\" It doesn't specify when the packaging starts. If packaging starts only after all widgets are produced, then the total time is production time plus packaging time.\n\nBut if packaging can happen while production is still going on, then maybe the total time is less.\n\nTo clarify, let's consider two scenarios:\n\n1. Sequential: First, produce all widgets, then package them.\n\n2. Concurrent: Production and packaging happen at the same time.\n\nFirst, let's consider the sequential approach.\n\n**Sequential Approach:**\n\n- Production time: 8 hours (to produce 8000 widgets)\n\n- Packaging time: 32 hours (to package 8000 widgets)\n\n- Total time: 8 hours + 32 hours = 40 hours\n\nBut this seems inefficient, and perhaps not what is intended.\n\nNow, let's consider the concurrent approach.\n\n**Concurrent Approach:**\n\n- Production is happening at 1000 widgets per hour.\n\n- Packaging starts as soon as 500 widgets are produced.\n\n- Every 0.5 hours, 500 widgets are produced (since 1000 per hour).\n\n- Packaging takes 2 hours for each 500 widgets.\n\nWait, that seems tricky. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of rates.\n\nProduction rate: 1000 widgets per hour.\n\nPackaging rate: 500 widgets every 2 hours, which is 250 widgets per hour.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nPackaging rate: 500 widgets / 2 hours = 250 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, production is 1000 per hour, packaging is 250 per hour.\n\nNet increase in unpackaged widgets: 1000 - 250 = 750 widgets per hour.\n\nIn an 8-hour shift:\n\nTotal produced: 1000 \u00d7 8 = 8000 widgets\n\nTotal packaged: 250 \u00d7 8 = 2000 widgets\n\nUnpackaged widgets: 8000 - 2000 = 6000 widgets\n\nNow, after the 8-hour shift, we have 6000 unpackaged widgets. To package these, at 250 widgets per hour, it would take:\n\n6000 widgets / 250 widgets per hour = 24 hours\n\nTherefore, total time is 8 hours (shift) + 24 hours (packaging) = 32 hours\n\nWait, earlier I got 40 hours, but now it's 32 hours. Which one is correct?\n\nI think there's confusion because in the concurrent approach, packaging is happening simultaneously with production, so the 8-hour shift includes both production and some packaging.\n\nBut after the shift is over, additional time is needed to package the remaining widgets.\n\nSo, total time is the shift time plus the additional packaging time for the remaining widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total time is determined by the longer of production time or packaging time.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the time when both production and packaging are occurring simultaneously.\n\nLet me try to visualize this with a timeline.\n\n- From time 0 to 8 hours: production is happening at 1000 widgets per hour, and packaging is happening at 250 widgets per hour.\n\n- So, the net increase in widgets is 750 per hour.\n\n- After 8 hours, the total unpackaged widgets are 750 \u00d7 8 = 6000 widgets.\n\n- Then, after production stops, packaging continues at 250 per hour.\n\n- To package 6000 widgets: 6000 / 250 = 24 hours.\n\n- Therefore, total time is 8 hours + 24 hours = 32 hours.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the packaging time required for all widgets produced.\n\nTotal widgets: 8000\n\nPackaging rate: 250 per hour\n\nTotal packaging time: 8000 / 250 = 32 hours\n\nBut wait, during the 8-hour shift, packaging is also happening, so perhaps it's not that simple.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider the total amount of packaging work needed.\n\nTotal widgets produced: 8000\n\nEach 500 widgets require 2 hours of packaging.\n\nNumber of 500-widget batches: 8000 / 500 = 16 batches\n\nEach batch takes 2 hours to package, so total packaging time required is 16 \u00d7 2 = 32 hours\n\nNow, if packaging can happen simultaneously with production, then the total time is the maximum of production time and packaging time.\n\nProduction time is 8 hours, packaging time is 32 hours, so total time is 32 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if packaging can only happen after production is complete, then total time is 8 hours plus 32 hours, which is 40 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I need to think about the overlapping of packaging during production.\n\nLet me try to calculate the amount of packaging that can be done during the 8-hour shift.\n\nPackaging rate: 250 widgets per hour\n\nIn 8 hours: 250 \u00d7 8 = 2000 widgets packaged\n\nTotal widgets produced: 8000\n\nUnpackaged widgets after 8 hours: 8000 - 2000 = 6000\n\nNow, to package the remaining 6000 widgets at 250 per hour: 6000 / 250 = 24 hours\n\nTherefore, total time is 8 hours + 24 hours = 32 hours\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more efficient way to schedule packaging and production.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems that 32 hours is the time required to package all widgets produced in an 8-hour shift, assuming packaging starts simultaneously with production.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the packaging time per widget.\n\nPackaging rate: 2 hours per 500 widgets, which is 0.004 hours per widget.\n\nWait, 2 hours per 500 widgets is 2/500 = 0.004 hours per widget.\n\nProduction rate: 1000 widgets per hour, which is 1/1000 hours per widget.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the packaging time required per unit of production time.\n\nFor every hour of production, 1000 widgets are produced, which would require packaging time.\n\nGiven that packaging takes 2 hours for every 500 widgets, which is 4 hours of packaging per 1000 widgets produced.\n\nSo, for each hour of production, an additional 4 hours of packaging are required.\n\nBut that can't be right, because that would mean for an 8-hour shift, packaging time would be 8 hours \u00d7 4 = 32 hours, which aligns with my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, total time is 8 hours (production) + 32 hours (packaging) = 40 hours\n\nWait, but earlier I considered that packaging can happen simultaneously with production, reducing the total time to 32 hours.\n\nI need to resolve this confusion.\n\nLet me look up how to handle such problems.\n\nIn manufacturing, production and packaging can often be concurrent processes, especially if there is a separate packaging line.\n\nAssuming that packaging starts as soon as there are widgets to package and continues until all widgets are packaged.\n\nIf production and packaging are happening at the same time, then the total time would be determined by the longer of the two processes.\n\nBut in this case, packaging is slower than production, so packaging will take longer.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\n- Production stops after 8 hours, having produced 8000 widgets.\n\n- Packaging continues at 250 widgets per hour until all 8000 are packaged.\n\n- Time required for packaging: 8000 / 250 = 32 hours\n\n- Therefore, total time from start of production to end of packaging is 32 hours.\n\nBut during those 32 hours, the first 8 hours are used for both production and packaging, and the remaining 24 hours are only for packaging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total time is 32 hours, during which the first 8 hours are used for production and packaging, and the next 24 hours are for packaging only.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total time required is 32 hours.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we have a timeline:\n\n- From time 0 to 8 hours:\n\n- Production: 1000 widgets per hour\n\n- Packaging: 250 widgets per hour\n\n- Net production: 1000 - 250 = 750 widgets per hour\n\n- Total widgets at time 8 hours: 750 \u00d7 8 = 6000 widgets\n\n- From time 8 to 32 hours:\n\n- Production: 0 (since production has stopped)\n\n- Packaging: 250 widgets per hour\n\n- Net change: -250 widgets per hour\n\n- Time to package 6000 widgets: 6000 / 250 = 24 hours\n\n- Therefore, total time is 8 + 24 = 32 hours\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for every hour of production, an additional 4 hours of packaging are required (as calculated earlier), but that would suggest a total of 8 hours production + 32 hours packaging = 40 hours, which contradicts the previous calculation.\n\nI need to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the discrepancy lies in how I'm accounting for the simultaneous packaging during production.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered that during the 8-hour shift, packaging is happening at the same time as production, reducing the net production rate.\n\nIn the second approach, I treated packaging as an additional time on top of the production time.\n\nI think the first approach is more accurate because packaging can happen concurrently with production.\n\nTherefore, the total time is 32 hours.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose we have a certain number of packaging units working in parallel.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify the number of packaging units, so I'll assume that packaging is a single process.\n\nGiven that, and considering that packaging is much slower than production, it makes sense that packaging will take significantly longer.\n\nTherefore, the total time required to package all widgets produced in an 8-hour shift is 32 hours.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more efficient way to schedule packaging.\n\nWait, maybe multiple packaging processes are happening simultaneously.\n\nThe problem states \"it takes 2 hours to package every 500 widgets,\" but it doesn't specify if this is for a single packaging line or overall.\n\nIf there are multiple packaging lines, then the packaging rate could be higher.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume a single packaging process.\n\nTherefore, the total time required is 32 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet's consider the rate at which widgets are being produced and packaged.\n\nProduction rate: 1000 widgets per hour\n\nPackaging rate: 250 widgets per hour\n\nNet increase in widgets: 750 per hour\n\nAfter 8 hours: 750 \u00d7 8 = 6000 widgets\n\nTime to package 6000 widgets: 6000 / 250 = 24 hours\n\nTotal time: 8 + 24 = 32 hours\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the packaging time is not purely additive, but overlapping.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the time it takes for the last batch to be packaged.\n\nIf production stops after 8 hours, and there are 8000 widgets to package, at 250 per hour, it's 32 hours.\n\nBut during the production time, some packaging is already happening.\n\nSo, perhaps the total time is maximized by the time it takes to package the last batch.\n\nLet me consider the timing:\n\n- At time 0: production starts\n\n- Every 0.5 hours, 500 widgets are produced (since 1000 per hour)\n\n- Packaging starts for each batch of 500 widgets, taking 2 hours\n\nIf packaging starts immediately for each batch, then the first batch starts packaging at time 0.5 hours and finishes at time 2.5 hours.\n\nThe second batch starts packaging at time 1 hour and finishes at time 3 hours.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAfter 8 hours of production, the last batch is produced at time 8 hours.\n\nPackaging for this batch starts at time 8 hours and finishes at time 10 hours.\n\nHowever, since production stops at 8 hours, packaging continues until the last batch is packaged.\n\nBut this seems messy, and perhaps not the intended approach.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll stick with the initial calculation that the total time is 32 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 32 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
