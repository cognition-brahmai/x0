        "content": "Let's see. There are 200 cars in total, and they're divided into compact, midsize, and full-size in the ratio of 3:2:1. So, that means for every 3 compact cars, there are 2 midsize and 1 full-size car.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this ratio means. The ratio 3:2:1 means that the total number of parts is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 parts. So, the whole fleet of 200 cars is divided into 6 parts.\n\nTo find out how many cars are in each part, I can divide the total number of cars by the total number of parts. So, 200 divided by 6. Let me do that calculation.\n\n200 \u00f7 6 = 33.333... Oh, that's a repeating decimal. That means each part is approximately 33.33 cars, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a car.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think of it in terms of multiples. Let's say each part is x cars. Then, compact cars would be 3x, midsize would be 2x, and full-size would be x. The total would be 3x + 2x + x = 6x, and we know that 6x = 200.\n\nSo, x = 200 / 6 = 100 / 3 \u2248 33.333. So, compact cars are 3 * (100 / 3) = 100, midsize are 2 * (100 / 3) \u2248 66.666, and full-size are 1 * (100 / 3) \u2248 33.333.\n\nBut again, we can't have a fraction of a car. Maybe the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number. So, compact would be 100, midsize 67, and full-size 33. Let's check if that adds up to 200.\n\n100 + 67 + 33 = 200. Yes, that works. So, the agency has 100 compact cars, 67 midsize cars, and 33 full-size cars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects exact divisions, but since 200 isn't divisible by 6, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the ratio might not be strictly 3:2:1, but approximately so, given that the total doesn't divide evenly. So, perhaps the numbers should be as close as possible to the ratio while adding up to 200.\n\nIn that case, let's set up equations. Let c be the number of compact cars, m be midsize, and f be full-size. We have:\n\nc + m + f = 200\n\nAnd the ratios:\n\nc/m = 3/2\n\nm/f = 2/1\n\nFrom c/m = 3/2, we get c = (3/2)m\n\nFrom m/f = 2/1, we get f = m/2\n\nNow, substitute these into the total equation:\n\n(3/2)m + m + (m/2) = 200\n\nLet's combine like terms:\n\n(3/2)m + m + (1/2)m = 200\n\nConvert m to (2/2)m to have a common denominator:\n\n(3/2)m + (2/2)m + (1/2)m = 200\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n(3/2 + 2/2 + 1/2)m = 200\n\n(6/2)m = 200\n\n3m = 200\n\nm = 200 / 3 \u2248 66.666\n\nThen, c = (3/2)*66.666 \u2248 100\n\nf = 66.666 / 2 \u2248 33.333\n\nAgain, we get the same fractional values. So, perhaps the agency has 100 compact cars, 67 midsize cars, and 33 full-size cars, rounding to whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the agency has 100 compact cars, 66 midsize cars, and 34 full-size cars, to make the total 200.\n\nBut then the ratio wouldn't be exactly 3:2:1. Let's check the ratios with these numbers.\n\nCompact:midsize:full-size = 100:66:34\n\nLet's divide each by the greatest common divisor. First, find the GCD of 100, 66, and 34.\n\nGCD of 100 and 66 is 2, and GCD of 2 and 34 is 2. So, divide each by 2:\n\n50:33:17\n\nThat's not equal to 3:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, if we take 100:67:33\n\nGCD of 100, 67, and 33. 67 is a prime number, and 33 is 3*11, so GCD is 1.\n\nSo, 100:67:33 cannot be simplified further, and it's not equal to 3:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for some flexibility in the ratio to make the numbers work out to whole cars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to leave the answer in fractions, but that doesn't make practical sense for counting cars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of cars is supposed to be divisible by the sum of the ratio parts, which is 6, but 200 isn't divisible by 6. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is approximate, and the agency has numbers close to the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the agency has 100 compact, 66 midsize, and 34 full-size cars. Let's check the total: 100 + 66 + 34 = 200.\n\nAnd the ratios:\n\nCompact:midsize:full-size = 100:66:34\n\nWhich simplifies to approximately 3.03:1.98:1.02, which is close to 3:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, if we have 100 compact, 67 midsize, and 33 full-size:\n\n100:67:33 \u2248 3.03:2.03:1, which is also close to 3:2:1.\n\nSo, perhaps either combination is acceptable, depending on how strictly the ratio is enforced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to express the numbers in terms of the ratio, even if they're not whole numbers, but that doesn't make sense for counting cars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the agency has 100 compact, 67 midsize, and 33 full-size cars, recognizing that the ratios aren't exact but are as close as possible given the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the agency has 100 compact, 66 midsize, and 34 full-size cars, which also adds up to 200.\n\nIn conclusion, given the constraints, the agency likely has approximately 100 compact cars, 67 midsize cars, and 33 full-size cars, or 100 compact, 66 midsize, and 34 full-size cars, depending on how the numbers are rounded.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ compact},\\ 67 \\text{ midsize},\\ 33 \\text{ full-size}} \\]"
