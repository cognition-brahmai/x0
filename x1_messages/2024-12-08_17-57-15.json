        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to create a simple ATM simulation using C#. I've never actually built an ATM system before, but I think I can figure it out. I'll start by planning out what I need.\n\nFirst, I need to have a way to store the user's pin and account balance. Since this is a simple simulation, I'll just hardcode these values for now. Maybe later I can think about making it more flexible.\n\nSo, I'll define some variables:\n\n- `int pin` to store the correct pin.\n\n- `double balance` to store the account balance.\n\nI need to accept a pin from the user and check if it's correct. If it is, I'll show them some options: balance enquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit money, and change pin. Each option will have its own functionality.\n\nLet me think about the flow:\n\n1. Ask for the pin.\n\n2. Validate the pin.\n\n3. If correct, show a menu with options.\n\n4. Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding action.\n\n5. After each action, ask if they want to do something else or exit.\n\nI should also handle invalid inputs and errors, like incorrect pin, insufficient balance, etc.\n\nOkay, starting with the pin validation:\n\nI'll hardcode the correct pin, say 1234, and the initial balance, say 1000.0.\n\nI need to read the pin from the user and compare it. If it's wrong, I'll show an error message and maybe give them a few tries before exiting.\n\nNow, for the menu:\n\nI can display a list of options and ask the user to enter a number corresponding to their choice.\n\nFor balance enquiry, it's simple: just display the current balance.\n\nFor cash withdrawal:\n\n- Ask how much they want to withdraw.\n\n- Check if the amount is less than or equal to the balance.\n\n- Deduct the amount from the balance.\n\nFor deposit money:\n\n- Ask how much they want to deposit.\n\n- Add the amount to the balance.\n\nFor change pin:\n\n- Ask the user to enter the new pin.\n\n- Confirm the new pin.\n\n- Update the pin.\n\nI should also make sure that the new pin is different from the old one and maybe enforce some pin complexity rules, but for simplicity, I'll skip that for now.\n\nLet me think about the user interface. Since it's a console application, I need to use `Console.ReadLine()` to get inputs and `Console.WriteLine()` to display outputs.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values for pin or amounts. I need to make sure that the program doesn't crash in such scenarios.\n\nMaybe I can use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions when converting strings to integers or doubles.\n\nAlright, let's start writing some code.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the console application and define the main method.\n\nThen, I'll declare the variables for pin and balance.\n\nLet me hardcode the pin as 1234 and balance as 1000.0.\n\nNow, I'll write a loop for pin validation. Maybe give the user 3 attempts to enter the correct pin.\n\nInside the loop, I'll read the pin from the user and compare it to the correct pin.\n\nIf it's correct, I'll break out of the loop and proceed to the menu.\n\nIf it's wrong, I'll display an error message and repeat the loop until all attempts are used.\n\nIf all attempts are wrong, I'll exit the program.\n\nOnce the pin is correct, I'll show the menu.\n\nI'll display options like:\n\n1. Balance Enquiry\n\n2. Cash Withdrawal\n\n3. Deposit Money\n\n4. Change Pin\n\n5. Exit\n\nThen, I'll read the user's choice and based on that, perform the corresponding action.\n\nI'll need to use switch cases for this.\n\nFor each option:\n\n- Balance Enquiry: just display the balance.\n\n- Cash Withdrawal: ask for the amount, check if it's less than or equal to the balance, deduct it if yes, else show an error.\n\n- Deposit Money: ask for the amount, add it to the balance.\n\n- Change Pin: ask for the new pin, confirm it, update the pin.\n\nAfter each action, I'll ask if the user wants to perform another transaction or exit.\n\nIf they choose to continue, I'll loop back to the menu; otherwise, exit.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user enters invalid choices, like a number outside the range of options.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the code.\n\nI can use methods for each functionality to keep the code organized.\n\nFor example, have a method for pin validation, another for displaying the menu, one for balance enquiry, etc.\n\nBut since it's a simple program, maybe it's overkill. I'll keep it straightforward for now.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure:\n\n- Declare pin and balance.\n\n- Pin validation loop:\n\n- Read pin.\n\n- Check if correct.\n\n- If correct, proceed to menu.\n\n- If wrong, display error and repeat until attempts finish.\n\n- Menu loop:\n\n- Display options.\n\n- Read choice.\n\n- Perform action based on choice.\n\n- Ask to continue or exit.\n\nNow, think about data types.\n\nPin is a number, so I'll use int.\n\nBalance is a decimal value, so I'll use double.\n\nAmounts for withdrawal and deposit will also be double.\n\nFor pin, some people use strings to allow for leading zeros, but for simplicity, I'll use int.\n\nI need to make sure that the pin entered by the user is numeric.\n\nIn C#, `Console.ReadLine()` returns a string, so I'll need to convert it to int.\n\nI'll use `int.Parse()` or `int.TryParse()` for this.\n\nIt's better to use `TryParse` to handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values.\n\nSimilarly, for amounts, I'll use `double.TryParse()`.\n\nAlright, let's start writing some code.\n\nFirst, create a new C# console application.\n\nThen, in the `Main` method, declare the variables:\n\nint correctPin = 1234;\n\ndouble balance = 1000.0;\n\nint maxAttempts = 3;\n\nint attempts = 0;\n\nbool isPinCorrect = false;\n\nThen, write a loop for pin validation:\n\nwhile (attempts < maxAttempts && !isPinCorrect)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter your pin: \");\n\nstring pinInput = Console.ReadLine();\n\nint enteredPin;\n\nif (int.TryParse(pinInput, out enteredPin))\n\n{\n\nif (enteredPin == correctPin)\n\n{\n\nisPinCorrect = true;\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nattempts++;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Incorrect pin. Attempts left: \" + (maxAttempts - attempts));\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a numeric pin.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif (!isPinCorrect)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Maximum attempts reached. Exiting.\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nNow, if the pin is correct, proceed to the menu.\n\nI'll write another loop for the menu.\n\nbool continueTransaction = true;\n\nwhile (continueTransaction)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"\\nATM Menu:\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"1. Balance Enquiry\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"2. Cash Withdrawal\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"3. Deposit Money\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"4. Change Pin\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"5. Exit\");\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter your choice: \");\n\nstring choiceInput = Console.ReadLine();\n\nif (int.TryParse(choiceInput, out int choice))\n\n{\n\nswitch (choice)\n\n{\n\ncase 1:\n\n// Balance Enquiry\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Your balance is: \" + balance);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 2:\n\n// Cash Withdrawal\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: \");\n\nif (double.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out double withdrawAmount))\n\n{\n\nif (withdrawAmount > balance)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Insufficient balance.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nbalance -= withdrawAmount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: \" + balance);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid amount.\");\n\n}\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 3:\n\n// Deposit Money\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter the amount to deposit: \");\n\nif (double.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out double depositAmount))\n\n{\n\nbalance += depositAmount;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Deposit successful. New balance: \" + balance);\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid amount.\");\n\n}\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 4:\n\n// Change Pin\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter new pin: \");\n\nstring newPinInput = Console.ReadLine();\n\nif (int.TryParse(newPinInput, out int newPin))\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Confirm new pin: \");\n\nstring confirmPinInput = Console.ReadLine();\n\nif (int.TryParse(confirmPinInput, out int confirmPin))\n\n{\n\nif (newPin == confirmPin)\n\n{\n\ncorrectPin = newPin;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Pin changed successfully.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Pins do not match.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid confirmation pin.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid new pin.\");\n\n}\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 5:\n\n// Exit\n\ncontinueTransaction = false;\n\nbreak;\n\ndefault:\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.\");\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\");\n\n}\n\nConsole.Write(\"Do you want to perform another transaction? (yes/no): \");\n\nstring continueInput = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();\n\nif (continueInput != \"yes\" && continueInput != \"y\")\n\n{\n\ncontinueTransaction = false;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThat should be the basic structure.\n\nI need to test this to make sure it works as expected.\n\nLet me think about possible test cases.\n\n1. Correct pin on first attempt.\n\n2. Incorrect pin multiple times, reaching max attempts.\n\n3. Balance enquiry: check if it displays the correct balance.\n\n4. Cash withdrawal: valid amount, insufficient balance.\n\n5. Deposit money: valid amount.\n\n6. Change pin: new pin matches confirmation, doesn't match, invalid input.\n\n7. Invalid choices in the menu.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like entering negative amounts for withdrawal or deposit.\n\nMaybe I should add checks to prevent negative amounts.\n\nSimilarly, for the pin, ensure it's a 4-digit number.\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple.\n\nI might add some constraints later.\n\nAlright, time to write the code and test it.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple ATM simulation using C#, we will develop a console application that allows users to perform various transactions such as checking balance, withdrawing cash, depositing money, and changing their PIN. The application will validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **PIN Validation:** \n   - Hardcode a correct PIN and balance.\n   - Provide up to 3 attempts for the user to enter the correct PIN.\n   - Exit the program if all attempts fail.\n\n2. **Menu Options:**\n   - **Balance Enquiry:** Display the current balance.\n   - **Cash Withdrawal:** Deduct the specified amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n   - **Deposit Money:** Add the specified amount to the balance.\n   - **Change PIN:** Allow the user to change their PIN after confirming the new PIN.\n   - **Exit:** End the program.\n\n3. **Input Handling:**\n   - Use `Console.ReadLine()` to read inputs.\n   - Validate numeric inputs using `int.TryParse()` and `double.TryParse()` to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.\n\n4. **Looping Transactions:**\n   - After each transaction, ask the user if they want to perform another transaction.\n   - Continue the loop until the user chooses to exit.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int correctPin = 1234;\n        double balance = 1000.0;\n        int maxAttempts = 3;\n        int attempts = 0;\n        bool isPinCorrect = false;\n\n        // PIN validation loop\n        while (attempts < maxAttempts && !isPinCorrect)\n        {\n            Console.Write(\"Enter your PIN: \");\n            string pinInput = Console.ReadLine();\n            if (int.TryParse(pinInput, out int enteredPin))\n            {\n                if (enteredPin == correctPin)\n                {\n                    isPinCorrect = true;\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    attempts++;\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Incorrect PIN.

Please select a valid option.\");\n                        break;\n                }\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\");\n            }\n            Console.Write(\"Do you want to perform another transaction? (yes/no): \");\n            string continueInput = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();\n            if (continueInput != \"yes\" && continueInput != \"y\")\n            {\n                continueTransaction = false;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **PIN Validation:**\n   - The user is prompted to enter their PIN. If the PIN is correct, they proceed to the menu. Incorrect PINs result in error messages, and the program exits after 3 attempts.\n\n2. **Menu Options:**\n   - **Balance Enquiry:** Simply reads and displays the current balance.\n   - **Cash Withdrawal:** Asks for the amount to withdraw. If sufficient balance is available, deducts the amount; otherwise, shows an error.\n   - **Deposit Money:** Asks for the amount to deposit and adds it to the balance.\n   - **Change PIN:** Allows changing the PIN after confirming the new PIN.\n   - **Exit:** Exits the program.\n\n3. **Input Handling:**\n   - Uses `TryParse` methods to handle non-numeric inputs without crashing the program.\n\n4. **Looping Transactions:**\n   - After each transaction, the user is asked if they want to perform another transaction. The loop continues until the user decides to exit."
