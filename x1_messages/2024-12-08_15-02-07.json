        "content": "So I've got this geometry problem here. There's a square with sides that are 10 inches long, and there's a circle inscribed inside it, which means the circle touches all four sides of the square exactly once. I need to find the area of this circle.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. I have a square, and inside it, a circle that touches each side exactly once. So, the circle is as big as it can be without crossing the sides of the square.\n\nSince the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle must be equal to the side length of the square. That makes sense because the circle touches all four sides, so from one side to the opposite side, passing through the center, should be equal to the side of the square.\n\nSo, the diameter of the circle is 10 inches, which means the radius is half of that. Radius is 5 inches.\n\nNow, the area of a circle is given by the formula A equals pi times the radius squared. So, A = \u03c0 * r\u00b2.\n\nPlugging in the radius, A = \u03c0 * (5)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 25.\n\nSo, the area is 25\u03c0 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using the properties of inscribed shapes or something like that.\n\nWell, in a square, the diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side of the square, which is what I already used.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the diagonal of the square and see if that relates to the circle, but that seems unnecessary because the circle is touching the sides, not the corners.\n\nLet me see, is there a formula for the area of an inscribed circle in a square?\n\nActually, I recall that for a circle inscribed in a square, the area of the circle is \u03c0 times the side squared divided by 4.\n\nWait, let's see: A = \u03c0 * (s/2)^2, where s is the side of the square.\n\nThat's the same as A = \u03c0 * (5)^2 = 25\u03c0, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the circumference of the circle and see if that helps, but I don't think it's necessary in this case since I'm only asked for the area.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the circle is tangent to all four sides of the square, meaning that the distance from the center of the circle to any side is equal to the radius.\n\nSince the center of the circle is at the intersection of the diagonals of the square, and the distance from the center to any side is half the side length, which is 5 inches, again confirming the radius is 5 inches.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the area should be 25\u03c0 square inches.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\pi} \\]"
