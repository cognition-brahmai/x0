        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we've got a company with 10 employees. Each employee works 8 hours per day, and they're paid $20 per hour. The company operates for 22 working days in a month. We need to find out how much the company spends on employee salaries in that month.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how much one employee earns in a day. Since they work 8 hours a day and earn $20 per hour, their daily earnings would be:\n\n8 hours/day * $20/hour = $160/day\n\nOkay, so each employee makes $160 per day.\n\nNext, I'll calculate how much one employee earns in a month. Since the company operates for 22 working days in a month, the monthly salary for one employee would be:\n\n$160/day * 22 days/month = $3520/month\n\nAlright, so one employee gets $3520 per month.\n\nNow, there are 10 employees, so to find the total salary expenditure for all employees in a month, I'll multiply the monthly salary of one employee by the number of employees:\n\n$3520/month/employee * 10 employees = $35,200/month\n\nSo, the company spends $35,200 on employee salaries each month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:\n\n- 10 employees\n\n- Each works 8 hours/day\n\n- Paid $20/hour\n\n- Company operates 22 days/month\n\nFirst, hourly wage is $20, working 8 hours a day, so daily wage is 8 * 20 = $160.\n\nThen, monthly wage for one employee is 160 * 22 = $3520.\n\nTotal for 10 employees is 3520 * 10 = $35,200.\n\nSeems correct. Alternatively, I could think of it in total hours worked.\n\nTotal hours worked by one employee in a month: 8 hours/day * 22 days = 176 hours/month.\n\nSo, salary for one employee: 176 hours * $20/hour = $3520/month.\n\nTotal for 10 employees: 3520 * 10 = $35,200/month.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total hours worked by all employees in a month and then multiply by the hourly rate.\n\nTotal employees: 10\n\nEach works 8 hours/day for 22 days: 8 * 22 = 176 hours/employee/month\n\nTotal hours for all employees: 10 * 176 = 1760 hours/month\n\nTotal salary expenditure: 1760 hours * $20/hour = $35,200/month\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think $35,200 is the correct monthly salary expenditure for the company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35200} \\]"
