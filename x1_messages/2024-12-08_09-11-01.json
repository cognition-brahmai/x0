        "content": "Let's see. So, in this game, there are three players: Alice, Bob, and Carol. They each score some points, and there's a relationship between their scores.\n\nFirst, it says that Carol scores 4 points. So, Carol's score is 4.\n\nNext, Bob scores three times as many points as Carol. So, since Carol scores 4 points, Bob's score would be 3 times that, which is 3 * 4 = 12 points.\n\nThen, Alice scores twice as many points as Bob. So, since Bob has 12 points, Alice's score would be 2 times that, which is 2 * 12 = 24 points.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If Carol has 4 points, and Bob has three times that, yes, 3 * 4 is 12. Then, Alice has twice Bob's score, so 2 * 12 is indeed 24.\n\nSo, Alice scores 24 points.\n\nBut let me think about it another way to make sure. If Carol has 4 points, and Bob has three times as many as Carol, that's correct. And Alice has twice as many as Bob, which also seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can express their scores in terms of Carol's score. Let\u2019s denote Carol's score as C, Bob's score as B, and Alice's score as A.\n\nGiven:\n\nA = 2B\n\nB = 3C\n\nAnd C = 4\n\nSo, plugging in the value of C into B's equation:\n\nB = 3 * 4 = 12\n\nThen, plugging B into A's equation:\n\nA = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nSame result. So, Alice scores 24 points.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's another way to approach this. Let's try to express everything in terms of Alice's score.\n\nWe have:\n\nA = 2B\n\nAnd B = 3C\n\nGiven C = 4\n\nSo, B = 3 * 4 = 12\n\nThen, A = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nAlternatively, I could write A in terms of C directly.\n\nSince B = 3C, and A = 2B, then A = 2 * (3C) = 6C\n\nGiven C = 4, then A = 6 * 4 = 24\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, no matter how I approach it, Alice scores 24 points.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Sometimes I overthink these things, but in this case, it seems clear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
