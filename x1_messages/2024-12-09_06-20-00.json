        "content": "Based on the information provided, the primary focus of sociology is the exploration of social behavior and human groups. This includes looking at how people interact with each other, the roles they play in society, and the structures that shape these interactions. So, the correct answer would be option B: The exploration of social behavior and human groups.\n\nTo elaborate a bit more, sociology is a broad discipline that encompasses various aspects of human society. It looks at everything from small-scale interactions between individuals to large-scale social structures and institutions. Social theory is a part of sociology that tries to make sense of these social phenomena through theoretical frameworks, while the sociology of gender focuses specifically on how gender influences social interactions and structures.\n\nOption A, the study of individual psychological processes, is more aligned with psychology rather than sociology. While sociology does consider individual agency, it places more emphasis on how social contexts influence individual behavior and vice versa.\n\nOption C, the analysis of economic systems and financial markets, is typically the domain of economics. Although sociology may intersect with economics, especially in areas like economic sociology, the core focus of sociology is on social relationships and structures rather than economic systems per se.\n\nOption D, the examination of biological differences between genders, is more related to biology or perhaps gender studies that incorporate biological perspectives. Sociology of gender, as mentioned, focuses on the social constructs and influences related to gender, not the biological differences.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, B is the most accurate description of sociology's primary focus.\n"
