        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a rectangular room is 12 feet long and 8 feet wide, and I need to find out what the area of the floor is, but in square yards. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst things first, I know that area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, in this case, it's 12 feet times 8 feet. That should give me the area in square feet. Let me do that quick: 12 times 8 is 96. So, the area is 96 square feet.\n\nBut the question wants the area in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards. Hmm, I recall that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet. So, for lengths, it's 3 feet per yard. But since we're dealing with area, it's square yards, which means I have to square the conversion factor.\n\nSo, 1 yard squared is equal to 3 feet times 3 feet, which is 9 square feet. Therefore, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet.\n\nNow, I have 96 square feet, and I want to convert that to square yards. So, I should divide the area in square feet by the number of square feet in one square yard. That makes sense.\n\nSo, 96 square feet divided by 9 square feet per square yard. Let me do that calculation: 96 divided by 9 is 10.666..., which is 10 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to express that? Maybe I can leave it as a decimal, 10.666..., or convert the fractional part. Let's see, 2/3 as a decimal is approximately 0.666, so 10.666 is fine.\n\nBut maybe I can double-check my conversion. Let's see, another way to think about it is to first convert the dimensions from feet to yards and then multiply them to get the area in square yards.\n\nSo, 12 feet long: since 1 yard is 3 feet, 12 feet divided by 3 is 4 yards.\n\nSimilarly, 8 feet wide: 8 divided by 3 is approximately 2.666 yards.\n\nNow, multiply those together: 4 yards times 2.666 yards is 10.666 square yards, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nOkay, good, that makes sense. So, the area of the floor is 10.666... square yards. But maybe I can express it as a fraction. 10 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nAlternatively, if more precision is needed, I could express it as a decimal, like 10.6667 square yards, rounding to four decimal places.\n\nBut for most practical purposes, 10.67 square yards would be sufficient.\n\nWait, but in the context of this problem, since the measurements are given in whole feet, maybe two decimal places are okay.\n\nAlternatively, leaving it as a fraction might be more precise and acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is 10 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nLet me just confirm the conversion factor one more time to be sure. Yes, since 1 yard = 3 feet, then 1 square yard = 3 feet * 3 feet = 9 square feet.\n\nSo, to convert from square feet to square yards, divide by 9.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I remember correctly, sometimes area conversions can be a bit tricky, so it's good to double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it: there are 9 square feet in 1 square yard, so to find out how many square yards are in 96 square feet, I divide 96 by 9, which is indeed 10.666...\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply by the conversion factor. Since 1 square foot is equal to 1/9 square yards, then 96 square feet times 1/9 square yards per square foot would give me the same result.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the area of the floor is 10.666... square yards, or 10 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nI think for the purposes of this problem, expressing it as a fraction is acceptable, but if decimal is preferred, 10.67 would be fine as well.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nMaybe using proportions. If 9 square feet is equal to 1 square yard, then 96 square feet is equal to x square yards.\n\nSo, setting up the proportion: 9/1 = 96/x\n\nThen, solving for x: x = 96 / 9 = 10.666...\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, using unit analysis:\n\n96 square feet * (1 square yard / 9 square feet) = 96/9 square yards = 10.666... square yards.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 10 and 2/3 square yards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10\\frac{2}{3}} \\]"
