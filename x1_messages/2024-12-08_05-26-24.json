The Parthenon is a famous temple in Athens, Greece, built in the 5th century BCE. It's considered a masterpiece of ancient Greek architecture. Now, regarding the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618, it's a mathematical ratio that has been used in art and architecture for centuries because it's believed to be aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThere is a lot of debate among scholars about whether the ancient Greeks intentionally designed the Parthenon to match the golden ratio. Some researchers have found that certain dimensions of the Parthenon do approximate the golden ratio, such as the ratio of the width to the height of the front facade. However, others argue that these observations are coincidental and that there is no concrete evidence that the ancient Greeks had a concept of the golden ratio or used it in their designs.\n\nThe ancient Greeks were certainly knowledgeable about mathematics and proportion, as seen in the works of mathematicians like Pythagoras and Euclid. Euclid, in his Elements, does describe the golden ratio, calling it the \"extreme and mean ratio.\" But whether this knowledge was applied to the design of the Parthenon is still a topic of discussion.\n\nMoving on to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, which is a drawing made by Leonardo around 1490. It's based on the work of the Roman architect Vitruvius, who wrote about the proportions of the human body. The drawing depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart, inscribed in a circle and a square.\n\nNow, about the golden ratio in the Vitruvian Man. There is a common misconception that the Vitruvian Man is based on the golden ratio. However, if you look at Leonardo's own notes accompanying the drawing, there is no mention of the golden ratio. Instead, the proportions are based on Vitruvius's descriptions of the human body's proportions.\n\nLeonardo was certainly fascinated by mathematics and proportion, and he did study the golden ratio in his later works, such as in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli's book \"Divina Proportione\" in the early 16th century. But in the Vitruvian Man, the proportions follow Vitruvius's descriptions, which are based on different ratios.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. The Parthenon: There is some evidence that certain dimensions approximate the golden ratio, but it's unclear whether this was intentional on the part of the ancient Greek architects.\n\n2. Vitruvian Man: The proportions are based on Vitruvius's descriptions, not on the golden ratio, and there is no reference to the golden ratio in Leonardo's notes for this particular work.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things for you! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
