        "content": "So the factory is currently making 500 units every day, right? And now, because more people want their product, they want to make 20% more. I need to figure out how many units that will be after the increase.\n\nFirst, I should understand what 20% of 500 units is. Percentages can sometimes confuse me, but I think I've got it. 20% means 20 per 100, so in terms of 500 units, it would be 20/100 times 500.\n\nLet me calculate that: 20 divided by 100 is 0.2, and 0.2 multiplied by 500 is 100 units. So, 20% of 500 is 100 units.\n\nNow, to find the total production after the increase, I need to add that 100 units to the original 500 units.\n\n500 units + 100 units = 600 units.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this? Maybe I can calculate it by finding what 120% of 500 is, since they're increasing by 20%.\n\n120% means 120 per 100, so 120/100 times 500.\n\n120 divided by 100 is 1.2, and 1.2 multiplied by 500 is 600 units.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, after a 20% increase, the factory will produce 600 units per day.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's think about it differently. If 20% of 500 is 100, and I add that to 500 to get 600, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to decrease production by 20%, I would subtract 100 from 500 to get 400 units.\n\nWait, but that's a decrease, and we're dealing with an increase here. So, adding 20% should indeed bring it to 600 units.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Is there something about daily production that might affect this calculation? For example, are there weekends or holidays to consider? But the question just says \"per day,\" so I think it's safe to assume it's a daily production rate without considering specific days off.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the unit of measurement is consistent. The original production is in units per day, and the increase is a percentage of that daily production. So, the answer should also be in units per day.\n\nHmm, I think I've covered all the bases here. The factory will produce 600 units per day after a 20% increase in production.\n\nJust to double-check, let's try another method. If 20% of 500 is 100, then increasing by 20% should be the same as multiplying 500 by 1 plus 20%, which is 1 + 0.2 = 1.2.\n\nSo, 500 times 1.2 equals 600 units. Again, the same answer.\n\nI feel confident now that 600 units is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
