        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 players in a chess tournament, and each player plays against every other player exactly once. I need to find out how many games are played in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a problem about counting the number of games in a round-robin tournament where each participant plays every other participant once. So, in this case, with 10 players, I need to figure out how many unique pairs of players there are, since each pair plays one game.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order of selection is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this scenario, n is the number of players, which is 10, and k is 2, since games are played between two players.\n\nSo, the total number of games should be C(10, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\cdot 8!}\n\\]\n\nI know that 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!, so the 8! terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2! \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 45 unique games to be played.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each player plays against every other player. So, player 1 plays against players 2 through 10, which is 9 games. Player 2 then plays against players 3 through 10, which is 8 games (since the game between player 1 and player 2 has already been counted). Player 3 plays against players 4 through 10, which is 7 games, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of games would be:\n\n9 (for player 1) + 8 (for player 2) + 7 (for player 3) + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 (for the last player, who has already played against all others).\n\nSo, that's 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0.\n\nLet me add those up:\n\n9 + 8 = 17\n\n17 + 7 = 24\n\n24 + 6 = 30\n\n30 + 5 = 35\n\n35 + 4 = 39\n\n39 + 3 = 42\n\n42 + 2 = 44\n\n44 + 1 = 45\n\n45 + 0 = 45\n\nSo, again, I get 45 games.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, since player 1 plays 9 games, player 2 plays 8, and so on, down to player 9 playing 1 game, and player 10 playing 0 games, the total number of games is the sum of the first 9 natural numbers:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{9 \\times 10}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nAgain, 45 games.\n\nSo, all three methods give me the same answer: 45 games.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of double-counting or missing games. In the combination approach, each game is uniquely identified by the pair of players, so there's no double-counting. In the sequential addition approach, each player's games are accounted for without repeating games already counted from previous players.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the total number of games played in the tournament is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
