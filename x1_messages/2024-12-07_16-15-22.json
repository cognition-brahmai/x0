The time it takes to reach the Pyramids of Giza by plane depends on your starting location. For example, if you're flying from New York, it would take approximately 10-12 hours, including flight time and possible layovers. From London, it's around 5-7 hours, depending on the airline and any stops. Once you arrive at Cairo International Airport, you can take a taxi or arrange for a tour to reach the pyramids, which are located in Giza, about 20 kilometers from the airport. The journey by road usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on traffic conditions."
