        "content": "Certainly! To create a PowerShell script that monitors a specific directory for changes and logs those events with details such as the type of change and timestamp, you can use the `FileSystemWatcher` class. This class provides a way to watch for changes in a directory and get notifications when changes occur.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step guide and the corresponding PowerShell script to achieve this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Create a FileSystemWatcher Object:**\n   - This object will watch the specified directory for changes.\n\n2. **Set Properties:**\n   - Set the path of the directory to monitor.\n   - Specify which types of changes to watch for (e.g., created, deleted, changed, renamed).\n\n3. **Define Event Handlers:**\n   - Create event handlers for each type of change you're interested in.\n   - In these handlers, log the details of the event, including the type of change and the timestamp.\n\n4. **Start Watching:**\n   - Begin monitoring the directory by starting the watcher.\n\n5. **Log Events:**\n   - Write the event details to a log file or display them in the console.\n\n### PowerShell Script\n\n```powershell\n# Define the directory to monitor\n$directoryToMonitor = \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\directory\"\n\n# Define the log file path\n$logFilePath = \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\log.txt\"\n\n# Create a new FileSystemWatcher object\n$watcher = New-Object System.IO.FileSystemWatcher\n$watcher.Path = $directoryToMonitor\n$watcher.IncludeSubdirectories = $true  # Set to $true if you want to monitor subdirectories\n\n# Specify the types of changes to watch for\n$watcher.NotifyFilter = [System.IO.NotifyFilters]'FileName, LastWrite, DirectoryName'\n\n# Define the event handlers\n$action = {\n    $eventArgs = $Event.SourceEventArgs\n    $changeType = $eventArgs.ChangeType\n    $timeStamp = (Get-Date).ToString()\n    $name = $eventArgs.Name\n\n    # Log the event\n    \"$timeStamp - $changeType: $name\" | Out-File -FilePath $logFilePath -Append\n}\n\n# Register the event handlers\n$watcher.Created += $action\n$watcher.Deleted += $action\n$watcher.Changed += $action\n$watcher.Renamed += $action\n\n# Start watching\n$watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = $true\n\n# Keep the script running\nwhile ($true) {\n    Start-Sleep -Seconds 10\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **FileSystemWatcher Setup:**\n   - The `FileSystemWatcher` is created and configured to monitor the specified directory.\n   - `IncludeSubdirectories` is set to `$true` if you want to monitor subdirectories as well.\n\n2. **Event Handling:**\n   - Event handlers are defined for `Created`, `Deleted`, `Changed`, and `Renamed` events.\n   - Each event captures the type of change, the timestamp, and the name of the affected file or directory.\n   - The event details are appended to a log file specified by `$logFilePath`.\n\n3. **Keeping the Script Running:**\n   - A `while ($true)` loop with `Start-Sleep` keeps the script running indefinitely, allowing continuous monitoring.\n\n### Notes\n\n- **Permissions:** Ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to access the directory and write to the log file.\n- **Performance:** Monitoring large directories or directories with high activity may impact performance.\n- **Log Management:** Consider implementing log rotation or size limits to manage the log file's growth.\n\nThis script provides a basic framework for monitoring directory changes and logging events. You can expand upon it by adding more sophisticated logging, error handling, or additional event types as needed."
