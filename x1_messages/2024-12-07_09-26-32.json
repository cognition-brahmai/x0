        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of products: A and B. Every day, it churns out 1,000 units of A and 1,500 units of B. Now, each unit of A needs 2 hours of labor to make, and each unit of B requires 3 hours. The factory runs 24 hours a day, and we need to figure out how many workers are needed to meet this production schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total labor hours required for producing both products every day.\n\nFor product A:\n\n1,000 units * 2 hours/unit = 2,000 hours\n\nFor product B:\n\n1,500 units * 3 hours/unit = 4,500 hours\n\nSo, the total labor hours needed per day are:\n\n2,000 hours (for A) + 4,500 hours (for B) = 6,500 hours\n\nNow, the factory operates 24 hours a day. If each worker works the entire shift, then each worker can contribute 24 hours per day.\n\nTo find out how many workers are needed, I can divide the total labor hours required by the number of hours one worker can work in a day.\n\nNumber of workers = Total labor hours / Hours per worker per day\n\nNumber of workers = 6,500 hours / 24 hours/workers/day \u2248 270.833 workers\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a worker, you'd need to round up to the next whole number. So, the factory would need 271 workers to meet the production schedule.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps workers aren't working the full 24 hours straight; maybe they work in shifts. If that's the case, the calculation might be different.\n\nAssuming the factory operates 24/7 and workers work in shifts, say 8-hour shifts, then each worker would be contributing 8 hours of work per day.\n\nLet's recalculate with that in mind.\n\nNumber of workers = Total labor hours / Hours per worker per day\n\nNumber of workers = 6,500 hours / 8 hours/workers/day = 812.5 workers\n\nAgain, rounding up, that would require 813 workers.\n\nBut this number is significantly higher than the previous calculation. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider how many shifts are being run per day. If the factory operates 24 hours a day and workers work 8-hour shifts, then there are 24 / 8 = 3 shifts per day.\n\nIn this case, the total labor hours provided by one worker per day would still be 8 hours, but with three shifts, the same worker could cover all 24 hours.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. If workers work in shifts, then each worker is only working their assigned shift, not the entire 24 hours. So, for continuous 24-hour operation with 8-hour shifts, you would need three times the number of workers needed for an 8-hour operation.\n\nLet me try to clarify this.\n\nOption 1: Workers work 24-hour shifts.\n\nIn this case, each worker works 24 hours a day, contributing 24 hours of labor per day.\n\nTotal workers needed = 6,500 hours / 24 hours/workers/day \u2248 270.833 \u2192 271 workers\n\nOption 2: Workers work 8-hour shifts, and there are three shifts per day to cover 24 hours.\n\nIn this case, each worker works 8 hours per day.\n\nTotal workers needed per shift = (Total labor hours) / (Hours per worker per shift) / (Number of shifts)\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let's think differently.\n\nTotal labor hours needed per day: 6,500 hours\n\nEach worker contributes 8 hours per shift.\n\nNumber of shifts per day: 3\n\nTotal workers needed per shift = Total labor hours / (Hours per worker per shift * Number of shifts)\n\nTotal workers needed per shift = 6,500 / (8 * 3) = 6,500 / 24 \u2248 270.833 \u2192 271 workers per shift\n\nBut since there are three shifts, the total number of workers needed would be 271 workers per shift * 3 shifts = 813 workers\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent because in the first option, where workers work 24-hour shifts, fewer workers are needed. But in reality, having workers work 24-hour shifts isn't practical, so the second option seems more realistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some workers are working overlapping shifts to meet the production demands.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet's go back to the initial approach.\n\nTotal labor hours needed per day: 6,500 hours\n\nEach worker can work 24 hours per day.\n\nNumber of workers needed = 6,500 / 24 \u2248 270.833 \u2192 271 workers\n\nBut this assumes that each worker is available to work 24 hours a day, which is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, if workers work 8-hour shifts, then:\n\nNumber of workers needed = 6,500 / 8 = 812.5 \u2192 813 workers\n\nBut this doesn't take into account the multiple shifts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of total labor hours available per day.\n\nIf each worker works 8 hours per day, and there are three shifts, then the total labor hours available per day per worker is 8 hours.\n\nBut since there are three shifts, each worker can contribute 8 hours per shift, and with three shifts, the factory can have 3 workers per position, but I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose we have W workers, each working 8-hour shifts.\n\nSince there are three shifts in a day, the same worker can't work overlapping shifts.\n\nWait, no, each worker can only work one shift per day.\n\nTherefore, the total labor hours provided by W workers per day is W * 8 hours.\n\nWe need this to be at least 6,500 hours.\n\nSo, W * 8 \u2265 6,500\n\nTherefore, W \u2265 6,500 / 8 = 812.5\n\nRounding up, W = 813 workers\n\nThis seems more accurate, considering realistic shift arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, if workers can work multiple shifts per day, but that would be excessive and unrealistic.\n\nSo, assuming each worker works one 8-hour shift per day, the factory would need 813 workers to meet the daily production requirements.\n\nBut let's consider if the factory operates with workers doing multiple tasks or if there's any overlap in labor requirements.\n\nWait, perhaps some tasks can be done simultaneously, reducing the need for as many workers.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems that the production process requires a certain amount of labor hours, and the factory needs to arrange its workforce accordingly.\n\nGiven that, and assuming 8-hour workdays per worker, the factory needs 813 workers.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way to schedule the workers.\n\nLet me consider the total daily labor hours required again: 6,500 hours.\n\nIf the factory operates 24 hours a day, then the average number of workers needed at any given time is 6,500 hours / 24 hours = approximately 270.833 workers.\n\nThis means that, on average, about 271 workers are needed per hour.\n\nIf workers work 8-hour shifts, then each worker is covering 8 hours, so the number of workers needed is 271 workers per hour * 8 hours = 2,168 workers.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if we have 271 workers spread out over 24 hours, each worker would be covering 24 / 271 \u2248 0.0885 hours, which is about 5.3 minutes per worker, which is impractical.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nIf the factory needs 6,500 labor hours per day and operates 24 hours a day, then the number of workers needed is proportional to the labor hours required per hour.\n\nFirst, find out how many labor hours are needed per hour.\n\nTotal labor hours per day: 6,500 hours\n\nTotal hours per day: 24 hours\n\nLabor hours needed per hour: 6,500 / 24 \u2248 270.833 hours per hour\n\nThis means that, at any given hour, the factory needs approximately 271 workers to be working.\n\nIf workers work 8-hour shifts, then each worker contributes 8 hours of labor per day.\n\nTo cover the 271 workers needed per hour around the clock, we need to have enough workers to cover all hours.\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, and each worker covers 8 hours, the number of workers needed is:\n\nNumber of workers = (Labor hours needed per hour) * (Total hours in day) / (Hours per worker)\n\nNumber of workers = 271 * 24 / 8 = 271 * 3 = 813 workers\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 813 workers to meet the production schedule, assuming 8-hour shifts per worker per day.\n\nBut let's consider if workers might work different shift lengths or if there's any overlap in shifts.\n\nIf workers work 12-hour shifts, for example, then the calculation would be different.\n\nLet's explore that.\n\nAssume workers work 12-hour shifts.\n\nTotal labor hours per worker per day: 12 hours\n\nTotal labor hours needed per day: 6,500 hours\n\nNumber of workers needed = 6,500 / 12 \u2248 541.666 \u2192 542 workers\n\nThis is fewer workers than the 813 needed for 8-hour shifts.\n\nHowever, with 12-hour shifts, the number of shifts per day would be 24 / 12 = 2 shifts.\n\nSo, with 542 workers, each working 12-hour shifts, the factory can meet the 6,500-hour requirement.\n\nThis seems more efficient in terms of the number of workers needed.\n\nBut practically, 12-hour shifts might be demanding for the workers, and there may be labor laws restricting the number of hours worked in a row.\n\nMoreover, worker productivity might decline with longer shifts.\n\nBut based on the problem, we don't have information about shift lengths or labor laws, so perhaps we should stick with the initial assumption of 8-hour shifts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory uses a combination of shift lengths.\n\nBut to keep it simple, assuming 8-hour shifts, the factory needs 813 workers.\n\nAlternatively, if workers are working continuously without breaks, then the initial calculation of 271 workers might suffice.\n\nBut in reality, workers need breaks and cannot work 24 hours straight.\n\nTherefore, the more realistic scenario is needing 813 workers working in shifts.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet's consider the total labor hours needed per day: 6,500 hours.\n\nThe factory operates 24 hours a day.\n\nTherefore, the average number of workers needed is 6,500 / 24 \u2248 270.833 workers.\n\nNow, if workers work 8-hour shifts, then each worker contributes 8 hours per day.\n\nTo cover the average need of 271 workers, the total number of workers required would be:\n\nNumber of workers = (Average workers needed per hour) * (Hours per day) / (Hours per worker per day)\n\nNumber of workers = 271 * 24 / 8 = 271 * 3 = 813 workers\n\nAgain, this matches the previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some tasks can be done in parallel, reducing the number of workers needed at any given time.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that 813 workers are needed to meet the daily production requirements with 8-hour shifts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the factory needs 813 workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{813}
