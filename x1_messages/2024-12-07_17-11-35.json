        "content": "So I've got this problem here about fencing a garden with an additional buffer. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the garden is rectangular, and its dimensions are 15 meters long and 8 meters wide. So, that's straightforward. Now, I need to build a fence around it with an additional 1-meter buffer on all sides. That means the fence won't be right against the garden; instead, it will be 1 meter outside the garden on every side.\n\nOkay, so to find out how much fencing I need, I need to calculate the perimeter of the area that includes the garden and the buffer zone.\n\nLet me visualize this. If the garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I'm adding 1 meter to all sides, that means the buffer is added to both length and width, on both sides.\n\nSo, for the length:\n\nThe original length is 15 meters. Adding 1 meter to one end and 1 meter to the other end means the total length of the area to be fenced is 15 + 1 + 1 = 17 meters.\n\nSimilarly, for the width:\n\nThe original width is 8 meters. Adding 1 meter to one side and 1 meter to the other side means the total width of the area to be fenced is 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. If I add 1 meter to each side, doesn't that mean I'm adding 2 meters to the total length and 2 meters to the total width?\n\nYes, because 1 meter on each side.\n\nSo, the total length becomes 15 + 2 = 17 meters, and the total width becomes 8 + 2 = 10 meters.\n\nAlright, now, to find the perimeter, which is the total length of fencing needed, I use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54 meters.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it this way: the buffer adds 1 meter outside on all sides, so effectively, the fencing is surrounding a larger rectangle that is 15 + 2(1) = 17 meters in length and 8 + 2(1) = 10 meters in width.\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nSo, the perimeter is indeed 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54 meters.\n\nTherefore, I need 54 meters of fencing.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I first calculate the perimeter of the garden itself, which is 2 \u00d7 (15 + 8) = 2 \u00d7 23 = 46 meters.\n\nNow, since I'm adding a 1-meter buffer around all sides, I need to add extra fencing to account for this buffer.\n\nBut it's not just adding 4 meters (1 meter for each side), because the buffer affects both length and width.\n\nActually, no, my first approach seems more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, think of the buffer as expanding the garden by 1 meter in all directions.\n\nSo, the new dimensions are indeed 15 + 2 = 17 meters in length and 8 + 2 = 10 meters in width.\n\nPerimeter is then 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 54 meters.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each side, the fencing is 1 meter outside the garden.\n\nSo, for the two lengths, each is now 15 + 2(1) = 17 meters.\n\nFor the two widths, each is now 8 + 2(1) = 10 meters.\n\nSo, total fencing is 2 \u00d7 17 + 2 \u00d7 10 = 34 + 20 = 54 meters.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, think of the buffer as adding a path around the garden that is 1 meter wide.\n\nTo find the perimeter of this path, it would still be the same as the perimeter of the outer rectangle, which is 54 meters.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the buffer adds 1 meter to each side, so the total addition to the perimeter is 1 meter on each of the four sides, which would be 4 meters.\n\nBut if I add 4 meters to the original perimeter of 46 meters, I get 50 meters, which doesn't match my earlier calculation of 54 meters.\n\nHmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I have a rectangle that is 15 meters by 8 meters, and I add 1 meter to all sides, the new dimensions are 17 meters by 10 meters, as I said before.\n\nThe perimeter of the new rectangle is 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 54 meters.\n\nBut if I think about the buffer adding 1 meter to each side, it's not just adding 1 meter to the length and width once; it's adding 1 meter on both sides of each dimension.\n\nSo, for the length: 15 + 1 (one side) + 1 (other side) = 17 meters.\n\nSimilarly for the width: 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 meters.\n\nSo, the perimeter is 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 54 meters.\n\nAlternatively, considering the buffer as a path around the garden, the path itself has a width of 1 meter.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the outer edge of the path, it's still 17 meters in length and 10 meters in width, giving a perimeter of 54 meters.\n\nSo, why did I get 50 meters when I added 4 meters to the original perimeter?\n\nBecause that's not how it works.\n\nAdding 1 meter to each side doesn't just add 1 meter to the perimeter; it adds 2 meters to the perimeter for each pair of opposite sides.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, for each side, the fencing is 1 meter outside, so for each pair of opposite sides, the length increases by 2 meters (1 meter on each side).\n\nBut since there are two pairs of opposite sides, the total increase in perimeter is 4 meters.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nOriginal perimeter: 2 \u00d7 (15 + 8) = 46 meters.\n\nNew perimeter: 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 54 meters.\n\nDifference: 54 - 46 = 8 meters.\n\nBut according to my earlier thought, adding 1 meter to all sides should add 4 meters to the perimeter, but actually, it's adding 8 meters.\n\nWait, I must be miscalculating something.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf I add 1 meter to each side, then for each side, the length increases by 1 meter.\n\nBut in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so adding 1 meter to each side means:\n\n- Each length side increases by 1 meter.\n\n- Each width side increases by 1 meter.\n\nSo, for two length sides: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2 meters added.\n\nFor two width sides: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2 meters added.\n\nTotal addition to the perimeter: 2 + 2 = 4 meters.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, the perimeter increases by 8 meters (from 46 to 54).\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the perimeter increases.\n\nLet me consider a smaller example.\n\nSuppose I have a rectangle that is 2 meters by 3 meters.\n\nPerimeter: 2 \u00d7 (2 + 3) = 10 meters.\n\nNow, add 1 meter to all sides.\n\nNew dimensions: 2 + 2 = 4 meters in length, 3 + 2 = 5 meters in width.\n\nNew perimeter: 2 \u00d7 (4 + 5) = 18 meters.\n\nDifference: 18 - 10 = 8 meters.\n\nBut according to the earlier thought, adding 1 meter to all sides should add 4 meters to the perimeter, but here it adds 8 meters.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about it differently.\n\nActually, when you add 1 meter to all sides, you are adding 1 meter to each side of the rectangle.\n\nIn a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, but when you add 1 meter to each side, both length and width increase by 2 meters each (since each dimension has two sides).\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, for each side, you're adding 1 meter outward.\n\nSo, for each length side, it becomes 15 + 1 = 16 meters.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, no, if you add 1 meter outward to each side, then the length side becomes 15 + 1 + 1 = 17 meters, because you add 1 meter to both ends.\n\nSimilarly, the width side becomes 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 meters.\n\nSo, the new perimeter is 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 54 meters.\n\nBut if I think about the original perimeter being 2 \u00d7 (15 + 8) = 46 meters, and the new perimeter is 54 meters, the difference is 8 meters.\n\nBut if I consider that I'm adding 1 meter to each side, and there are four sides, so adding 4 meters in total, but actually, it's adding 8 meters.\n\nSo, my initial intuition is wrong.\n\nLet me think about what's really happening.\n\nWhen you add 1 meter to all sides outward, you are effectively increasing each side by 2 meters.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, for each side, you're adding 1 meter outward, which affects both the length and the width.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of expanding the rectangle by 1 meter in all directions.\n\nSo, the new rectangle is enlarged by 1 meter on all sides.\n\nTherefore, the length increases by 2 meters (1 meter on each end), and the width increases by 2 meters (1 meter on each side).\n\nTherefore, the new perimeter is 2 \u00d7 (15 + 2 + 8 + 2) = 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 54 meters.\n\nSo, the perimeter increases by 8 meters, which makes sense because you're adding 1 meter on each side, but since each side is connected, the total addition to the perimeter is more than just 4 meters.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, when you add 1 meter outward to each side, you're adding 1 meter to each side's length.\n\nBut in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so adding 1 meter to each side means:\n\n- For the two length sides: each increases by 1 meter, so total addition is 2 meters.\n\n- For the two width sides: each increases by 1 meter, so total addition is 2 meters.\n\n- Therefore, total addition to the perimeter is 4 meters.\n\nBut according to the calculation, the perimeter increases by 8 meters.\n\nSo, there must be something wrong with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that adding 1 meter outward on all sides affects the corners as well, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate the perimeter of the original garden and the perimeter of the buffer zone separately and then add them up.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the buffer is around the garden, so the fencing will be along the outer edge of the buffer.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nThe fencing is built around the garden with an additional 1-meter buffer on all sides, meaning the fence is 1 meter outside the garden on all sides.\n\nSo, the fencing surrounds the garden plus the buffer zone.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the area to be fenced is the perimeter of the garden plus twice the buffer width for length and width.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, since the buffer is 1 meter on all sides, the fencing will be 1 meter outside the garden on all sides.\n\nTherefore, for each side, the fencing is 1 meter outside.\n\nSo, for the length sides, each becomes 15 + 2 = 17 meters (1 meter on each end).\n\nSimilarly, for the width sides, each becomes 8 + 2 = 10 meters (1 meter on each side).\n\nTherefore, the total perimeter is 2 \u00d7 17 + 2 \u00d7 10 = 34 + 20 = 54 meters.\n\nSo, the correct amount of fencing needed is 54 meters.\n\nEarlier confusion came from mistakenly thinking that adding 1 meter to all sides would simply add 4 meters to the original perimeter, but that's not the case.\n\nIn reality, adding 1 meter outward on all sides affects both the length and the width, increasing each by 2 meters (1 meter on each end or side).\n\nTherefore, the total perimeter increases by 8 meters (2 meters for length and 2 meters for width, multiplied by two sides each), from 46 meters to 54 meters.\n\nSo, the final answer is 54 meters of fencing needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
