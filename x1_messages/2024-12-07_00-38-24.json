We have a car that's traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, and then it speeds up to 80 miles per hour for another 2 hours. We need to find out the total distance it travels.\n\nFirst, I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part of the trip, the car is going 60 mph for 3 hours. That should be pretty straightforward.\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nAlright, that makes sense. Now, for the second part of the trip, the car increases its speed to 80 mph and travels for another 2 hours.\n\nSo, Distance\u2082 = 80 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 160 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, I just need to add these two distances together.\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 180 miles + 160 miles = 340 miles\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst part: 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond part: 80 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 160 miles \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAdding them up: 180 + 160 = 340 miles \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved, like acceleration or something. But the problem says the car travels at a constant speed for each segment, so I don't think I need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The speed is in miles per hour and the time is in hours, so multiplying them gives miles, which is what we want for distance.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the formula for average speed or something like that. But since the speeds are different for different intervals, and the times are specified, the straightforward approach of calculating each segment separately and adding them up seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to calculate the average speed over the entire trip, I could do that and then multiply by the total time, but that might be more complicated for this scenario.\n\nLet's see: total distance is 340 miles, total time is 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours. So the average speed would be total distance divided by total time: 340 miles / 5 hours = 68 mph.\n\nBut that's not required for this problem. The question is only asking for the total distance traveled, which I've calculated as 340 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to be completely sure, let me see if there's any possibility that I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe if the car increased its speed gradually from 60 to 80 mph, but the problem says it travels at a constant speed of 60 mph for 3 hours and then increases to 80 mph for another 2 hours. So, it's two separate segments with different constant speeds.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. The speed is given in miles per hour and time in hours, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer. The total distance traveled is 340 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{340} \\]"
