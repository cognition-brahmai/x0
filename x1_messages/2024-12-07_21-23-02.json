        "content": "Let's see. John reads 2 books every month. There are 12 months in a year. So, to find out how many books he reads in a year, I need to multiply the number of books he reads each month by the number of months in a year.\n\nSo, that's 2 books/month \u00d7 12 months/year.\n\nLet me do the math: 2 \u00d7 12 equals 24.\n\nTherefore, John will read 24 books in a year.\n\nWait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by thinking about how many books he reads every few months and then adding them up.\n\nFor example, in 3 months, he reads 2 books/month \u00d7 3 months = 6 books.\n\nSo in 4 sets of 3 months, that\u2019s 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 books.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nOr, maybe think about it in terms of quarters. There are 4 quarters in a year, each consisting of 3 months.\n\nIn each quarter, he reads 2 books/month \u00d7 3 months = 6 books.\n\nSo, 4 quarters \u00d7 6 books/quarter = 24 books.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nWhat if he reads the same number of books every year? How many books would he read in 5 years?\n\nWell, if he reads 24 books/year, then in 5 years, it would be 24 books/year \u00d7 5 years = 120 books.\n\nBut the question is only asking for one year, so 24 books is the answer.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider here? Like, does he read more books in some months than others? The question says he reads 2 books every month, so it\u2019s consistent.\n\nAlright, I think 24 books is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
