Multiply the monthly revenue by the number of months in a year to get the annual revenue.\n\nFirst, let's find out the monthly revenue.\n\nGiven:\n- Number of cars: 250\n- Average rental days per car per month: 15\n- Rental rate per day per car: $50\n\nMonthly revenue can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Monthly Revenue} = \\text{Number of Cars} \\times \\text{Average Rental Days per Month} \\times \\text{Rental Rate per Day} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ \\text{Monthly Revenue} = 250 \\times 15 \\times 50 \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\nFirst, multiply the number of cars by the average rental days per month:\n\\[ 250 \\times 15 = 3750 \\]\n\nThen, multiply the result by the rental rate per day:\n\\[ 3750 \\times 50 = 187,500 \\]\n\nSo, the monthly revenue is $187,500.\n\nNow, to find the annual revenue, we multiply the monthly revenue by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = \\text{Monthly Revenue} \\times 12 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = 187,500 \\times 12 \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\\[ 187,500 \\times 12 = 2,250,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the company generates $2,250,000 in revenue in one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2250000} \\]"
