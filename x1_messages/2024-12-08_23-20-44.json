Here's a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `factorial` with the desired non-negative integer as the argument. For example, `factorial(5)` will return the factorial of 5, which is 120."
