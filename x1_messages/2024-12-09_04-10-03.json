        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x + 5 = 17. I need to find out what x is. Okay, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the goal is to isolate x, which means I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. The equation right now is 3x + 5 = 17. So, there's something being added to 3x, which is 5. To get rid of that +5, I should do the opposite, which is subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. That way, it stays balanced.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5\n\nOn the left side, +5 and -5 cancel each other out, so I'm left with 3x. On the right side, 17 minus 5 is 12. So now the equation is:\n\n3x = 12\n\nAlright, now I need to get x by itself. Currently, x is being multiplied by 3. To undo that, I should divide both sides by 3. So:\n\n3x / 3 = 12 / 3\n\nOn the left side, 3 divided by 3 is 1, so it's just x. On the right side, 12 divided by 3 is 4. So now I have:\n\nx = 4\n\nWait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me substitute x = 4 back into the original equation to verify.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 5 = 17\n\nPlugging in x = 4: 3*(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17\n\nYes, that checks out. So, x = 4 is the correct solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the properties of equality here. The addition property of equality says that if I add or subtract the same number from both sides, the equation remains true. Similarly, the multiplication property of equality says that if I multiply or divide both sides by the same non-zero number, the equation remains true. That's what I did: subtracted 5 from both sides and then divided both sides by 3.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other possible solutions. In this case, since it's a linear equation, there should only be one solution. So, x = 4 is the only answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about what the equation represents. For example, 3x + 5 = 17 could represent a situation where someone has some number of items, triples that number, adds 5 more, and ends up with 17. To find out how many items they started with, you'd solve for x, which is 4 in this case.\n\nAlternatively, I could graph both sides of the equation and find where they intersect. The left side is y = 3x + 5, and the right side is y = 17. Plotting these, y = 3x + 5 is a straight line with a slope of 3 and a y-intercept at 5, while y = 17 is a horizontal line at y = 17. The point where these two lines intersect would be the solution, which should be at x = 4, y = 17.\n\nBut since this is a simple equation, maybe graphing is overkill. Anyway, I've confirmed my answer algebraically and by substitution, so I'm confident that x = 4 is correct.\n\nOne more thing: I should make sure that there are no restrictions or special cases here. For example, if there were variables in the denominator or something, I might have to worry about undefined expressions. But in this case, it's just a straightforward linear equation, so no worries there.\n\nAll right, I think that's enough. The answer is x = 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
