        "content": "So the factory normally produces 1000 widgets in 8 hours. If they boost their production rate by 50%, how many widgets will they make in 10 hours? Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the original production rate. That would be the number of widgets produced per hour. So, 1000 widgets in 8 hours means their rate is 1000 divided by 8, which is 125 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, they're increasing that rate by 50%. To find the new rate, I'll take 125 and increase it by 50%. Fifty percent of 125 is 62.5, so adding that to the original 125 gives me a new rate of 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many widgets they'll produce in 10 hours at this new rate. That should be straightforward: just multiply the new rate by the number of hours. So, 187.5 widgets per hour times 10 hours equals 1875 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the total production time and the scaling factors. If they increase their production rate by 50%, that's like multiplying the original rate by 1.5. And they're working for 10 hours instead of 8. So, the total production should be the original production multiplied by the scaling factors for rate and time.\n\nOriginal production is 1000 widgets in 8 hours. The new rate is 1.5 times the original rate, and the new time is 10 hours. So, the new production should be 1000 multiplied by (10/8) and by 1.5.\n\nLet's calculate that: 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. So, 1000 times 1.25 is 1250. Then, 1250 times 1.5 is 1875 widgets.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it looks like the factory will produce 1875 widgets in 10 hours at the increased production rate.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of worker productivity. Suppose the factory has a certain number of workers, and they're each producing at a certain rate. If the production rate per worker increases by 50%, and the number of workers stays the same, then the total production increases by 50%.\n\nBut in this case, they're also working longer, from 8 hours to 10 hours. So, the increase in time is from 8 to 10, which is an increase of 2 hours, or 25% more time (since 2 is 25% of 8).\n\nBut wait, that might not be the best way to think about it. Maybe it's better to stick with the rate multiplied by time.\n\nAlternatively, consider that at the original rate, they produce 125 widgets per hour. Increasing that by 50% gives 187.5 widgets per hour, and over 10 hours, that's 1875 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the original production over 8 hours being 1000 widgets, then in 10 hours at the original rate, they would produce 1000 * (10/8) = 1250 widgets. Then, increasing that by 50% gives 1250 * 1.5 = 1875 widgets.\n\nWait, that's the same as my second approach earlier, and it confirms the answer again.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's consider the units. The rate is widgets per hour, and time is in hours, so multiplying them gives widgets, which is what we want.\n\nAlso, since 50% is equivalent to half, increasing the rate by 50% should make it one and a half times the original rate, which is what I did.\n\nMoreover, 1875 seems to be a reasonable number: it's more than the original 1000, considering they're working longer and faster.\n\nI can also check the arithmetic: 125 times 8 is 1000, and 125 plus 62.5 is 187.5, and 187.5 times 10 is indeed 1875.\n\nSo, I think 1875 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1875} \\]"
