        "content": "So the hotel chain is planning to build a new resort on a tropical island, and they're offering three types of accommodations: standard rooms, suites, and villas. Each standard room can hold up to 2 guests, suites up to 4, and villas up to 6. Their goal is to accommodate at least 1,000 guests, but with a condition that no more than 40% of the guests stay in standard rooms. I need to figure out the minimum number of each type of accommodation required to meet these criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. The main constraints are:\n\n1. Total accommodation should be at least 1,000 guests.\n\n2. No more than 40% of the guests should be in standard rooms.\n\nAlso, I need to find the minimum number of each type of accommodation, which probably means minimizing the total number of rooms while satisfying the above constraints.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this easier:\n\n- Let \\( r \\) be the number of standard rooms.\n\n- Let \\( s \\) be the number of suites.\n\n- Let \\( v \\) be the number of villas.\n\nEach standard room holds up to 2 guests, so the total number of guests in standard rooms is \\( 2r \\).\n\nEach suite holds up to 4 guests, so the total number of guests in suites is \\( 4s \\).\n\nEach villa holds up to 6 guests, so the total number of guests in villas is \\( 6v \\).\n\nThe total number of guests accommodated is \\( 2r + 4s + 6v \\), and this needs to be at least 1,000:\n\n\\[ 2r + 4s + 6v \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\nAlso, no more than 40% of the guests should be in standard rooms. So, the number of guests in standard rooms should be no more than 40% of the total number of guests.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of guests as \\( g \\), where \\( g = 2r + 4s + 6v \\).\n\nThen, the condition is:\n\n\\[ 2r \\leq 0.4g \\]\n\nBut since \\( g = 2r + 4s + 6v \\), we can substitute:\n\n\\[ 2r \\leq 0.4(2r + 4s + 6v) \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify this inequality:\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ r \\leq 0.4(r + 2s + 3v) \\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[ r \\leq 0.4r + 0.8s + 1.2v \\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.4r \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.6r \\leq 0.8s + 1.2v \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 0.2 to simplify:\n\n\\[ 3r \\leq 4s + 6v \\]\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\n1. \\( 2r + 4s + 6v \\geq 1,000 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3r \\leq 4s + 6v \\)\n\nI need to find the smallest integers \\( r \\), \\( s \\), and \\( v \\) that satisfy these inequalities.\n\nTo minimize the number of rooms, I should maximize the number of guests per room, which means prioritizing villas, then suites, then standard rooms.\n\nHowever, the constraint \\( 3r \\leq 4s + 6v \\) adds a bit of complexity.\n\nLet me try to express \\( r \\) in terms of \\( s \\) and \\( v \\) from the second inequality:\n\n\\[ 3r \\leq 4s + 6v \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\]\n\nNow, considering the first inequality:\n\n\\[ 2r + 4s + 6v \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\nI can substitute the expression for \\( r \\) from the second inequality into the first one, but I need to find a way to minimize the total number of rooms, which is \\( r + s + v \\).\n\nThis seems like a linear programming problem, but since we're dealing with integer numbers of rooms, it's actually an integer linear programming problem.\n\nTo make it simpler, perhaps I can assume certain values and see what works.\n\nLet\u2019s consider maximizing the number of villas and suites, since they hold more guests per room, and minimize standard rooms.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that we have only suites and villas, i.e., \\( r = 0 \\).\n\nThen, the inequalities become:\n\n1. \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 1,000 \\)\n\n2. \\( 0 \\leq 4s + 6v \\), which is always true since numbers of rooms can't be negative.\n\nSo, the only constraint is \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 1,000 \\).\n\nTo minimize the number of rooms \\( s + v \\), we should maximize the number of villas, since they hold more guests per room.\n\nLet\u2019s see how many villas are needed if we use only villas:\n\nEach villa holds 6 guests, so the number of villas needed is \\( v \\geq \\lceil 1000 / 6 \\rceil = 167 \\).\n\nBut \\( 167 \\times 6 = 1,002 \\), which is just over 1,000.\n\nSo, with 167 villas, we have \\( 1,002 \\) guests, and no standard rooms, so the condition \\( r \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\) is automatically satisfied since \\( r = 0 \\).\n\nBut, is this the minimum total number of rooms?\n\nWait, maybe mixing suites and villas can reduce the total number of rooms.\n\nLet\u2019s see.\n\nSuppose we use both suites and villas.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of rooms as \\( s + v \\), and the total number of guests as \\( 4s + 6v \\).\n\nWe need \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 1,000 \\), and we want to minimize \\( s + v \\).\n\nTo minimize \\( s + v \\), given \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 1,000 \\), we should maximize \\( v \\), since villas have a higher guest per room ratio.\n\nThe more villas we have, the fewer total rooms are needed.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for \\( s \\) in terms of \\( v \\):\n\nFrom \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 1,000 \\), we get \\( s \\geq \\frac{1,000 - 6v}{4} \\).\n\nSince \\( s \\) must be an integer and non-negative, we take the ceiling of \\( \\frac{1,000 - 6v}{4} \\).\n\nThe total number of rooms is \\( s + v \\), so we want to minimize \\( s + v = \\lceil \\frac{1,000 - 6v}{4} \\rceil + v \\).\n\nThis seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can try different values of \\( v \\) and find the corresponding \\( s \\) that minimizes \\( s + v \\).\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( v = 167 \\):\n\nThen, \\( 6 \\times 167 = 1,002 \\), which is greater than or equal to 1,000, so \\( s = 0 \\).\n\nTotal rooms: \\( 0 + 167 = 167 \\).\n\nNow, try \\( v = 166 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 166 = 996 \\), which is less than 1,000.\n\nSo, \\( s \\geq \\frac{1,000 - 996}{4} = 1 \\).\n\nThus, \\( s = 1 \\), and total rooms: \\( 1 + 166 = 167 \\).\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, try \\( v = 165 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 165 = 990 \\), which is less than 1,000.\n\nSo, \\( s \\geq \\frac{1,000 - 990}{4} = 2.5 \\), which rounds up to \\( s = 3 \\).\n\nTotal rooms: \\( 3 + 165 = 168 \\), which is worse.\n\nSimilarly, \\( v = 168 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 168 = 1,008 \\), which is greater than 1,000.\n\n\\( s = 0 \\), total rooms: 168, which is worse.\n\nWait, but earlier with \\( v = 167 \\) or \\( v = 166 \\), total rooms are 167.\n\nSo, 167 seems to be the minimum when \\( r = 0 \\).\n\nBut, perhaps including some standard rooms can allow for fewer total rooms.\n\nWait, but standard rooms hold fewer guests, so including them might require more rooms.\n\nBut let's check.\n\nSuppose we include some standard rooms.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that standard rooms can hold up to 2 guests, suites up to 4, and villas up to 6.\n\nIf I include standard rooms, I need to make sure that the total number of guests is at least 1,000, and that \\( r \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\).\n\nLet\u2019s see if including some standard rooms can reduce the total number of rooms.\n\nSuppose I set \\( r = 50 \\), then \\( 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\) guests in standard rooms.\n\nThen, the remaining guests needed are \\( 1,000 - 100 = 900 \\) guests to be accommodated in suites and villas.\n\nSo, \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 900 \\).\n\nAlso, the condition \\( r \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\) becomes \\( 50 \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\), which implies \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 150 \\).\n\nBut since we already have \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 900 \\), this is automatically satisfied.\n\nNow, minimize \\( s + v \\) such that \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 900 \\).\n\nAgain, to minimize \\( s + v \\), maximize \\( v \\).\n\nLet\u2019s solve for \\( s \\):\n\n\\( s \\geq \\frac{900 - 6v}{4} \\).\n\nTake \\( v = 150 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 150 = 900 \\), so \\( s = 0 \\).\n\nTotal rooms: \\( 50 + 0 + 150 = 200 \\).\n\nWait, that's more than the previous 167 rooms.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( r = 100 \\):\n\nThen, \\( 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\) guests in standard rooms.\n\nRemaining guests: \\( 1,000 - 200 = 800 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 800 \\).\n\nAlso, \\( r \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\) becomes \\( 100 \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\), which implies \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 300 \\).\n\nBut since we have \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 800 \\), this is already satisfied.\n\nMinimize \\( s + v \\) with \\( 4s + 6v \\geq 800 \\).\n\nAgain, maximize \\( v \\).\n\nSet \\( v = 134 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 134 = 804 \\), so \\( s = 0 \\).\n\nTotal rooms: \\( 100 + 0 + 134 = 234 \\), which is worse.\n\nIt seems that including standard rooms increases the total number of rooms needed, which makes sense because standard rooms hold fewer guests.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total number of rooms is achieved when there are no standard rooms, with 167 villas and 0 suites, totaling 167 rooms.\n\nBut wait, earlier when \\( v = 166 \\), \\( s = 1 \\), total rooms are still 167.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better combination.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( v = 166 \\), \\( s = 1 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 166 + 4 \\times 1 = 996 + 4 = 1,000 \\), which meets the requirement.\n\nTotal rooms: 167.\n\nNow, if I try \\( v = 165 \\), \\( s = 3 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 165 + 4 \\times 3 = 990 + 12 = 1,002 \\), total rooms: 168.\n\nWorse.\n\n\\( v = 167 \\), \\( s = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 167 = 1,002 \\), total rooms: 167.\n\nSame as above.\n\nSo, 167 rooms is the minimum when only suites and villas are used.\n\nBut, the problem also allows for standard rooms, with the condition that no more than 40% of guests are in standard rooms.\n\nHowever, from the above, it seems that including standard rooms only increases the total number of rooms needed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total number of rooms is 167, with 167 villas and no suites or standard rooms.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a way to include some suites and fewer villas to reduce the total number of rooms.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, \\( v = 166 \\), \\( s = 1 \\), total rooms are still 167.\n\nSame as \\( v = 167 \\), \\( s = 0 \\).\n\nSo, 167 is the minimum.\n\nBut, perhaps mixing suites and villas can lead to a better combination.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that suites hold 4 guests, villas hold 6.\n\nThe guest per room ratio for suites is 4/1 = 4, for villas is 6/1 = 6.\n\nSo, villas are more efficient in terms of guests per room.\n\nTherefore, to minimize total rooms, we should maximize villas.\n\nHence, 167 villas is the minimal number of rooms.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a way to use a combination that requires fewer rooms.\n\nWait, maybe using some suites instead of villas can allow for fewer total rooms if we can get a better balance.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose \\( v = 166 \\), \\( s = 1 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 166 + 4 \\times 1 = 996 + 4 = 1,000 \\), total rooms: 167.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, \\( v = 165 \\), \\( s = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 165 + 4 \\times 2 = 990 + 8 = 998 \\), which is less than 1,000.\n\nNeed at least 1,000, so this doesn't work.\n\n\\( v = 165 \\), \\( s = 3 \\):\n\n\\( 990 + 12 = 1,002 \\), total rooms: 168.\n\nWorse.\n\n\\( v = 164 \\), \\( s = 4 \\):\n\n\\( 6 \\times 164 + 4 \\times 4 = 984 + 16 = 1,000 \\), total rooms: 168.\n\nStill 168.\n\nSeems like 167 is the minimal total number of rooms.\n\nNow, considering that the problem allows for standard rooms, but with the constraint that no more than 40% of guests are in standard rooms.\n\nBut from the above, it seems that including standard rooms only increases the total number of rooms needed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total number of rooms is 167, with 167 villas and no suites or standard rooms.\n\nBut, perhaps I should check if a smaller total number of rooms is possible by including standard rooms in a specific way.\n\nSuppose I set \\( v = 166 \\), \\( s = 1 \\), \\( r = 1 \\):\n\nThen, total guests: \\( 6 \\times 166 + 4 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 1 = 996 + 4 + 2 = 1,002 \\), which is acceptable.\n\nCheck the condition: \\( r \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\):\n\n\\( 1 \\leq \\frac{4 \\times 1 + 6 \\times 166}{3} = \\frac{4 + 996}{3} = \\frac{1,000}{3} \\approx 333.33 \\), which is true.\n\nTotal rooms: \\( 166 + 1 + 1 = 168 \\), which is more than 167.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations seem to result in equal or higher total rooms.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total number of rooms is 167, achieved with 167 villas and no suites or standard rooms.\n\nBut, the problem asks for the minimal number of each accommodation type required to meet the criteria.\n\nSo, the minimal number of each type would be:\n\n- Standard rooms: 0\n\n- Suites: 0\n\n- Villas: 167\n\nHowever, perhaps there are other combinations with some standard rooms and suites that also result in 167 total rooms but have different distributions.\n\nLet\u2019s check.\n\nSuppose \\( v = 166 \\), \\( s = 1 \\), \\( r = 0 \\): total rooms 167.\n\nAnother combination is \\( v = 165 \\), \\( s = 3 \\), \\( r = 0 \\): total rooms 168.\n\nWait, but that's more than 167.\n\nAlternatively, \\( v = 164 \\), \\( s = 4 \\), \\( r = 0 \\): total rooms 168.\n\nSeems 167 is the minimal total.\n\nNow, considering that the problem allows for standard rooms, but with the constraint on the percentage of guests in standard rooms, perhaps there are combinations with some standard rooms that still result in 167 total rooms.\n\nSuppose \\( v = 166 \\), \\( s = 1 \\), \\( r = 0 \\): total rooms 167.\n\nIf I add one standard room, I need to adjust the number of suites and villas accordingly.\n\nSuppose \\( v = 166 \\), \\( s = 1 \\), \\( r = 1 \\): total rooms 168.\n\nTotal guests: 1,002.\n\nCheck the condition: \\( r \\leq \\frac{4s + 6v}{3} \\), which is \\( 1 \\leq \\frac{4 + 996}{3} = \\frac{1,000}{3} \\approx 333.33 \\), which holds.\n\nBut total rooms increased to 168.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations with standard rooms seem to increase the total number of rooms.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total number of rooms is 167, achieved with 167 villas and no suites or standard rooms.\n\nBut, perhaps the problem expects to find the minimal number of each type, meaning the minimal possible number for each type, not necessarily the minimal total number of rooms.\n\nIn that case, we need to find the minimal number of standard rooms, suites, and villas such that the total accommodation is at least 1,000 guests, with no more than 40% in standard rooms.\n\nLet\u2019s approach it differently.\n\nFirst, determine the maximal number of guests allowed in standard rooms: 40% of total guests.\n\nLet\u2019s denote total guests as \\( g \\), with \\( g \\geq 1,000 \\).\n\nThen, guests in standard rooms \\( \\leq 0.4g \\).\n\nSince \\( g = 2r + 4s + 6v \\), we have \\( 2r \\leq 0.4g \\).\n\nWhich implies \\( r \\leq 0.2g \\).\n\nBut \\( g \\geq 1,000 \\), so \\( r \\leq 0.2 \\times 1,000 = 200 \\).\n\nSo, maximal number of standard rooms is 200.\n\nBut we need to minimize the number of each type.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal number of each type, meaning the least possible number for each type, while satisfying the total accommodation and the percentage constraint.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the minimal number of standard rooms is 0, minimal number of suites is 0, and minimal number of villas is 167, as previously determined.\n\nAlternatively, if the minimal number for each type is at least 1, then it would be 1 standard room, 0 suites, and enough villas to make up the rest.\n\nBut, the problem doesn't specify that each type must be at least 1; it just says \"determine the minimal number of each accommodation type required to meet these criteria.\"\n\nSo, the minimal number could be 0 for standard rooms and suites, and 167 for villas.\n\nBut, perhaps the intent is to have at least some of each type.\n\nIn that case, we need to find the minimal number where each type is at least a certain minimum, but since it's not specified, perhaps 0 is acceptable for standard rooms and suites.\n\nHowever, to ensure that all types are considered, perhaps the hotel wants to have some of each type.\n\nBut, based on the problem statement, it's not mandatory.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of each accommodation type required to meet the criteria is:\n\n- Standard rooms: 0\n\n- Suites: 0\n\n- Villas: 167\n\nThis configuration meets the total accommodation requirement of at least 1,000 guests (actually providing 1,002 guests) and satisfies the condition that no more than 40% of guests are in standard rooms (since there are no standard rooms, this condition is trivially satisfied).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Standard rooms: } 0, \\text{ Suites: } 0, \\text{ Villas: } 167} \\]"
