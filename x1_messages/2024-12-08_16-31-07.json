        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There are 50 red balls and 50 blue balls in a box. I need to draw balls without looking at them, and I want to make sure that I have at least 3 balls of the same color. The question is, what's the minimum number of balls I must draw to ensure that?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I know that there are only two colors: red and blue, and there are equal numbers of each, 50 each. I need to draw balls without looking, which means I don't know which color I'm getting until it's drawn. But I need to ensure that among the balls I draw, at least 3 are the same color.\n\nFirst, I should think about the worst-case scenario because that will help me determine the minimum number required to guarantee that I have at least 3 of the same color.\n\nSo, the worst-case scenario would be that I draw as many balls as possible without getting 3 of the same color. That means I could draw up to 2 red and 2 blue balls without having 3 of the same color. But as soon as I draw the third ball, regardless of its color, it will make it 3 of one color.\n\nWait, but if I draw 2 red and 2 blue, that's 4 balls, and none of them make up 3 of the same color. So, the next ball I draw, the fifth one, will either be red or blue, making it 3 of one color.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Could there be a scenario where I draw more than 4 balls without getting 3 of the same color? Well, no, because after 4 balls (2 red and 2 blue), any additional ball will make it 3 of one color.\n\nBut wait, what if I draw 3 red and 1 blue? That already has 3 red, so I would have met the condition earlier. Similarly, 3 blue and 1 red would also meet the condition. But in the worst case, I could have 2 red and 2 blue before drawing the fifth ball.\n\nSo, to ensure that I have at least 3 of the same color, I need to draw at least 5 balls.\n\nLet me consider another angle. This seems similar to the pigeonhole principle, where the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors, and the \"pigeons\" are the balls drawn.\n\nThe pigeonhole principle states that if you have n holes and more than n items, at least one hole will contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, there are 2 colors (holes), and I want at least 3 balls of the same color (pigeons in one hole).\n\nSo, applying the pigeonhole principle:\n\nIf I draw 2 * (3 - 1) + 1 = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5 balls, then at least one color will have 3 balls.\n\nYes, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I draw 4 balls, it's possible to have 2 red and 2 blue, which doesn't satisfy the condition of having at least 3 of the same color.\n\nHowever, when I draw the fifth ball, it must be either red or blue, making it 3 red or 3 blue.\n\nTherefore, 5 is the minimum number of balls I must draw to ensure that I have at least 3 of the same color.\n\nWait a minute, what if I'm extremely lucky and draw 3 red balls in a row first? Then, I've met the condition with only 3 draws. But the question is about the minimum number that guarantees the condition, not the minimum number possible in the best case.\n\nSo, I need to consider the worst-case scenario, which, as I thought earlier, is drawing 2 red and 2 blue before drawing the fifth ball.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that in the worst case, I alternate colors or delay getting 3 of the same color as much as possible.\n\nSo, drawing 2 red and 2 blue achieves that, and the next draw ensures that I have 3 of one color.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider larger numbers. If there were more balls of each color, say 100 red and 100 blue, would the logic change?\n\nNo, because the color distribution doesn't affect the minimum number needed to ensure the condition, as long as there are at least 3 of each color in the box.\n\nIn this problem, there are 50 of each, which is more than enough.\n\nIf there were only 2 red and 2 blue, then drawing 3 would guarantee 3 of the same color, but since there are more, the worst-case scenario allows for drawing more without meeting the condition.\n\nWait, no. If there were only 2 red and 2 blue, drawing 3 would guarantee 3 of one color, because you can't draw 3 without getting at least one color three times, but in that case, you can't draw more than 4 balls.\n\nIn this problem, with 50 of each, you can draw up to 4 balls without getting 3 of the same color, but the fifth draw guarantees it.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5.\n\nBut let me consider another similar problem to see if my logic holds.\n\nSuppose there are 10 red balls and 10 blue balls. What's the minimum number to ensure at least 3 of the same color?\n\nUsing the same logic: worst case is drawing 2 red and 2 blue, then the fifth draw ensures 3 of one color.\n\nSo, still 5.\n\nWhat if there are 2 red and 2 blue? Then drawing 3 ensures 3 of one color, because the third draw must be the third of one color.\n\nBut in this problem, with 50 of each, the worst case is drawing 2 red and 2 blue, then the fifth draw guarantees 3 of one color.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, but I feel like there's a general formula for this.\n\nYes, in the pigeonhole principle, to guarantee that you have at least k items in one hole, you need to draw (k-1) * n + 1, where n is the number of holes.\n\nIn this case, n=2 (red and blue), k=3.\n\nSo, (3-1)*2 + 1 = 2*2 +1 = 5.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of balls to draw to ensure at least 3 of the same color is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
