        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 10 houses in a row, and each one can be painted either red or blue. But there's a catch: no two adjacent houses can be the same color. That means if one house is red, the next one has to be blue, and vice versa.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many different ways to paint these houses under this condition. It seems like a classic problem in combinatorics, which is the branch of mathematics dealing with counting and arrangements.\n\nLet's start with smaller numbers to see if I can find a pattern or a formula that can be applied to 10 houses.\n\nSuppose there is only 1 house. Then, it can be either red or blue, so there are 2 possibilities.\n\nNow, if there are 2 houses. The first house can be red or blue (2 options), and the second house must be the opposite color of the first one (1 option). So, total ways are 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nWait, but let's list them out:\n\n1. Red, Blue\n\n2. Blue, Red\n\nSo, yes, 2 ways.\n\nNow, for 3 houses:\n\n- First house: Red\n\n- Second house: Blue\n\n- Third house: Red\n\n- First house: Blue\n\n- Second house: Red\n\n- Third house: Blue\n\nSo, the possibilities are:\n\n1. Red, Blue, Red\n\n2. Blue, Red, Blue\n\nAgain, 2 ways.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for 3 houses:\n\n- First house: 2 options (Red or Blue)\n\n- Second house: 1 option (opposite of first)\n\n- Third house: 1 option (opposite of second)\n\nSo, it should be 2 * 1 * 1 = 2 ways.\n\nBut let's list them:\n\n1. Red, Blue, Red\n\n2. Blue, Red, Blue\n\nYes, only 2 ways.\n\nHmm, but this seems off because for 1 house it's 2, for 2 houses it's 2, for 3 houses it's 2... suggesting it's always 2 regardless of the number of houses. That can't be right.\n\nLet me try with 4 houses.\n\n- First house: 2 options (R or B)\n\n- Second house: 1 option (opposite of first)\n\n- Third house: 1 option (opposite of second)\n\n- Fourth house: 1 option (opposite of third)\n\nSo, it should be 2 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 2 ways.\n\nBut listing them:\n\n1. Red, Blue, Red, Blue\n\n2. Blue, Red, Blue, Red\n\nAgain, only 2 ways.\n\nThis is confusing. Is it really only 2 ways no matter how many houses there are?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let's consider that the color alternates strictly between houses.\n\nIf the first house is Red, then the second must be Blue, the third Red, and so on, alternating until the tenth house.\n\nSimilarly, if the first house is Blue, then the second is Red, the third Blue, and so on.\n\nSo, regardless of the number of houses, there are only 2 possible patterns: starting with Red and alternating, or starting with Blue and alternating.\n\nTherefore, for 10 houses, there are only 2 ways to paint them such that no two adjacent houses are the same color.\n\nBut wait, is there a general formula for this?\n\nYes, in fact, this is similar to figuring out the number of ways to tile a board with two types of tiles, where no two adjacent tiles are the same.\n\nThe general formula for n houses is 2 * (1)^{(n-1)}\uff0c but that seems to just give 2 for any n, which matches what I've observed.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a binary sequence where no two adjacent digits are the same. For n bits, there are 2^(n) total sequences, but with the restriction, it's different.\n\nActually, the number of such sequences is 2 * (1)^{(n-1)}\uff0c which again is 2 for any n.\n\nBut maybe I should look at it recursively.\n\nLet\u2019s define A_n as the number of ways to paint n houses with the given condition.\n\nFor the first house, there are 2 choices: Red or Blue.\n\nFor the second house, there is only 1 choice: the opposite color of the first house.\n\nSimilarly, for each subsequent house, the color is determined by the previous house's color.\n\nTherefore, A_n = A_{n-1} * 1, since each new house has only 1 choice based on the previous house.\n\nBut A_1 = 2.\n\nSo, A_n = 2 * (1)^{(n-1)} = 2.\n\nThis suggests that for any n, there are only 2 ways.\n\nBut let's verify this with a smaller n.\n\nFor n=1: 2 ways (R or B). Correct.\n\nFor n=2: 2 ways (R-B or B-R). Correct.\n\nFor n=3: 2 ways (R-B-R or B-R-B). Correct.\n\nFor n=4: 2 ways (R-B-R-B or B-R-B-R). Correct.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, for 10 houses, there are 2 ways to paint them such that no two adjacent houses are the same color.\n\nBut wait, is there any other factor to consider? For example, what if the houses are in a circle, but in this problem, they are in a row.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that each house is painted either red or blue, with no two adjacent houses the same color.\n\nSo, yes, only 2 ways.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider that the color alternates strictly.\n\nSo, starting with Red, the sequence is Red, Blue, Red, Blue, ..., and starting with Blue, it's Blue, Red, Blue, Red, ...\n\nThus, only two possible sequences.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
