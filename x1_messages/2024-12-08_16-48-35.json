        "content": "So I've got this matrix:\n\n| 2  1 |\n\n| 1  2 |\n\nAnd I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I remember that eigenvalues are scalars that satisfy the equation (A - \u03bbI)v = 0, where A is the matrix, \u03bb is the eigenvalue, I is the identity matrix, and v is the eigenvector.\n\nFirst, I need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is the determinant of (A - \u03bbI) equals zero. So, let's compute A - \u03bbI.\n\nA - \u03bbI = | 2 - \u03bb   1    |\n\n         | 1     2 - \u03bb |\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix is (2 - \u03bb)(2 - \u03bb) - (1)(1) = (2 - \u03bb)^2 - 1.\n\nExpanding that, I get 4 - 4\u03bb + \u03bb^2 - 1 = \u03bb^2 - 4\u03bb + 3.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is \u03bb^2 - 4\u03bb + 3 = 0.\n\nTo solve for \u03bb, I can factor this quadratic equation: (\u03bb - 3)(\u03bb - 1) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 3 and \u03bb = 1.\n\nNow, for each eigenvalue, I need to find the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nLet's start with \u03bb = 3.\n\nI need to solve (A - 3I)v = 0.\n\nFirst, compute A - 3I:\n\nA - 3I = | 2 - 3   1    | = | -1   1  |\n\n         | 1     2 - 3 |   | 1   -1 |\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n-1*x + 1*y = 0\n\n1*x - 1*y = 0\n\nThese equations are dependent, so I can just use one of them. Let's use the first one: -x + y = 0, which implies y = x.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = 3 can be any scalar multiple of | 1 |\n\n                                                                                      | 1 |\n\nSo, one possible eigenvector is | 1 |\n\n                                 | 1 |\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvector for \u03bb = 1.\n\nI need to solve (A - I)v = 0.\n\nFirst, compute A - I:\n\nA - I = | 2 - 1   1    | = | 1   1  |\n\n       | 1     2 - 1 |   | 1   1 |\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n1*x + 1*y = 0\n\n1*x + 1*y = 0\n\nAgain, these equations are dependent, so I can use just one: x + y = 0, which implies y = -x.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = 1 can be any scalar multiple of | 1 |\n\n                                                                                      | -1 |\n\nSo, one possible eigenvector is | 1 |\n\n                                 | -1 |\n\nJust to double-check, let's verify these eigenvectors with the original matrix.\n\nFirst, for \u03bb = 3 and eigenvector | 1 |\n\n                                 | 1 |\n\nCompute A*v:\n\n| 2  1 | * | 1 | = | 2*1 + 1*1 | = | 3 |\n\n| 1  2 |   | 1 |   | 1*1 + 2*1 |   | 3 |\n\nWhich is 3 * | 1 | = | 3 |\n\n                | 1 |   | 3 |\n\nSo, it checks out.\n\nNow, for \u03bb = 1 and eigenvector | 1 |\n\n                                 | -1 |\n\nCompute A*v:\n\n| 2  1 | * | 1  | = | 2*1 + 1*(-1) | = | 1 |\n\n| 1  2 |   | -1 |   | 1*1 + 2*(-1) |   | -1 |\n\nWhich is 1 * | 1 | = | 1 |\n\n                  | -1 |   | -1 |\n\nPerfect, that checks out too.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are 3 and 1, with corresponding eigenvectors | 1 | and | 1 |, respectively.\n\n                                                          | 1 |     | -1 |\n\nI think that's it. If there's anything else I need to do, please let me know.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Eigenvalues: } 3 \\text{ and } 1, \\text{ with corresponding eigenvectors } \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}} \\]"
