        "content": "Yes, spinach is known for its high iron content. A 100-gram serving of spinach provides about 2.71 mg of iron, which is significant compared to many other vegetables. However, it's important to note that the iron in spinach is non-heme iron, which is not as easily absorbed by the body as heme iron found in animal products. To enhance iron absorption from spinach, it can be consumed with vitamin C-rich foods, as vitamin C helps in the absorption of non-heme iron."
