These labors were assigned to him by King Eurystheus as a penance for a crime he didn't commit, and they included challenges such as slaying the Nemean Lion, cleaning the Augean stables, and capturing the Erymanthian Boar, among others. Heracles is one of the most famous figures in Greek mythology, renowned for his extraordinary strength, courage, and adventures."
