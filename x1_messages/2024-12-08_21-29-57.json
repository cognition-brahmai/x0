He is best known for his theory of relativity, which fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and gravity. However, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, not for his work on relativity. The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a metal surface when light shines on it, and Einstein's theoretical explanation of this phenomenon was a cornerstone in the development of quantum theory.\n\nENDINPUT\n\n"
