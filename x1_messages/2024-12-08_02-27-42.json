        "content": "A rectangular garden has a length of 30 feet and a width of 20 feet. What is the area of the garden in square yards?\n\nFirst, I need to find the area of the garden in square feet and then convert that to square yards.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.\n\nSo, area in square feet = length \u00d7 width = 30 feet \u00d7 20 feet = 600 square feet.\n\nNow, I need to convert square feet to square yards. I know that 1 yard = 3 feet, so 1 square yard = 3 feet \u00d7 3 feet = 9 square feet.\n\nTherefore, to convert from square feet to square yards, I divide the area in square feet by 9.\n\nArea in square yards = area in square feet \u00f7 9 = 600 \u00f7 9 = 66.666... square yards.\n\nBut I should check if this is correct. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the dimensions from feet to yards before calculating the area.\n\nSince 1 yard = 3 feet, then:\n\nLength in yards = 30 feet \u00f7 3 = 10 yards.\n\nWidth in yards = 20 feet \u00f7 3 \u2248 6.666... yards.\n\nNow, area in square yards = length in yards \u00d7 width in yards = 10 \u00d7 6.666... \u2248 66.666... square yards.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's a formula to directly convert square feet to square yards.\n\nI recall that 1 square yard = 9 square feet, so the conversion factor is 1/9.\n\nTherefore, area in square yards = area in square feet \u00d7 (1/9), which again gives me 600 \u00d7 (1/9) = 66.666... square yards.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use unit conversions. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, then (1 yard)^2 = (3 feet)^2, so 1 square yard = 9 square feet.\n\nTherefore, to convert from square feet to square yards, I divide by 9.\n\nSo, again, 600 square feet \u00f7 9 = 66.666... square yards.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so the answer should be correct.\n\nPerhaps I can also verify this using metric conversions, but that might be unnecessary and could introduce errors due to conversion factors.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the definition of area in different units.\n\nIn any case, all methods point to the same result, so I'm satisfied that the area of the garden is approximately 66.67 square yards.\n\nWait, but the decimal goes on forever. Maybe I should express it as a fraction.\n\n600 divided by 9 is equal to 66 and 2/3, since 2/3 of 9 is 6, and 66 \u00d7 9 = 594, and 594 + 6 = 600.\n\nSo, 66 2/3 square yards is another way to express it.\n\nDepending on the context, the answer might be expected in decimal or fractional form.\n\nIf the question doesn't specify, either could be acceptable.\n\nBut since it's a real-world measurement, decimal might be more practical.\n\nHowever, in some contexts, fractions are preferred for exactness.\n\nIn this case, since 66.666... is a repeating decimal, expressing it as 66 2/3 might be more precise.\n\nBut for most practical purposes, rounding to two decimal places, such as 66.67 square yards, would suffice.\n\nAlternatively, some people might leave it as 66.67 square yards, understanding that it's an approximation.\n\nBut mathematically, 66 2/3 is exact.\n\nSo, perhaps I should present both options.\n\nTherefore, the area of the garden is 66 2/3 square yards or approximately 66.67 square yards.\n\nI think that covers all the possible ways to approach the problem and present the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66.\\overline{6} \\text{ square yards} \\text{ or } 66 \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ square yards}} \\]"
