Like Louisiana, which is named after Louis XIV of France, but that's not directly named after a city. Hmm, perhaps you're referring to something else? Let me think... There's a state in Canada called Newfoundland, but that's not in the South of America. Maybe you meant a territory or a region within a state that's named after a French city? It's a bit confusing. Could you please provide more clues or check the details?"
