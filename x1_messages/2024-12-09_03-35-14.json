        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a zoo expansion. They're planning to add three new sections: reptiles, birds, and aquatic animals. The total budget for this expansion is $12 million. The budget is allocated as follows: 35% for reptiles, 25% for birds, and 40% for aquatic animals. I need to calculate the individual budgets for each section and then estimate how many new species can be added to each exhibit based on the average cost per species.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much money is allocated to each section. Let's start with the reptiles. They get 35% of the total budget. So, I'll calculate 35% of $12 million.\n\nTo find 35% of $12 million, I can multiply 12,000,000 by 0.35.\n\n12,000,000 * 0.35 = 4,200,000\n\nSo, the reptile section gets $4,200,000.\n\nNext, for the birds, which get 25% of the total budget.\n\n12,000,000 * 0.25 = 3,000,000\n\nSo, the bird section gets $3,000,000.\n\nFinally, the aquatic animals get 40% of the total budget.\n\n12,000,000 * 0.40 = 4,800,000\n\nSo, the aquatic section gets $4,800,000.\n\nNow, I need to estimate how many new species can be added to each exhibit based on the average cost per species.\n\nFor reptiles, the average cost per species is $50,000.\n\nSo, the number of new reptile species that can be added is the reptile budget divided by the cost per species.\n\n4,200,000 / 50,000 = 84\n\nSo, they can add 84 new reptile species.\n\nFor birds, the average cost per species is $30,000.\n\n3,000,000 / 30,000 = 100\n\nSo, they can add 100 new bird species.\n\nFor aquatic animals, the average cost per species is $100,000.\n\n4,800,000 / 100,000 = 48\n\nSo, they can add 48 new aquatic animal species.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the budget allocations:\n\n- Reptiles: 35% of $12,000,000 is indeed $4,200,000.\n\n- Birds: 25% of $12,000,000 is $3,000,000.\n\n- Aquatic animals: 40% of $12,000,000 is $4,800,000.\n\nNow, dividing each section's budget by the average cost per species:\n\n- Reptiles: $4,200,000 / $50,000 = 84 species.\n\n- Birds: $3,000,000 / $30,000 = 100 species.\n\n- Aquatic animals: $4,800,000 / $100,000 = 48 species.\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, the zoo can add 84 new reptile species, 100 new bird species, and 48 new aquatic animal species with their expansion budget.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84 \\text{ reptile species}, 100 \\text{ bird species}, 48 \\text{ aquatic animal species}} \\]"
