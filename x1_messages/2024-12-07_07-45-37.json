        "content": "If you drive at a constant speed of 55 miles per hour for 3.5 hours, you can calculate the distance traveled using the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 55 miles/hour \u00d7 3.5 hours\n\nTo calculate this, first consider that 3.5 hours is the same as 3 hours and 30 minutes. So, you can break it down:\n\n- For the first 3 hours:\n\n55 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 165 miles\n\n- For the remaining 0.5 hour (30 minutes):\n\n55 miles/hour \u00d7 0.5 hours = 27.5 miles\n\nNow, add both parts together:\n\n165 miles + 27.5 miles = 192.5 miles\n\nTherefore, you will travel 192.5 miles.\n\nAlternatively, you can directly multiply 55 by 3.5:\n\n55 \u00d7 3.5 = 55 \u00d7 (3 + 0.5) = (55 \u00d7 3) + (55 \u00d7 0.5) = 165 + 27.5 = 192.5 miles\n\nSo, the total distance traveled is 192.5 miles."
