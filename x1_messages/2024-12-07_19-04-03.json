        "content": "This is a classic problem in probability that involves Bayes' theorem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the given information:\n\n1. **Prevalence of the disease:** 1 in every 1000 people have the disease. So, the probability that a randomly selected person has the disease is \\( P(D) = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001 \\).\n\n2. **Accuracy of the test:** The test is 99% accurate. This means that if a person has the disease, the test will correctly identify them as positive 99% of the time (true positive rate), and if a person does not have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as negative 99% of the time (true negative rate).\n\nFrom this, we can derive:\n\n- **True positive rate (sensitivity):** \\( P(T+ | D) = 0.99 \\)\n\n- **True negative rate (specificity):** \\( P(T- | D') = 0.99 \\), where \\( D' \\) is the event that the person does not have the disease.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that a person actually has the disease given that they tested positive, which is \\( P(D | T+) \\).\n\nTo find this, we can use Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[\nP(D | T+) = \\frac{P(T+ | D) \\cdot P(D)}{P(T+)}\n\\]\n\nWe already know \\( P(T+ | D) \\) and \\( P(D) \\), but we need to find \\( P(T+) \\), the total probability of testing positive. This can be found using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[\nP(T+) = P(T+ | D) \\cdot P(D) + P(T+ | D') \\cdot P(D')\n\\]\n\nWe know:\n\n- \\( P(D') = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999 \\)\n\n- \\( P(T+ | D') \\) is the false positive rate, which is \\( 1 - \\text{specificity} = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 \\)\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(T+) = (0.99 \\times 0.001) + (0.01 \\times 0.999) = 0.00099 + 0.00999 = 0.01098\n\\]\n\nNow, back to Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[\nP(D | T+) = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.001}{0.01098} = \\frac{0.00099}{0.01098} \\approx 0.09016 \\approx 9.02\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person who tests positive actually has the disease is approximately 9.02%.\n\nThis might seem surprisingly low, but it makes sense when you consider the low prevalence of the disease. Even with a highly accurate test, the number of false positives in a large population can be significant compared to the number of true positives.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider a population of 1,000,000 people:\n\n- Number of people with the disease: \\( 1,000,000 \\times 0.001 = 1,000 \\)\n\n- Number of people without the disease: \\( 1,000,000 - 1,000 = 999,000 \\)\n\n- True positives: \\( 1,000 \\times 0.99 = 990 \\)\n\n- False positives: \\( 999,000 \\times 0.01 = 9,990 \\)\n\n- Total positive tests: \\( 990 + 9,990 = 10,980 \\)\n\n- Therefore, the probability that a positive test is a true positive: \\( \\frac{990}{10,980} \\approx 0.09016 \\), which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThis example highlights the importance of considering disease prevalence and the potential for false positives when interpreting test results. It also emphasizes the need for confirmatory tests or further evaluation after an initial positive result."
