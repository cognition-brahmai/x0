        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people in the room: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, and Eve. Each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about Alice. She shakes hands with Bob, Carol, Dave, and Eve. That's 4 handshakes just for Alice.\n\nNext is Bob. He's already shaken hands with Alice, so he only needs to shake hands with Carol, Dave, and Eve. That's 3 more handshakes.\n\nThen Carol. She's shaken hands with Alice and Bob already, so she shakes hands with Dave and Eve. That's 2 more handshakes.\n\nAfter that, Dave. He's shaken hands with Alice, Bob, and Carol, so he only needs to shake hands with Eve. That's 1 more handshake.\n\nFinally, Eve has shaken hands with everyone, so no more handshakes for her.\n\nNow, if I add up all those handshakes: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing everyone out? I remember something about combinations. Like, choosing 2 people out of 5 to shake hands.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is how many you're choosing at a time.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 people, and k = 2 people per handshake.\n\nSo, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (120) / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by listing them out. So, there are 10 handshakes in total.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I can think about it another way. Each person shakes hands with 4 others, so 5 people times 4 handshakes each would be 20 handshakes. But that counts each handshake twice, once for each person involved, so I need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of unique handshakes.\n\nSo, 20 / 2 = 10 handshakes.\n\nAgain, that matches the previous results. So, I'm confident that the answer is 10 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
