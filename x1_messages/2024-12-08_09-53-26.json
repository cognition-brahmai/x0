        "content": "So I need to calculate the square root of 256 and then multiply that by 5. Alright, let's start with finding the square root of 256.\n\nI know that squaring a number means multiplying it by itself. So, to find the square root, I need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 256.\n\nLet me think about some squares I know:\n\n- 10 squared is 100.\n\n- 12 squared is 144.\n\n- 15 squared is 225.\n\n- 16 squared is 256.\n\nOh, wait! 16 times 16 is 256. So, the square root of 256 is 16.\n\nNow, I need to multiply that by 5. So, 16 multiplied by 5.\n\nWell, 10 times 5 is 50, and 6 times 5 is 30, so 50 plus 30 is 80.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 256 is 16, and 16 multiplied by 5 is 80.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider here? Hmm, maybe I should check if 256 has any other square roots. I know that positive numbers have two square roots, one positive and one negative. So, technically, the square roots of 256 are +16 and -16.\n\nBut, in most practical cases, especially when dealing with real-world measurements, we use the positive square root. So, I'll go with 16.\n\nJust to be thorough, if I take -16 and multiply it by -16, I get 256 as well, because negative times negative is positive.\n\nSo, both 16 and -16 are square roots of 256.\n\nBut for this problem, I think using the positive square root is sufficient.\n\nNow, multiplying 16 by 5 is straightforward. 16 times 5 is 80.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 5 times 16, which is also 80.\n\nLet me just double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\n16 times 5:\n\n5 times 6 is 30.\n\n5 times 10 is 50.\n\n30 plus 50 is 80.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 80.\n\nWait a minute, does the original problem specify anything else? Like, should I express the answer in a different form or units?\n\nHmm, no, it's just \"calculate the square root of 256 and then multiply it by 5.\"\n\nSo, I think 80 is the straightforward answer.\n\nBut, maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that multiplying the square root of a number by another number is the same as multiplying the number under the square root by the square of that number, and then taking the square root.\n\nHuh, let's see.\n\nSo, sqrt(256) * 5 = sqrt(256) * sqrt(25), because 5 is sqrt(25).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. sqrt(25) is 5, but multiplying sqrt(256) by 5 isn't the same as sqrt(256 * 25).\n\nActually, sqrt(a) * sqrt(b) = sqrt(a*b), but here I have sqrt(256) * 5, which isn't directly applying that rule.\n\nMaybe that's not the best approach.\n\nLet me consider another way.\n\nI know that 256 is a perfect square, specifically 16 squared.\n\nSo, sqrt(256) = 16.\n\nThen, 16 * 5 = 80.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about exponents, sqrt(256) is 256^(1/2), and then multiplying by 5 is the same as 5 * 256^(1/2).\n\nBut, again, since 256^(1/2) is 16, it's the same as before.\n\nI think I'm just confirming that the answer is indeed 80.\n\nIs there a chance that the problem wants me to consider the negative square root as well?\n\nWell, if I take -16 and multiply it by 5, I get -80.\n\nSo, technically, depending on the context, the answer could be +80 or -80.\n\nBut, unless specified otherwise, I think the positive value is what's expected.\n\nAlternatively, if this is part of a larger problem where negative values make sense, then both +80 and -80 could be possible answers.\n\nBut since the problem is standalone, I'll go with the positive value.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 256 multiplied by 5 is 80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
