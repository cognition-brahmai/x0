        "content": "So, let's see. The restaurant serves 150 customers per day on average, and each customer spends an average of $20. It's open for 360 days a year. I need to find out the annual revenue.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the daily revenue. If each customer spends $20 and there are 150 customers per day, then the daily revenue would be 150 customers times $20 per customer. That should give me the amount of money the restaurant makes each day.\n\nSo, 150 times 20. Let's calculate that. 150 times 20 is 3,000. So, the restaurant makes $3,000 per day.\n\nNow, to find the annual revenue, I need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days the restaurant is open in a year. It's open for 360 days a year, so 3,000 times 360 should give me the annual revenue.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3,000 times 360. Well, 3 times 36 is 108, and since there are two zeros in 3,000 and one zero in 360, that's a total of three zeros. So, 108 plus three zeros is 108,000.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that multiplication. 3,000 times 360.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down: 3,000 times 300 is 900,000, and 3,000 times 60 is 180,000. Adding those together, 900,000 plus 180,000 equals 1,080,000.\n\nSo, the annual revenue would be $1,080,000.\n\nBut, to make sure, let me verify the calculations again. Starting from the number of customers per day, which is 150, times the average spending per customer, which is $20, gives $3,000 per day.\n\nThen, multiplying $3,000 by 360 days gives $1,080,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in another way. Total annual revenue would be the number of customers per day times the average spending per customer times the number of days open per year.\n\nSo, that's 150 customers/day times $20/customer times 360 days/year.\n\nMultiplying those together: 150 times 20 is 3,000, times 360 is 1,080,000.\n\nAlternatively, 150 times 360 is 54,000 customers per year, times $20 per customer is $1,080,000.\n\nEither way, I end up with the same number, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nSo, the annual revenue of the restaurant is $1,080,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1080000} \\]"
