        "content": "Let's see. The train is going from Station A to Station B, and the distance between them is 180 kilometers. The train's speed is constant at 60 kilometers per hour. It leaves Station A at 2:00 PM, and I need to find out when it arrives at Station B.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how long the journey takes. Since speed is distance divided by time, or v = d/t, I can rearrange that to find time, which is t = d/v.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, t = 180 km / 60 km/h. That should give me the time it takes for the train to travel from A to B.\n\nLet me do the math: 180 divided by 60 is 3. So, the journey takes 3 hours.\n\nNow, if the train leaves at 2:00 PM and takes 3 hours, I just need to add 3 hours to the departure time to get the arrival time.\n\n2:00 PM plus 3 hours is 5:00 PM.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure about the units. The speed is in kilometers per hour, and the distance is in kilometers, so the time should indeed be in hours. Everything seems consistent.\n\nIs there any other factor I need to consider, like stops or anything? The problem says the train travels at a constant speed, so I assume it's a non-stop journey.\n\nAlright, so the train arrives at Station B at 5:00 PM.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nDistance: 180 km\n\nSpeed: 60 km/h\n\nTime: distance/speed = 180/60 = 3 hours\n\nDeparture time: 2:00 PM\n\nArrival time: 2:00 PM + 3 hours = 5:00 PM\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of how far the train travels each hour. At 60 km/h, it covers 60 kilometers every hour.\n\nSo, in the first hour, from 2:00 to 3:00 PM, it covers 60 km.\n\nFrom 3:00 to 4:00 PM, another 60 km, totaling 120 km.\n\nFrom 4:00 to 5:00 PM, another 60 km, totaling 180 km.\n\nSo, at 5:00 PM, it reaches Station B.\n\nWait, but 60 km/h means it's moving at a rate of 1 km per minute, right? Wait, no.\n\n60 kilometers per hour means it travels 60 kilometers in 60 minutes, which is 1 kilometer per minute.\n\nWait, that can't be right. 60 kilometers in 60 minutes is indeed 1 kilometer per minute.\n\nBut usually, trains don't travel at 1 kilometer per minute, because that's 60 kilometers per hour, which is approximately 37.3 miles per hour, which is a reasonable speed for a train.\n\nBut to be precise, 60 km/h is 60 kilometers in 60 minutes, so 1 kilometer per minute.\n\nSo, to cover 180 kilometers at 1 kilometer per minute, it would take 180 minutes.\n\n180 minutes is 3 hours, so again, arrival at 5:00 PM.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the speed in kilometers per minute, it's 1 km/min, but it's more straightforward to work in hours for this problem.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any time zone difference between the two stations, but since it's not mentioned, I'll assume they are in the same time zone.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if the train has any stops, but the problem states it's traveling at a constant speed, so I'll assume no stops.\n\nTherefore, the train arrives at Station B at 5:00 PM.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nIf the train is moving at 60 km/h, then in 3 hours, it covers 60 * 3 = 180 km, which matches the distance between the stations.\n\nSo, yes, 3 hours from 2:00 PM is 5:00 PM.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the formula for time, t = d/v, and plug in the values:\n\nt = 180 km / 60 km/h = 3 hours.\n\nAdding 3 hours to 2:00 PM gives 5:00 PM.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the units again.\n\nDistance is in kilometers, speed is in kilometers per hour, so time is in hours.\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to convert the speed to meters per second, I could do that, but it's unnecessary for this problem.\n\n60 km/h is 60,000 meters per hour, which is approximately 16.67 meters per second, but again, not necessary here.\n\nSo, sticking with the original units is fine.\n\nTherefore, the train arrives at Station B at 5:00 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5:00 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
