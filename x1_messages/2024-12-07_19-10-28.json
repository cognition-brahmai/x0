However, it's worth noting that while Bras\u00edlia is the capital, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are larger and more populous cities. Rio de Janeiro is famously known for its Christ the Redeemer statue, which is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The Amazon rainforest, on the other hand, spans across several regions of Brazil and is crucial for global biodiversity and climate regulation."
