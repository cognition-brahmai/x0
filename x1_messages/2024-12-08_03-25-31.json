        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the length is 20 meters and the width is 15 meters. I need to find two things: the area of the garden in square meters and the perimeter in meters.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the formulas for area and perimeter of a rectangle. I think the area is length times width, and the perimeter is something like twice the sum of length and width. Let me make sure I have that right.\n\nSo, for a rectangle, the area (A) is indeed calculated by multiplying the length (L) by the width (W). So, A = L \u00d7 W.\n\nGiven that the length (L) is 20 meters and the width (W) is 15 meters, plugging in the values should give me the area.\n\nA = 20m \u00d7 15m = 300 square meters.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, for the perimeter (P), the formula is P = 2 \u00d7 (L + W).\n\nSo, P = 2 \u00d7 (20m + 15m) = 2 \u00d7 35m = 70 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check the perimeter formula. The perimeter should be the total distance around the rectangle, so adding up all four sides.\n\nA rectangle has two sides of length and two sides of width, so it should be 2 times length plus 2 times width, which is the same as 2 times (length plus width). Yeah, that checks out.\n\nSo, P = 2 \u00d7 (20m + 15m) = 2 \u00d7 35m = 70 meters.\n\nAlright, so the area is 300 square meters and the perimeter is 70 meters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify these calculations again.\n\nFirst, area: 20m \u00d7 15m. 20 times 15 is indeed 300, and since we're multiplying meters by meters, it's square meters.\n\nNext, perimeter: 2 times (20m + 15m) is 2 times 35m, which is 70 meters.\n\nEverything seems correct. I don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. It's a straightforward problem involving basic geometry formulas.\n\nI remember in school, we used to do a lot of problems like this, and it's good to refresh my memory. Maybe I can even think about real-world applications of these calculations. For example, if someone wanted to fence their garden, they'd need to know the perimeter to figure out how much fencing to buy. And if they wanted to lay grass or something, they'd need to know the area to calculate how much turf or soil they need.\n\nAlso, I recall that for any rectangle, the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, but since the question doesn't ask for that, I don't need to go there.\n\nWait, but just out of curiosity, what would be the length of the diagonal of this garden?\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, diagonal (D) would be sqrt(L^2 + W^2).\n\nSo, D = sqrt(20^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(400 + 225) = sqrt(625) = 25 meters.\n\nThat's interesting, it's a 3-4-5 triangle scaled up: 15-20-25.\n\nBut again, since the question only asks for area and perimeter, I should stick to that.\n\nI think I've covered everything needed for this problem. The area is 300 square meters, and the perimeter is 70 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\(\\boxed{300}\\) square meters, and the perimeter is \\(\\boxed{70}\\) meters."
