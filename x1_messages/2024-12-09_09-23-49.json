        "content": "In the quiet hush of night's vast dome,\nWhere whispers of the cosmos roam,\nI find my muse in starlight's gleam,\nAs ancient as the world's early dream.\n\nBeneath the canopy of heaven's vault,\nI trace the paths where legends caught,\nThe fire of gods in every spark,\nThat paints the night with silken arc.\n\nOh, stars above, your silent song,\nIn constellations you belong,\nEach one a tale, a mythic lore,\nIn celestial script forevermore.\n\nLike frost upon the windowpane,\nYour light doth freeze in time's domain,\nA moment's peace in life's vast sea,\nWhere mortal cares can briefly be.\n\nYet in your steadfast glow, I see\nThe transient dance of destiny,\nFor though you shine with timeless grace,\nYou too, like us, are subject to space.\n\nSome fade to naught, some burn so bright,\nTheir stories lost in day's first light,\nBut in the dark, when all is still,\nTheir memory lingers, will o' the wisp.\n\nI wander through this world alone,\nWith only stars to call my own,\nTheir company in solitude,\nA friend in every hemisphere.\n\nSo here's to you, oh stars so high,\nWho guide the traveler's weary eye,\nIn darkness deep, you are the light,\nThe beacon of the endless night.\n\nAnd when my time on earth is through,\nAnd I have journeyed far and true,\nI pray that in some distant sky,\nMy spirit may among you lie.\n\nFor in the tapestry of night,\nYou are the threads that make it bright,\nAnd in your company, I find\nA peace that time cannot unwind.\n"
