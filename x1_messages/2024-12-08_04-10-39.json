        "content": "So John read 3 books last week, and each book had twice as many pages as the previous one. The first book had 50 pages. I need to find out how many pages he read in total.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The first book has 50 pages. Since each next book has twice as many pages as the previous one, the second book should have twice 50, which is 100 pages. Then, the third book would have twice the second book, so that's twice 100, which is 200 pages.\n\nNow, to find the total pages he read, I just need to add up the pages from all three books. So, 50 pages from the first book, plus 100 pages from the second book, plus 200 pages from the third book.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal pages = 50 + 100 + 200\n\nNow, adding those up:\n\n50 + 100 = 150\n\nThen, 150 + 200 = 350\n\nSo, John read a total of 350 pages last week.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this, maybe using a formula? Since each book has twice as many pages as the previous one, this seems like a geometric sequence.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 2.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\nS = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- a is the first term,\n\n- r is the common ratio,\n\n- n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- a = 50 (pages in the first book),\n\n- r = 2 (each book has twice as many pages as the previous one),\n\n- n = 3 (John read 3 books).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nS = 50 * (2^3 - 1) / (2 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 2^3:\n\n2^3 = 8\n\nThen, 8 - 1 = 7\n\nThe denominator is 2 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, S = 50 * 7 / 1 = 50 * 7 = 350\n\nThat matches the total I calculated earlier by adding them up directly.\n\nIt's good to see that both methods give the same result. So, John read a total of 350 pages last week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{350} \\]"
