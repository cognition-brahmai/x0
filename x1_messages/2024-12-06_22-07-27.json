        "content": "So there are 200 students in total, right? And half of them play soccer, which would be 100 students, since half of 200 is 100. Then, one-third of them play basketball. Let's see, one-third of 200 is approximately 66.67, but since we're dealing with people, it should be a whole number. Wait, 200 divided by 3 is actually 66.666..., so maybe it's 67 students play basketball. But that would make the total number of students playing soccer and basketball 100 + 67 = 167, and the rest play volleyball, which would be 200 - 167 = 33 students.\n\nBut wait, 200 divided by 3 isn't exactly 67; it's about 66.67. Maybe the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number. So, if we consider 67 students play basketball, then the total number of students playing soccer and basketball is 100 + 67 = 167, and 200 - 167 = 33 play volleyball.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of students playing basketball is exactly 66, since 3 times 66 is 198, which is less than 200, and then we'd have to see what to do with the remaining students.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me denote the number of students playing soccer as S, basketball as B, and volleyball as V. We know that S + B + V = 200.\n\nGiven that half of the students play soccer, so S = 200 / 2 = 100.\n\nOne-third play basketball, so B = 200 / 3 \u2248 66.67.\n\nBut since the number of students should be a whole number, perhaps the problem assumes that exactly 66 students play basketball.\n\nThen, V = 200 - S - B = 200 - 100 - 66 = 34 students.\n\nWait, but 100 + 66 = 166, and 200 - 166 = 34.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider B to be 67, then V = 200 - 100 - 67 = 33.\n\nBut 100 + 67 = 167, and 200 - 167 = 33.\n\nSo, depending on how we round the number of basketball players, we get either 33 or 34 students playing volleyball.\n\nThis seems a bit ambiguous. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that half play soccer and one-third play basketball, and the rest play volleyball, assuming no overlap between the sports.\n\nIn that case, the number of students playing volleyball would be V = 200 - S - B = 200 - 100 - (200 / 3).\n\nBut 200 / 3 is approximately 66.67, which we can't have a fraction of a student.\n\nMaybe the problem expects us to leave it as a fraction, but that doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of students is such that one-third is exact.\n\nBut 200 divided by 3 is not exact; it's approximately 66.67.\n\nThis is problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that half of the students play soccer, one-third of the remaining play basketball, and the rest play volleyball.\n\nLet's try that interpretation.\n\nFirst, half of 200 play soccer: S = 100.\n\nThen, one-third of the remaining play basketball. The remaining students after soccer is 200 - 100 = 100.\n\nOne-third of 100 is approximately 33.33, which again is not a whole number.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that one-third of all students play basketball, not one-third of the remaining.\n\nWait, the problem says \"one-third of them play basketball\", which likely means one-third of all students.\n\nSo, S = 100, B = 200 / 3 \u2248 66.67, and V = 200 - S - B.\n\nThis seems to be the correct interpretation, but the fractional student is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf we round 200 / 3 to 67, then V = 200 - 100 - 67 = 33.\n\nAlternatively, if we round down to 66, then V = 200 - 100 - 66 = 34.\n\nI think the standard rounding rules would suggest rounding 66.67 to 67.\n\nTherefore, B = 67, and V = 33.\n\nSo, 33 students play volleyball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{34} \\]"
