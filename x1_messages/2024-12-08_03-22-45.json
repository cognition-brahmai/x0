        "content": "Afternoon tea, also known as low tea or cream tea, originated in the United Kingdom during the 1840s. It was introduced by Anna Maria Russell, the 7th Duchess of Bedford, as a way to bridge the gap between lunch and dinner, which were often served early and late respectively. The Duchess began requesting a selection of tea, bread, and cake to be brought to her room during the afternoon, and soon, this tradition spread among the aristocracy and upper classes.\n\nAfternoon tea typically consists of a selection of sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and cakes or pastries, accompanied by a pot of tea. It is usually served around 4 pm and is often enjoyed in a relaxed and social setting. Today, afternoon tea is not only a popular tradition in the UK but has also gained popularity worldwide, with many hotels and restaurants offering their own versions of this delightful ritual."
