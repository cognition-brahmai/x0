        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag of marbles with different colors: 5 red, 8 blue, and 12 green. The question is, what's the probability of picking two red marbles in a row without putting the first one back. Okay, so without replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of marbles in the bag. Let's add them up: 5 red plus 8 blue plus 12 green gives us a total of 25 marbles.\n\nNow, probability of picking two red marbles in a row without replacement. That means the first marble I pick affects the second pick because I don't put it back.\n\nSo, the probability of the first marble being red is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles. That's 5 red out of 25 total, which simplifies to 1/5.\n\nNow, if I don't replace that first marble, there are now 24 marbles left in the bag, and only 4 of them are red.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a second red marble is 4 out of 24, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening consecutively, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, 1/5 times 1/6 is 1/30.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should think about it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red marbles out of 5 is \"5 choose 2\", which is (5*4)/2 = 10.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any 2 marbles out of 25 is \"25 choose 2\", which is (25*24)/2 = 300.\n\nSo, the probability is 10/300, which is also 1/30.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the probability is 1/30.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using probabilities directly without combinations.\n\nProbability of first marble being red: 5/25 = 1/5.\n\nGiven that the first marble was red, the probability of the second being red is 4/24 = 1/6.\n\nMultiplying them: 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30.\n\nSame answer again. So, I think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the order matters, the first pick is red (5/25), second pick is red (4/24), multiplied together gives 1/30.\n\nIf I consider order doesn't matter, using combinations, it's still 10/300 = 1/30.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same probability.\n\nI don't see any reason to doubt this answer. I've cross-verified it using different methods and getting consistent results.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking two red marbles consecutively without replacement is 1/30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{30}} \\]"
