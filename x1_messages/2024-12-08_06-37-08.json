        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a group of friends renting a vacation house that costs $1,500 in total. Initially, there were some people planning to go, but then 3 more decided to join at the last minute, making the total group size 12 people. We need to find out how much each person has to contribute now that there are 12 people sharing the cost equally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It seems like there was an initial group, and then 3 more people joined, making it 12 in total. The cost of $1,500 is to be split equally among these 12 people. So, I need to calculate the amount each person has to pay.\n\nTo do that, I think I should divide the total cost by the number of people. So, $1,500 divided by 12 people.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nCost per person = Total cost / Number of people\n\nCost per person = $1,500 / 12\n\nNow, I just need to do the division.\n\n1,500 divided by 12.\n\nLet's see, 12 times 12 is 144, which is less than 1,500. Wait, no, 12 times 100 is 1,200, and 12 times 12 is 144. Hmm, maybe I should use long division.\n\nOr, I could break it down: 12 times 100 is 1,200, and 1,500 minus 1,200 is 300. Then, 12 times 25 is 300. So, 100 plus 25 is 125.\n\nSo, $125 per person.\n\nWait, but I should check that.\n\n12 times 125 is 1,500.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, each person will have to contribute $125.\n\nBut, the question mentions that there were 3 more people joining at the last minute. Does that affect anything?\n\nWell, the question is about the final amount each person has to pay after the group size became 12. So, whether there were 3 more people joining or not, the final group size is 12, and the cost is split equally among them.\n\nSo, the calculation I did should be correct.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the question is trying to compare the original contribution per person with the new one after the 3 additional people joined.\n\nWait, the question specifically says: \"how much will each person now have to contribute?\" and it seems to be focusing on the final scenario where there are 12 people.\n\nSo, unless it's asking for the difference or something else, the answer should just be the cost per person in the final group size.\n\nTherefore, each person contributes $125.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the calculation again.\n\n12 times 125 is indeed 1,500.\n\nAlternatively, 12 times 100 is 1,200, plus 12 times 25 is 300, totaling 1,500.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is $125 per person.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
