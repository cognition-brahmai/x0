        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost per seat for different facilities in a new sports complex. The total budget is $500 million, and there are three main parts: a stadium, an indoor arena, and some outdoor fields. The stadium is going to hold 50,000 people, and the indoor arena can hold 20,000 spectators. The budget is divided up with 60% for the stadium, 30% for the indoor arena, and the remaining 10% for the outdoor fields.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to find out how much money is allocated to each facility. Let's start with the stadium. It's getting 60% of the total budget. So, I'll calculate 60% of $500 million.\n\nTo find 60% of $500 million, I can multiply 500 million by 0.60.\n\n500,000,000 * 0.60 = 300,000,000\n\nSo, the stadium's budget is $300 million.\n\nNext, the indoor arena is getting 30% of the total budget. So, I'll calculate 30% of $500 million.\n\n500,000,000 * 0.30 = 150,000,000\n\nTherefore, the indoor arena's budget is $150 million.\n\nNow, the outdoor fields are getting the remaining 10% of the budget.\n\n500,000,000 * 0.10 = 50,000,000\n\nSo, the outdoor fields have a budget of $50 million.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the cost per seat in each facility. So, I need to find out how much each seat costs in the stadium and the indoor arena.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the stadium. It has a seating capacity of 50,000 people and a budget of $300 million.\n\nTo find the cost per seat, I'll divide the total budget for the stadium by the number of seats.\n\n300,000,000 / 50,000 = 6,000\n\nSo, the cost per seat for the stadium is $6,000 per seat.\n\nNow, for the indoor arena, which has a seating capacity of 20,000 and a budget of $150 million.\n\nAgain, I'll divide the total budget by the number of seats.\n\n150,000,000 / 20,000 = 7,500\n\nTherefore, the cost per seat for the indoor arena is $7,500 per seat.\n\nHmm, interesting. The indoor arena seats cost more per seat than the stadium seats.\n\nWait a minute, the problem also mentions several outdoor fields, but it doesn't specify the number of seats for those. Since it's asking for the cost per seat in each facility, and the outdoor fields might not have seated areas, maybe we can assume that the cost per seat for the outdoor fields is not applicable or zero. But the problem doesn't specify any seats for the outdoor fields, so perhaps we can overlook that part for now, focusing on the stadium and the indoor arena.\n\nLet me double-check the question: \"Calculate the cost per seat in each facility if the stadium accounts for 60% of the total budget, the indoor arena takes up 30%, and the remaining 10% is allocated for the outdoor fields.\"\n\nIt says \"each facility,\" but it only gives seating capacities for the stadium and the indoor arena. Maybe the outdoor fields don't have seats, so their cost per seat wouldn't apply.\n\nAlternatively, if the outdoor fields do have seats, the problem doesn't specify how many seats they have. So, perhaps we can only calculate the cost per seat for the stadium and the indoor arena.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should ask if there are seats for the outdoor fields. Oh, wait, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's safe to assume that only the stadium and indoor arena have seated areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outdoor fields are intended for standing room only or don't have permanent seating. In that case, their cost per seat wouldn't apply.\n\nSo, I'll proceed under the assumption that only the stadium and indoor arena have seats, and calculate the cost per seat for those two facilities only.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Stadium: 50,000 seats, $300 million budget \u2192 $6,000 per seat\n\n- Indoor arena: 20,000 seats, $150 million budget \u2192 $7,500 per seat\n\n- Outdoor fields: $50 million budget, no specified seats \u2192 cost per seat not applicable\n\nTherefore, the cost per seat is $6,000 for the stadium and $7,500 for the indoor arena.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe cost per seat in the stadium is \\$6,000, and in the indoor arena, it is \\$7,500."
