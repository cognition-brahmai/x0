        "content": "So I've got this question here: The world consumes about 2 million bottles of soda every 3 minutes. I need to find out how many bottles are consumed worldwide in a week. And I have to provide a detailed explanation. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that there are 2 million bottles consumed every 3 minutes, and I need to find out the total consumption over a week. A week has 7 days, but I need to convert this into minutes because the consumption rate is given in minutes.\n\nLet me start by finding out how many minutes there are in a week.\n\nI know that:\n\n- 1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n- 1 hour = 60 minutes\n\n- 1 day = 24 hours\n\n- 1 week = 7 days\n\nSo, to find the total minutes in a week:\n\nMinutes in an hour: 60\n\nMinutes in a day: 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 minutes/day\n\nMinutes in a week: 1440 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 10,080 minutes/week\n\nSo, there are 10,080 minutes in a week.\n\nNow, the consumption rate is 2 million bottles every 3 minutes. I need to find out how many 3-minute intervals there are in a week.\n\nNumber of 3-minute intervals in a week: Total minutes in a week / 3 minutes = 10,080 / 3 = 3,360 intervals\n\nNow, if 2 million bottles are consumed in each 3-minute interval, then the total consumption in a week would be:\n\nTotal bottles = Number of intervals * bottles per interval = 3,360 * 2,000,000\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a really big number. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, minutes in a week:\n\n60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 7 days/week = 10,080 minutes/week\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, number of 3-minute intervals in a week:\n\n10,080 minutes / 3 minutes = 3,360 intervals\n\nThat seems right.\n\nNow, consumption per interval is 2,000,000 bottles.\n\nSo, total consumption is 3,360 * 2,000,000\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n3,360 * 2,000,000 = 3,360 * 2,000,000 = 6,720,000,000 bottles\n\nThat's 6.72 billion bottles per week.\n\nWait, but is there a better way to handle the units to make sure I'm not missing something?\n\nLet me try using rates.\n\nConsumption rate: 2,000,000 bottles every 3 minutes.\n\nFirst, find the consumption rate per minute:\n\n2,000,000 bottles / 3 minutes = approximately 666,666.67 bottles per minute\n\nNow, total minutes in a week: 10,080\n\nSo, total bottles in a week: 666,666.67 bottles/minute * 10,080 minutes = 6,720,000,000 bottles\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the consumption per day and then multiply by 7.\n\nFirst, find minutes in a day: 1,440\n\nNumber of 3-minute intervals in a day: 1,440 / 3 = 480 intervals\n\nBottles per day: 480 intervals * 2,000,000 = 960,000,000 bottles per day\n\nThen, for 7 days: 960,000,000 * 7 = 6,720,000,000 bottles per week\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nAlternatively, I can use dimensional analysis to ensure units are handled correctly.\n\nStarting with the consumption rate: 2,000,000 bottles every 3 minutes, which is 2,000,000 bottles / 3 minutes\n\nNow, to find the total bottles in a week:\n\n(2,000,000 bottles / 3 minutes) * 10,080 minutes = (2,000,000 / 3) * 10,080 bottles\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 2,000,000 / 3 = approximately 666,666.67 bottles per minute\n\nThen, 666,666.67 * 10,080 = 6,720,000,000 bottles\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep it in fractions to avoid decimals.\n\n2,000,000 bottles / 3 minutes * 10,080 minutes = (2,000,000 * 10,080) / 3 bottles\n\nFirst, 2,000,000 * 10,080 = 20,160,000,000\n\nThen, divided by 3: 20,160,000,000 / 3 = 6,720,000,000 bottles\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear now that the total consumption is 6,720,000,000 bottles per week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs the consumption rate constant throughout the week? The question says \"the world consumes about 2 million bottles every 3 minutes,\" so it seems like a constant rate is assumed.\n\nAre there any leap years or extra minutes to consider? No, because we're dealing with a standard week of 7 days.\n\nIs there any regional variation or downtime? The question doesn't specify, so I'll assume the consumption is constant worldwide without any breaks.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the annual consumption, but since the question is only about a week, I don't need to go there.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to, I could find the hourly consumption and then multiply by hours in a week, but that's unnecessary since the methods above already confirm the answer.\n\nLet me try that anyway for verification.\n\nMinutes in an hour: 60\n\nNumber of 3-minute intervals in an hour: 60 / 3 = 20 intervals\n\nBottles per hour: 20 * 2,000,000 = 40,000,000 bottles per hour\n\nHours in a week: 24 * 7 = 168 hours\n\nTotal bottles per week: 40,000,000 * 168 = 6,720,000,000 bottles\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 6,720,000,000 bottles consumed worldwide in a week.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the precision of the given data.\n\nThe question says \"about 2 million bottles every 3 minutes.\" So, it's an approximation. Therefore, giving the answer in billions is appropriate, as more decimal places wouldn't make sense given the input precision.\n\nAlso, considering that \"about 2 million\" could imply a range, but since no specific precision is required, 6,720,000,000 is acceptable.\n\nAnother angle: if the consumption rate varies, but the question assumes a constant rate, so I don't need to account for variations.\n\nAlternatively, if consumption is higher during certain times, but again, the question provides a average rate.\n\nSo, I think 6,720,000,000 bottles per week is the correct and final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6720000000} \\]"
