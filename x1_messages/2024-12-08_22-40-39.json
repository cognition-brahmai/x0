        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, there are 300 people. According to the problem, 1/3 of them have dogs. So, first, I need to find out how many people have dogs.\n\nTo do that, I'll take 1/3 of 300:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people with dogs} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 300 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, 100 people have dogs.\n\nNow, out of these dog owners, 2/5 also have cats. I need to find out how many people that is.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people with both dogs and cats} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 40 people have both dogs and cats.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I might be missing something. The problem says that 2/5 of those with dogs also have cats. So, yes, that means out of the 100 dog owners, 2/5 of them have cats too.\n\nLet me calculate it again to be sure.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of fractions of the total population.\n\nFirst, find the fraction of people who have both dogs and cats.\n\nWe know that 1/3 of the people have dogs, and 2/5 of those have cats as well.\n\nSo, the fraction that has both dogs and cats is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\nNow, apply this fraction to the total population:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{15} \\times 300 = 40\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 40 people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can visualize this with a diagram or a table.\n\nLet's say the total population is 300.\n\n- People with dogs: 1/3 of 300 = 100\n\n- People with both dogs and cats: 2/5 of 100 = 40\n\nSo, the number of people who have both dogs and cats is 40.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap with other pet owners or anything like that. The problem only mentions dogs and cats, and specifically says that 2/5 of those who have dogs also have cats. So, it's straightforward.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider people who only have cats or people who have neither dogs nor cats, because the question is only asking for the number of people who have both dogs and cats.\n\nSo, my final answer is 40 people have both dogs and cats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
