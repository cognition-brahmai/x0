        "content": "So the company currently produces 2,000 widgets per day, and each widget brings in $15 in revenue. If they increase production by 10%, I need to find out how much more revenue that would generate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 10% of the current production is. So, 10% of 2,000 widgets is:\n\n2,000 * 0.10 = 200 widgets\n\nSo, if they increase production by 10%, they'll be producing an additional 200 widgets per day.\n\nNow, since each widget generates $15 in revenue, the additional revenue from these 200 widgets would be:\n\n200 * $15 = $3,000\n\nTherefore, the company would generate an additional $3,000 in revenue per day by increasing production by 10%.\n\nBut wait, maybe they want to know the total revenue after the increase, not just the additional revenue. The question says \"additional revenue,\" so I think $3,000 is the answer they're looking for.\n\nStill, it might be useful to calculate the total revenue before and after the increase to see the difference.\n\nOriginally, with 2,000 widgets at $15 each, the daily revenue is:\n\n2,000 * $15 = $30,000\n\nAfter the increase, they're producing 2,000 + 200 = 2,200 widgets.\n\nSo, the new daily revenue would be:\n\n2,200 * $15 = $33,000\n\nIndeed, the additional revenue is $33,000 - $30,000 = $3,000, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any costs associated with producing the additional widgets, but the question only asks for additional revenue, not profit. So, I don't need to factor in costs; just focus on the revenue.\n\nAlso, assume that they can sell all the additional widgets produced, which seems reasonable given the information provided.\n\nSo, the final answer is an additional $3,000 in daily revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]"
