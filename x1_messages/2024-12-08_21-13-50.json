        "content": "So I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a company with 500 employees, and management decides to give each employee a 10% salary increase and also hire an additional 50 employees. I need to find out what the total percentage increase in the company's payroll is.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what payroll is. Payroll is the total amount of money a company spends on salaries for its employees in a given period, right? So, if the company has 500 employees and each gets a 10% raise, and then they hire 50 more employees, I need to calculate how much the total payroll increases and then find out what percentage that increase is relative to the original payroll.\n\nLet me try to break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the original payroll.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each employee has an average salary of S. So, the original payroll would be 500 * S.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the new salaries after the 10% increase.\n\nEach of the original 500 employees gets a 10% raise, so their new salary would be S + 0.1S = 1.1S.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the payroll for the original employees after the raise.\n\nThat would be 500 * 1.1S = 550S.\n\nStep 4: Account for the new hires.\n\nThe company hires an additional 50 employees. Assuming they also earn an average salary of S, the total payroll for these new employees would be 50 * S = 50S.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total new payroll.\n\nThis would be the payroll for the original employees after the raise plus the payroll for the new employees: 550S + 50S = 600S.\n\nStep 6: Find the increase in payroll.\n\nThe increase is the new payroll minus the original payroll: 600S - 500S = 100S.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the percentage increase.\n\nThe percentage increase is (increase / original payroll) * 100% = (100S / 500S) * 100% = 20%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I feel like I might be missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nIs it correct to assume that the new employees also earn an average salary of S? Maybe the problem implies that the new employees earn a different salary. But since it doesn't specify, I think it's reasonable to assume that they earn the same average salary as the existing employees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company gives the 10% raise to all employees, including the new ones, but since the new ones are just being hired, their base salary before the raise would be S, and then they get a 10% raise to 1.1S.\n\nWait, but in that case, the new employees would be earning 1.1S, not S.\n\nLet me adjust my steps accordingly.\n\n Revised Step 4: Account for the new hires with the 10% raise.\n\nThe new employees are hired and immediately given a 10% raise on their base salary. If their base salary is S, then their salary after the raise would be 1.1S.\n\nTherefore, the payroll for the new employees would be 50 * 1.1S = 55S.\n\n Revised Step 5: Calculate the total new payroll.\n\nNow, the total new payroll would be the payroll for the original employees after the raise plus the payroll for the new employees: 550S + 55S = 605S.\n\n Revised Step 6: Find the increase in payroll.\n\nThe increase is 605S - 500S = 105S.\n\n Revised Step 7: Calculate the percentage increase.\n\nPercentage increase = (105S / 500S) * 100% = 21%.\n\nHmm, now I get 21% instead of 20%. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the second approach is more accurate because the new employees also receive a 10% raise on their base salary.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the 10% raise only applies to the existing employees, and the new employees are hired at their base salary without a raise.\n\nThe problem says, \"give each employee a 10% salary increase and hire an additional 50 employees.\"\n\nThis phrasing could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. The 10% raise is given to all employees, including the new ones.\n\n2. The 10% raise is only given to the existing employees, and the new employees are hired at their base salary.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is that the 10% raise is given to the existing employees only, and the new employees are hired at their base salary.\n\nLet me adjust my steps based on this interpretation.\n\n Alternative Step 2: Only the original 500 employees get a 10% raise.\n\nSo, their new salary is 1.1S.\n\nStep 3: Payroll for original employees after raise: 500 * 1.1S = 550S.\n\nStep 4: Payroll for new employees: 50 * S = 50S.\n\nStep 5: Total new payroll: 550S + 50S = 600S.\n\nStep 6: Increase in payroll: 600S - 500S = 100S.\n\nStep 7: Percentage increase: (100S / 500S) * 100% = 20%.\n\nThis seems consistent with my first approach.\n\nBut in the second approach, I assumed that new employees also get a 10% raise, which led to a 21% increase.\n\nGiven the wording, I think the first approach is correct: the 10% raise is for each employee, which in this context likely means the existing employees, and the new employees are hired at their base salary.\n\nTherefore, the total percentage increase in the company's payroll is 20%.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the total number of employees after the hires: 500 + 50 = 550 employees.\n\nIf the original payroll was 500S, and the new payroll is 550S, that would be a 10% increase, but that doesn't account for the 10% raise for the existing employees.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Original average salary: S\n\n- Number of original employees: 500\n\n- Number of new employees: 50\n\nFirst scenario:\n\n- Existing employees get a 10% raise: their new salary is 1.1S\n\n- New employees are hired at the original salary S\n\nTotal new payroll: (500 * 1.1S) + (50 * S) = 550S + 50S = 600S\n\nOriginal payroll: 500S\n\nIncrease: 600S - 500S = 100S\n\nPercentage increase: (100S / 500S) * 100% = 20%\n\nSecond scenario:\n\n- Existing employees get a 10% raise: 1.1S\n\n- New employees are hired at a 10% raise: S + 0.1S = 1.1S\n\nTotal new payroll: (500 * 1.1S) + (50 * 1.1S) = 550S + 55S = 605S\n\nOriginal payroll: 500S\n\nIncrease: 605S - 500S = 105S\n\nPercentage increase: (105S / 500S) * 100% = 21%\n\nGiven that, I need to determine which scenario is correct based on the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"give each employee a 10% salary increase and hire an additional 50 employees.\"\n\nThe phrase \"each employee\" could be interpreted as:\n\n1. Only the existing employees get a 10% raise, and new employees are hired at their base salary.\n\n2. All employees, including new hires, get a 10% raise.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more accurate because \"each employee\" likely refers to the employees who are already with the company, and new hires would start at their base salary.\n\nTherefore, the total percentage increase in the company's payroll is 20%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new employees are also given a 10% raise as part of the same policy. In that case, the increase would be 21%.\n\nTo be thorough, I should consider both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: Only existing employees get a raise.\n\nTotal new payroll: 550S + 50S = 600S\n\nIncrease: 100S\n\nPercentage increase: 20%\n\nOption 2: Both existing and new employees get a raise.\n\nTotal new payroll: 550S + 55S = 605S\n\nIncrease: 105S\n\nPercentage increase: 21%\n\nSince the problem is ambiguous on whether new employees also receive a raise, both answers could be possible.\n\nHowever, given the wording \"give each employee a 10% salary increase and hire an additional 50 employees,\" it seems more plausible that \"each employee\" refers to the current employees, and new hires are handled separately.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is a 20% increase in the company's payroll.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the total number of employees after the hire: 550.\n\nIf all employees are now getting a 10% raise, then the total payroll would be 550 * 1.1S = 605S.\n\nOriginal payroll: 500S\n\nIncrease: 605S - 500S = 105S\n\nPercentage increase: 21%.\n\nBut this assumes that all employees, including new ones, are getting a 10% raise.\n\nAlternatively, if only existing employees get a raise, then it's 500 * 1.1S + 50 * S = 600S, which is a 20% increase.\n\nI think the problem is open to interpretation, but I'll go with the 20% increase as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
