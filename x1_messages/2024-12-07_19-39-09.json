        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Node.js script that listens for HTTP requests and logs details about each request to a text file. I need to make sure it can take command-line arguments for the port and the log file path. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic HTTP server in Node.js. I know that Node has the built-in 'http' module for this purpose. So, I'll start by requiring the 'http' module.\n\nNext, I need to handle command-line arguments. Node provides the 'process.argv' array for this. I should parse this array to get the port and log file path provided by the user.\n\nOnce I have the port, I can make the server listen on that port. For each incoming request, I need to log the request method, URL, headers, and body to the specified log file.\n\nLogging to a file in Node.js can be done using the 'fs' module, specifically the 'appendFile' method to add entries to the log file without overwriting existing content.\n\nI also need to handle the request body since it's not directly accessible in the request object by default. I think I'll need to use the 'request' event and read the data from the request stream.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n1. Require necessary modules: http, fs, process.\n\n2. Parse command-line arguments for port and log file path.\n\n3. Set up an HTTP server that listens on the specified port.\n\n4. For each incoming request:\n\na. Read and log the request method, URL, and headers.\n\nb. Read the request body and log it.\n\n5. Append all this information to the specified log file.\n\nI should also make sure that the log entries are nicely formatted and separated for clarity.\n\nLet me think about potential issues:\n\n- If no port is specified, the script should use a default port, maybe 3000.\n\n- Similarly, if no log file path is provided, maybe use a default name like 'http.log'.\n\n- Need to handle cases where the log file cannot be written to due to permission issues.\n\n- Ensure that the request body is fully read, especially for larger payloads.\n\nI recall that request bodies can be of varying sizes and types, so I might need to handle different content-types, but for simplicity, I'll assume plain text or JSON bodies.\n\nAlso, I should consider making the logging asynchronous to avoid blocking the event loop.\n\nAlright, let's start writing some code.\n\nFirst, require the necessary modules:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst http = require('http');\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nconst process = require('process');\n\n```\n\nNext, parse the command-line arguments. The 'process.argv' array contains the node executable path, script path, and then the arguments. So, process.argv[2] should be the port, and process.argv[3] should be the log file path.\n\nI'll assign default values in case they are not provided.\n\n```javascript\n\nconst PORT = process.argv[2] || 3000;\n\nconst LOG_FILE = process.argv[3] || 'http.log';\n\nconsole.log(`Listening on port ${PORT} and logging to ${LOG_FILE}`);\n\n```\n\nNow, set up the HTTP server:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n\n// Handle each request here\n\n});\n\n```\n\nInside the request handler, I need to log the method, URL, headers, and body.\n\nFirst, log the method and URL:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst { method, url } = req;\n\n```\n\nThen, get the headers:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst headers = JSON.stringify(req.headers);\n\n```\n\nFor the body, I need to read the request data. I can listen for 'data' events on the request stream and collect the chunks.\n\n```javascript\n\nlet body = '';\n\nreq.on('data', chunk => {\n\nbody += chunk;\n\n});\n\nreq.on('end', () => {\n\n// All data received, log everything\n\nconst logEntry = `${method} ${url}\\nHeaders: ${headers}\\nBody: ${body}\\n---\\n`;\n\nappendLog(logEntry);\n\nres.end('Logged');\n\n});\n\n```\n\nI need to define the 'appendLog' function, which will write the log entry to the file asynchronously.\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction appendLog(entry) {\n\nfs.appendFile(LOG_FILE, entry, err => {\n\nif (err) {\n\nconsole.error(`Error writing to log file: ${err}`);\n\n}\n\n});\n\n}\n\n```\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst http = require('http');\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nconst process = require('process');\n\nconst PORT = process.argv[2] || 3000;\n\nconst LOG_FILE = process.argv[3] || 'http.log';\n\nconsole.log(`Listening on port ${PORT} and logging to ${LOG_FILE}`);\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n\nconst { method, url } = req;\n\nconst headers = JSON.stringify(req.headers);\n\nlet body = '';\n\nreq.on('data', chunk => {\n\nbody += chunk;\n\n});\n\nreq.on('end', () => {\n\nconst logEntry = `${method} ${url}\\nHeaders: ${headers}\\nBody: ${body}\\n---\\n`;\n\nappendLog(logEntry);\n\nres.end('Logged');\n\n});\n\n});\n\nfunction appendLog(entry) {\n\nfs.appendFile(LOG_FILE, entry, err => {\n\nif (err) {\n\nconsole.error(`Error writing to log file: ${err}`);\n\n}\n\n});\n\n}\n\nserver.listen(PORT, () => {\n\nconsole.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);\n\n});\n\n```\n\nI should test this script to make sure it works as expected. I'll save this code to a file, say 'logServer.js', and run it from the command line with node.\n\nFirst, without specifying port and log file:\n\n```\n\nnode logServer.js\n\n```\n\nIt should listen on port 3000 and log to 'http.log'.\n\nThen, make some HTTP requests using curl or Postman to verify that the logs are being written correctly.\n\nNext, specify a different port and log file:\n\n```\n\nnode logServer.js 8080 requests.log\n\n```\n\nCheck if it listens on port 8080 and logs to 'requests.log'.\n\nI should also check for edge cases, like large request bodies, various content-types, and invalid input.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to add some error handling, like catching server setup errors or log write failures.\n\nOverall, this seems straightforward. I need to ensure that all parts work together seamlessly.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a Node.js script that listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port and logs the request method, URL, headers, and body to a text file, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Set up the HTTP server:** Use Node.js's built-in `http` module to create an HTTP server.\n2. **Parse command-line arguments:** Use `process.argv` to get the port and log file path from command-line arguments.\n3. **Log request details:** For each incoming request, capture the method, URL, headers, and body, then append these details to a specified log file using the `fs` module.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst process = require('process');\n\n// Default port and log file if not provided\nconst PORT = process.argv[2] || 3000;\nconst LOG_FILE = process.argv[3] || 'http.log';\n\nconsole.log(`Listening on port ${PORT} and logging to ${LOG_FILE}`);\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n    const { method, url } = req;\n    const headers = JSON.stringify(req.headers);\n\n    let body = '';\n    req.on('data', chunk => {\n        body += chunk;\n    });\n    req.on('end', () => {\n        const logEntry = `${method} ${url}\\nHeaders: ${headers}\\nBody: ${body}\\n---\\n`;\n        appendLog(logEntry);\n        res.end('Logged');\n    });\n});\n\nfunction appendLog(entry) {\n    fs.appendFile(LOG_FILE, entry, err => {\n        if (err) {\n            console.error(`Error writing to log file: ${err}`);\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nserver.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **HTTP Server Setup:** \n   - The `http.createServer()` function is used to create an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests.\n   \n2. **Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - `process.argv` is used to retrieve command-line arguments. The port and log file path are expected as the first and second arguments respectively.\n   - Defaults are provided for the port (3000) and log file ('http.log') if not specified.\n\n3. **Request Handling:**\n   - For each request, the method and URL are extracted from the request object.\n   - Headers are stringified for logging.\n   - The request body is collected by listening to 'data' events and appended to a string.\n\n4. **Logging:**\n   - Once the entire request body is received ('end' event), a log entry is formatted and appended to the specified log file using `fs.appendFile()`, which ensures that logs are added without overwriting existing content.\n\n5. **Server Execution:**\n   - The server starts listening on the specified port, and a message is logged to confirm this.\n\nThis script provides a simple way to log HTTP request details for monitoring or debugging purposes."
