        "content": "Realism in political science is indeed known for its focus on the competitive and conflictual aspects of international relations. It's a perspective that has been influential in understanding state behavior and the dynamics of the international system. Now, to answer your question about which concept isn't associated with realism, let's first recap what realism entails.\n\nRealism posits that the international system is anarchic, meaning there's no overarching authority above states to enforce rules or resolve disputes. In this environment, states are primarily concerned with their own survival and security. Realists believe that power is the currency of international relations, and states engage in a struggle for power to ensure their own security and advance their national interests.\n\nGiven this backdrop, let's look at the options you've provided:\n\nA. Balance of power - This is a fundamental concept in realism. The idea is that states try to prevent any one state from becoming too powerful, as that could threaten their own security. They do this by forming alliances and adjusting their policies to maintain a balance that deters potential aggressors.\n\nB. National interest - Realism places a strong emphasis on national interest. States are seen as rational actors pursuing their own self-interest, defined primarily in terms of power and security.\n\nC. International cooperation - This is where things get a bit tricky. Realists don't deny that cooperation can occur in international relations; however, they view it skeptically. From a realist perspective, cooperation is often seen as a way for states to manage their competing interests or to achieve their national goals more effectively. It's not that realists entirely reject cooperation, but they see it as secondary to competition and conflict.\n\nD. Security dilemma - This is another key concept in realism. The security dilemma occurs when one state takes actions to enhance its own security, but those actions make other states feel less secure, prompting them to take countermeasures that in turn make the first state feel less secure. This can lead to an arms race or other escalatory behaviors, even if neither side intends to initiate conflict.\n\nNow, considering these explanations, the concept that is least associated with realism is probably international cooperation. While realists acknowledge that states can cooperate, they see such cooperation as being driven by self-interest and as potentially unstable because of underlying power struggles.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that realism is not monolithic, and different realist thinkers may have varying degrees of acceptance for international cooperation. Some neorealists, for example, might be more open to the idea that institutions can facilitate cooperation, albeit within the constraints imposed by the international system's anarchic nature.\n\nMoreover, other schools of thought in international relations, such as liberalism and constructivism, place a greater emphasis on international cooperation and the role of norms, institutions, and shared values in shaping state behavior.\n\nIn summary, while realists don't entirely dismiss international cooperation, it's not central to their theory, which focuses more on competition, conflict, and the pursuit of national interest in an anarchic international system. Therefore, among the options provided, international cooperation is the concept least associated with realism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
