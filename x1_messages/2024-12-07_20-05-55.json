        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence where each term is the sum of the three previous terms. The first three terms are given as 1, 2, and 4. I need to find the tenth term. Okay, let's start by writing down what I know.\n\nSo, the sequence is defined such that:\n\n- Term 1 (a1) = 1\n\n- Term 2 (a2) = 2\n\n- Term 3 (a3) = 4\n\nAnd for any term n > 3, an = a(n-1) + a(n-2) + a(n-3)\n\nMy goal is to find the tenth term, which is a10.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the terms leading up to the tenth term step by step.\n\nLet's calculate term 4:\n\na4 = a3 + a2 + a1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\nNow, term 5:\n\na5 = a4 + a3 + a2 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13\n\nTerm 6:\n\na6 = a5 + a4 + a3 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24\n\nTerm 7:\n\na7 = a6 + a5 + a4 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44\n\nTerm 8:\n\na8 = a7 + a6 + a5 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81\n\nTerm 9:\n\na9 = a8 + a7 + a6 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149\n\nFinally, term 10:\n\na10 = a9 + a8 + a7 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274\n\nSo, the tenth term in the sequence is 274.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\na1 = 1\n\na2 = 2\n\na3 = 4\n\na4 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \u221a\n\na5 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13 \u221a\n\na6 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24 \u221a\n\na7 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44 \u221a\n\na8 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81 \u221a\n\na9 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149 \u221a\n\na10 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274 \u221a\n\nLooks correct. Alternatively, I could try to find a general formula for the nth term, but since the sequence is defined recursively and I only need the tenth term, calculating step by step is efficient enough.\n\nAnother way to approach this could be to look for a pattern or a generating function, but given the time constraints, the step-by-step addition seems straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nI can also verify this by writing out the sequence:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149, 274\n\nEach term is indeed the sum of the three preceding terms.\n\nTherefore, the tenth term is 274.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{274} \\]"
