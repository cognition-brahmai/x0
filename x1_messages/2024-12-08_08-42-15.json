        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're looking for three consecutive odd integers that add up to 75. First off, I need to remember what consecutive odd integers are. Consecutive odd integers are odd numbers that come one after the other without any even numbers in between. For example, 1, 3, 5 or 11, 13, 15, things like that.\n\nNow, how can I represent three consecutive odd integers mathematically? I think I can let the first integer be a variable, say x. Since odd numbers are two units apart, the next odd integer would be x + 2, and the one after that would be x + 4. So, my three consecutive odd integers are x, x + 2, and x + 4.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of these integers and set it equal to 75. So, x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 75. Let me simplify that. Combining like terms, x + x + x is 3x, and 2 + 4 is 6. So, 3x + 6 = 75.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. First, I'll subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to isolate the terms with x. So, 3x + 6 - 6 = 75 - 6, which simplifies to 3x = 69.\n\nThen, I'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for x. So, x = 69 / 3, which is x = 23.\n\nNow that I have x, which is the first integer, I can find the other two. The second integer is x + 2 = 23 + 2 = 25, and the third is x + 4 = 23 + 4 = 27.\n\nSo, the three consecutive odd integers are 23, 25, and 27.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure this is correct. Adding them up: 23 + 25 + 27. 23 + 25 is 48, plus 27 is 75. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe starting from the middle number. Since there are three numbers, the middle one should be the average of the three. The sum is 75, so the average is 75 divided by 3, which is 25. So, if 25 is the middle number, then the numbers before and after it, which are also odd, would be 23 and 27. That matches what I found earlier.\n\nAnother way could be to use the fact that the difference between the integers is 2, being consecutive odd numbers. So, if I let the numbers be x - 2, x, and x + 2, their sum would be (x - 2) + x + (x + 2) = 3x = 75. So, x = 25. Then, the numbers are 23, 25, and 27. Again, the same result.\n\nI think this is solid. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other possible set of three consecutive odd integers that add up to 75. If I try another starting point, say x = 21, then the next two would be 23 and 25, and their sum is 21 + 23 + 25 = 69, which is less than 75. If I go higher, x = 25, then 25 + 27 + 29 = 81, which is more than 75. So, only x = 23 gives the sum of 75.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that these are indeed odd integers. 23, 25, and 27 are all odd numbers, so that checks out.\n\nOne more thing to consider: is there a general formula for this kind of problem? Yes, for any sum of consecutive odd integers, you can use a similar approach. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking for n consecutive odd integers that sum to s. The first integer can be represented as x, the next as x + 2, and so on, up to x + 2(n-1). The sum would be n*x + 2*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = n*x + 2*(n(n-1)/2) = n*x + n(n-1) = n*(x + n - 1). Set this equal to s and solve for x.\n\nIn this case, n = 3, so 3*(x + 2) = 75, which simplifies to x + 2 = 25, so x = 23. Again, the same answer.\n\nI think I\u2019ve covered all the bases here. The three consecutive odd integers that sum to 75 are 23, 25, and 27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23, 25, 27} \\]"
