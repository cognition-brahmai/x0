The cost of constructing the soccer field is $2 million, while each basketball court costs $500,000. The swimming pool has an estimated construction cost of $4 million. Calculate how many basketball courts can be built within the budget, considering additional expenses such as landscaping, parking lots, and lighting, which are expected to consume 20% of the total budget. Provide step-by-step reasoning."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city is planning to build a sports complex with a soccer field, basketball courts, and a swimming pool, and the total budget is $10 million. We need to figure out how many basketball courts can be built, considering some additional expenses.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the known costs:\n\n- Soccer field: $2 million\n\n- Swimming pool: $4 million\n\n- Each basketball court: $500,000\n\n- Additional expenses (landscaping, parking lots, lighting): 20% of the total budget\n\nThe total budget is $10 million, and additional expenses are expected to consume 20% of that. So, let's calculate how much money is allocated to these additional expenses.\n\nAdditional expenses = 20% of $10 million = 0.20 * 10,000,000 = $2 million\n\nNow, let's see how much money is left for the actual sports facilities after accounting for these additional expenses.\n\nMoney left for facilities = Total budget - Additional expenses = $10 million - $2 million = $8 million\n\nOkay, so we have $8 million to spend on the soccer field, swimming pool, and basketball courts.\n\nNext, let's subtract the costs of the soccer field and the swimming pool from this $8 million.\n\nCost of soccer field + Cost of swimming pool = $2 million + $4 million = $6 million\n\nMoney left for basketball courts = $8 million - $6 million = $2 million\n\nNow, each basketball court costs $500,000, so to find out how many courts can be built with the remaining $2 million, we divide the remaining money by the cost per court.\n\nNumber of courts = $2 million / $500,000 per court = 4 courts\n\nSo, at first glance, it seems like they can build 4 basketball courts within the budget.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure we haven't missed anything.\n\nFirst, confirm the additional expenses are indeed 20% of the total budget, which is $2 million. That seems correct.\n\nThen, the money left for facilities is $8 million, which is also correct.\n\nThe soccer field and swimming pool together cost $6 million, leaving $2 million for basketball courts.\n\nEach court costs $500,000, so $2 million divided by $500,000 per court equals 4 courts.\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly.\n\nI think the answer is 4 basketball courts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
