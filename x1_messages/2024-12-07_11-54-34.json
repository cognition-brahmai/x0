        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and we're told that its length is twice its width. Also, the perimeter of the garden is 60 meters. We need to find the area of the garden.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic formulas for rectangles. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times \\text{length} + 2 \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nAnd the area (A) is:\n\n\\[ A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nGiven that the length (L) is twice the width (W), we can express it as:\n\n\\[ L = 2W \\]\n\nNow, plugging this into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ 60 = 2 \\times (2W) + 2 \\times W \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 60 = 4W + 2W \\]\n\\[ 60 = 6W \\]\n\nSo, solving for W:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow, since L = 2W:\n\n\\[ L = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nFinally, the area A is:\n\n\\[ A = L \\times W = 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Perimeter is indeed 2 times length plus 2 times width. And here, length is twice the width. So, if width is 10 meters, length is 20 meters. Perimeter would be 2 times 20 plus 2 times 10, which is 40 plus 20, equals 60 meters. That checks out.\n\nArea is length times width, so 20 times 10 is indeed 200 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for perimeter and substituted L with 2W directly:\n\n\\[ P = 2L + 2W \\]\n\\[ 60 = 2(2W) + 2W \\]\n\\[ 60 = 4W + 2W \\]\n\\[ 60 = 6W \\]\n\\[ W = 10 \\]\n\nThen, L = 2W = 20, and A = L \u00d7 W = 200.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for a rectangle with a given perimeter, the area is maximized when the rectangle is a square. But in this case, since length is twice the width, it's not a square. So, the area should be less than what it would be for a square with the same perimeter.\n\nFor example, if it were a square, each side would be 15 meters (since perimeter is 60, divided by 4), and area would be 225 square meters. But here, the area is 200 square meters, which is less than 225, as expected.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use equations, I could set up the system:\n\n\\[ L = 2W \\]\n\\[ 2L + 2W = 60 \\]\n\nSubstitute L from the first equation into the second:\n\n\\[ 2(2W) + 2W = 60 \\]\n\\[ 4W + 2W = 60 \\]\n\\[ 6W = 60 \\]\n\\[ W = 10 \\]\n\nThen, L = 20, and A = 200.\n\nAlternatively, I could express everything in terms of width:\n\nPerimeter: 2L + 2W = 60\n\nBut L = 2W, so:\n\n2(2W) + 2W = 60\n\n4W + 2W = 60\n\n6W = 60\n\nW = 10\n\nThen, L = 20, A = 200.\n\nOr, express in terms of length:\n\nSince L = 2W, then W = L/2\n\nPerimeter: 2L + 2(W) = 2L + 2(L/2) = 2L + L = 3L = 60\n\nThen, L = 20\n\nThen, W = 10, A = 200.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI could also consider using the formula for the perimeter to solve for one variable and then substitute into the area formula.\n\nFor instance, from the perimeter formula:\n\n2L + 2W = 60\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nL + W = 30\n\nThen, since L = 2W:\n\n2W + W = 30\n\n3W = 30\n\nW = 10\n\nThen, L = 20, A = 200.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't know the relationship between length and width, I could have two variables and two equations:\n\nEquation 1: L = 2W\n\nEquation 2: 2L + 2W = 60\n\nSubstitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n\n2(2W) + 2W = 60\n\n4W + 2W = 60\n\n6W = 60\n\nW = 10\n\nThen, L = 20, A = 200.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't substitute, I could solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution methods.\n\nFor example, from Equation 2:\n\n2L + 2W = 60\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nL + W = 30\n\nNow, from Equation 1: L = 2W\n\nSubstitute into the above:\n\n2W + W = 30\n\n3W = 30\n\nW = 10\n\nThen, L = 20, A = 200.\n\nAlternatively, using elimination:\n\nFrom Equation 1: L - 2W = 0\n\nFrom Equation 2: 2L + 2W = 60\n\nMultiply Equation 1 by 2: 2L - 4W = 0\n\nNow, subtract this from Equation 2:\n\n(2L + 2W) - (2L - 4W) = 60 - 0\n\n2L + 2W - 2L + 4W = 60\n\n6W = 60\n\nW = 10\n\nThen, L = 20, A = 200.\n\nAs you can see, no matter which method I use, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI could also check if there's a way to find the area directly without finding L and W individually.\n\nFor example, since L = 2W, and P = 2L + 2W = 60,\n\nThen, P = 2(2W) + 2W = 6W = 60, so W = 10, L = 20, A = 200.\n\nAlternatively, express area in terms of W:\n\nA = L \u00d7 W = 2W \u00d7 W = 2W\u00b2\n\nFrom perimeter: 2L + 2W = 60, with L = 2W,\n\nSo, 2(2W) + 2W = 60 \u2192 4W + 2W = 60 \u2192 6W = 60 \u2192 W = 10\n\nThen, A = 2(10)\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 100 = 200.\n\nBut that's essentially the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, express area in terms of L:\n\nSince L = 2W, then W = L/2\n\nA = L \u00d7 (L/2) = L\u00b2 / 2\n\nFrom perimeter: 2L + 2(W) = 2L + 2(L/2) = 2L + L = 3L = 60 \u2192 L = 20\n\nThen, A = (20)\u00b2 / 2 = 400 / 2 = 200.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo, in all these approaches, the area comes out to be 200 square meters.\n\nI think it's clear that the area of the garden is 200 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
