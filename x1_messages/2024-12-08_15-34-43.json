        "content": "So there are 10 red balls and 20 blue balls in a box, making a total of 30 balls. You're picking one ball, looking at its color, putting it back, and then picking another ball. You want to know the probability that both balls are blue.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the probability of picking a blue ball on the first draw. There are 20 blue balls out of 30 total balls, so the probability is 20/30, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nNow, because you're putting the ball back after the first draw, the total number of balls remains the same for the second draw. So, the probability of picking a blue ball on the second draw is also 2/3.\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen\u2014both balls being blue\u2014you need to multiply the probabilities of each event since they are independent events.\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being blue is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Independent events mean that the outcome of the first event doesn't affect the second, which is true here because you're putting the ball back. So, yes, the probabilities remain the same for each draw.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of it in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to pick two balls with replacement is 30 * 30 = 900 possible outcomes.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two blue balls is 20 * 20 = 400.\n\nSo, the probability is 400/900, which simplifies to 4/9.\n\nHmm, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. The probability of picking a blue ball on the first draw is 20/30 = 2/3. Since we're replacing the ball, the probability remains the same for the second draw, so again 2/3. Multiplying them gives us (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn't replace the ball, the events would be dependent, and the probabilities would change for the second draw based on the first. But in this case, since we are replacing, they remain independent.\n\nI think 4/9 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{9}} \\]"
