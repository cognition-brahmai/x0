        "content": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is:\n\n4x - 7 = 5x + 8\n\nFirst, I need to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. To do this, I can subtract 4x from both sides of the equation to eliminate the x term on the left side.\n\nSo, subtracting 4x from both sides:\n\n4x - 7 - 4x = 5x + 8 - 4x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-7 = x + 8\n\nNow, I need to isolate x. To do this, I can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation.\n\nSo, subtracting 8 from both sides:\n\n-7 - 8 = x + 8 - 8\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-15 = x\n\nTherefore, the solution is x = -15.\n\nTo verify, I can plug this value back into the original equation to check if it holds true.\n\nPlugging x = -15 into the left side:\n\n4(-15) - 7 = -60 - 7 = -67\n\nPlugging x = -15 into the right side:\n\n5(-15) + 8 = -75 + 8 = -67\n\nSince both sides equal -67, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-15} \\]"
