        "content": "So, there are 4 cats, each sitting in one corner of a square room, and they're all facing the center. When they start walking towards the cat directly across from them, I need to figure out how many times they cross paths.\n\nFirst, let's visualize this. Imagine a square room, and each cat is in one corner. So, cat A is at corner A, cat B at corner B, cat C at corner C, and cat D at corner D. Since they're facing the center, each cat is looking towards the center of the square.\n\nNow, each cat starts walking towards the cat directly across from them. So, cat A would walk towards cat C, and cat B towards cat D, assuming that across means opposite corners.\n\nWait a minute, in a square, opposite corners are diagonally across from each other. So, if cat A is at one corner, cat C is at the opposite corner, and similarly, cat B is opposite cat D.\n\nSo, if they all start walking towards their opposite cat, their paths would be along the diagonals of the square.\n\nIn that case, since they're all moving towards their opposite at the same time, they would all move along the diagonals towards each other.\n\nNow, in a square, the two diagonals intersect at the center point. So, if cats A and C are walking towards each other along one diagonal, and cats B and D are walking towards each other along the other diagonal, they would all meet at the center.\n\nBut the question is, how many times do their paths cross?\n\nWell, since they're all moving directly towards each other along straight lines, their paths would only cross once, at the center of the square.\n\nWait, but actually, their paths cross at the center, but do they cross each other's paths multiple times?\n\nLet me think differently. If the cats are moving at constant speeds and they all start at the same time, they should all meet at the center simultaneously.\n\nSo, in that case, their paths cross only once, at the center.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if they keep moving after meeting at the center.\n\nWait, the question says they start walking towards the cat directly across from them. It doesn't specify if they stop once they reach the center or if they continue past the center.\n\nIf they continue moving beyond the center, towards their original target, then cats A and C would pass each other at the center and continue to where cat C and A were starting, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, cats B and D would do the same.\n\nBut in that case, do their paths cross again?\n\nWell, their paths are straight lines along the diagonals, so they only cross once, at the center.\n\nEven if they continue moving beyond the center, their paths don't cross again because the straight lines don't intersect again.\n\nSo, overall, they only cross paths once, at the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the trajectories.\n\nEach cat is moving directly towards its opposite cat. But as they move, the target is also moving.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that each cat is not just moving towards a fixed point but is adjusting its direction as the target moves.\n\nIf that's the case, then their paths would not be straight lines but curved paths converging towards each other.\n\nThis sounds like a classic problem where each object moves towards another moving object.\n\nIn such cases, the paths are not straight lines but curves, often spiraling towards the center.\n\nBut in this scenario, since they're moving towards their directly opposite cat, and both are moving, perhaps their paths would be straight lines after all.\n\nWait, no. If each cat is always moving directly towards the opposite cat, and both are moving, their paths would curve towards each other.\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of mice in a square, where each mouse moves towards the next one in a cycle, and their paths form logarithmic spirals.\n\nBut in this case, each cat is moving towards the cat directly across from them, not to the next one.\n\nSo, perhaps the paths would be straight lines.\n\nLet me consider the mechanics.\n\nIf cat A is moving towards cat C, and cat C is moving towards cat A, along the diagonal, and similarly for cats B and D.\n\nIf they both move directly towards each other along the diagonal, their paths are straight lines along the diagonals.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other along straight lines, they should meet at the center.\n\nAnd since their paths are straight lines, they only cross once at the center.\n\nUnless their movement causes them to curve off path, but if they're moving directly towards the opposite cat, and both are moving along the straight diagonal, they should meet at the center.\n\nSo, in this case, their paths cross only once.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that they cross paths once.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
