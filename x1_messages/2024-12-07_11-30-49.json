        "content": "So I've got this problem here about optimizing a supermarket chain's supply chain by building a centralized distribution center. There are 200 stores across the country, and on average, each store is 150 miles away from the distribution center. Each store gets deliveries twice a week, and the trucks used can carry up to 25 tons of goods. I need to calculate the total weekly transportation cost, considering fuel costs are $3 per gallon, trucks get 6 miles per gallon, and drivers earn $20 per hour.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. It's about calculating the total weekly transportation cost for all these stores. Transportation cost would include both fuel costs and driver costs, right? So, I need to figure out how much fuel is used per delivery and how much time the driver spends per delivery, then multiply that by the number of deliveries per week.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Determine the distance traveled per delivery.\n\nEach store is on average 150 miles away from the distribution center. So, for a round trip (going to the store and coming back), the distance would be 150 miles * 2 = 300 miles per delivery.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the fuel consumption per delivery.\n\nTrucks have an average fuel efficiency of 6 miles per gallon. So, for 300 miles, the fuel required would be:\n\nFuel per delivery = Distance per delivery / Fuel efficiency\n\nFuel per delivery = 300 miles / 6 miles per gallon = 50 gallons per delivery.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the fuel cost per delivery.\n\nFuel costs $3 per gallon, so:\n\nFuel cost per delivery = Fuel per delivery * Cost per gallon\n\nFuel cost per delivery = 50 gallons * $3/gallon = $150 per delivery.\n\nStep 4: Determine the time spent per delivery.\n\nI need to find out how much time the driver spends per delivery to calculate their earnings. To find the time, I need to know the speed of the truck. However, the problem doesn't specify the speed. Maybe I can assume an average speed.\n\nLet's assume the trucks travel at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. This seems reasonable for long-distance trucking.\n\nSo, time to travel to the store:\n\nTime to store = Distance to store / Speed\n\nTime to store = 150 miles / 50 mph = 3 hours.\n\nRound trip would be double that:\n\nTotal time per delivery = 3 hours * 2 = 6 hours.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the driver's cost per delivery.\n\nDrivers earn $20 per hour, so:\n\nDriver cost per delivery = Time per delivery * Hourly wage\n\nDriver cost per delivery = 6 hours * $20/hour = $120 per delivery.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total cost per delivery.\n\nTotal cost per delivery = Fuel cost per delivery + Driver cost per delivery\n\nTotal cost per delivery = $150 + $120 = $270 per delivery.\n\nStep 7: Determine the number of deliveries per week.\n\nEach store receives deliveries twice a week. There are 200 stores.\n\nTotal deliveries per week = Number of stores * Deliveries per store per week\n\nTotal deliveries per week = 200 stores * 2 deliveries/store/week = 400 deliveries per week.\n\nStep 8: Calculate the total weekly transportation cost.\n\nTotal weekly transportation cost = Total cost per delivery * Total deliveries per week\n\nTotal weekly transportation cost = $270/delivery * 400 deliveries/week = $108,000 per week.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of money. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, distance per delivery: 150 miles one way, so 300 miles round trip. That seems correct.\n\nFuel consumption: 300 miles / 6 mpg = 50 gallons. Fuel cost: 50 gallons * $3/gallon = $150. That's fine.\n\nTime per delivery: 150 miles / 50 mph = 3 hours one way, so 6 hours round trip. Driver cost: 6 hours * $20/hour = $120. Total cost per delivery: $150 + $120 = $270.\n\nTotal deliveries per week: 200 stores * 2 deliveries/store/week = 400 deliveries/week.\n\nTotal weekly cost: $270/delivery * 400 deliveries/week = $108,000/week.\n\nHmm, $108,000 per week seems quite high, but based on the given assumptions, it adds up. Maybe the assumption about the speed is off. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trucks make multiple deliveries in a day, reducing the total number of required deliveries and thus the total cost. But the problem states that each store receives deliveries twice a week, so presumably, each delivery is exclusive to each store.\n\nWait, maybe the trucks can carry deliveries for multiple stores in one trip. The trucks can carry up to 25 tons, but we don't know the average weight per store delivery. If the deliveries are small, one truck could serve multiple stores in a single trip.\n\nThis could significantly reduce the total number of truck trips needed.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nFirst, I need to know the average weight of goods delivered to each store per delivery.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the average weight per store per delivery. It only gives the truck capacity of 25 tons.\n\nWithout knowing the average weight per store delivery, I can't determine how many stores one truck can serve in a single trip.\n\nThis might be a missing piece of information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all stores have the same delivery weight, but without specifying, I can't proceed with this assumption.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that each truck delivers to only one store per trip, meaning each delivery is a separate truck trip.\n\nGiven that, my earlier calculation would hold.\n\nBut if trucks can serve multiple stores in one trip, the total number of truck trips would be lower, reducing the total transportation cost.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the delivery weights per store, I might have to assume that each truck serves only one store per trip.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the total weight delivered per week and see how many truck trips that would require.\n\nBut again, without knowing the average weight per store per delivery, it's hard to determine.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this differently.\n\nLet's assume that each store receives deliveries twice a week, and each delivery is a full truckload of 25 tons.\n\nSo, each store gets 2 * 25 tons = 50 tons per week.\n\nWith 200 stores, the total weekly delivery volume would be:\n\nTotal weekly delivery volume = 200 stores * 50 tons/store/week = 10,000 tons per week.\n\nNow, if each truck can carry 25 tons, the total number of truckloads needed per week would be:\n\nTotal truckloads per week = Total weekly delivery volume / Truck capacity\n\nTotal truckloads per week = 10,000 tons / 25 tons/truck = 400 truckloads per week.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation where I had 400 deliveries per week.\n\nSo, proceeding with that.\n\nNow, each truckload involves a round trip of 300 miles, fuel consumption of 50 gallons, fuel cost of $150, and driver cost of $120, totaling $270 per truckload.\n\nTotal weekly transportation cost would be 400 truckloads * $270/truckload = $108,000 per week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trucks can make multiple trips per day, reducing the total number of trucks needed, but the overall transportation cost would remain the same.\n\nWait, actually, the total transportation cost includes both fuel and driver costs. If a truck can make multiple trips in a week, the driver is being utilized more efficiently.\n\nBut in my initial calculation, each truckload is a separate trip, with the driver being paid for each trip.\n\nHowever, drivers may work a certain number of hours per day or per week, so there might be constraints on how many trips they can make.\n\nBut given the complexity, and since the problem doesn't provide further details, perhaps it's acceptable to stick with the initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate based on driver hours per week.\n\nAssuming drivers work, say, 40 hours per week, and each trip takes 6 hours, then each driver can make 40 / 6 \u2248 6.67 trips per week. Let's say 6 trips per week per driver.\n\nThen, the number of drivers needed would be:\n\nTotal truckloads per week / Trips per driver per week = 400 / 6 \u2248 66.67 drivers. So, 67 drivers.\n\nThen, driver costs would be 67 drivers * 40 hours/week * $20/hour = $53,600 per week.\n\nFuel costs would be 400 truckloads * $150/truckload = $60,000 per week.\n\nTotal transportation cost: $53,600 + $60,000 = $113,600 per week.\n\nThis is slightly higher than my initial calculation of $108,000, due to fractional trips not being fully utilized.\n\nBut perhaps this is splitting hairs, and the initial straightforward calculation is acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the total weekly transportation cost being approximately $108,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{108000}"
