        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 6 red balls and 4 blue balls. I need to find the probability of picking a red ball both times when I pick one ball, put it back, and then pick another one. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls in the bag. There are 6 red and 4 blue, so that's a total of 10 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a red ball on the first try. Since there are 6 red balls out of 10 total balls, the probability should be 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nNext, I put the ball back. That means the total number of balls remains the same for the second pick. So, again, the probability of picking a red ball the second time is also 3/5.\n\nSince these are two independent events\u2014meaning the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick because I'm putting the ball back\u2014I can find the probability of both events happening by multiplying their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball both times should be (3/5) * (3/5) = 9/25.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Independent events, replacement involved, so yes, the probabilities multiply.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to pick two balls with replacement is 10 * 10 = 100, since each pick is independent and there are 10 options each time.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes,\u5373 picking a red ball both times, would be 6 * 6 = 36, since there are 6 red balls each time.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 36/100, which simplifies to 9/25.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using probability rules or formulas.\n\nThe formula for the probability of two independent events A and B both occurring is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nIn this case, A is picking a red ball the first time, and B is picking a red ball the second time. Both have probabilities of 3/5, so P(A and B) = (3/5) * (3/5) = 9/25.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm not confusing this with without replacement. If it was without replacement, the probabilities would change for the second pick, but since it's with replacement, the probabilities stay the same.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the probability of picking a red ball both times is 9/25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{25}} \\]"
