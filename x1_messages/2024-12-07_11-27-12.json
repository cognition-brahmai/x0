        "content": "So I've got this sequence problem here. It says that each term after the first is twice the previous term, and the first term is 3. I need to find the sum of the first five terms.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the sequence. The first term is given as 3. So, a\u2081 = 3.\n\nNow, each subsequent term is twice the previous one. So, the second term a\u2082 would be 2 times a\u2081, which is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nSimilarly, the third term a\u2083 is twice a\u2082, so 2 * 6 = 12.\n\nThe fourth term a\u2084 is twice a\u2083, so 2 * 12 = 24.\n\nAnd the fifth term a\u2085 is twice a\u2084, which is 2 * 24 = 48.\n\nSo, the first five terms are: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48.\n\nNow, to find the sum of these terms, I just need to add them up:\n\nSum = a\u2081 + a\u2082 + a\u2083 + a\u2084 + a\u2085 = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48.\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n3 + 6 = 9\n\n9 + 12 = 21\n\n21 + 24 = 45\n\n45 + 48 = 93\n\nSo, the sum of the first five terms is 93.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to do this without adding each term individually? I think there is. This sequence seems to be a geometric sequence, where each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term.\n\nIn this case, the common ratio r is 2, since each term is twice the previous one.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is:\n\nSum_n = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this problem, a = 3, r = 2, n = 5.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nSum_5 = 3 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 2^5: 2^5 = 32\n\nThen, 32 - 1 = 31\n\nDenominator is 2 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, Sum_5 = 3 * 31 / 1 = 93\n\nThat matches the sum I got by adding the terms individually.\n\nGood, so the sum is indeed 93.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's verify the terms again:\n\na\u2081 = 3\n\na\u2082 = 2 * 3 = 6\n\na\u2083 = 2 * 6 = 12\n\na\u2084 = 2 * 12 = 24\n\na\u2085 = 2 * 24 = 48\n\nSum: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which is Sum_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), but since r is 2, which is greater than 1, the first formula is more straightforward.\n\nBut just to show, using Sum_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r):\n\nSum_5 = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2) = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1) = 3 * (-31) / (-1) = 3 * 31 = 93\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I get the sum as 93.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first five terms is 93.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{93} \\]"
