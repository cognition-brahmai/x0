        "content": "Sure, I can help with that! To create a SQL query that retrieves the total amount spent by each customer from the \"Orders\" and \"Customers\" tables, we'll need to join these two tables based on the CustomerID field and then group the results by customer to calculate the total amount spent.\n\nHere's how you can structure the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    c.CustomerID,\n    c.FirstName,\n    c.LastName,\n    SUM(o.Amount) AS TotalAmountSpent\nFROM \n    Customers c\nJOIN \n    Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID\nGROUP BY \n    c.CustomerID, c.FirstName, c.LastName\nORDER BY \n    TotalAmountSpent DESC;\n```\n\nLet me break down what this query does:\n\n1. **SELECT Clause**: We select the customer's ID, first name, last name, and the sum of the amounts from the orders they've made.\n\n2. **FROM Clause**: We specify the \"Customers\" table and alias it as \"c\" for convenience.\n\n3. **JOIN Clause**: We join the \"Orders\" table (aliased as \"o\") with the \"Customers\" table on the CustomerID field. This connects each order to the customer who made it.\n\n4. **GROUP BY Clause**: We group the results by customer ID, first name, and last name. This is necessary because we're using an aggregate function (SUM) to calculate the total amount spent by each customer.\n\n5. **ORDER BY Clause**: Finally, we sort the results in descending order based on the total amount spent, so customers who have spent the most appear first.\n\nThis query should give you a list of customers along with their total spending, sorted from highest to lowest.
