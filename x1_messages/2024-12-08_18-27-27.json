        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle with an area of 60 square units. The length is said to be 5 units more than twice its width. We need to find the dimensions, which are the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if we denote the width as \\( w \\), then the length would be \\( 2w + 5 \\), according to the problem.\n\nSo, the area equation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\\\\n60 = (2w + 5) \\times w\n\\]\n\nNow, let's expand this equation:\n\n\\[\n60 = 2w^2 + 5w\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( w \\), we need to rearrange this equation into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n2w^2 + 5w - 60 = 0\n\\]\n\nOkay, now we have a quadratic equation. I can solve this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to \\( 2 \\times (-60) = -120 \\) and add up to \\( 5 \\). Hmm, let's see... how about 15 and -8?\n\n\\[\n15 \\times (-8) = -120 \\\\\n15 + (-8) = 7\n\\]\n\nNo, that's not right. 7 is not 5. Let's try again.\n\nWhat about 12 and -10?\n\n\\[\n12 \\times (-10) = -120 \\\\\n12 + (-10) = 2\n\\]\n\nNot 5. Hmm.\n\nMaybe 20 and -6?\n\n\\[\n20 \\times (-6) = -120 \\\\\n20 + (-6) = 14\n\\]\n\nStill not 5.\n\nAlright, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Perhaps factoring isn't the easiest way here. Let's try the quadratic formula instead.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor our equation \\( 2w^2 + 5w - 60 = 0 \\), the coefficients are:\n\n\\[\na = 2, b = 5, c = -60\n\\]\n\nPlugging these into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times (-60)}}{2 \\times 2} \\\\\nw = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 480}}{4} \\\\\nw = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{505}}{4}\n\\]\n\nHmm, \\( \\sqrt{505} \\) doesn't simplify nicely, does it? Let me check if I did something wrong earlier.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can factor \\( 2w^2 + 5w - 60 = 0 \\) differently. Let's try grouping.\n\nFirst, multiply the leading coefficient (2) by the constant term (-60):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (-60) = -120\n\\]\n\nNow, find two numbers that multiply to -120 and add up to the middle coefficient (5). As before, I'm struggling to find such numbers easily. Maybe quadratic formula is indeed the way to go.\n\nSo, going back to:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{505}}{4}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate the discriminant to see if it's a perfect square.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{505}\n\\]\n\n505 is 5 times 101, and 101 is a prime number, so \\( \\sqrt{505} \\) is irrational. That means the width will be a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, the width \\( w \\) is:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{505}}{4} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad w = \\frac{-5 - \\sqrt{505}}{4}\n\\]\n\nSince width can't be negative, we discard the negative solution. So:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{505}}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the approximate value of \\( w \\).\n\nFirst, find \\( \\sqrt{505} \\). Let's see, 22 squared is 484, and 23 squared is 529. So, \\( \\sqrt{505} \\) is between 22 and 23. Maybe around 22.47.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{505} \\approx 22.47\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nw \\approx \\frac{-5 + 22.47}{4} \\approx \\frac{17.47}{4} \\approx 4.37 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nNow, the length is \\( 2w + 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nl \\approx 2 \\times 4.37 + 5 \\approx 8.74 + 5 \\approx 13.74 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nWait a second, but the area is supposed to be 60 square units. Let's check if these dimensions give us approximately 60.\n\n\\[\nl \\times w \\approx 13.74 \\times 4.37 \\approx 60.00 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nThat checks out. So, the dimensions are approximately 4.37 units for the width and 13.74 units for the length.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to get exact values without approximating. Let's see.\n\nSince \\( w = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{505}}{4} \\), and \\( l = 2w + 5 \\), we can express the length in terms of the width.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in assuming the quadratic couldn't be factored easily. Let me try again.\n\nLet me attempt to factor \\( 2w^2 + 5w - 60 = 0 \\).\n\nI need to find two numbers that multiply to \\( 2 \\times (-60) = -120 \\) and add up to 5.\n\nLet's list the factor pairs of -120:\n\n- 1 and -120\n\n- 2 and -60\n\n- 3 and -40\n\n- 4 and -30\n\n- 5 and -24\n\n- 6 and -20\n\n- 8 and -15\n\n- 10 and -12\n\nLooking for a pair that adds up to 5.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- 10 + (-12) = -2\n\n- 8 + (-15) = -7\n\n- 5 + (-24) = -19\n\n- 6 + (-20) = -14\n\n- 3 + (-40) = -37\n\n- 4 + (-30) = -26\n\n- 2 + (-60) = -58\n\n- 1 + (-120) = -119\n\nHmm, none of these add up to 5. Maybe I need to consider fractions, but since the coefficients are integers, perhaps I missed a pair.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Perhaps the quadratic doesn't factor nicely, and using the quadratic formula is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use completing the square.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[\n2w^2 + 5w - 60 = 0\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 2 to make the leading coefficient 1:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + \\frac{5}{2}w - 30 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, move the constant term to the other side:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + \\frac{5}{2}w = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, to complete the square, take half of the coefficient of w, square it, and add it to both sides.\n\nHalf of \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\) is \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), and squaring it gives \\( \\frac{25}{16} \\).\n\nAdd \\( \\frac{25}{16} \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + \\frac{5}{2}w + \\frac{25}{16} = 30 + \\frac{25}{16}\n\\]\n\nConvert 30 to sixteenths:\n\n\\[\n30 = \\frac{480}{16}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{480}{16} + \\frac{25}{16} = \\frac{505}{16}\n\\]\n\nNow, the left side is a perfect square:\n\n\\[\n\\left( w + \\frac{5}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{505}{16}\n\\]\n\nTaking square roots of both sides:\n\n\\[\nw + \\frac{5}{4} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{505}{16}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{505}}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nw = -\\frac{5}{4} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{505}}{4}\n\\]\n\nAgain, width can't be negative, so we take the positive solution:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{505}}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis matches what I got earlier with the quadratic formula.\n\nSo, the exact width is \\( \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{505}}{4} \\) units, and the length is \\( 2w + 5 \\), which is:\n\n\\[\nl = 2 \\left( \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{505}}{4} \\right) + 5 = \\frac{-10 + 2\\sqrt{505}}{4} + 5 = \\frac{-10 + 2\\sqrt{505}}{4} + \\frac{20}{4} = \\frac{10 + 2\\sqrt{505}}{4} = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{505}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exact dimensions are:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{505}}{4} \\text{ units} \\\\\nl = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{505}}{2} \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer approximate values:\n\n\\[\nw \\approx 4.37 \\text{ units} \\\\\nl \\approx 13.74 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nThere you have it! The dimensions of the rectangle are approximately 4.37 units in width and 13.74 units in length.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{width} \\approx 4.37 \\text{ units}, \\text{ length} \\approx 13.74 \\text{ units}} \\]"
