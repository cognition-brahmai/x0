        "content": "So I have this probability problem here. There are 8 taxis numbered from 1 to 8, and any one of them could arrive when I call for a taxi. I need to find the probability that the taxi number is either an even number or a multiple of 3. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is 8, since there are 8 taxis.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these taxis have numbers that are either even or multiples of 3. Let's list out the numbers from 1 to 8 and identify which ones meet these criteria.\n\nNumbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nEven numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8\n\nMultiples of 3: 3, 6\n\nSo, the numbers that are either even or multiples of 3 are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.\n\nWait, let me check that. I need to make sure I'm not missing any or double-counting. The number 6 is both even and a multiple of 3, but in probability, when we say \"A or B,\" we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to avoid double-counting.\n\nThe formula for the probability of A or B is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), where P(A and B) is the probability of both A and B occurring.\n\nIn this context:\n\n- A is the event that the number is even.\n\n- B is the event that the number is a multiple of 3.\n\n- A and B is the event that the number is both even and a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, first, let's find P(A), the probability that the number is even.\n\nEven numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8 \u2192 4 out of 8 \u2192 P(A) = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nNext, P(B), the probability that the number is a multiple of 3.\n\nMultiples of 3: 3, 6 \u2192 2 out of 8 \u2192 P(B) = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nNow, P(A and B), the probability that the number is both even and a multiple of 3.\n\nNumbers that are both: 6 \u2192 1 out of 8 \u2192 P(A and B) = 1/8.\n\nNow, using the formula:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 1/2 + 1/4 - 1/8.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 2, 4, and 8 is 8.\n\nSo, converting each fraction:\n\n1/2 = 4/8\n\n1/4 = 2/8\n\n1/8 remains 1/8.\n\nNow, P(A or B) = 4/8 + 2/8 - 1/8 = (4 + 2 - 1)/8 = 5/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the taxi number is an even number or a multiple of 3 is 5/8.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's list out the numbers again:\n\nTotal taxis: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\nEven numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nMultiples of 3: 3, 6.\n\nSo, combining these without double-counting: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8. That's 5 numbers.\n\nSo, probability should be 5 out of 8, which is indeed 5/8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about the problem differently. Since the events are not mutually exclusive (there is overlap with number 6), I need to use the inclusion-exclusion principle, which is what I did.\n\nSo, the answer is 5/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}} \\]"
