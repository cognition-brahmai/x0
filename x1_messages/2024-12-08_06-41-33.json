Like, treating others the way you'd want to be treated. It's like that golden rule, right? But then again, I also think that finding something you're passionate about is really important. Something that makes you get out of bed in the morning, even on rainy days like this. For me, it's baseball, but for other people, it might be art or music or helping others. And of course, having friends who support you through thick and thin is priceless. So maybe it's a combination of all those things. What do you think, Snoopy?"
