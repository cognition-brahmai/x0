        "content": "To determine how many distinct triangles can be formed using any three vertices of a regular octagon, we need to calculate the number of combinations of three points from the eight vertices of the octagon.\n\nFirst, recall that a regular octagon has eight vertices, and we want to choose any three of them to form a triangle. The number of ways to choose three points from eight is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\), so we have:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8 - 3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\cdot 5!}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the factorials:\n\n\\[\n8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40320\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{40320}{6 \\times 120} = \\frac{40320}{720} = 56\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 56 distinct triangles that can be formed using any three vertices of a regular octagon.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in a regular octagon, some of these triangles may be congruent due to the symmetry of the figure. But the problem is asking for the number of distinct triangles based on their vertex selections, not considering congruence. Hence, the total number remains 56.\n\nIf the question were about the number of distinct triangles up to congruence, the answer would be different, as some triangles would be considered the same due to the symmetries of the octagon. But based on the wording, we are to count all possible unique sets of three vertices, regardless of the triangles' shapes or sizes.\n\nSo, the final answer is 56 distinct triangles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]"
