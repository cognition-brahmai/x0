Both of these properties are located on the final stretch of the board and are part of the Dark Purple (or Brown, in some editions) property group. Boardwalk costs $400 to purchase, and Park Place costs $350. These properties are highly sought after because they offer the highest rental incomes when developed with houses or hotels."
