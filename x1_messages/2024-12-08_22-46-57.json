        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units of product A each day, and each unit costs $25 to make. You want to know how much it will cost to produce 7,500 units in total.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total cost for 7,500 units. Since each unit costs $25, I can multiply the number of units by the cost per unit to get the total cost.\n\nSo, that would be 7,500 units times $25 per unit.\n\nLet me do the math: 7,500 \u00d7 25.\n\nWell, 7,500 times 20 is 150,000, and 7,500 times 5 is 37,500. Adding those together, 150,000 plus 37,500 equals 187,500.\n\nSo, the total cost to produce 7,500 units is $187,500.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the factory produces 500 units per day at $25 each, the daily cost is 500 times 25, which is 12,500 dollars per day.\n\nNow, to produce 7,500 units, I can divide 7,500 by 500 to find out how many days it will take.\n\n7,500 divided by 500 is 15 days.\n\nThen, multiplying the number of days by the daily cost: 15 days times $12,500 per day.\n\nLet's calculate that: 15 \u00d7 12,500.\n\n10 times 12,500 is 125,000, and 5 times 12,500 is 62,500. Adding them together, 125,000 plus 62,500 equals 187,500.\n\nSo, again, the total cost is $187,500.\n\nIt matches my first calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{187500} \\]"
