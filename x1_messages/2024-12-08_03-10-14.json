        "content": "Let's see. There are red chairs, blue chairs, and green chairs in the room. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue chair.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of chairs in the room. There are 4 red, 6 blue, and 5 green chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 4 plus 6 plus 5. Let me add those up: 4 plus 6 is 10, and then 10 plus 5 is 15. So, there are 15 chairs in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue chair. Probability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue chair. So, I need to find the total number of red and blue chairs combined. There are 4 red chairs and 6 blue chairs, so 4 plus 6 is 10. So, there are 10 favorable chairs.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the total number of chairs, which is 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking either a red or a blue chair is 10 divided by 15.\n\nI can simplify that fraction. Both 10 and 15 are divisible by 5. 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, the simplified fraction is 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this probability as a decimal or a percentage. 2 divided by 3 is approximately 0.6667, which is about 66.67%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form of the answer, I can probably leave it as a fraction.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it another way to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the probability of not picking a green chair, since the only other chairs are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green chairs is 5, and the total number of chairs is 15. So, the probability of picking a green chair is 5/15, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green chair (i.e., picking either red or blue) is 1 minus the probability of picking green.\n\nSo, 1 minus 1/3 is 2/3.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 2/3 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose one chair out of the 10 red and blue chairs is 10 choose 1, which is 10. The total number of ways to choose any one chair out of 15 is 15 choose 1, which is 15. So, the probability is again 10/15, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nNo matter how I look at it, I keep getting 2/3 as the answer.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but when you break them down step by step, they make sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
