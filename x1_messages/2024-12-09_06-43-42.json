The teacher tells the students that each box contains specific types of toys: action figures in the red box, stuffed animals in the blue box, and puzzles in the green box. During recess, the janitor accidentally mixes up the contents of the boxes while cleaning. After recess, the teacher asks the students to pick a toy from one of the boxes. Which type of toy does each student expect to find in each box?"

The mixing up of the contents by the janitor during recess would not be known to the students, so their expectations remain unchanged."
