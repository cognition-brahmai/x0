        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Python script that loads an image, applies different filters like blur and edge detection using OpenCV, and then displays the original and filtered images side by side for comparison, you'll need to have OpenCV installed. If you don't have it installed yet, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install opencv-python\n```\n\nOnce you have OpenCV installed, you can proceed with the following script. This script will load an image, apply Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection, and then display all three images side by side.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the image\nimage_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'  # Replace with your image path\nimage = cv2.imread(image_path)\n\n# Check if image is loaded properly\nif image is None:\n    print(\"Error: Could not open or find the image.\")\nelse:\n    # Apply Gaussian Blur\n    blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (15, 15), 0)\n\n    # Apply Canny Edge Detection\n    edges = cv2.Canny(image, 100, 200)\n\n    # Convert edges to a color image for stacking\n    edges_color = cv2.cvtColor(edges, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)\n\n    # Stack the images horizontally\n    combined = np.hstack((image, blurred, edges_color))\n\n    # Display the combined image\n    cv2.imshow('Original | Blurred | Edges', combined)\n    cv2.waitKey(0)\n    cv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loading the Image:**\n   - Use `cv2.imread()` to load the image from the specified path.\n   - Check if the image is loaded properly to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Applying Filters:**\n   - **Gaussian Blur:** Used to blur the image. The kernel size is set to (15, 15), but you can adjust this value for more or less blurring.\n   - **Canny Edge Detection:** Detects edges in the image. The thresholds (100 and 200) can be adjusted based on the image.\n\n3. **Displaying Images:**\n   - Since `cv2.Canny()` returns a grayscale image, we convert it to a color image using `cv2.cvtColor()` to match the color format of the original and blurred images.\n   - Use `np.hstack()` to stack the images horizontally.\n   - Display the combined image using `cv2.imshow()`.\n\nMake sure to replace `'path_to_your_image.jpg'` with the actual path to your image file. This script will open a window showing the original image, the blurred image, and the edge-detected image side by side for easy comparison.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further modifications, feel free to ask!"
