WebSearch[input]: This tool allows users to search for information on the internet. It returns a list of websites that may contain the answer to the user's query.\n2. TextExtractor[input]: This tool extracts text from a given website link. The input should be one or more links separated by newlines.\n3. LinkFinder[input]: This tool finds all the hyperlinks present in a given piece of text.\n4. KnowledgeBase[input]: A powerful question answering tool that can provide answers based on common sense, world knowledge, or context provided through an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [First action]\n:evidence0: = [Tool with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next tool with input parameter, possibly referencing previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what are some of their other works?"
