        "content": "Sure! Here's a simple Python function that checks if a number falls within a specified range:\n\n```python\ndef is_within_range(number, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    return lower_bound <= number <= upper_bound\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing the number you want to check, along with the lower and upper bounds of the range. It will return `True` if the number is within the range (inclusive), and `False` otherwise.\n\nHere's an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nnumber = 5\nlower_bound = 1\nupper_bound = 10\n\nif is_within_range(number, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    print(f\"{number} is within the range [{lower_bound}, {upper_bound}]\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{number} is outside the range [{lower_bound}, {upper_bound}]\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n5 is within the range [1, 10]\n```\n\nYou can adjust the `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` variables to define different ranges as needed."
