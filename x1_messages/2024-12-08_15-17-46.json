        "content": "Let's see. There's an item that costs $120, and there's a discount of 15%. I need to find out how much the customer has to pay after the discount is applied.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the discount amount is. A discount is a reduction in price, usually a percentage of the original price. So, 15% of $120 is the amount that will be subtracted from the original price.\n\nTo calculate 15% of $120, I can multiply 120 by 0.15 because percent means per hundred, so 15% is 15 per hundred, or 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nSo, discount amount = 120 * 0.15.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 120 times 0.15.\n\n120 times 0.1 is 12, and 120 times 0.05 is 6. So, 12 plus 6 is 18.\n\nSo, the discount amount is $18.\n\nNow, to find out the final price the customer has to pay, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nFinal price = original price - discount amount = 120 - 18.\n\nThat's $102.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 15% of 120 is indeed 18, because 120 times 0.15 is 18.\n\nThen, 120 minus 18 is 102.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the final price directly by multiplying the original price by (100% - discount percentage). So, in this case, it would be 120 times (100% - 15%) which is 120 times 85%.\n\nLet me try that: 120 times 0.85.\n\n120 times 0.8 is 96, and 120 times 0.05 is 6. So, 96 plus 6 is 102.\n\nAgain, $102.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the customer pays $102 for the item after the discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{102} \\]"
