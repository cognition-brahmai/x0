The construction cost of the roller coaster is estimated at $10 million, and the park expects an increase of 20% in annual visitors after its completion. The current number of annual visitors is 500,000, with an average ticket price of $50 per person. Calculate the additional revenue generated by the increased visitor count and determine how many years it will take for the roller coaster to pay for itself."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the amusement park is planning to build a new roller coaster that will cost $10 million. They expect that this will increase their annual visitors by 20%. Currently, they have 500,000 visitors per year, and the average ticket price is $50.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many additional visitors they'll get because of the new roller coaster. A 20% increase on 500,000 visitors would be:\n\nAdditional visitors = 500,000 * 20% = 500,000 * 0.2 = 100,000 visitors\n\nSo, they expect 100,000 more visitors each year after the roller coaster is built.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the additional revenue generated by these extra visitors. Since each visitor pays an average of $50, the additional revenue would be:\n\nAdditional revenue = 100,000 visitors * $50(visitor) = $5,000,000 per year\n\nNow, the park has to recoup the $10 million construction cost from this additional revenue. To find out how many years it will take to pay for itself, I can divide the construction cost by the annual additional revenue:\n\nPayback period = Construction cost / Additional revenue per year = $10,000,000 / $5,000,000 per year = 2 years\n\nSo, it will take 2 years for the additional revenue to cover the construction cost of the roller coaster.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? For example, are there any ongoing costs associated with running the roller coaster, like maintenance or operational costs? The problem doesn't mention any additional expenses, so I'll assume that the only cost is the initial construction cost.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the increase in visitors is directly due to the roller coaster and that other factors aren't affecting visitor numbers. But again, the problem states that the increase is expected after the completion of the roller coaster, so I'll attribute the entire increase to the new attraction.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the average ticket price might change in the future. But since no information is provided about price changes, I'll assume that the ticket price remains at $50 per person.\n\nI should also ensure that the 20% increase is accurate and that there aren't any variables that could affect the visitor count differently. For instance, maybe some current visitors will come more often because of the new roller coaster, but the problem specifies an increase in the number of visitors, so I think it's safe to assume that it's an addition to the current visitor base.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations:\n\nAdditional visitors: 500,000 * 0.2 = 100,000\n\nAdditional revenue: 100,000 * $50 = $5,000,000 per year\n\nPayback period: $10,000,000 / $5,000,000 per year = 2 years\n\nEverything seems to check out.\n\nSo, the additional revenue generated by the increased visitor count is $5,000,000 per year, and it will take 2 years for the roller coaster to pay for itself through this additional revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ years}} \\]"
