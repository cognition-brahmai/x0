The expression is:\n\n((8 - 3)^2 - (7 / 2) * 3) + 6 * 4 - 2\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, let's start with the innermost parentheses.\n\nFirst, calculate (8 - 3):\n\n8 - 3 = 5\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n(5^2 - (7 / 2) * 3) + 6 * 4 - 2\n\nNext, calculate the exponent:\n\n5^2 = 25\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n(25 - (7 / 2) * 3) + 6 * 4 - 2\n\nNext, handle the division and multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\nFirst, calculate 7 / 2:\n\n7 / 2 = 3.5\n\nThen, multiply that by 3:\n\n3.5 * 3 = 10.5\n\nNow, the expression inside the parentheses is:\n\n25 - 10.5\n\nCalculate that:\n\n25 - 10.5 = 14.5\n\nSo, the expression now is:\n\n14.5 + 6 * 4 - 2\n\nNext, perform the multiplication:\n\n6 * 4 = 24\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n14.5 + 24 - 2\n\nFinally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n14.5 + 24 = 38.5\n\nThen, 38.5 - 2 = 36.5\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36.5} \\]"
