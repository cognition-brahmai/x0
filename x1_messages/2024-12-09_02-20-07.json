        "content": "So the town has a total population of 8,000 people, and 55% of them are adults. I need to find out how many children there are. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, if 55% of the population are adults, then the remaining percentage must be children, right? So, I can calculate the percentage of children by subtracting the adult percentage from 100%.\n\nPercentage of children = 100% - 55% = 45%\n\nNow, to find the number of children, I need to find 45% of the total population, which is 8,000.\n\nSo, number of children = 45% of 8,000\n\nI know that \"of\" in mathematics usually means multiplication, and percent means per hundred, so 45% is the same as 45/100 or 0.45.\n\nTherefore, number of children = 0.45 \u00d7 8,000\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.45 \u00d7 8,000 = 3,600\n\nSo, there are 3,600 children in the town.\n\nWait a minute, just to double-check, maybe I should calculate the number of adults first and then subtract that from the total population to see if I get the same number of children.\n\nNumber of adults = 55% of 8,000 = 0.55 \u00d7 8,000 = 4,400\n\nThen, number of children = total population - number of adults = 8,000 - 4,400 = 3,600\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3,600 children is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the ratio of adults to children. If adults are 55% and children are 45%, then the ratio of adults to children is 55:45, which simplifies to 11:9.\n\nSo, for every 20 people, 11 are adults and 9 are children.\n\nTotal parts = 11 + 9 = 20\n\nEach part represents 8,000 / 20 = 400 people\n\nTherefore, number of children = 9 parts \u00d7 400 = 3,600\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that there are 3,600 children in the town.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3600} \\]"
