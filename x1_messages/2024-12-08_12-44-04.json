        "content": "Let's see. The average distance from Earth to the Moon is about 238,855 miles. If I'm traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, I can calculate the time it would take by dividing the distance by the speed.\n\nSo, time equals distance divided by speed. That would be 238,855 miles divided by 60 miles per hour. Let me do the math:\n\n238,855 \u00f7 60 = 3,980.9167 hours.\n\nBut that's a big number. Maybe it's better to convert it into days. There are 24 hours in a day, so:\n\n3,980.9167 hours \u00f7 24 hours/day = 165.8715 days.\n\nSo, it would take approximately 166 days to travel from Earth to the Moon at 60 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, spacecraft travel much faster. For example, the Apollo missions took about 3 days to reach the Moon. So, maybe I should consider that. But the question specifically says to travel at 60 miles per hour, so I think my calculation is correct for that scenario.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if the distance is accurate. The average distance to the Moon is indeed about 238,855 miles, so that seems right.\n\nAlso, the speed is constant at 60 mph, which is another assumption. In reality, travel through space involves acceleration and deceleration, and the effects of gravity from both Earth and the Moon would come into play.\n\nBut since this is a theoretical question, I'll stick with the simple calculation.\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 166 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{166 \\text{ days}} \\]"
