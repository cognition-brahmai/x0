Valiant noise was made on a stage at the end of the hall by an orchestra composed of men who looked as if they had just happened in. Soiled waiters ran to and fro, swooping down like hawks on the unwary in the throng; clattering along the aisles with trays covered with glasses; stumbling over women's skirts and charging two prices for everything but beer, all with a swiftness that blurred the view of the cocoanut palms and dusty monstrosities painted upon the walls of the room. A bouncer, with an immense load of business upon his hands, plunged about in the crowd, dragging bashful strangers to prominent chairs, ordering waiters here and there and quarreling furiously with men who wanted to sing with the orchestra.\nThe usual smoke cloud was present, but so dense that heads and arms seemed entangled in it. The rumble of conversation was replaced by a roar. Plenteous oaths heaved through the air. The room rang with the shrill voices of women bubbling o'er with drink-laughter. The chief element in the music of the orchestra was speed. The musicians played in intent fury. A woman was singing and smiling upon the stage, but no one took notice of her. The rate at which the piano, cornet and violins were going, seemed to impart wildness to the half-drunken crowd. Beer glasses were emptied at a gulp and conversation became a rapid chatter. The smoke eddied and swirled like a shadowy river hurrying toward some unseen falls. Pete and Maggie entered the hall and took chairs at a table near the door. The woman who was seated there made an attempt to occupy Pete's attention and, failing, went away.\nThree weeks had passed since the girl had left home. The air of spaniel-like dependence had been magnified and showed its direct effect in the peculiar off-handedness and ease of Pete's ways toward her.\nShe followed Pete's eyes with hers, anticipating with smiles gracious looks from him.\nA woman of brilliance and audacity, accompanied by a mere boy, came into the place and took seats near them.\nAt once Pete sprang to his feet, his face beaming with glad surprise.\n\"By Gawd, there's Nellie,\" he cried.\nHe went over to the table and held out an eager hand to the woman.\n\"Why, hello, Pete, me boy, how are you,\" said she, giving him her fingers.\nMaggie took instant note of the woman. She perceived that her black dress fitted her to perfection. Her linen collar and cuffs were spotless. Tan gloves were stretched over her well-shaped hands. A hat of a prevailing fashion perched jauntily upon her dark hair. She wore no jewelry and was painted with no apparent paint. She looked clear-eyed through the stares of the men.\n\"Sit down, and call your lady-friend over,\" she said cordially to Pete. At his beckoning Maggie came and sat between Pete and the mere boy.\n\"I thought yeh were gone away fer good,\" began Pete, at once. \"When did yeh git back? How did dat Buff'lo bus'ness turn out?\"\nThe woman shrugged her shoulders. \"Well, he didn't have as many stamps as he tried to make out, so I shook him, that's all.\"\n\"Well, I'm glad teh see yehs back in deh city,\" said Pete, with awkward gallantry.\nHe and the woman entered into a long conversation, exchanging reminiscences of days together. Maggie sat still, unable to formulate an intelligent sentence upon the conversation and painfully aware of it.\nShe saw Pete's eyes sparkle as he gazed upon the handsome stranger. He listened smilingly to all she said. The woman was familiar with all his affairs, asked him about mutual friends, and knew the amount of his salary.\nShe paid no attention to Maggie, looking toward her once or twice and apparently seeing the wall beyond.\nThe mere boy was sulky. In the beginning he had welcomed with acclamations the additions.\n\"Let's all have a drink! What'll you take, Nell? And you, Miss what's-your-name. Have a drink, Mr. -----, you, I mean.\"\nHe had shown a sprightly desire to do the talking for the company and tell all about his family. In a loud voice he declaimed on various topics. He assumed a patronizing air toward Pete. As Maggie was silent, he paid no attention to her. He made a great show of lavishing wealth upon the woman of brilliance and audacity.\n\"Do keep still, Freddie! You gibber like an ape, dear,\" said the woman to him. She turned away and devoted her attention to Pete.\n\"We'll have many a good time together again, eh?\"\n\"Sure, Mike,\" said Pete, enthusiastic at once.\n\"Say,\" whispered she, leaning forward, \"let's go over to Billie's and have a heluva time.\"\n\"Well, it's dis way! See?\" said Pete. \"I got dis lady frien' here.\"\n\"Oh, t'hell with her,\" argued the woman.\nPete appeared disturbed.\n\"All right,\" said she, nodding her head at him. \"All right for you! We'll see the next time you ask me to go anywheres with you.\"\nPete squirmed.\n\"Say,\" he said, beseechingly, \"come wid me a minit an' I'll tell yer why.\"\nThe woman waved her hand.\n\"Oh, that's all right, you needn't explain, you know. You wouldn't come merely because you wouldn't come, that's all there is of it.\"\nTo Pete's visible distress she turned to the mere boy, bringing him speedily from a terrific rage. He had been debating whether it would be the part of a man to pick a quarrel with Pete, or would he be justified in striking him savagely with his beer glass without warning. But he recovered himself when the woman turned to renew her smilings. He beamed upon her with an expression that was somewhat tipsy and inexpressibly tender.\n\"Say, shake that Bowery jay,\" requested he, in a loud whisper.\n\"Freddie, you are so droll,\" she replied.\nPete reached forward and touched the woman on the arm.\n\"Come out a minit while I tells yeh why I can't go wid yer. Yer doin' me dirt, Nell! I never taut ye'd do me dirt, Nell. Come on, will yer?\" He spoke in tones of injury.\n\"Why, I don't see why I should be interested in your explanations,\" said the woman, with a coldness that seemed to reduce Pete to a pulp.\nHis eyes pleaded with her. \"Come out a minit while I tells yeh.\"\nThe woman nodded slightly at Maggie and the mere boy, \"'Scuse me.\"\nThe mere boy interrupted his loving smile and turned a shrivelling glare upon Pete. His boyish countenance flushed and he spoke, in a whine, to the woman:\n\"Oh, I say, Nellie, this ain't a square deal, you know. You aren't goin' to leave me and go off with that duffer, are you? I should think--\"\n\"Why, you dear boy, of course I'm not,\" cried the woman, affectionately. She bended over and whispered in his ear. He smiled again and settled in his chair as if resolved to wait patiently.\nAs the woman walked down between the rows of tables, Pete was at her shoulder talking earnestly, apparently in explanation. The woman waved her hands with studied airs of indifference. The doors swung behind them, leaving Maggie and the mere boy seated at the table.\nMaggie was dazed. She could dimly perceive that something stupendous had happened. She wondered why Pete saw fit to remonstrate with the woman, pleading for forgiveness with his eyes. She thought she noted an air of submission about her leonine Pete. She was astounded.\nThe mere boy occupied himself with cock-tails and a cigar. He was tranquilly silent for half an hour. Then he bestirred himself and spoke.\n\"Well,\" he said, sighing, \"I knew this was the way it would be.\" There was another stillness. The mere boy seemed to be musing.\n\"She was pulling m'leg. That's the whole amount of it,\" he said, suddenly. \"It's a bloomin' shame the way that girl does. Why, I've spent over two dollars in drinks to-night. And she goes off with that plug-ugly who looks as if he had been hit in the face with a coin-die. I call it rocky treatment for a fellah like me. Here, waiter, bring me a cock-tail and make it damned strong.\"\nMaggie made no reply. She was watching the doors. \"It's a mean piece of business,\" complained the mere boy. He explained to her how amazing it was that anybody should treat him in such a manner. \"But I'll get square with her, you bet. She won't get far ahead of yours truly, you know,\" he added, winking. \"I'll tell her plainly that it was bloomin' mean business. And she won't come it over me with any of her 'now-Freddie-dears.' She thinks my name is Freddie, you know, but of course it ain't. I always tell these people some name like that, because if they got onto your right name they might use it sometime. Understand? Oh, they don't fool me much.\"\nMaggie was paying no attention, being intent upon the doors. The mere boy relapsed into a period of gloom, during which he exterminated a number of cock-tails with a determined air, as if replying defiantly to fate. He occasionally broke forth into sentences composed of invectives joined together in a long string.\nThe girl was still staring at the doors. After a time the mere boy began to see cobwebs just in front of his nose. He spurred himself into being agreeable and insisted upon her having a charlotte-russe and a glass of beer.\n\"They's gone,\" he remarked, \"they's gone.\" He looked at her through the smoke wreaths. \"Shay, lil' girl, we mightish well make bes' of it. You ain't such bad-lookin' girl, y'know. Not half bad. Can't come up to Nell, though. No, can't do it! Well, I should shay not! Nell fine-lookin' girl! F--i--n--ine. You look damn bad longsider her, but by y'self ain't so bad. Have to do anyhow. Nell gone. On'y you left. Not half bad, though.\"\nMaggie stood up.\n\"I'm going home,\" she said.\nThe mere boy started.\n\"Eh? What? Home,\" he cried, struck with amazement. \"I beg pardon, did hear say home?\"\n\"I'm going home,\" she repeated.\n\"Great Gawd, what hava struck,\" demanded the mere boy of himself, stupefied.\nIn a semi-comatose state he conducted her on board an up-town car, ostentatiously paid her fare, leered kindly at her through the rear window and fell off the steps.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 750 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

        "content": "BEGINOUTPUT\nI'm going to attempt to summarize this story for you. It's a bit complex, with a lot of characters and a dense atmosphere, so bear with me.\n\nSo, the story takes place in a lively hall filled with noise, smoke, and a bustling crowd. There are twenty-eight tables, twenty-eight women, and a large number of smoking men. There's an orchestra playing loudly on stage, and waiters are rushing around serving drinks and food. It seems like a typical rowdy gathering in a tavern or similar establishment.\n\nPete and Maggie enter this hall and sit down at a table near the door. Another woman tries to get Pete's attention but fails and leaves. It's been three weeks since Maggie left home, and it's clear that Pete and Maggie have some kind of relationship, perhaps romantic, given the way Maggie watches Pete and anticipates his smiles.\n\nA woman named Nellie arrives with a young man called Freddie. Pete is thrilled to see Nellie and goes over to greet her. Maggie notices that Nellie is well-dressed, attractive, and seems to command attention. Pete and Nellie start talking, reminiscing about their past, and Pete seems very happy to see her again. Maggie sits quietly, feeling left out and unable to contribute to the conversation.\n\nIt's evident that Pete and Nellie have a history together, possibly a romantic one, and Maggie feels uneasy about their interaction. Pete is attentive to Nellie, and she seems to know a lot about his life, including his salary and mutual friends. Nellie pays little attention to Maggie, which makes Maggie feel even more marginalized.\n\nFreddie, the young man accompanying Nellie, is initially friendly and wants to include everyone in drinks and conversations. However, he becomes sulky when Nellie starts paying more attention to Pete. He even considers causing a scene with Pete but holds back when Nellie turns her attention back to him.\n\nNellie suggests going to another place, Billie's, for more fun, but Pete hesitates because he has Maggie with him. Nellie dismisses Maggie, saying \"t'hell with her,\" but Pete is upset by this and tries to explain his situation to Nellie. Nellie, however, is not interested in listening and accuses Pete of not wanting to spend time with her.\n\nPete pleads with Nellie to step outside and talk, but she remains indifferent and eventually leaves with Pete to have a private conversation. This leaves Maggie and Freddie sitting alone at the table.\n\nMaggie is confused and hurt by Pete's behavior, while Freddie is angry that Nellie has left him for Pete. He complains about being treated unfairly and spends money on drinks, seemingly trying to win Nellie back or to forget about her rejection.\n\nAfter some time, Freddie comes to terms with the situation and decides to make the best of it, turning his attention to Maggie. He comments that Maggie isn't as attractive as Nellie but isn't bad-looking herself. He tries to engage Maggie, offering her food and drinks, but Maggie is disinterested and announces that she wants to go home.\n\nFreddie is surprised and a bit drunk by this point, but he accompanies Maggie to an uptown train, pays for her fare, and watches her leave, seeming to accept that Nellie is no longer available to him.\n\nSo, in summary, the story depicts a scene in a noisy, smoky hall where relationships and social dynamics are played out among the characters. Pete is caught between his current companion, Maggie, and his former flame, Nellie, causing tension and hurt feelings. Maggie feels overshadowed and eventually decides to leave, while Freddie, Nellie's companion, deals with his disappointment by trying to engage with Maggie but ultimately accepts that Nellie has moved on.\n\nI hope this summary helps you understand the story better.
