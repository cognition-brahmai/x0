        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Java program that connects to a PostgreSQL database, retrieves data from the \"employees\" table, calculates the total salary paid per department, and generates a CSV report with columns for department name and total salary.\n\nMake sure to have the PostgreSQL JDBC driver in your classpath. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website or include it via Maven.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.ResultSet;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.sql.Statement;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class EmployeeSalaryReport {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String jdbcUrl = \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase\";\n        String username = \"yourusername\";\n        String password = \"yourpassword\";\n\n        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, username, password)) {\n            Map<String, Double> departmentSalaries = new HashMap<>();\n\n            String query = \"SELECT department, salary FROM employees;\";\n            try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n                 ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query)) {\n\n                while (resultSet.next()) {\n                    String department = resultSet.getString(\"department\");\n                    double salary = resultSet.getDouble(\"salary\");\n\n                    departmentSalaries.merge(department, salary, Double::sum);\n                }\n            }\n\n            writeCSVReport(departmentSalaries, \"department_salaries_report.csv\");\n\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void writeCSVReport(Map<String, Double> departmentSalaries, String fileName) {\n        try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(fileName)) {\n            fileWriter.append(\"Department,Total Salary\\n\");\n            for (Map.Entry<String, Double> entry : departmentSalaries.entrySet()) {\n                fileWriter.append(entry.getKey()).append(\",\").append(String.valueOf(entry.getValue())).append(\"\\n\");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"CSV report generated successfully: \" + fileName);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Database Connection:**\n   - The program connects to a PostgreSQL database using the `DriverManager.getConnection` method with the provided JDBC URL, username, and password.\n\n2. **Data Retrieval:**\n   - It executes a SQL query to select the `department` and `salary` columns from the `employees` table.\n   - The results are stored in a `ResultSet`.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Salary per Department:**\n   - A `HashMap` is used to store the total salary for each department.\n   - As the `ResultSet` is iterated, the salaries are summed up for each department using the `merge` method of the `HashMap`.\n\n4. **Generating CSV Report:**\n   - The `writeCSVReport` method writes the department names and their corresponding total salaries to a CSV file.\n   - The CSV file is created using a `FileWriter`, and each department's data is appended to the file in the format `Department,Total Salary`.\n\n### Requirements:\n\n- Ensure you have the PostgreSQL JDBC driver in your project's classpath.\n- Replace `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase`, `yourusername`, and `yourpassword` with your actual database connection details.\n- Make sure the `employees` table exists in your database with columns `department` and `salary`.\n\nThis program will generate a CSV file named `department_salaries_report.csv` in the project's root directory, containing the department names and their respective total salaries."
