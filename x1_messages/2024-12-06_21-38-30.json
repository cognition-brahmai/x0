        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular garden that measures 20 meters by 15 meters, and I need to find out what the area is in square feet. The conversion factor given is 1 meter = 3.28084 feet. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the area of the garden in meters squared because that's how the dimensions are given. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length times width, right? So, 20 meters times 15 meters should give me the area in meters squared.\n\nLet me calculate that: 20 meters * 15 meters = 300 meters squared.\n\nNow, I need to convert that area from meters squared to feet squared. I have the conversion factor for meters to feet: 1 meter = 3.28084 feet. But, since we're dealing with area, I think I need to square the conversion factor as well.\n\nSo, to convert meters squared to feet squared, I should multiply the area in meters squared by (3.28084 feet)^2.\n\nLet me calculate that conversion factor: (3.28084)^2 = 10.7639 feet squared per meter squared.\n\nNow, to find the area in feet squared, I'll multiply the area in meters squared by this conversion factor.\n\nSo, 300 meters squared * 10.7639 feet squared/meter squared = 3229.17 feet squared.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 20 meters * 15 meters = 300 meters squared. That seems correct.\n\nThen, the conversion factor is (3.28084)^2 = 10.7639 feet squared per meter squared. Let me verify that.\n\n3.28084 * 3.28084 should indeed be approximately 10.7639. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, 300 * 10.7639 = 3229.17 feet squared.\n\nHmm, maybe it's correct, but I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to first convert each dimension from meters to feet and then multiply them to get the area in feet squared.\n\nSo, first convert 20 meters to feet: 20 meters * 3.28084 feet/meter = 65.6168 feet.\n\nThen convert 15 meters to feet: 15 meters * 3.28084 feet/meter = 49.2126 feet.\n\nNow, multiply these two to get the area in feet squared: 65.6168 feet * 49.2126 feet.\n\nLet me calculate that: 65.6168 * 49.2126 \u2248 3229.17 feet squared.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems that 3229.17 feet squared is the correct area.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me consider the precision of the conversion factor. The conversion factor given is 1 meter = 3.28084 feet, which is quite precise. Squaring that gives approximately 10.7639 feet squared per meter squared, which is also precise.\n\nMultiplying that by 300 meters squared gives 3229.17 feet squared. If I round it to a reasonable number of significant figures, considering the precision of the conversion factor, this should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the direct conversion formula for area. I know that 1 meter squared equals approximately 10.7639 feet squared, so multiplying by 300 should indeed give me 3229.17 feet squared.\n\nI think that's solid. Maybe I was just overthinking it initially.\n\nSo, the area of the garden is approximately 3229.17 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should check if there's another way to look at this. For example, using the exact fractional conversion instead of decimal approximations.\n\nI know that 1 meter is exactly 3.28084 feet, but perhaps there's an exact conversion factor for area.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that 1 foot is exactly 0.3048 meters, and derive the conversion factor from that.\n\nLet's try that. If 1 foot = 0.3048 meters, then 1 meter = 1/0.3048 feet.\n\nCalculating that, 1/0.3048 \u2248 3.28084 feet, which matches the given conversion factor.\n\nNow, for area, 1 meter squared = (3.28084 feet)^2 = 10.7639 feet squared, as I did before.\n\nSo, no, it seems like my initial approach was correct.\n\nPerhaps what's causing my uncertainty is the size of the number. 3229.17 square feet does seem like a large area, but considering that 20 meters by 15 meters is a sizable garden, it makes sense.\n\nTo put it in perspective, 1 meter is approximately 3.28 feet, so 20 meters is about 65.6 feet and 15 meters is about 49.2 feet. Multiplying these gives around 3229 square feet, which aligns with my calculation.\n\nAdditionally, I know that in the metric system, 1 meter squared is equal to 10.7639 feet squared, so multiplying by 300 should give me the total area in feet squared.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The area of the garden is approximately 3229.17 square feet.\n\nMaybe I can round it to two decimal places or even one, depending on the required precision. But since the conversion factor is given to five decimal places, perhaps retaining two decimal places is appropriate.\n\nSo, final answer: 3229.17 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3229.17} \\]"
