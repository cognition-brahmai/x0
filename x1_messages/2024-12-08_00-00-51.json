        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence defined by x_n = 2x_(n-1) + 3, and it starts with x_1 = 1. I need to find x_6. Okay, so I'll probably have to calculate each term step by step up to x_6.\n\nStarting with x_1 = 1.\n\nNow, x_2 = 2*x_1 + 3 = 2*1 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nNext, x_3 = 2*x_2 + 3 = 2*5 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13.\n\nThen, x_4 = 2*x_3 + 3 = 2*13 + 3 = 26 + 3 = 29.\n\nAfter that, x_5 = 2*x_4 + 3 = 2*29 + 3 = 58 + 3 = 61.\n\nFinally, x_6 = 2*x_5 + 3 = 2*61 + 3 = 122 + 3 = 125.\n\nSo, x_6 is 125.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to find x_6 without calculating each term one by one? Maybe there's a formula or a pattern I can exploit.\n\nLet me think about the general form of the sequence. The recurrence relation is x_n = 2x_(n-1) + 3.\n\nThis looks like a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. I think I can solve it to find a closed-form formula for x_n.\n\nFirst, I'll solve the homogeneous part: x_n - 2x_(n-1) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 2 = 0, so r = 2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is x_n^(h) = a*2^n.\n\nNow, I need a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation x_n = 2x_(n-1) + 3.\n\nSince the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), I'll assume a particular solution of the form x_n^(p) = c, where c is a constant.\n\nPlugging this into the recurrence relation:\n\nc = 2*c + 3.\n\nSolving for c: c - 2*c = 3 \u2192 -c = 3 \u2192 c = -3.\n\nSo, the particular solution is x_n^(p) = -3.\n\nTherefore, the general solution to the nonhomogeneous recurrence is x_n = x_n^(h) + x_n^(p) = a*2^n - 3.\n\nNow, I need to find the constant a using the initial condition x_1 = 1.\n\nPlugging n = 1 and x_1 = 1 into the general solution:\n\n1 = a*2^1 - 3 \u2192 1 = 2a - 3 \u2192 2a = 4 \u2192 a = 2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula for x_n is x_n = 2*2^n - 3 = 2^(n+1) - 3.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n = 1: x_1 = 2^(1+1) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1. Correct.\n\nn = 2: x_2 = 2^(3) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5. Correct.\n\nn = 3: 2^4 - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 4: 2^5 - 3 = 32 - 3 = 29. Correct.\n\nn = 5: 2^6 - 3 = 64 - 3 = 61. Correct.\n\nn = 6: 2^7 - 3 = 128 - 3 = 125. Same as earlier calculation. Good.\n\nSo, x_6 is indeed 125.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using iteration or some other method.\n\nLet me try iteration.\n\nStarting with x_n = 2x_(n-1) + 3.\n\nExpanding x_(n-1): x_n = 2*(2x_(n-2) + 3) + 3 = 4x_(n-2) + 6 + 3 = 4x_(n-2) + 9.\n\nAgain, expand x_(n-2): x_n = 4*(2x_(n-3) + 3) + 9 = 8x_(n-3) + 12 + 9 = 8x_(n-3) + 21.\n\nContinuing: x_n = 8*(2x_(n-4) + 3) + 21 = 16x_(n-4) + 24 + 21 = 16x_(n-4) + 45.\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here.\n\nEach time, the coefficient of x decreases by 1 in the subscript, and there's an added term that seems to follow a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express x_n in terms of x_1.\n\nGiven that x_1 = 1, let's see:\n\nx_2 = 2*x_1 + 3 = 2*1 + 3 = 5.\n\nx_3 = 2*x_2 + 3 = 2*(2*x_1 + 3) + 3 = 4*x_1 + 6 + 3 = 4*1 + 9 = 13.\n\nx_4 = 2*x_3 + 3 = 2*(4*x_1 + 9) + 3 = 8*x_1 + 18 + 3 = 8*1 + 21 = 29.\n\nx_5 = 2*x_4 + 3 = 2*(8*x_1 + 21) + 3 = 16*x_1 + 42 + 3 = 16*1 + 45 = 61.\n\nx_6 = 2*x_5 + 3 = 2*(16*x_1 + 45) + 3 = 32*x_1 + 90 + 3 = 32*1 + 93 = 125.\n\nAgain, I get x_6 = 125.\n\nThis matches both my earlier calculations: the step-by-step iteration and the closed-form formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of generating functions to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define the generating function X(t) = sum_{n=1}^\u221e x_n t^n.\n\nGiven the recurrence x_n = 2x_(n-1) + 3 for n > 1, and x_1 = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by t^n and sum over n from 2 to infinity:\n\nsum_{n=2}^\u221e x_n t^n = 2 sum_{n=2}^\u221e x_(n-1) t^n + 3 sum_{n=2}^\u221e t^n.\n\nThe left side is X(t) - x_1 t = X(t) - t.\n\nThe right side:\n\n2 t sum_{n=2}^\u221e x_(n-1) t^{n-1} = 2 t (X(t) - x_1 t) = 2 t (X(t) - t).\n\nAnd sum_{n=2}^\u221e t^n = t^2 / (1 - t).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nX(t) - t = 2 t (X(t) - t) + 3 t^2 / (1 - t).\n\nNow, solve for X(t):\n\nX(t) - t = 2 t X(t) - 2 t^2 + 3 t^2 / (1 - t).\n\nBring all terms involving X(t) to one side:\n\nX(t) - 2 t X(t) = t + 2 t^2 - 3 t^2 / (1 - t).\n\nFactor X(t):\n\nX(t) (1 - 2 t) = t + 2 t^2 - 3 t^2 / (1 - t).\n\nNow, solve for X(t):\n\nX(t) = [t + 2 t^2 - 3 t^2 / (1 - t)] / (1 - 2 t).\n\nThis looks a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify it.\n\nFirst, combine the terms in the numerator:\n\nt + 2 t^2 - 3 t^2 / (1 - t) = [t (1 - t) + 2 t^2 (1 - t) - 3 t^2] / (1 - t).\n\nWait, that might not be the best way.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute a common denominator for the terms in the numerator.\n\nt + 2 t^2 - 3 t^2 / (1 - t) = [t (1 - t) + 2 t^2 (1 - t) - 3 t^2] / (1 - t).\n\nWait, actually:\n\nt + 2 t^2 - 3 t^2 / (1 - t) = [t (1 - t) + 2 t^2 (1 - t) - 3 t^2] / (1 - t).\n\nWait, no. That's not correct.\n\nActually, t + 2 t^2 - 3 t^2 / (1 - t) = [t (1 - t) + 2 t^2 (1 - t) - 3 t^2] / (1 - t).\n\nWait, no, that's still incorrect.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nThe common denominator is (1 - t), so:\n\nt (1 - t) / (1 - t) + 2 t^2 (1 - t) / (1 - t) - 3 t^2 / (1 - t).\n\nSo, [t (1 - t) + 2 t^2 (1 - t) - 3 t^2] / (1 - t).\n\nNow, expand the numerator:\n\nt - t^2 + 2 t^2 - 2 t^3 - 3 t^2 = t - t^2 + 2 t^2 - 3 t^2 - 2 t^3 = t - 2 t^2 - 2 t^3.\n\nSo, X(t) = [t - 2 t^2 - 2 t^3] / [(1 - t)(1 - 2 t)].\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try partial fractions or another method to extract the coefficients, but this might be overkill for just finding x_6.\n\nGiven that I already have the closed-form formula x_n = 2^(n+1) - 3, and I've verified it multiple times, I think it's safe to conclude that x_6 = 125.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find x_6 directly without finding the general formula.\n\nLet's see, the recurrence is x_n = 2 x_(n-1) + 3.\n\nI can represent this recurrence in matrix form or use other methods, but that might be more time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can observe the pattern in the differences.\n\nLooking back at the terms:\n\nx_1 = 1\n\nx_2 = 5 (difference of 4)\n\nx_3 = 13 (difference of 8)\n\nx_4 = 29 (difference of 16)\n\nx_5 = 61 (difference of 32)\n\nx_6 = 125 (difference of 64)\n\nI see that the differences are powers of 2: 4=2^2, 8=2^3, 16=2^4, 32=2^5, 64=2^6.\n\nSo, the difference between consecutive terms is x_n - x_(n-1) = 2^n.\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence, x_n - x_(n-1) = 2 x_(n-1) + 3 - x_(n-1) = x_(n-1) + 3.\n\nBut according to my differences, it's 2^n.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile these two expressions for the difference.\n\nSo, from the recurrence: x_n - x_(n-1) = x_(n-1) + 3.\n\nBut according to the observed differences: x_n - x_(n-1) = 2^n.\n\nSo, setting them equal: x_(n-1) + 3 = 2^n.\n\nTherefore, x_(n-1) = 2^n - 3.\n\nBut that would imply x_n = 2^(n+1) - 3, which matches the general formula I found earlier.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nThus, x_6 = 125.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of solving linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\n\nI already did that earlier, finding the homogeneous solution and particular solution, and then combining them with the initial condition.\n\nGiven that I've arrived at the same answer through multiple methods, I'm confident that x_6 = 125 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of x_6 is 125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
