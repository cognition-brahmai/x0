        "content": "Let's see. The train travels from Town A to Town B, which is 120 miles apart. It leaves at 2 PM and arrives at 5 PM. So, the total travel time is 3 hours for 120 miles. That means the train's speed is constant.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the speed of the train. Speed is distance divided by time, right? So, speed = 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the time when the train has traveled half the distance. Half of 120 miles is 60 miles.\n\nSo, time taken to travel 60 miles at 40 miles per hour would be time = distance / speed = 60 miles / 40 mph = 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, the train starts at 2 PM, and after 1.5 hours, it would be at half the distance.\n\nLet me calculate 1.5 hours from 2 PM. 1 hour would bring us to 3 PM, and another 0.5 hour is 30 minutes, so 3 PM + 30 minutes = 3:30 PM.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, since the train travels at a constant speed, it covers equal distances in equal intervals of time.\n\nTotal time is 3 hours for 120 miles. So, every hour, it should cover 40 miles.\n\nAt 2 PM, it starts.\n\nAt 3 PM, it should have covered 40 miles.\n\nAt 4 PM, 80 miles.\n\nAt 5 PM, 120 miles.\n\nBut we need to know when it has covered 60 miles.\n\nSo, from 2 PM to 3 PM, it covers 40 miles.\n\nThen from 3 PM to 4 PM, another 40 miles, totaling 80 miles.\n\nSo, 60 miles would be halfway between 3 PM and 4 PM.\n\nSince it covers 40 miles in one hour, to cover 20 miles more (from 40 to 60 miles), it would take 20 miles / 40 mph = 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes.\n\nSo, 3 PM + 30 minutes = 3:30 PM.\n\nWait, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of proportion.\n\nThe train covers 120 miles in 3 hours. So, for 60 miles, which is half the distance, it should take half the time, which is 1.5 hours.\n\nStarting at 2 PM, plus 1.5 hours, again 3:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for constant speed: distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nWe know speed is 40 mph.\n\nSo, time = distance / speed = 60 miles / 40 mph = 1.5 hours.\n\nAgain, 2 PM + 1.5 hours = 3:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the train's position at different times.\n\nAt 2 PM, position 0 miles.\n\nAt 3 PM, 40 miles.\n\nAt 4 PM, 80 miles.\n\nAt 5 PM, 120 miles.\n\nSo, to be at 60 miles, it would be at 3:30 PM.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the train is moving at a constant speed, perhaps it's accelerating or something. But the problem says constant speed, so no acceleration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Like, perhaps the train stops halfway and waits for some time. But the problem doesn't mention any stops, so I assume it's a non-stop journey at constant speed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the time zone changes between Town A and Town B, but that seems unlikely, and the problem doesn't mention anything about time zones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the train doesn't travel in a straight line, but again, the problem states it's between two towns 120 miles apart, so I think it's safe to assume a direct distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed isn't constant, but the problem specifically says it travels at a constant speed, so I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the time when the train has traveled half the distance is 3:30 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:30 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
