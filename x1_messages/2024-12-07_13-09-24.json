The expression is:\n\n((7 - 3)^2 + (9 / 3) - 1) * 4 - 5\n\nFirst, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with (7 - 3), that's 4.\n\nSo, (4)^2 is 16.\n\nNext, (9 / 3) is 3.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n(16 + 3 - 1) * 4 - 5\n\nInside the parentheses:\n\n16 + 3 is 19, minus 1 is 18.\n\nSo, 18 * 4 is 72.\n\nFinally, 72 - 5 is 67.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 67."
