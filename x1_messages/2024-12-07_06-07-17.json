One day, while exploring, they stumbled upon a trapped baby bird. Elara, with her gentle strength, carefully broke the branches around the bird, while Milo, using his small size, reached into the nest to comfort the frightened chick. Together, they freed the bird and watched it fly back to its family. The jungle echoed with gratitude, and Elara and Milo continued their adventures, proving that friendship knows no bounds, even between the largest elephant and the smallest mouse."
