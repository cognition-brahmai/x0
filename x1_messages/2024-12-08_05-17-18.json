        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units every day, and 2% of them are defective. We need to find out how many defective units are made in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in a week. Since they make 500 units per day, I can multiply that by 7 to get the weekly production.\n\n500 units/day \u00d7 7 days = 3500 units\n\nSo, in a week, they produce 3500 units.\n\nNow, with a defect rate of 2%, I need to find out how many of these 3500 units are defective.\n\nTo find 2% of 3500, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply.\n\n2% = 0.02\n\nSo, 0.02 \u00d7 3500 = 70\n\nTherefore, there will be 70 defective units produced in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, daily production is 500 units.\n\nWeekly production is 500 \u00d7 7 = 3500 units.\n\nDefect rate is 2%, which is 0.02 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 0.02 \u00d7 3500 = 70.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of defective units per day and then multiply by 7.\n\nDefective units per day: 2% of 500.\n\n0.02 \u00d7 500 = 10 units per day.\n\nThen, in a week: 10 units/day \u00d7 7 days = 70 units.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the number of defective units produced in a week is 70.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
