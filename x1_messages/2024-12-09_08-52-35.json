        "content": "Let's see. So, the person is walking at an average speed of 3.5 miles per hour for a total time of 2 hours and 45 minutes. I need to find out how many miles they would travel.\n\nFirst, I should convert the time into hours because the speed is in miles per hour. 2 hours is already in hours, but 45 minutes needs to be converted. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 hours. Let me calculate that:\n\n45 \u00f7 60 = 0.75 hours\n\nSo, total time in hours is 2 + 0.75 = 2.75 hours.\n\nNow, to find the distance, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 3.5 mph \u00d7 2.75 hours\n\nLet me multiply that:\n\n3.5 \u00d7 2.75\n\nI can break it down:\n\n3.5 \u00d7 2 = 7\n\n3.5 \u00d7 0.75 = 2.625\n\nNow, add them together: 7 + 2.625 = 9.625 miles\n\nSo, the person would travel 9.625 miles.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since speed is distance over time, distance is speed multiplied by time. I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 45 minutes, total 165 minutes.\n\nSpeed is 3.5 miles per 60 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).\n\nSo, in 1 minute, the person walks 3.5 / 60 miles.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n3.5 \u00f7 60 = 0.058333... miles per minute\n\nNow, in 165 minutes, the distance would be:\n\n0.058333... \u00d7 165\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.058333 \u00d7 165 \u2248 9.625 miles\n\nSame result as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use fractions to avoid decimals.\n\n3.5 miles per hour is the same as 7/2 miles per hour.\n\nTime is 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 2 + 45/60 hours.\n\n45/60 simplifies to 3/4, so time is 2 + 3/4 = 11/4 hours.\n\nNow, distance = speed \u00d7 time = (7/2) \u00d7 (11/4) = 77/8 miles.\n\n77 divided by 8 is 9.625 miles.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 9.625 miles.\n\nTherefore, the person would travel 9.625 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9.625} \\]"
