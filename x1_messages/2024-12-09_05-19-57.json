        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a cube with a volume of 27 cubic meters, and we're told that each side of the cube is tripled. We need to find the new volume.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cube. I know that the volume \\( V \\) of a cube with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ V = s^3 \\]\n\nGiven that the original volume is 27 cubic meters, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ s^3 = 27 \\]\n\nTo find the original side length \\( s \\), I take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow, if each side is tripled, the new side length \\( s' \\) will be:\n\n\\[ s' = 3 \\times s = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTo find the new volume \\( V' \\), I use the volume formula again with the new side length:\n\n\\[ V' = (s')^3 = 9^3 = 729 \\text{ cubic meters} \\]\n\nThat seems straightforward. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I know that when you scale the sides of a three-dimensional object by a factor, the volume scales by the cube of that factor. In this case, the scaling factor is 3.\n\nSo, the new volume should be:\n\n\\[ V' = 3^3 \\times V = 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\text{ cubic meters} \\]\n\nWait, no. That doesn't make sense. \\( 3^3 = 27 \\), and multiplying that by the original volume \\( V = 27 \\) would give \\( 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\), which matches my previous calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I scale each side by 3, the volume should increase by \\( 3^3 = 27 \\) times the original volume.\n\nSo, \\( V' = 27 \\times V = 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\) cubic meters.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of the new volume to the original volume. Since each side is tripled, the volume should increase by a factor of \\( 3^3 = 27 \\).\n\nTherefore, the new volume is 27 times the original volume, which is \\( 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\) cubic meters.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything special about the cube that I should consider? A cube has equal sides, so scaling all sides equally should uniformly scale the volume by the cube of the scaling factor.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the surface area or something else, but the question is only asking for the new volume after tripling each side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the relationship between the side length and the volume. Since volume is proportional to the cube of the side length, tripling the side length should increase the volume by a factor of 27.\n\nSo, again, \\( V' = 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\) cubic meters.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If the original cube has sides of 3 meters, then tripling that would make each side 9 meters. The volume would be \\( 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729 \\) cubic meters.\n\nIs there a chance that the scaling factor applies differently? For example, in two dimensions, if you double the side of a square, the area quadruples because area scales with the square of the side length. Similarly, in three dimensions, volume scales with the cube of the side length.\n\nSo, scaling by a factor of 3 should increase the volume by \\( 3^3 = 27 \\) times.\n\nTherefore, the new volume is \\( 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\) cubic meters.\n\nWait a minute, I keep getting 729, but maybe I should consider if the \"tripling\" refers to the surface area or something else. No, the problem clearly states that the length of each side is tripled.\n\nLet me consider if there's a misunderstanding of the term \"triple.\" Does it mean multiplied by three or increased by three times? In this context, tripling the side length means multiplying the side length by three, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone might misinterpret \"triple\" as adding three times the original side, but that would mean the new side length is \\( s + 3s = 4s \\), which is not the case here.\n\nThe problem says \"each side is tripled,\" which unambiguously means multiplying by three.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial calculation, the new volume is 729 cubic meters.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other mathematical perspective I can look at this from. For instance, using proportions or similar figures.\n\nIf two cubes have side lengths in the ratio \\( a:b \\), their volumes are in the ratio \\( a^3:b^3 \\).\n\nIn this case, the side length ratio is \\( 3:1 \\), so the volume ratio is \\( 27:1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the new volume is 27 times the original volume, which is again 729 cubic meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for volume scaling.\n\nIf the scaling factor for length is \\( k \\), then the scaling factor for volume is \\( k^3 \\).\n\nHere, \\( k = 3 \\), so the volume scaling factor is \\( 27 \\).\n\nThus, \\( V' = 27 \\times V = 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\) cubic meters.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles, and consistently, I arrive at the same answer: 729 cubic meters.\n\nIs there any possibility that the original cube has a different side length? Wait, the volume is given as 27 cubic meters, so the side length must be 3 meters, since \\( 3^3 = 27 \\).\n\nThere's no ambiguity there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if the cube was made of smaller cubes or something like that, but the problem doesn't mention any such complexity.\n\nTherefore, I am confident that the new volume is 729 cubic meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{729} \\]"
