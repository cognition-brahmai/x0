        "content": "Let's tackle this algebra problem step by step. So, we have the expression (3x^2 - 5x + 2) divided by (x - 1), and we need to simplify it.\n\nFirst off, when you see a polynomial divided by a binomial, one common method to simplify it is through polynomial long division. Another method is factoring, if possible. Let's see if we can factor the numerator.\n\nThe numerator is 3x^2 - 5x + 2. We're going to try to factor this quadratic expression. To factor 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we need to find two binomials that multiply to give this quadratic.\n\nLet's look for two numbers that multiply to 3*2 = 6 and add up to -5. Hmm, what could they be? Let's think about the factors of 6 that add up to -5. The pairs of factors of 6 are (1,6), (2,3), (-1,-6), (-2,-3). Among these, (-2) and (-3) add up to -5.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the middle term -5x as -3x - 2x. Let's try that:\n\n3x^2 - 3x - 2x + 2\n\nNow, group the terms:\n\n(3x^2 - 3x) + (-2x + 2)\n\nFactor out the common factors in each group:\n\n3x(x - 1) - 2(x - 1)\n\nNow, notice that (x - 1) is a common factor in both terms. So, we can factor that out:\n\n(3x - 2)(x - 1)\n\nGreat! So, the numerator 3x^2 - 5x + 2 factors into (3x - 2)(x - 1).\n\nNow, let's look back at the original expression:\n\n(3x^2 - 5x + 2) / (x - 1)\n\nSince we factored the numerator as (3x - 2)(x - 1), we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n(3x - 2)(x - 1) / (x - 1)\n\nNow, as long as x \u2260 1 (because division by zero is undefined), we can cancel the (x - 1) terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n3x - 2\n\nTherefore, (3x^2 - 5x + 2) / (x - 1) simplifies to 3x - 2, provided x \u2260 1.\n\nLet me just double-check this to make sure. If I plug in a value for x, say x = 2, into both the original expression and the simplified expression, they should give the same result.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(3(2)^2 - 5(2) + 2) / (2 - 1) = (12 - 10 + 2) / 1 = 4 / 1 = 4\n\nSimplified expression:\n\n3(2) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4\n\nLooks good! And if I choose x = 0:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(3(0)^2 - 5(0) + 2) / (0 - 1) = (0 - 0 + 2) / (-1) = 2 / (-1) = -2\n\nSimplified expression:\n\n3(0) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2\n\nPerfect, they match.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3x - 2, with the condition that x \u2260 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3x - 2 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad x \\neq 1} \\]"
