Here it is:\n\nSilent stars shimmering above,\n\nSoftly singing songs of love.\n\nSerene skies stretch wide and blue,\n\nSheltering us, me and you.\n\nSecret whispers in the breeze,\n\nSweet nothings, gentle and kind.\n\nSunsets paint the heavens red,\n\nSymbolizing endings, yet beginnings ahead.\n\nSo here's to life, so full of grace,\n\nIn every moment, find your place.\n\nStay true to who you are inside,\n\nAnd let your spirit fly, with pride."
