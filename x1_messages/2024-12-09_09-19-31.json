        "content": "The astronomer credited with formulating a model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than Earth at the center is Nicolaus Copernicus. This model is known as the heliocentric model, which was a revolutionary idea during his time as it challenged the long-held geocentric model that placed Earth at the center of the universe.\n\nNicolaus Copernicus developed his heliocentric theory in the 16th century, although he delayed publishing his work, \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), until just before his death in 1543. His model proposed that the planets, including Earth, orbit the Sun, and that the Earth itself rotates on its axis, explaining the observed movements of the heavens.\n\nGalileo Galilei, another important figure in astronomy, later provided observational evidence supporting the heliocentric model through his telescopic observations, including the phases of Venus and the moons of Jupiter. Johannes Kepler built upon Copernicus's work and formulated the laws of planetary motion, describing the orbits of planets as ellipses rather than perfect circles. Isaac Newton, in the 17th century, explained the underlying physical laws, including the law of universal gravitation, which mathematically described the forces governing the motions of celestial bodies.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Nicolaus Copernicus."
