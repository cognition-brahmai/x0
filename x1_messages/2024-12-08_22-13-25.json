        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field that's 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. The farmer wants to divide this field into square plots that are all the same size, and he wants these squares to be as large as possible. Our job is to figure out what the side length of each square plot should be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to divide the field into square plots. Since the plots are square, that means each plot has the same length and width. So, if the side length of each square plot is 's' meters, then both the length and the width of the field must be divisible by 's' without any remainder. Otherwise, the plots won't fit perfectly into the field.\n\nSo, the side length 's' has to be a divisor of both 120 meters and 80 meters. But the farmer wants the largest possible square plots, which means 's' should be as large as possible. Therefore, I need to find the largest number that divides both 120 and 80 without leaving a remainder.\n\nIn mathematics, that's known as the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them exactly. So, in this case, finding the GCD of 120 and 80 will give me the largest possible side length for the square plots.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One common method is to list all the divisors of each number and then identify the greatest number that appears in both lists.\n\nFirst, I'll list the divisors of 120.\n\nTo find the divisors of 120, I can list all the numbers that divide 120 without leaving a remainder.\n\n1. 1 (since 1 divides every number)\n\n2. 2 (120 \u00f7 2 = 60)\n\n3. 3 (120 \u00f7 3 = 40)\n\n4. 4 (120 \u00f7 4 = 30)\n\n5. 5 (120 \u00f7 5 = 24)\n\n6. 6 (120 \u00f7 6 = 20)\n\n7. 8 (120 \u00f7 8 = 15)\n\n8. 10 (120 \u00f7 10 = 12)\n\n9. 12 (120 \u00f7 12 = 10)\n\n10. 15 (120 \u00f7 15 = 8)\n\n11. 20 (120 \u00f7 20 = 6)\n\n12. 24 (120 \u00f7 24 = 5)\n\n13. 30 (120 \u00f7 30 = 4)\n\n14. 40 (120 \u00f7 40 = 3)\n\n15. 60 (120 \u00f7 60 = 2)\n\n16. 120 (120 \u00f7 120 = 1)\n\nSo, the divisors of 120 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nNext, I'll list the divisors of 80.\n\n1. 1 (since 1 divides every number)\n\n2. 2 (80 \u00f7 2 = 40)\n\n3. 4 (80 \u00f7 4 = 20)\n\n4. 5 (80 \u00f7 5 = 16)\n\n5. 8 (80 \u00f7 8 = 10)\n\n6. 10 (80 \u00f7 10 = 8)\n\n7. 16 (80 \u00f7 16 = 5)\n\n8. 20 (80 \u00f7 20 = 4)\n\n9. 40 (80 \u00f7 40 = 2)\n\n10. 80 (80 \u00f7 80 = 1)\n\nSo, the divisors of 80 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, 80.\n\nNow, I need to find the common divisors of both 120 and 80. Looking at both lists, the common divisors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nAmong these, the greatest one is 40. Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 120 and 80 is 40.\n\nSo, the largest possible side length for the square plots is 40 meters.\n\nBut let me double-check this to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way to find the GCD is to use the prime factorization method. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of 120.\n\n120 can be divided by 2: 120 \u00f7 2 = 60\n\n60 \u00f7 2 = 30\n\n30 \u00f7 2 = 15\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factors of 120 are: 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5, or 2^3 \u00d7 3^1 \u00d7 5^1.\n\nNext, find the prime factors of 80.\n\n80 \u00f7 2 = 40\n\n40 \u00f7 2 = 20\n\n20 \u00f7 2 = 10\n\n10 \u00f7 2 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factors of 80 are: 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5, or 2^4 \u00d7 5^1.\n\nNow, the GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors.\n\nThe common prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nThe lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is 2^3 (since 2^3 is in 120 and 2^4 is in 80, so take 2^3).\n\nThe lowest power of 5 in both is 5^1.\n\nSo, GCD = 2^3 \u00d7 5^1 = 8 \u00d7 5 = 40.\n\nThis matches the earlier result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any larger number that could divide both 120 and 80.\n\nLooking at the lists, 40 is indeed the largest number that appears in both lists of divisors.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider 40 meters as the side length, let's see how many square plots that would create.\n\nThe length of the field is 120 meters, so 120 \u00f7 40 = 3 plots along the length.\n\nThe width is 80 meters, so 80 \u00f7 40 = 2 plots along the width.\n\nTherefore, the field would be divided into 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 square plots, each of 40 meters by 40 meters.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nYes, because 40 meters divides both 120 meters (3 times) and 80 meters (2 times) without any remainder.\n\nIs there a larger number that could do this? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we try 50 meters.\n\n120 \u00f7 50 = 2.4, which is not an integer, meaning there would be a remainder, and the plots wouldn't fit perfectly.\n\n80 \u00f7 50 = 1.6, again not an integer, with a remainder.\n\nSo, 50 meters is too large.\n\nWhat about 40 meters?\n\n120 \u00f7 40 = 3, which is an integer.\n\n80 \u00f7 40 = 2, which is also an integer.\n\nPerfect, no remainder.\n\nWhat if we try 40 meters?\n\nWait, I already did that. It works.\n\nWhat about 45 meters?\n\n120 \u00f7 45 = 2.666..., not an integer.\n\n80 \u00f7 45 = 1.777..., again not an integer.\n\nSo, 45 meters doesn't work.\n\nHow about 40 meters again? We already confirmed it works.\n\nIs there any number between 40 and 50 that could work?\n\nSay, 42 meters.\n\n120 \u00f7 42 \u2248 2.857, not an integer.\n\n80 \u00f7 42 \u2248 1.905, not an integer.\n\nNot possible.\n\nWhat about 48 meters?\n\n120 \u00f7 48 = 2.5, not an integer.\n\n80 \u00f7 48 \u2248 1.666, not an integer.\n\nNo good.\n\nSo, indeed, 40 meters is the largest possible side length for the square plots that divides both the length and the width without leaving a remainder.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 40 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
