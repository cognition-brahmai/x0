        "content": "So the company has 150 employees right now, and they want to increase their workforce by 20%. You want to know how many new employees that would mean they're going to hire.\n\nFirst, you need to understand what a 20% increase means. Percentage increase is a way to express how much something grows in relation to its original amount. So, 20% of the current number of employees will be the number of new hires.\n\nTo calculate 20% of 150, you can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply it by the original number. Remember, 20% is the same as 20 per 100, which is 0.20 in decimal form.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nNumber of new employees = 20% of 150 = 0.20 \u00d7 150\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n0.20 \u00d7 150 = 30\n\nSo, the company plans to hire 30 new employees.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with percentages.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find what 20% of 150 is. You can also think of it as (20/100) \u00d7 150.\n\nSo, (20/100) \u00d7 150 = (1/5) \u00d7 150 = 30\n\nYes, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if you wanted to find the total number of employees after the increase, you would add the new hires to the original number.\n\nTotal employees after increase = original employees + new employees = 150 + 30 = 180\n\nAlternatively, you can calculate the total directly by multiplying the original number by (1 + percentage increase).\n\nSo, total employees = 150 \u00d7 (1 + 0.20) = 150 \u00d7 1.20 = 180\n\nThen, the number of new employees would be the difference between the total and the original, which is 180 - 150 = 30\n\nAgain, that confirms that the company will hire 30 new employees.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the percentage was applied differently. For example, if the 20% increase was based on the current workforce plus the new hires, but that would be a different scenario, like a compounding increase, which isn't the case here.\n\nIn this problem, the increase is straightforward: 20% of the current number of employees.\n\nSo, the answer is 30 new employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
