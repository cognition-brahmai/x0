        "content": "So there are 25 students in a class, and each has a different number of pencils ranging from 1 to 25. I need to find the probability that if I pick two students at random, both have an even number of pencils.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students have an even number of pencils. The numbers range from 1 to 25, so I need to count the even numbers in that range.\n\nEven numbers are divisible by 2. So, starting from 2, 4, 6, up to 24. Let's see, 24 is the largest even number less than or equal to 25.\n\nTo find the count of even numbers between 1 and 25, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:\n\nNumber of terms = (Last term - First term)/Common difference + 1\n\nHere, First term = 2, Last term = 24, Common difference = 2\n\nSo, number of even numbers = (24 - 2)/2 + 1 = (22)/2 + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12\n\nWait, but let's check manually: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24. Yep, 12 even numbers.\n\nSo, there are 12 students with even numbers of pencils.\n\nTotal students are 25.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that both selected students have even numbers of pencils.\n\nSince the selection is random and without replacement (I think), the probability would be:\n\n(Pick one student with even pencils) * (Pick another student with even pencils given that one has already been picked)\n\nSo, first pick: 12 out of 25 have even pencils. So, probability is 12/25.\n\nSecond pick: Now, there are 11 students left with even pencils, and total students left are 24.\n\nSo, probability of second pick is 11/24.\n\nTherefore, total probability is (12/25) * (11/24)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 12/25 = 0.48\n\nThen, 11/24 \u2248 0.4583\n\nMultiply them: 0.48 * 0.4583 \u2248 0.219984\n\nSo, approximately 0.22, or 22%.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it as a fraction.\n\nSo, (12/25) * (11/24) = (12*11)/(25*24) = 132 / 600\n\nSimplify that: both divisible by 12.\n\n132 \u00f7 12 = 11\n\n600 \u00f7 12 = 50\n\nSo, 11/50.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 11/50, which is 22%.\n\nWait, but 11/50 is actually 0.22, so yes, 22%.\n\nSo, the probability is 11/50 or 22%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{50}} \\]"
