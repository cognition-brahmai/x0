        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving Town A heading towards Town B at 80 km/h, and the other leaving Town B heading towards Town A at 100 km/h. The distance between the two towns is 360 km. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet each other.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nRelative speed = Speed of train from A + Speed of train from B\n                = 80 km/h + 100 km/h\n                = 180 km/h\n\nNow, the total distance between the two towns is 360 km. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 360 km / 180 km/h\n      = 2 hours\n\nSo, it should take 2 hours for the two trains to meet each other.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe I can approach the problem differently to confirm my answer.\n\nLet's consider the distance each train covers in time t hours.\n\nDistance covered by train from A in time t: 80t km\nDistance covered by train from B in time t: 100t km\n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should equal the total distance between the towns.\n\nSo,\n\n80t + 100t = 360\n180t = 360\nt = 360 / 180\nt = 2 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of relative speed again. The relative speed is 180 km/h, and the distance is 360 km, so time is 2 hours.\n\nI think this makes sense. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\nAnother way to think about it: suppose I consider the position of both trains at any given time t. The train from A has traveled 80t km, and the train from B has traveled 100t km. When they meet, the sum of these distances should be equal to the initial distance between the towns, which is 360 km. So, 80t + 100t = 360, which again gives t = 2 hours.\n\nI could also consider the time from the perspective of one train only. For example, from the perspective of the train from A, the train from B is approaching it at a speed of 100 km/h + 80 km/h = 180 km/h. So, the train from B is closing the gap at 180 km/h. With a initial gap of 360 km, the time to close the gap is 360 / 180 = 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, from the perspective of the train from B, the train from A is approaching at 180 km/h, and the distance is 360 km, so time is again 2 hours.\n\nIt seems consistent no matter how I look at it.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the speeds were different. Suppose train A is going at 70 km/h and train B at 110 km/h, with the same 360 km distance.\n\nRelative speed = 70 + 110 = 180 km/h\nTime = 360 / 180 = 2 hours\n\nWait, that's the same time as before. Is that right? Let me calculate again.\n\nIf train A is at 70 km/h and train B at 110 km/h, relative speed is 180 km/h, and distance is 360 km, so time is 2 hours. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut in the original problem, with 80 km/h and 100 km/h, relative speed is still 180 km/h, so time is still 2 hours.\n\nI guess in this specific case, as long as the sum of their speeds is 180 km/h, the time will be 2 hours.\n\nBut in general, time = distance / relative speed.\n\nIn this problem, since the relative speed is the sum of their speeds because they are moving towards each other, the calculation holds.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently from multiple angles. It seems clear that the trains will meet after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
