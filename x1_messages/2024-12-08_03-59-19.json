        "content": "So, there are houses on both sides of the street\u201410 on one side and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. Each house has a unique color, but that doesn't really affect how many times they get painted, right? The key point is that each house owner can only paint their house once every year.\n\nSo, if each house can be painted once per year, and we're looking at a period of 3 years, then each house will be painted 3 times, one each year.\n\nSince there are 25 houses, and each is painted 3 times over 3 years, the total number of paintings would be 25 houses multiplied by 3 paintings per house.\n\nLet me just write that down:\n\nTotal paintings = number of houses \u00d7 paintings per house per year \u00d7 number of years\n\nBut since paintings per house per year is 1, and number of years is 3, it simplifies to:\n\nTotal paintings = 25 houses \u00d7 3 = 75 paintings\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check that. If each house is painted once every year, and there are 3 years, then indeed, each house is painted 3 times. So, 25 houses times 3 paintings each equals 75 paintings in total.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here, as the problem seems straightforward. The unique color thing might just be to say that each house is distinct, so no two houses have the same color, but that doesn't impact the painting frequency.\n\nSo, my final answer is 75 paintings after 3 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
