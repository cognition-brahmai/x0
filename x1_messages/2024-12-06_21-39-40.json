It covers approximately 63 million square miles (163 million square kilometers), which is about 46% of the Earth's water surface and more than twice the area of the next largest ocean, the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean is not only vast in area but also contains the deepest point on Earth, known as the Challenger Deep, located in the Mariana Trench near the island of Guam. The depth of the Challenger Deep is estimated to be around 36,070 feet (10,994 meters) below sea level.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean plays a crucial role in global climate patterns and is home to a diverse array of marine life. It is bordered by the continents of Asia, Australia, North and South America, and numerous islands.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n- **Area:** Approximately 63 million square miles (163 million square kilometers)\n\n- **Deepest Point:** Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, about 36,070 feet (10,994 meters) deep\n\n- **Bordering Continents:** Asia, Australia, North and South America\n\n- **Significance:** Plays a key role in global climate and hosts diverse marine ecosystems"
