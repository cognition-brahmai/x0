        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students. Out of these, 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 22 play volleyball. Additionally, 6 students don't play any sport. We need to find out how many students play all three sports.\n\nFirst, I think it's important to figure out how many students actually play at least one sport. Since there are 30 students in total and 6 don't play any sport, that means 30 - 6 = 24 students play at least one sport.\n\nNow, let's consider the numbers given for each sport:\n\n- Soccer: 18 students\n\n- Basketball: 20 students\n\n- Volleyball: 22 students\n\nIf we add these up, we get 18 + 20 + 22 = 60. However, this total counts students who play multiple sports multiple times. For example, a student who plays both soccer and basketball would be counted in both the soccer and basketball groups, so they are counted twice in this total.\n\nSimilarly, a student who plays all three sports would be counted three times in this total.\n\nSince we know that only 24 students play at least one sport, but the total of 60 suggests that there is a lot of overlap because 60 is greater than 24.\n\nTo find out the overlap, I think we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets is given by:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC\n\nWhere:\n\n- Total is the number of students playing at least one sport.\n\n- A, B, C are the number of students playing each individual sport.\n\n- AB, AC, BC are the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\n- ABC is the number of students playing all three sports.\n\nWait a minute, in the inclusion-exclusion principle, the formula is actually:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC\n\nBut in some versions, AB, AC, BC represent the number of students playing both sports, which includes those who play all three sports as well. So, perhaps I need to clarify that.\n\nActually, to avoid confusion, let's define:\n\n- n(A) = number of students playing soccer = 18\n\n- n(B) = number of students playing basketball = 20\n\n- n(C) = number of students playing volleyball = 22\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) = number of students playing both soccer and basketball\n\n- n(A \u2229 C) = number of students playing both soccer and volleyball\n\n- n(B \u2229 C) = number of students playing both basketball and volleyball\n\n- n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = number of students playing all three sports\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states:\n\nn(A \u222a B \u222a C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nWe know that n(A \u222a B \u222a C) = 24, since 24 students play at least one sport.\n\nSo, plugging in the values we have:\n\n24 = 18 + 20 + 22 - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n18 + 20 + 22 = 60\n\nSo,\n\n24 = 60 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nNow, we need to find n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C), but we have one equation with two unknowns: the sum of the pairwise intersections and the triple intersection.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky because we don't have information about how many students play exactly two sports. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nWait, perhaps we can consider the total number of sport participations. If we add up the number of students in each sport, we get 60, but this counts students playing multiple sports multiple times. Specifically:\n\n- Students playing one sport are counted once.\n\n- Students playing two sports are counted twice.\n\n- Students playing three sports are counted three times.\n\nWe know that there are 24 students playing at least one sport. So, if we let:\n\n- x = number of students playing exactly one sport\n\n- y = number of students playing exactly two sports\n\n- z = number of students playing all three sports\n\nThen, we have:\n\nx + y + z = 24 (since 24 students play at least one sport)\n\nAlso, the total number of sport participations is:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 60 (since students playing two sports are counted twice, and those playing three sports are counted three times)\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) x + y + z = 24\n\n2) x + 2y + 3z = 60\n\nWe need a third equation to solve for x, y, and z. But we are only asked to find z, the number of students playing all three sports.\n\nIs there a way to eliminate x and y to solve for z directly?\n\nLet's subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x + 2y + 3z) - (x + y + z) = 60 - 24\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\ny + 2z = 36\n\nNow, we have:\n\ny + 2z = 36\n\nBut we still have two variables here. I need another equation to relate y and z.\n\nWait, maybe I can express y in terms of z from this equation:\n\ny = 36 - 2z\n\nNow, substitute this back into equation 1:\n\nx + (36 - 2z) + z = 24\n\nSimplify:\n\nx + 36 - z = 24\n\nTherefore:\n\nx = 24 - 36 + z\n\nx = z - 12\n\nBut x represents the number of students playing exactly one sport, which can't be negative. So, z - 12 \u2265 0 \u21d2 z \u2265 12\n\nBut z is the number of students playing all three sports, and we have only 24 students playing at least one sport. So, z cannot be more than 24.\n\nWait a minute, z \u2265 12, but z cannot exceed the number of students playing at least one sport, which is 24.\n\nBut let's think about the maximum possible z. The smallest group is soccer with 18 players, so z cannot be more than 18.\n\nSimilarly, basketball has 20, volleyball has 22.\n\nSo, z \u2264 18\n\nBut from x = z - 12, and x cannot be negative, so z \u2265 12\n\nTherefore, z is between 12 and 18.\n\nBut I need to find the exact value of z.\n\nMaybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet's consider the sum of the pairwise intersections.\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n24 = 18 + 20 + 22 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nSimplify:\n\n24 = 60 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nLet\u2019s denote n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C) as S\n\nSo:\n\n24 = 60 - S + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nTherefore:\n\nS - n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 60 - 24 = 36\n\nNow, we know that n(A \u2229 B), n(A \u2229 C), and n(B \u2229 C) each include n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nTo be precise:\n\nn(A \u2229 B) = number of students playing both soccer and basketball, which includes those who play all three sports.\n\nSimilarly for the other pairwise intersections.\n\nSo, if we let:\n\nn(A \u2229 B) = y_ab\n\nn(A \u2229 C) = y_ac\n\nn(B \u2229 C) = y_bc\n\nThen, S = y_ab + y_ac + y_bc\n\nBut each of y_ab, y_ac, y_bc includes z, the number of students playing all three sports.\n\nSo, y_ab = number playing soccer and basketball, including those who play volleyball.\n\nSimilarly, to find the number playing exactly two sports, we would have:\n\ny_ab - z = number playing exactly soccer and basketball, but not volleyball.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the total number of students playing at least one sport is 24, and the total number of sport participations is 60.\n\nFrom this, the sum of the pairwise intersections minus twice the triple intersection should give us the overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion again.\n\nWe have:\n\nn(A \u222a B \u222a C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n24 = 18 + 20 + 22 - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nSimplify:\n\n24 = 60 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nLet\u2019s denote n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C) as T\n\nSo:\n\n24 = 60 - T + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nTherefore:\n\nT - n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 36\n\nNow, we need to find n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C), but we have this relationship.\n\nIs there another equation involving T and n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find T in terms of other known quantities.\n\nWait, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of the pairwise intersections includes the triple intersection multiple times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT = n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C) = (number playing exactly two sports) + 3*n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nWait, no. Actually:\n\nn(A \u2229 B) = number playing soccer and basketball, which includes those who play all three sports.\n\nSo, n(A \u2229 B) = number playing exactly two sports (soccer and basketball only) plus n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nSimilarly for the other pairwise intersections.\n\nTherefore:\n\nT = (number playing exactly two sports: soccer and basketball only) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) + (number playing exactly two sports: soccer and volleyball only) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) + (number playing exactly two sports: basketball and volleyball only) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number playing exactly two sports as:\n\n- y_ab: exactly soccer and basketball\n\n- y_ac: exactly soccer and volleyball\n\n- y_bc: exactly basketball and volleyball\n\nThen:\n\nT = y_ab + y_ac + y_bc + 3*n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nBut we don\u2019t know y_ab, y_ac, y_bc.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the total number of sport participations again.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y + z = 24\n\nAnd\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 60\n\nWhere:\n\n- x: number playing exactly one sport\n\n- y: number playing exactly two sports\n\n- z: number playing all three sports\n\nFrom these two equations, we can solve for x and y in terms of z.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nx = 24 - y - z\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\n(24 - y - z) + 2y + 3z = 60\n\nSimplify:\n\n24 - y - z + 2y + 3z = 60\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n24 + y + 2z = 60\n\nTherefore:\n\ny + 2z = 36\n\nSo, y = 36 - 2z\n\nNow, since y represents the number of students playing exactly two sports, it must be non-negative:\n\ny \u2265 0 \u21d2 36 - 2z \u2265 0 \u21d2 z \u2264 18\n\nAlso, from x = 24 - y - z, and x \u2265 0:\n\n24 - (36 - 2z) - z \u2265 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n24 - 36 + 2z - z \u2265 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n-12 + z \u2265 0 \u21d2 z \u2265 12\n\nSo, z is between 12 and 18, inclusive.\n\nBut z is the number of students playing all three sports, and we have to find its exact value.\n\nPerhaps there is additional information we can use.\n\nWait, let's consider the maximum possible value for z.\n\nThe maximum number of students who can play all three sports is limited by the smallest group, which is soccer with 18 players.\n\nBut earlier, we have z \u2264 18 and z \u2265 12.\n\nSo, z can be 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18.\n\nBut we need to find the exact value.\n\nMaybe we can look at the totals again.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the number of students playing each sport:\n\n- Soccer: 18\n\n- Basketball: 20\n\n- Volleyball: 22\n\nIf z students play all three sports, then the number of students playing exactly soccer and basketball is y_ab = n(A \u2229 B) - z\n\nSimilarly, y_ac = n(A \u2229 C) - z\n\nAnd y_bc = n(B \u2229 C) - z\n\nNow, the total number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nx + y + z = 24\n\nWhere:\n\nx = number playing exactly one sport\n\ny = y_ab + y_ac + y_bc\n\nBut y_ab + y_ac + y_bc = (n(A \u2229 B) - z) + (n(A \u2229 C) - z) + (n(B \u2229 C) - z) = T - 3z\n\nWhere T = n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\nT - z = 36\n\nTherefore, T = 36 + z\n\nSo, y = T - 3z = 36 + z - 3z = 36 - 2z\n\nThis matches what we had earlier.\n\nNow, x = 24 - y - z = 24 - (36 - 2z) - z = 24 - 36 + 2z - z = -12 + z\n\nWe already established that x = z - 12, and x \u2265 0 implies z \u2265 12\n\nNow, let's think about the number of students playing exactly one sport.\n\nFor soccer:\n\nNumber playing only soccer = n(A) - y_ab - y_ac - z\n\nSimilarly for basketball and volleyball.\n\nBut this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the total number of students playing each sport in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nFor soccer:\n\nNumber playing only soccer: x_a\n\nNumber playing soccer and basketball only: y_ab\n\nNumber playing soccer and volleyball only: y_ac\n\nNumber playing all three: z\n\nSo, n(A) = x_a + y_ab + y_ac + z = 18\n\nSimilarly:\n\nn(B) = x_b + y_ab + y_bc + z = 20\n\nn(C) = x_c + y_ac + y_bc + z = 22\n\nWhere x_a + x_b + x_c = x (since x is the number playing exactly one sport)\n\nBut this seems to complicate things further.\n\nMaybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the total number of students is 30, with 6 not playing any sport, so 24 playing at least one sport.\n\nThe total number of sport participations is 60.\n\nIf we think about it, the average number of sports per student is 60 / 24 = 2.5\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the minimal number of students needed to account for all sport participations.\n\nIf all 24 students played exactly two sports, that would account for 48 participations, but we have 60 participations. So, there are 60 - 48 = 12 extra participations.\n\nThese extra participations must be accounted for by students playing all three sports.\n\nEach student playing all three sports is counted three times instead of twice, so each such student adds one extra participation.\n\nTherefore, the number of students playing all three sports is equal to the number of extra participations, which is 12.\n\nSo, z = 12\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf z = 12, then y = 36 - 2*12 = 12\n\nAnd x = z - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0\n\nWait, x = 0. That means no students are playing exactly one sport. Is that possible?\n\nLet\u2019s verify the numbers.\n\nIf z = 12, then:\n\n- Number playing all three sports: 12\n\n- Number playing exactly two sports: y = 12\n\n- Number playing exactly one sport: x = 0\n\nTotal students playing at least one sport: x + y + z = 0 + 12 + 12 = 24, which matches.\n\nNow, let's check the total number of sport participations.\n\nx*1 + y*2 + z*3 = 0*1 + 12*2 + 12*3 = 0 + 24 + 36 = 60, which also matches.\n\nFurthermore, let's check the number of students in each sport.\n\nFor soccer:\n\nNumber playing soccer = those playing only soccer + those playing soccer and basketball + soccer and volleyball + all three.\n\nBut x = 0, so:\n\nn(A) = y_ab + y_ac + z = 12 (since y = y_ab + y_ac = 12, and z = 12)\n\nWait, but y = 12 is the number playing exactly two sports, which is y_ab + y_ac + y_bc.\n\nBut in this case, since x = 0, and z = 12, then y_ab + y_ac + y_bc = 12.\n\nBut n(A) = y_ab + y_ac + z = y_ab + y_ac + 12 = 12, which would imply y_ab + y_ac = 0.\n\nBut then, y_bc must be 12.\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = y_ab + y_bc + z = 0 + 12 + 12 = 24, but n(B) is given as 20, which is a contradiction.\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, perhaps z = 12 is not correct.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the number of students playing at least one sport is 24.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n24 = 18 + 20 + 22 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nSimplify:\n\n24 = 60 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nLet\u2019s denote S = n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)\n\nThen:\n\n24 = 60 - S + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nTherefore:\n\nS - n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 36\n\nNow, we need another equation involving S and n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express S in terms of the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- p = number of students playing exactly two sports\n\n- q = number of students playing all three sports\n\nThen:\n\nS = p + 3q\n\nBecause each student playing exactly two sports is counted in two pairwise intersections, and those playing all three are counted in all three pairwise intersections.\n\nTherefore:\n\nS = p + 3q\n\nNow, from the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n24 = 18 + 20 + 22 - (p + 3q) + q\n\nSimplify:\n\n24 = 60 - p - 3q + q\n\n24 = 60 - p - 2q\n\nTherefore:\n\np + 2q = 36\n\nNow, we also know that the total number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nx + p + q = 24\n\nWhere x is the number playing exactly one sport.\n\nBut from earlier:\n\nx = 24 - p - q\n\nAlso, the total number of sport participations is:\n\nx + 2p + 3q = 60\n\nNow, substitute x = 24 - p - q into the participations equation:\n\n(24 - p - q) + 2p + 3q = 60\n\nSimplify:\n\n24 - p - q + 2p + 3q = 60\n\n24 + p + 2q = 60\n\nTherefore:\n\np + 2q = 36\n\nWait, this is the same equation we had earlier.\n\nSo, p + 2q = 36\n\nNow, we need another equation to solve for p and q.\n\nBut we only have one equation here. Maybe we can find another relationship.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the number of students playing each sport in terms of p and q.\n\nFor soccer:\n\nn(A) = x_a + p_ab + p_ac + q = 18\n\nWhere x_a is the number playing only soccer, p_ab is the number playing soccer and basketball only, p_ac is the number playing soccer and volleyball only.\n\nSimilarly for basketball and volleyball.\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the minimal and maximal values for q.\n\nFrom p + 2q = 36, and p \u2265 0, q \u2265 0.\n\nSo, q \u2264 18\n\nAlso, from x = 24 - p - q \u2265 0 \u21d2 p + q \u2264 24\n\nBut p + 2q = 36 \u21d2 p = 36 - 2q\n\nSubstitute into p + q \u2264 24:\n\n36 - 2q + q \u2264 24 \u21d2 36 - q \u2264 24 \u21d2 q \u2265 12\n\nSo, q \u2265 12 and q \u2264 18\n\nTherefore, q can be from 12 to 18.\n\nBut we need to find the exact value of q.\n\nMaybe we can check which value of q satisfies all conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s try q = 12\n\nThen p = 36 - 2*12 = 12\n\nAnd x = 24 - p - q = 24 - 12 - 12 = 0\n\nSo, x = 0, p = 12, q = 12\n\nNow, check if this fits the numbers for each sport.\n\nFor soccer:\n\nn(A) = x_a + p_ab + p_ac + q\n\nBut x = 0, so x_a = 0\n\nTherefore, n(A) = 0 + p_ab + p_ac + 12 = 18 \u21d2 p_ab + p_ac = 6\n\nSimilarly, for basketball:\n\nn(B) = x_b + p_ab + p_bc + q = 0 + p_ab + p_bc + 12 = 20 \u21d2 p_ab + p_bc = 8\n\nAnd for volleyball:\n\nn(C) = x_c + p_ac + p_bc + q = 0 + p_ac + p_bc + 12 = 22 \u21d2 p_ac + p_bc = 10\n\nNow, we have:\n\np_ab + p_ac = 6\n\np_ab + p_bc = 8\n\np_ac + p_bc = 10\n\nWe can solve this system of equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote p_ab = a, p_ac = b, p_bc = c\n\nThen:\n\na + b = 6\n\na + c = 8\n\nb + c = 10\n\nLet\u2019s subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(a + c) - (a + b) = 8 - 6 \u21d2 c - b = 2 \u21d2 c = b + 2\n\nNow, substitute into the third equation:\n\nb + (b + 2) = 10 \u21d2 2b + 2 = 10 \u21d2 2b = 8 \u21d2 b = 4\n\nThen, c = b + 2 = 6\n\nAnd from a + b = 6 \u21d2 a + 4 = 6 \u21d2 a = 2\n\nSo, p_ab = 2, p_ac = 4, p_bc = 6\n\nNow, check if these add up to p = 12\n\np = p_ab + p_ac + p_bc = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12, which matches.\n\nTherefore, q = 12 is a possible solution.\n\nBut earlier, when z = 12, we had n(B) = y_ab + y_bc + z = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20, which matches the given n(B) = 20.\n\nSimilarly, n(A) = 2 + 4 + 12 = 18, which matches.\n\nAnd n(C) = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22, which matches.\n\nAlso, the number of students playing at least one sport is x + p + q = 0 + 12 + 12 = 24, which matches.\n\nAnd the total number of sport participations is x*1 + p*2 + q*3 = 0*1 + 12*2 + 12*3 = 0 + 24 + 36 = 60, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the solution is consistent when q = 12.\n\nThus, the number of students playing all three sports is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
