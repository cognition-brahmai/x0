        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a group of 120 people, and currently, 75% of them are vaccinated. We need to find out how many more people need to get vaccinated to reach a 90% vaccination rate in the group.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many people are already vaccinated. Since 75% of 120 people are vaccinated, I can calculate that by multiplying 120 by 75% (or 0.75 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 120 * 0.75 = 90 people are already vaccinated.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many people would be vaccinated if the vaccination rate reached 90%. So, I'll calculate 90% of 120.\n\n120 * 0.90 = 108 people.\n\nNow, to find out how many more people need to be vaccinated to reach this 90% rate, I'll subtract the number of people already vaccinated from the number needed at 90%.\n\nSo, 108 - 90 = 18 people.\n\nTherefore, 18 more people need to be vaccinated to reach a 90% vaccination rate in the group.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 120 people, 75% vaccinated is 90 people. To reach 90% vaccination, which is 108 people, we need an additional 18 people to get vaccinated. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the difference in percentage points. The difference between 90% and 75% is 15%. So, 15% of 120 people should be the number of additional vaccinations needed.\n\nLet's calculate that: 120 * 0.15 = 18 people. Same answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also verify by adding the additional 18 vaccinated people to the current count: 90 + 18 = 108, which is indeed 90% of 120.\n\nSo, the answer is 18 more people need to be vaccinated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
