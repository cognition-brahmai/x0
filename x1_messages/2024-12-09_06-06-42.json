        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 apples in the basket to start with. If I take away 3 apples, that means I'm removing 3 from the original 10. So, 10 minus 3 is 7 apples left in the basket.\n\nThen, I put back 2 apples. That means I'm adding 2 apples back into the basket. So, 7 plus 2 equals 9 apples.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 apples left in the basket.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Starting with 10 apples, take away 3, that's 10 - 3 = 7. Then, put back 2, so 7 + 2 = 9. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as overall, I took away 3 and then added back 2, so net, I took away 1 apple. So, 10 minus 1 equals 9. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think 9 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
