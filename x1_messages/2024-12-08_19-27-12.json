        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a room with 10 people, and each person has the same number of friends as their age in years. Also, the total number of friendships in the room is 110. We need to find out how old the youngest person in the room is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. Each person's number of friends is equal to their age, and the total number of friendships is 110. Now, in terms of graph theory, this sounds like a graph where each person is a vertex, and each friendship is an edge connecting two vertices. So, the degree of each vertex (number of edges connected to it) is equal to the person's age.\n\nIn graph theory, the sum of all degrees in an undirected graph is equal to twice the number of edges. That's because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. So, if the total number of friendships (edges) is 110, then the sum of all degrees should be 2 * 110 = 220.\n\nGiven that each person's degree is equal to their age, the sum of all degrees is equal to the sum of all ages. Therefore, the sum of the ages of the 10 people is 220.\n\nSo, we have 10 people, each with an age equal to their number of friends, and the sum of their ages is 220. We need to find the age of the youngest person.\n\nBut there's a catch: in a group of people, the number of friends each person has is constrained by the number of other people in the group. Since there are 10 people, no one can have more friends than the number of other people, which is 9. So, the maximum age anyone can have is 9.\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. If the maximum age is 9, but the sum of ages is 220 for 10 people, that would mean the average age is 220 / 10 = 22. But if no one can be older than 9, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I've missed something.\n\nAh, maybe the friendships can extend outside the room as well. Maybe the 110 friendships include friendships with people outside the room, not just within the room. But the problem says \"each person has the same number of friends as their age in years,\" and it's in the context of a room with 10 people. It's a bit unclear.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"In a room, there are 10 people. Each person has the same number of friends as their age in years. The total number of friendships in the room is 110. How old is the youngest person in the room?\"\n\nI think the key here is to interpret what \"the total number of friendships in the room\" means. It probably means the total number of friendships among the 10 people in the room, excluding any friendships with people outside the room. However, if that's the case, then each friendship is a connection between two people in the room, so the total number of friendships should be equal to the number of edges in the graph formed by these 10 people.\n\nGiven that, the sum of all degrees (which is twice the number of edges) should be 2 * 110 = 220, as I thought earlier. But if each person's age is equal to their number of friends (degree), then the sum of their ages is 220. With 10 people, the average age is 22, but earlier I thought that the maximum age could be 9, which doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the ages are not constrained to be less than or equal to 9 if friendships can be with people outside the room. Maybe some people have friends outside the room, and their age reflects the total number of friends, including those outside the room.\n\nIf that's the case, then the sum of ages is 220 for 10 people, and we need to find the youngest age among them.\n\nBut the problem says \"each person has the same number of friends as their age in years,\" and it mentions \"the total number of friendships in the room is 110.\" So, it seems like it's considering only the friendships within the room.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the total number of friendships in the room\" refers to the number of pairs of friends in the room, which is 110, but that seems unlikely because with 10 people, the maximum number of friendships would be C(10,2) = 45 if everyone is friends with everyone else.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. If \"the total number of friendships in the room is 110,\" and each friendship is a connection between two people, then 110 seems too high for 10 people, since the maximum possible number of unique pairs is 45.\n\nMaybe the problem means that the sum of all friends that people have in the room is 110. In other words, the sum of each person's friends in the room is 110.\n\nBut wait, if each friendship is counted twice (once for each friend), then the sum of all friends should be twice the number of friendships.\n\nSo, if the total number of friendships is 110, then the sum of all friends would be 2 * 110 = 220, which matches the sum of ages.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the sum of ages is 220, and with 10 people, the average age is 22. So, perhaps some people have ages higher than 9, meaning they have friends outside the room.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for people to have more friends than just those in the room, and their age reflects their total number of friends, including those outside the room.\n\nIn that case, the sum of ages is 220, and we have 10 people with ages at least 0 (assuming age can be 0, meaning no friends in or out of the room).\n\nWe need to find the youngest age among them.\n\nBut without more constraints, the youngest age could be as low as 0, but perhaps the problem implies that everyone has at least one friend.\n\nHowever, to minimize the youngest age, we should maximize the ages of the other people.\n\nGiven that, let's assume that nine people have the maximum possible age, and the tenth has the remaining age to make the sum 220.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible age? If friendships can be with people outside the room, there's no upper limit on age.\n\nWait, but in the context of a graph, the degree of a vertex can't exceed the number of other vertices unless there are multiple edges or self-loops, which aren't mentioned.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about friendships being only within the room or including external friends, nor does it mention multiple friendships or self-friendships.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps we should assume that friendships are only within the room, meaning that each person's number of friends is at most 9 (the other people in the room).\n\nIf that's the case, then each age is between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nGiven that, we have 10 people, each with an age between 0 and 9, and the sum of their ages is 220.\n\nWait, but 10 * 9 = 90, which is far less than 220. So, there's a problem here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intends for ages to be higher than 9, meaning that people have friends outside the room as well.\n\nIn that case, ages can be any non-negative integer, and we need to find the youngest age given that the sum is 220.\n\nTo find the youngest possible age, we need to maximize the ages of the other nine people.\n\nIf nine people are as old as possible, then the tenth person will have the minimal age.\n\nBut what's the maximum age possible? If friendships can be with people outside the room, there's no theoretical upper limit.\n\nHowever, in graph theory, if we consider that each person can have any number of friends, including those outside the group, then ages can be any non-negative integer.\n\nSo, to minimize the youngest age, we maximize the ages of the other nine people.\n\nLet's assume that nine people have age A, and the tenth has age B, where B is the youngest.\n\nWe have 9A + B = 220.\n\nTo minimize B, we maximize A.\n\nBut A can be as large as we want, since there's no upper limit.\n\nTherefore, we can make A approaches infinity, and B approaches 220 - 9A, which approaches negative infinity.\n\nBut age can't be negative, so the minimal B is 0, achieved when A is as large as possible, but B remains non-negative.\n\nWait, but 9A + B = 220, with A and B being non-negative integers.\n\nTo minimize B, we maximize A.\n\nThe maximum A can be is floor(220 / 9) = 24, since 9 * 24 = 216, and B = 220 - 216 = 4.\n\nIf A = 25, then 9 * 25 = 225, which would require B = 220 - 225 = -5, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal B is 4, when nine people are 24 years old, and one is 4 years old.\n\nBut is this possible? In terms of friendships, if nine people have 24 friends each, and one has 4 friends, but friendships are mutual, meaning that if person A is friends with person B, then person B is also friends with person A.\n\nGiven that, the sum of degrees should be even, which it is (220), and the number of friendships is 110, which matches sum of degrees divided by 2.\n\nBut in reality, since the room only has 10 people, and each person can have at most 9 friends within the room, having someone with 24 friends would imply that they have friends outside the room.\n\nIf that's allowed, then the minimal age is 4.\n\nBut perhaps the problem implies that friendships are only within the room, meaning that each person's number of friends can't exceed 9.\n\nIf that's the case, then having ages beyond 9 doesn't make sense, as they can't have more than 9 friends in the room.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that 10 people each with 9 friends would only sum to 90, which is less than 220.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reach a sum of 220 is to allow ages beyond 9, implying friendships outside the room.\n\nTherefore, the minimal age is 4, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that each person's age equals their number of friends, and the total number of friendships is 110.\n\nIf friendships are only within the room, then the sum of degrees (ages) should be 2 * 110 = 220, as established.\n\nBut with 10 people, each having at most 9 friends, the maximum sum of ages is 10 * 9 = 90, which is less than 220.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption that friendships are only within the room is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, friendships must include people outside the room, and ages reflect the total number of friends, including those outside the room.\n\nIn that case, ages can be any non-negative integer, and the minimal age is 4, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose that some people have ages higher than 9, but the number of friends they have within the room is limited to 9.\n\nIn that case, their age would still reflect only their friends within the room, which is up to 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"each person has the same number of friends as their age in years,\" which seems to suggest that age represents the total number of friends, regardless of whether they are in the room or not.\n\nGiven that, the minimal age is 4.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to have higher ages for some people, allowing for a younger minimal age.\n\nWait, suppose nine people have 25 friends each, and one has 220 - 225 = -5, which is invalid.\n\nSo, A can't be 25, as that would require B to be negative.\n\nTherefore, A max is 24, with B = 4, as previously determined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ages aren't all the same except one.\n\nPerhaps some have higher ages, some have lower, but the sum is 220.\n\nHowever, to minimize the youngest age, we should maximize the ages of the others, which leads to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the youngest person is 4 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]\n"
