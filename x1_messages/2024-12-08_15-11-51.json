You can store the evidence into a variable #E[index] that can be called by later tools.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBritannica[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information from Britannica Encyclopedia. This tool is particularly useful in gaining knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, and other types of factual information.\nQAModel[input]: Tool that can answer questions either directly from common sense and general world knowledge, as well as answering questions given input context that may contain the answer.\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the Rosetta Stone and where is it currently located?"

I should start by searching for general information about it.\n\n#E1 = Britannica[\"Rosetta Stone\"]\n\nPlan: After getting the basic information from Britannica, I need to extract the significance of the Rosetta Stone from the text. Maybe I can ask a question-based model to help me with that.\n\n#E2 = QAModel[\"What is the significance of the Rosetta Stone? Given context: #E1\"]\n\nPlan: Now, I need to find out where the Rosetta Stone is currently located. I can probably find this information in the same Britannica entry or ask the QAModel again.\n\n#E3 = QAModel[\"Where is the Rosetta Stone currently located? Given context: #E1\"]\n\nFinal answer: The significance of the Rosetta Stone is #E2, and it is currently located at #E3."
