        "content": "So I've got this quadratic equation to solve: x\u00b2 - 6x + 8 = 0. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember there are a few ways to solve quadratic equations, like factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. I think I'll try factoring first since it's usually the simplest way if the equation factors nicely.\n\nSo, factoring. I need to find two numbers that multiply to 8 (the constant term) and add up to -6 (the coefficient of the x term). Let's see, the factors of 8 are 1 and 8, 2 and 4. But since they need to add up to -6, I should consider negative numbers. Let's try -2 and -4: (-2) * (-4) = 8 and (-2) + (-4) = -6. Perfect!\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as (x - 2)(x - 4) = 0.\n\nNow, to find the solutions, I set each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 2 = 0 \u21d2 x = 2\n\nx - 4 = 0 \u21d2 x = 4\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 2 and x = 4.\n\nBut just to make sure, I'll plug these values back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, x = 2:\n\n(2)\u00b2 - 6*(2) + 8 = 4 - 12 + 8 = 0. That checks out.\n\nNext, x = 4:\n\n(4)\u00b2 - 6*(4) + 8 = 16 - 24 + 8 = 0. Also correct.\n\nGreat, so factoring worked well here. But for practice, I'll also try solving this using the quadratic formula to see if I get the same answers.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [ -b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac) ] / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients from the quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -6, and c = 8.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nx = [ -(-6) \u00b1 \u221a( (-6)\u00b2 - 4*1*8 ) ] / (2*1)\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\nx = [ 6 \u00b1 \u221a(36 - 32) ] / 2\n\nx = [ 6 \u00b1 \u221a4 ] / 2\n\nx = [ 6 \u00b1 2 ] / 2\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\n1. x = (6 + 2)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\n2. x = (6 - 2)/2 = 4/2 = 2\n\nSame as before! So, both methods confirm that the solutions are x = 2 and x = 4.\n\nJust for completeness, I'll consider completing the square as well, even though it's a bit more involved.\n\nStarting with the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\nFirst, move the constant term to the other side:\n\nx\u00b2 - 6x = -8\n\nNow, to complete the square, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x. The coefficient of x is -6, so half of that is -3, and its square is 9.\n\nAdd 9 to both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 - 6x + 9 = -8 + 9\n\nx\u00b2 - 6x + 9 = 1\n\nNow, the left side is a perfect square trinomial:\n\n(x - 3)\u00b2 = 1\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n\u221a(x - 3)\u00b2 = \u00b1\u221a1\n\nx - 3 = \u00b11\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\n1. x - 3 = 1 \u21d2 x = 4\n\n2. x - 3 = -1 \u21d2 x = 2\n\nAgain, the same solutions as before.\n\nAlright, so no matter which method I use, I get x = 2 and x = 4 as the solutions to the equation x\u00b2 - 6x + 8 = 0.\n\nIt's good to remember that for quadratic equations, there can be zero, one, or two real solutions, depending on the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac). In this case, the discriminant is 4, which is positive, so there are two distinct real solutions.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. If I had to choose the easiest method, factoring was the quickest here, but it's always a good idea to know multiple methods in case factoring doesn't work.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ and } 4} \\]"
