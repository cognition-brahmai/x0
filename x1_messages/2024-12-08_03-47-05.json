        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a bakery trying to figure out how many croissants, muffins, and cookies to make each day to maximize their profits, given that they have 100 kg of flour to work with. Each type of pastry uses a different amount of flour and has a different profit margin. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints and the goals. The main constraint is the amount of flour available, which is 100 kg per day. Each pastry type uses a certain amount of flour:\n\n- Croissants: 0.1 kg per piece\n\n- Muffins: 0.05 kg per piece\n\n- Cookies: 0.02 kg per piece\n\nAnd the profits per piece are:\n\n- Croissants: $1\n\n- Muffins: $0.50\n\n- Cookies: $0.25\n\nThe goal is to maximize profit, so I need to find out how many of each pastry to produce daily, given the flour limitation.\n\nThis sounds like an optimization problem, specifically a linear programming problem, where I have to maximize the profit function subject to the flour constraint.\n\nLet me define variables for the number of each pastry type produced daily:\n\nLet:\n\n- x = number of croissants\n\n- y = number of muffins\n\n- z = number of cookies\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 1x + 0.5y + 0.25z\n\nThe flour constraint is:\n\n0.1x + 0.05y + 0.02z \u2264 100\n\nAlso, since you can't produce negative pastries, we have:\n\nx \u2265 0\n\ny \u2265 0\n\nz \u2265 0\n\nNow, to solve this, I can use the method of linear programming. But since I'm not sure about the exact tools allowed here, I'll try to reason through it.\n\nOne way to approach this is to prioritize producing the pastry with the highest profit per unit of flour. In other words, find out which pastry gives the most profit per kg of flour used.\n\nLet's calculate the profit per kg for each pastry:\n\n- Croissants: $1 per 0.1 kg = $10 per kg\n\n- Muffins: $0.50 per 0.05 kg = $10 per kg\n\n- Cookies: $0.25 per 0.02 kg = $12.50 per kg\n\nWait, cookies have the highest profit per kg of flour!\n\nSo, to maximize profit, it seems like I should prioritize producing as many cookies as possible, since they give the highest profit per kg of flour.\n\nBut let's verify this approach.\n\nIf I allocate all the flour to cookies:\n\nz = 100 kg / 0.02 kg per cookie = 5000 cookies\n\nProfit = 5000 * $0.25 = $1250\n\nNow, what if I allocate some flour to croissants or muffins?\n\nLet's see, if I make only croissants:\n\nx = 100 kg / 0.1 kg per croissant = 1000 croissants\n\nProfit = 1000 * $1 = $1000\n\nOr only muffins:\n\ny = 100 kg / 0.05 kg per muffin = 2000 muffins\n\nProfit = 2000 * $0.50 = $1000\n\nSo, indeed, focusing on cookies gives a higher profit than focusing on croissants or muffins alone.\n\nBut maybe a combination would yield an even higher profit. Let's check.\n\nSuppose I produce some cookies and some croissants.\n\nLet\u2019s say I produce z cookies and x croissants, with 0.02z + 0.1x \u2264 100\n\nProfit = 0.25z + 1x\n\nI need to maximize this under the flour constraint.\n\nSimilarly, for cookies and muffins:\n\n0.02z + 0.05y \u2264 100\n\nProfit = 0.25z + 0.5y\n\nOr all three together:\n\n0.02z + 0.05y + 0.1x \u2264 100\n\nProfit = 0.25z + 0.5y + 1x\n\nGiven that cookies have the highest profit per kg of flour, any flour used for croissants or muffins would yield less profit than if it were used for cookies.\n\nTherefore, to maximize profit, the bakery should produce only cookies, using all available flour.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning.\n\nSuppose I produce one croissant instead of cookies. That uses 0.1 kg of flour and gives $1 profit.\n\nIf I use that 0.1 kg to make cookies, I can make 0.1 / 0.02 = 5 cookies, giving 5 * $0.25 = $1.25 profit.\n\nSo, for every 0.1 kg of flour, I get $1.25 from cookies vs. $1 from a croissant. Similarly, for muffins:\n\n0.05 kg flour gives $0.50 profit.\n\nWith that 0.05 kg, I can make 0.05 / 0.02 = 2.5 cookies, giving 2.5 * $0.25 = $0.625, which is more than $0.50.\n\nWait, but 2.5 cookies aren't possible, so let's consider whole numbers.\n\nIf I use 0.05 kg for a muffin, I get $0.50.\n\nAlternatively, with 0.05 kg, I can make 2 cookies (since 2 * 0.02 = 0.04 kg), giving $0.50 profit.\n\nBut then I have 0.01 kg of flour left, which isn't enough for another cookie.\n\nSo, in this case, producing muffins and cookies could yield the same profit for that 0.05 kg.\n\nBut overall, since cookies have higher profit per kg, it's better to produce as many cookies as possible.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to produce only cookies with the entire 100 kg of flour.\n\nNumber of cookies: 100 / 0.02 = 5000 cookies\n\nProfit: 5000 * $0.25 = $1250\n\nIf I were to produce a combination, the profit would be less.\n\nFor example, producing 1000 croissants:\n\nFlour used: 1000 * 0.1 = 10 kg\n\nRemaining flour: 90 kg\n\nWith 90 kg, I can produce 90 / 0.02 = 4500 cookies\n\nProfit: 1000 * $1 + 4500 * $0.25 = $1000 + $1125 = $2125\n\nWait, that's higher than producing only cookies.\n\nWait, but the flour used for croissants is 10 kg, leaving 90 kg for cookies.\n\nBut earlier, if I produce only cookies with all 100 kg, I get 5000 cookies * $0.25 = $1250\n\nBut in this case, producing 1000 croissants and 4500 cookies gives $2125, which is higher.\n\nHmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nLet me check the calculations.\n\nFlour for 1000 croissants: 1000 * 0.1 = 10 kg\n\nRemaining flour: 100 - 10 = 90 kg\n\nNumber of cookies with 90 kg: 90 / 0.02 = 4500 cookies\n\nProfit from croissants: 1000 * $1 = $1000\n\nProfit from cookies: 4500 * $0.25 = $1125\n\nTotal profit: $1000 + $1125 = $2125\n\nBut earlier, with only cookies: 5000 * $0.25 = $1250\n\nSo, producing some croissants and some cookies gives a higher profit than producing only cookies.\n\nWait, this is confusing. According to this, producing 1000 croissants and 4500 cookies gives $2125, which is more than $1250 from only cookies.\n\nBut according to the profit per kg:\n\n- Croissants: $10 per kg\n\n- Muffins: $10 per kg\n\n- Cookies: $12.50 per kg\n\nSo, cookies have higher profit per kg, but in practice, a combination of croissants and cookies gives higher total profit.\n\nThis suggests that my initial approach might be flawed.\n\nLet me consider the profit per kg of flour for each pastry:\n\n- Croissants: $1 per 0.1 kg = $10 per kg\n\n- Muffins: $0.50 per 0.05 kg = $10 per kg\n\n- Cookies: $0.25 per 0.02 kg = $12.50 per kg\n\nSo, cookies have the highest profit per kg of flour.\n\nBut in the earlier example, producing some croissants and some cookies yields a higher total profit than producing only cookies.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there's an error in the calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nIf I produce only cookies:\n\nNumber of cookies: 100 / 0.02 = 5000 cookies\n\nProfit: 5000 * $0.25 = $1250\n\nIf I produce 1000 croissants and 4500 cookies:\n\nFlour for croissants: 1000 * 0.1 = 10 kg\n\nFlour for cookies: 4500 * 0.02 = 90 kg\n\nTotal flour used: 10 + 90 = 100 kg\n\nProfit: 1000 * $1 + 4500 * $0.25 = $1000 + $1125 = $2125\n\nWait, that's higher than $1250.\n\nBut according to profit per kg, cookies should be better.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the opportunity cost differently.\n\nLet me consider producing only croissants:\n\n100 / 0.1 = 1000 croissants\n\nProfit: 1000 * $1 = $1000\n\nOnly muffins:\n\n100 / 0.05 = 2000 muffins\n\nProfit: 2000 * $0.50 = $1000\n\nOnly cookies:\n\n100 / 0.02 = 5000 cookies\n\nProfit: 5000 * $0.25 = $1250\n\nCombination of croissants and cookies:\n\nAs above, 1000 croissants and 4500 cookies: $2125\n\nAlternatively, 500 croissants and 4750 cookies:\n\nFlour for croissants: 500 * 0.1 = 50 kg\n\nFlour for cookies: 4750 * 0.02 = 95 kg\n\nTotal flour: 50 + 95 = 145 kg, which is more than 100 kg. Wait, that's not possible.\n\nWait, I must ensure that the total flour does not exceed 100 kg.\n\nLet me adjust.\n\nIf I produce x croissants and z cookies:\n\n0.1x + 0.02z \u2264 100\n\nProfit: 1x + 0.25z\n\nI need to maximize 1x + 0.25z subject to 0.1x + 0.02z \u2264 100, x \u2265 0, z \u2265 0\n\nLet me solve this linear programming problem.\n\nFirst, express z in terms of x from the constraint:\n\n0.1x + 0.02z \u2264 100\n\n=> 0.02z \u2264 100 - 0.1x\n\n=> z \u2264 (100 - 0.1x)/0.02\n\n=> z \u2264 5000 - 5x\n\nNow, the profit function is:\n\nProfit = 1x + 0.25z\n\nSubstitute z:\n\nProfit \u2264 1x + 0.25(5000 - 5x)\n\n= 1x + 1250 - 1.25x\n\n= 1250 - 0.25x\n\nTo maximize profit, I need to minimize x, since profit decreases as x increases.\n\nSo, set x = 0, then z = 5000, profit = $1250\n\nWait, but earlier combination gave higher profit.\n\nWait, there must be a mistake here.\n\nLet me check the substitution.\n\nProfit = 1x + 0.25z\n\nSubject to z \u2264 5000 - 5x\n\nBut z cannot exceed 5000 - 5x, but it can be less.\n\nTo maximize profit = 1x + 0.25z, given that z \u2264 5000 - 5x and x \u2265 0, z \u2265 0\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, and the maximum occurs at the boundaries.\n\nSo, let's evaluate profit at the corner points of the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by:\n\nx \u2265 0\n\nz \u2265 0\n\n0.1x + 0.02z \u2264 100\n\nSo, the corner points are:\n\n1. x = 0, z = 0 \u2192 profit = 0\n\n2. x = 0, z = 5000 \u2192 profit = 0 + 0.25*5000 = $1250\n\n3. z = 0, x = 1000 \u2192 profit = 1*1000 + 0 = $1000\n\n4. The intersection point where x and z are both positive and satisfy 0.1x + 0.02z = 100\n\nLet me find this intersection point.\n\nFrom 0.1x + 0.02z = 100\n\nLet's solve for z in terms of x:\n\nz = (100 - 0.1x)/0.02 = 5000 - 5x\n\nNow, plug into profit:\n\nProfit = 1x + 0.25(5000 - 5x) = 1x + 1250 - 1.25x = 1250 - 0.25x\n\nThis is a decreasing function in x, so profit is maximized when x is minimized.\n\nTherefore, set x = 0, then z = 5000, profit = $1250\n\nWait, but earlier combination of x=1000 and z=4500 gave $2125, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, let's check the calculation for that combination.\n\nIf x=1000, z=4500:\n\nFlour used: 0.1*1000 + 0.02*4500 = 100 + 90 = 190 kg, which exceeds the 100 kg available.\n\nWait, that's not possible. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, 0.1*1000 = 10 kg\n\n0.02*4500 = 90 kg\n\nTotal flour used: 10 + 90 = 100 kg, which is correct.\n\nSo, profit = 1000*1 + 4500*0.25 = 1000 + 1125 = $2125\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, profit = 1250 - 0.25x\n\nWait, there must be an error in that calculation.\n\nLet me re-express the profit function.\n\nProfit = 1x + 0.25z\n\nSubject to 0.1x + 0.02z = 100\n\nLet me use the method of substitution.\n\nFrom the constraint: 0.02z = 100 - 0.1x\n\n=> z = (100 - 0.1x)/0.02 = 5000 - 5x\n\nNow, substitute into profit:\n\nProfit = 1x + 0.25(5000 - 5x) = 1x + 1250 - 1.25x = 1250 - 0.25x\n\nThis suggests that profit decreases as x increases, so the maximum profit occurs when x is minimized, i.e., x=0, z=5000, profit=$1250\n\nBut earlier, with x=1000, z=4500, profit=$2125\n\nWait, that's higher than $1250, but according to this, it should be less.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the flour usage.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFor x=1000 croissants: 1000 * 0.1 kg = 100 kg\n\nFor z=4500 cookies: 4500 * 0.02 kg = 90 kg\n\nTotal flour used: 100 + 90 = 190 kg, which exceeds the available 100 kg.\n\nAh, that's the mistake. I thought 1000 croissants and 4500 cookies use 100 + 90 = 190 kg, but actually, the bakery only has 100 kg.\n\nSo, this combination is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit is indeed $1250 by producing only cookies.\n\nLet me confirm this with another approach.\n\nLet me consider the profit per pastry type per kg of flour.\n\n- Croissants: $1 per 0.1 kg = $10 per kg\n\n- Muffins: $0.50 per 0.05 kg = $10 per kg\n\n- Cookies: $0.25 per 0.02 kg = $12.50 per kg\n\nSo, cookies have the highest profit per kg of flour.\n\nTherefore, to maximize profit, the bakery should allocate all available flour to cookies.\n\nHence, produce 5000 cookies, yielding $1250 profit.\n\nAny diversion from this, such as producing some croissants or muffins, would result in lower overall profit, as shown by the profit per kg calculations.\n\nTherefore, the optimal production is:\n\n- 0 croissants\n\n- 0 muffins\n\n- 5000 cookies\n\nyielding a daily profit of $1250.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5000 \\text{ cookies for a daily profit of } \\$1250} \\]"
