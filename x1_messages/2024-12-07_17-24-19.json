        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If it takes 5 machines to produce 100 widgets in 10 hours, how long would it take for 10 machines to produce 200 widgets? Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of machines, the number of widgets, and the time taken. It seems like a problem involving direct and inverse proportions.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that 5 machines can produce 100 widgets in 10 hours. So, I want to find out how long it would take for 10 machines to produce 200 widgets.\n\nMaybe I should start by finding out the production rate per machine.\n\nSo, if 5 machines produce 100 widgets in 10 hours, then one machine would produce a fifth of that, right?\n\nSo, one machine produces 100 / 5 = 20 widgets in 10 hours.\n\nSo, the production rate per machine is 20 widgets per 10 hours, which is 2 widgets per hour.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's check.\n\nIf one machine produces 2 widgets per hour, then 5 machines would produce 5 * 2 = 10 widgets per hour.\n\nIn 10 hours, they would produce 10 * 10 = 100 widgets, which matches the given information. Okay, good.\n\nNow, if we have 10 machines, each producing 2 widgets per hour, then together they would produce 10 * 2 = 20 widgets per hour.\n\nWe need to produce 200 widgets. So, time required would be total widgets divided by production rate.\n\nTime = 200 widgets / 20 widgets per hour = 10 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but is there something I'm missing?\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe using the concept of machine-hours.\n\nTotal production is 100 widgets in 10 hours with 5 machines.\n\nSo, total machine-hours = 5 machines * 10 hours = 50 machine-hours for 100 widgets.\n\nTherefore, machine-hours per widget = 50 / 100 = 0.5 machine-hours per widget.\n\nNow, for 200 widgets, total machine-hours required = 200 * 0.5 = 100 machine-hours.\n\nIf we have 10 machines, then time required = total machine-hours / number of machines = 100 / 10 = 10 hours.\n\nAgain, I get 10 hours. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nBut somehow, I have a intuition that it might be less. Let's think about it again.\n\nIf 5 machines take 10 hours to produce 100 widgets, then to produce twice as many widgets (200), with twice as many machines (10), it should take the same amount of time, right?\n\nBecause the increase in the number of machines matches the increase in the number of widgets.\n\nSo, time should remain the same, which is 10 hours.\n\nWait, but let's consider another angle. If I double the number of machines, I can produce twice as many widgets in the same time, or the same number of widgets in half the time.\n\nBut in this case, since both the number of machines and the number of widgets are doubled, the time should remain the same.\n\nSo, yes, it should still take 10 hours.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using the formula:\n\nTime = (Number of widgets) / (Production rate per machine * Number of machines)\n\nWe already know the production rate per machine is 2 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, Time = 200 / (2 * 10) = 200 / 20 = 10 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of direct and inverse proportions.\n\nThe number of machines and the time required are inversely proportional, because more machines can produce the same amount in less time.\n\nThe number of widgets and the time required are directly proportional, because more widgets take more time to produce.\n\nSo, combining these, the formula would be:\n\n(Time2) / (Time1) = (Widgets2 / Widgets1) * (Machines1 / Machines2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime2 / 10 = (200 / 100) * (5 / 10)\n\nTime2 / 10 = 2 * 0.5\n\nTime2 / 10 = 1\n\nTherefore, Time2 = 10 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 10 hours.\n\nMaybe that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this.\n\nIs there any limitation on the machines or the production process that might change with more machines? For example, maybe there is a space constraint in the factory, or some machines might get in each other's way.\n\nBut since nothing like that is mentioned in the problem, I can assume that each machine works independently without affecting the others.\n\nTherefore, the time should remain the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a learning effect or some economies of scale, but again, since no such information is provided, I should assume that each machine operates independently.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it would take 10 machines 10 hours to produce 200 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
