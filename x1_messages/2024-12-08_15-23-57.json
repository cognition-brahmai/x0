        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 apples and 7 oranges in the basket to start with. So, the total number of fruits initially is 5 apples plus 7 oranges, which equals 12 fruits.\n\nNow, Tom takes 2 apples and 3 oranges. So, we need to subtract those from the initial amounts. After Tom takes his fruits, the number of apples left would be 5 - 2 = 3 apples, and the number of oranges left would be 7 - 3 = 4 oranges.\n\nNext, Jane takes 1 apple and 2 oranges from what's left in the basket. So, we subtract those from the remaining fruits after Tom's take. Apples left after Jane takes hers: 3 - 1 = 2 apples. Oranges left: 4 - 2 = 2 oranges.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits left in the basket is 2 apples plus 2 oranges, which equals 4 fruits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
