        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a farmer with a total of 100 animals on his farm, and these animals are either chickens or cows. We're also told that there are 284 legs in total among all these animals. We need to figure out how many chickens there are.\n\nFirst, I think it's important to know how many legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, right? And cows have 4 legs. That's a basic fact about these animals.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K. According to the problem, the total number of animals is 100, so we can write the equation:\n\nC + K = 100\n\nThat makes sense. Now, for the legs. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4, the total number of legs would be:\n\n2C + 4K = 284\n\nOkay, so now we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) C + K = 100\n\n2) 2C + 4K = 284\n\nI think we can solve this system to find the values of C and K.\n\nMaybe I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute into the second equation. Let's solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 100 - K\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n2(100 - K) + 4K = 284\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n200 - 2K + 4K = 284\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n200 + 2K = 284\n\nNow, subtract 200 from both sides:\n\n2K = 84\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nK = 42\n\nSo, there are 42 cows. Now, plug this back into the first equation to find C:\n\nC = 100 - 42 = 58\n\nTherefore, there are 58 chickens.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 58 chickens with 2 legs each, that's 58 * 2 = 116 legs. And 42 cows with 4 legs each is 42 * 4 = 168 legs. Adding those together: 116 + 168 = 284 legs. Yes, that matches the total given.\n\nSo, the farmer has 58 chickens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{58} \\]"
