For every plan, there should be corresponding evidence which would be the output of a function taking an input string that could be the user query, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool allowing users to search for information via DuckDuckGo search engine. It helps in locating potential sites having answers to the user's query. The function does not directly answer but locates possible sources.\nTextParser[input]: Parses one or more websites from the input string comprising newline separated links. Input includes one or more links, and the output contains the textual content of these links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Pulls out URLs from plain text and gives a plain text, newline-separated list of URLs.\nBrainyQA[input]: Language model for answering queries based on a text passage. The input has to be a question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, like What is the dog's breed, given :evidence1:?\n\nInputs to functions should be simple strings, devoid of quotes or \"+\" for concatenating a string with an evidence variable, like BrainyQA[What is New York's population, given :evidence3:?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Initial action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action, based on :evidence0:'s outcome]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and its input parameter, possibly referring to prior evidence, like \"Considering context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some notable works of J.K. Rowling besides Harry Potter and how were they received?"
