        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a train travels at an average speed of 60 kilometers per hour, and it takes 3 hours and 45 minutes to travel between two cities. I need to find out the distance between these cities.\n\nFirst, I know that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nGiven that the speed is 60 kilometers per hour, I need to find out what the time is in hours because the unit for speed is kilometers per hour.\n\nThe time given is 3 hours and 45 minutes. I need to convert this into hours. I know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is:\n\n\\[ 45 \\div 60 = 0.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the total time in hours is:\n\n\\[ 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\times 3.75 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 3 = 180 \\]\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 0.75 = 45 \\]\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n\\[ 180 + 45 = 225 \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two cities is 225 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can use the formula for speed and see if it makes sense.\n\nSpeed is distance over time, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nIf I plug in the values:\n\n\\[ 60 = \\frac{225}{3.75} \\]\n\nLet me check that:\n\n\\[ 225 \\div 3.75 = 60 \\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert everything into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 45 minutes, which totals 225 minutes.\n\nBut then the speed is in kilometers per hour, so it might not be as straightforward. I think sticking with hours is better for consistency.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that in one hour, the train covers 60 kilometers. So in 3 hours, it would cover:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 3 = 180 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nThen, in 45 minutes, which is 3/4 of an hour, it would cover:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 45 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[ 180 + 45 = 225 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nI could also use the proportion method. If 60 kilometers are covered in 1 hour, then how many kilometers are covered in 3.75 hours?\n\nSetting up the proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60 \\text{ km}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = \\frac{x \\text{ km}}{3.75 \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 60 \\times 3.75 = 225 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider the time in hours and minutes separately.\n\nIn 3 hours, distance covered is:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 3 = 180 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nIn 45 minutes, which is \\( \\frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \\) hours, distance covered is:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 0.75 = 45 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nTotal distance:\n\n\\[ 180 + 45 = 225 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nConsistent with previous calculations.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The distance between the two cities is definitely 225 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{225} \\]"
