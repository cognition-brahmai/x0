        "content": "Let's see. So, the factory produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. It says that they produce twice as many Type A widgets as Type B widgets. And the total production per day is 450 widgets. I need to find out how many Type B widgets are produced.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably define variables for the number of each type of widget. Let's say:\n\n- Let B be the number of Type B widgets produced per day.\n\n- Since they produce twice as many Type A widgets as Type B, then the number of Type A widgets is 2B.\n\nNow, the total production is the sum of Type A and Type B widgets, which is 450 per day. So, I can write the equation:\n\nB + 2B = 450\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3B = 450\n\nNow, to find B, I just need to divide both sides by 3:\n\nB = 450 / 3\n\nB = 150\n\nSo, the factory produces 150 Type B widgets per day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If B is 150, then Type A is twice that, which is 300. And 150 plus 300 is 450, which matches the total production. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of ratios. Since Type A is twice Type B, the ratio of Type A to Type B is 2:1. That means for every 2 Type A widgets, there is 1 Type B widget. So, the total parts are 2 + 1 = 3 parts.\n\nGiven that the total production is 450 widgets, each part represents 450 / 3 = 150 widgets.\n\nTherefore, Type B, being one part, is 150 widgets, and Type A, being two parts, is 300 widgets.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can approach it another way to confirm. Let's assume the number of Type B widgets is x. Then, Type A widgets would be 2x. The total is x + 2x = 3x = 450.\n\nSolving for x: x = 450 / 3 = 150.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the factory produces 150 Type B widgets per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
