        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about marbles in a bag. There are red, blue, and green marbles, and I'm given two ratios: the ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:4, and the ratio of blue to green marbles is 2:5. I need to find the ratio of red to green marbles.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what these ratios mean. The ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:4, which means for every 3 red marbles, there are 4 blue marbles. Similarly, the ratio of blue to green marbles is 2:5, meaning for every 2 blue marbles, there are 5 green marbles.\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of red to green marbles. But I have these two separate ratios involving blue marbles. So, maybe I can find a common term here, which is blue, and link the two ratios together.\n\nLet me write down the given ratios:\n\nRed : Blue = 3 : 4\n\nBlue : Green = 2 : 5\n\nI need to find Red : Green.\n\nTo link these, I need to make the number of blue marbles in both ratios the same so that I can directly compare red and green marbles.\n\nLet's see, in the first ratio, blue is 4 parts, and in the second ratio, blue is 2 parts. To make them the same, I can find a common multiple of 4 and 2, which is 4.\n\nSo, I'll adjust the second ratio (Blue : Green = 2:5) to have blue as 4 parts.\n\nTo do that, I can multiply both parts of the second ratio by 2:\n\nBlue : Green = 2*2 : 5*2 = 4 : 10\n\nNow, both ratios have blue as 4 parts:\n\nRed : Blue = 3 : 4\n\nBlue : Green = 4 : 10\n\nSince the blue part is the same in both ratios, I can combine them:\n\nRed : Blue : Green = 3 : 4 : 10\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red to green marbles is 3:10.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to confirm this? Maybe by using variables.\n\nLet me assign a variable for the number of blue marbles, since it's common in both ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of blue marbles is B.\n\nGiven that Red : Blue = 3:4, so Red = (3/4)B\n\nAlso, Blue : Green = 2:5, so Green = (5/2)B\n\nNow, I need to find Red : Green, which is (3/4)B : (5/2)B\n\nTo simplify this ratio, I can divide both parts by B (assuming B is not zero):\n\n(3/4) : (5/2)\n\nTo divide fractions, I can multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second:\n\n(3/4) / (5/2) = (3/4)*(2/5) = (3*2)/(4*5) = 6/20 = 3/10\n\nSo, the ratio of red to green marbles is 3:10.\n\nAlternatively, I can multiply both parts of the ratio by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(3/4)*4 : (5/2)*4 \u2192 3 : 10\n\nSame result.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe by using the concept of least common multiple or something similar.\n\nLet me think differently. The ratio of red to blue is 3:4, and blue to green is 2:5.\n\nI can think of these ratios as fractions:\n\nRed/Blue = 3/4\n\nBlue/Green = 2/5\n\nI need Red/Green.\n\nUsing the transitive property, Red/Green = (Red/Blue) * (Blue/Green) = (3/4) * (2/5) = 6/20 = 3/10\n\nSo, Red : Green = 3 : 10\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the number of blue marbles as a multiple of both 4 and 2, which is 4, then:\n\nIf Blue = 4 units,\n\nThen Red = 3 units (from Red:Blue = 3:4)\n\nAnd Green = (5/2)*2 = 5 units (since Blue:Green = 2:5, but Blue is 4, which is twice 2, so Green is twice 5, which is 10)\n\nWait, that gives Red:Green = 3:10 again.\n\nAlternatively, if I set Blue = 4x, then Red = 3x, and Green = (5/2)*(4x) = 10x, so Red:Green = 3x:10x = 3:10.\n\nSame result again.\n\nI think it's consistent. So, the ratio of red to green marbles is 3:10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:10} \\]"
