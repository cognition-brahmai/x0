This branch of physics is often contrasted with quantum mechanics, which deals with phenomena on a very small scale, such as atoms and subatomic particles. Electromagnetism, on the other hand, is the study of the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This force is responsible for phenomena such as light and magnetism.

        "content": "Let's see. The paragraph talks about different branches of physics. It mentions classical mechanics, which is about how big things move when forces act on them. Then there's quantum mechanics, which is for really tiny things like atoms. And electromagnetism is about the electromagnetic force, which causes things like magnetism and light.\n\nSo, the question is, which branch of physics studies light? Looking at the options:\n\nA. Classical mechanics - that's about motion of big objects, like cars or planets, not specifically about light.\n\nB. Quantum mechanics - that deals with tiny particles, and light can behave like particles called photons, but is that the main branch for studying light?\n\nC. Thermodynamics - that's more about heat and energy, not directly about light.\n\nD. Electromagnetism - the paragraph says this is responsible for phenomena such as light and magnetism.\n\nE. None of the above - well, if one of the above is correct, this wouldn't be right.\n\nFrom the paragraph, electromagnetism is directly mentioned in relation to light. So, it seems like the answer should be D. Electromagnetism.\n\nBut just to make sure, I know that light is an electromagnetic wave, and electromagnetism studies electromagnetic waves, including light. Quantum mechanics also studies light, especially its particle nature, but the paragraph specifies that electromagnetism deals with phenomena like light.\n\nSo, based on the information given, I think D. Electromagnetism is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
