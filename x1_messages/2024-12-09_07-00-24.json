        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three factories: A, B, and C, all producing the same product. We're given that Factory B produces 1000 units per day. Factory A produces 20% more than Factory B, and Factory C produces 30% less than Factory A. Our goal is to find out how many units each factory produces daily.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"20% more\" and \"30% less\" mean in terms of production.\n\nStarting with Factory B, which produces 1000 units per day.\n\nFactory A produces 20% more than Factory B. To find out how much more that is, we calculate 20% of 1000 units.\n\n20% of 1000 is (20/100) * 1000 = 0.2 * 1000 = 200 units.\n\nSo, Factory A produces 1000 units + 200 units = 1200 units per day.\n\nNext, Factory C produces 30% less than Factory A. First, we need to find out what 30% of Factory A's production is.\n\n30% of 1200 units is (30/100) * 1200 = 0.3 * 1200 = 360 units.\n\nTherefore, Factory C produces 1200 units - 360 units = 840 units per day.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Factory A: 1200 units per day\n\n- Factory B: 1000 units per day\n\n- Factory C: 840 units per day\n\nLet's double-check these calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, Factory A produces 20% more than Factory B.\n\nGiven Factory B produces 1000 units, 20% of 1000 is indeed 200 units, so Factory A produces 1000 + 200 = 1200 units.\n\nNext, Factory C produces 30% less than Factory A.\n\n30% of Factory A's 1200 units is 360 units, so Factory C produces 1200 - 360 = 840 units.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the daily production is:\n\nFactory A: 1200 units\n\nFactory B: 1000 units\n\nFactory C: 840 units\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200 \\text{ units (Factory A)},\\ 1000 \\text{ units (Factory B)},\\ 840 \\text{ units (Factory C)}} \\]"
