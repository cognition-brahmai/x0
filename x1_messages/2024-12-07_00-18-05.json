        "content": "The author you're referring to is Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. He was a French novelist and playwright who is primarily known for his sequence of almost 100 novels and plays collectively titled \"La Com\u00e9die Humaine.\" This series offers a panorama of French society in the years after the Napoleonic Wars, particularly focusing on the ambitious and often ruthless rise of characters in Parisian society. 'Lost Illusions' ('Illusions perdues') and 'Eug\u00e9nie Grandet' are both part of this extensive collection. Balzac's works are characterized by their detailed social realism and their deep psychological portraits of his characters. His influence on realism in literature is significant, and he is considered one of the founders of the realist tradition."
