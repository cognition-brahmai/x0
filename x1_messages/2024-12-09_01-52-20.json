        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a tree grows 2 inches taller each year. I need to figure out how tall it will be after 50 years, and it starts off at 10 feet tall. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the units I'm dealing with. The tree's initial height is given in feet, but its annual growth is in inches. To make things easier, I should probably convert everything to the same unit. I think converting feet to inches would be best because the growth is in inches.\n\nSo, 1 foot equals 12 inches. The tree is initially 10 feet tall, so in inches that would be:\n\n10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.\n\nAlright, now the tree grows 2 inches each year. Over 50 years, the total growth would be:\n\n2 inches/year * 50 years = 100 inches.\n\nNow, to find the total height after 50 years, I just need to add the initial height to the total growth:\n\n120 inches + 100 inches = 220 inches.\n\nBut the initial question has the height in feet, so maybe I should convert the final answer back to feet and inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n220 inches / 12 inches/foot = 18 feet with a remainder of 4 inches.\n\nSo, the tree will be 18 feet 4 inches tall after 50 years.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Starting at 10 feet, growing 2 inches each year for 50 years.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in feet. Since 2 inches is 2/12 feet, which is 1/6 feet.\n\nSo, annual growth in feet: 2 inches / 12 = 1/6 feet.\n\nOver 50 years: 50 * 1/6 = 50/6 \u2248 8.333 feet.\n\nAdding to the initial height: 10 feet + 8.333 feet = 18.333 feet.\n\nWhich is 18 feet and 0.333*12 inches \u2248 4 inches. So, 18 feet 4 inches. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise with the fractions:\n\n50 * (1/6) = 50/6 = 8 2/6 = 8 1/3 feet.\n\nSo, 10 + 8 1/3 = 18 1/3 feet.\n\nSince 1/3 of a foot is 4 inches (because 12 inches * 1/3 = 4 inches), it's indeed 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the units consistently. If I keep everything in inches, I avoid any potential errors in conversion.\n\nInitial height: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.\n\nAnnual growth: 2 inches/year.\n\nOver 50 years: 2 inches/year * 50 years = 100 inches.\n\nTotal height: 120 inches + 100 inches = 220 inches.\n\nNow, to convert back to feet and inches:\n\n220 inches / 12 inches/foot = 18 feet with a remainder of 4 inches.\n\nSo, 18 feet 4 inches.\n\nYes, that seems consistent across different methods.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. The tree starts at 10 feet, grows 2 inches each year for 50 years, resulting in a total height of 18 feet 4 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18\\ \\text{feet}\\ 4\\ \\text{inches}} \\]"
