        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. A store sells apples for $1.50 per pound and oranges for $2.00 per pound. A customer buys a total of 8 pounds of fruit and spends $13.50. I need to figure out how many pounds of apples and oranges they bought.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the pounds of apples bought.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the pounds of oranges bought.\n\nFrom the problem, I know two things:\n\n1. The total weight of fruit bought is 8 pounds.\n\n2. The total cost of the fruit is $13.50.\n\nSo, I can write these as equations:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 8 \\) (total pounds)\n\n2. \\( 1.50a + 2.00o = 13.50 \\) (total cost)\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I need to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( o \\).\n\nI think the easiest way to solve this is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 8 - o \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 1.50(8 - o) + 2.00o = 13.50 \\)\n\nNow, I'll distribute the 1.50:\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times 8 = 12.00 \\)\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times (-o) = -1.50o \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( 12.00 - 1.50o + 2.00o = 13.50 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\( 12.00 + ( -1.50o + 2.00o ) = 13.50 \\)\n\n\\( 12.00 + 0.50o = 13.50 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 12.00 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.50o = 1.50 \\)\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.50:\n\n\\( o = \\frac{1.50}{0.50} = 3 \\)\n\nSo, the customer bought 3 pounds of oranges.\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 8 - o = 8 - 3 = 5 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 5 pounds of apples and 3 pounds of oranges.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf apples are $1.50 per pound, then 5 pounds would cost \\( 5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50 \\) dollars.\n\nOranges are $2.00 per pound, so 3 pounds would cost \\( 3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal cost: \\( 7.50 + 6.00 = 13.50 \\) dollars, which matches the problem.\n\nAlso, total pounds: \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\) pounds, which also matches.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ pounds of apples and } 3 \\text{ pounds of oranges}} \\]"
