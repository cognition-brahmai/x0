Each step in your plan should correlate with an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the provided functions when supplied with an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nYahooSearch[input]: A tool that enables users to search for information through Yahoo's search engine. This tool helps in locating potential sites that may hold the answer to the user's question. The function doesn't provide a direct answer to the question but finds a list of sites that might contain the answer.\nSiteReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. The input consists of one or more links, and the output is plain text featuring the content of these links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and provides a plain text, newline-delimited response of URLs.\nInfoModel[input]: A question-answering language model, especially useful in answering queries based on an input text passage. The input must be a textual question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., How tall is Mount Everest, given :evidence1:?\n\nEach function merely requires a straightforward string as input, without any need for quotation marks or \"+\" to join a string with an evidence variable, e.g., InfoModel[Who is the president of the United States, given :evidence3:?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should conform to the following format:\nPlan: [Initial action to take based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action to take, based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may refer to prior evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: Carrying the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the light bulb and what were some of his other inventions?"
