Numerous studies have been conducted on this topic, and none have found a link between vaccines and autism. In fact, the original study that suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been thoroughly discredited and retracted by the journal that published it. It's important to get vaccinated to protect yourself and others from infectious diseases."
