        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a room full of people, 30% are wearing glasses, and 20% are wearing hats. If 10% are wearing both glasses and hats, what percentage of people are wearing either glasses or hats?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I remember there's a principle in set theory called the principle of inclusion-exclusion that might be useful here. It's used to find the total number of elements in the union of two sets, especially when there's an overlap between them.\n\nSo, if I let:\n\n- G be the set of people wearing glasses.\n\n- H be the set of people wearing hats.\n\nWe're given:\n\n- |G| = 30%\n\n- |H| = 20%\n\n- |G \u2229 H| = 10%\n\nAnd we need to find |G \u222a H|, which is the percentage of people wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nAccording to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the formula for two sets is:\n\n|G \u222a H| = |G| + |H| - |G \u2229 H|\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n|G \u222a H| = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should double-check if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the percentages as parts of the whole room. Let's assume there are 100 people in the room for simplicity, since we're dealing with percentages.\n\n- 30 people are wearing glasses.\n\n- 20 people are wearing hats.\n\n- 10 people are wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nSo, if 30 people are wearing glasses and 10 of those also wear hats, then the number of people wearing only glasses is 30 - 10 = 20 people.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people wearing only hats is 20 - 10 = 10 people.\n\nNow, the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats would be those wearing only glasses plus those wearing only hats plus those wearing both.\n\nSo, 20 (only glasses) + 10 (only hats) + 10 (both) = 40 people.\n\nTherefore, 40% of the people are wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to verify this. Maybe using a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine a Venn diagram with two circles overlapping. One circle represents people wearing glasses, and the other represents people wearing hats.\n\n- The overlap (both glasses and hats) is 10%.\n\n- The part of the glasses circle outside the overlap is 30% - 10% = 20%.\n\n- The part of the hats circle outside the overlap is 20% - 10% = 10%.\n\nSo, the total percentage wearing either glasses or hats is 20% (only glasses) + 10% (only hats) + 10% (both) = 40%.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the total percentage, it's 100%. Let's see what the percentage is for people wearing neither glasses nor hats.\n\nPeople wearing neither would be 100% - (20% only glasses + 10% only hats + 10% both) = 100% - 40% = 60%.\n\nBut we don't need that for this problem, but it's good to check consistency.\n\nWait, another thought: what if someone is wearing glasses and hats, but not both? Well, in this case, the \"both\" category is already accounted for separately.\n\nBut in this specific problem, since we're dealing with percentages and overlaps, the inclusion-exclusion principle seems to be the most direct method.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance of miscounting. If someone is wearing both glasses and hats, they are included in both the glasses and hats percentages. So, if we just add 30% and 20%, that would be 50%, but that counts the people wearing both twice. Therefore, we need to subtract the overlap once to get the correct total.\n\nSo, 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider here? For example, is there any possibility that someone could be wearing glasses and hats but not be included in the \"both\" category? I don't think so, because the \"both\" category should cover everyone wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nAlso, the problem seems to assume that these are the only categories: wearing glasses only, wearing hats only, wearing both, and wearing neither.\n\nGiven that, our calculation should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider an actual number of people. Suppose there are 100 people in the room.\n\n- 30 wear glasses.\n\n- 20 wear hats.\n\n- 10 wear both.\n\nSo, number of people wearing only glasses: 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nNumber of people wearing only hats: 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nNumber wearing both: 10.\n\nTotal wearing either glasses or hats: 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nTherefore, 40% of the people are wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. But to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe someone could be wearing glasses and hats separately, but the \"both\" category already accounts for that. No, \"both\" means wearing both at the same time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me by providing overlapping categories, but I don't think that's the case here. It's a straightforward inclusion-exclusion problem.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\n|G \u222a H| = |G| + |H| - |G \u2229 H|\n\nWhich is exactly what I used earlier.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
