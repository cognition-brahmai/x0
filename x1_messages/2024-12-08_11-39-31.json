        "content": "Let's see. So in this town, 1/3 of the people own cats, 1/4 own dogs, and 1/6 own both cats and dogs. I need to find out what fraction of the town's population owns neither cats nor dogs.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably figure out how many people own either cats or dogs or both. Then, I can subtract that from the total population to find out who owns neither.\n\nI remember there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle. It says that to find the total number of people who own cats or dogs, I should add the number of cat owners and the number of dog owners, and then subtract the number of people who own both, so I don't double-count them.\n\nSo, in terms of fractions:\n\nFraction owning cats: 1/3\n\nFraction owning dogs: 1/4\n\nFraction owning both: 1/6\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nFraction owning cats or dogs = (1/3) + (1/4) - (1/6)\n\nFirst, I need to add 1/3 and 1/4. To add fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nSo, 1/3 = 4/12\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nAdding them up: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12\n\nNow, subtract the fraction that owns both, which is 1/6. Again, convert to twelfths.\n\n1/6 = 2/12\n\nSo, 7/12 - 2/12 = 5/12\n\nTherefore, 5/12 of the town's population owns either cats or dogs or both.\n\nNow, to find the fraction that owns neither, I subtract this from the total population, which is 1 (or 12/12).\n\nSo, 1 - 5/12 = 7/12\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If 5/12 own cats or dogs, then 7/12 should own neither.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12\n\nThen, subtract 1/6 = 2/12\n\nSo, 7/12 - 2/12 = 5/12 own cats or dogs.\n\nThen, 1 - 5/12 = 7/12 own neither.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But I have a feeling I might be missing something.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using probabilities or something.\n\nSuppose the town has a population of X people.\n\nNumber owning cats: (1/3)X\n\nNumber owning dogs: (1/4)X\n\nNumber owning both: (1/6)X\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nNumber owning cats or dogs = (1/3)X + (1/4)X - (1/6)X\n\nCalculate that:\n\n(1/3)X = (4/12)X\n\n(1/4)X = (3/12)X\n\n(1/6)X = (2/12)X\n\nSo, (4/12 + 3/12 - 2/12)X = (5/12)X\n\nTherefore, 5/12 of the population owns cats or dogs.\n\nSo, neither would be 1 - 5/12 = 7/12\n\nWait, I'm getting the same answer again. Maybe 7/12 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of Venn diagrams.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle is cat owners (1/3), the other is dog owners (1/4), and the overlap is both (1/6).\n\nSo, the part that owns only cats is 1/3 - 1/6 = 1/6\n\nOnly dogs is 1/4 - 1/6 = 1/12\n\nBoth is 1/6\n\nSo, total owning pets is 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/6\n\nLet's see: 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nPlus 1/12: 1/3 + 1/12\n\nConvert to twelfths: 4/12 + 1/12 = 5/12\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo, neither is 7/12\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. The answer seems consistent across different methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider if there's any restriction or additional information in the problem that I'm missing.\n\nThe problem says \"1/3 own cats, 1/4 own dogs, and 1/6 own both.\"\n\nIs there any implication that some people might own other pets? But the question is about neither cats nor dogs, so other pets don't matter.\n\nAlso, is there a possibility that some people own multiple pets beyond cats and dogs? But again, the question is only about cat and dog ownership.\n\nWait, but in the Venn diagram approach, I accounted for people owning both cats and dogs.\n\nSo, the only groups are:\n\n- Only cats\n\n- Only dogs\n\n- Both cats and dogs\n\n- Neither\n\nAnd we're to find neither.\n\nGiven that, and the consistent answer of 7/12, I think 7/12 is correct.\n\nPerhaps to be absolutely sure, I can check with actual numbers.\n\nSuppose the town has 12 people (since 12 is a common multiple).\n\nNumber owning cats: (1/3)*12 = 4\n\nNumber owning dogs: (1/4)*12 = 3\n\nNumber owning both: (1/6)*12 = 2\n\nSo, only cats: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nOnly dogs: 3 - 2 = 1\n\nBoth: 2\n\nTotal pet owners: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\n\nTotal population: 12\n\nNeither: 12 - 5 = 7\n\nSo, fraction owning neither: 7/12\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nI think 7/12 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{12}} \\]"
