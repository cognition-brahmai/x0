        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 students in total, and everyone plays at least one sport. Some play soccer, some play basketball, and some might play both. I need to find out how many play both sports.\n\nSo, 12 students play soccer and 8 play basketball. If I add those up, that's 12 + 8 = 20. Wait, that's exactly the total number of students. But that can't be right because some students probably play both sports, so they are being counted twice in that addition.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If some students play both sports, then the total number of students playing sports should be the number of soccer players plus the number of basketball players minus the number who play both, so that we don't double-count those students.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nTotal students = Soccer players + Basketball players - Both sports players\n\nWe can plug in the numbers:\n\n20 = 12 + 8 - Both\n\nSo, 20 = 20 - Both\n\nThat means the number of students who play both sports is 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If there are 12 soccer players and 8 basketball players, and total students are 20, and every student plays at least one sport, then indeed, 12 + 8 = 20, so there are no students playing both sports.\n\nBut is that possible? Let me check again.\n\nIf no one plays both sports, then the total number of students playing sports would be exactly 12 + 8 = 20, which matches the total number of students. So, in this case, no one plays both sports.\n\nBut maybe there is a mistake here. Let's consider that some students might play both sports, which would mean that the total number of unique students would be less than the sum of soccer and basketball players.\n\nSo, to find the number of students who play both, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states that to find the total number of elements in two sets, you add the number in each set and then subtract the number in their intersection.\n\nSo, |Soccer \u222a Basketball| = |Soccer| + |Basketball| - |Soccer \u2229 Basketball|\n\nWe know that every student plays at least one sport, so the union of Soccer and Basketball is equal to the total number of students, which is 20.\n\nSo, 20 = 12 + 8 - |Soccer \u2229 Basketball|\n\nSolving for |Soccer \u2229 Basketball|:\n\n|Soccer \u2229 Basketball| = 12 + 8 - 20 = 0\n\nSo, according to this, no students play both sports.\n\nBut let me think about it another way. Suppose there are students who play both sports. Then, the total number of unique students would be less than the sum of soccer and basketball players.\n\nBut in this case, 12 + 8 = 20, which is exactly the total number of students, so there are no students who are being double-counted, meaning no one plays both sports.\n\nAlternatively, if there were students playing both sports, the total number of unique students would be less than 20, which contradicts the given information that there are 20 students, all playing at least one sport.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that no students play both soccer and basketball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
