        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the company has an annual revenue of $500,000. First, we need to find out what their expenses are. It says expenses are 40% of their revenue. So, expenses would be 40% of $500,000. Let me calculate that.\n\n40% of $500,000 is (40/100) * 500,000 = 0.4 * 500,000 = $200,000.\n\nSo, expenses are $200,000.\n\nNext, we need to find their profit before taxes. Profit before taxes would be revenue minus expenses. So, $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.\n\nNow, they pay taxes at a rate of 30% on their profit. So, taxes would be 30% of $300,000.\n\n30% of $300,000 is (30/100) * 300,000 = 0.3 * 300,000 = $90,000.\n\nFinally, to find the net income after taxes, we subtract the taxes from the profit before taxes.\n\nSo, net income = profit before taxes - taxes = $300,000 - $90,000 = $210,000.\n\nTherefore, the net income after taxes is $210,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210000} \\]"
