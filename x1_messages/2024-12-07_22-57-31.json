        "content": "Let's tackle this bacteria population problem. So, we've got a population of bacteria that doubles every 3 hours, and we start with 1000 bacteria. We need to find out how many there will be after 24 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the population to double every 3 hours. That means every 3-hour interval, the number of bacteria doubles. So, starting with 1000, after 3 hours, it becomes 2000, then after another 3 hours (so 6 hours total), it becomes 4000, and so on.\n\nNow, to find out how many times the population doubles in 24 hours, I need to divide 24 hours by the doubling time, which is 3 hours. So, 24 divided by 3 is 8. That means the population doubles 8 times in 24 hours.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the population after each doubling. Starting with 1000, and doubling 8 times. I can do this by multiplying 1000 by 2 raised to the power of 8, because each doubling is a multiplication by 2.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nFinal population = initial population \u00d7 2^(number of doubling periods)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFinal population = 1000 \u00d7 2^8\n\nNow, 2^8 is 256. So,\n\nFinal population = 1000 \u00d7 256 = 256,000\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 1000 bacteria:\n\nAfter 3 hours: 1000 \u00d7 2 = 2000\n\nAfter 6 hours: 2000 \u00d7 2 = 4000\n\nAfter 9 hours: 4000 \u00d7 2 = 8000\n\nAfter 12 hours: 8000 \u00d7 2 = 16,000\n\nAfter 15 hours: 16,000 \u00d7 2 = 32,000\n\nAfter 18 hours: 32,000 \u00d7 2 = 64,000\n\nAfter 21 hours: 64,000 \u00d7 2 = 128,000\n\nAfter 24 hours: 128,000 \u00d7 2 = 256,000\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, after 24 hours, there should be 256,000 bacteria.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the formula for exponential growth. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\nFinal amount = initial amount \u00d7 e^(rt)\n\nWhere e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the growth rate, and t is time.\n\nHowever, in this case, since the population doubles every 3 hours, it might be more straightforward to use the formula I used earlier, which is based on the number of doubling periods.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the growth rate r first. If the population doubles every 3 hours, then:\n\n2 = e^(r \u00d7 3)\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nln(2) = r \u00d7 3\n\nSo, r = ln(2)/3\n\nNow, using the exponential growth formula:\n\nFinal amount = 1000 \u00d7 e^(r \u00d7 24) = 1000 \u00d7 e^((ln(2)/3) \u00d7 24) = 1000 \u00d7 e^(ln(2) \u00d7 8) = 1000 \u00d7 e^(ln(256)) = 1000 \u00d7 256 = 256,000\n\nAgain, I get the same result, which reassures me that my calculation is correct.\n\nLet me think if there's any other factor I should consider. The problem doesn't mention any limitations on resources or space that might affect the bacteria growth, so I can assume unlimited growth within this 24-hour period.\n\nAlso, the initial time is at t=0 with 1000 bacteria, and we're looking for the population at t=24 hours.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for exponential growth in discrete intervals, which is similar to compound interest calculations.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nFinal amount = initial amount \u00d7 (1 + growth rate)^number of periods\n\nIn this case, the growth rate per period is 100% every 3 hours, since it doubles. So, growth rate per period is 1, and the number of periods is 24/3 = 8.\n\nThus, Final amount = 1000 \u00d7 (1 + 1)^8 = 1000 \u00d7 2^8 = 256,000\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that after 24 hours, the bacteria population will be 256,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the doubling time is exactly 3 hours, and whether 24 is perfectly divisible by 3. Yes, 24 divided by 3 is exactly 8, so there are no fractional periods to worry about.\n\nIf the time was not a multiple of the doubling time, I would need to adjust the calculation accordingly, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is 256,000 bacteria after 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{256000} \\]"
