        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total, and everyone plays at least one sport. Some play soccer, some play basketball, and some might play both. I need to find out how many play both sports.\n\nSo, 18 students play soccer and 15 play basketball. If I add those together, that's 18 + 15 = 33. But wait, there are only 30 students in the class. That means that 33 - 30 = 3 students are being counted twice because they play both sports.\n\nMakes sense, right? Because those who play both soccer and basketball are included in both the soccer and basketball counts. So, to find out how many play both, I subtract the total number of students from the sum of soccer and basketball players.\n\nSo, the number of students who play both sports is 3.\n\nWait, is there a formula for this? I think I've seen something like this in set theory. It's about the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula should be:\n\nNumber of students playing soccer or basketball = Number playing soccer + Number playing basketball - Number playing both.\n\nSo, if we let B be the number playing both, then:\n\n30 = 18 + 15 - B\n\nSolving for B: B = 18 + 15 - 30 = 3.\n\nYeah, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nJust to double-check, if 3 students play both sports, then the number playing only soccer would be 18 - 3 = 15, and the number playing only basketball would be 15 - 3 = 12. Adding those up: 15 (only soccer) + 12 (only basketball) + 3 (both) = 30, which matches the total number of students.\n\nSo, the answer is 3 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
