        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 men and 8 women in the room, so altogether there are 12 + 8 = 20 people.\n\nI need to find the probability that if I pick two people at random, both of them are women.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick two people out of 20 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 20 and k = 2.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose two people is C(20, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 2) = 20! / (2!(20 - 2)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 18!) = (20 \u00d7 19) / 2 = 190.\n\nSo, there are 190 possible pairs of people that can be selected.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose two women out of eight.\n\nSo, that's C(8, 2).\n\nCalculating C(8, 2):\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 28.\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to choose two women.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected people are women is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 28 / 190.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n28 \u00f7 2 = 14\n\n190 \u00f7 2 = 95\n\nSo, 14/95.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as a decimal. Let's see:\n\n28 divided by 190 is approximately 0.147368.\n\nSo, the probability is about 0.147 or 14.7%.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way to calculate probability is to consider the chances step by step.\n\nSo, the probability that the first person selected is a woman is the number of women divided by the total number of people, which is 8/20.\n\nThen, given that the first person selected is a woman, the probability that the second person selected is also a woman is the number of remaining women divided by the total remaining people, which is 7/19.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (8/20) \u00d7 (7/19).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 8/20 simplifies to 2/5.\n\nThen, 2/5 \u00d7 7/19 = (2 \u00d7 7) / (5 \u00d7 19) = 14/95.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected people are women is 14/95.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}} \\]"
