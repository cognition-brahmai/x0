        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If you invest $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded quarterly, how much money will you have after 3 years? Okay, let's break this down. I know that compound interest means that the interest earned is added back to the principal, so you earn interest on the interest too. That sounds pretty good for growing your money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"compounded quarterly\" means. Quarterly means four times a year, so the interest is calculated and added back to the principal every three months. The annual interest rate is 5%, but since it's compounded quarterly, I need to find out what the quarterly interest rate is. I think I do that by dividing the annual rate by 4, because there are four quarters in a year. So, 5% divided by 4 is 1.25%. That means each quarter, I'm earning 1.25% interest on the current amount.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many times the interest is compounded over 3 years. Since it's quarterly, and there are 4 quarters in a year, over 3 years that would be 4 times 3, which is 12 times.\n\nSo, the formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years.\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\nP = $10,000\n\nr = 5% or 0.05\n\nn = 4 (since it's compounded quarterly)\n\nt = 3 years\n\nSo, A = 10000 * (1 + 0.05/4)^(4*3)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the quarterly interest rate:\n\n0.05 / 4 = 0.0125\n\nThen, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 0.0125 = 1.0125\n\nNow, raise that to the power of 12 (since 4 quarters * 3 years = 12):\n\n1.0125^12\n\nI'll need to calculate that. Let's see:\n\n1.0125^12 \u2248 1.1607545177\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal:\n\n10000 * 1.1607545177 \u2248 11607.55\n\nSo, after 3 years, you would have approximately $11,607.55.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with P = $10,000\n\nr = 5% or 0.05\n\nn = 4\n\nt = 3\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.05/4)^(4*3)\n\n= 10000 * (1 + 0.0125)^12\n\n= 10000 * (1.0125)^12\n\nNow, calculating (1.0125)^12:\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.0125^12 \u2248 1.1607545177\n\nThen, 10000 * 1.1607545177 = 11607.545177\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's $11,607.55\n\nAlright, that seems correct. So, the investment grows to about $11,607.55 after 3 years with quarterly compounding at 5% annual interest.\n\nBut just to compare, what if it was compounded annually? Let's see.\n\nIf compounded annually, n would be 1.\n\nSo, A = 10000 * (1 + 0.05/1)^(1*3)\n\n= 10000 * (1 + 0.05)^3\n\n= 10000 * (1.05)^3\n\n= 10000 * 1.157625\n\n= $11,576.25\n\nSo, with quarterly compounding, you end up with a little more: $11,607.55 compared to $11,576.25 with annual compounding. That makes sense because the interest is compounded more frequently, so you earn interest on the interest earlier.\n\nWhat if it was compounded monthly? Let's see.\n\nFor monthly compounding, n would be 12.\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.05/12)^(12*3)\n\n= 10000 * (1 + 0.0041666667)^36\n\n= 10000 * (1.0041666667)^36\n\nUsing a calculator, (1.0041666667)^36 \u2248 1.1614718554\n\nSo, A \u2248 10000 * 1.1614718554 = $11,614.72\n\nEven more than quarterly compounding. And if it was compounded daily? Let's assume 365 days a year.\n\nn = 365\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.05/365)^(365*3)\n\n= 10000 * (1 + 0.0001369863)^1095\n\n= 10000 * (1.0001369863)^1095\n\nUsing a calculator, (1.0001369863)^1095 \u2248 1.1618342333\n\nSo, A \u2248 10000 * 1.1618342333 = $11,618.34\n\nSo, the more frequent the compounding, the more interest you earn, but the differences start to get smaller beyond a certain point.\n\nNow, for continuous compounding, the formula is A = P * e^(r*t), where e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.71828.\n\nSo, A = 10000 * e^(0.05*3)\n\n= 10000 * e^0.15\n\nUsing a calculator, e^0.15 \u2248 1.1618342333\n\nSo, A \u2248 10000 * 1.1618342333 = $11,618.34\n\nInteresting, that's the same as the daily compounding approximation. So, continuous compounding would give you the maximum amount possible, which in this case is $11,618.34.\n\nBut back to the original question, which is for quarterly compounding, the amount is $11,607.55.\n\nLet me just check if there's another way to calculate this to confirm.\n\nAnother way to calculate compound interest is to calculate the interest earned each period and add it to the principal.\n\nSo, for quarterly compounding:\n\nInitial principal: $10,000\n\nQuarterly interest rate: 5%/4 = 1.25%\n\nSo, each quarter, the interest earned is the current principal times 1.25%.\n\nLet's calculate it quarter by quarter for 3 years (12 quarters).\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = 10000 * 0.0125 = $125\n\nNew principal = 10000 + 125 = $10,125\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = 10125 * 0.0125 = $126.5625\n\nNew principal = 10125 + 126.5625 = $10,251.5625\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = 10251.5625 * 0.0125 = $128.14453125\n\nNew principal = 10251.5625 + 128.14453125 = $10,379.70703125\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = 10379.70703125 * 0.0125 = $129.746337890625\n\nNew principal = 10379.70703125 + 129.746337890625 = $10,509.453369140625\n\nYear 1 end: approximately $10,509.45\n\nContinuing this for all 12 quarters would be time-consuming, but if I do it for a few more quarters, I can see the pattern.\n\nQuarter 5:\n\nInterest = 10509.453369140625 * 0.0125 = $131.36816711425781\n\nNew principal = 10509.453369140625 + 131.36816711425781 = $10,640.821536254883\n\nQuarter 6:\n\nInterest = 10640.821536254883 * 0.0125 = $133.01026920318604\n\nNew principal = 10640.821536254883 + 133.01026920318604 = $10,773.831805458069\n\nAnd so on, until the 12th quarter.\n\nThis seems to be matching the earlier calculation of approximately $11,607.55 after 12 quarters.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula A = P (1 + r/n)^(n*t) is much quicker and more precise.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after 3 years of investing $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded quarterly, you would have approximately $11,607.55.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11607.55} \\]"
