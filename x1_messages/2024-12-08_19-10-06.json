        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that reads a text file with lines of space-separated integers, calculates the sum of each line, and then writes those sums to a new text file. Sounds straightforward. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to read a text file. Assuming the file is named 'input.txt' and it's in the same directory as my script, I can use the built-in `open` function in Python to read it. Each line in the file contains space-separated integers, so I'll need to split each line by spaces and convert the strings to integers to calculate their sum.\n\nI should also handle any potential errors, like if the file doesn't exist or if there are non-integer values in the file. But for simplicity, let's assume that the file exists and contains only space-separated integers in each line.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Open the input file in read mode.\n\n2. Read each line from the file.\n\n3. Split each line by spaces to get individual integers.\n\n4. Convert the split strings to integers.\n\n5. Calculate the sum of these integers.\n\n6. Store the sums.\n\n7. Open a new text file in write mode.\n\n8. Write each sum to the new file, probably each sum on a new line.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in code.\n\nI'll start by opening the input file. In Python, you can open a file using `open('input.txt', 'r')`, and it's a good practice to use the `with` statement to handle files, as it automatically closes the file after the block of code is executed.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n```\n\nwith open('input.txt', 'r') as file:\n\ndata = file.readlines()\n\n```\n\nThis will read all lines from the file into a list called `data`, where each element is a string representing a line in the file.\n\nNext, for each line in `data`, I need to split the line by spaces and convert each split string to an integer.\n\nI can do this using a list comprehension. For example:\n\n```\n\nsums = []\n\nfor line in data:\n\nnumbers = list(map(int, line.split()))\n\nline_sum = sum(numbers)\n\nsums.append(str(line_sum) + '\\n')\n\n```\n\nHere, `line.split()` splits the line by spaces, `map(int, ...)` converts the split strings to integers, and `sum(...)` calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nI'm storing the sums as strings with a newline character appended to each, so they can be easily written to the output file, each sum on a new line.\n\nThen, I need to write these sums to a new text file, say 'output.txt'. Again, using the `with` statement:\n\n```\n\nwith open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n\nfile.writelines(sums)\n\n```\n\nThis will write each element of the `sums` list to the file, each on a new line.\n\nLet me put this all together into a complete script.\n\nAlso, I should consider handling potential exceptions, like if the file doesn't exist or if there are non-integer values in the file. For now, I'll keep it simple and assume the file is present and contains only integers.\n\nHere's the complete script:\n\n```\n\n# Read the input file\n\nwith open('input.txt', 'r') as file:\n\ndata = file.readlines()\n\n# Calculate sums\n\nsums = []\n\nfor line in data:\n\nnumbers = list(map(int, line.split()))\n\nline_sum = sum(numbers)\n\nsums.append(str(line_sum) + '\\n')\n\n# Write to output file\n\nwith open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n\nfile.writelines(sums)\n\n```\n\nLet me test this with a sample input.\n\nSuppose 'input.txt' contains:\n\n```\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 5 6\n\n7 8 9\n\n```\n\nThen, 'output.txt' should contain:\n\n```\n\n6\n\n15\n\n24\n\n```\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nI can also make this script more flexible by accepting the input and output file names as command-line arguments. That way, it's not hardcoded to 'input.txt' and 'output.txt'.\n\nTo do this, I can use the `sys` module in Python, which allows access to command-line arguments.\n\nHere's how I can modify the script:\n\n```\n\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n\nprint(\"Usage: python script.py input.txt output.txt\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\ninput_file = sys.argv[1]\n\noutput_file = sys.argv[2]\n\nwith open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n\ndata = file.readlines()\n\nsums = []\n\nfor line in data:\n\nnumbers = list(map(int, line.split()))\n\nline_sum = sum(numbers)\n\nsums.append(str(line_sum) + '\\n')\n\nwith open(output_file, 'w') as file:\n\nfile.writelines(sums)\n\n```\n\nNow, the user can specify the input and output file names when running the script from the command line.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\npython script.py input.txt output.txt\n\n```\n\nThis makes the script more versatile.\n\nI should also add some error handling in case the input file doesn't exist or if there are non-integer values in the file.\n\nLet me add try-except blocks to handle these scenarios.\n\nFirst, for file opening:\n\n```\n\ntry:\n\nwith open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n\ndata = file.readlines()\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\nprint(f\"Error: The file '{input_file}' does not exist.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\n```\n\nNext, for converting strings to integers:\n\n```\n\nfor line in data:\n\ntry:\n\nnumbers = list(map(int, line.split()))\n\nline_sum = sum(numbers)\n\nsums.append(str(line_sum) + '\\n')\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Error: The file contains non-integer values.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\n```\n\nThis way, if there are any non-integer values, the script will exit with an error message.\n\nHere's the updated script with error handling:\n\n```\n\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n\nprint(\"Usage: python script.py input.txt output.txt\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\ninput_file = sys.argv[1]\n\noutput_file = sys.argv[2]\n\ntry:\n\nwith open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n\ndata = file.readlines()\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\nprint(f\"Error: The file '{input_file}' does not exist.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nsums = []\n\nfor line in data:\n\ntry:\n\nnumbers = list(map(int, line.split()))\n\nline_sum = sum(numbers)\n\nsums.append(str(line_sum) + '\\n')\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Error: The file contains non-integer values.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nwith open(output_file, 'w') as file:\n\nfile.writelines(sums)\n\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements and handle some common errors.\n\nI can further enhance this script by adding more robust error handling, such as handling empty lines or lines with only spaces.\n\nAlso, I might want to strip whitespace from each line before processing to handle leading or trailing spaces.\n\nLet me adjust the code to strip each line:\n\n```\n\nfor line in data:\n\nline = line.strip()\n\nif line:\n\ntry:\n\nnumbers = list(map(int, line.split()))\n\nline_sum = sum(numbers)\n\nsums.append(str(line_sum) + '\\n')\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Error: The file contains non-integer values.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nelse:\n\n# Skip empty lines\n\ncontinue\n\n```\n\nThis way, any empty lines or lines with only spaces will be skipped.\n\nHere's the final version of the script:\n\n```\n\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n\nprint(\"Usage: python script.py input.txt output.txt\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\ninput_file = sys.argv[1]\n\noutput_file = sys.argv[2]\n\ntry:\n\nwith open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n\ndata = file.readlines()\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\nprint(f\"Error: The file '{input_file}' does not exist.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nsums = []\n\nfor line in data:\n\nline = line.strip()\n\nif line:\n\ntry:\n\nnumbers = list(map(int, line.split()))\n\nline_sum = sum(numbers)\n\nsums.append(str(line_sum) + '\\n')\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Error: The file contains non-integer values.\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nelse:\n\n# Skip empty lines\n\ncontinue\n\nwith open(output_file, 'w') as file:\n\nfile.writelines(sums)\n\n```\n\nThis script should now be able to handle various cases, including missing files and non-integer values, and it writes the sums of each line to a new file as specified.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python script that reads a text file containing lines of space-separated integers, calculates the sum of each line, and writes these sums to a new text file.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading the Input File**: We use Python's `open` function to read the input file in read mode.\n2. **Processing Each Line**: For each line in the file, we split the line by spaces, convert the split strings to integers, and calculate their sum.\n3. **Writing to the Output File**: We write each calculated sum to a new text file, ensuring each sum is on a new line.\n4. **Error Handling**: We handle cases where the input file does not exist or contains non-integer values.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n    print(\"Usage: python script.py input.txt output.txt\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ninput_file = sys.argv[1]\noutput_file = sys.argv[2]\n\ntry:\n    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n        data = file.readlines()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(f\"Error: The file '{input_file}' does not exist.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nsums = []\nfor line in data:\n    line = line.strip()\n    if line:\n        try:\n            numbers = list(map(int, line.split()))\n            line_sum = sum(numbers)\n            sums.append(str(line_sum) + '\\n')\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Error: The file contains non-integer values.\")\n            sys.exit(1)\n    else:\n        # Skip empty lines\n        continue\n\nwith open(output_file, 'w') as file:\n    file.writelines(sums)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Command-Line Arguments**: The script expects two command-line arguments: the input file name and the output file name. It exits with an error message if the correct number of arguments is not provided.\n2. **Reading the Input File**: It attempts to open and read the input file. If the file does not exist, it catches the `FileNotFoundError` and exits with an appropriate error message.\n3. **Processing Each Line**: For each line in the input file:\n   - It strips leading and trailing whitespace.\n   - Skips the line if it is empty.\n   - Splits the line by spaces, converts the split strings to integers, and calculates their sum.\n   - If a line contains non-integer values, it catches the `ValueError` and exits with an error message.\n4. **Writing to the Output File**: It opens the output file in write mode and writes each sum to a new line in the file.\n\nThis approach ensures that the script is robust and handles potential errors gracefully."
