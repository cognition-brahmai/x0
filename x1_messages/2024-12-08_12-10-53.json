        "content": "Golden retrievers are a popular breed of dog known for their friendly and intelligent nature. They are often used as service dogs, therapy dogs, and family pets. While they don't literally \"carry\" anything specific, they are known for carrying toys during playtime or carrying items when trained to do so. In some cases, they may carry items in their mouths as part of their natural behavior or training. It's important to note that the idea of golden retrievers carrying something is more metaphorical and relates to their role and characteristics as a breed."
