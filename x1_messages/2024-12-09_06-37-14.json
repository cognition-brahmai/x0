        "content": "The iconic Hollywood sign, which originally read \"Hollywoodland,\" was first erected in 1923. It was built to advertise a new housing development in the city of Los Angeles, California. The sign was created for the Hollywoodland development, a real estate project that aimed to promote and sell residential lots in the area. Over the years, the sign became an internationally recognized symbol of the American film industry and the city of Los Angeles itself. In 1949, the last four letters (\"land\") were removed, and the sign was restored to read simply \"Hollywood.\" Today, it stands as a landmark and a testament to the enduring legacy of Hollywood and the entertainment industry."
