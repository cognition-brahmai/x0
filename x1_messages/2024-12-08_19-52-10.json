        "content": "Mars comes closest to Earth during its closest approach, also known as opposition, which occurs approximately every 26 months. During this time, Mars and Earth are aligned on the same side of the Sun, with Mars being directly opposite the Sun in the sky. The exact distance varies due to the elliptical orbits of both planets, but the closest approach can bring Mars as near as about 54.6 million kilometers (33.9 million miles) to Earth."
