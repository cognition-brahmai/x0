        "content": "I've got this problem here about a construction company building a new residential complex with 500 apartments. There are three types of apartments: one-bedroom (600 sq ft), two-bedroom (900 sq ft), and three-bedroom (1,200 sq ft). The total area allocated for the apartments is 450,000 sq ft. The task is to determine the optimal number of each type of apartment to maximize living space while maintaining an equal distribution of apartment types. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have to maximize living space, which I think means maximizing the total area occupied by the apartments, but since the total area is fixed at 450,000 sq ft, maybe it's about maximizing the number of larger apartments or something else. But the problem also mentions maintaining an equal distribution of apartment types. Equal distribution probably means that the number of one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom apartments should be as close as possible.\n\nWait, but there are 500 apartments in total. If we want an equal distribution, that would mean dividing 500 by 3, which is approximately 166.67 for each type. But we can't have a fraction of an apartment, so we'll need to have some types with 166 apartments and others with 167. But the problem also mentions maximizing living space, so perhaps we should have more of the larger apartments.\n\nLet me think about the constraints:\n\n1. Total number of apartments: 500\n\n2. Total area: 450,000 sq ft\n\n3. Apartment types:\n\n- One-bedroom: 600 sq ft\n\n- Two-bedroom: 900 sq ft\n\n- Three-bedroom: 1,200 sq ft\n\n4. Equal distribution of apartment types.\n\nI need to find the number of each type of apartment that satisfies these constraints and maximizes living space.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- x = number of one-bedroom apartments\n\n- y = number of two-bedroom apartments\n\n- z = number of three-bedroom apartments\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx + y + z = 500 (total number of apartments)\n\n600x + 900y + 1200z = 450,000 (total area)\n\nWe need to maximize the living space, which is the total area, but since the total area is fixed, maybe it's about maximizing the number of larger apartments while keeping the total area at 450,000 sq ft.\n\nWait, but the total area is fixed, so maximizing living space might not make sense because it's already maximized at 450,000 sq ft. Maybe the goal is to maximize the average space per apartment, which would mean maximizing the number of larger apartments.\n\nBut the problem also mentions maintaining an equal distribution of apartment types. So, there's a trade-off between having an equal number of each type and having more larger apartments.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to maximize the total area given the equal distribution constraint, but since the total area is fixed, maybe it's about finding the distribution that allows us to have as equal numbers as possible without exceeding the total area.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to approach it differently.\n\nFirst, let's try to find out how many apartments of each type we can have if we distribute them equally, and see if that fits within the total area.\n\nAs I thought earlier, 500 divided by 3 is approximately 166.67. So, we can have 166 apartments of two types and 168 of the third type, or some combination like that, to make up 500.\n\nLet's assume we have 166 one-bedroom, 166 two-bedroom, and 168 three-bedroom apartments.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total area for this distribution:\n\nTotal area = (166 * 600) + (166 * 900) + (168 * 1200)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n166 * 600 = 99,600 sq ft\n\n166 * 900 = 149,400 sq ft\n\n168 * 1200 = 201,600 sq ft\n\nAdding them up: 99,600 + 149,400 = 249,000; then 249,000 + 201,600 = 450,600 sq ft\n\nOh, that's 600 sq ft over the allocated area of 450,000 sq ft. So, this distribution doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, let's try 167 one-bedroom, 167 two-bedroom, and 166 three-bedroom apartments.\n\nCalculate the total area:\n\n167 * 600 = 100,200 sq ft\n\n167 * 900 = 150,300 sq ft\n\n166 * 1200 = 199,200 sq ft\n\nTotal area: 100,200 + 150,300 = 250,500; then 250,500 + 199,200 = 449,700 sq ft\n\nThis is 300 sq ft under the allocated area. So, this distribution is closer but still not exact.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to solve this systematically using equations.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y + z = 500\n\n600x + 900y + 1200z = 450,000\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 300:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 1,500\n\nNow, we have the system:\n\nx + y + z = 500\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 1,500\n\nWe can solve this system to find the relationships between x, y, and z.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 500 - y - z\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n2(500 - y - z) + 3y + 4z = 1,500\n\n1,000 - 2y - 2z + 3y + 4z = 1,500\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1,000 + y + 2z = 1,500\n\nSubtract 1,000 from both sides:\n\ny + 2z = 500\n\nSo, y = 500 - 2z\n\nNow, substitute back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 500 - y - z = 500 - (500 - 2z) - z = 500 - 500 + 2z - z = z\n\nSo, x = z\n\nAnd y = 500 - 2z\n\nNow, since x, y, and z must be non-negative integers, we have:\n\nz must be an integer such that y = 500 - 2z \u2265 0\n\nSo, 500 - 2z \u2265 0 \u21d2 2z \u2264 500 \u21d2 z \u2264 250\n\nAlso, z \u2265 0\n\nSimilarly, x = z, so x \u2264 250\n\nAnd y = 500 - 2z\n\nSo, possible values for z are from 0 to 250, and x = z, y = 500 - 2z\n\nNow, the problem mentions maximizing living space while maintaining an equal distribution of apartment types.\n\nGiven that x = z, and y = 500 - 2z, we can express the total area as:\n\nTotal area = 600x + 900y + 1200z = 600z + 900(500 - 2z) + 1200z\n\nSimplify:\n\n600z + 450,000 - 1,800z + 1,200z = 450,000 - 0z = 450,000 sq ft\n\nSo, the total area is always 450,000 sq ft, regardless of the distribution, as long as the equations are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, maximizing living space isn't really a variable here, since it's fixed.\n\nPerhaps the goal is to maximize the number of larger apartments, i.e., three-bedroom apartments, while keeping the distribution as equal as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the distribution that minimizes the difference in the number of each type of apartment.\n\nGiven that x = z and y = 500 - 2z, we can look at the difference between x, y, and z.\n\nSince x = z, the difference between x and z is zero.\n\nThe difference between x and y is |x - y| = |z - (500 - 2z)| = |3z - 500|\n\nSimilarly, the difference between y and z is |y - z| = |500 - 2z - z| = |500 - 3z|\n\nTo minimize the differences, we need to minimize the maximum of |3z - 500| and |500 - 3z|, which are the same.\n\nSo, we need to minimize |3z - 500|\n\nSince z must be an integer between 0 and 250, we can find the value of z that makes 3z as close as possible to 500.\n\nDivide 500 by 3: 500 / 3 \u2248 166.666...\n\nSo, z = 167\n\nLet's check z = 167\n\nThen, x = 167\n\ny = 500 - 2*167 = 500 - 334 = 166\n\nSo, x = 167, y = 166, z = 167\n\nTotal area: 167*600 + 166*900 + 167*1200 = 100,200 + 149,400 + 200,400 = 450,000 sq ft\n\nPerfect, it fits.\n\nAlternatively, z = 166\n\nThen, x = 166\n\ny = 500 - 2*166 = 500 - 332 = 168\n\nTotal area: 166*600 + 168*900 + 166*1200 = 99,600 + 151,200 + 199,200 = 450,000 sq ft\n\nAlso perfect.\n\nSo, both z = 166 and z = 167 are possible, with y being 168 and 166, respectively.\n\nIn terms of equal distribution, both options have two types with 166 and one with 167, or two with 167 and one with 166.\n\nSince the problem mentions maximizing living space, and living space is fixed, perhaps the goal is to have as many three-bedroom apartments as possible, since they are the largest.\n\nIn the first option (z = 167), we have 167 three-bedroom apartments.\n\nIn the second option (z = 166), we have 166 three-bedroom apartments.\n\nSo, the first option has one more three-bedroom apartment.\n\nTherefore, choosing z = 167 would maximize the number of largest apartments while keeping the distribution as equal as possible.\n\nHence, the optimal distribution is:\n\n- One-bedroom: 167 apartments\n\n- Two-bedroom: 166 apartments\n\n- Three-bedroom: 167 apartments\n\nThis maximizes the number of larger apartments while maintaining an equal distribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{One-bedroom: } 167, \\text{ Two-bedroom: } 166, \\text{ Three-bedroom: } 167} \\]"
