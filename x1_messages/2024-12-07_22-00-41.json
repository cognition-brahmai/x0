        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a rectangle. It says that the length is twice its width, and the perimeter is 36 inches. I need to find the area of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, I should recall the formulas for perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) is given by P = 2(length + width), and the area (A) is given by A = length \u00d7 width.\n\nSo, in this case, P = 36 inches, and length (L) is twice the width (W), which means L = 2W.\n\nSubstituting L = 2W into the perimeter formula:\n\nP = 2(L + W) = 2(2W + W) = 2(3W) = 6W.\n\nBut P is 36 inches, so:\n\n6W = 36 inches.\n\nNow, solving for W:\n\nW = 36 inches / 6 = 6 inches.\n\nNow that I have the width, I can find the length:\n\nL = 2W = 2 \u00d7 6 inches = 12 inches.\n\nFinally, the area A = L \u00d7 W = 12 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 72 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Perimeter is 2(L + W), which is 2(12 + 6) = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36 inches, which matches the given perimeter.\n\nSo, the area is indeed 72 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
