        "content": "Let's see. There are 3,000 trees to plant in total. Each person can plant 25 trees per day, and they have 6 days to complete the project. I need to figure out how many people are required to plant all these trees in that time frame.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many trees one person can plant in 6 days. Since each person plants 25 trees per day, in 6 days, one person can plant 25 trees/day times 6 days, which is 150 trees per person.\n\nNow, if one person can plant 150 trees in 6 days, I need to find out how many people are needed to plant 3,000 trees in the same period. To do this, I can divide the total number of trees by the number of trees one person can plant in 6 days.\n\nSo, 3,000 trees divided by 150 trees per person equals 20 people.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If one person can plant 150 trees in 6 days, then 20 people can plant 20 times 150, which is 3,000 trees. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total tree-planting capacity. The group needs to plant 3,000 trees in 6 days. So, the daily planting rate required is 3,000 trees divided by 6 days, which is 500 trees per day.\n\nNow, if each person can plant 25 trees per day, then the number of people needed to plant 500 trees per day is 500 trees per day divided by 25 trees per person per day, which is also 20 people.\n\nBoth methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 20 people are needed to plant 3,000 trees in 6 days, given that each person can plant 25 trees per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
