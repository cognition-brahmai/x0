        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing sports. There are 30 students in total, and among them, 18 play basketball, 20 play soccer, and 8 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play any sport.\n\nSo, there are 18 students who play basketball and 20 who play soccer. If I just add those two numbers together, 18 + 20, that gives me 38. But wait, that's more than the total number of students, which is 30. That can't be right. Oh, I remember, this is because some students play both sports. So, if they're counted in both the basketball and soccer groups, we're double-counting those students.\n\nThe problem says that 8 students play both sports. So, to correct for the double-counting, I need to subtract those 8 students from the total who play at least one sport.\n\nSo, the number of students who play at least one sport would be:\n\n18 (basketball) + 20 (soccer) - 8 (both) = 30 students.\n\nWait, that's exactly equal to the total number of students in the class. So, does that mean that every student plays at least one sport, and therefore, no one doesn't play any sport?\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\nNumber playing basketball + number playing soccer - number playing both.\n\nSo, 18 + 20 - 8 = 30.\n\nYes, that's the same as the total number of students.\n\nTherefore, all 30 students play at least one sport, and thus, the number of students who don't play any sport is 0.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider making a Venn diagram in my mind. There are two circles overlapping. One circle represents basketball players, and the other represents soccer players.\n\nThe basketball circle has 18 students, the soccer circle has 20, and the overlapping area, where students play both, has 8 students.\n\nSo, the part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap with soccer is 18 - 8 = 10 students who play only basketball.\n\nThe part of the soccer circle that doesn't overlap with basketball is 20 - 8 = 12 students who play only soccer.\n\nThen, the overlapping area is 8 students who play both.\n\nSo, total students playing at least one sport is 10 (only basketball) + 12 (only soccer) + 8 (both) = 30 students.\n\nAgain, this matches the total number of students in the class.\n\nTherefore, there are no students who don't play either sport.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B),\n\nwhere A is the set of basketball players, and B is the set of soccer players.\n\nSo, n(A \u222a B) = 18 + 20 - 8 = 30.\n\nSince the total number of students is 30, and all of them are in the union of A and B, meaning all students play at least one of the sports.\n\nHence, the number of students who don't play either sport is 0.\n\nI think this is clear. But to make sure, maybe I can consider it another way.\n\nSuppose I have 30 students.\n\n- 18 play basketball.\n\n- 20 play soccer.\n\n- 8 play both.\n\nSo, the number who play only basketball is 18 - 8 = 10.\n\nThe number who play only soccer is 20 - 8 = 12.\n\nThe number who play both is 8.\n\nTotal playing at least one sport: 10 + 12 + 8 = 30.\n\nTherefore, no students are left who don't play any sport.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the total number of students is 30, and the number playing at least one sport is also 30, then the number not playing any sport is 30 - 30 = 0.\n\nSo, in all these approaches, I'm arriving at the same conclusion that there are no students who don't play either sport.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. It seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that 0 students don't play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
