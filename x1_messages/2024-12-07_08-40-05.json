        "content": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the total number of visitors a new sports complex can handle per day. The complex has a stadium, a swimming pool, and tennis courts. Each part has its own capacity: the stadium can seat 50,000 people, the swimming pool can hold 2,500 visitors at a time, and there are 20 tennis courts available. The question is asking for the total number of visitors the entire complex can handle in a day, assuming each visitor spends an average of 3 hours there, and the complex operates from 8 am to 10 pm daily.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's not just about adding up the capacities of each facility because that would give the total number of people that can be present at any one time, not the total number that can visit in a day. Since visitors spend an average of 3 hours at the facility, and the complex is open for a certain number of hours each day, I can calculate how many groups of visitors can come in throughout the day.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many hours the complex is open each day. It operates from 8 am to 10 pm. So, from 8 am to 10 pm is 14 hours (because 10 pm is 22:00, and 22 - 8 = 14 hours).\n\nNow, if each visitor spends 3 hours at the facility, then in the 14-hour operating period, the number of 3-hour slots available is 14 divided by 3, which is approximately 4.666. But since you can't have a fraction of a group, I might need to consider how to handle that. Maybe it's better to think in terms of continuous flow rather than discrete groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total visitor-hours the complex can accommodate in a day and then divide by the average visit duration to get the total number of visitors.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, calculate the total seating capacity of the complex. That would be the stadium's capacity plus the swimming pool's capacity plus the capacity from the tennis courts.\n\nStadium: 50,000 seats\n\nSwimming pool: 2,500 visitors\n\nTennis courts: Assuming each tennis court can be used by a certain number of people, but the problem doesn't specify. Maybe I need to assume that each tennis court can handle a certain number of visitors simultaneously. Let's assume that each tennis court can accommodate, say, 10 visitors at a time (this is an assumption since the problem doesn't specify). So, 20 courts times 10 visitors each would be 200 visitors.\n\nTotal simultaneous capacity = 50,000 (stadium) + 2,500 (pool) + 200 (tennis) = 52,700 visitors at any given time.\n\nNow, the complex is open for 14 hours a day. So, the total visitor-hours the complex can accommodate in a day is 52,700 visitors/hour times 14 hours, which equals 737,800 visitor-hours.\n\nEach visitor spends an average of 3 hours at the facility. Therefore, the total number of visitors per day would be the total visitor-hours divided by the average visit duration.\n\nTotal visitors per day = 737,800 visitor-hours / 3 hours(visitor) = approximately 245,933.33 visitors.\n\nBut this seems too high. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the stadium isn't meant to be used continuously throughout the day. A stadium with a seating capacity of 50,000 is probably not filled to capacity all day long for various events. Maybe I need to consider that the stadium is used for specific events, and the rest of the facilities are used concurrently.\n\nLet me reconsider.\n\nPerhaps the stadium is used for scheduled events, like sports matches or concerts, which happen at specific times, and the swimming pool and tennis courts are used more continuously.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should calculate the capacity for the stadium based on the number of events it can host in a day, while the swimming pool and tennis courts can be used continuously.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many events the stadium can host in a day. It's probably realistic to assume that a stadium isn't used multiple times in a single day, especially given the time it takes to set up and clear between events.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stadium can be used for multiple events if they are spaced out throughout the day. For example, there could be morning, afternoon, and evening events.\n\nAssuming each event lasts about 3 hours (since visitors spend an average of 3 hours at the facility), then in a 14-hour day, you could have roughly 4 events (since 14 divided by 3 is about 4.666).\n\nSo, if the stadium can host 4 events in a day, each with 50,000 spectators, that would be 200,000 visitors from the stadium alone.\n\nMeanwhile, the swimming pool and tennis courts are used continuously throughout the day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the continuous usage for the swimming pool and tennis courts.\n\nThe swimming pool can hold 2,500 visitors at a time. If it's open for 14 hours, and assuming it's always full, then the total visitor-hours for the pool would be 2,500 visitors/hour * 14 hours = 35,000 visitor-hours.\n\nSimilarly, for the tennis courts, assuming each court can handle 10 visitors at a time, total capacity is 200 visitors. So, 200 visitors/hour * 14 hours = 2,800 visitor-hours.\n\nNow, total continuous visitor-hours from pool and tennis courts: 35,000 + 2,800 = 37,800 visitor-hours.\n\nEach visitor spends an average of 3 hours, so the total number of visitors from pool and tennis courts would be 37,800 / 3 = 12,600 visitors.\n\nAdding the stadium visitors: 200,000 + 12,600 = 212,600 visitors per day.\n\nBut this still seems quite high. Maybe my assumption about the stadium hosting 4 events per day is unrealistic. It's unlikely that a stadium can host multiple events in a single day due to setup times and the duration of events.\n\nPerhaps a more realistic assumption is that the stadium hosts only one event per day. In that case, stadium visitors would be 50,000.\n\nThen, adding the pool and tennis courts visitors: 50,000 + 12,600 = 62,600 visitors per day.\n\nThis seems more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stadium can host two events per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, assuming there's enough time between them to prepare the stadium.\n\nIf two events, then 100,000 stadium visitors.\n\nTotal visitors: 100,000 + 12,600 = 112,600.\n\nStill, I'm not entirely sure about the stadium usage. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the total capacity of the complex at any given time, which is 52,700 visitors.\n\nIf the complex is operating at full capacity all day, then the total visitor-hours would be 52,700 visitors/hour * 14 hours = 737,800 visitor-hours.\n\nGiven that each visitor spends 3 hours at the facility, the total number of visitors per day would be 737,800 / 3 \u2248 245,933 visitors.\n\nBut this assumes that the entire complex is operating at full capacity all day, which might not be realistic, especially considering that the stadium could not be filled to capacity all day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stadium is not intended for continuous use throughout the day, and the other facilities are.\n\nIn that case, perhaps only the swimming pool and tennis courts are providing continuous visitor capacity, while the stadium is used for specific events.\n\nSo, let's calculate the visitors based on that.\n\nFirst, the stadium: if it's used for one event per day with 50,000 spectators.\n\nSwimming pool and tennis courts: combined continuous capacity of 2,500 + 200 = 2,700 visitors at a time.\n\nOver 14 hours, if always full, that's 2,700 * 14 = 37,800 visitor-hours.\n\nWith each visitor spending 3 hours, that's 37,800 / 3 = 12,600 visitors from pool and tennis courts.\n\nTotal visitors per day: 50,000 (stadium) + 12,600 = 62,600 visitors.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable estimate.\n\nAlternatively, if the stadium is used for two events per day, total stadium visitors would be 100,000.\n\nTotal visitors: 100,000 + 12,600 = 112,600.\n\nGiven that managing two major events in a stadium in a single day seems logistically challenging, I'll stick with one event per day.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is approximately 62,600 visitors per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62600} \\]"
