        "content": "So there's this problem here. The city has a population of 500,000 people, and 60% of them own a smartphone. I need to find out how many smartphones there are in the city.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems straightforward: I have to find 60% of 500,000. But let me break it down to make sure I get it right.\n\nI know that \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 60% is the same as 60 per 100 or 60/100. In decimal form, that's 0.60.\n\nSo, to find 60% of 500,000, I can multiply 500,000 by 0.60.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of smartphones = 500,000 * 0.60\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication.\n\n500,000 times 0.60.\n\nWell, 500,000 times 0.60 is the same as 500,000 times 60 divided by 100.\n\nWait, or more simply, 500,000 times 0.60 is 500,000 times 0.6, which is 300,000.\n\nSo, there are 300,000 smartphones in the city.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nAnother way is to find what 1% of 500,000 is and then multiply by 60.\n\n1% of 500,000 is 5,000 (because 500,000 divided by 100 is 5,000).\n\nSo, 60% would be 60 times 5,000, which is also 300,000.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait a minute, but does everyone own only one smartphone? The question says \"own a smartphone,\" but maybe some people own more than one.\n\nHmm.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify whether people own multiple smartphones or just one. It probably assumes that each person owns one smartphone.\n\nSo, if 60% of the population owns a smartphone, and each of those people owns one smartphone, then the number of smartphones should be equal to the number of people who own them.\n\nTherefore, 300,000 smartphones.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it. Maybe some people own multiple smartphones. The problem doesn't say anything about that, so I think it's safe to assume that each smartphone owner has one smartphone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some smartphone owners have lost their phones or have phones that are not in use, but I think for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that each owner has one active smartphone.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether there are smartphones in the city that are not owned by the residents. For example, maybe there are smartphones owned by businesses or tourists. But again, the problem specifies \"people\" and the population is given as 500,000 people, so likely it's referring to the residents.\n\nSo, my final answer is 300,000 smartphones.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nLet me see: \"how many smartphones are there in the city?\"\n\nIf some smartphones are owned by outsiders who are just visiting, should I include those in the count?\n\nProbably not, because the problem says \"own a smartphone,\" which implies ownership by the residents.\n\nAlso, if there are smartphones that are not owned by any person, like perhaps smartphones in government facilities or businesses, should I include those?\n\nThe problem specifically says \"people,\" so likely it's referring to personal ownership.\n\nTherefore, sticking with my initial calculation: 300,000 smartphones.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me do the calculation again.\n\n500,000 times 0.60 is 300,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of smartphones in the city is 300,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300000} \\]\n"
