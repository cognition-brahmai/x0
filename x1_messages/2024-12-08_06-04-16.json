        "content": "So, there are 5 red cars, 3 blue cars, and 2 green cars in the parking lot. That means there are a total of 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 cars.\n\nI need to find the probability that if I pick two cars at random, both of them are red.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to pick two cars out of 10 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 2.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 2 cars out of 10 is C(10, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 possible pairs of cars that can be chosen from the 10 cars.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 red cars out of the 5 red cars.\n\nAgain, using the combination formula, C(5, 2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose 2 red cars from the 5 red cars.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both cars picked are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 10 / 45.\n\nSimplifying that fraction, 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 45 divided by 5 is 9, so it's 2/9.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of sequential probabilities.\n\nThe probability that the first car picked is red is 5 out of 10, since there are 5 red cars out of 10 total cars. So, 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nThen, given that the first car picked was red, there are now 4 red cars left and 9 cars in total.\n\nSo, the probability that the second car is also red is 4/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both cars are red is (1/2) \u00d7 (4/9) = 4/18, which simplifies to 2/9.\n\nThat matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}} \\]"
