        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 balls in total, some black and some white. When you pick 2 balls at once, the probability that both are black is 1/3. I need to find out how many black balls are in the box.\n\nFirst, I should recall how to calculate probabilities for selecting multiple items. Since the balls are picked at once, the order doesn't matter, so I'll be dealing with combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items, and \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 12 is:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = 66\n\\]\n\nNow, let's denote the number of black balls as \\(b\\). Then, the number of ways to choose 2 black balls from \\(b\\) black balls is:\n\n\\[\nC(b, 2) = \\frac{b!}{2!(b - 2)!} = \\frac{b(b - 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that both balls picked are black is the number of ways to choose 2 black balls divided by the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls. According to the problem, this probability is 1/3. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(b, 2)}{C(12, 2)} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values I have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{b(b - 1)}{2}}{66} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b(b - 1)}{132} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, cross-multiplying to solve for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb(b - 1) = \\frac{132}{3} = 44\n\\]\n\nSo, I have the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - b - 44 = 0\n\\]\n\nI'll solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-44)}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 176}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{177}}{2}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, the square root of 177 isn't a perfect square. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting from the probability equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(b, 2)}{C(12, 2)} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{b(b - 1)}{2}}{66} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b(b - 1)}{132} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb(b - 1) = 44\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb^2 - b - 44 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, seems correct. But I need integer solutions because the number of balls can't be a fraction or irrational. Maybe I need to consider that \\(b\\) must be an integer and see which integer values satisfy the equation.\n\nLet's try plugging in some integer values for \\(b\\) to see if any of them satisfy the equation \\(b^2 - b - 44 = 0\\).\n\nLet's try \\(b = 7\\):\n\n\\[\n7^2 - 7 - 44 = 49 - 7 - 44 = -2 \\quad \\text{(too low)}\n\\]\n\n\\(b = 8\\):\n\n\\[\n64 - 8 - 44 = 12 \\quad \\text{(too high)}\n\\]\n\n\\(b = 7\\) is a bit low, and \\(b = 8\\) is a bit high. Maybe there's no integer solution, which would be strange for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the problem. Let me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the probability of picking two black balls without replacement. The probability of picking the first black ball is \\(b/12\\), and then picking another black ball is \\((b - 1)/11\\), since one black ball has already been picked.\n\nSo, the joint probability would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{12} \\times \\frac{b - 1}{11} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b(b - 1)}{132} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So, I'm back to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - b - 44 = 0\n\\]\n\nSince the quadratic doesn't factor nicely, and the discriminant (\\(1 + 176 = 177\\)) isn't a perfect square, it suggests that there isn't an integer solution for \\(b\\), which is strange because the number of balls should be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the total number of balls isn't 12, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. But assuming the problem is correctly stated, perhaps the number of black balls isn't an integer, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think about the possible integer values for \\(b\\) and see which one gets closest to the probability of 1/3.\n\nLet's try \\(b = 6\\):\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = 15 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{15}{66} \\approx 0.227 \\quad \\text{(which is about } \\frac{1}{4.4}\\text{)}\n\\]\n\nToo low.\n\n\\(b = 7\\):\n\n\\[\nC(7, 2) = 21 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{21}{66} \\approx 0.318 \\quad \\text{(about } \\frac{1}{3.14}\\text{)}\n\\]\n\nClose, but a bit low.\n\n\\(b = 8\\):\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = 28 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{28}{66} \\approx 0.424 \\quad \\text{(about } \\frac{2}{4.71}\\text{)}\n\\]\n\nToo high.\n\nSo, \\(b = 7\\) gives a probability closer to 1/3 than \\(b = 6\\) or \\(b = 8\\). Maybe the problem expects me to round to the nearest integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of balls is not 12, but that's what the problem states.\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to consider that the probability is exactly 1/3, and see if there's a way to make that work with integer values.\n\nSo, set up the equation again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(b, 2)}{C(12, 2)} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{b(b - 1)}{2}}{66} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b(b - 1)}{132} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb(b - 1) = 44\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(b^2 - b - 44 = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 176}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{177}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{177}\\) is approximately 13.304, then:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{1 + 13.304}{2} \\approx 7.152\n\\]\n\nWhich is not an integer. But the number of balls must be an integer. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem setup or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for a non-integer number of black balls, which doesn't make sense practically, but mathematically, it could be possible. However, in the context of counting balls, it's impractical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the probability is approximate, and choose the closest integer value. In that case, \\(b = 7\\) gives a probability of 21/66 \u2248 0.318, which is close to 1/3 \u2248 0.333.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to reconsider the total number of balls. Wait, the problem says there are 12 balls, so I can't change that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the picks are with replacement, but the problem says \"pick 2 balls at once,\" which implies without replacement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the box contains other colors, but the problem says some black and some white, so only two colors.\n\nWait, the problem says \"some black and some white,\" so maybe there are other colors, but it's implied that only black and white are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the picks are with replacement, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me try assuming picks with replacement.\n\nIf picks are with replacement, then the probability of both being black is \\((b/12)^2 = 1/3\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{b}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b^2}{144} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb^2 = 48\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb = \\sqrt{48} \\approx 6.928\n\\]\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis reinforces that perhaps the problem expects a non-integer solution, which is impractical for counting balls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the total number of balls is different, but assuming the problem is correctly stated, perhaps I need to round to the nearest integer.\n\nGiven that \\(b \\approx 7.152\\), rounding to 7 black balls.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\nIf \\(b = 7\\), then \\(C(7, 2) = 21\\), and total \\(C(12, 2) = 66\\), so probability is \\(21/66 = 7/22 \\approx 0.318\\), which is about 1/3.206, close but not exactly 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, if \\(b = 8\\), \\(C(8, 2) = 28\\), probability \\(28/66 \\approx 0.424\\), which is higher than 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, \\(b = 6\\), \\(C(6, 2) = 15\\), probability \\(15/66 \\approx 0.227\\), which is lower than 1/3.\n\nSo, \\(b = 7\\) is closer to 1/3 than \\(b = 6\\) or \\(b = 8\\).\n\nTherefore, the best integer solution is \\(b = 7\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nLet me consider setting up the equation differently.\n\nGiven that the probability of both balls being black is 1/3, and using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(b, 2)}{C(12, 2)} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{b(b - 1)}{2}}{\\frac{12 \\times 11}{2}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b(b - 1)}{12 \\times 11} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb(b - 1) = 12 \\times 11 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 44\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\(b^2 - b - 44 = 0\\), which leads to the same quadratic equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the probability in terms of sequential events.\n\nThe probability of picking the first black ball is \\(b/12\\), and given that the first ball is black, the probability of picking another black ball is \\((b - 1)/11\\).\n\nSo, the joint probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{12} \\times \\frac{b - 1}{11} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b(b - 1)}{132} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb(b - 1) = 44\n\\]\n\nSame equation as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider testing integer values of \\(b\\) to see which one makes the probability closest to 1/3.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\n\\(b\\) | \\(C(b, 2)\\) | Probability\n\n6 | 15 | 15/66 \u2248 0.227\n\n7 | 21 | 21/66 \u2248 0.318\n\n8 | 28 | 28/66 \u2248 0.424\n\n9 | 36 | 36/66 \u2248 0.545\n\n10 | 45 | 45/66 \u2248 0.682\n\n11 | 55 | 55/66 \u2248 0.833\n\n12 | 66 | 66/66 = 1\n\nNone of these probabilities are exactly 1/3, but \\(b = 7\\) is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the exact solution, acknowledging that \\(b\\) is not an integer.\n\nIn that case, \\(b = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{177}}{2} \\approx 7.152\\), but again, that doesn't make practical sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the total number of balls is not 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some balls are neither black nor white, but the problem says \"some black and some white,\" implying that all balls are either black or white.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using a different approach, such as using expected values or conditional probabilities, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and the probability should be different to yield an integer number of black balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the picks are with replacement, but that leads to a non-integer number as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by setting up and solving the quadratic equation, accepting a non-integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to recognize that there is no integer solution and conclude that the problem has no valid answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the total number of balls is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is meant to be different, such as 1/6 or 1/4, which might yield an integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the balls are picked one at a time, but that should not affect the combination approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different formula or approach that should be used here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider generating functions or other combinatorial tools, but that seems overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of black balls is such that the probability is exactly 1/3, and accept a non-integer number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to demonstrate that sometimes real-world constraints (like integer counts) don't align with mathematical expectations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the box contains fewer or more balls to make the numbers work out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the probability is approximate, and choose the closest integer value.\n\nGiven all that, I think the intended answer is that there are 7 black balls in the box, acknowledging that the probability is approximately 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
