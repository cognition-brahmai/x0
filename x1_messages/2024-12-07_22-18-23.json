        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a bag with 10 red balls and 20 blue balls, and I need to find the probability of drawing a red ball without looking. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is drawing a red ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the bag.\n\nSo, the formula for probability is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Red Balls}}{\\text{Total Number of Balls}} \\]\n\nNow, from the problem, I know there are 10 red balls and 20 blue balls. So, the total number of balls is 10 + 20, which is 30.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{10}{30} \\]\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the probability is one-third.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other factor that could affect the probability? For example, is the bag being drawn from with or without replacement? The problem says \"without looking,\" which suggests it's a random draw, and there's no mention of replacement, so I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlso, probabilities are often expressed as decimals or percentages. One-third as a decimal is approximately 0.333, and as a percentage, that's about 33.3%. So, there's roughly a 33.3% chance of drawing a red ball.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also think about it in terms of odds. The odds in favor of drawing a red ball would be the number of red balls divided by the number of blue balls, which is 10 divided by 20, or 1 to 2. But odds are different from probability, so I should stick with the probability formula.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for every red ball, there are two blue balls. So, out of every three balls, one is red. Therefore, the probability should be one-third, which matches my calculation.\n\nI think that's solid. No holes in my reasoning here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
