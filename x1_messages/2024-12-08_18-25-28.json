        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is ((3^2 - 4) * 5 + 6) / 2. First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting inside the parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate the exponent: 3^2 = 9.\n\nNow the expression is ((9 - 4) * 5 + 6) / 2.\n\n2. Next, subtraction inside the parentheses: 9 - 4 = 5.\n\nNow it's (5 * 5 + 6) / 2.\n\n3. Multiplication inside the parentheses: 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nNow it's (25 + 6) / 2.\n\n4. Addition inside the parentheses: 25 + 6 = 31.\n\nNow it's 31 / 2.\n\n5. Finally, division: 31 / 2 = 15.5.\n\nSo, the answer is 15.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15.5} \\]"
