        "content": "Implementing a function in Golang to reverse a string without using any built-in functions or libraries involves manipulating the string character by character. Since strings in Go are immutable, we'll need to convert the string into a slice of runes to handle potential multi-byte characters correctly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc reverseString(s string) string {\n\trunes := []rune(s)\n\tlength := len(runes)\n\tfor i := 0; i < length/2; i++ {\n\t\trunes[i], runes[length-1-i] = runes[length-1-i], runes[i]\n\t}\n\treturn string(runes)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tinput := \"Hello, \u4e16\u754c\"\n\treversed := reverseString(input)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Original:\", input)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Reversed:\", reversed)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Conversion to Runes:** Strings in Go are sequences of bytes, but they can contain Unicode characters that might be represented by multiple bytes. By converting the string to a slice of runes, we ensure that each character, including multi-byte characters, is handled correctly.\n\n2. **Reversing the Slice:** We use a simple loop to swap characters from the beginning and end of the slice, moving towards the center. This is done by iterating from the start to the midpoint of the slice and swapping each rune with its corresponding rune from the end.\n\n3. **Conversion Back to String:** After reversing the slice of runes, we convert it back to a string using the `string()` function.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function works correctly with any string, including those containing special characters or non-ASCII characters."
