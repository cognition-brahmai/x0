It's like, when you put it on your tongue, it's all smooth and creamy, and then it just kind of disappears, leaving this really yummy, slightly sweet flavor behind. It's hard to explain, but it's one of those things where once you try it, you're like, \"Oh, man, I need more of this!\" It's especially good after a meal or when you're just craving something indulgent. Trust me, it's a treat that never gets old. How 'bout you, have you tried it?"
