The CPU handles general computing tasks, while the GPU is\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f62\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5982\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6e32\u67d3\u3002\n\n- **Memory (RAM):** Temporary storage that allows the phone to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. More RAM generally means smoother multitasking and faster app switching.\n\n- **Storage (ROM):** Permanent storage for apps, media, and personal files. Modern smartphones use flash memory, which is fast and durable. Some phones support expandable storage via microSD cards.\n\n- **Display:** The screen where users interact with the device. Displays vary in size, resolution, and technology (e.g., LCD, OLED). Higher resolutions provide sharper images, and different technologies offer varying levels of brightness, contrast, and energy efficiency.\n\n- **Battery:** Powers the smartphone and its components. Batteries are usually lithium-ion and have varying capacities, affecting how long the phone can operate between charges.\n\n- **Camera(s):** Capture photos and videos. Smartphones often have multiple cameras with different capabilities, such as wide-angle, telephoto, and ultra-wide lenses, along with features like optical zoom and image stabilization.\n\n- **Operating System (OS):** The software that manages hardware and software resources and provides common services for apps. Major smartphone OSes include Android and iOS, each offering different user interfaces and ecosystems.\n\n- **Connectivity:** Includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, and cellular networks (like 4G or 5G). These allow the phone to connect to the internet, other devices, and services.\n\n- **Sensors:** Various sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, fingerprint scanners, and ambient light sensors enhance the user experience by providing data about the phone's environment and usage.\n\n- **Audio:** Components for producing sound, including speakers and microphones, which are used for calls, media playback, and voice assistants.\n\nEach of these components works together to provide the comprehensive functionality that makes smartphones essential in today's world."
