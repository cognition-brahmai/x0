        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of students, and they play either basketball, soccer, or both. We're given that 20 students play basketball, 25 play soccer, and 30 play either one of the games or both. We need to find out how many students play both games.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. It's a formula that helps us find the total number of elements in the union of two sets by adding the number in each set and then subtracting the number in their intersection. In formula terms, for two sets A and B:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nHere, |A \u222a B| is the number of students who play either basketball or soccer or both, which is given as 30. |A| is the number who play basketball, which is 20, and |B| is the number who play soccer, which is 25. We need to find |A \u2229 B|, the number who play both.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n30 = 20 + 25 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nLet's solve for |A \u2229 B|:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 20 + 25 - 30\n|A \u2229 B| = 45 - 30\n|A \u2229 B| = 15\n\nSo, 15 students play both basketball and soccer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's think about it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Only basketball players: B_only\n\n- Only soccer players: S_only\n\n- Both games players: Both\n\nWe know that:\n\nB_only + Both = 20 (since 20 play basketball)\n\nS_only + Both = 25 (since 25 play soccer)\n\nAnd the total number of students who play at least one game is 30:\n\nB_only + S_only + Both = 30\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1. B_only + Both = 20\n\n2. S_only + Both = 25\n\n3. B_only + S_only + Both = 30\n\nWe need to find Both.\n\nLet\u2019s solve these equations step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nB_only = 20 - Both\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nS_only = 25 - Both\n\nNow, plug these into equation 3:\n\n(20 - Both) + (25 - Both) + Both = 30\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 - Both + 25 - Both + Both = 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n45 - Both = 30\n\nNow, solve for Both:\n\n-Both = 30 - 45\n-Both = -15\nBoth = 15\n\nSo again, we get 15 students play both games.\n\nHmm, is there another approach I can take to confirm this?\n\nLet\u2019s consider Venn diagrams. If we have two circles overlapping, one for basketball and one for soccer, the overlapping area represents students who play both.\n\nThe basketball circle has 20 students, but this includes those who play only basketball and those who play both. Similarly, the soccer circle has 25 students, including those who play only soccer and those who play both.\n\nThe total number of students who play at least one game is 30.\n\nSo, if we add the number in the basketball circle and the soccer circle, we get 20 + 25 = 45. But wait, that's more than the total number of students who play at least one game (30). That's because the students who play both games are being counted twice, once in each circle.\n\nTo correct this, we need to subtract the number of students who are counted in both circles, which is the number who play both games.\n\nSo, 20 (basketball) + 25 (soccer) - Both = 30\n\nAgain, that's:\n\n45 - Both = 30\n\nSo, Both = 45 - 30 = 15\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem that might give a different perspective?\n\nLet\u2019s think about the number of students who play only one game.\n\nThe number who play only basketball is 20 - Both.\n\nThe number who play only soccer is 25 - Both.\n\nThe total number of students who play at least one game is the sum of those who play only basketball, only soccer, and both:\n\n(20 - Both) + (25 - Both) + Both = 30\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 + 25 - Both = 30\n\n45 - Both = 30\n\nBoth = 15\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nWait, maybe I can use probabilities or ratios, but that seems unnecessary here because we're dealing with exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships.\n\nLet\u2019s let x be the number of students who play both games.\n\nThen, the number who play only basketball is 20 - x.\n\nThe number who play only soccer is 25 - x.\n\nAnd the total number who play at least one game is (20 - x) + (25 - x) + x = 30.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 - x + 25 - x + x = 30\n\n45 - x = 30\n\n-x = 30 - 45\n\n-x = -15\n\nx = 15\n\nOnce again, x = 15.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this problem, I end up with 15 students playing both games.\n\nLet me consider if there could be any other interpretation of the problem that might lead to a different answer.\n\nIs there a possibility that some students don't play any games, but the problem says that some play only basketball, some play only soccer, and some play both, and the total who play at least one game is 30.\n\nIf there are students who don't play any games, they wouldn't be included in the 30, so that shouldn't affect our calculation for those who play both games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers given include students who play both games in each category.\n\nWait, in the initial statement, it says \"some students play only basketball, some play only soccer, and some play both games.\"\n\nThen, it gives numbers: 20 play basketball, 25 play soccer, and 30 play either game or both.\n\nSo, the 20 who play basketball include those who play only basketball and those who play both.\n\nSimilarly, the 25 who play soccer include those who play only soccer and those who play both.\n\nAnd the 30 is the total number who play at least one of the games.\n\nSo, our earlier approaches account for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of set theory.\n\nLet B be the set of basketball players, S be the set of soccer players.\n\nWe know that |B| = 20, |S| = 25, and |B \u222a S| = 30.\n\nWe need to find |B \u2229 S|.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|B \u222a S| = |B| + |S| - |B \u2229 S|\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n30 = 20 + 25 - |B \u2229 S|\n\nSo, |B \u2229 S| = 20 + 25 - 30 = 15\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nI think it's clear that the number of students who play both games is 15.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any constraints or additional information that might change this.\n\nFor example, is it possible that the number of students who play both games is higher than 15?\n\nWell, if we assume that all 20 basketball players also play soccer, that would mean 20 students play both, but then the total number of soccer players would be 25, which includes these 20 who play both and an additional 5 who play only soccer.\n\nSo, the total number who play at least one game would be 20 (both) + 5 (only soccer) = 25, but the problem states it's 30.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if fewer than 15 play both games, say 10, then:\n\nNumber who play only basketball: 20 - 10 = 10\n\nNumber who play only soccer: 25 - 10 = 15\n\nTotal playing at least one game: 10 + 15 + 10 = 35, which is more than 30.\n\nThat doesn't fit.\n\nIf we try 15 playing both:\n\nOnly basketball: 20 - 15 = 5\n\nOnly soccer: 25 - 15 = 10\n\nTotal: 5 + 10 + 15 = 30, which matches the given total.\n\nSo, any number other than 15 doesn't satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible solution is that 15 students play both games.\n\nI don't see any other logical approach that would lead to a different answer.\n\nHence, the final answer is 15 students play both basketball and soccer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
