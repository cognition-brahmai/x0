        "content": "So the factory makes 5,000 widgets every day, and it works 20 days each month. We want to find out how many widgets it makes in a whole year, assuming there are 12 months. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many widgets are produced in one month. Since the factory produces 5,000 widgets each day and works 20 days a month, I can multiply these two numbers to get the monthly production.\n\nSo, 5,000 widgets/day \u00d7 20 days/month = 100,000 widgets/month.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, to find out the annual production, I need to calculate the total for 12 months.\n\nSo, 100,000 widgets/month \u00d7 12 months/year = 1,200,000 widgets/year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with daily production: 5,000 widgets/day.\n\nNumber of working days per month: 20 days.\n\nSo, monthly production: 5,000 \u00d7 20 = 100,000 widgets.\n\nAnnual production: 100,000 \u00d7 12 = 1,200,000 widgets.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Another way to think about it is to calculate the total number of working days in a year and then multiply by the daily production.\n\nNumber of working days per month: 20.\n\nNumber of months: 12.\n\nTotal working days in a year: 20 \u00d7 12 = 240 days.\n\nNow, multiply the total working days by daily production: 240 days \u00d7 5,000 widgets/day = 1,200,000 widgets/year.\n\nOkay, both methods give the same result, which is a good sign. I can be confident that the factory produces 1,200,000 widgets in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200000} \\]"
