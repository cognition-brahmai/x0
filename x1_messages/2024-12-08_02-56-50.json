        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a group of people, 70% have brown eyes, and 45% have blonde hair. If 30% of the people have both brown eyes and blonde hair, what percentage of the people with brown eyes also have blonde hair?\n\nOkay, so I need to find out what percentage of people who have brown eyes also have blonde hair. That sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of one event happening given that another event has already happened.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let E be the event that a person has brown eyes.\n\n- Let H be the event that a person has blonde hair.\n\nSo, from the problem:\n\n- P(E) = 70% or 0.70\n\n- P(H) = 45% or 0.45\n\n- P(E and H) = 30% or 0.30\n\nI need to find the percentage of people with brown eyes who also have blonde hair, which is P(H|E), the probability of having blonde hair given that they have brown eyes.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(H|E) = P(E and H) / P(E)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(H|E) = 0.30 / 0.70 = 0.428571...\n\nTo express this as a percentage, I multiply by 100:\n\n0.428571... * 100 \u2248 42.86%\n\nSo, approximately 42.86% of the people with brown eyes also have blonde hair.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says \"what percentage of the people with brown eyes also have blonde hair,\" which aligns with P(H|E). I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this in terms of sets. Suppose there are 100 people in the group for simplicity.\n\n- 70 people have brown eyes.\n\n- 45 people have blonde hair.\n\n- 30 people have both brown eyes and blonde hair.\n\nSo, among the 70 people with brown eyes, 30 also have blonde hair. Therefore, the percentage is (30 / 70) * 100 = 42.86%, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider the inclusion-exclusion principle to verify the consistency of the given percentages.\n\nThe total percentage of people with either brown eyes or blonde hair or both is:\n\nP(E or H) = P(E) + P(H) - P(E and H) = 0.70 + 0.45 - 0.30 = 0.85 or 85%\n\nSince this is less than 100%, it's possible, assuming that some people may have neither brown eyes nor blonde hair.\n\nGiven that, my calculation for the conditional probability seems consistent.\n\nI think 42.86% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42.86\\%} \\]"
