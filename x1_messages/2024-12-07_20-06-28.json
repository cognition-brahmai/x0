        "content": "So I've got this problem here: 15 workers can assemble a product in 3 hours, and I need to figure out how long it would take for 60 workers to do the same job, assuming they all work at the same rate. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time they take to complete the job. I think this is a case of inverse proportion, where if you have more workers, the time taken to complete the job decreases, provided they all work at the same rate.\n\nLet me try to break it down. If 15 workers take 3 hours, then the total amount of work can be thought of as \"worker-hours.\" So, the total work required to assemble the product is 15 workers times 3 hours, which is 45 worker-hours.\n\nNow, if I have 60 workers, and the total work required is still 45 worker-hours, then the time taken would be the total work divided by the number of workers. So, time = total work / number of workers.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: time = 45 worker-hours / 60 workers = 0.75 hours.\n\nWait a minute, 0.75 hours is the same as 45 minutes. So, 60 workers would take 45 minutes to assemble the product.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If 15 workers take 3 hours, then increasing the number of workers by a factor of 4 (from 15 to 60) should decrease the time by a factor of 4, assuming the work is evenly distributed and there are no constraints like space or resources.\n\nSo, 3 hours divided by 4 is indeed 0.75 hours, or 45 minutes. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the work rate per worker. If 15 workers take 3 hours, then the work rate for the group is 1 product per 3 hours. So, the work rate per worker would be 1 product divided by (15 workers times 3 hours), which is 1/(45) products per worker-hour.\n\nBut that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should stick with the first method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of how much work each worker does per hour. If 15 workers take 3 hours to complete the job, then the work done per hour by the group is 1/3 of the product.\n\nSo, the combined work rate is 1/3 product per hour.\n\nThen, the work rate per worker is (1/3)/15 = 1/45 product per worker-hour.\n\nNow, if you have 60 workers, each working at 1/45 product per hour, then the combined work rate is 60 * (1/45) = 60/45 = 4/3 products per hour.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because they're only assembling one product. Maybe I need to adjust my thinking here.\n\nActually, the combined work rate of 60 workers would be 60/15 times the original work rate, since 60 is 4 times 15. The original work rate is 1 product per 3 hours, so 4 times that rate would be 4 products per 3 hours, or 4/3 products per hour.\n\nBut since they're only making one product, the time taken would be the time required to complete one product at the rate of 4/3 products per hour.\n\nSo, time = 1 product / (4/3 products per hour) = 3/4 hours, which is again 45 minutes.\n\nOkay, so no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 45 minutes as the answer.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. For example, is there a limit to how many workers can work on the product simultaneously without getting in each other's way? Or are there any resources that might become bottlenecked with more workers?\n\nThe problem says to assume they work at the same rate and don't mention any constraints, so I think it's safe to proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the task is parallelizable. That is, can the job be divided among more workers such that they can work independently on their parts? In assembly line processes, often the work can be divided, so more workers could indeed speed up the process.\n\nGiven that, my initial approach seems valid.\n\nSo, to summarize: the total work is 45 worker-hours (15 workers * 3 hours). With 60 workers, the time taken is 45 worker-hours / 60 workers = 0.75 hours, or 45 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it would take 60 workers 45 minutes to assemble the same product.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
