        "content": "So I've got this problem here about marbles in a bag. There are 3 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 7 green marbles. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue marble at random. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue marble, and the total outcomes are all the marbles in the bag.\n\nLet me first find out the total number of marbles. There are 3 red, 5 blue, and 7 green. So, total marbles = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 marbles.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red marbles plus the number of blue marbles, since I want either red or blue. So, favorable outcomes = 3 (red) + 5 (blue) = 8 marbles.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of picking either red or blue is P = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 8/15.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of addition rule in probability. The addition rule says that the probability of A or B happening is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). But in this case, since picking a red marble and picking a blue marble are mutually exclusive events (you can't pick both at the same time), P(A and B) is 0. So, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue).\n\nLet's calculate that. P(red) = 3/15, P(blue) = 5/15. So, P(red or blue) = 3/15 + 5/15 = 8/15. Same as before.\n\nGood, it matches. So, the probability is 8/15.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider the probability of not picking a green marble, since the only other options are red and blue. The number of green marbles is 7, so the probability of picking a green marble is 7/15. Therefore, the probability of not picking green (which means picking either red or blue) is 1 - 7/15 = 8/15. Again, the same answer.\n\nAlright, seems consistent. I think 8/15 is the correct probability of picking either a red or a blue marble from the bag.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{15}} \\]"
