        "content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a theme park trying to figure out how many staff members they need for different areas based on visitor patterns. The park gets 15,000 visitors a day on average, and these visitors split into three main groups: those going on rides, attending shows, and participating in other activities. The percentages are 60% for rides, 30% for shows, and 10% for other activities.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many visitors are in each category. For rides:\n\n15,000 visitors * 60% = 15,000 * 0.6 = 9,000 visitors\n\nFor shows:\n\n15,000 * 30% = 15,000 * 0.3 = 4,500 visitors\n\nFor other activities:\n\n15,000 * 10% = 15,000 * 0.1 = 1,500 visitors\n\nNow, the park has different staff-to-guest ratios for each area:\n\n- Rides: 1:50\n\n- Shows: 1:75\n\n- Activity centers: 1:25\n\nI need to calculate the average number of staff members required for each ride, show, and activity center.\n\nLet's start with the rides. There are 20 rides in the park.\n\nTotal staff needed for rides = total ride visitors / (staff-to-guest ratio for rides)\n\nSo,\n\nStaff for rides = 9,000 / 50 = 180 staff members\n\nSince there are 20 rides, the average number of staff per ride is:\n\n180 staff / 20 rides = 9 staff per ride\n\nNow, for shows. There are 10 shows.\n\nTotal staff needed for shows = total show visitors / (staff-to-guest ratio for shows)\n\nStaff for shows = 4,500 / 75 = 60 staff members\n\nAverage staff per show = 60 staff / 10 shows = 6 staff per show\n\nNext, for activity centers. There are 5 activity centers.\n\nTotal staff needed for activity centers = total activity visitors / (staff-to-guest ratio for activity centers)\n\nStaff for activity centers = 1,500 / 25 = 60 staff members\n\nAverage staff per activity center = 60 staff / 5 centers = 12 staff per center\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Average staff per ride: 9\n\n- Average staff per show: 6\n\n- Average staff per activity center: 12\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the visitors:\n\n15,000 * 0.6 = 9,000 for rides\n\n15,000 * 0.3 = 4,500 for shows\n\n15,000 * 0.1 = 1,500 for activities\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, staff calculations:\n\nFor rides: 9,000 / 50 = 180 staff\n\nFor shows: 4,500 / 75 = 60 staff\n\nFor activities: 1,500 / 25 = 60 staff\n\nThen, averaging them per facility:\n\nRides: 180 / 20 = 9 per ride\n\nShows: 60 / 10 = 6 per show\n\nActivities: 60 / 5 = 12 per activity center\n\nYes, that looks right.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if all visitors are exclusively in one category. Do visitors only choose one activity per day, or could they do multiple things? The problem says \"on average, the park receives 15,000 visitors per day, with 60% visiting rides, 30% attending shows, and 10% participating in other activities.\" It seems like these are mutual exclusive choices, meaning a visitor chooses one main activity.\n\nIf that's the case, then my initial approach is correct.\n\nHowever, in reality, visitors might do multiple things during their visit. For example, they might go on a few rides and watch a show. But based on the problem's wording, it seems that each visitor is categorized into one main activity.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the staff-to-guest ratios are specific to each area. So, the park wants 1 staff member for every 50 guests in the rides area, 1:75 in shows, and 1:25 in activity centers.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps, and my calculations seem accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9 \\text{ staff per ride},\\ 6 \\text{ staff per show},\\ 12 \\text{ staff per activity center}} \\]"
