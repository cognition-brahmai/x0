        "content": "Let's solve the differential equation dy/dx = 2y. This is a separable differential equation, which means we can separate the variables y and x on opposite sides of the equation and integrate both sides.\n\nStarting with dy/dx = 2y, we can rewrite this as:\n\ndy/y = 2 dx\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n\u222b(1/y) dy = \u222b2 dx\n\nThe integral of 1/y with respect to y is ln|y|, and the integral of 2 with respect to x is 2x. So we have:\n\nln|y| = 2x + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration. To solve for y, we exponentiate both sides:\n\ne^(ln|y|) = e^(2x + C)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n|y| = e^(2x) * e^C\n\nSince e^C is just another constant, we can write it as C:\n\n|y| = C e^(2x)\n\nNow, because y can be positive or negative, we can write the general solution as:\n\ny = C e^(2x)\n\nWhere C is an arbitrary constant that can be positive or negative.\n\nTo verify, we can differentiate y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = 2 C e^(2x) = 2y\n\nWhich matches the original differential equation.\n\nSo the solution is y = C e^(2x)."
