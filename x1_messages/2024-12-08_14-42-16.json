        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with 120 employees in total. Out of these, 60% are men, and the remaining are women. We need to find out how many more men there are than women in the company.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many men work at the company. Since 60% of the employees are men, I can calculate the number of men by taking 60% of 120.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 120, I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of men = (60/100) * 120\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n60 divided by 100 is 0.6.\n\nThen, 0.6 multiplied by 120 is 72.\n\nSo, there are 72 men in the company.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many women work at the company. Since the rest of the employees are women, I can subtract the number of men from the total number of employees.\n\nNumber of women = Total employees - Number of men\n\nNumber of women = 120 - 72 = 48\n\nSo, there are 48 women in the company.\n\nNow, to find out how many more men than women there are, I need to subtract the number of women from the number of men.\n\nDifference = Number of men - Number of women\n\nDifference = 72 - 48 = 24\n\nTherefore, there are 24 more men than women working at the company.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 60% of 120:\n\n(60/100) * 120 = 0.6 * 120 = 72 men.\n\nThen, total employees minus men: 120 - 72 = 48 women.\n\nDifference: 72 - 48 = 24.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the percentage of women and then find the difference based on percentages.\n\nSince 60% are men, then 100% - 60% = 40% are women.\n\nSo, number of women = 40% of 120.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(40/100) * 120 = 0.4 * 120 = 48 women.\n\nDifference: 72 men - 48 women = 24.\n\nSame result. So, it's confirmed.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use proportions.\n\nIf 60% are men, then for every 100 employees, 60 are men and 40 are women.\n\nSo, the ratio of men to women is 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut since we have 120 employees in total, we can divide 120 into 5 parts (3 + 2).\n\nEach part represents 120 / 5 = 24 employees.\n\nTherefore, men: 3 parts * 24 = 72\n\nWomen: 2 parts * 24 = 48\n\nDifference: 72 - 48 = 24\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that there are 24 more men than women in the company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
