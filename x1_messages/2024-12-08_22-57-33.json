        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of candies: chocolate bars and lollipops. The chocolate bars cost $1.50 each, and the lollipops cost $0.25 each. The customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends $15. We need to find out how many of each type of candy they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's use variables to represent the unknowns. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of chocolate bars.\n\n- Let \\( l \\) represent the number of lollipops.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candies is 20.\n\n2. The total cost is $15.\n\nSo, we can write two equations based on these pieces of information.\n\nFirst equation: The total number of candies:\n\n\\[ c + l = 20 \\]\n\nSecond equation: The total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50c + 0.25l = 15 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think substitution might be straightforward here.\n\nLet\u2019s solve the first equation for one of the variables, say \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ l = 20 - c \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( l \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 1.50c + 0.25(20 - c) = 15 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify and solve for \\( c \\):\n\nFirst, distribute the 0.25:\n\n\\[ 1.50c + 0.25 \\times 20 - 0.25c = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.50c + 5 - 0.25c = 15 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ (1.50c - 0.25c) + 5 = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.25c + 5 = 15 \\]\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 1.25c = 10 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.25:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{10}{1.25} \\]\n\n\\[ c = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 8 chocolate bars.\n\nNow, we can find \\( l \\) by plugging \\( c = 8 \\) back into the equation \\( l = 20 - c \\):\n\n\\[ l = 20 - 8 \\]\n\n\\[ l = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 8 chocolate bars and 12 lollipops.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check this to make sure it makes sense. The cost of 8 chocolate bars at $1.50 each would be:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 1.50 = 12 \\]\n\nThe cost of 12 lollipops at $0.25 each would be:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 0.25 = 3 \\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[ 12 + 3 = 15 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the total amount spent. Also, the total number of candies is:\n\n\\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \\]\n\nWhich matches the total number of candies purchased. So, our solution seems correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the cost difference between the two types of candies. Since chocolate bars are more expensive than lollipops, buying more chocolate bars would increase the total cost, while buying more lollipops would decrease it.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the maximum and minimum possible amounts to see this in perspective.\n\nIf the customer bought all chocolate bars (20 of them):\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 1.50 = 30 \\]\n\nThat\u2019s more than $15.\n\nIf the customer bought all lollipops (20 of them):\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.25 = 5 \\]\n\nThat\u2019s less than $15.\n\nSo, the combination must be somewhere in between. We can think about how many chocolate bars are needed to make up the difference between $5 and $15.\n\nThe difference is:\n\n\\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \\]\n\nEach chocolate bar costs $1.50, but since each lollipop costs $0.25, replacing one lollipop with one chocolate bar increases the total cost by:\n\n\\[ 1.50 - 0.25 = 1.25 \\]\n\nSo, to make up the $10 difference, the number of chocolate bars needed is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{1.25} = 8 \\]\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, 8 chocolate bars and 12 lollipops is the correct combination.\n\nThis method is essentially using the concept of weighted averages or cost differences, which can be a quicker way to solve such problems once you understand the relationships between the variables.\n\nIn summary, by setting up and solving a system of equations or by considering the cost differences, we find that the customer purchased 8 chocolate bars and 12 lollipops.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8 \\text{ chocolate bars and } 12 \\text{ lollipops}} \\]"
