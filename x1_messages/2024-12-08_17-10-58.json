        "content": "To determine how many different committees of 3 people can be formed from 12 employees, we need to calculate the number of combinations of 12 employees taken 3 at a time. This is because the order in which the committee members are selected does not matter; it's the combination that counts.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of \\( n \\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( n = 12 \\) (total employees),\n\n- \\( k = 3 \\) (committee members).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3!(12 - 3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute the factorials:\n\n- \\( 12! = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9! \\),\n\n- \\( 9! \\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( 3! \\):\n\n\\[\n3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, perform the multiplication in the numerator:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 11 = 132\n\\]\n\n\\[\n132 \\times 10 = 1320\n\\]\n\nThen, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1320}{6} = 220\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of different committees that can be formed is 220.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{220} \\]"
