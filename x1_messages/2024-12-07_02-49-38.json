        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. So, the store is offering a 20% discount on an item that costs $150 originally. Then, on top of that, the customer has a coupon for an additional 10% off after the first discount is applied. We need to find out the final price the customer pays.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the 20% discount on $150. To find 20% of $150, I can multiply 150 by 0.20.\n\n150 * 0.20 = 30\n\nSo, the first discount is $30. Now, I subtract that from the original price to get the price after the first discount.\n\n150 - 30 = 120\n\nNow, the customer has a coupon for an additional 10% off on this already discounted price of $120. So, I need to find 10% of $120.\n\n120 * 0.10 = 12\n\nSo, the additional discount is $12. Subtract that from the already discounted price.\n\n120 - 12 = 108\n\nTherefore, the final price the customer pays is $108.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Sometimes, stores apply discounts differently, but in this case, it seems straightforward. First, a 20% discount is applied to the original price, reducing it to $120, and then an additional 10% off on $120 brings it down to $108.\n\nAlternatively, some people might think that you can combine the discounts, but in this case, since the second discount is applied after the first one, they are stacked, not combined into a single discount percentage.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the total percentage discount. A 20% discount followed by a 10% discount is not the same as a 30% discount overall. That's a common mistake.\n\nLet me see: if it were a single 30% discount on $150, it would be:\n\n150 * 0.30 = 45\n\n150 - 45 = 105\n\nBut that's not what's happening here. Here, the discounts are applied sequentially: first 20%, then an additional 10% on the reduced price.\n\nSo, the correct final price is indeed $108.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to look at it. Suppose I consider the combined effect of both discounts. The first discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Then, the additional 10% off means the customer pays 90% of the already discounted price.\n\nSo, first, 80% of $150 is:\n\n150 * 0.80 = 120\n\nThen, 90% of $120 is:\n\n120 * 0.90 = 108\n\nAgain, $108. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the overall discount rate. The overall discount is:\n\nOriginal price - Final price = 150 - 108 = 42\n\nSo, the total discount is $42.\n\nTo find the total discount percentage:\n\n(42 / 150) * 100% = 28%\n\nSo, the two discounts combined result in a 28% total discount, not 30%. That makes sense because the second discount is applied to the already discounted price, not the original price.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the combined discount factor. The first discount is 20%, so the discount factor is 0.80. The second discount is 10%, so its discount factor is 0.90. Multiplying these factors gives the overall discount factor:\n\n0.80 * 0.90 = 0.72\n\nThen, multiplying the original price by this overall discount factor:\n\n150 * 0.72 = 108\n\nAgain, $108.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I keep arriving at $108 as the final price. Therefore, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]"
