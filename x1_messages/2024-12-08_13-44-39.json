        "content": "Let's tackle this equation step by step. The equation we have is:\n\n5x - 3(2x + 1) = 7\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the left side of the equation. I see that there's a -3 multiplied by (2x + 1). I need to distribute that -3 to both terms inside the parentheses.\n\nSo, -3 times 2x is -6x, and -3 times 1 is -3. So, the equation becomes:\n\n5x - 6x - 3 = 7\n\nNow, I can combine the like terms on the left side. 5x and -6x are like terms.\n\n5x - 6x is -x, so the equation simplifies to:\n\n-x - 3 = 7\n\nNext, I want to isolate the variable x. To do that, I can add 3 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -3 on the left side.\n\nSo, adding 3 to both sides:\n\n-x - 3 + 3 = 7 + 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-x = 10\n\nNow, I have -x = 10. To solve for x, I need to multiply both sides by -1 to make x positive.\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1:\n\n(-1)(-x) = (-1)(10)\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx = -10\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If -x = 10, then multiplying both sides by -1 should give x = -10. But let me verify this by plugging the value back into the original equation to make sure it's correct.\n\nSo, original equation:\n\n5x - 3(2x + 1) = 7\n\nPlugging x = -10:\n\n5(-10) - 3(2*(-10) + 1) = ?\n\nCalculate inside the parentheses first:\n\n2*(-10) + 1 = -20 + 1 = -19\n\nNow, -3 times -19 is +57\n\nSo, 5*(-10) is -50\n\nSo, -50 + 57 = 7\n\nYes, that equals 7, which matches the right side of the equation. So, x = -10 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if there was another way to approach this equation to confirm the answer.\n\nLet's try distributing the 5x first, but that might not be necessary since the parentheses were already handled.\n\nAlternatively, I could have written the equation as:\n\n5x - 3(2x + 1) = 7\n\nFirst, distribute the -3:\n\n5x - 6x - 3 = 7\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-x - 3 = 7\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n-x = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx = -10\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached it differently by adding 3 to both sides first:\n\n5x - 3(2x + 1) = 7\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n5x - 3(2x + 1) + 3 = 7 + 3\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n5x - 6x - 3 + 3 = 5x - 6x = -x\n\nSo, -x = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx = -10\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nSo, no matter how I approach it, I end up with x = -10.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-10} \\]"
