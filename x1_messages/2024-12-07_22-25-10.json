        "content": "BEGININPUT\nSir Isaac Newton is indeed renowned for his development of calculus and his laws of motion and universal gravitation, which are cornerstones of classical mechanics. However, he made several other significant contributions to science that are often less highlighted. In astronomy, Newton's work went beyond just proving that the Earth revolves around the sun, which was already established by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. Newton's law of universal gravitation provided a mathematical explanation for the motions of planets and other celestial bodies, thereby unifying terrestrial and celestial mechanics.\n\nMoreover, Newton made substantial contributions to optics. He conducted experiments with prisms that led to the discovery that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors, which was a groundbreaking revelation in the field of optics. He also developed the reflecting telescope, known as the Newtonian telescope, which overcame certain limitations of refracting telescopes by using a mirror to focus light.\n\nIn addition to these, Newton's work in alchemy and theology is also noteworthy, although these areas are often separated from his scientific contributions due to their nature. His alchemical work involved extensive research and experimentation, and he left behind a significant body of manuscript pages on the subject. Newton's theological studies were extensive, and he wrote extensively on biblical topics, though much of this work was not published during his lifetime.\n\nAs for the source, the information seems to be derived from a Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on the history of quantum mechanics, specifically a section discussing Newton's principles. However, it's important to note that Newton's work spans across multiple fields, and his contributions to science are vast and profound.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- *Newton, I. (1687).
