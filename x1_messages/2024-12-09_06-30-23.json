        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A farmer has a rectangular field that's 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to plant trees along the perimeter of the field, making sure that each tree is an equal distance apart, and no more than 20 meters between them. I need to figure out the minimum number of trees he needs to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the perimeter of the field because that's where the trees are going to be planted. For a rectangle, the perimeter P is calculated as P = 2*(length + width). So, plugging in the values, P = 2*(120 + 80) = 2*(200) = 400 meters. So, the total perimeter is 400 meters.\n\nNow, the trees need to be planted at equal distances apart, and that distance should be no more than 20 meters. So, the maximum distance between two consecutive trees is 20 meters. To find out the minimum number of trees needed, I should use the maximum possible distance between them, which is 20 meters, because the smaller the distance, the more trees are needed.\n\nSo, if the distance between each tree is 20 meters, and the total perimeter is 400 meters, then the number of trees needed would be 400 divided by 20, which is 20 trees.\n\nWait a minute, but when planting trees along a closed path, like the perimeter of a field, the first and the last tree coincide, so we have to be careful not to double-count the starting tree. In an open path, you'd have trees at both ends, but in a closed path, the starting and ending trees are the same.\n\nLet me think about this again. If the perimeter is 400 meters and trees are planted every 20 meters, starting from a point, then the positions would be at 0 meters, 20 meters, 40 meters, and so on, up to 380 meters, and then the next tree at 400 meters, which is the same as the starting point.\n\nSo, the number of trees would be the perimeter divided by the distance between them, which is 400 / 20 = 20 trees.\n\nBut wait, in a closed loop, the number of trees is equal to the perimeter divided by the distance between them, and since the starting and ending trees coincide, we don't add an extra tree.\n\nSo, 20 trees should be sufficient.\n\nBut the problem says \"no more than 20 meters apart.\" Does that mean that the distance could be less than 20 meters, but not more? In that case, using 20 meters would be the maximum allowed distance, so using that should give us the minimum number of trees needed.\n\nIf the distance between trees is less than 20 meters, say 10 meters, then more trees would be needed, which would exceed the minimum number.\n\nSo, to minimize the number of trees, we should use the maximum allowed distance, which is 20 meters.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of trees needed is 20.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's a smaller distance that might require fewer trees. Wait, no, smaller distances would require more trees, not fewer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to arrange the trees with a greater distance but still satisfy the \"no more than 20 meters apart\" condition.\n\nBut the condition is that no two trees are more than 20 meters apart, so the maximum distance between any two trees cannot exceed 20 meters.\n\nTherefore, to minimize the number of trees, we should use the maximum allowed distance, which is 20 meters.\n\nHence, the minimum number of trees is 20.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
