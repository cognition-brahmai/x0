        "content": "Sure! To help you with these tasks, I'll assume that the 'Students' and 'Courses' tables are related through a junction table, say 'Enrollments', which connects students to the courses they are enrolled in. However, since the 'Enrollments' table isn't explicitly mentioned in your question, I'll proceed with the given tables and make some assumptions where necessary.\n\n### 1. List all students majoring in Computer Science.\n\nTo list all students who are majoring in Computer Science, you can use a simple SELECT query on the 'Students' table with a WHERE clause to filter by major.\n\n```sql\nSELECT student_id, name\nFROM Students\nWHERE major = 'Computer Science';\n```\n\n### 2. Find the instructor of a particular course.\n\nTo find the instructor of a specific course, you need to query the 'Courses' table and select the instructor column based on the course_name.\n\n```sql\nSELECT instructor\nFROM Courses\nWHERE course_name = ' PARTICULAR COURSE NAME ';\n```\n\nReplace `' PARTICULAR COURSE NAME '` with the actual name of the course you're interested in.\n\n### 3. Count the number of courses offered by each instructor.\n\nTo count the number of courses offered by each instructor, you can use the GROUP BY clause on the 'instructor' column in the 'Courses' table and apply the COUNT function to count the courses per instructor.\n\n```sql\nSELECT instructor, COUNT(course_id) AS number_of_courses\nFROM Courses\nGROUP BY instructor;\n```\n\nThis query will list each instructor along with the count of courses they are associated with.\n\nThese queries should help you interact with your database to achieve the tasks you've described. If there are more specific requirements or if the table structures are different, please provide additional details, and I'll adjust the queries accordingly."
