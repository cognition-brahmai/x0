If there are 7 people in the group, how many hours will the movie marathon last if each movie is approximately 1.5 hours long? Use chain-of-thought reasoning to generate several possible responses, then select the best response based on all available information, intuition, and likelihood of correctness."

        "content": "Let's see. There are 7 friends, and each brings 2 movies. So, total movies are 7 times 2, which is 14 movies. Each movie is about 1.5 hours long. So, total time would be 14 times 1.5 hours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Yes, 7 people, each bringing 2 movies: 7 * 2 = 14 movies.\n\nEach movie is 1.5 hours long, so total time is 14 * 1.5.\n\nNow, 14 * 1.5... Let's see, 14 * 1 is 14, and 14 * 0.5 is 7, so 14 + 7 = 21 hours.\n\nSo, the marathon will last 21 hours.\n\nBut, maybe there's more to it. Do they take breaks between movies? Or is it straight from one movie to another?\n\nThe question says \"movie marathon,\" so maybe they watch movies back-to-back without breaks. But sometimes, in marathons, people do take short breaks, like for snacks or bathroom breaks.\n\nHmm, but the question doesn't specify any breaks, so maybe it's best to assume no breaks and just calculate based on movie lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the movies aren't exactly 1.5 hours each. Maybe some are a bit longer, some shorter. But since it says \"approximately 1.5 hours,\" averaging out, it should be okay to use 1.5 hours per movie.\n\nAlso, perhaps they show credits or have previews before each movie, but the question doesn't mention any of that, so it's probably safe to ignore.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems reasonable: 14 movies * 1.5 hours/movie = 21 hours.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider the possibility of different movie lengths. For example, if some movies are 1 hour and some are 2 hours, averaging to 1.5 hours. But since the question says \"each movie is approximately 1.5 hours long,\" it's acceptable to use 1.5 as the average length.\n\nAnother thought: maybe some movies overlap or are watched simultaneously, but the question says \"everyone's movies should be watched once,\" so probably each movie is watched one after another.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are different screens or rooms, but again, the question doesn't suggest that; it seems like they are watching movies in sequence, one at a time.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation: 14 movies * 1.5 hours/movie = 21 hours.\n\nI think that's the best and most straightforward answer based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
