        "content": "So the factory makes 1200 units every day, and each unit has a 5% chance of being defective. I need to find out the expected number of defective units per day. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that \"expected value\" in probability is like the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. So, in this case, it's the average number of defective units I'd expect if the factory produces 1200 units daily over many days.\n\nEach unit has a 5% chance of being defective. That means for each unit, the probability of being defective is 0.05. Since the units are independent of each other, I can probably just multiply the total number of units by the probability of a single unit being defective to get the expected number of defective units.\n\nSo, expected defective units = total units per day \u00d7 probability of a unit being defective.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 1200 \u00d7 0.05.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1200 \u00d7 0.05 = 60.\n\nSo, the expected number of defective units per day is 60.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way to think about this? Maybe using the binomial distribution? Because each unit can be defective or not, which is a binary outcome, and the probability is constant.\n\nYes, this sounds like a binomial distribution problem, where the number of trials (n) is 1200, and the probability of success (defective unit, in this case) is p = 0.05.\n\nThe expected value for a binomial distribution is given by E(X) = n \u00d7 p.\n\nAgain, that's 1200 \u00d7 0.05 = 60.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe the fact that the factory produces the units every day. But since we're looking for the expected number per day, and the production is consistent daily, I think the daily expectation should be the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the variance to understand how much the actual number of defective units might deviate from the expected value. The variance for a binomial distribution is n \u00d7 p \u00d7 (1 - p).\n\nSo, variance = 1200 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 0.95 = 1200 \u00d7 0.0475 = 57.\n\nSo, the standard deviation would be the square root of 57, which is roughly 7.55.\n\nThis tells me that while the expected number is 60, the actual number could vary by about 7.55 units on average.\n\nBut the question only asks for the expected number, so 60 is the answer.\n\nI think that makes sense. It's a straightforward application of expected value in probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
