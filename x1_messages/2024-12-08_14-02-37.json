        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how much revenue is generated from each product per day, and then we can calculate the total revenue for both products over 20 days.\n\nSo, the factory produces 250 units of product A each day, and each unit sells for $15. To find the daily revenue from product A, we multiply the number of units by the price per unit:\n\n250 units/day * $15/unit = $3,750/day\n\nSimilarly, for product B, the factory produces 400 units each day, and each unit sells for $10. So, the daily revenue from product B is:\n\n400 units/day * $10/unit = $4,000/day\n\nNow, to find the total daily revenue from both products, we add the revenues together:\n\n$3,750/day + $4,000/day = $7,750/day\n\nNext, we need to find out the combined revenue over 20 days. We do this by multiplying the daily total revenue by the number of days:\n\n$7,750/day * 20 days = $155,000\n\nSo, the combined revenue from both products after 20 days is $155,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the daily revenue from product A is indeed 250 units times $15 per unit, which is $3,750. For product B, 400 units times $10 per unit equals $4,000. Adding those together gives $7,750 per day. Multiplying by 20 days gives $155,000. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total units produced over 20 days for each product and then multiply by their respective prices. For product A: 250 units/day * 20 days = 5,000 units. At $15 each, that's 5,000 * $15 = $75,000.\n\nFor product B: 400 units/day * 20 days = 8,000 units. At $10 each, that's 8,000 * $10 = $80,000.\n\nAdding those together: $75,000 + $80,000 = $155,000. Same answer.\n\nI think that's accurate. So, the combined revenue from both products after 20 days is $155,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{155000} \\]"
