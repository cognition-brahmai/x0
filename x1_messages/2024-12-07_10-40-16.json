Too fine, too coarse; must be just right, like the Jedi's control of the Force.\" \n\n\"Next, the water, pure and hot, but not too hot, like the padawan's temper.\" \n\n\"Combining them, carefully, like a lightsaber duel, requires patience and skill.\" \n\n\"Finally, the taste, rich and bold, like the wisdom of the Jedi Council.\" \n\n\"Remember, my young padawan, in the simplest tasks, lies the path to greatness.\""
