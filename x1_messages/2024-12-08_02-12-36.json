        "content": "Let's see. If today is Monday, and we want to know what day it will be 1000 days from now, we can approach this by understanding how days of the week cycle.\n\nFirst, I know that a week has 7 days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So, every 7 days, the cycle repeats.\n\nTo find out what day it will be 1000 days from today, we can divide 1000 by 7 and see what the remainder is. The remainder will tell us how many days beyond complete weeks we have to count.\n\nSo, let's do the division: 1000 divided by 7.\n\n7 times 142 is 994, because 7 times 140 is 980, and 7 times 2 is 14, so 980 plus 14 is 994.\n\n1000 minus 994 is 6, so the remainder is 6.\n\nThat means 1000 days is exactly 142 weeks and 6 days.\n\nSo, starting from Monday, if we count ahead 6 days:\n\nMonday + 1 day = Tuesday\n\nTuesday + 1 day = Wednesday\n\nWednesday + 1 day = Thursday\n\nThursday + 1 day = Friday\n\nFriday + 1 day = Saturday\n\nSaturday + 1 day = Sunday\n\nTherefore, 1000 days from today, which is Monday, will be Sunday.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf today is Monday, and we're adding 1000 days, which is 142 weeks and 6 days, then yes, counting 6 days ahead from Monday brings us to Sunday.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of modulo arithmetic. The days of the week repeat every 7 days, so we can use modulo 7 to find the day.\n\nAssign numbers to the days:\n\nMonday = 0\n\nTuesday = 1\n\nWednesday = 2\n\nThursday = 3\n\nFriday = 4\n\nSaturday = 5\n\nSunday = 6\n\nThen, today is Monday, which is 0.\n\nAdding 1000 days: 0 + 1000 = 1000\n\nNow, 1000 modulo 7:\n\n7 times 142 is 994, as before, remainder 6.\n\nSo, 1000 mod 7 is 6, which corresponds to Sunday.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each week has 7 days, and 7 days later it's the same day, so 1000 days is 142 weeks and 6 days, meaning it's 6 days after Monday, which is Sunday.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nLet's pick a known date and calculate forward 1000 days to see what day it lands on.\n\nFor example, let's say today is Monday, January 1, 2024.\n\nFirst, I need to know if 2024 is a leap year. Yes, 2024 is divisible by 4, and not divisible by 100 unless also by 400, but 2024 is not divisible by 100, so it's a leap year with 366 days.\n\nBut maybe it's too complicated to work with actual dates. Perhaps sticking to the modulo approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that in 1000 days, there will be 1000 \u00f7 7 = 142 weeks and 6 days, as previously calculated.\n\nSo, regardless of the starting point, adding 1000 days is the same as adding 6 days to the starting day of the week.\n\nTherefore, starting from Monday, adding 6 days brings us to Sunday.\n\nAnother way to think about it: each day of the week is advanced by the remainder of days after complete weeks.\n\nSo, in this case, the remainder is 6, so the day is advanced by 6 days.\n\nThus, Monday + 6 days = Sunday.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nJust to make extra sure, let's consider what happens with smaller numbers.\n\nSuppose today is Monday, and we add 1 day: it's Tuesday.\n\nAdd 2 days: Wednesday.\n\nUp to 7 days: back to Monday.\n\n8 days: Tuesday, and so on.\n\nSo, adding 6 days to Monday should be Sunday.\n\nYes, that holds up.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Sunday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Sunday}} \\]"
