        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are four houses in a row: blue, red, green, and yellow. The yellow house is at one end and not next to the blue house. The blue house is next to the red house, and the red house isn't next to the green house. Hmm.\n\nFirst, since the yellow house is at one end and not next to the blue house, that means the blue house can't be next to yellow. So, if yellow is at one end, and blue isn't next to it, then blue has to be at the other end or in the middle, but not right next to yellow.\n\nLet me try to map this out. Let's assume the positions are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nOption 1: Yellow is at position 1.\n\nSince yellow is at position 1, and it's not next to blue, blue can't be at position 2. So blue has to be at position 3 or 4.\n\nBut blue is next to red, so if blue is at position 3, red has to be at position 2 or 4. Wait, but position 2 is already yellow, so red can't be at position 2. So red has to be at position 4.\n\nBut then, red is next to blue at position 3 and 4.\n\nNow, red is not next to green, so green can't be at position 3 or 5 (but there is no position 5), so green can't be next to red.\n\nSo, if red is at position 4, green can't be at position 3 (which is blue) or position 5 (which doesn't exist). So green has to be at position 2.\n\nWait, but position 2 is already yellow. Oh, that can't be. So this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nOption 2: Yellow is at position 4.\n\nSo yellow is at position 4, which is one end.\n\nSince yellow is not next to blue, blue can't be at position 3.\n\nSo blue has to be at position 1, 2, or possibly 3, but since it can't be next to yellow, it can't be at position 3.\n\nWait, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nYellow is at position 4.\n\nSo blue can't be at position 3, because that would be next to yellow.\n\nSo blue has to be at position 1 or 2.\n\nLet's say blue is at position 1.\n\nThen, blue is next to red, so red has to be at position 2.\n\nThen, green can't be next to red, so green can't be at position 1 or 3.\n\nBut position 1 is blue, position 3 can be green or yellow, but yellow is at position 4.\n\nSo green can be at position 3.\n\nAnd position 4 is yellow.\n\nSo the order would be:\n\nPosition 1: Blue\n\nPosition 2: Red\n\nPosition 3: Green\n\nPosition 4: Yellow\n\nNow, let's check if this satisfies all conditions.\n\n- Blue is next to red: yes, positions 1 and 2.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red is at 2, green is at 3, which are next to each other. Oh, that violates the condition.\n\nWait, red can't be next to green. So this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nOption 3: Yellow is at position 4, blue is at position 2.\n\nThen, blue is next to red, so red has to be at position 1 or 3.\n\nIf red is at position 1, then green can't be next to red, so green can't be at position 2 or 4.\n\nBut position 2 is blue, position 4 is yellow, so green has to be at position 3.\n\nSo the arrangement would be:\n\nPosition 1: Red\n\nPosition 2: Blue\n\nPosition 3: Green\n\nPosition 4: Yellow\n\nNow, check the conditions:\n\n- Blue is next to red: yes, positions 1 and 2.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red is at 1, green is at 3, so they are not next to each other. Good.\n\n- Yellow is at one end: position 4 is one end, yes.\n\n- Yellow is not next to blue: yellow is at 4, blue is at 2, not next to each other. Good.\n\nSo this seems to satisfy all the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, is there another possible arrangement?\n\nLet's check.\n\nOption 4: Yellow is at position 1.\n\nThen, blue can't be at position 2.\n\nSo blue has to be at position 3 or 4.\n\nIf blue is at position 3, then red has to be at position 2 or 4.\n\nBut position 4 is not next to yellow, so red can be at position 2 or 4.\n\nIf red is at position 2, then green can't be at position 1 (yellow) or 3 (blue).\n\nSo green has to be at position 4.\n\nBut position 4 is already yellow. So that doesn't work.\n\nIf red is at position 4, then green can't be at position 3 (blue) or 5 (doesn't exist).\n\nSo green has to be at position 2.\n\nSo the arrangement would be:\n\nPosition 1: Yellow\n\nPosition 2: Green\n\nPosition 3: Blue\n\nPosition 4: Red\n\nNow, check the conditions:\n\n- Blue is next to red: blue is at 3, red at 4, yes.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red is at 4, green is at 2, not next to each other. Good.\n\n- Yellow is at one end: position 1, yes.\n\n- Yellow is not next to blue: yellow is at 1, blue is at 3, not next to each other. Good.\n\nSo this arrangement also satisfies all the conditions.\n\nWait, so there are two possible arrangements?\n\nArrangement 1:\n\nPosition 1: Red\n\nPosition 2: Blue\n\nPosition 3: Green\n\nPosition 4: Yellow\n\nArrangement 2:\n\nPosition 1: Yellow\n\nPosition 2: Green\n\nPosition 3: Blue\n\nPosition 4: Red\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest there is only one order, but according to this, there are two possible orders.\n\nMaybe I missed something.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nIn the first arrangement:\n\nRed, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n- Blue is next to red: yes.\n\n- Red is not next to green: yes, green is at position 3, red at 2, separated by blue.\n\n- Yellow is at one end: position 4.\n\n- Yellow is not next to blue: yellow is at 4, blue is at 2, not next to each other.\n\nIn the second arrangement:\n\nYellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n- Blue is next to red: yes, positions 3 and 4.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red is at 4, green is at 2, not next to each other.\n\n- Yellow is at one end: position 1.\n\n- Yellow is not next to blue: yellow is at 1, blue is at 3, not next to each other.\n\nSo both arrangements satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nMaybe the problem expects only one specific order, but according to the conditions, both are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is only one correct order based on additional implied constraints.\n\nWait, maybe the problem implies that the houses are ordered from left to right, and the ends are positions 1 and 4.\n\nBut in both arrangements, yellow is at one end, either position 1 or position 4.\n\nSo both arrangements are valid based on the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the order from left to right, starting from position 1 to position 4.\n\nBut since position 1 could be either yellow or red in the first arrangement, it might be ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a standard way to list the order from left to right, assuming position 1 is the leftmost.\n\nIn that case, both arrangements are possible.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects only one order, so maybe I need to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the yellow house is at one end, but not specify which end, and just list the order relative to each other.\n\nBut in that case, both arrangements are valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet me list all possible permutations of the four houses and eliminate those that don't satisfy the conditions.\n\nThere are 4! = 24 possible arrangements.\n\nLet's list them and eliminate based on the conditions.\n\n1. Yellow at position 1:\n\n- Yellow, Blue, Red, Green: Yellow is at end, but blue is next to yellow. Violates yellow not next to blue.\n\n- Yellow, Blue, Green, Red: Same issue.\n\n- Yellow, Red, Blue, Green: Yellow at end, blue next to red, red not next to green. This works.\n\n- Yellow, Red, Green, Blue: Red is next to green. Violates red not next to green.\n\n- Yellow, Green, Blue, Red: Yellow at end, blue next to red, red not next to green. This works.\n\n- Yellow, Green, Red, Blue: Red is next to green. Violates condition.\n\n2. Yellow at position 2:\n\n- This can't happen because yellow is at one end, so position 1 or 4.\n\n3. Yellow at position 3:\n\n- This can't happen because yellow is at one end, so position 1 or 4.\n\n4. Yellow at position 4:\n\n- Blue can't be at position 3.\n\n- So blue has to be at position 1 or 2.\n\n- If blue at position 1:\n\n- Blue next to red at position 2.\n\n- Red not next to green, so green can't be at position 1 or 3.\n\n- Green has to be at position 3.\n\n- So: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n- Check: Blue next to red, red not next to green, yellow at end, yellow not next to blue. This works.\n\n- If blue at position 2:\n\n- Blue next to red at position 1 or 3.\n\n- If red at position 1:\n\n- Green can't be at position 2 or 4.\n\n- Green at position 3.\n\n- But position 3 is already blue. Can't have two blue houses.\n\n- So invalid.\n\n- If red at position 3:\n\n- Green can't be at position 2 or 4.\n\n- Green at position 1.\n\n- So: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\n- Check: Blue next to red, red not next to green, yellow at end, yellow not next to blue. This works.\n\nSo, from this, we have two valid arrangements:\n\n1. Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n2. Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\nWait, no, in the first part, when yellow is at position 1, we have:\n\n- Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\nAnd when yellow is at position 4:\n\n- Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n- Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nWait, in the second case, when yellow is at position 4, and blue is at position 2:\n\n- Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought blue can't be at position 2 when yellow is at position 4, but actually, it can.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nWhen yellow is at position 4:\n\n- Blue can't be at position 3, because yellow is at position 4, and blue can't be next to yellow.\n\n- So blue can be at position 1 or 2.\n\n- If blue at position 1:\n\n- Red at position 2.\n\n- Green at position 3.\n\n- Yellow at position 4.\n\n- This is: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n- If blue at position 2:\n\n- Red at position 1 or 3.\n\n- If red at position 1:\n\n- Green at position 3.\n\n- But position 3 is already blue. Wait, no, blue is at position 2, red at position 1, green at position 3, yellow at position 4.\n\n- This is: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n- Now, check if red is next to green: red is at 1, green is at 3, not next to each other. Good.\n\n- Blue is next to red: blue is at 2, next to red at 1.\n\n- Yellow is at end: position 4.\n\n- Yellow not next to blue: yellow at 4, blue at 2, not next to each other.\n\n- So this also works.\n\nWait, so there are three possible arrangements:\n\n1. Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n2. Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n3. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\nWait, earlier I thought only two, but now there are three.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I only found two, but now there are three.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nWhen yellow is at position 1:\n\n- Blue can't be at position 2.\n\n- So blue is at position 2 or 3 or 4, but can't be next to yellow, so not position 2.\n\n- So blue at position 3 or 4.\n\n- If blue at position 3:\n\n- Red at position 2 or 4.\n\n- If red at position 2:\n\n- Green at position 4.\n\n- But position 4 is already yellow. Can't have two yellow houses.\n\n- So invalid.\n\n- If red at position 4:\n\n- Green at position 2.\n\n- So: Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n- This works.\n\n- If blue at position 4:\n\n- Red at position 3.\n\n- Green at position 2.\n\n- So: Yellow, Green, Red, Blue.\n\n- Now, check conditions:\n\n- Blue next to red: blue at 4, red at 3, yes.\n\n- Red not next to green: red at 3, green at 2, not next to each other.\n\n- Yellow at end: position 1.\n\n- Yellow not next to blue: yellow at 1, blue at 4, not next to each other.\n\n- This also works.\n\nSo, actually, when yellow is at position 1, there are two possible arrangements:\n\n- Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n- Yellow, Green, Red, Blue.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I only considered yellow, green, blue, red, and didn't consider yellow, green, red, blue.\n\nWait, in this case, yellow is at position 1, blue is at position 4, red is at position 3, green is at position 2.\n\n- Blue is next to red: blue at 4, red at 3, yes.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red at 3, green at 2, not next to each other.\n\n- Yellow at end: position 1.\n\n- Yellow not next to blue: yellow at 1, blue at 4, not next to each other.\n\n- This works.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n1. Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n2. Yellow, Green, Red, Blue.\n\n3. Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n4. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\nAre there any more?\n\nWait, in the case where yellow is at position 4:\n\n- Blue can't be at position 3.\n\n- So blue is at position 1 or 2.\n\n- If blue at position 1:\n\n- Red at position 2.\n\n- Green at position 3.\n\n- Yellow at position 4.\n\n- This is: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n- If blue at position 2:\n\n- Red at position 1 or 3.\n\n- If red at position 1:\n\n- Green at position 3.\n\n- So: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n- If red at position 3:\n\n- Green at position 1.\n\n- So: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\n- Now, check if red is next to green: red at 3, green at 1, not next to each other.\n\n- Blue is next to red: blue at 2, red at 3, yes.\n\n- Yellow at end: position 4.\n\n- Yellow not next to blue: yellow at 4, blue at 2, not next to each other.\n\n- This works.\n\nSo, another arrangement: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nSo, total arrangements are:\n\n1. Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n2. Yellow, Green, Red, Blue.\n\n3. Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n4. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n5. Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nWait, but in the second arrangement, Yellow, Green, Red, Blue:\n\n- Blue is at position 4, next to yellow, but yellow is at position 1, so blue is at position 4, which is not next to yellow. Position 4 is next to position 3, not position 1.\n\nWait, in a row of four positions, positions are adjacent only if they are consecutive.\n\nSo position 1 is next to position 2 and position 4 is next to position 3.\n\nSo in arrangement Yellow, Green, Red, Blue:\n\n- Blue is at position 4, next to red at position 3.\n\n- Red is at position 3, next to green at position 2.\n\n- Green is at position 2, next to yellow at position 1.\n\n- Blue is next to red, which is allowed.\n\n- Red is not next to green: but in this arrangement, red is next to green, which violates the condition.\n\nWait, red can't be next to green.\n\nIn this arrangement, red is at position 3, green at position 2, so they are next to each other. That violates the condition.\n\nSo, this arrangement is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only the first arrangement when yellow is at position 1 is valid: Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\nAnd the other arrangements are:\n\n- Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n- Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n- Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nWait, in Green, Blue, Red, Yellow:\n\n- Blue is next to red: blue at position 2, red at position 3, yes.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red at 3, green at 1, not next to each other.\n\n- Yellow at end: position 4.\n\n- Yellow not next to blue: yellow at 4, blue at 2, not next to each other.\n\n- This works.\n\nIn Red, Blue, Green, Yellow:\n\n- Blue is next to red: blue at 2, red at 1, yes.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red at 1, green at 3, not next to each other.\n\n- Yellow at end: position 4.\n\n- Yellow not next to blue: yellow at 4, blue at 2, not next to each other.\n\n- This works.\n\nIn Blue, Red, Green, Yellow:\n\n- Blue is next to red: blue at 1, red at 2, yes.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red at 2, green at 3, not next to each other in this arrangement.\n\n- Yellow at end: position 4.\n\n- Yellow not next to blue: yellow at 4, blue at 1, not next to each other.\n\n- This works.\n\nAnd in Yellow, Green, Blue, Red:\n\n- Blue is next to red: blue at 3, red at 4, yes.\n\n- Red is not next to green: red at 4, green at 2, not next to each other.\n\n- Yellow at end: position 1.\n\n- Yellow not next to blue: yellow at 1, blue at 3, not next to each other.\n\n- This works.\n\nSo, there are four possible arrangements:\n\n1. Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n2. Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n3. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n4. Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nWait, but in the earlier step, I thought Yellow, Green, Red, Blue was invalid because red is next to green, which violates the condition.\n\nSo, only the four arrangements above are valid.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple possible orders for the houses based on the given conditions.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a single definite order, and I need to find that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to list all possible orders.\n\nGiven that, I would say the possible orders are:\n\nOption A: Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\nOption B: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\nOption C: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\nOption D: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nBut if I have to choose one, perhaps Option A is the correct one expected by the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is only one correct order, and I have made a mistake in considering multiple orders.\n\nLet me try to find if there is only one possible order.\n\nSuppose yellow is at position 1.\n\nThen, blue can't be at position 2.\n\nSo blue has to be at position 3 or 4.\n\nIf blue is at position 3:\n\n- Red has to be at position 2 or 4.\n\n- If red at position 2:\n\n- Green has to be at position 4.\n\n- But then red is at 2, green at 4, yellow at 1, blue at 3.\n\n- This satisfies all conditions.\n\n- If red at position 4:\n\n- Green has to be at position 2.\n\n- So: Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n- This also satisfies all conditions.\n\nSo, two possibilities when yellow is at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, when yellow is at position 4:\n\n- Blue can't be at position 3.\n\n- So blue at position 1 or 2.\n\n- If blue at position 1:\n\n- Red at position 2.\n\n- Green at position 3.\n\n- Yellow at position 4.\n\n- This works.\n\n- If blue at position 2:\n\n- Red at position 1 or 3.\n\n- If red at position 1:\n\n- Green at position 3.\n\n- So: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n- This works.\n\n- If red at position 3:\n\n- Green at position 1.\n\n- So: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\n- This also works.\n\nSo, in total, there are four possible arrangements.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, there isn't a single definite order for the houses.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects one specific order, and I need to choose that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to describe all possible orders.\n\nGiven that, I would say the possible orders are:\n\n1. Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n2. Yellow, Green, Red, Blue.\n\n- But this violates red not next to green.\n\n- Wait, in this arrangement, red is next to green, which violates the condition.\n\n- So, only the first arrangement when yellow is at position 1: Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n3. Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n4. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n5. Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Yellow, Green, Red, Blue violates the condition, so perhaps it's not valid.\n\nTherefore, the valid arrangements are:\n\n- Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n- Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\n- Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.\n\n- Green, Blue, Red, Yellow.\n\nSo, four possible orders.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a single order, and I need to choose one based on additional logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to provide one possible order.\n\nIn that case, one possible order is Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\nAlternatively, another possible order is Blue, Red, Green, Yellow.\n\nGiven that, I would say one possible order is Yellow, Green, Blue, Red.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yellow, Green, Blue, Red}} \\]"
