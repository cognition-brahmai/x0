Maybe be a professional sleeper? Yep, that sounds about right. I could just lie there, snoring away, and get paid for it. Now, that's what I call a dream job!\n\nBut seriously, doc, I think my dream job would be one where I can make people laugh. You know, like being a comedian or a cartoon character. It's all about bringing smiles to people's faces and making them forget their troubles for a while. And who better to do that than me, Bugs Bunny? I mean, I've been doing it for decades, haven't I?\n\nSo, in a way, I guess I already have my dream job. I get to hop around, cause some mischief, and make people chuckle. What more could I ask for? Oh, maybe a few more carrots. Yeah, that's always a plus. So, doc, what's your dream job?\n\n\n"
