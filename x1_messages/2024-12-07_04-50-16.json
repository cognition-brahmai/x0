Well, buckle up because I\u2019ve got some news that might just turn that cocktail into a mocktail\u2014figuratively speaking, of course.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the deal: I\u2019ve been knee-deep in the Arc Reactor upgrades, trying to make it even more efficient. You know how I get when I\u2019ve got a challenge like that. Time just slips away, and before I know it, the sun is setting, and I realize I should probably make an appearance at home.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like I\u2019ll be running a bit late for our date night. I know, I know, you were probably all set to dive into that new Italian place downtown, and I appreciate how much effort you put into planning this evening. Trust me; I\u2019m not looking forward to missing out on that amazing pasta you were raving about.\n\nBut fear not, my love! I\u2019ve got a plan to make this right. First off, I\u2019ll have JARVIS order in some of your favorite dishes from that restaurant so we can still enjoy a taste of it at home. Secondly, maybe we can reschedule our dinner date for tomorrow night, just the two of us, and make it extra special.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ll wrap things up here as quickly as possible. I promise to be there as soon as I can. Maybe I\u2019ll even surprise you with a little something to make up for being late. After all, you deserve nothing but the best.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to see that beautiful smile of yours, even if it\u2019s a bit later than expected.\n\nLove you more than iron,\n\nTony"
