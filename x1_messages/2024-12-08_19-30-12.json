        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a game where players can score either 3 points or 5 points per turn. The player has accumulated a total of 47 points, and we need to find the minimum number of turns required to reach this score.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're looking for the least number of turns that can sum up to 47 points, with each turn contributing either 3 or 5 points. This sounds like a classic optimization problem, specifically a variation of the coin problem, where 3 and 5 are the denominations, and 47 is the total amount.\n\nIn such problems, the goal is to minimize the number of \"coins\" (in this case, turns) that make up the total amount. So, I should aim to use as many 5-point turns as possible, since they contribute more points per turn, thereby reducing the total number of turns needed.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(x\\) = number of 3-point turns\n\n- \\(y\\) = number of 5-point turns\n\nWe need to satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[3x + 5y = 47\\]\n\nAnd we want to minimize the total number of turns, which is:\n\n\\[x + y\\]\n\nSo, it's an optimization problem where we need to minimize \\(x + y\\) subject to \\(3x + 5y = 47\\), with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) being non-negative integers.\n\nA general strategy for such problems is to maximize the higher denomination (5-point turns) and minimize the lower denomination (3-point turns). So, let's see how many 5-point turns we can have.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[5y = 47 - 3x\\]\\[y = \\frac{47 - 3x}{5}\\]\n\nSince \\(y\\) must be an integer, \\(47 - 3x\\) must be divisible by 5. Similarly, \\(x\\) must be chosen such that \\(47 - 3x\\) is non-negative, because points can't be negative.\n\nSo, \\(47 - 3x \\geq 0\\), which implies \\(x \\leq \\frac{47}{3} \\approx 15.666\\). Since \\(x\\) must be an integer, \\(x \\leq 15\\).\n\nAlso, \\(47 - 3x\\) must be divisible by 5. Let's find the values of \\(x\\) that satisfy this condition.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate through possible values of \\(y\\) and see if \\(x\\) comes out to be an integer.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\(y\\) from 0 up to \\(\\frac{47}{5} = 9.4\\), so \\(y\\) can be from 0 to 9.\n\nFor each \\(y\\), calculate \\(x = \\frac{47 - 5y}{3}\\), and check if \\(x\\) is an integer.\n\nLet's start with \\(y = 9\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 45}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\] Not an integer.\n\n\\(y = 8\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 40}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}\\] Not an integer.\n\n\\(y = 7\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 35}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\\] Integer.\n\nSo, one possible solution is \\(x = 4\\), \\(y = 7\\), totaling \\(4 + 7 = 11\\) turns.\n\nLet\u2019s check if there's a solution with fewer turns.\n\n\\(y = 6\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 30}{3} = \\frac{17}{3}\\] Not an integer.\n\n\\(y = 5\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 25}{3} = \\frac{22}{3}\\] Not an integer.\n\n\\(y = 4\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 20}{3} = \\frac{27}{3} = 9\\] Integer.\n\nSo, another solution is \\(x = 9\\), \\(y = 4\\), totaling \\(9 + 4 = 13\\) turns.\n\nThis is more turns than the previous solution.\n\n\\(y = 3\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 15}{3} = \\frac{32}{3}\\] Not an integer.\n\n\\(y = 2\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 10}{3} = \\frac{37}{3}\\] Not an integer.\n\n\\(y = 1\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 5}{3} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14\\] Integer.\n\nSo, another solution is \\(x = 14\\), \\(y = 1\\), totaling \\(14 + 1 = 15\\) turns.\n\nThis is even more turns.\n\n\\(y = 0\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{47 - 0}{3} = \\frac{47}{3}\\] Not an integer.\n\nSo, the only integer solutions are:\n\n1. \\(x = 4\\), \\(y = 7\\), total turns = 11\n\n2. \\(x = 9\\), \\(y = 4\\), total turns = 13\n\n3. \\(x = 14\\), \\(y = 1\\), total turns = 15\n\nAmong these, the minimum number of turns is 11.\n\nBut, let me double-check if there's a possibility of having fewer turns by some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to use more 5-point turns and fewer 3-point turns to reduce the total turns further below 11.\n\nWait a minute, earlier when \\(y = 7\\), \\(x = 4\\), total turns are 11.\n\nIf I try to increase \\(y\\) to 8, but that gave \\(x = \\frac{7}{3}\\), which is not an integer.\n\nSimilarly, \\(y = 9\\) gives \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\), which is also not an integer.\n\nSo, there are no solutions with \\(y \\geq 7\\) except \\(y = 7\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other combinations that I haven't considered.\n\nLet me consider the general solution to the equation \\(3x + 5y = 47\\).\n\nWe can find particular solutions and then find the general solution.\n\nOne particular solution is \\(x = 4\\), \\(y = 7\\), as we already have.\n\nThe general solution can be written as:\n\n\\[x = 4 + 5k\\]\\[y = 7 - 3k\\]\n\nWhere \\(k\\) is an integer.\n\nNow, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must be non-negative integers.\n\nSo, \\(7 - 3k \\geq 0\\) implies \\(k \\leq \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.333\\), so \\(k \\leq 2\\).\n\nAlso, \\(4 + 5k \\geq 0\\), which is always true for \\(k \\geq 0\\).\n\nSo, possible values of \\(k\\) are 0, 1, 2.\n\nLet's list them:\n\nFor \\(k = 0\\):\n\n\\(x = 4\\), \\(y = 7\\), total turns = 11\n\nFor \\(k = 1\\):\n\n\\(x = 4 + 5(1) = 9\\), \\(y = 7 - 3(1) = 4\\), total turns = 13\n\nFor \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\(x = 4 + 5(2) = 14\\), \\(y = 7 - 3(2) = 1\\), total turns = 15\n\nThese are the same solutions I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns is indeed 11.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to combine 3-point and 5-point turns to get 47 points with fewer than 11 turns.\n\nSuppose there was a way to use more 5-point turns and make up the difference with negative 3-point turns, but that doesn't make sense because turns can't be negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to use fractions of turns, but the problem states that turns are either 3 points or 5 points, implying whole turns.\n\nTherefore, the only possible integer solutions are the ones we've already found, and the minimum number of turns is 11.\n\nWait, but maybe I can check if 47 can be expressed as a combination of 3s and 5s in another way that results in fewer turns.\n\nLet me consider that each 5-point turn saves us \\(5 - 3 = 2\\) points compared to a 3-point turn.\n\nSo, to minimize the number of turns, we should maximize the number of 5-point turns.\n\nLet\u2019s see how many 5-point turns we can have without exceeding 47 points.\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{47}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 9\\]\n\nBut \\(5 \\times 9 = 45\\), which is 2 points short of 47.\n\nSince 2 is not a multiple of 3, we can't make up the difference with 3-point turns.\n\nSo, \\(y = 9\\) is not feasible.\n\nNext, \\(y = 8\\): \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\), leaving \\(47 - 40 = 7\\), which is not a multiple of 3.\n\n\\(y = 7\\): \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\), leaving \\(47 - 35 = 12\\), which is a multiple of 3 (\\(12 / 3 = 4\\)).\n\nSo, \\(y = 7\\), \\(x = 4\\), total turns = 11.\n\nIf we try \\(y = 6\\): \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\), leaving \\(47 - 30 = 17\\), which is not a multiple of 3.\n\n\\(y = 5\\): \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\), leaving \\(47 - 25 = 22\\), not a multiple of 3.\n\n\\(y = 4\\): \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\), leaving \\(47 - 20 = 27\\), which is a multiple of 3 (\\(27 / 3 = 9\\)).\n\nSo, \\(y = 4\\), \\(x = 9\\), total turns = 13.\n\nThis is more than 11 turns.\n\nSimilarly, \\(y = 3\\): \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\), leaving \\(47 - 15 = 32\\), not a multiple of 3.\n\n\\(y = 2\\): \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\), leaving \\(47 - 10 = 37\\), not a multiple of 3.\n\n\\(y = 1\\): \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\), leaving \\(47 - 5 = 42\\), which is a multiple of 3 (\\(42 / 3 = 14\\)).\n\nSo, \\(y = 1\\), \\(x = 14\\), total turns = 15.\n\nAgain, more than 11 turns.\n\n\\(y = 0\\): \\(5 \\times 0 = 0\\), leaving \\(47 - 0 = 47\\), which is not a multiple of 3.\n\nHence, the only feasible solution with the minimum number of turns is \\(y = 7\\), \\(x = 4\\), totaling 11 turns.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns the player took to reach 47 points is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
