        "content": "So there are 50 coins on a table, 10 of them are heads up, and the rest are tails up. I have to divide these coins into two piles with an equal number of heads-up coins, but I'm blindfolded, so I can't see or feel which side is up. That sounds tricky, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what I'm dealing with. There are 50 coins total, with 10 heads up and 40 tails up. I need to create two piles where each pile has the same number of heads. Since there are 10 heads in total, possible equal distributions would be 5 heads in each pile, but I'm not sure if that's the only option. Wait, actually, 5 heads in each pile would be one way to have equal heads, but maybe there are other ways like 4 and 4, or 3 and 3, etc., but the problem doesn't specify how many heads each pile should have, only that they should have an equal number. However, since 10 is an even number, the only way to divide it evenly is to have 5 heads in each pile.\n\nSo, my goal is to create two piles with 5 heads each. The challenge is that I can't see or feel which side is up, so I have to find a method that doesn't rely on knowing which coins are heads or tails.\n\nLet me think about what I can do. I can pick coins at random and manipulate them in some way. Maybe I can flip some coins or separate them into piles in a specific manner.\n\nOne idea is to take a certain number of coins and flip them, then see what happens. But since I can't see, I need a systematic approach.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\n1. I need two piles with an equal number of heads.\n\n2. I can't see or feel which side is up.\n\n3. I can pick coins and possibly flip them.\n\nMaybe I can create one pile with a specific number of coins and then flip all of them. Let's say I create a pile with 10 coins and flip all of them. What would happen?\n\nSuppose the pile of 10 coins has H heads and (10 - H) tails. When I flip them all, the heads become tails, and tails become heads. So, after flipping, the pile would have (10 - H) heads and H tails.\n\nThe remaining 40 coins would have (10 - H) heads and 40 - (10 - H) = (30 + H) tails.\n\nNow, I need the number of heads in both piles to be equal. So, the pile of 10 has (10 - H) heads, and the pile of 40 has (10 - H) heads. That means both piles have the same number of heads, which is (10 - H).\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Is this correct?\n\nLet me check with an example. Suppose H = 2, meaning in the pile of 10, there are 2 heads and 8 tails. After flipping, it becomes 8 heads and 2 tails. The remaining 40 coins have (10 - 2) = 8 heads and 32 tails. So, both piles have 8 heads each. That works.\n\nAnother example: H = 5. Pile of 10 has 5 heads and 5 tails. After flipping, it has 5 tails and 5 heads. Wait, no: flipping all 10 coins would turn the 5 heads into tails and the 5 tails into heads, so it would still have 5 heads. The remaining 40 coins have (10 - 5) = 5 heads. So, both piles have 5 heads each. Still works.\n\nWait, in the first calculation, after flipping, the pile of 10 has (10 - H) heads, and the remaining pile has (10 - H) heads. So, they are equal.\n\nThat seems to be a consistent result. So, by creating a pile of 10 coins and flipping them all, I end up with two piles that have an equal number of heads.\n\nBut why does this work? Let's generalize it.\n\nLet\u2019s say there are N coins in total, with K heads up. I create a pile of M coins and flip them all. After flipping, the pile of M coins will have (M - H) heads, where H is the number of heads in the original M coins. The remaining (N - M) coins will have (K - H) heads.\n\nTo have equal number of heads in both piles, I need:\n\nM - H = K - H\n\nSimplifying, M - H = K - H \u21d2 M = K.\n\nSo, this only works if M = K.\n\nIn my earlier example, N = 50, K = 10, and M = 10, which satisfies M = K.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I thought of taking M = 10 and flipping them, and it seemed to work for any H. But according to this generalization, it only works if M = K.\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nIf M = K, then after flipping the pile of M coins, it will have (M - H) heads, and the remaining pile will have (K - H) heads. Since M = K, both piles have (K - H) heads, which is equal.\n\nBut in my earlier examples, I took M = 10 (same as K), and it worked.\n\nBut the question is, does this method work only if M = K, or is there a different approach?\n\nLet me consider if M \u2260 K.\n\nSuppose N = 50, K = 10, M = 5.\n\nThen, if H is the number of heads in the pile of 5, after flipping, it will have (5 - H) heads.\n\nThe remaining 45 coins will have (10 - H) heads.\n\nFor equality, 5 - H = 10 - H \u21d2 5 = 10, which is not true.\n\nSo, in this case, it doesn't work.\n\nSimilarly, if M = 15, which is greater than K.\n\nThen, after flipping, the pile of 15 has (15 - H) heads, and the remaining 35 have (10 - H) heads.\n\nSetting 15 - H = 10 - H \u21d2 15 = 10, which is false.\n\nSo, only when M = K does this method work.\n\nBut in the problem, K = 10, so I need to create a pile of 10 coins, flip them all, and then I'll have two piles with equal heads.\n\nWait, but in my earlier examples, it seemed to work for M = 10.\n\nBut in the general case, it only works if M = K.\n\nBut in practice, since K is unknown (I don't know how many heads there are), I can't choose M = K because I don't know K.\n\nWait, in this specific problem, I do know K = 10, because it's given that there are 10 heads up coins.\n\nSo, in this case, I can choose M = 10.\n\nBut the method seems to rely on choosing M = K, which in this case is possible because K is known.\n\nBut what if K was unknown? Would this method still work?\n\nIn the general case, if K is unknown, this method wouldn't work because I need to know K to set M = K.\n\nBut in this specific problem, since K is known to be 10, I can proceed.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n1. Separate any 10 coins from the 50 and form a pile with them.\n\n2. Flip all 10 coins in that pile.\n\n3. Leave the remaining 40 coins as another pile.\n\nAfter flipping, both piles will have an equal number of heads.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider different scenarios:\n\n- Suppose the 10 coins I separated had 3 heads and 7 tails.\n\n- After flipping, they become 7 heads and 3 tails.\n\n- The remaining 40 coins have 7 heads and 33 tails.\n\n- So, both piles have 7 heads.\n\n- Another scenario: the 10 coins have 5 heads and 5 tails.\n\n- After flipping, they have 5 tails and 5 heads.\n\n- The remaining 40 coins have 5 heads and 35 tails.\n\n- So, both piles have 5 heads.\n\n- If the 10 coins have all 10 heads.\n\n- After flipping, they have 0 heads.\n\n- The remaining 40 coins have 0 heads.\n\n- So, both piles have 0 heads, which are equal.\n\n- If the 10 coins have 2 heads and 8 tails.\n\n- After flipping, they have 8 heads and 2 tails.\n\n- The remaining 40 coins have 8 heads and 32 tails.\n\n- Both piles have 8 heads.\n\nSo, in all cases, this method ensures that both piles have an equal number of heads.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to separate any 10 coins into a pile, flip all of them, and leave the remaining 40 coins as another pile.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Separate any 10 coins into a pile, flip all of them, and leave the remaining 40 coins as another pile.}} \\]"
