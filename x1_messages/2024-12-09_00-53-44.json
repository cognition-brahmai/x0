        "content": "In business administration, the term \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" refers to creating uncontested market space that makes the competition irrelevant. So, the correct answer is A.\n\nTo elaborate, the Blue Ocean Strategy is a concept introduced by W. Chan Kim and Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne in their book \"Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant.\" The term \"blue ocean\" represents untapped markets or new market spaces, whereas \"red oceans\" are the known markets where competition is fierce.\n\nThe Blue Ocean Strategy encourages companies to stop competing in crowded, red oceans and instead create new demand in blue oceans, where the competition is nonexistent or less intense. This is achieved by simultaneously pursuing differentiation and low cost, which allows companies to break away from the trade-off between cost and quality that often plagues red ocean markets.\n\nOption B describes a penetration pricing strategy, which is about setting low prices to attract customers and gain market share quickly. Option C refers to market segmentation, which is the process of dividing a broad target market into subsets of consumers based on shared characteristics. Option D is akin to price competition within red oceans. Therefore, none of these options accurately define the Blue Ocean Strategy.\n\nIn summary, the Blue Ocean Strategy is about creating new market space and making competition irrelevant, which aligns with option A."
