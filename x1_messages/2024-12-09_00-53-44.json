        "content": "In the meadow where the clover grows,  \nAnd the sun shines bright from morning to close,  \nThere's a farm full of friends, so jolly and free,  \nLiving life with such merriment, just you wait and see.  \n\nFirst there's Mary, the milkmaid so fair,  \nWith her pail on her arm, and her hair in a braid.  \nShe milks the cows with a gentle touch,  \nAnd they low in content, it's quite such a clutch.  \n\nNext is Jemmy, the jovial pig,  \nWith his curly tail and his mud-loving dig.  \nHe oinks and he rolls, in the dirt he does play,  \nA picture of bliss on this sunny day.  \n\nThen there's Daisy, the dapple-grey mare,  \nWith her mane like a cloud, so soft and so rare.  \nShe gallops around, with a neigh so sweet,  \nBringing joy to all who in the meadow meet.  \n\nDon't forget Samson, the strong farmhand,  \nWith his broad shoulders and his hearty band.  \nHe plows the fields with a sturdy stride,  \nMaking sure that the crops are rightly supplied.  \n\nOver there, Cluckety Hen, so motherly,  \nWith her chicks in tow, oh so rally.  \nShe clucks and she scratches, in search of a treat,  \nWhile her little ones follow, with such sweet feet.  \n\nAnd in the barn, Mr. Whiskers the cat,  \nKeeping the mice at bay, with a flick of his hat.  \nHe purrs and he stretches, in the warm afternoon light,  \nA guardian so stealthy, oh what a sight!  \n\nLast but not least, Old Dog Rover, so true,  \nProtecting the farm, through rain or through dew.  \nHis bark is his alarm, his wag is his cheer,  \nA loyal companion, beyond compare, my dear.  \n\nSo here on the farm, where the animals play,  \nEach has their role, in their own special way.  \nFrom the cows to the pigs, from the horses so grand,  \nTo the chickens and cats, and the dogs on the land.  \n\nIt's a symphony of life, in this pastoral scene,  \nWhere nature and nurture, in harmony convene.  \nCome visit our farm, and you'll see for yourself,  \nA world of wonder, where farm animals dwell."
