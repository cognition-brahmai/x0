        "content": "So, the factory produces 500 units of product A in 8 hours, and we want to know how many units it will produce if it operates for 12 hours at the same rate. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to find out the production rate per hour. If the factory produces 500 units in 8 hours, then the hourly production rate would be 500 units divided by 8 hours. So, 500 divided by 8 is 62.5 units per hour.\n\nNow, if the factory operates for 12 hours at this rate, we can find the total production by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours. So, 62.5 units per hour times 12 hours.\n\nLet me do the math: 62.5 times 12. That should be 750 units.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If in 8 hours they produce 500 units, then in 12 hours, which is 50% more time, they should produce 50% more units. Fifty percent of 500 is 250, so 500 plus 250 should be 750 units. Yeah, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, we could set up a proportion. If 8 hours corresponds to 500 units, then 12 hours corresponds to x units. So, 8/500 = 12/x, or something like that. Wait, actually, it should be 8 hours is to 500 units as 12 hours is to x units. So, 8/500 = 12/x.\n\nWait, no. Actually, that should be 8 hours : 500 units = 12 hours : x units. So, 8/500 = 12/x. But earlier, I calculated it directly using the hourly rate.\n\nLet me try solving this proportion to see if I get the same answer. So, 8/500 = 12/x. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 8x = 500 * 12. So, 8x = 6000. Then, x = 6000 / 8, which is 750 units. Okay, same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, it seems like the factory will produce 750 units in 12 hours at the same production rate.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect production, like maintenance breaks or machinery limitations, but the question says \"at the same production rate,\" so we can assume that the rate remains constant throughout the 12 hours.\n\nAlso, since we're dealing with units of product, which are typically whole numbers, and our calculation gave us exactly 750, we don't need to round anything.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 750 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{750} \\]"
