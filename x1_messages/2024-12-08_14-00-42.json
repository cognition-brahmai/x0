One guard always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You don't know which guard is which, and you can only ask one question to find out which door leads to safety. What do you ask?"

        "content": "This is a classic logic puzzle, and it's a bit tricky because you have to find a way to get reliable information from either guard, even though one tells the truth and the other lies. The key is to ask a question that will give you the correct information about which door leads to safety, regardless of whether you're talking to the truth-teller or the liar.\n\nHere's the strategy: You should ask one of the guards, \"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to safety, what would he say?\" Then, choose the opposite door of what they indicate.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **If you ask the truth-teller:** The truth-teller knows that the liar would point you to the door leading to certain death. So, when you ask what the liar would say, the truth-teller will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the dangerous door.\n\n2. **If you ask the liar:** The liar knows that the truth-teller would point you to the safe door. But since the liar lies, he would tell you that the truth-teller would point to the dangerous door.\n\nIn both cases, the guard you ask will point to the dangerous door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure you go through the one leading to safety.\n\nThis question is\u5de7\u5999 because it forces both guards to point you towards the dangerous door, allowing you to confidently choose the other one."
