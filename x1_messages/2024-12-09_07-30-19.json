        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. I have a standard deck of 52 cards, and among those, there are 4 aces. The question is, if I draw 5 cards at random without putting any back, what's the probability that exactly 2 of those cards are aces?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember how to approach probability problems, especially those involving combinations since the order in which I draw the cards doesn't matter here.\n\nSo, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to draw exactly 2 aces out of 5 cards, and the total outcomes are all the possible ways to draw any 5 cards from the deck.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Total number of ways to draw 5 cards from 52: that's the combination of 52 cards taken 5 at a time, which is C(52,5).\n\n- Number of ways to draw exactly 2 aces: that would be the number of ways to choose 2 aces from the 4 available aces, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 cards from the non-aces.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the number of ways to choose 2 aces from 4 is C(4,2), and the number of ways to choose 3 non-aces from the remaining 48 cards (since there are 52 - 4 = 48 non-aces) is C(48,3).\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2) * C(48,3).\n\nSo, the probability P should be:\n\nP = [C(4,2) * C(48,3)] / C(52,5)\n\nNow, I need to calculate these combinations. Let's recall that the combination formula is:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nFirst, calculate C(4,2):\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 2 * 1) = (24) / (4) = 6\n\nNext, calculate C(48,3):\n\nC(48,3) = 48! / (3! * (48 - 3)!) = (48 * 47 * 46 * 45!) / (6 * 45!)) = (48 * 47 * 46) / 6\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n48 * 47 = 2256\n\n2256 * 46 = 103776\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n103776 / 6 = 17296\n\nSo, C(48,3) = 17296\n\nNow, calculate C(52,5):\n\nC(52,5) = 52! / (5! * (52 - 5)!) = (52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48 * 47!) / (120 * 47!)) = (52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48) / 120\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\n52 * 51 = 2652\n\n2652 * 50 = 132600\n\n132600 * 49 = 6500400\n\n6500400 * 48 = 312019200\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n312019200 / 120 = 2600160\n\nSo, C(52,5) = 2598960\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, actually, 52 choose 5 is a known combination, and it's equal to 2,598,960. I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n52 * 51 = 2652\n\n2652 * 50 = 132,600\n\n132,600 * 49 = 6,500,400\n\n6,500,400 * 48 = 312,019,200\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n312,019,200 / 120 = 2,600,160\n\nWait, but I know that C(52,5) is 2,598,960. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach to calculate C(52,5).\n\nLet me try calculating C(52,5) step by step:\n\nC(52,5) = 52! / (5! * 47!)\n\nNow, 52! is a huge number, but we can simplify this:\n\nC(52,5) = (52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = (52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48) / 120\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n52 * 51 = 2,652\n\n2,652 * 50 = 132,600\n\n132,600 * 49 = 6,500,400\n\n6,500,400 * 48 = 312,019,200\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n312,019,200 / 120 = 2,600,160\n\nBut I recall that C(52,5) is 2,598,960. There must be a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use another method. Let's see:\n\nC(52,5) can also be calculated as C(52,5) = C(51,4) + C(51,5)\n\nBut that seems more complicated. Maybe I should look up the exact value.\n\nRegardless, for the sake of this problem, I'll proceed with C(52,5) = 2,598,960, as I know that's the correct value.\n\nNow, moving back to the probability formula:\n\nP = [C(4,2) * C(48,3)] / C(52,5) = (6 * 17,296) / 2,598,960\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n6 * 17,296 = 103,776\n\nSo, P = 103,776 / 2,598,960\n\nNow, simplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n103,776 \u00f7 16 = 6,486\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 16 = 162,435\n\nSo, P = 6,486 / 162,435\n\nCan this be simplified further? Let's check.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n6,486 \u00f7 3 = 2,162\n\n162,435 \u00f7 3 = 54,145\n\nSo, P = 2,162 / 54,145\n\nIs this the simplest form? Let's check if 2,162 and 54,145 have any common factors.\n\n2,162 divided by 2 is 1,081, and 54,145 is not even, so no.\n\n1,081 is a prime number, and 54,145 divided by 1,081 is approximately 50.07, which is not an integer.\n\nSo, the fraction 2,162 / 54,145 is in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, it's often more straightforward to leave it as is or convert it to a decimal for a better understanding of the probability.\n\nLet's convert it to a decimal:\n\nP \u2248 2,162 / 54,145 \u2248 0.03996\n\nSo, approximately 0.04, or 4%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly 2 aces in a 5-card hand is about 4%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, C(4,2) = 6, that's correct.\n\nC(48,3) = 17,296, that seems correct.\n\nC(52,5) = 2,598,960, that's correct.\n\nThen, P = (6 * 17,296) / 2,598,960 = 103,776 / 2,598,960.\n\nSimplifying:\n\n103,776 \u00f7 16 = 6,486\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 16 = 162,435\n\nThen, 6,486 \u00f7 3 = 2,162\n\n162,435 \u00f7 3 = 54,145\n\nSo, P = 2,162 / 54,145.\n\nDividing these gives approximately 0.03996, which is about 4%.\n\nAlternatively, to express it as a percentage, it's roughly 4%.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 4%.\n\nJust to cross-verify, I can consider that in a standard deck, the chance of getting exactly 2 aces in a 5-card hand should indeed be around 4%, given that there are only 4 aces in the deck.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of drawing exactly 2 aces in a 5-card hand from a standard deck of 52 cards is \\boxed{\\dfrac{2162}{54145}} or approximately 0.03996, which is about 4%."
