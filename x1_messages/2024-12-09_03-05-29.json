        "content": "So a car factory makes 150 cars each day, and you want to know how many cars it would make in a leap year. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a leap year is. A leap year has 366 days instead of the usual 365 days. This extra day is added to February, making it 29 days long instead of 28.\n\nNow, since the factory produces cars every day, we need to find out how many days there are in a leap year and then multiply that by the daily production rate.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of days in a leap year.\nAs mentioned, a leap year has 366 days.\n\nStep 2: Find out the daily production of cars.\nThe factory produces 150 cars each day.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total production for the leap year.\nTo do this, we multiply the number of days in a leap year by the daily production rate.\n\nSo, total cars produced in a leap year = number of days in a leap year \u00d7 daily production rate\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal cars = 366 days \u00d7 150 cars/day\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication.\n\n366 \u00d7 150\n\nTo make this easier, we can break it down:\n\n366 \u00d7 100 = 36,600\n\n366 \u00d7 50 = 18,300\n\nNow, add these two results together:\n\n36,600 + 18,300 = 54,900\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 54,900 cars in a leap year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n366 \u00d7 150 = 366 \u00d7 (100 + 50) = (366 \u00d7 100) + (366 \u00d7 50) = 36,600 + 18,300 = 54,900\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to verify is to consider that 365 days would be 365 \u00d7 150, which is 54,750, and adding one extra day's production of 150 cars would bring the total to 54,900.\n\nSo, yes, 54,900 cars in a leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54900} \\]"
