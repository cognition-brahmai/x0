        "content": "Let's see here. So, we have a train that's moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. It takes 3 hours to go from Town A to Town B. Now, we need to find out how long it would take to get from Town A to Town C, where Town C is twice as far away from Town A as Town B is.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the distance from Town A to Town B. Since speed is 60 miles per hour and time is 3 hours, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, distance from A to B is 60 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nNow, Town C is twice as far away from Town A as Town B, so the distance from A to C is 2 \u00d7 180 miles = 360 miles.\n\nThe train is still moving at the same constant speed of 60 miles per hour, so to find the time it takes to travel from A to C, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time from A to C is 360 miles / 60 miles per hour = 6 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me make sure I have the right distances. From A to B is 180 miles, and C is twice that distance from A, so indeed 360 miles.\n\nAnd the speed remains constant at 60 miles per hour, so time should be distance divided by speed.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, it would take 6 hours to get from A to C.\n\nBut maybe there's something else to consider, like whether the train makes stops or anything, but the problem doesn't mention any stops, so I think constant speed means it's moving non-stop.\n\nAlso, the train's speed is constant, so no acceleration or deceleration to worry about.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
