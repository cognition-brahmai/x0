        "content": "Mercury, also known as quicksilver, is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature. It has the chemical symbol Hg and atomic number 80. Its unique property of being a liquid at standard temperature and pressure makes it distinct from other metals, which are typically solid under these conditions. Mercury's unusual state of matter at room temperature is due to its electronic configuration and interatomic forces, which allow its atoms to move freely past one another, thus existing in a liquid state."
