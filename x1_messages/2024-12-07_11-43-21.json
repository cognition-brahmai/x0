        "content": "To calculate the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of all three sides, you can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{a + b + c}{2}\n\\]\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Calculate the semi-perimeter\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    return area\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing the lengths of the sides of the triangle as arguments. For example:\n\n```python\narea = triangle_area(3, 4, 5)\nprint(area)  # Output: 6.0\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the given side lengths form a valid triangle. If the side lengths do not form a valid triangle, the function may attempt to calculate the square root of a negative number, which would result in a `ValueError`. To handle such cases, you might want to add a check to ensure that the side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n\nHere's an enhanced version of the function that includes such a check:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid triangle side lengths\")\n    # Calculate the semi-perimeter\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    return area\n```\n\nWith this enhancement, if you pass side lengths that do not form a valid triangle, the function will raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message."
