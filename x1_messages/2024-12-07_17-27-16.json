        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a basketball player makes 70% of his free throws, and he's taking 15 free throws in a game. I need to find the probability that he makes exactly 10 of them. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that each free throw is an independent event, meaning the outcome of one doesn't affect the others. The player has a 70% chance of making each one, so the probability of making a free throw is 0.7, and the probability of missing is 0.3.\n\nSince we're dealing with a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes (make or miss), and we're interested in the number of successes, this sounds like a binomial distribution problem.\n\nThe formula for the binomial probability is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C(n,k) \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (15 free throws),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successes we're interested in (10 made free throws),\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (0.7),\n\n- \\( C(n,k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(10) = C(15,10) \\times 0.7^{10} \\times 0.3^{5} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( C(15,10) \\). The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ C(15,10) = \\frac{15!}{10! \\times 5!} \\]\n\nCalculating factorials can be time-consuming, but I can simplify this:\n\n\\[ C(15,10) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{10! \\times 5!} \\]\n\nThe \\( 10! \\) cancels out:\n\n\\[ C(15,10) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{5!} \\]\n\nNow, \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\), so:\n\n\\[ C(15,10) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{120} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 14 = 210 \\]\n\n\\[ 210 \\times 13 = 2730 \\]\n\n\\[ 2730 \\times 12 = 32760 \\]\n\n\\[ 32760 \\times 11 = 360360 \\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[ C(15,10) = \\frac{360360}{120} = 3003 \\]\n\nSo, there are 3003 combinations of making 10 out of 15 free throws.\n\nNext, I need to calculate \\( 0.7^{10} \\) and \\( 0.3^{5} \\).\n\nFirst, \\( 0.7^{10} \\):\n\n\\[ 0.7^2 = 0.49 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.7^4 = 0.49^2 = 0.2401 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.7^8 = 0.2401^2 = 0.05764801 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.7^{10} = 0.7^8 \\times 0.7^2 = 0.05764801 \\times 0.49 = 0.0282475249 \\]\n\nNow, \\( 0.3^{5} \\):\n\n\\[ 0.3^2 = 0.09 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3^4 = 0.09^2 = 0.0081 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3^5 = 0.0081 \\times 0.3 = 0.00243 \\]\n\nNow, multiply all parts together:\n\n\\[ P(10) = 3003 \\times 0.0282475249 \\times 0.00243 \\]\n\nFirst, multiply \\( 0.0282475249 \\times 0.00243 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.0282475249 \\times 0.00243 = 0.000068602145807 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 3003:\n\n\\[ 3003 \\times 0.000068602145807 = 0.2059322944 \\]\n\nSo, the probability of making exactly 10 out of 15 free throws is approximately 0.2059, or 20.59%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting again with \\( C(15,10) \\):\n\n\\[ C(15,10) = \\frac{15!}{10! \\times 5!} = 3003 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, \\( 0.7^{10} \\):\n\n\\[ 0.7^2 = 0.49 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.7^4 = 0.49^2 = 0.2401 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.7^8 = 0.2401^2 = 0.05764801 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.7^{10} = 0.05764801 \\times 0.49 = 0.0282475249 \\]\n\nCorrect.\n\n\\( 0.3^5 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.3^2 = 0.09 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3^4 = 0.09^2 = 0.0081 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3^5 = 0.0081 \\times 0.3 = 0.00243 \\]\n\nCorrect.\n\nNow, multiplying them together:\n\n\\[ P(10) = 3003 \\times 0.0282475249 \\times 0.00243 \\]\n\nLet me verify the multiplication:\n\nFirst, \\( 0.0282475249 \\times 0.00243 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.0282475249 \\times 0.00243 = 0.000068602145807 \\]\n\nThen, \\( 3003 \\times 0.000068602145807 \\):\n\n\\[ 3003 \\times 0.000068602145807 = 0.2059322944 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 20.59%.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a calculator or software to compute the binomial probability directly, but since the question seems to be about understanding the process, I think walking through the formula step by step is appropriate.\n\nSo, the final answer is that there's about a 20.59% chance that the player makes exactly 10 out of 15 free throws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2059} \\]"
