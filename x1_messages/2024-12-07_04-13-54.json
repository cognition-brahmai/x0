        "content": "The painting technique that uses small dots of color to create an image when viewed from a distance is called Pointillism. This method was developed in the late 19th century by artists such as Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. In Pointillism, the artist applies tiny dots or strokes of pure color side by side, allowing the viewer's eye to mix the colors optically rather than mixing them physically on the palette. This technique can create a sense of vibrancy and luminosity in the artwork."
