        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have two products: Product A and Product B. Each has its own profit margin, selling price, and number of units sold. We need to find the total profit from selling both.\n\nFirst, let's understand what profit margin means. The profit margin is the percentage of the selling price that is profit. For Product A, the profit margin is 25%, which means for every dollar sold, 25 cents is profit. Similarly, for Product B, the profit margin is 35%, meaning 35 cents profit per dollar sold.\n\nNow, let's find out the profit per unit for each product.\n\nFor Product A:\n\nSelling price per unit: $10\n\nProfit margin: 25%\n\nProfit per unit of A = 25% of $10 = 0.25 * 10 = $2.50\n\nFor Product B:\n\nSelling price per unit: $15\n\nProfit margin: 35%\n\nProfit per unit of B = 35% of $15 = 0.35 * 15 = $5.25\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total profit for each product based on the number of units sold.\n\nFor Product A:\n\nUnits sold: 120\n\nProfit per unit: $2.50\n\nTotal profit from A = 120 * 2.50 = $300\n\nFor Product B:\n\nUnits sold: 80\n\nProfit per unit: $5.25\n\nTotal profit from B = 80 * 5.25 = $420\n\nFinally, to find the total profit from both products, we add the profits together.\n\nTotal profit = Profit from A + Profit from B = $300 + $420 = $720\n\nSo, the total profit made from selling both products is $720.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720} \\]"
