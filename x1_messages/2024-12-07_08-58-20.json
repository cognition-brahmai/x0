        "content": "Ah, you're referring to Led Zeppelin's fourth studio album, which is often called \"Led Zeppelin IV.\" It was released in 1971, and it features the iconic track \"Stairway to Heaven.\" The album is notable for its minimalist artwork, which is just the band's name embossed on the cover, and it's considered one of the greatest albums in rock history. So, to answer your question directly, the band is Led Zeppelin, and the album is their fourth, though it doesn't have a formal title beyond that."
