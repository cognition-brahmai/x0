        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 5x - 3 = 2x + 4. I need to find out what x is. Okay, let's start by looking at what's being asked here. It's a linear equation, so I shouldn't have to worry about exponents or anything like that. Just straightforward solving for x.\n\nFirst, I think I should try to get all the x terms on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. That's usually the way to go with these kinds of problems. So, let's see, if I have 5x on the left and 2x on the right, maybe I can subtract 2x from both sides to start.\n\nSo, if I subtract 2x from both sides, I get:\n\n5x - 2x - 3 = 2x - 2x + 4\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3x - 3 = 4\n\nOkay, now I have 3x - 3 = 4. Next, I probably want to isolate the x term by getting rid of the -3 on the left side. I can do that by adding 3 to both sides.\n\nSo, adding 3 to both sides:\n\n3x - 3 + 3 = 4 + 3\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3x = 7\n\nNow, I have 3x = 7. To solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 3.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 7 / 3\n\nThat gives me:\n\nx = 7/3\n\nAlright, so x equals 7/3. But let me just double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I'll plug x = 7/3 back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nStarting with the left side: 5x - 3\n\n5*(7/3) - 3 = (35/3) - 3 = (35/3) - (9/3) = 26/3\n\nNow, the right side: 2x + 4\n\n2*(7/3) + 4 = (14/3) + 4 = (14/3) + (12/3) = 26/3\n\nOkay, both sides equal 26/3, so that checks out. Looks like I did it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x = \\dfrac{7}{3}} \\]"
