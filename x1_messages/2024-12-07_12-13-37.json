        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a bottle holds 500 ml of water, and I need to figure out how many of these bottles would be needed to fill up a tank that can hold 50 liters of water. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that both quantities are in the same units so that I can compare them easily. Right now, the bottle's capacity is in milliliters (ml), and the tank's capacity is in liters (l). I know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. So, I should convert either the bottle's capacity to liters or the tank's capacity to milliliters. Maybe it's easier to convert the tank's capacity to milliliters since 50 liters is a bigger number and converting it to milliliters might make the multiplication clearer.\n\nSo, 1 liter = 1000 ml\n\nTherefore, 50 liters = 50 * 1000 ml = 50,000 ml\n\nNow, the tank can hold 50,000 ml of water.\n\nEach bottle holds 500 ml.\n\nTo find out how many bottles are needed to fill the tank, I should divide the total volume of the tank by the volume of one bottle.\n\nSo, number of bottles = total volume of tank / volume of one bottle\n\nNumber of bottles = 50,000 ml / 500 ml\n\nNow, let's do the division.\n\n50,000 divided by 500.\n\nWell, 500 times 10 is 5,000.\n\n500 times 100 is 50,000.\n\nSo, 500 * 100 = 50,000.\n\nTherefore, 50,000 / 500 = 100.\n\nSo, you would need 100 bottles to fill up the tank.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf one bottle is 500 ml, and the tank is 50 liters, which is 50,000 ml, then 100 bottles would be 100 * 500 = 50,000 ml, which matches the tank's capacity.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had converted the bottle's capacity to liters instead of the tank's capacity to milliliters, let's see if I get the same answer.\n\nBottle capacity: 500 ml = 0.5 liters\n\nTank capacity: 50 liters\n\nNumber of bottles = 50 / 0.5\n\n50 divided by 0.5 is the same as 50 * 2 = 100.\n\nAgain, 100 bottles.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign that I'm correct.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nMaybe using proportions.\n\nIf 1 bottle = 500 ml,\n\nThen x bottles = 50,000 ml\n\nSo, x = (50,000 ml) * (1 bottle / 500 ml) = 50,000 / 500 = 100 bottles.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nOr, thinking about it in terms of factors.\n\n500 ml is half a liter, so 100 bottles would be 100 * 0.5 liters = 50 liters.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough.\n\nSo, the final answer is 100 bottles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
