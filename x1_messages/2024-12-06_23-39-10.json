        "content": "So I have this problem here: there's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. I need to find the probability of picking a red ball without looking. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the bag.\n\nLet me count the total number of balls. There are 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green. So, total balls = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls, which is 5.\n\nSo, probability of picking a red ball = number of red balls / total number of balls = 5 / 10 = 0.5.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there any other way to look at this?\n\nAnother way to think about probability is to use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of equally likely outcomes).\n\nIn this scenario, each ball is equally likely to be picked since I'm picking without looking. So, yes, the total number of equally likely outcomes is indeed the total number of balls, which is 10.\n\nAnd the number of favorable outcomes is 5, since there are 5 red balls.\n\nSo, probability = 5/10 = 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, this can be expressed as a fraction, 1/2, or as a percentage, 50%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there anything in the problem that suggests the balls are not equally likely to be picked? For example, maybe the balls are of different sizes or something, but the problem doesn't mention that. It says \"picking a red ball from the bag without looking,\" which generally implies that each ball has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nAlso, is there replacement or not? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's just picking one ball, I don't think replacement is a factor here.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is indeed 0.5, or 50%.\n\nLet me write it down clearly.\n\nTotal number of balls = 5 red + 3 blue + 2 green = 10 balls.\n\nNumber of red balls = 5.\n\nProbability of picking a red ball = 5/10 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nYes, that should be it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
