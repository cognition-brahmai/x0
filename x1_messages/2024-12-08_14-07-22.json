        "content": "So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 120 miles away, and it takes 2 hours to get there. So, first, I need to figure out how fast the train is going. Speed is usually calculated by dividing the distance by the time, right? So, speed equals distance divided by time.\n\nSo, speed = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour. That means the train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the question is, how long would it take for the same train to travel 60 miles at the same constant speed? So, I need to find out the time it takes to cover 60 miles at 60 miles per hour.\n\nTime is equal to distance divided by speed, right? So, time = 60 miles / 60 miles per hour = 1 hour.\n\nSo, it would take the train 1 hour to travel 60 miles at the same constant speed.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If the train is going 60 miles per hour, that means it covers 60 miles in one hour. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using proportions or something like that.\n\nOkay, let's see. If 120 miles takes 2 hours, then 60 miles should take half the time, since it's half the distance and the speed is constant.\n\nHalf of 2 hours is 1 hour, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the answer is 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
