        "content": "So I've got this problem about planning hiking trails in a national park. The total distance of all trails combined needs to be 100 miles, and they're divided into three levels: easy, moderate, and difficult. There are some constraints: easy trails should make up at least 40% of the total distance, and difficult trails can't be more than 20% of the total distance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these percentages mean in terms of miles. Since the total distance is 100 miles, 40% of that is 40 miles. So, easy trails must be at least 40 miles. Similarly, 20% of 100 miles is 20 miles, so difficult trails can't exceed 20 miles.\n\nLet me define variables for each trail level to make it easier to work with:\n\n- Let E be the distance of easy trails in miles.\n\n- Let M be the distance of moderate trails in miles.\n\n- Let D be the distance of difficult trails in miles.\n\nThe total distance is E + M + D = 100 miles.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. E \u2265 40 miles (since easy trails must be at least 40% of 100 miles).\n\n2. D \u2264 20 miles (difficult trails can't exceed 20% of 100 miles).\n\nI need to find all possible combinations of E, M, and D that satisfy these conditions.\n\nFirst, from the total distance equation:\n\nE + M + D = 100.\n\nI can express one variable in terms of the others. For example, M = 100 - E - D.\n\nNow, considering the constraints:\n\nE \u2265 40,\n\nD \u2264 20.\n\nSince E and D have direct constraints, I can consider their possible ranges.\n\nFirst, E can be from 40 to some maximum value. But there's no upper limit specified for E, except that E + D cannot exceed 100 miles because M has to be non-negative.\n\nSimilarly, D can be from 0 to 20 miles.\n\nBut I also need to ensure that M is non-negative, so M = 100 - E - D \u2265 0.\n\nSo, E + D \u2264 100.\n\nGiven that E \u2265 40 and D \u2264 20, let's see what possible values E and D can take.\n\nFirst, the minimum E is 40, and the maximum D is 20.\n\nIf E = 40 and D = 20, then M = 100 - 40 - 20 = 40 miles.\n\nIf E = 40 and D = 0, then M = 100 - 40 - 0 = 60 miles.\n\nIf E = 60 and D = 20, then M = 100 - 60 - 20 = 20 miles.\n\nIf E = 80 and D = 20, then M = 100 - 80 - 20 = 0 miles. But M cannot be zero unless specified otherwise. However, the problem doesn't say that all three levels must be present, so M = 0 is acceptable.\n\nSo, E can range from 40 to 80 miles (since if E = 80 and D = 20, M = 0).\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\nIf E = 80 and D = 20, M = 0, which is acceptable.\n\nIf E = 80 and D = 10, M = 100 - 80 - 10 = 10 miles.\n\nIf E = 40 and D = 20, M = 40 miles.\n\nIf E = 50 and D = 15, M = 35 miles.\n\nSo, as long as E \u2265 40 and D \u2264 20, and E + D \u2264 100, any combination is possible.\n\nAlternatively, since M = 100 - E - D, and M \u2265 0, then E + D \u2264 100.\n\nBut E \u2265 40 and D \u2264 20, so E can be up to 80 miles (when D = 20), and D can be from 0 to 20 miles, with E adjusting accordingly to ensure E + D \u2264 100.\n\nWait, but E can be up to 80 miles only if D = 20 miles. If D is less than 20, E can be higher.\n\nFor example, if D = 0, E can be up to 100 miles, but E must be at least 40 miles.\n\nWait, but the total is 100 miles, so if D = 0 and E = 100, then M = 0.\n\nBut the constraint is E \u2265 40, D \u2264 20, and E + D \u2264 100.\n\nWait a minute, but if E = 100 and D = 0, that satisfies E \u2265 40 and D \u2264 20, and E + D = 100 \u2264 100.\n\nSo, E can be from 40 to 100 miles, but with the condition that if E is more than 80, D must be less than 20 accordingly.\n\nWait, no. If D is at most 20, and E can be up to 100 - D, but D can be as low as 0.\n\nSo, E can be from 40 to 100 miles, and D can be from 0 to 20 miles, as long as E + D \u2264 100.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of ranges:\n\n- E \u2208 [40, 100] miles\n\n- D \u2208 [0, 20] miles\n\n- M = 100 - E - D \u2265 0\n\nSo, the combination of E and D must satisfy E + D \u2264 100.\n\nGiven E \u2265 40 and D \u2264 20, the possible combinations are:\n\n- E from 40 to 100 miles\n\n- D from 0 to min(20, 100 - E) miles\n\n- M = 100 - E - D miles\n\nSo, for each E from 40 to 100 miles, D can be from 0 to min(20, 100 - E) miles, and M is determined accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since D cannot exceed 20 miles, and E must be at least 40 miles, the maximum E is when D = 20, so E = 100 - D - M.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the constraints step by step.\n\nFirst constraint: E \u2265 40.\n\nSecond constraint: D \u2264 20.\n\nThird constraint: E + M + D = 100, with M \u2265 0.\n\nFrom the third constraint, M = 100 - E - D \u2265 0 \u21d2 E + D \u2264 100.\n\nSo, combining E \u2265 40 and D \u2264 20, and E + D \u2264 100.\n\nSo, E can be from 40 to 100 miles.\n\nBut if E is greater than 80, D must be less than or equal to 20, but also E + D \u2264 100.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If E = 40, D can be from 0 to 60 miles, but D \u2264 20, so D can be from 0 to 20 miles.\n\n- If E = 50, D can be from 0 to 50 miles, but D \u2264 20, so D can be from 0 to 20 miles.\n\n- If E = 60, D can be from 0 to 40 miles, but D \u2264 20, so D can be from 0 to 20 miles.\n\n- If E = 70, D can be from 0 to 30 miles, but D \u2264 20, so D can be from 0 to 20 miles.\n\n- If E = 80, D can be from 0 to 20 miles, and D \u2264 20, so D can be from 0 to 20 miles.\n\n- If E = 90, D can be from 0 to 10 miles, but D \u2264 20, so D can be from 0 to 10 miles.\n\n- If E = 100, D can be only 0 miles, since E + D \u2264 100.\n\nWait, so for E from 40 to 80, D can be from 0 to 20 miles, as long as E + D \u2264 100.\n\nBut for E from 80 to 100, D is limited by D \u2264 100 - E.\n\nSo, to generalize:\n\n- For E from 40 to 80 miles, D can be from 0 to 20 miles, as long as E + D \u2264 100.\n\n- For E from 80 to 100 miles, D can be from 0 to 100 - E miles, but also D \u2264 20 miles.\n\nWait, but 100 - E when E is from 80 to 100 is from 20 to 0 miles.\n\nSo, for E from 80 to 100:\n\n- When E = 80, D can be from 0 to 20 miles.\n\n- When E = 90, D can be from 0 to 10 miles.\n\n- When E = 100, D can be only 0 miles.\n\nBut since D \u2264 20 miles is already a constraint, it's covered.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- E can be from 40 to 100 miles.\n\n- D can be from 0 to min(20, 100 - E) miles.\n\n- M = 100 - E - D miles.\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations are all sets of E, M, D where:\n\n- E is at least 40 miles.\n\n- D is at most 20 miles.\n\n- E + D \u2264 100 miles.\n\n- M = 100 - E - D \u2265 0.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n- E from 40 to 100 miles.\n\n- For each E:\n\n- If E \u2264 80, D can be from 0 to 20 miles.\n\n- If E > 80, D can be from 0 to 100 - E miles, but not exceeding 20 miles.\n\nAlternatively, since 100 - E when E > 80 is less than 20, so D \u2264 100 - E and D \u2264 20.\n\nSo, D \u2264 min(20, 100 - E).\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations are all triples (E, D, M) where:\n\n- E \u2208 [40, 100]\n\n- D \u2208 [0, min(20, 100 - E)]\n\n- M = 100 - E - D\n\nThis gives the full range of possible combinations that satisfy the given constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{All combinations where } E \\geq 40, \\, D \\leq 20, \\, \\text{and } E + D \\leq 100 \\text{ with } M = 100 - E - D \\geq 0}"
