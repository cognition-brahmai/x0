        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing basketball and soccer. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 40 students in total. Out of these, 14 play basketball, 20 play soccer, and 12 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm a bit rusty on set theory, but I think I can manage.\n\nFirst, I know that if some students play both sports, they are counted in both the basketball and soccer groups. So, to find out how many students play at least one of the sports, I need to add the number of basketball and soccer players and then subtract those who play both, to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, the number of students who play at least one sport would be:\n\nNumber playing basketball + number playing soccer - number playing both.\n\nThat would be 14 + 20 - 12 = 22 students.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that calculation.\n\n14 plus 20 is 34, minus 12 is 22. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 22 students play at least one of the two sports.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I should subtract the number of students who play at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nThat would be 40 - 22 = 18 students.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure if I've done this correctly. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nMaybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nIn this case, the union of basketball and soccer players would be the total number of students who play at least one sport.\n\nSo, |B \u222a S| = |B| + |S| - |B \u2229 S|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |B| is the number of basketball players (14)\n\n- |S| is the number of soccer players (20)\n\n- |B \u2229 S| is the number of students who play both sports (12)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|B \u222a S| = 14 + 20 - 12 = 22\n\nAgain, I get 22 students playing at least one sport.\n\nThen, the number of students who don't play either sport is the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport:\n\n40 - 22 = 18\n\nThis matches my previous result. So, it seems like 18 students don't play either sport.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I make a Venn diagram with two circles, one for basketball and one for soccer.\n\nThe intersection of the two circles represents students who play both sports, which is 12 students.\n\nThen, the part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap with soccer would be basketball players who don't play soccer, which is 14 - 12 = 2 students.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the soccer circle that doesn't overlap with basketball would be soccer players who don't play basketball, which is 20 - 12 = 8 students.\n\nSo, in total, students who play at least one sport are:\n\n2 (only basketball) + 8 (only soccer) + 12 (both) = 22 students.\n\nAgain, this confirms that 22 students play at least one sport, and 40 - 22 = 18 students play neither.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are students who play other sports not mentioned here. The problem says \"basketball and soccer,\" but maybe some students play other sports that aren't basketball or soccer.\n\nHowever, the problem is specifically asking about students who don't play either basketball or soccer. It doesn't mention other sports, so I think it's safe to assume that even if some students play other sports, they still wouldn't be playing basketball or soccer, so they would be included in the \"neither\" category.\n\nSo, my final answer is 18 students do not play either sport.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of overlap or miscounting.\n\nI used the inclusion-exclusion principle, which is a standard method for this type of problem, and the Venn diagram approach, which visually confirms the calculation. Both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 18 is the correct number of students who do not play either basketball or soccer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
