        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 25 students, and 60% of them are girls. First, I need to find out how many girls there are.\n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 60% of 25:\n\nNumber of girls = 60% of 25 = (60/100) * 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 girls in the class.\n\nNow, the problem says that each girl has 2 brothers in the class. Hmm, that's interesting. So, each of these 15 girls has 2 brothers. At first glance, you might think that means there are 15 * 2 = 30 brothers. But wait a minute, that can't be right because the class only has 25 students, and we've already established that 15 of them are girls. So, if there were 30 brothers, that would make the total number of students 15 girls + 30 boys = 45, which is more than the class size.\n\nClearly, there's something wrong with that approach. The issue is that the brothers are shared among the girls. In other words, the brothers are counted multiple times because each girl has the same brothers.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Let's consider that all these girls share the same 2 brothers. That would mean there are only 2 boys in the class who are brothers to all the girls.\n\nBut wait, if there are 2 boys who are brothers to all the girls, does that make sense in terms of family relationships? Well, in terms of the problem, it's possible that all the girls are related to these 2 boys as their brothers.\n\nHowever, I need to verify if this fits with the total number of students.\n\nWe have 15 girls and 2 boys, which totals 17 students. But the class has 25 students. So, 17 is less than 25, which means there are additional students who are not accounted for in this scenario.\n\nHmm, maybe the brothers are not shared among all the girls, but each girl has her own 2 brothers in the class. But that would lead to a large number of boys, which we've already seen doesn't work because the class only has 25 students.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the girls have some brothers in common and some that are unique to them, but that seems complicated.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's think about the total number of brothers that all the girls have.\n\nEach girl has 2 brothers, and there are 15 girls, so if we naively multiply, we get 15 * 2 = 30 brothers. But again, that's more than the total number of students, which is not possible.\n\nThis suggests that the brothers are being counted multiple times because they are shared among the girls.\n\nTo find the actual number of distinct brothers, I need to account for this overlapping.\n\nLet me consider that each boy is a brother to some of the girls.\n\nIf a boy is a brother to multiple girls, he will be counted multiple times in the total of 30 brothers.\n\nSo, the actual number of boys is less than 30, and it depends on how many girls each boy is a brother to.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can think in terms of family groups.\n\nSuppose there are families where each family has some girls and some boys, and all siblings are in the class.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about families, so maybe that's not the right way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the class consists of multiple families, and within each family, the children are related to each other.\n\nBut again, without more information, that might not help.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently.\n\nSuppose there are B boys in the class.\n\nEach girl has 2 brothers, who are boys in the class.\n\nSo, for each girl, there are 2 boys who are her brothers.\n\nBut since brothers are shared among girls, I need to find a way to relate the total number of \"brother relationships\" to the actual number of boys.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each boy is counted as a brother.\n\nIf a boy has S sisters (who are girls in the class), then he is counted as a brother S times.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each girl has 2 brothers in the class.\n\nSo, for each girl, there are 2 brothers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of \"brother relationships\" is 15 girls * 2 brothers/girl = 30 brother relationships.\n\nNow, each boy is counted in multiple brother relationships, depending on how many sisters he has.\n\nIf a boy has S sisters in the class, then he is counted S times in the total brother relationships.\n\nSo, the total number of brother relationships is equal to the sum of the number of sisters each boy has.\n\nLet B be the number of boys in the class.\n\nEach boy has (total girls - number of his sisters) sisters, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. If a boy has S sisters in the class, then he is counted S times in the total brother relationships.\n\nTherefore, the total number of brother relationships is equal to the sum of S for all boys.\n\nBut I don't know S for each boy.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nB = number of boys in the class.\n\nEach girl has 2 brothers, so total brother relationships = 15 * 2 = 30.\n\nEach boy is counted in S brother relationships, where S is the number of sisters he has.\n\nBut since all siblings are in the class, S for each boy would be the number of girls in his family who are in the class.\n\nWait, but again, without knowing the family structure, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assuming that the brothers are shared among all the girls, meaning that all girls have the same 2 brothers.\n\nIn that case, B = 2.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that 15 girls + 2 boys = 17 students, which is less than the class size of 25.\n\nSo, there are 25 - 17 = 8 additional students who are neither brothers to the girls nor related in any specified way.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any other relationships, so perhaps this is not the right assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more boys who are not brothers to any of the girls, but the problem states that \"each girl has 2 brothers in the class,\" which seems to imply that all boys in the class are brothers to at least some of the girls.\n\nBut that might not be the case, as there could be boys who are not related to any of the girls.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"each girl has 2 brothers in the class,\" but it doesn't specify anything about the boys.\n\nSo, perhaps there are boys who are not brothers to any of the girls.\n\nBut that seems confusing.\n\nLet me consider that all boys in the class are brothers to some of the girls.\n\nIn that case, the total number of brother relationships is 30, as calculated earlier.\n\nIf each boy is counted S times, where S is the number of sisters he has, then the sum of S over all boys equals 30.\n\nBut without knowing how many sisters each boy has, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each boy has a certain number of sisters, and relate that to the total number of girls.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nB = number of boys in the class.\n\nEach boy has G sisters, where G is the number of girls in his family who are in the class.\n\nBut again, without knowing the family structure, this seems too vague.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the total number of brother relationships from the boys' perspective.\n\nEach boy has a certain number of sisters who are girls in the class.\n\nLet\u2019s say boy B has S_B sisters in the class.\n\nThen, the total number of brother relationships is the sum of S_B over all boys.\n\nWe know that this sum must equal 30, as calculated earlier.\n\nNow, if all boys have the same number of sisters, then S_B is the same for all boys, say S.\n\nThen, the total number of brother relationships would be B * S = 30.\n\nBut again, without knowing S, I can't solve for B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average number of sisters per boy is 15 / B, since there are 15 girls in total.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate, because not all girls are necessarily sisters to each boy.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the 2 brothers each girl has are distinct for each girl.\n\nBut that would mean that each girl has her own 2 brothers, not shared with other girls.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, that would lead to 15 * 2 = 30 brothers, which is more than the total number of students.\n\nSo, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some girls share brothers, reducing the total number of boys.\n\nFor example, if two girls share both brothers, then those brothers are counted for both girls.\n\nIn that case, the total number of distinct brothers would be less than 30.\n\nBut without knowing how many girls share brothers, it's hard to determine the exact number.\n\nThis seems too ambiguous.\n\nLet me try to think about it in terms of pairs.\n\nEach brother relationship connects a girl and a boy who are siblings.\n\nSo, each such pair represents a sibling relationship.\n\nGiven that each girl has 2 brothers, there are 15 girls * 2 = 30 such sibling pairs.\n\nNow, each boy is involved in S such pairs, where S is the number of sisters he has in the class.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sibling pairs is equal to the sum of S over all boys.\n\nAgain, this brings me back to the earlier impasse.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the average number of sisters per boy is 15 / B.\n\nThen, the total number of sibling pairs would be B * (15 / B) = 15, but that's not matching the 30 we have.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because each girl has 2 brothers, so the total number of sibling pairs should be 15 girls * 2 brothers = 30 pairs.\n\nBut according to this, B * (15 / B) = 15, which is half of 30.\n\nThat suggests that perhaps each boy has, on average, 15 / B sisters, and the total number of sibling pairs is B * (15 / B) = 15, but we know it should be 30.\n\nThis inconsistency indicates that my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each boy has S sisters, and the total number of sibling pairs is B * S = 30.\n\nBut also, the total number of sisters for all boys should relate to the total number of girls, which is 15.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's difficult to find a direct relationship.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the total number of sister relationships equals the total number of brother relationships.\n\nEach sister relationship connects a girl and a boy who are siblings.\n\nSo, the total number of sister relationships is also 30, since each of the 15 girls has 2 brothers.\n\nWait, but sister relationships are the same as brother relationships; they are just viewed from different perspectives.\n\nSo, the total number of such relationships is 30.\n\nNow, from the boys' perspective, each boy has a certain number of sisters, and the sum of these numbers over all boys should equal 30.\n\nLet\u2019s denote B as the number of boys.\n\nIf each boy has S sisters, then B * S = 30.\n\nBut I don't know S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another equation involving B.\n\nI know that the total number of students is 25, and the number of girls is 15, so the number of boys is 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward.\n\nIf there are 25 students and 15 are girls, then the number of boys is 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nBut earlier, I was confused because I was trying to account for the brother relationships.\n\nNow, perhaps the number of boys is simply 10, and the brother relationships are distributed among them.\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 10 boys, and each girl has 2 brothers among them, then the total number of brother relationships is 15 * 2 = 30.\n\nIf there are 10 boys, and the total number of brother relationships is 30, then on average, each boy is a brother to 30 / 10 = 3 girls.\n\nBut in reality, the number of sisters each boy has could vary.\n\nHowever, the average works out.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of boys is indeed 10.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that if each girl has 2 distinct brothers, that would require at least 30 brothers, which is not possible with only 10 boys.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the brothers are shared among the girls.\n\nSo, with 10 boys, and each boy being a brother to an average of 3 girls, the total number of brother relationships is 10 * 3 = 30, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys in the class is 10.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if there are 10 boys, and each girl has 2 brothers, then the total number of brother relationships is 15 * 2 = 30, and with 10 boys, each boy is, on average, a brother to 3 girls.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nBut is there a way to confirm this?\n\nLet\u2019s consider a smaller example to verify the logic.\n\nSuppose there are 5 girls and 2 boys in a class, and each girl has 2 brothers.\n\nThen, the total number of brother relationships would be 5 * 2 = 10.\n\nWith 2 boys, each boy would be a brother to 5 girls, which is possible if both boys are brothers to all 5 girls.\n\nBut in that case, each girl would have 2 brothers, which matches the condition.\n\nNow, scaling this up to the original problem:\n\n15 girls, each with 2 brothers, total brother relationships = 30.\n\nIf there are 10 boys, each boy is a brother to 3 girls.\n\nThis seems consistent, as 10 boys * 3 girls per boy = 30 brother relationships.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys in the class is 10.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that \"each girl has 2 brothers in the class.\"\n\nDoes this imply that each girl has exactly 2 brothers in the class, or at least 2 brothers in the class?\n\nIf it's exactly 2, then the previous calculation holds.\n\nHowever, if it's at least 2, there could be more boys who are not brothers to any girl.\n\nBut given the wording, \"each girl has 2 brothers in the class,\" it seems to suggest that each girl has exactly 2 brothers in the class.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys is 10.\n\nBut let's consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose there are families where each family has some girls and some boys, and all siblings are in the class.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that all the girls and boys in the class are from the same family.\n\nIn that case, if there are 15 girls and 10 boys, then each girl has 10 brothers, which is more than 2.\n\nThat contradicts the condition that each girl has exactly 2 brothers in the class.\n\nTherefore, not all students can be from the same family.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple families, and each girl has 2 brothers from her own family.\n\nIn that case, each girl has 2 brothers, and these brothers are only counted within their own family.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify anything about families, so perhaps this is an unnecessary complication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some boys are brothers to some girls, while others are not brothers to any girls.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, given the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some boys are brothers to multiple girls, while others are brothers to fewer.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the simplest approach is to accept that with 15 girls and each having 2 brothers, leading to 30 brother relationships, and with 10 boys, each being a brother to 3 girls, the numbers work out.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys in the class is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
