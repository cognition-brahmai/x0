        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a city with a population divided into three groups based on eye color: brown, blue, and green. The percentages are 60% brown, 30% blue, and 10% green. Then, we're told that 80% of the brown-eyed people wear glasses, and 50% of the blue-eyed people wear glasses. The question is, what percentage of the green-eyed people must wear glasses if exactly 70% of the entire population wears glasses?\n\nFirst, I think it would help to assume a specific population number to make the calculations clearer. Let's assume the total population is 1000 people. This makes the math easier because percentages will directly translate into numbers of people.\n\nSo, with a population of 1000:\n\n- Brown-eyed people: 60% of 1000 = 600 people\n\n- Blue-eyed people: 30% of 1000 = 300 people\n\n- Green-eyed people: 10% of 1000 = 100 people\n\nNext, we're told that 80% of the brown-eyed people wear glasses. So, the number of brown-eyed people who wear glasses is:\n\n80% of 600 = 0.8 * 600 = 480 people\n\nSimilarly, 50% of the blue-eyed people wear glasses:\n\n50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150 people\n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of the green-eyed people must wear glasses so that the total percentage of the population wearing glasses is exactly 70%.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many people in total are supposed to wear glasses. Since it's 70% of the population:\n\n70% of 1000 = 0.7 * 1000 = 700 people\n\nWe already have 480 (brown-eyed) + 150 (blue-eyed) = 630 people wearing glasses from the brown and blue-eyed groups.\n\nSo, the number of green-eyed people who need to wear glasses to reach the total of 700 is:\n\n700 (total wearing glasses) - 630 (brown and blue-eyed wearing glasses) = 70 people\n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage 70 is of the green-eyed population, which is 100 people.\n\nPercentage = (number wearing glasses / total green-eyed people) * 100\n\nPercentage = (70 / 100) * 100 = 70%\n\nSo, 70% of the green-eyed people must wear glasses for the overall population to have exactly 70% wearing glasses.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the total number of people wearing glasses:\n\nBrown: 480\n\nBlue: 150\n\nGreen: 70\n\nTotal: 480 + 150 + 70 = 700, which matches the required 70% of 1000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, like using proportions or equations.\n\nLet\u2019s try setting up an equation to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let x be the percentage of green-eyed people who wear glasses.\n\nGiven:\n\n- 80% of 600 (brown-eyed) wear glasses: 0.8 * 600 = 480\n\n- 50% of 300 (blue-eyed) wear glasses: 0.5 * 300 = 150\n\n- x% of 100 (green-eyed) wear glasses: (x/100) * 100 = x\n\nTotal wearing glasses: 480 + 150 + x = 700 (since 70% of 1000 is 700)\n\nSo, 480 + 150 + x = 700\n\n630 + x = 700\n\nx = 700 - 630 = 70\n\nSo, x = 70, meaning 70% of the green-eyed people must wear glasses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can solve this without assuming a specific population size, using proportions.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total population as P.\n\nThen:\n\n- Brown-eyed: 0.6P\n\n- Blue-eyed: 0.3P\n\n- Green-eyed: 0.1P\n\nNumber wearing glasses:\n\n- Brown: 0.8 * 0.6P = 0.48P\n\n- Blue: 0.5 * 0.3P = 0.15P\n\n- Green: x * 0.1P\n\nTotal wearing glasses: 0.48P + 0.15P + x*0.1P = 0.7P (since 70% wear glasses)\n\nSo, 0.48P + 0.15P + 0.1xP = 0.7P\n\nCombine like terms: 0.63P + 0.1xP = 0.7P\n\nSubtract 0.63P from both sides: 0.1xP = 0.07P\n\nDivide both sides by P (assuming P \u2260 0): 0.1x = 0.07\n\nThen, x = 0.07 / 0.1 = 0.7, which is 70%\n\nSo, again, we arrive at 70%.\n\nWait, but is there any other way to interpret this? Maybe I should consider if there's a possibility of overlapping categories or something, but the problem seems straightforward: different eye colors with no overlap, and percentages of each group wearing glasses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me by giving percentages that might not add up in an intuitive way, but in this case, everything seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. The problem states \"exactly 70% of the entire population wears glasses.\" And we're to find the percentage of green-eyed people who must wear glasses to meet this condition.\n\nGiven that we've calculated it two different ways and both point to 70%, I think that's the answer.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, let's consider if the percentages could be different if we considered different population sizes. But since proportions should hold regardless of population size, as long as the percentages remain the same, the result should be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this using weighted averages or something, but I think the approach I've taken is sufficient and accurate.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 70% of the green-eyed people must wear glasses for the overall population to have exactly 70% wearing glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70\\%} \\]"
