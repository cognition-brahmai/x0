        "content": "A horseshoe is a U-shaped piece of metal that is attached to a horse's hoof to protect it from wear and tear. Horses that are worked on hard surfaces, such as roads or paved areas, are particularly prone to hoof damage, and horseshoes help to prevent this. In addition to protecting the hoof, horseshoes can also improve a horse's gait and provide traction on slippery surfaces. Some horseshoes are also designed to correct specific issues with a horse's hoof or leg alignment."
