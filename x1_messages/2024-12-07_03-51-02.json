        "content": "Sure! Here's a TypeScript class representing a \"Vehicle\" with the specified properties and methods:\n\n```typescript\nclass Vehicle {\n    make: string;\n    model: string;\n    year: number;\n    mileage: number;\n\n    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, mileage: number) {\n        this.make = make;\n        this.model = model;\n        this.year = year;\n        this.mileage = mileage;\n    }\n\n    updateMileage(newMileage: number): void {\n        if (newMileage >= this.mileage) {\n            this.mileage = newMileage;\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"New mileage cannot be less than the current mileage.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): void {\n        console.log(`Make: ${this.make}`);\n        console.log(`Model: ${this.model}`);\n        console.log(`Year: ${this.year}`);\n        console.log(`Mileage: ${this.mileage} miles`);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst myCar = new Vehicle(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020, 30000);\nmyCar.displayInfo();\nmyCar.updateMileage(35000);\nmyCar.displayInfo();\nmyCar.updateMileage(25000); // This should log an error message\n```\n\nIn this class:\n\n- The constructor initializes the make, model, year, and mileage of the vehicle.\n\n- The `updateMileage` method allows updating the mileage, but only if the new mileage is greater than or equal to the current mileage. This prevents mileage rollback.\n\n- The `displayInfo` method prints out the vehicle's information to the console.\n\nYou can create an instance of the `Vehicle` class and use its methods as shown in the example usage."
