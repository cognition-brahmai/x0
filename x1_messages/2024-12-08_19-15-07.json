        "content": "Let's see. There's this snail climbing a 15-foot wall. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slides down 2 feet. I need to find out on which day it finally reaches the top.\n\nFirst, I should understand the net progress the snail makes each day. During the day, it climbs 3 feet, but at night, it slides back 2 feet. So, the net gain each day is 3 - 2 = 1 foot.\n\nNow, if the snail gains 1 foot each day, it might seem like it would take 15 days to reach the top. But wait, that might not account for the last day when it reaches the top.\n\nLet me think differently. Each day, the snail effectively moves up by 1 foot. But on the last day, when it reaches or surpasses the top, it won't slide back that night because it has already reached the top.\n\nSo, I need to consider that on the final day, the snail climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nLet me calculate how much distance the snail covers before the final day. Suppose it reaches a certain height just before the final climb. On the final day, it climbs 3 feet and doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, if the wall is 15 feet high, and on the final day it climbs 3 feet, then before that, it must have been at 15 - 3 = 12 feet.\n\nWait, is that right? If the snail is at 12 feet at the start of the final day, it climbs 3 feet to reach 15 feet and doesn't slide back. That seems correct.\n\nNow, how many days does it take for the snail to reach 12 feet, given that it makes a net progress of 1 foot per day?\n\nIf it needs to reach 12 feet with a net gain of 1 foot per day, that would take 12 days.\n\nThen, on the 13th day, it climbs the remaining 3 feet to reach the top.\n\nTherefore, the snail reaches the top on the 13th day.\n\nBut let me double-check. Over 12 days, the snail climbs 1 foot per day, so 12 feet in 12 days. On the 13th day, it climbs 3 feet to reach 15 feet.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that on each day, it makes a net gain of 1 foot, except for the last day, where it climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nSo, overall, it takes 13 days for the snail to reach the top of the 15-foot wall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]\n"
