        "content": "So the problem here is about a group of friends planning a road trip. They've got a car that can travel 300 miles on one tank of gas, and there are four friends, each agreeing to pay for one full tank of gas. The question is, how far can they travel in total?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems straightforward: if the car can go 300 miles on one tank, and there are four tanks being paid for, then the total distance they can travel should be 300 miles multiplied by 4, right? So, 300 times 4 is 1200 miles. That sounds simple enough.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this a bit more. Is there any other factor that might affect the total distance they can travel? For example, do they need to consider the return trip? The problem doesn't specify if this is a one-way trip or a round trip. If it's a round trip, then they would need to divide the total distance by two to find out how far they can go before turning back.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't mention anything about returning, so perhaps it's a one-way trip. In that case, 1200 miles is the total distance they can travel.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the car can hold more than one tank of gas at a time. But typically, cars have only one gas tank, so that's probably not relevant here.\n\nAlso, are there any stops along the way where they might need to refuel? The problem says each friend pays for one full tank, but it doesn't specify when or where the refueling occurs. Maybe they plan to refuel at certain points during the trip.\n\nBut, given the information provided, it seems like they have four full tanks paid for, and the car can travel 300 miles per tank. So, unless there are additional constraints, the total distance should be 1200 miles.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the problem is worded. It says \"each friend has agreed to pay for one full tank of gas.\" Does this mean that each friend is contributing enough money to fill the tank once, or is there something else here?\n\nWait a minute, maybe the friends are collectively paying for the gas, and each one is paying for a portion of the total gas needed. But no, it says each friend pays for one full tank. So, if there are four friends, and each pays for one full tank, that should be four tanks in total.\n\nUnless, perhaps, they're planning to make multiple stops and each one is paying for a tank at different points during the trip. But again, the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friends are sharing the driving, and each one drives a segment corresponding to one tank. But that seems unnecessary for calculating the total distance.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key points are:\n\n- The car can travel 300 miles per tank.\n\n- There are four friends, each paying for one full tank.\n\nAssuming that the four tanks are available for the entire trip, the total distance should be 300 miles multiplied by 4, which is 1200 miles.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the friends are paying for the gas in advance, and they have four full tanks' worth of gas to use during the trip. In that case, again, 1200 miles.\n\nI can't think of any other factors that would change this calculation based on the information provided. Therefore, the best answer is that they can travel 1200 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
