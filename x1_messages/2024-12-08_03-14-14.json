Greece is renowned for its rich history, influential culture, and stunning landscapes, including its thousands of islands in the Aegean and Ionian seas. The Isthmus of Corinth is a narrow piece of land that links the Peloponnese to the rest of Greece, and it has been of great strategic importance throughout history."
