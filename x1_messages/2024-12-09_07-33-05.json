        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 40 students. 70% passed their math exam, and 80% passed their science exam. Also, every student passed at least one of the exams. We need to find the minimum number of students who passed both exams.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many students passed each exam.\n\nFor math:\n\n70% of 40 students passed math.\n\nSo, number of students who passed math = 70/100 * 40 = 28 students.\n\nFor science:\n\n80% of 40 students passed science.\n\nSo, number of students who passed science = 80/100 * 40 = 32 students.\n\nNow, since every student passed at least one exam, the total number of students who passed either math or science or both should be equal to the total number of students, which is 40.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that:\n\nNumber of students who passed math or science = Number who passed math + Number who passed science - Number who passed both.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nM = number of students who passed math = 28\n\nS = number of students who passed science = 32\n\nB = number of students who passed both = ?\n\nTotal students = 40.\n\nSo, according to inclusion-exclusion:\n\nM + S - B = Total students\n\n28 + 32 - B = 40\n\n60 - B = 40\n\nB = 60 - 40\n\nB = 20.\n\nSo, according to this, 20 students passed both exams.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimum number of students who passed both exams.\n\nIs it possible to have fewer than 20 students passing both exams?\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nIf we have 28 students passing math and 32 passing science, the total number of passes is 28 + 32 = 60.\n\nBut there are only 40 students, so some students must have passed both exams.\n\nThe overlap, or the number of students who passed both, is 60 - 40 = 20, as we calculated.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the minimum number of students who passed both exams is 20.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way to minimize this further.\n\nSuppose we try to minimize the number of students who passed both exams.\n\nTo minimize B, we need to maximize the number of students who passed only one exam.\n\nGiven that M = 28 and S = 32, the maximum number of students who passed only math is M - B, and only science is S - B.\n\nThe total number of students is:\n\nOnly math + Only science + Both = (M - B) + (S - B) + B = M + S - B.\n\nWe know M + S - B = 40.\n\nSo, B = M + S - 40 = 28 + 32 - 40 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of students who passed both exams is 20.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in terms of sets.\n\nLet A be the set of students who passed math, and B be the set of students who passed science.\n\nWe know that |A| = 28, |B| = 32, and |A \u222a B| = 40.\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B|.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nSo, 40 = 28 + 32 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nThus, |A \u2229 B| = 28 + 32 - 40 = 20.\n\nAgain, we get 20.\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who passed both exams is 20.\n\nI don't see a way to have fewer than 20 students passing both exams given the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
