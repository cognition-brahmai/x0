        "content": "So I've got this triangle with sides measuring 5 cm, 12 cm, and 13 cm, and I need to find its area. Hmm, I remember that there are different ways to find the area of a triangle, like using base and height, or maybe Heron's formula. But I'm not sure which one to use here.\n\nFirst, I should check if this is a right-angled triangle because that might make things easier. I know that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the longest side should equal the sum of the squares of the other two sides, according to the Pythagorean theorem. Let me see: 5 squared is 25, 12 squared is 144, and 13 squared is 169. Now, 25 plus 144 is 169, which matches 13 squared. So, yes, this is a right-angled triangle with the right angle between the sides of 5 cm and 12 cm.\n\nSince it's a right-angled triangle, I can use the formula for the area of a right-angled triangle, which is one-half times the base times the height. Here, the base and height are the two sides that form the right angle, so that's 5 cm and 12 cm.\n\nSo, area = (1/2) * 5 cm * 12 cm = (1/2) * 60 cm\u00b2 = 30 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to confirm this? Maybe using Heron's formula? Heron's formula says that the area of a triangle is equal to the square root of s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c), where s is half of the perimeter, and a, b, c are the lengths of the sides.\n\nLet me calculate s first. The perimeter is 5 cm + 12 cm + 13 cm = 30 cm, so s = 30 cm / 2 = 15 cm.\n\nNow, plug into Heron's formula:\n\nArea = \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = \u221a[15(15 - 5)(15 - 12)(15 - 13)] = \u221a[15 * 10 * 3 * 2] = \u221a[15 * 10 * 3 * 2] = \u221a[450 * 2] = \u221a900 = 30 cm\u00b2.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the area is indeed 30 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can use trigonometry here. Since it's a right-angled triangle, I know the angles are 90 degrees, and then the other two angles can be found using trigonometric ratios.\n\nFor example, the sine of one angle is opposite over hypotenuse. But I'm not sure if that's necessary since I already have two methods giving me the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula that involves the determinant of coordinates if I place the triangle in a coordinate plane, but that seems more complicated for this straightforward problem.\n\nI think I'm confident with the answer of 30 cm\u00b2. It makes sense, and it's consistent across different methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
