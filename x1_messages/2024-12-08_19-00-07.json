        "content": "So I've got this right triangle problem here. One leg is 5 inches, and the hypotenuse is 13 inches. I need to find the length of the other leg. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that in a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem holds. That's a fundamental rule here. The theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two legs. So, if we have legs a and b, and hypotenuse c, it's a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2.\n\nIn this problem, one leg is 5 inches, so let's call that a = 5 inches. The hypotenuse is 13 inches, so c = 13 inches. I need to find the length of the other leg, which is b.\n\nSo, plugging into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n5\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\n\nLet me calculate the squares:\n\n25 + b\u00b2 = 169\n\nNow, I need to solve for b\u00b2. I'll subtract 25 from both sides:\n\nb\u00b2 = 169 - 25\n\nb\u00b2 = 144\n\nAlright, so b\u00b2 is 144. To find b, I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = \u221a144\n\nb = 12 inches\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 inches.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe I can check if these sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nLet's see:\n\n5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 25 + 144 = 169, which is equal to 13\u00b2. Yep, that checks out.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using trigonometric ratios, but that might be overkill for a straightforward Pythagorean theorem problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether this is a Pythagorean triple. I know that 5-12-13 is a well-known Pythagorean triple. So, it makes sense that the sides are in that ratio.\n\nJust to recall, Pythagorean triples are sets of integers that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. Some common ones are 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17, and so on. So, recognizing this could have immediately told me that the other leg is 12 inches.\n\nBut it's always good to verify using the theorem itself to ensure accuracy.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider here? The problem seems straightforward, and I've arrived at the answer using a reliable method. I don't think there are any tricks or additional steps needed.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be another solution. For example, could there be a different triangle with these measurements but a different length for the other leg? In a right triangle, the sides are strictly related by the Pythagorean theorem, so there's only one possible length for the other leg given the hypotenuse and one leg.\n\nTherefore, the other leg must be 12 inches.\n\nAlright, I think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
