        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students, and there are twice as many girls as boys. That means if we let the number of boys be B, then the number of girls would be 2B. And since the total number of students is 30, we can write the equation:\n\nB + 2B = 30\n\nThat simplifies to 3B = 30, so B = 10. That means there are 10 boys and 20 girls in the class.\n\nNext, we're told that 60% of the girls passed the exam. So, 60% of 20 girls is:\n\n0.60 * 20 = 12 girls passed.\n\nSimilarly, 50% of the boys passed the exam. So, 50% of 10 boys is:\n\n0.50 * 10 = 5 boys passed.\n\nTo find the total number of students who passed, we just add the number of girls who passed to the number of boys who passed:\n\n12 + 5 = 17.\n\nSo, 17 students in total passed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
