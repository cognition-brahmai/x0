        "content": "Sure! Reversing a singly linked list is a classic problem in computer science, and it's a great exercise to understand how pointers work in linked data structures. I'll walk you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a singly linked list is. A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node contains some data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to `None`, indicating the end of the list.\n\nOur goal is to reverse this list, meaning that the original first node should become the last node, and the original last node should become the first node, with all the pointers adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n\nTo reverse a singly linked list, we can use an iterative approach where we keep track of three pointers:\n\n1. **Previous** (`prev`): Initially set to `None`. This will hold the reversed part of the list.\n2. **Current** (`current`): Starts at the head of the list. This will be the node we're processing.\n3. **Next** (`next`): This will hold the next node in the original list so we don't lose reference to it.\n\nWe iterate through the list, updating the pointers as follows:\n\n- Set `next` to `current.next`.\n- Set `current.next` to `prev`, reversing the pointer.\n- Move `prev` to `current`.\n- Move `current` to `next`.\n\nWe repeat this process until `current` becomes `None`, which means we've reached the end of the original list. At this point, `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head):\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current:\n        next = current.next\n        current.next = prev\n        prev = current\n        current = next\n    return prev\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `prev` is initialized to `None` because initially, there are no nodes before the head in the reversed list.\n   - `current` starts at the head of the list.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - We loop through the list while `current` is not `None`.\n   - Inside the loop:\n     - `next = current.next`: Save the next node before modifying the pointer.\n     - `current.next = prev`: Reverse the pointer to the previous node.\n     - `prev = current`: Move `prev` to the current node.\n     - `current = next`: Move `current` to the next node in the original list.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - After the loop, `prev` will be the new head of the reversed list, so we return it.\n\nThis approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list, since we're visiting each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(1), as we're only using a constant amount of additional space for the pointers."
