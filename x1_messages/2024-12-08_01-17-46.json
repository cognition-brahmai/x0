        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students, and out of those, 18 have brown eyes and 12 have blue eyes. The question is, what percentage of the class has brown eyes? Hmm, percentages can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a percentage is. A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. So, if I say X percent, it means X per 100. It's a way to standardize numbers so they can be easily compared.\n\nIn this case, I want to find out what percentage of the class has brown eyes. The total number of students is 30, and the number with brown eyes is 18. So, I need to find out what part 18 is of 30, and then express that part as a percentage.\n\nOne way to do this is to set up a fraction where the number of students with brown eyes is over the total number of students. So, that would be 18/30. This fraction represents the part of the class that has brown eyes.\n\nNow, to convert this fraction to a percentage, I can divide the numerator by the denominator and then multiply by 100. So, 18 divided by 30, and then multiplied by 100.\n\nLet me do the division first. 18 divided by 30. Well, 30 goes into 18 zero times, so I can add a decimal and make it 180 divided by 30, which is 6. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again.\n\nActually, 30 goes into 18 zero times, so I can write 0. and then 180 (by adding a decimal and a zero). 30 goes into 180 six times exactly. So, 18 divided by 30 is 0.6.\n\nNow, to convert 0.6 to a percentage, I multiply by 100. So, 0.6 times 100 is 60%.\n\nTherefore, 60% of the class has brown eyes.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If there are 30 students and 18 have brown eyes, then the fraction is 18/30, which simplifies to 3/5, since both numerator and denominator can be divided by 6.\n\nNow, 3/5 is equal to 0.6, and 0.6 times 100 is indeed 60%. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that if the whole class is 100%, and there are 30 students, then each student represents approximately 3.33% of the class (since 100% divided by 30 is about 3.33%).\n\nSo, if each student is about 3.33%, then 18 students would be 18 times 3.33%, which is approximately 59.94%, which rounds up to 60%. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion. If 30 students are 100%, then 18 students are what percentage? So, I can set up the equation:\n\n30 / 100 = 18 / x\n\nWait, actually, that might be a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\n18 is to 30 as x is to 100.\n\nSo, 18/30 = x/100.\n\nThen, to solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 18 * 100 = 30 * x.\n\nSo, 1800 = 30x.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 30: x = 1800 / 30 = 60.\n\nAgain, that gives me x = 60, which means 60%.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 60%. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check the addition of brown and blue-eyed students. There are 18 with brown eyes and 12 with blue eyes, which adds up to 30, so that matches the total number of students. If I were to find the percentage of blue-eyed students, it should be 100% minus 60%, which is 40%.\n\nLet me verify that. 12 out of 30 students have blue eyes. Using the same method: 12 divided by 30 is 0.4, and 0.4 times 100 is 40%. So, yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to see that half of 30 is 15, so if 18 is 15 plus 3, which is 15 (which would be 50%) plus an additional 3 students. Each student is about 3.33%, so 3 students would be about 10%, making it 50% plus 10%, which is 60%.\n\nWait, that's an interesting way to think about it too. It's like saying 15 out of 30 is 50%, and the extra 3 out of 30 is approximately 10%, so total is 60%.\n\nAll these different approaches lead me to the same conclusion, which reinforces that 60% is the correct answer.\n\nSo, to sum it up, 60% of the class has brown eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
