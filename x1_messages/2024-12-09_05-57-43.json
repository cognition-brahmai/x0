        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a new public park. The park is 50 acres big, and they've got a budget of $2 million to build it. They need to figure out the cost per acre for building the park, considering how the budget is split up among different things like landscaping, infrastructure, and recreational facilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"cost per acre\" means. I think it's the total cost divided by the total area, which would give us the cost to develop each acre of the park. But, in this case, there are different components to the budget, so maybe I need to consider how each part contributes to the overall cost per acre.\n\nThe budget is divided into three parts:\n\n1. Landscaping: 60% of the total budget\n\n2. Infrastructure: 30% of the total budget\n\n3. Recreational facilities: 10% of the total budget\n\nSo, let's calculate how much money is allocated to each category.\n\nTotal budget: $2,000,000\n\nLandscaping: 60% of $2,000,000 = 0.60 * 2,000,000 = $1,200,000\n\nInfrastructure: 30% of $2,000,000 = 0.30 * 2,000,000 = $600,000\n\nRecreational facilities: 10% of $2,000,000 = 0.10 * 2,000,000 = $200,000\n\nNow, the total area of the park is 50 acres. To find the cost per acre, I need to see how much it costs to develop one acre, considering all these components.\n\nI think the simplest way is to divide the total budget by the total area.\n\nTotal cost per acre = Total budget / Total area = $2,000,000 / 50 acres = $40,000 per acre\n\nBut, the problem mentions that different percentages of the budget are allocated to different things. Maybe I need to calculate the cost per acre for each component separately and then sum them up to get the total cost per acre.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, landscaping: $1,200,000 for 50 acres\n\nCost per acre for landscaping = $1,200,000 / 50 = $24,000 per acre\n\nNext, infrastructure: $600,000 for 50 acres\n\nCost per acre for infrastructure = $600,000 / 50 = $12,000 per acre\n\nThen, recreational facilities: $200,000 for 50 acres\n\nCost per acre for recreational facilities = $200,000 / 50 = $4,000 per acre\n\nNow, if I add these up:\n\nTotal cost per acre = landscaping cost per acre + infrastructure cost per acre + recreational facilities cost per acre\n\nTotal cost per acre = $24,000 + $12,000 + $4,000 = $40,000 per acre\n\nWait, that's the same as when I just divided the total budget by the total area. So, in this case, it seems like both methods give the same result.\n\nBut maybe there's a different way to approach this, or perhaps there's something else I need to consider.\n\nLet me think about whether all parts of the budget are spread evenly across the entire area. For example, landscaping might be distributed uniformly across all acres, but infrastructure like restrooms and parking lots might be concentrated in specific areas, potentially affecting the cost per acre differently.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, it seems that the budget percentages are applied to the overall park development, and the areas aren't specified for each component. So, assuming that the costs are evenly distributed across the entire area, the method I used should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if some parts of the park require more development than others, the cost per acre might vary, but since we don't have that level of detail, it's reasonable to assume an even distribution.\n\nTherefore, the cost per acre for building the park is $40,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal budget: $2,000,000\n\nTotal area: 50 acres\n\nTotal cost per acre: $2,000,000 / 50 = $40,000 per acre\n\nNow, verifying with the component costs:\n\nLandscaping: $1,200,000 / 50 = $24,000 per acre\n\nInfrastructure: $600,000 / 50 = $12,000 per acre\n\nRecreational facilities: $200,000 / 50 = $4,000 per acre\n\nSum: $24,000 + $12,000 + $4,000 = $40,000 per acre\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nSo, the cost per acre for building the park is $40,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40000} \\]"
