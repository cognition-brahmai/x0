        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the car travels at 50 miles per hour for 6 hours. To find out how far it goes in that time, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance1 = 50 mph \u00d7 6 hours = 300 miles\n\nThen, the car increases its speed to 60 miles per hour and travels for another 4 hours. Again, using the same formula:\n\nDistance2 = 60 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, we just add the two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 300 miles + 240 miles = 540 miles\n\nSo, the car has traveled a total of 540 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{540} \\]"
