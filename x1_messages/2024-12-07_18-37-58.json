Alice brings her favorite book to school and places it on the table near the window. While Alice goes to the restroom, Mr. Smith moves the book to his desk because he thinks it's distracting. Later, Bob sees the book on Mr. Smith's desk and decides to borrow it for lunchtime reading. He takes the book and puts it in his backpack. When Alice returns from the restroom, she doesn't know that her book has been moved twice. Where does Alice think her book is?"
