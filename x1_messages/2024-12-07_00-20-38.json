        "content": "So here's this problem about two trains and a bird. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. Train A is leaving Station A heading towards Station B at 60 mph, and Station B is 180 miles away. At the same time, Train B is leaving Station B heading towards Station A at 40 mph. So, they're moving towards each other. And there's a bird that starts flying from Station A at 100 mph when the trains start moving, flying back and forth between the two trains until they collide. The question is, how far will the bird have traveled by the time the trains collide?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to figure out when and where the trains will collide. Maybe I can find the time it takes for the two trains to meet, and then calculate how far the bird would have flown in that time.\n\nLet's see, Train A is going at 60 mph and Train B at 40 mph towards each other, so their combined speed is 60 + 40 = 100 mph. They're starting 180 miles apart, so the time it takes for them to meet should be distance divided by their combined speed, right? So, time = 180 miles / 100 mph = 1.8 hours.\n\nNow, the bird is flying back and forth between the trains at 100 mph starting from Station A at the same time the trains start moving. So, for the entire time until the trains collide, the bird is continuously flying at 100 mph.\n\nTherefore, the distance the bird travels is its speed multiplied by the time it's flying. So, distance = 100 mph * 1.8 hours = 180 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems almost straightforward. But I recall that sometimes with problems involving back-and-forth motion, like the bird flying between the trains, people try to calculate the infinite series of distances the bird travels each time it goes from one train to the other. But that seems unnecessarily complicated if I can just calculate the total time and multiply by the bird's speed.\n\nLet me double-check. The trains are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 100 mph from 180 miles apart, so they'll meet in 1.8 hours. The bird is flying continuously at 100 mph during this time, so 100 mph * 1.8 hours = 180 miles. That should be the total distance the bird travels before the trains collide.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. Sometimes problems like these try to trick you into thinking it's more complicated than it is, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
