        "content": "To calculate the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1\\), we'll use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if \\(f(x) = x^n\\), then \\(f'(x) = n \\cdot x^{n-1}\\), where \\(n\\) is a constant.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the function:\n\n1. For the first term, \\(x^3\\):\n\n   - Here, \\(n = 3\\).\n\n   - Applying the power rule: \\(3 \\cdot x^{3-1} = 3x^2\\).\n\n2. For the second term, \\(-6x^2\\):\n\n   - This term has a coefficient, \\(-6\\), and the variable \\(x\\) raised to the power of 2.\n\n   - First, apply the power rule to \\(x^2\\): \\(2 \\cdot x^{2-1} = 2x\\).\n\n   - Then, multiply by the coefficient: \\(-6 \\cdot 2x = -12x\\).\n\n   - So, the derivative of \\(-6x^2\\) is \\(-12x\\).\n\n3. For the third term, \\(9x\\):\n\n   - Here, \\(n = 1\\) because \\(x\\) is the same as \\(x^1\\).\n\n   - Applying the power rule: \\(1 \\cdot x^{1-1} = 1 \\cdot x^0 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\).\n\n   - Then, multiply by the coefficient: \\(9 \\cdot 1 = 9\\).\n\n   - So, the derivative of \\(9x\\) is \\(9\\).\n\n4. For the constant term, \\(1\\):\n\n   - The derivative of a constant is always \\(0\\).\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of all the terms to get the derivative of the entire function:\n\n\\[f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\\]\n\nSo, the derivative of \\(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1\\) is \\(f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\\)."
