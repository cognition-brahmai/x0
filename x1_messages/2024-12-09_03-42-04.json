        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company that produces widgets. They have a fixed cost of $10,000 per month and a variable cost of $5 per widget. They sell each widget for $20, and I need to figure out how many widgets they need to sell to break even. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"break even\" means. Breaking even means that the total revenue from selling the widgets is equal to the total cost of producing them. So, there's no profit and no loss at that point.\n\nNow, the total cost consists of fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are costs that don't change with the number of widgets produced, like rent or salaries. In this case, it's $10,000 per month. Variable costs change with the number of widgets produced; here, it's $5 per widget.\n\nThe revenue is the income from selling the widgets, which is the selling price per widget times the number of widgets sold.\n\nSo, to break even, total revenue equals total cost.\n\nLet me denote the number of widgets needed to break even as \\( q \\).\n\nTherefore, the equation for breaking even is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} = \\text{Total Cost} \\]\n\n\\[ 20q = 10,000 + 5q \\]\n\nOkay, now I need to solve for \\( q \\).\n\nFirst, I'll subtract \\( 5q \\) from both sides to get:\n\n\\[ 20q - 5q = 10,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 15q = 10,000 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 15:\n\n\\[ q = \\frac{10,000}{15} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ q = 666.\\overline{6} \\]\n\nSince you can't sell a fraction of a widget, the company needs to sell at least 667 widgets to break even.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that.\n\nIf they sell 666 widgets:\n\nRevenue: \\( 666 \\times 20 = 13,320 \\)\n\nTotal Cost: \\( 10,000 + (666 \\times 5) = 10,000 + 3,330 = 13,330 \\)\n\nSo, revenue is $13,320 and cost is $13,330, which means they're still losing $10.\n\nIf they sell 667 widgets:\n\nRevenue: \\( 667 \\times 20 = 13,340 \\)\n\nTotal Cost: \\( 10,000 + (667 \\times 5) = 10,000 + 3,335 = 13,335 \\)\n\nNow, revenue is $13,340 and cost is $13,335, so they have a $5 profit.\n\nTherefore, to actually break even, they need to sell 667 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, if they sell 666.666... widgets, the break-even point is exactly at 666.\\overline{6} widgets, but since they can't sell a fraction, they need to sell 667 to cover the costs.\n\nSo, the answer is 667 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{667} \\]"
