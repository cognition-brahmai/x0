        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have five friends: Alice (A), Bob (B), Carol (C), Dave (D), and Eve (E). They need to stand in a line with some specific conditions:\n\n1. Alice is standing next to Bob, but not next to Carol.\n2. Dave is standing next to Carol, but not next to Eve.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these conditions mean for their positions in the line.\n\nStarting with condition 1: Alice is next to Bob, but not next to Carol.\n\nThis means that A and B must be adjacent, but A and C cannot be adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, condition 2 says that Dave is next to Carol, but not next to Eve. So, D and C must be adjacent, but D and E cannot be adjacent.\n\nAlright, so we have two pairs that must be adjacent: A and B, and C and D.\n\nBut there are restrictions: A cannot be next to C, and D cannot be next to E.\n\nLet me think about how to arrange these pairs.\n\nSince A and B are adjacent, and C and D are adjacent, but A cannot be next to C, and D cannot be next to E, I need to find arrangements where these pairs are separated in specific ways.\n\nMaybe it would help to treat the adjacent pairs as single units temporarily, and then see where they can be placed relative to each other.\n\nSo, let's consider AB as one unit and CD as another unit.\n\nBut AB cannot be next to C, and CD cannot be next to E.\n\nWait, AB cannot be next to C, but since AB is a unit, and C is part of the CD unit, so AB cannot be next to CD.\n\nSimilarly, CD cannot be next to E.\n\nSo, AB and CD cannot be adjacent, and CD cannot be adjacent to E.\n\nBut E is alone, not part of any pair.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe another approach: since AB and CD are both pairs that need to be together, perhaps I can think about the positions they can occupy in the line, keeping in mind the restrictions.\n\nLet's consider the positions in the line as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWe have to place AB together, which means they can be in positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.\n\nSimilarly, CD have to be together, so they can also be in positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.\n\nBut AB cannot be next to CD, and CD cannot be next to E.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider all possible ways to place AB and CD in the line, ensuring they are not next to each other.\n\nOnce those are placed, then place E in the remaining spot, making sure that CD is not next to E.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, find all possible placements for AB and CD such that they are not adjacent.\n\nThe total number of ways to place two adjacent pairs in a line of five positions, with the condition that the pairs are not next to each other.\n\nLet's list the possible positions for AB and CD.\n\nPossible positions for AB: positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5.\n\nSimilarly for CD.\n\nBut they cannot be adjacent.\n\nSo, if AB is in 1-2, CD cannot be in 2-3.\n\nIf AB is in 2-3, CD cannot be in 1-2 or 3-4.\n\nIf AB is in 3-4, CD cannot be in 2-3 or 4-5.\n\nIf AB is in 4-5, CD cannot be in 3-4.\n\nSo, for each position of AB, let's see where CD can be.\n\nCase 1: AB in 1-2.\n\nThen CD cannot be in 2-3.\n\nSo CD can be in 3-4 or 4-5.\n\nSubcase 1a: CD in 3-4.\n\nThen the positions are:\n\n1: A, 2: B, 3: C, 4: D, 5: E.\n\nBut wait, E is in position 5.\n\nBut we have to make sure that CD is not next to E.\n\nHere, CD is in 3-4, and E is in 5. So, CD is not next to E. Good.\n\nSubcase 1b: CD in 4-5.\n\nSo, positions:\n\n1: A, 2: B, 3: (open), 4: C, 5: D.\n\nThen E goes into position 3.\n\nSo, 1:A, 2:B, 3:E, 4:C, 5:D.\n\nHere, CD is in 4-5, and E is in 3, which is not adjacent to CD. Good.\n\nCase 2: AB in 2-3.\n\nThen CD cannot be in 1-2 or 3-4.\n\nSo CD can be in 4-5.\n\nSo, subcase 2a: CD in 4-5.\n\nPositions:\n\n1: (open), 2: A, 3: B, 4: C, 5: D.\n\nThen E goes into position 1.\n\nSo, 1:E, 2:A, 3:B, 4:C, 5:D.\n\nHere, CD is in 4-5, and E is in 1, not adjacent to CD. Good.\n\nCase 3: AB in 3-4.\n\nThen CD cannot be in 2-3 or 4-5.\n\nSo CD can be in 1-2.\n\nSubcase 3a: CD in 1-2.\n\nPositions:\n\n1: C, 2: D, 3: A, 4: B, 5: E.\n\nHere, CD is in 1-2, AB in 3-4, E in 5. CD is not next to E. Good.\n\nSubcase 3b: CD in 4-5 is not possible because AB is already in 3-4.\n\nWait, AB is in 3-4, and CD cannot be in 4-5. So only CD in 1-2 is possible.\n\nCase 4: AB in 4-5.\n\nThen CD cannot be in 3-4.\n\nSo CD can be in 1-2 or 2-3.\n\nSubcase 4a: CD in 1-2.\n\nPositions:\n\n1: C, 2: D, 3: (open), 4: A, 5: B.\n\nThen E goes into position 3.\n\nSo, 1:C, 2:D, 3:E, 4:A, 5:B.\n\nHere, CD is in 1-2, AB in 4-5, E in 3. CD is not next to E. Good.\n\nSubcase 4b: CD in 2-3.\n\nPositions:\n\n1: (open), 2: C, 3: D, 4: A, 5: B.\n\nThen E goes into position 1.\n\nSo, 1:E, 2:C, 3:D, 4:A, 5:B.\n\nHere, CD is in 2-3, AB in 4-5, E in 1. CD is not next to E. Good.\n\nSo, from the above, we have 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a, 4b. Total 6 subcases.\n\nNow, in each subcase, we have to consider the internal ordering of AB and CD.\n\nAB can be AB or BA.\n\nSimilarly, CD can be CD or DC.\n\nSo, for each subcase, there are 2 * 2 = 4 variations.\n\nTherefore, total arrangements so far: 6 subcases * 4 = 24.\n\nBut wait, we need to ensure that Alice is not next to Carol in any of these arrangements.\n\nWait, the condition is that Alice is not next to Carol, which is already satisfied because AB is a pair and not next to C, as per the earlier conditions.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that Alice is next to Bob, but not next to Carol.\n\nIn our earlier approach, we ensured that AB is not next to CD, which should imply that A is not next to C.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn subcase 1a: A B C D E\n\nHere, A is next to B, and C is next to D. A is not next to C. Good.\n\n1b: A B E C D\n\nA is next to B, C is next to D. A is not next to C. Good.\n\n2a: E A B C D\n\nA is next to B, C is next to D. A is not next to C. Good.\n\n3a: C D A B E\n\nA is next to B, C is next to D. A is not next to C. Good.\n\n4a: C D E A B\n\nA is next to B, C is next to D. A is not next to C. Good.\n\n4b: E C D A B\n\nA is next to B, C is next to D. A is not next to C. Good.\n\nSo, all subcases satisfy the condition that A is not next to C.\n\nSimilarly, in all these arrangements, CD is not next to E.\n\nIn subcase 1a: C D are in 3-4, E is in 5. Not adjacent.\n\n1b: C D are in 4-5, E is in 3. Not adjacent.\n\n2a: C D are in 4-5, E is in 1. Not adjacent.\n\n3a: C D are in 1-2, E is in 5. Not adjacent.\n\n4a: C D are in 1-2, E is in 3. Not adjacent.\n\n4b: C D are in 2-3, E is in 1. Not adjacent.\n\nSo, all arrangements satisfy both conditions.\n\nTherefore, total number of arrangements is 6 subcases * 4 (internal ordering) = 24.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are more subcases I haven't considered.\n\nLet me see: in case 3, only subcase 3a was considered, with CD in 1-2.\n\nBut what about CD in other positions?\n\nWait, in case 3, AB is in 3-4, so CD cannot be in 2-3 or 4-5.\n\nSo only CD in 1-2 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, in other cases, we've covered all possible positions for CD.\n\nSo, 6 subcases in total.\n\nTherefore, total arrangements are 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nBut let's think about it differently.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of AB and CD as single units, and arrange them along with E, considering the restrictions.\n\nSo, treat AB and CD as single units, and E as a single unit.\n\nThen, we have three units to arrange: AB, CD, and E.\n\nBut AB and CD cannot be adjacent, and CD cannot be adjacent to E.\n\nWait, actually, in the earlier approach, CD cannot be adjacent to E.\n\nBut if we treat AB and CD as single units, and arrange them with E, we need to ensure that CD is not adjacent to E.\n\nSo, first, arrange AB and CD, ensuring they are not adjacent.\n\nThen place E in the remaining spot, ensuring CD is not adjacent to E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to arrange AB and CD as units, with the restrictions, and then arrange the internal order.\n\nBut I think the earlier approach is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid arrangements is 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
