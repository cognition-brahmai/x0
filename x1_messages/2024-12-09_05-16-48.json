        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 10 blue marbles, 15 green marbles, and 20 red marbles. I need to find the probability that if I pick two marbles without replacing the first one, both of them will be red. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of marbles in the bag. Let's add them up:\n\n10 blue + 15 green + 20 red = 45 marbles in total.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. But since I'm picking two marbles without replacement, the probability will change after the first pick because the total number of marbles decreases by one.\n\nSo, for the first pick, the probability of drawing a red marble is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 20/45.\n\nIf the first marble is red, there are now 19 red marbles left and a total of 44 marbles remaining in the bag. So, the probability of picking another red marble is 19/44.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together (both marbles being red), I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the overall probability should be (20/45) * (19/44).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 20 divided by 45 is 20/45, which simplifies to 4/9.\n\nThen, 19 divided by 44 is 19/44.\n\nNow, multiply 4/9 by 19/44.\n\nMultiply numerator: 4 * 19 = 76\n\nMultiply denominator: 9 * 44 = 396\n\nSo, 76/396.\n\nNow, let's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth 76 and 396 are divisible by 4.\n\n76 \u00f7 4 = 19\n\n396 \u00f7 4 = 99\n\nSo, 19/99.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles picked are red is 19/99.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a better sense of it.\n\n19 divided by 99 is approximately 0.1919, or about 19.19%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 19.19% chance that both marbles picked will be red.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the total number of marbles: 10 blue + 15 green + 20 red = 45 total marbles. That's correct.\n\nProbability of first marble being red: 20/45 = 4/9. That's correct.\n\nAfter picking one red marble, there are now 19 red marbles left and 44 total marbles.\n\nProbability of second marble being red: 19/44. Correct.\n\nMultiplying them: (4/9) * (19/44) = 76/396.\n\nSimplifying 76/396 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4: 19/99. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is indeed 19/99.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to use combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red marbles out of 20 is given by the combination formula C(20,2) = (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 2 marbles out of 45 is C(45,2) = (45*44)/2 = 990.\n\nSo, the probability is 190/990, which simplifies to 19/99.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nIt's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nAlright, so to summarize, the probability that both marbles picked are red is 19/99, or approximately 19.19%.\n\nI hope that makes sense!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{99}} \\]"
