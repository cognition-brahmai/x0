        "content": "Let's find the sum of all prime numbers between 30 and 50. First, I need to identify which numbers in this range are prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nStarting from 31:\n\n- 31: Let's check if it's prime. It's not even, so it's not divisible by 2. The square root of 31 is about 5.57, so I only need to check for divisors up to 5.\n\n- 31 divided by 3 is 10.333... not a whole number.\n\n- 31 divided by 5 is 6.2, not a whole number.\n\nSo, 31 is prime.\n\nNext, 32:\n\n- 32 is even, so it's divisible by 2. Therefore, it's not prime.\n\n33:\n\n- 33 is divisible by 3 (3*11=33), so not prime.\n\n34:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n35:\n\n- Divisible by 5 (5*7=35), not prime.\n\n36:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n37:\n\n- Check for primality: square root is about 6.08, so check up to 5.\n\n- 37 divided by 3 is 12.333... not whole.\n\n- 37 divided by 5 is 7.4, not whole.\n\nSo, 37 is prime.\n\n38:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n39:\n\n- Divisible by 3 (3*13=39), not prime.\n\n40:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n41:\n\n- Check for primality: square root is about 6.403, so check up to 5.\n\n- 41 divided by 3 is 13.666... not whole.\n\n- 41 divided by 5 is 8.2, not whole.\n\nSo, 41 is prime.\n\n42:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n43:\n\n- Check for primality: square root is about 6.557, so check up to 5.\n\n- 43 divided by 3 is 14.333... not whole.\n\n- 43 divided by 5 is 8.6, not whole.\n\nSo, 43 is prime.\n\n44:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n45:\n\n- Divisible by 3 (3*15=45), not prime.\n\n46:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n47:\n\n- Check for primality: square root is about 6.856, so check up to 5.\n\n- 47 divided by 3 is 15.666... not whole.\n\n- 47 divided by 5 is 9.4, not whole.\n\nSo, 47 is prime.\n\n48:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n49:\n\n- 7*7=49, so it's divisible by 7, not prime.\n\n50:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\nSo, the prime numbers between 30 and 50 are: 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.\n\nNow, let's sum them up:\n\n31 + 37 = 68\n\n68 + 41 = 109\n\n109 + 43 = 152\n\n152 + 47 = 199\n\nTherefore, the sum of all prime numbers between 30 and 50 is 199.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{199} \\]"
