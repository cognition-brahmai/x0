        "content": "So there are three people in a room - Alice, Bob, and Carol - and each of them flips a fair coin. We want to find out the probability that exactly two of them will flip heads.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Each person is flipping a coin, and since it's a fair coin, the probability of getting heads (H) is 0.5, and the probability of getting tails (T) is also 0.5. The flips are independent events, meaning one person's flip doesn't affect the others.\n\nSo, we have three independent events, each with two possible outcomes: H or T. The total number of possible outcomes when all three flip their coins is 2^3, which is 8. So, there are 8 possible combinations of H and T.\n\nLet's list them out to visualize better:\n\n1. Alice H, Bob H, Carol H (HHH)\n\n2. Alice H, Bob H, Carol T (HHT)\n\n3. Alice H, Bob T, Carol H (HTH)\n\n4. Alice H, Bob T, Carol T (HTT)\n\n5. Alice T, Bob H, Carol H (THH)\n\n6. Alice T, Bob H, Carol T (THT)\n\n7. Alice T, Bob T, Carol H (TTH)\n\n8. Alice T, Bob T, Carol T (TTT)\n\nNow, we're interested in the scenarios where exactly two of them flip heads. Looking at the list above, those would be:\n\n- HHT (Alice and Bob heads, Carol tails)\n\n- HTH (Alice and Carol heads, Bob tails)\n\n- THH (Bob and Carol heads, Alice tails)\n\nSo, there are three such cases.\n\nThe probability of each specific outcome is the same since each coin flip is independent and fair. The probability of any one of these outcomes is (0.5)^3 = 0.125, because each flip has a 0.5 chance, and there are three flips.\n\nSince there are three favorable outcomes, the total probability is 3 * 0.125 = 0.375.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose exactly two people out of three to flip heads is given by the combination formula C(3,2) = 3. Each of these combinations has a probability of (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^1 = 0.125, since two coins show heads and one shows tails.\n\nSo, again, the total probability is 3 * 0.125 = 0.375.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of them will flip heads is 0.375, or 37.5%.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?\n\nWell, I could consider using the binomial probability formula. The binomial distribution gives the probability of having exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability p.\n\nIn this case, n = 3 (three people flipping coins), k = 2 (exactly two heads), and p = 0.5 (probability of heads).\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(3,2) * (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^(3-2) = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5 = 3 * 0.125 = 0.375\n\nSo, again, we get the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the probability of all possible outcomes:\n\n- Probability of all three heads (HHH): (0.5)^3 = 0.125\n\n- Probability of exactly two heads: 0.375 (as calculated)\n\n- Probability of exactly one head: C(3,1) * (0.5)^1 * (0.5)^2 = 3 * 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.375\n\n- Probability of no heads (all tails): (0.5)^3 = 0.125\n\nIf we add all these probabilities up: 0.125 + 0.375 + 0.375 + 0.125 = 1, which makes sense because they cover all possible outcomes.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The probability that exactly two of them will flip heads is indeed 0.375, or 37.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.375} \\]"
