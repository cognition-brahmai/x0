        "content": "Let's see. I know that in a year, there are 12 months. Out of these, seven months have 31 days. Now, the question is, how many months have 28 days?\n\nWell, I remember that February is the month that usually has 28 days, and in a leap year, it has 29. But the question is about how many months have 28 days, not how many months have exactly 28 days.\n\nSo, thinking about it, February has at least 28 days, and the other months have more. But wait, actually, all months have at least 28 days because even the shortest month, February, has 28 days in a common year and 29 in a leap year.\n\nBut I think the question might be tricky. Maybe it's trying to see if I can think outside the box. So, if I consider that all months have at least 28 days, then all 12 months have 28 days.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29, March has 31, April has 30, May has 31, June has 30, July has 31, August has 31, September has 30, October has 31, November has 30, and December has 31.\n\nSo, every month has at least 28 days. Therefore, all 12 months have 28 days.\n\nBut the question might be expecting a different answer. Maybe it's a trick question to see if I fall for the February trap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me with the initial information about seven months having 31 days. But I think that's just to provide some context about the distribution of days in months.\n\nIn conclusion, since all months have at least 28 days, the answer should be that all 12 months have 28 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
