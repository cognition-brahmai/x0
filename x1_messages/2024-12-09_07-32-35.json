Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how far the train travels in kilometers, and then convert that distance into meters. To find the distance in kilometers, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nThe speed is 90 kilometers per hour, and the time is 4 hours. So, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 90 km/h \u00d7 4 h = 360 kilometers\n\nNow, I need to convert kilometers to meters. I know that 1 kilometer equals 1,000 meters. Therefore, to convert 360 kilometers to meters, I multiply by 1,000:\n\n360 km \u00d7 1,000 m/km = 360,000 meters\n\nSo, the train travels 360,000 meters in 4 hours.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. For example, maybe I can convert the speed to meters per second and then multiply by the time in seconds. That might be another way to find the distance in meters directly.\n\nFirst, convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second.\n\n1 kilometer equals 1,000 meters, and 1 hour equals 3,600 seconds. So, to convert km/h to m/s, I can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 km/h = 1,000 m / 3,600 s = 5/18 m/s\n\nTherefore, 90 km/h is:\n\n90 km/h \u00d7 (5/18) m/s per km/h = 90 \u00d7 5/18 = (90 \u00d7 5)/18 = 450/18 = 25 m/s\n\nSo, the train is traveling at 25 meters per second.\n\nNow, the time is 4 hours. I need to convert that to seconds.\n\n1 hour = 3,600 seconds, so 4 hours = 4 \u00d7 3,600 = 14,400 seconds\n\nNow, using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time again:\n\nDistance = 25 m/s \u00d7 14,400 s = 360,000 meters\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the train travels 360,000 meters in 4 hours.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using dimensional analysis to ensure that the units cancel out correctly.\n\nStarting with the speed: 90 km/h\n\nTime: 4 hours\n\nDistance in kilometers: 90 km/h \u00d7 4 h = 360 km\n\nNow, convert kilometers to meters: 360 km \u00d7 1,000 m/km = 360,000 m\n\nAlternatively, if I want to go directly to meters, I can consider the speed in meters per hour.\n\n1 kilometer = 1,000 meters, so 90 km/h = 90 \u00d7 1,000 m/h = 90,000 m/h\n\nThen, distance in meters: 90,000 m/h \u00d7 4 h = 360,000 m\n\nAgain, the same result. So, no matter which method I use, I end up with 360,000 meters.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the speed was not constant, but the problem says it's an average speed, so using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time should be accurate.\n\nAlso, considering significant figures, the speed is given as 90 km/h, which has two significant figures, and time is 4 hours, which has one significant figure. According to significant figure rules, the answer should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement, which is one significant figure. So, the distance should be reported as 400,000 meters.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the distance in meters and the calculations give 360,000 meters, it's more precise to report 360,000 meters, acknowledging that the original speed had two significant figures.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should consider that the time has two significant figures as well, since 4 hours could be interpreted as 4.0 hours. In that case, the answer should have two significant figures: 360,000 meters.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion with significant figures, I can present the answer in scientific notation: 3.6 \u00d7 10^5 meters.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the level of precision required, I'll stick with 360,000 meters.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the distance traveled, like acceleration or stops. The problem states an average speed, so any acceleration or deceleration is already accounted for in the average speed. There's no mention of stops, so I can assume the train is moving continuously at that average speed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 360,000 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360000} \\]"
