        "content": "Let's see here. I have this list of celestial bodies: Sirius, Earth, Andromeda, Jupiter, Sun, and Milky Way. I need to classify them into stars, planets, or galaxies. Okay, I think I know some of these, but I better make sure I get them right.\n\nFirst up, Sirius. I think Sirius is a star. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the brightest star in the night sky. So, Sirius: star.\n\nNext, Earth. That's easy; Earth is our planet. So, Earth: planet.\n\nAndromeda. Now, Andromeda sounds familiar. I think it's a galaxy, right? Isn't it the closest galaxy to the Milky Way? So, Andromeda: galaxy.\n\nJupiter. That's another planet in our solar system. It's the largest planet, with big red spots and all. So, Jupiter: planet.\n\nSun. Hmm, the Sun. Is the Sun a star or what? Wait, I think it's a star. It provides light and heat to Earth and all the other planets. So, Sun: star.\n\nLastly, Milky Way. I know that's the galaxy we're in. It's a spiral galaxy, isn't it? So, Milky Way: galaxy.\n\nLet me just double-check. Sirius: star. Earth: planet. Andromeda: galaxy. Jupiter: planet. Sun: star. Milky Way: galaxy. Yeah, that seems about right.\n\n**Final Classification:**\n\n- **Stars:** Sirius, Sun\n\n- **Planets:** Earth, Jupiter\n\n- **Galaxies:** Andromeda, Milky Way**"
