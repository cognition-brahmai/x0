        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we've got a person who's saving part of their monthly income over a year, and their savings rate changes halfway through the year. Specifically, they save 5% for the first six months and then bump that up to 10% for the next six months. We want to find out what percentage of their entire annual income they've saved by the end of the year.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what annual income means. Annual income is the total amount of money earned in one year. Since there are 12 months in a year, if someone earns a certain amount each month, their annual income would be 12 times that monthly amount.\n\nLet's denote the monthly income as \"M.\" So, the annual income would be 12M.\n\nNow, the person saves different percentages of their monthly income in two periods: the first six months and the next six months.\n\nIn the first six months, they save 5% of their monthly income. So, each month for the first six months, they save 0.05M.\n\nTherefore, the total savings for the first six months would be:\n\n6 months * 0.05M/month = 0.3M\n\nThen, for the next six months, they increase their savings to 10% of their monthly income. So, each month for the next six months, they save 0.10M.\n\nTherefore, the total savings for the next six months would be:\n\n6 months * 0.10M/month = 0.6M\n\nNow, to find the total savings for the entire year, we add the savings from both periods:\n\nTotal savings = 0.3M + 0.6M = 0.9M\n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage this total savings is of their annual income.\n\nWe know that annual income is 12M, and total savings are 0.9M.\n\nTo find the percentage, we use the formula:\n\n(Total savings / Annual income) * 100%\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(0.9M / 12M) * 100%\n\nThe \"M\" cancels out since it's in both numerator and denominator:\n\n(0.9 / 12) * 100%\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n0.9 divided by 12 is 0.075\n\nThen, multiply by 100% to get the percentage:\n\n0.075 * 100% = 7.5%\n\nSo, the person has saved 7.5% of their annual income.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the total savings as a percentage of annual income directly.\n\nWe know that for the first six months, they save 5% of monthly income each month. So, for six months, that's 6 * 5% = 30% of monthly income saved.\n\nSimilarly, for the next six months, they save 10% each month, which is 6 * 10% = 60% of monthly income saved.\n\nSo, total savings over the year is 30% + 60% = 90% of monthly income.\n\nBut their annual income is 12 months, so 12M.\n\nTherefore, the percentage saved is (0.9M / 12M) * 100% = 7.5%, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the average savings rate over the year.\n\nFor the first six months, savings rate is 5%, and for the next six months, it's 10%.\n\nSo, the average savings rate over the year would be the weighted average of these rates.\n\nSince each period is six months, or half the year, the average savings rate is (5% * 0.5 + 10% * 0.5) = 2.5% + 5% = 7.5%, which again matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that the person has saved 7.5% of their annual income.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose the monthly income varies each month. Would that affect the result?\n\nIn the initial approach, we assumed a constant monthly income M. If monthly income varies, the calculation would be more complex, requiring the sum of savings each month divided by the sum of monthly incomes.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify any variation in monthly income, it's reasonable to assume a constant monthly income.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion remains that the person has saved 7.5% of their annual income.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5\\%} \\]"
