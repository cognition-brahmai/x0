        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students in total, right? Out of these, 18 are boys and 12 are girls. Now, the teacher is going to pick one student at random to answer a question. I need to find out the probability that this student is a girl.\n\nProbability is basically about finding out the chances of something happening. In this case, it's the chance that the student chosen is a girl. To calculate probability, I remember that it's the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the favorable outcome here is selecting a girl, and there are 12 girls. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of students, which is 30.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 12 divided by 30. But I think I can simplify that fraction. Both 12 and 30 can be divided by 6, so 12 divided by 6 is 2, and 30 divided by 6 is 5. So, the simplified fraction is 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. Or, if I want to express it as a percentage, I can multiply 0.4 by 100, which gives me 40%.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a girl is 2/5, or 0.4, or 40%. All of these mean the same thing.\n\nJust to make sure I'm doing this right, let me think again. The total number of students is 30, and girls are 12. So, 12 out of 30 is indeed 2/5.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about the proportion of girls in the class. Since girls make up 12 out of 30 students, their proportion is 12/30, which again simplifies to 2/5.\n\nI think that makes sense. Probability is all about proportions and ratios.\n\nWait a minute, what if there were more categories, like different groups in the class? But in this case, it's just boys and girls, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should remember that probability always ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means it's impossible, and 1 means it's certain. Here, 0.4 is between 0 and 1, so that checks out.\n\nMoreover, if I wanted to find the probability of selecting a boy, it would be 18/30, which simplifies to 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%. And if I add the probabilities of selecting a boy and a girl, it should give me 1, because these are the only two options. Let's check: 2/5 + 3/5 = 5/5, which is 1. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that the selected student is a girl is 2/5, or 0.4, or 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
