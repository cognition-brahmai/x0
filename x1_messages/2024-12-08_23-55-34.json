        "content": "The 19th-century American author who wrote the classic novel \"Moby-Dick\" is Herman Melville. This novel, published in 1851, is considered one of the greatest works of American literature, although it received mixed reviews and modest sales upon its initial release. \"Moby-Dick\" is a complex narrative that explores themes of obsession, justice, and the human condition, set against the backdrop of a whaling voyage. The story follows the narrator, Ishmael, and the obsessive Captain Ahab, who seeks revenge on the white whale that severed his leg on a previous voyage. The novel is renowned for its deep symbolism, intricate character studies, and Melville's profound prose."
