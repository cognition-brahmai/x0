        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a basketball player makes 70% of their free throws, and they attempt 12 free throws in a game. I need to find the probability that they make exactly 8 of them. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that this sounds like a situation where binomial probability might be useful. Binomial probability is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, each free throw is a trial, and making it is a success, while missing is a failure. The probability of success is 70%, or 0.7, and the probability of failure is 30%, or 0.3.\n\nThe formula for binomial probability is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (0.7 here),\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (12 free throws),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successes we're interested in (8 made throws),\n\n- \\( C \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time, which is calculated as \\( \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ P(8) = \\frac{12!}{8! \\times 4!} \\times 0.7^8 \\times 0.3^4 \\]\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the combination \\( \\frac{12!}{8! \\times 4!} \\). Let's see:\n\n12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, but since it's divided by 8!, which is 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, those terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12!}{8!} = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9}{4!} \\]\n\nNow, 4! is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9}{24} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n12 \u00d7 11 = 132\n\n132 \u00d7 10 = 1320\n\n1320 \u00d7 9 = 11880\n\nNow, divide by 24:\n\n11880 \u00f7 24 = 495\n\nSo, C = 495.\n\nNext, calculate \\( 0.7^8 \\).\n\n0.7^8 is 0.7 multiplied by itself 8 times.\n\nLet's compute that step by step:\n\n0.7 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.49\n\n0.49 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.343\n\n0.343 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.2401\n\n0.2401 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.16807\n\n0.16807 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.117649\n\n0.117649 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.0823543\n\n0.0823543 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.05764801\n\nSo, \\( 0.7^8 \\) is approximately 0.05764801.\n\nNow, calculate \\( 0.3^4 \\):\n\n0.3 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.09\n\n0.09 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.027\n\n0.027 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.0081\n\nSo, \\( 0.3^4 = 0.0081 \\).\n\nNow, multiply all three parts together:\n\n\\[ P(8) = 495 \u00d7 0.05764801 \u00d7 0.0081 \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 495 by 0.05764801:\n\n495 \u00d7 0.05764801 \u2248 28.53600495\n\nNow, multiply that by 0.0081:\n\n28.53600495 \u00d7 0.0081 \u2248 0.23118964\n\nSo, the probability of making exactly 8 out of 12 free throws is approximately 0.2312, or 23.12%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the combination part:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{12!}{8! \\times 4!} = \\frac{12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9}{4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1} = \\frac{11880}{24} = 495 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, \\( 0.7^8 \\):\n\n0.7^1 = 0.7\n\n0.7^2 = 0.49\n\n0.7^3 = 0.343\n\n0.7^4 = 0.2401\n\n0.7^5 = 0.16807\n\n0.7^6 = 0.117649\n\n0.7^7 = 0.0823543\n\n0.7^8 = 0.05764801\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( 0.3^4 = 0.0081 \\), which is also correct.\n\nNow, multiplying them together:\n\n495 \u00d7 0.05764801 \u2248 28.536\n\n28.536 \u00d7 0.0081 \u2248 0.2311\n\nSo, yes, approximately 0.2312, or 23.12%.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, I can use a binomial probability calculator or a statistical table, but since I'm doing this manually, I think this is accurate enough.\n\nSo, the probability is about 23.12%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2312} \\]"
