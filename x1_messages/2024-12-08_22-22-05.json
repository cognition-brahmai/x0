        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 20 houses in a village, and each house has either a blue or a red door. The condition is that every house with a blue door is next to two houses with red doors. I need to figure out how many houses have blue doors.\n\nFirst, I should probably try to visualize this. Maybe think of the houses in a row, like a street with houses lined up one after another. So, house 1, house 2, up to house 20.\n\nNow, the condition says that every house with a blue door is next to two houses with red doors. That means, for any house with a blue door, both its neighbors must have red doors.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that satisfies this condition.\n\nSuppose I have a house with a blue door. Then, both neighbors must have red doors. So, it's like B-R-R, where B is blue and R is red.\n\nBut wait, that's only considering one blue house. What if there are multiple blue houses?\n\nLet's think about it. If I have another blue house somewhere, the same condition applies to it: both its neighbors must have red doors.\n\nOne way to approach this is to maximize the number of blue houses while ensuring that each blue house has two red neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to minimize the number of blue houses, but the question doesn't specify whether to maximize or minimize, so maybe there's only one possible configuration.\n\nLet me consider the houses in a loop, like a circle, where house 20 is next to house 1. But maybe it's easier to first consider them in a straight line.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify the arrangement of the houses. Are they in a line or in a circle?\n\nI think the default assumption should be that they are in a line, unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, let's assume they are in a straight line, with house 1 at one end and house 20 at the other end.\n\nIn this case, house 1 can only have a neighbor on its right, and house 20 can only have a neighbor on its left.\n\nBut according to the condition, every house with a blue door must have two red neighbors, which implies both sides.\n\nDoes that mean that blue doors can only be in houses that have two neighbors, i.e., not the first or the last house?\n\nWait, house 1 and house 20 only have one neighbor each. So, if a house has a blue door, it must have two neighbors, both with red doors.\n\nTherefore, blue doors cannot be at house 1 or house 20.\n\nSo, only houses 2 through 19 can have blue doors.\n\nNow, let's think about the arrangement.\n\nSuppose house 2 has a blue door. Then, house 1 and house 3 must have red doors.\n\nBut house 1 is already required to have a red door if house 2 is blue.\n\nSimilarly, if house 3 has a blue door, then house 2 and house 4 must have red doors.\n\nBut house 2 already must have a red door if house 3 is blue.\n\nWait, this seems a bit conflicting.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of patterns.\n\nLet me try to find a repeating pattern that satisfies the condition.\n\nSuppose the pattern is R-B-R-R, R-B-R-R, and so on.\n\nLet me check if this works.\n\nStarting with house 1: R\n\nHouse 2: B\n\nHouse 3: R\n\nHouse 4: R\n\nHouse 5: B\n\nHouse 6: R\n\nHouse 7: R\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, check for blue houses:\n\nHouse 2: neighbors are house 1 (R) and house 3 (R), which satisfies the condition.\n\nHouse 5: neighbors are house 4 (R) and house 6 (R), which satisfies the condition.\n\nSimilarly, every blue house has two red neighbors.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nNow, in this pattern, blue doors are every 4 houses.\n\nSo, in 20 houses, the number of blue doors would be 20 / 4 = 5.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nHouses: 1(R), 2(B), 3(R), 4(R), 5(B), 6(R), 7(R), 8(B), 9(R), 10(R), 11(B), 12(R), 13(R), 14(B), 15(R), 16(R), 17(B), 18(R), 19(R), 20(R)\n\nWait, in this pattern, blue doors are at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17.\n\nThat's 6 blue doors.\n\nBut 20 divided by 4 is 5, but I have 6 blue doors here.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nLet me count again.\n\nStarting with house 1: R\n\n2: B\n\n3: R\n\n4: R\n\n5: B\n\n6: R\n\n7: R\n\n8: B\n\n9: R\n\n10: R\n\n11: B\n\n12: R\n\n13: R\n\n14: B\n\n15: R\n\n16: R\n\n17: B\n\n18: R\n\n19: R\n\n20: R\n\nSo, blue doors are at houses 2,5,8,11,14,17.\n\nThat's 6 blue doors.\n\nBut 4 houses per cycle (R-B-R-R), so in 20 houses, it should be 20 / 4 = 5 cycles, which would suggest 5 blue doors.\n\nBut in my listing, I have 6 blue doors.\n\nWait, maybe my pattern is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is R-B-R-R, R-B-R-R, etc.\n\nBut in that case, every 4 houses have one blue door, so in 20 houses, there should be 5 blue doors.\n\nBut in my listing above, I have 6 blue doors.\n\nThere must be a mistake in my listing.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nHouse 1: R\n\nHouse 2: B\n\nHouse 3: R\n\nHouse 4: R\n\nHouse 5: B\n\nHouse 6: R\n\nHouse 7: R\n\nHouse 8: B\n\nHouse 9: R\n\nHouse 10: R\n\nHouse 11: B\n\nHouse 12: R\n\nHouse 13: R\n\nHouse 14: B\n\nHouse 15: R\n\nHouse 16: R\n\nHouse 17: B\n\nHouse 18: R\n\nHouse 19: R\n\nHouse 20: R\n\nWait, in this pattern, blue doors are at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17.\n\nThat's 6 blue doors.\n\nBut according to the pattern R-B-R-R, that's 4 houses per cycle with one blue door.\n\nIn 20 houses, 20 divided by 4 is 5, but I have 6 blue doors.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern continues beyond the 20th house, which it shouldn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern doesn't perfectly fit into 20 houses.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct pattern is R-B-R-R, R-B-R-R, etc., but adjusted to fit 20 houses.\n\nLet me try starting differently.\n\nSuppose I start with house 1: R\n\nHouse 2: B\n\nHouse 3: R\n\nHouse 4: R\n\nHouse 5: B\n\nHouse 6: R\n\nHouse 7: R\n\nHouse 8: B\n\nHouse 9: R\n\nHouse 10: R\n\nHouse 11: B\n\nHouse 12: R\n\nHouse 13: R\n\nHouse 14: B\n\nHouse 15: R\n\nHouse 16: R\n\nHouse 17: B\n\nHouse 18: R\n\nHouse 19: R\n\nHouse 20: B\n\nWait, but house 20 is blue, and it needs two red neighbors.\n\nBut in this arrangement, house 20 is blue, and its neighbor is house 19 (R) and house 1 (R), assuming a circular arrangement.\n\nBut I initially assumed a linear arrangement.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify whether the houses are in a line or in a circle.\n\nIn a linear arrangement, house 1 only has one neighbor (house 2), and house 20 only has one neighbor (house 19).\n\nIn this case, blue doors can only be in houses 2 through 19, because houses 1 and 20 can't have two neighbors.\n\nBut in my earlier pattern, I had house 17 as blue, and house 20 as red.\n\nWait, in my previous listing, house 20 is red.\n\nBut according to the pattern R-B-R-R repeated, it should be house 20: R.\n\nBut still, in 20 houses, with the pattern R-B-R-R, we have blue doors at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, which is 6 blue doors.\n\nBut 20 divided by 4 is 5, suggesting 5 cycles and thus 5 blue doors.\n\nYet, in this pattern, I have 6 blue doors.\n\nThere must be an error in this approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern isn't perfectly repeating every 4 houses.\n\nPerhaps there's a different way to arrange the doors.\n\nLet me consider that each blue door requires two red neighbors.\n\nSo, for each blue door, there must be red doors on both sides.\n\nThis means that blue doors can't be adjacent to each other.\n\nIn fact, there must be at least one red door between any two blue doors.\n\nWait, actually, in the pattern I have (R-B-R-R), there are two red doors between blue doors.\n\nBut in my listing, I have blue doors at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, which are every 3 houses.\n\nWait, no, 2 to 5 is 3 houses apart, 5 to 8 is 3, and so on.\n\nBut in the pattern R-B-R-R, it's a cycle of 4 houses, but in my listing, blue doors are every 3 houses.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nLet me denote B for blue and R for red.\n\nGiven that every B must be between two R's.\n\nSo, the sequence must be R-B-R, and the remaining houses can be R or B, but with the same condition.\n\nWait, but in a linear arrangement, house 1 can't be B because it only has one neighbor.\n\nSimilarly, house 20 can't be B for the same reason.\n\nSo, only houses 2 through 19 can be B, provided their neighbors are R.\n\nWait, but in my earlier pattern, house 17 is B, and house 20 is R.\n\nBut house 17 has neighbors house 16 (R) and house 18 (R), which satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, in that case, it's acceptable.\n\nBut I still have the discrepancy in the number of blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a maximum number of blue doors possible under this condition.\n\nLet me consider that each B requires two R's adjacent to it.\n\nIn other words, each B consumes two R's as its neighbors.\n\nSo, for n blue doors, we need at least 2n red doors.\n\nBut in a linear arrangement of 20 houses, with houses 1 and

wait, actually, in the pattern R-B-R-R, the blue house at position 2 has neighbors 1(R) and 3(R), and the blue house at position 5 has neighbors 4(R) and 6(R), and so on.\n\nSo, in this pattern, blue houses are separated by two red houses.\n\nThis ensures that each blue house has its own two red neighbors.\n\nIn this case, in 20 houses, how many blue houses are there?\n\nPositions: 2,5,8,11,14,17.\n\nThat's 6 blue houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different pattern that allows more or fewer blue houses.\n\nBut let's check if this is the only possible pattern.\n\nSuppose I try to have more blue houses, say, every 3 houses: R-B-R-R-B-R-R-B-R-R-B-R-R-B-R-R-B-R.\n\nWait, in this pattern, blue houses are at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, which is again 6 blue houses.\n\nBut in this arrangement, house 17 has neighbors 16(R) and 18(R), which are both red.\n\nSimilarly, house 20 is R.\n\nSo, this seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to have fewer blue houses.\n\nFor example, if I have a pattern like R-B-R-R-R, but then house 5 is B, with neighbors 4(R) and 6(R), which is fine.\n\nBut in this case, house 2 is B with neighbors 1(R) and 3(R), and house 5 is B with neighbors 4(R) and 6(R), and so on.\n\nThis would result in blue houses at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, again 6 blue houses.\n\nIt seems like in any pattern where blue houses are separated by two red houses, I end up with 6 blue houses in 20 houses.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that in a 4-house cycle (R-B-R-R), repeated 5 times in 20 houses, there should be 5 blue houses.\n\nYet, in practice, it's 6 blue houses.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the positions.\n\nLet me count again.\n\nStarting with house 1: R\n\nHouse 2: B\n\nHouse 3: R\n\nHouse 4: R\n\nHouse 5: B\n\nHouse 6: R\n\nHouse 7: R\n\nHouse 8: B\n\nHouse 9: R\n\nHouse 10: R\n\nHouse 11: B\n\nHouse 12: R\n\nHouse 13: R\n\nHouse 14: B\n\nHouse 15: R\n\nHouse 16: R\n\nHouse 17: B\n\nHouse 18: R\n\nHouse 19: R\n\nHouse 20: R\n\nSo, blue houses are at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, which is 6 blue houses.\n\nBut according to the cycle R-B-R-R, which is 4 houses per cycle, in 20 houses, there should be 5 cycles, hence 5 blue houses.\n\nHowever, in this arrangement, there are 6 blue houses.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern wraps around somehow.\n\nWait, in positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, that's every 3 houses starting from position 2.\n\nWait, no, 2 to 5 is 3 positions (2,3,4,5), but it's every 3rd position starting from 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of modulo arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only way to have the pattern fit into 20 houses is to have 6 blue houses, but that doesn't align with the cycle length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different pattern that allows fewer blue houses.\n\nSuppose I try to space the blue houses further apart.\n\nFor example, R-B-R-R-R, which is R-B-R-R-R.\n\nThen, blue houses are at positions 2,6,10,14,18.\n\nThat's 5 blue houses.\n\nLet me check if this satisfies the condition.\n\nHouse 2: neighbors 1(R) and 3(R), which is fine.\n\nHouse 6: neighbors 5(R) and 7(R), which is fine.\n\nHouse 10: neighbors 9(R) and 11(R), which is fine.\n\nHouse 14: neighbors 13(R) and 15(R), which is fine.\n\nHouse 18: neighbors 17(R) and 19(R), which is fine.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, I have 5 blue houses.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, in the first pattern I considered, with 6 blue houses, that also works.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nIs there only one possible number of blue houses, or can there be different numbers?\n\nWait, in the first pattern, with 6 blue houses, it satisfies the condition.\n\nIn another pattern, with 5 blue houses, it also satisfies the condition.\n\nDoes that mean there are multiple possible numbers of blue houses?\n\nBut the problem is to find how many houses have blue doors, implying there's a specific number.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the maximum or minimum number possible.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify maximum or minimum, just \"how many houses have blue doors.\"\n\nMaybe there's only one possible configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique number that satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement isn't possible at all.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that some houses cannot be blue due to the constraints.\n\nLet me consider the constraints more carefully.\n\nEvery house with a blue door must have two red neighbors.\n\nBut houses 1 and 20 cannot have blue doors because they only have one neighbor.\n\nSo, only houses 2 through 19 can have blue doors.\n\nThat's 18 houses that can potentially have blue doors.\n\nBut each blue door requires its two neighbors to be red.\n\nSo, for each blue door, its two neighbors must be red.\n\nAlso, red doors can be adjacent to any other doors.\n\nLet me think in terms of graph theory.\n\nEach house is a node, and edges connect neighboring houses.\n\nThis would be a linear graph with 20 nodes.\n\nWe need to assign colors to the nodes such that every B has two R neighbors.\n\nThis is similar to a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or to find a recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sequence where B must be preceded and followed by R.\n\nIn other words, B can only appear if both neighbors are R.\n\nSo, perhaps I can think in terms of placing B's in the sequence, ensuring that each B has R's on both sides.\n\nThis is similar to placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, but perhaps a different analogy would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this using binary sequences with certain restrictions.\n\nLet me try to define a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote by a_n the number of valid sequences of n houses.\n\nWait, but the problem is not to count the number of valid sequences, but to find the number of blue doors in a valid sequence.\n\nBut perhaps finding a recurrence relation can help me understand the structure of the sequences.\n\nLet me define a_n as the number of valid sequences for n houses.\n\nI need to consider the possibilities for the first house.\n\nHouse 1 can be R or B.\n\nBut, house 1 can't be B because it only has one neighbor, house 2.\n\nSo, house 1 must be R.\n\nSimilarly, house n must be R.\n\nTherefore, a_n = number of sequences where house 1 and house n are R, and for houses 2 through n-1, any house with B has both neighbors R.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of counting sequences where B's are isolated by R's, except that houses 1 and n must be R.\n\nThis is akin to placing B's in the sequence such that no two B's are adjacent and each B is not at the end.\n\nWait, but in this problem, each B must have R's on both sides, but B's can be separated by multiple R's.\n\nSo, it's similar to placing B's with at least one R on each side.\n\nBut in my earlier pattern, I had B's separated by two R's.\n\nWait, in the condition, each B must have two R's adjacent to it, meaning both neighbors are R.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I place B's separated by two R's, like R-B-R-R-B-R-R-..., then each B has R's on both sides.\n\nBut in this arrangement, in 20 houses, I have 6 B's.\n\nAlternatively, if I place B's separated by three R's, like R-B-R-R-R-B-R-R-R-..., then each B has R's on both sides, and in 20 houses, I might have fewer B's.\n\nWait, in this case, with R-B-R-R-R-B-R-R-R-B-..., the positions would be:\n\nHouse 1: R\n\nHouse 2: B\n\nHouse 3: R\n\nHouse 4: R\n\nHouse 5: R\n\nHouse 6: B\n\nHouse 7: R\n\nHouse 8: R\n\nHouse 9: R\n\nHouse 10: B\n\nHouse 11: R\n\nHouse 12: R\n\nHouse 13: R\n\nHouse 14: B\n\nHouse 15: R\n\nHouse 16: R\n\nHouse 17: R\n\nHouse 18: B\n\nHouse 19: R\n\nHouse 20: R\n\nIn this arrangement, blue houses are at positions 2,6,10,14,18, which is 5 blue houses.\n\nWait, but in this pattern, each B has R's on both sides, satisfying the condition.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, there are 5 blue houses.\n\nIn the earlier pattern with B's every 3 houses, there are 6 blue houses.\n\nSo, different patterns lead to different numbers of blue houses.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there isn't a unique number of blue houses, but the problem might be to find the maximum or minimum number possible.\n\nBut the problem states: \"how many houses have blue doors?\" implying there's a specific number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's only one possible configuration that satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find the number of blue houses in terms of the entire sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of blocks.\n\nSuppose I have a block of R-B-R-R, which satisfies the condition for one B.\n\nThen, I can repeat this block.\n\nIn 20 houses, 20 divided by 4 is 5, so 5 blocks would give 5 B's.\n\nBut in practice, when I list them, I get 6 B's.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern doesn't perfectly fit into 20 houses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is R-B-R-R, repeated 5 times, giving positions 2,6,10,14,18 for B's, which is 5 B's.\n\nWait, in my earlier listing, I had positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, which is every 3 houses, resulting in 6 B's.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the cycle length of 4.\n\nPerhaps the correct cycle length is 4, leading to 5 B's in 20 houses.\n\nBut in that case, the positions would be 2,6,10,14,18, which is 5 B's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different way to arrange the doors to have more B's.\n\nWait, suppose I arrange the houses in a pattern like R-B-R-R-B-R-R-B-R-R-B-R-R-B-R-R-B-R.\n\nIn this case, blue houses are at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, which is 6 B's.\n\nBut in this arrangement, each B has R's on both sides.\n\nFor example, house 5 has neighbors 4(R) and 6(R), which are both red.\n\nSimilarly, house 2 has neighbors 1(R) and 3(R), and house 17 has neighbors 16(R) and 18(R).\n\nSo, this seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nBut according to the cycle of 4 houses (R-B-R-R), repeated 5 times in 20 houses, there should be 5 B's.\n\nBut in this arrangement, there are 6 B's.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern doesn't perfectly repeat every 4 houses in 20 houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern needs to be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way to have 5 B's is by having them every 4 houses, positions 2,6,10,14,18.\n\nAlternatively, to have 6 B's, positions 2,5,8,11,14,17.\n\nBut in the latter case, the cycle isn't exactly 4 houses; it's 3 houses between B's.\n\nWait, the distance between B's in the first pattern is 4 houses (e.g., 2 to 6 is 4 houses: 2,3,4,5,6), but in the second pattern, it's 3 houses (2 to 5: 2,3,4,5).\n\nWait, no, from house 2 to house 5 is 3 houses: 2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, from house 5 to house 8 is 3 houses: 5,6,7,8.\n\nWait, but in the first pattern with 5 B's, the distance is 4 houses: 2,6,10,14,18.\n\nSo, in that case, the distance between B's is 4 houses.\n\nIn the second pattern with 6 B's, the distance is 3 houses.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWell, both patterns satisfy the condition that each B has two R neighbors.\n\nTherefore, both are valid.\n\nSo, in one arrangement, there are 5 B's, and in another, there are 6 B's.\n\nDoes that mean there are multiple possible numbers of blue doors?\n\nBut the problem is phrased as \"how many houses have blue doors?\", suggesting there's a single answer.\n\nPerhaps there's a unique number that satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement isn't possible at all.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the entire sequence more carefully.\n\nLet me consider that each B requires its two neighbors to be R.\n\nSo, for each B, its left and right neighbors must be R.\n\nThis means that no two B's can be adjacent, and moreover, there cannot be B's with only one R in between.\n\nIn other words, B's must be separated by at least two R's.\n\nIn the first pattern I considered (R-B-R-R repeated), B's are separated by two R's, which satisfies the condition.\n\nIn the second pattern (R-B-R-R-B-R-R-...), B's are separated by two R's, which also satisfies the condition.\n\nBut in the first pattern, there are 5 B's in 20 houses, and in the second pattern, there are 6 B's in 20 houses.\n\nWait, perhaps the second pattern doesn't actually work.\n\nLet me check the positions again.\n\nPositions: 2,5,8,11,14,17.\n\nSo, from house 2 to house 5: houses 2,3,4,5.\n\nHouse 2: B, neighbors 1(R) and 3(R).\n\nHouse 5: B, neighbors 4(R) and 6(R).\n\nHouse 8: B, neighbors 7(R) and 9(R).\n\nHouse 11: B, neighbors 10(R) and 12(R).\n\nHouse 14: B, neighbors 13(R) and 15(R).\n\nHouse 17: B, neighbors 16(R) and 18(R).\n\nAll B's have two R neighbors.\n\nHouse 20 is R.\n\nSo, this arrangement works.\n\nSimilarly, in the first pattern with positions 2,6,10,14,18, that also works.\n\nSo, both arrangements satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, there are at least two possible numbers of blue doors: 5 and 6.\n\nBut the problem is likely expecting a single answer.\n\nPerhaps there's a unique number that satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mathematical constraint that forces a specific number.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of blue doors as b.\n\nEach blue door requires two red neighbors.\n\nHowever, in a linear arrangement, the total number of red doors needed is not simply 2b, because some red doors may be shared as neighbors for multiple blue doors.\n\nWait, in a linear arrangement, the minimum number of red doors required to have b blue doors, each with two red neighbors, can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach blue door requires two red neighbors, but if blue doors are separated by at least two red doors, then the total number of red doors is at least 2b.\n\nBut in practice, with overlapping neighbors, it can be less.\n\nWait, in the first pattern with 5 blue doors and 15 red doors, it works.\n\nIn the second pattern with 6 blue doors and 14 red doors, it also works.\n\nWait, in the second pattern, with 6 blue doors, the number of red doors is 14.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, each blue door requires two red neighbors, so 6 blue doors would require at least 12 red doors.\n\nBut in this arrangement, there are 14 red doors, which is more than 12.\n\nSo, it satisfies the condition.\n\nBut in the first pattern, with 5 blue doors and 15 red doors, it also satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, both are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more possible numbers of blue doors.\n\nFor example, with fewer blue doors.\n\nSuppose only 4 blue doors: positions 2,7,12,17.\n\nLet me check:\n\nHouse 2: neighbors 1(R) and 3(R).\n\nHouse 7: neighbors 6(R) and 8(R).\n\nHouse 12: neighbors 11(R) and 13(R).\n\nHouse 17: neighbors 16(R) and 18(R).\n\nThis works, with 4 blue doors and the rest red.\n\nSimilarly, with 3 blue doors: positions 2,8,14.\n\nHouse 2: neighbors 1(R) and 3(R).\n\nHouse 8: neighbors 7(R) and 9(R).\n\nHouse 14: neighbors 13(R) and 15(R).\n\nThis also works.\n\nSo, it seems like there are multiple possible numbers of blue doors: 3,4,5,6, possibly more.\n\nBut the problem is likely expecting a single answer, so perhaps there's a unique number that fits the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement isn't possible at all, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a unique solution based on the constraints.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that some blue doors share red neighbors.\n\nFor example, if two blue doors are separated by exactly two red doors, then the middle red door is a neighbor to both blue doors.\n\nIn this case, the total number of red doors required is less than 2b.\n\nBut in the earlier patterns, I haven't overlapped the red neighbors.\n\nIn the pattern R-B-R-R-B-R-R-..., each B has its own two R neighbors, without sharing.\n\nIn this case, the number of red doors is 14 for 6 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, if I arrange the blue doors with more separation, I can have fewer blue doors.\n\nFor example, with blue doors every 5 houses: positions 2,7,12,17.\n\nThat's 4 blue doors.\n\nEach has two red neighbors.\n\nSo, it works.\n\nAlternatively, with blue doors every 6 houses: positions 2,8,14.\n\nThat's 3 blue doors.\n\nEach has two red neighbors.\n\nSo, that works too.\n\nTherefore, it seems like there are multiple possible numbers of blue doors.\n\nBut the problem is phrased in a way that suggests there's a single answer.\n\nPerhaps I need to find the maximum number of blue doors possible.\n\nIn the pattern with blue doors every 3 houses: positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, which is 6 blue doors.\n\nIs it possible to have more than 6 blue doors?\n\nSuppose I try to place blue doors every 2 houses: positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18.\n\nBut in this case, house 4 has neighbors 3(R) and 5.\n\nBut house 4 is blue, so house 5 must be red.\n\nSimilarly, house 6 is blue, so house 5 must be red and house 7 must be red.\n\nBut house 4 is blue with neighbors 3(R) and 5(R), and house 6 is blue with neighbors 5(R) and 7(R).\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, blue doors are at positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18.\n\nThat's 9 blue doors.\n\nEach has two red neighbors.\n\nSo, this seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the pattern R-B-R-R allows 5 blue doors, and R-B-R allows more.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider the condition.\n\nThe condition is that every house with a blue door must have two red neighbors.\n\nIt doesn't say that a house with red door must have specific neighbors.\n\nSo, in the arrangement where blue doors are every 2 houses, like positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, with red doors at 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,20.\n\nIn this arrangement, each blue door has two red neighbors.\n\nFor example, house 4 has neighbors 3(R) and 5(R), house 6 has neighbors 5(R) and 7(R), and so on.\n\nSo, this seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, it's possible to have up to 9 blue doors.\n\nBut earlier, I had patterns with 5 and 6 blue doors, and now 9.\n\nIs there a maximum number?\n\nWait, in this arrangement with 9 blue doors, it seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can have even more blue doors.\n\nSuppose I try to place blue doors at positions 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18.\n\nBut in this case, house 3 is blue with neighbors 2(B) and 4(R).\n\nWait, house 2 is blue, so house 3 being blue would have house 2(B) as its left neighbor, which violates the condition that both neighbors must be R.\n\nTherefore, blue doors cannot be adjacent.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, house 3 has a blue neighbor on its left, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, blue doors cannot be adjacent.\n\nSo, in my earlier arrangement where blue doors are every 2 houses, like positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, that works because there is one red door between each pair of blue doors.\n\nWait, no, in that arrangement, blue doors are separated by one red door.\n\nSo, house 2 is B with neighbors 1(R) and 3(R), house 4 is B with neighbors 3(R) and 5(R), and so on.\n\nEach blue door has two red neighbors.\n\nSo, this arrangement works.\n\nBut if I try to place blue doors closer together, say every house alternate: B-R-B-R-B-..., but in this case, each blue door would have one red neighbor and one blue neighbor, which violates the condition that both neighbors must be red.\n\nTherefore, the minimal separation between blue doors is two red doors.\n\nWait, no, in the arrangement B-R-B-R-B-..., each blue door has one red neighbor and one blue neighbor, which doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, blue doors must be separated by at least one red door.\n\nIn other words, blue doors cannot be adjacent.\n\nBut in the arrangement with blue doors every two houses, like positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, blue doors are separated by one red door, and this satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, there are 9 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, with blue doors every three houses, like positions 2,5,8,11,14,17, which is 6 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, with blue doors every four houses, like positions 2,6,10,14,18, which is 5 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, with blue doors every five houses, like positions 2,7,12,17, which is 4 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, with blue doors every six houses, like positions 2,8,14, which is 3 blue doors.\n\nSo, multiple numbers are possible.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to find the maximum number of blue doors possible.\n\nIn that case, the arrangement with blue doors every two houses, separated by one red door, allows 9 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better arrangement that allows more blue doors.\n\nBut if I try to place more than 9 blue doors, for example, 10 blue doors, that would require placing blue doors at positions 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, house 3 being blue would have house 2(B) as its neighbor, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, blue doors cannot be adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of blue doors is when they are placed every two houses, starting from house 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, which is 9 blue doors.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, house 19 is R, and house 20 is R.\n\nHouse 18 is B with neighbors 17(R) and 19(R), which is fine.\n\nSo, 9 blue doors seem possible.\n\nIs it possible to have 10 blue doors?\n\nIf I try to add house 20 as blue, but house 20 only has one neighbor, house 19(R), which is fine, but the condition requires both neighbors to be red for blue doors, and house 20 only has one neighbor, which is house 19(R).\n\nWait, the condition says \"every house with a blue door is next to two houses with red doors.\"\n\nHouse 20 only has one neighbor, house 19(R), so it doesn't have two red neighbors.\n\nTherefore, house 20 cannot be blue.\n\nSimilarly, house 1 cannot be blue because it only has one neighbor.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of blue doors is 9, in positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18.\n\nEach blue door has two red neighbors, and no blue door is adjacent to another blue door.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 9 blue doors.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the answer was 5 or 6, depending on the pattern.\n\nBut according to this, 9 is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum number of blue doors.\n\nBut in that case, it could be as low as 0, if all doors are red.\n\nBut the problem likely expects the maximum number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique number based on the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to determine the number of blue doors.\n\nLet me consider that in a linear arrangement of n houses, with houses 1 and

actually, in this arrangement, each blue house has a red house on both sides, satisfying the condition.\n\nTherefore, in a linear arrangement of 20 houses, with houses 1 and 20 being red, and the rest alternating between blue and red (B-R-B-R-...), you can have blue houses at positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, which is 9 blue houses.\n\nThis seems to be the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a way to arrange more blue houses by having some blue houses share red neighbors.\n\nBut in the alternating pattern, each blue house has its own two red neighbors, without sharing any red neighbor with another blue house.\n\nTherefore, it seems that 9 is the maximum number of blue houses possible.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that in a different pattern, like R-B-R-R, repeated, I could have 5 blue houses.\n\nOr in another pattern, R-B-R-R-B-R-R-..., resulting in 6 blue houses.\n\nBut in the alternating pattern, I can have 9 blue houses, which seems better.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is 9.\n\nBut perhaps I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me consider that in a linear arrangement of n houses, the maximum number of blue houses is floor((n-2)/2).\n\nWait, no, in my earlier arrangement, with n=20, floor((20-2)/2)=9, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's floor(n/2).\n\nBut floor(20/2)=10, but in reality, with the constraints, I can only have 9 blue houses.\n\nWait, no, in the alternating pattern B-R-B-R-..., with houses 1 and 20 being red, I have 9 blue houses.\n\nIf I try to have house 19 as blue, with neighbors 18(R) and 20(R), but house 20 is red, so house 19 can be blue.\n\nWait, house 19 can be blue, with neighbors 18(R) and 20(R).\n\nIn that case, blue houses would be at positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,19, which is 10 blue houses.\n\nBut wait, house 18 is blue with neighbors 17(R) and 19(B), but house 19 is blue, which would mean house 18 has a blue neighbor, which violates the condition.\n\nWait, no, house 18 has neighbors 17(R) and 19(B).\n\nBut the condition requires both neighbors to be red for a blue house.\n\nTherefore, house 18 cannot have house 19 as a blue neighbor.\n\nTherefore, if house 19 is blue, its neighbors are 18(R) and 20(R), which is fine.\n\nBut house 18 cannot be blue if house 19 is blue, because then house 18 would have house 19(B) as its neighbor, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, in the arrangement where house 19 is blue, house 18 must be red.\n\nSimilarly, house 17 can be blue with neighbors 16(R) and 18(R).\n\nSo, in this case, blue houses at positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,19, which is 9 blue houses.\n\nAlternatively, blue houses at positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, which is also 9 blue houses.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the maximum number of blue houses is 9.\n\nHence, the answer should be 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
