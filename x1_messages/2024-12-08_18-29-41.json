        "content": "So, the baker uses 3 eggs to make one cake, and he has 27 eggs in total. I need to find out how many cakes he can make with those 27 eggs.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. It's a division problem because I need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs used per cake.\n\nSo, total eggs are 27, and eggs per cake are 3. So, the number of cakes would be 27 divided by 3.\n\nLet me write that down: Number of cakes = total eggs / eggs per cake = 27 / 3.\n\nNow, I know that 3 times 9 is 27, so 27 divided by 3 should be 9.\n\nLet me check that: 3 times 9 is indeed 27.\n\nSo, the baker can make 9 cakes with 27 eggs.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe there's a formula or something I should use.\n\nWait, actually, in baking, sometimes there are constraints other than just the number of eggs. Like, maybe he needs flour, sugar, etc., but the problem only mentions eggs, so maybe eggs are the limiting factor here.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then yes, dividing total eggs by eggs per cake gives the number of cakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of subtraction. If he uses 3 eggs for each cake, then for each cake he makes, he subtracts 3 eggs from the total.\n\nSo, starting with 27 eggs:\n\nAfter 1 cake: 27 - 3 = 24 eggs left\n\nAfter 2 cakes: 24 - 3 = 21 eggs left\n\nAfter 3 cakes: 21 - 3 = 18 eggs left\n\nAfter 4 cakes: 18 - 3 = 15 eggs left\n\nAfter 5 cakes: 15 - 3 = 12 eggs left\n\nAfter 6 cakes: 12 - 3 = 9 eggs left\n\nAfter 7 cakes: 9 - 3 = 6 eggs left\n\nAfter 8 cakes: 6 - 3 = 3 eggs left\n\nAfter 9 cakes: 3 - 3 = 0 eggs left\n\nSo, again, he can make 9 cakes before he runs out of eggs.\n\nThis matches the answer I got from division, which is a good sign.\n\nMaybe I can also think about it in terms of multiplication. If each cake requires 3 eggs, then to find out how many cakes he can make with 27 eggs, I can set up the equation:\n\nNumber of cakes * eggs per cake = total eggs\n\nSo, number of cakes * 3 = 27\n\nThen, number of cakes = 27 / 3 = 9\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 1 cake requires 3 eggs, then how many cakes can be made from 27 eggs?\n\nThis is simply 27 divided by 3, which is 9.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 9 cakes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any remainder.\n\n27 divided by 3 is 9 with no remainder, since 3 times 9 is exactly 27.\n\nSo, he can make exactly 9 cakes with no eggs left over.\n\nIf the division had left a remainder, say, if he had 28 eggs, then 28 divided by 3 is 9 with a remainder of 1 egg, which isn't enough to make another cake, so still only 9 cakes.\n\nBut in this case, it's exact.\n\nTherefore, the baker can make 9 cakes with 27 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
