        "content": "Yes, spinach is known for its high iron content compared to many other vegetables. A 100-gram serving of spinach provides about 2.71 mg of iron, which is significantly higher than many other leafy greens. However, it's important to note that the iron in spinach is non-heme iron, which is not as easily absorbed by the body as heme iron found in animal products. To enhance iron absorption from spinach, it's helpful to consume it with vitamin C-rich foods."
