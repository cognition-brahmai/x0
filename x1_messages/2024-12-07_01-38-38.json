        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about villagers and their eye colors. It says that half of the villagers have blue eyes, one-third have green eyes, and the rest have brown eyes. And it tells me that there are 60 villagers with green eyes. I need to find out how many have brown eyes.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the total number of villagers in the village. Because half have blue eyes and one-third have green eyes, I can express the fractions of the village that have each eye color.\n\nLet me denote the total number of villagers as V.\n\nSo, villagers with blue eyes: (1/2) * V\n\nVillagers with green eyes: (1/3) * V\n\nVillagers with brown eyes: the rest, which would be V - [(1/2)V + (1/3)V]\n\nI know that the number of villagers with green eyes is 60, so:\n\n(1/3)V = 60\n\nFrom this, I can solve for V.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\nV = 60 * 3\n\nV = 180\n\nSo, there are 180 villagers in total.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many have brown eyes.\n\nFirst, find the number of villagers with blue eyes:\n\n(1/2)*180 = 90\n\nGreen eyes: 60\n\nSo, brown eyes would be:\n\nTotal villagers - (blue eyes + green eyes)\n\n180 - (90 + 60) = 180 - 150 = 30\n\nTherefore, 30 villagers have brown eyes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nTotal villagers: 180\n\nBlue eyes: 90\n\nGreen eyes: 60\n\nBrown eyes: 30\n\nAdding them up: 90 + 60 + 30 = 180, which matches the total.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the fraction that has brown eyes.\n\nFraction with brown eyes: 1 - (1/2 + 1/3)\n\nFirst, find 1/2 + 1/3.\n\nTo add fractions, find a common denominator, which is 6 in this case.\n\n(1/2) = 3/6\n\n(1/3) = 2/6\n\nSo, 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6\n\nTherefore, fraction with brown eyes: 1 - 5/6 = 1/6\n\nSo, (1/6)*180 = 30, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nYeah, I think 30 is the correct number of villagers with brown eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
