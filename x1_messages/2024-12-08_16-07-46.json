Hmm.\n\nNext, you don't have lungs, but you need air. So, it must be something that requires oxygen to function, but it doesn't have lungs like animals do. Maybe it's something that reacts with oxygen or depends on it in some way.\n\nAnd then, you don't have a mouth, but water kills you. So, it can't handle water; water is detrimental to it. Maybe it's sensitive to moisture or water causes it to degrade or stop functioning.\n\nPutting all these clues together, I'm trying to think of something that grows without being alive, needs air but doesn't have lungs, and is killed by water.\n\nIs it fire? Fire grows, but it's not alive. It needs oxygen to burn, so it needs air. And water extinguishes fire, so water kills it. That seems to fit all the clues.\n\nYes, fire fits the description perfectly. It's not alive, it grows as it burns, it needs oxygen from the air, and water puts it out.\n\nSo, the answer is fire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{fire}} \\]"
