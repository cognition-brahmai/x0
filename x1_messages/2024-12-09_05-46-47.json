        "content": "The Constitution of the United States was officially ratified on June 21, 1788. This occurred when New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the document, meeting the requirement set by the Constitutional Convention that at least nine of the thirteen original states needed to approve it for it to take effect. The ratification process was a crucial step in establishing the new federal government under the Constitution, replacing the earlier Articles of Confederation."
