        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem here. A group of people wants to split a $300 gift equally among themselves. But then, two more people join the group, and because of that, everyone's share decreases by $5. I need to find out how many people were originally in the group.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to understand this step by step. Let\u2019s denote the original number of people in the group as \\( n \\). So, originally, each person was supposed to pay \\( \\frac{300}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nThen, two more people join the group, so now there are \\( n + 2 \\) people. With this new group size, each person's share becomes \\( \\frac{300}{n + 2} \\) dollars.\n\nAccording to the problem, when these two people join, everyone's share is reduced by $5. That means the new share is $5 less than the original share. So, I can set up an equation like this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{n} - \\frac{300}{n + 2} = 5\n\\]\n\nOkay, that seems right. Now, I need to solve for \\( n \\). This looks a bit tricky because there are denominators involved. Maybe I can find a common denominator or something to simplify this equation.\n\nLet me try to find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are \\( n \\) and \\( n + 2 \\), so the common denominator would be \\( n(n + 2) \\).\n\nLet me rewrite the equation with this common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300(n + 2) - 300n}{n(n + 2)} = 5\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[\n300(n + 2) - 300n = 300n + 600 - 300n = 600\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{600}{n(n + 2)} = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, I can solve for \\( n \\) by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n600 = 5n(n + 2)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5 to simplify:\n\n\\[\n120 = n(n + 2)\n\\]\n\nSo, expanding the right side:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 2n - 120 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: \\( n^2 + 2n - 120 = 0 \\). I need to solve for \\( n \\). I can try factoring this equation.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -120 and add up to 2. Hmm, let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of -120:\n\n- 1 and -120\n\n- 2 and -60\n\n- 3 and -40\n\n- 4 and -30\n\n- 5 and -24\n\n- 6 and -20\n\n- 8 and -15\n\n- 10 and -12\n\nOh, 10 and -12 multiply to -120 and add up to -2, which is not what I need. I need numbers that add up to 2.\n\nWait, maybe 12 and -10:\n\n12 + (-10) = 2\n\n12 * (-10) = -120\n\nYes, that works. So, I can factor the quadratic equation as:\n\n\\[\n(n + 12)(n - 10) = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives:\n\n\\[\nn + 12 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( n = -12 \\) or \\( n = 10 \\)\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, \\( n = 10 \\) is the valid solution.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. Original number of people is 10. So, original share per person is \\( \\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\) dollars.\n\nThen, two more people join, making it 12 people. New share per person is \\( \\frac{300}{12} = 25 \\) dollars.\n\n indeed, 25 is 5 dollars less than 30. Perfect, it checks out.\n\nSo, the original number of people in the group was 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
