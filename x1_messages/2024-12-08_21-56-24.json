        "content": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = ln(x\u00b2 + 1), we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of the composition of two or more functions.\n\nHere, the function f(x) can be thought of as the composition of two functions: the natural logarithm function ln(u) and the function u = x\u00b2 + 1.\n\nSo, f(x) = ln(u), where u = x\u00b2 + 1.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of f with respect to x is the derivative of ln(u) with respect to u, multiplied by the derivative of u with respect to x.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n\nf'(x) = (d/dx)[ln(u)] * (d/dx)[u]\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of ln(u) with respect to u:\n\n(d/du)[ln(u)] = 1/u\n\nNext, we find the derivative of u = x\u00b2 + 1 with respect to x:\n\n(d/dx)[x\u00b2 + 1] = 2x\n\nNow, applying the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = (1/u) * (2x)\n\nBut remember that u = x\u00b2 + 1, so substitute back:\n\nf'(x) = (1/(x\u00b2 + 1)) * (2x)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 2x / (x\u00b2 + 1)\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) = ln(x\u00b2 + 1) is f'(x) = 2x / (x\u00b2 + 1).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2x}{x^{2} + 1}} \\]"
