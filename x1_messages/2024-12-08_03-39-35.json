        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got an amusement park designing a new roller coaster, and they need to figure out how many hours it needs to operate each day to handle all the visitors who want to ride it during peak season.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many visitors actually want to ride the roller coaster. The park expects 4,000 visitors per day, and 60% of them want to ride the new roller coaster. So, let's calculate that:\n\nNumber of visitors wanting to ride = Total visitors * Percentage wanting to ride\n= 4,000 * 0.60\n= 2,400 visitors\n\nAlright, so 2,400 visitors want to ride the roller coaster each day.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many passengers the roller coaster can transport per cycle. The maximum capacity is 30 passengers per ride. But we also need to consider the time it takes to complete one cycle, which is 5 minutes. To find out how many rides can be operated in an hour, we need to divide 60 minutes by the cycle time.\n\nNumber of cycles per hour = 60 minutes / 5 minutes per cycle\n= 12 cycles per hour\n\nSo, the roller coaster can operate 12 cycles each hour.\n\nNow, to find out how many passengers can be transported per hour, we multiply the number of cycles per hour by the number of passengers per cycle.\n\nPassengers per hour = Cycles per hour * Passengers per cycle\n= 12 * 30\n= 360 passengers per hour\n\nGreat, so the roller coaster can handle 360 passengers every hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours the roller coaster needs to operate to accommodate all 2,400 visitors who want to ride.\n\nTotal hours needed = Total passengers wanting to ride / Passengers per hour\n= 2,400 / 360\n= 6.666... hours\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an hour in practical terms, we need to round this up to the nearest whole number because the roller coaster can't stop in the middle of an hour. So, the roller coaster needs to operate for 7 hours each day to accommodate all the interested visitors.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. If the roller coaster operates for 7 hours, it can transport:\n\nPassengers in 7 hours = 360 passengers/hour * 7 hours\n= 2,520 passengers\n\nSince 2,520 is greater than 2,400, that seems sufficient. But just to be thorough, let's see how many passengers it could transport in 6 hours:\n\nPassengers in 6 hours = 360 * 6\n= 2,160 passengers\n\n2,160 is less than 2,400, so 6 hours wouldn't be enough. Therefore, 7 hours is indeed the minimum number of hours needed.\n\nAlternatively, if the park is willing to have a wait time, they could operate for 7 hours and have some visitors waiting, but according to the problem, they want to accommodate all interested visitors. So, operating for 7 hours ensures that all 2,400 visitors can ride the roller coaster.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the park is open for longer than 7 hours a day. If the park is open for, say, 10 hours a day, then operating the roller coaster for 7 of those hours would be feasible. But if the park is only open for 6 hours, then it wouldn't be possible to accommodate all visitors without extending the operating hours or increasing the capacity in some way.\n\nBut based on the information given, the main goal is to find out how many hours the roller coaster needs to operate to handle 2,400 passengers, given its capacity and cycle time.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the roller coaster needs to operate for 7 hours daily during peak season to accommodate all interested visitors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
