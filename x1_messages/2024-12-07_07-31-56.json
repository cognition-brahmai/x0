        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 houses in the village, and each house has one dog. So, the number of dogs is 50.\n\nNow, every dog chases three cats. So, for each dog, there are three cats. That means the total number of cats is 50 dogs times 3 cats per dog, which is 150 cats.\n\nEach cat scares away four rats. So, for each cat, there are four rats. That means the total number of rats is 150 cats times 4 rats per cat, which is 600 rats.\n\nNow, to find the total number of animals in the village, we need to add up the number of dogs, cats, and rats.\n\nDogs: 50\n\nCats: 150\n\nRats: 600\n\nTotal animals = 50 + 150 + 600 = 800 animals.\n\nWait a minute, but this seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing? Maybe I should consider if some cats are being chased by more than one dog or if some rats are being scared by more than one cat. But according to the problem, every dog chases three cats, and each cat scares away four rats. It seems like the relationships are set per animal, without overlap in the counting.\n\nSo, I think the total number of animals is 800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
