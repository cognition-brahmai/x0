        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 people in total. Out of these, 18 have cats, 12 have dogs, and 5 have both cats and dogs. I need to find out how many people have neither cats nor dogs.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe some Venn diagrams. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that some people have both cats and dogs. So, those 5 people are included in both the cat and dog counts. Maybe I should start by figuring out how many people have only cats or only dogs.\n\nIf 18 people have cats and 5 of those also have dogs, then the number of people who have only cats is 18 minus 5, which is 13. Similarly, for dogs, 12 people have dogs, and 5 of those also have cats, so the number of people who have only dogs is 12 minus 5, which is 7.\n\nNow, I have:\n\n- Only cats: 13 people\n\n- Only dogs: 7 people\n\n- Both cats and dogs: 5 people\n\nTo find the total number of people who have either cats or dogs or both, I can add these three groups together: 13 + 7 + 5 = 25 people.\n\nSince there are 30 people in total, the number of people who have neither cats nor dogs would be the total number of people minus those who have pets, which is 30 minus 25, equaling 5 people.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I recall there's a formula for this kind of problem. Let's see if I can remember it.\n\nI think it's the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for the number of people who have either cats or dogs is:\n\nNumber of cat owners + number of dog owners - number of people who have both.\n\nSo, that would be 18 + 12 - 5 = 25 people.\n\nThen, again, total people minus those who have pets would be 30 - 25 = 5.\n\nOkay, that matches what I did earlier. So, it seems like 5 people have neither cats nor dogs.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's imagine a Venn diagram. There would be one circle for cat owners and another for dog owners. The overlap between the two circles represents people who have both cats and dogs, which is 5 people.\n\nSo, the part of the cat circle that doesn't overlap with the dog circle would be 18 - 5 = 13, which are cat-only owners. Similarly, the part of the dog circle that doesn't overlap with the cat circle would be 12 - 5 = 7, which are dog-only owners.\n\nAdding up the parts: 13 (cat-only) + 7 (dog-only) + 5 (both) = 25 people have pets.\n\nTotal people are 30, so 30 - 25 = 5 have neither.\n\nI think this makes sense. Maybe there's another way to look at it, just to confirm.\n\nSuppose I consider that everyone has at least a cat or a dog or both. But that's not the case here, since some people might have neither. So, I need to find that number.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of probabilities, but since this is a counting problem, probabilities might not be necessary.\n\nWait, another thought: what if some people have other pets, like birds or fish? But the question is specifically about cats and dogs, so I think we can assume that any pet ownership mentioned is only about cats and dogs.\n\nSo, sticking with the inclusion-exclusion principle, I feel confident that the answer is 5 people have neither cats nor dogs.\n\nLet me just double-check the numbers:\n\n- Total people: 30\n\n- Cat owners: 18\n\n- Dog owners: 12\n\n- Both: 5\n\n- Only cats: 18 - 5 = 13\n\n- Only dogs: 12 - 5 = 7\n\n- Both: 5\n\n- Total pet owners: 13 + 7 + 5 = 25\n\n- Neither: 30 - 25 = 5\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
