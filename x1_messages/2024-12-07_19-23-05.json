        "content": "I'm here to help! So, you want a list of four types of hot sauce, their main ingredients, and how spicy they are in Scoville heat units. Got it. Let's see...\n\nFirst up, we have Tabasco sauce. That's a classic, right? It's made from tabasco peppers, which are a type of chili pepper. The main ingredients include tabasco peppers, vinegar, and salt. As for the heat, Tabasco sauce usually clocks in around 2,500 to 5,000 Scoville heat units (SHU). So, it's pretty spicy but not too extreme.\n\nNext, there's Sriracha. You know, that rooster-shaped bottle? It's super popular in Asian cuisine and beyond. Sriracha is made from chili peppers, garlic, vinegar, sugar, and salt. The heat level varies, but generally, it's around 1,000 to 2,000 SHU. So, it's milder than Tabasco, making it more approachable for those who don't handle too much heat.\n\nMoving on to Frank's RedHot. This one is a favorite in buffalo wings. It's made from a blend of chili peppers, vinegar, salt, and garlic. The heat level is similar to Tabasco, around 1,500 to 2,500 SHU. So, it's spicy but balanced with the other flavors.\n\nLastly, let's talk about harissa. It's a North African chili paste that's gaining popularity worldwide. Harissa is made from a mixture of roasted chili peppers, spices like cumin and coriander, garlic, and often includes olive oil. The heat can vary widely depending on the peppers used, but it's generally around 1,000 to 3,500 SHU.\n\nSo, there you have it: Tabasco, Sriracha, Frank's RedHot, and harissa. Each has its own flavor profile and heat level, so you can choose based on what suits your palate.\n\n**Summary in CSV format:**\n\nType, Primary Ingredients, Scoville Heat Units\n\nTabasco, Tabasco peppers, vinegar, salt, 2,500-5,000 SHU\n\nSriracha, Chili peppers, garlic, vinegar, sugar, salt, 1,000-2,000 SHU\n\nFrank's RedHot, Chili peppers, vinegar, salt, garlic, 1,500-2,500 SHU\n\nHarissa, Roasted chili peppers, spices (cumin, coriander), garlic, olive oil, 1,000-3,500 SHU\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
