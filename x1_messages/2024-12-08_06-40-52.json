        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. The first three terms are given as 2, 5, and 12. I need to find the eighth term. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding the pattern here.\n\nSo, in a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but here the starting terms are different. In the Fibonacci sequence, it usually starts with 0 and 1, or 1 and 1, but here it's 2, 5, and 12.\n\nWait a minute, the first three terms are 2, 5, and 12. So, the third term is 12, which should be the sum of the first and second terms: 2 + 5 = 7. But here it's 12, which is not equal to 7. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, and the first three terms are 2, 5, and 12.\"\n\nHmm, if each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, then the third term should be 2 + 5 = 7, but it's given as 12. So, perhaps the rule applies only starting from the third term onwards, but the first two terms are given arbitrarily as 2 and 5, and the third term is given as 12, maybe to set a different pattern.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the first three terms are 2, 5, and 12.\" So, maybe the rule applies starting from the third term onwards, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.\n\nSo, let's assume that the first two terms are 2 and 5, and the third term is 12, and from the fourth term onwards, each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.\n\nSo, let's list the terms step by step:\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: 5\n\nTerm 3: 12\n\nTerm 4: Term 2 + Term 3 = 5 + 12 = 17\n\nTerm 5: Term 3 + Term 4 = 12 + 17 = 29\n\nTerm 6: Term 4 + Term 5 = 17 + 29 = 46\n\nTerm 7: Term 5 + Term 6 = 29 + 46 = 75\n\nTerm 8: Term 6 + Term 7 = 46 + 75 = 121\n\nSo, the eighth term is 121.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I've applied the rule correctly. The problem says \"each term is the sum of the two preceding terms,\" and it gives the first three terms as 2, 5, and 12.\n\nIf the rule applies to all terms starting from the third term, then Term 3 should be Term 1 + Term 2, which is 2 + 5 = 7, but it's given as 12. So, maybe the rule doesn't apply to the third term, or perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined such that each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, but with some modification.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Suppose the sequence is defined such that from the third term onwards, each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, but with some constant added or multiplied.\n\nFor example, Term 3 = Term 1 + Term 2 + some constant.\n\nBut in the standard definition, it's just the sum of the two preceding terms, without any additional constant.\n\nGiven that Term 1 = 2, Term 2 = 5, Term 3 = 12.\n\nIf Term 3 = Term 1 + Term 2, then it should be 2 + 5 = 7, but it's 12. So, maybe there's a multiplication involved.\n\nLet me check: 2 + 5 = 7, but it's 12. So, 7 * something = 12. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different type of sequence, but the problem specifies that each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first two terms are 2 and 5, and the third term is 12, and the rule applies from the fourth term onwards.\n\nIn that case:\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: 5\n\nTerm 3: 12\n\nTerm 4: Term 2 + Term 3 = 5 + 12 = 17\n\nTerm 5: Term 3 + Term 4 = 12 + 17 = 29\n\nTerm 6: Term 4 + Term 5 = 17 + 29 = 46\n\nTerm 7: Term 5 + Term 6 = 29 + 46 = 75\n\nTerm 8: Term 6 + Term 7 = 46 + 75 = 121\n\nSo, again, I get the eighth term as 121.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each term is the sum of the preceding term and twice the term before that.\n\nFor example, Term 3 = Term 2 + 2 * Term 1 = 5 + 4 = 9, but that's not 12.\n\nWait, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Term 3 = Term 2 + 2 * Term 1 = 5 + 4 = 9, which is still not 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Term 3 = Term 1 + 2 * Term 2 = 2 + 10 = 12. That works.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is Term n = Term (n-1) + 2 * Term (n-2), starting from n=3.\n\nLet me check if that fits the given terms.\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: 5\n\nTerm 3: Term 2 + 2 * Term 1 = 5 + 4 = 9. Wait, but it's given as 12. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's Term n = 2 * Term (n-1) + Term (n-2).\n\nLet's try that:\n\nTerm 3: 2 * Term 2 + Term 1 = 2*5 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12. That matches.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is Term n = 2 * Term (n-1) + Term (n-2), starting from n=3.\n\nLet me verify this with the next term.\n\nTerm 4: 2 * Term 3 + Term 2 = 2*12 + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29\n\nTerm 5: 2 * Term 4 + Term 3 = 2*29 + 12 = 58 + 12 = 70\n\nTerm 6: 2 * Term 5 + Term 4 = 2*70 + 29 = 140 + 29 = 169\n\nTerm 7: 2 * Term 6 + Term 5 = 2*169 + 70 = 338 + 70 = 408\n\nTerm 8: 2 * Term 7 + Term 6 = 2*408 + 169 = 816 + 169 = 985\n\nSo, in this case, the eighth term would be 985.\n\nBut earlier, when I assumed the standard rule of each term being the sum of the two preceding terms starting from the third term, I got the eighth term as 121.\n\nBut according to this new rule, Term n = 2 * Term (n-1) + Term (n-2), the eighth term is 985.\n\nSo, which one is correct? The problem says \"each term is the sum of the two preceding terms,\" which typically means Term n = Term (n-1) + Term (n-2). However, in that case, the third term should be 2 + 5 = 7, but it's given as 12, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different rule at play here, like the one I just considered: Term n = 2 * Term (n-1) + Term (n-2).\n\nGiven that the third term is 12, which is equal to 2*5 + 2, it fits the rule Term n = 2 * Term (n-1) + Term (n-2).\n\nSimilarly, Term 4 = 2*12 + 5 = 29, which seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the rule for this sequence is Term n = 2 * Term (n-1) + Term (n-2), starting from n=3.\n\nTherefore, the eighth term is 985.\n\nBut wait, the problem specifically says \"each term is the sum of the two preceding terms,\" which typically means Term n = Term (n-1) + Term (n-2). However, in this case, that would require Term 3 to be 2 + 5 = 7, but it's given as 12, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement, or maybe the rule is different from the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined differently for the first few terms, and the rule applies only from the third term onwards, with Term 3 being an exception.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, and the first three terms are 2, 5, and 12.\"\n\nThis is confusing because according to the rule, Term 3 should be 7, but it's 12.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo in the problem, and the first three terms are actually something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined such that each term is the sum of the preceding term and twice the term before that, i.e., Term n = Term (n-1) + 2 * Term (n-2).\n\nLet's check:\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: 5\n\nTerm 3: 5 + 2*2 = 5 + 4 = 9. But it's given as 12. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps it's Term n = 3 * Term (n-1) - Term (n-2).\n\nLet's try:\n\nTerm 3: 3*5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13. Not 12.\n\nAlternatively, Term n = Term (n-1) + Term (n-2) + something.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that the problem states \"each term is the sum of the two preceding terms,\" and the first three terms are 2, 5, and 12, which doesn't align with the standard rule, perhaps the rule applies differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, ... which matches the pattern Term n = 2 * Term (n-1) + Term (n-2).\n\nIn this sequence, each term is indeed the sum of the two preceding terms, but with a coefficient of 2 on the preceding term.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention any coefficient. It just says \"the sum of the two preceding terms.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is indeed Term n = Term (n-1) + Term (n-2), but there's an error in the given terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined differently.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to assume that the rule Term n = 2 * Term (n-1) + Term (n-2) applies, since it fits the given terms.\n\nTherefore, the eighth term is 985.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{985} \\]"
