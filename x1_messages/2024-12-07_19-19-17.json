        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 15 meters long and 10 meters wide, and I need to figure out the total length of the fence required, including a gate that's 1 meter wide. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that a rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So, without any gate, the total perimeter would be twice the length plus twice the width. That makes sense. So, perimeter P equals 2 times length plus 2 times width. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 times 15 meters plus 2 times 10 meters. Let me calculate that:\n\n2 * 15 = 30 meters\n\n2 * 10 = 20 meters\n\nSo, total perimeter is 30 + 20 = 50 meters.\n\nBut wait, there's a gate that's 1 meter wide. Does that mean I need to subtract the width of the gate from the total perimeter because the gate will be part of the fence? Or is the gate in addition to the fence? I think the gate is a part of the fence, just a movable section. So, perhaps the total length of the fence is still the same as the perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate is an opening in the fence, so I need to subtract that 1 meter from the total perimeter. Let me think about that. If the gate is 1 meter wide and it's an open space in the fence, then the fence doesn't cover that 1 meter. So, in that case, the total length of the fence would be the perimeter minus 1 meter.\n\nSo, 50 meters minus 1 meter equals 49 meters.\n\nBut, maybe the gate is included in the fence, just with a different material or mechanism. In that case, the total length might still be 50 meters.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again: \"build a fence around it with a gate that is 1 meter wide.\"\n\nI think it means that out of the total perimeter, 1 meter is designated as a gate, which might not require fencing material, or it requires different material, but still, the total length of the fence needed would be the perimeter minus the width of the gate.\n\nSo, 50 meters minus 1 meter equals 49 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is in addition to the perimeter, meaning that the fence has to go around the garden and also include the gate. But that doesn't make much sense because the gate is part of the fence.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If the gate is 1 meter wide, and it's an open passage, then the fence surrounds the garden except for that 1-meter gap for the gate. So, in this case, the total fence length would be the perimeter minus 1 meter.\n\nOn the other hand, if the gate is a structure that needs to be included in the fence length, then maybe it's added to the perimeter. But I don't think that's the case.\n\nI think the most logical approach is to subtract the gate width from the perimeter to get the total fence length needed.\n\nSo, total fence length = perimeter - gate width = 50 meters - 1 meter = 49 meters.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that the gate might have fencing on both sides, but the opening is 1 meter wide. In that case, perhaps the fence length is still the full perimeter.\n\nLet me think about actual fence construction. Typically, a gate is a movable section within the fence, and the fence continues on both sides of the gate. So, the total fence length would still be the full perimeter, and the gate is just a part of it that opens.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total fence length is still 50 meters.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"with a gate that is 1 meter wide,\" which might imply that the gate is an addition to the fence, requiring extra material.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is simply a section of the fence that is removable or movable, but the fencing material is still present on both sides of the gate.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look up a similar problem or think about real-world examples.\n\nThinking about a fence with a gate, usually, the gate hinges are attached to the fence posts or panels, meaning that the fence continues on both sides of the gate.\n\nSo, in that case, the total fence length would be the same as the perimeter, regardless of the gate width.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is suspended between two fence posts without being attached to the fence panels, then maybe the fence length is perimeter minus the gate width.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the definition of perimeter. Perimeter is the total distance around a shape. In this case, the rectangle has a perimeter of 50 meters.\n\nIf I build a fence around it, the fence should cover the entire perimeter, except where the gate is installed.\n\nIf the gate is 1 meter wide, and it's an open passage, then the fence would need to cover the perimeter minus that 1 meter.\n\nTherefore, total fence length is 50 meters minus 1 meter, which is 49 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is considered part of the fence, perhaps the fence length is still 50 meters, including the gate.\n\nBut I think the problem is implying that the gate is an opening in the fence, so the fence surrounds the garden except for the 1-meter-wide gate.\n\nTherefore, total fence length is perimeter minus gate width: 50m - 1m = 49m.\n\nI think that makes the most sense.\n\nSo, the total length of the fence needed is 49 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]"
