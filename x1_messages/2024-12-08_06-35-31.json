        "content": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. There's a bag with 5 white balls, 3 black balls, and 4 red balls. So, total balls in the bag are 5 + 3 + 4, which is 12 balls.\n\nThe problem says I draw one ball at random, replace it in the bag, and then draw another ball. I need to find the probability that I draw exactly one white ball.\n\nOkay, so since I'm replacing the ball after the first draw, the total number of balls remains the same for both draws. That means each draw is independent of the other.\n\nNow, I need to get exactly one white ball in two draws. That means either the first ball is white and the second is not, or the first ball is not white and the second is white.\n\nSo, I can think of this as two separate events:\n\n1. First ball white and second ball not white.\n\n2. First ball not white and second ball white.\n\nAnd since these are independent events, I can calculate the probability of each and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of drawing a white ball in one draw. There are 5 white balls out of 12 total balls, so the probability is 5/12.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of not drawing a white ball is (total balls - white balls)/total balls, which is (12 - 5)/12 = 7/12.\n\nNow, for the first event: first ball white and second ball not white.\n\nThe probability of this event is (probability of first ball white) * (probability of second ball not white), which is (5/12) * (7/12).\n\nSimilarly, for the second event: first ball not white and second ball white.\n\nThe probability of this event is (probability of first ball not white) * (probability of second ball white), which is (7/12) * (5/12).\n\nSince these are two mutually exclusive events, I can add their probabilities to get the total probability of drawing exactly one white ball.\n\nSo, total probability = (5/12)*(7/12) + (7/12)*(5/12).\n\nWait a minute, those two are the same, aren't they? Yeah, because multiplication is commutative, so (5/12)*(7/12) is the same as (7/12)*(5/12).\n\nTherefore, total probability = 2 * (5/12)*(7/12).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, (5/12)*(7/12) = 35/144.\n\nThen, 2 * 35/144 = 70/144.\n\nI can simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2.\n\n70 \u00f7 2 = 35, 144 \u00f7 2 = 72.\n\nSo, 35/72.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly one white ball in two draws with replacement is 35/72.\n\nWait, just to double-check, is there another way to approach this problem?\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of binomial probability, since there are two independent trials and I'm interested in exactly one success, where success is drawing a white ball.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success in a single trial.\n\nIn this case, n=2, k=1, p=5/12.\n\nSo, P(1) = C(2,1) * (5/12)^1 * (7/12)^1.\n\nC(2,1) is 2, so it's 2 * (5/12) * (7/12) = 70/144 = 35/72.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAll right, I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the probability of exactly one white ball is the sum of the probabilities of the sequences where only one ball is white.\n\nThat is, white then not white, or not white then white.\n\nWhich is again (5/12)*(7/12) + (7/12)*(5/12) = 70/144 = 35/72.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, what if I tried to calculate it differently, say, by subtracting the probabilities of other outcomes from 1.\n\nFor example, the probability of exactly one white ball is 1 minus the probability of zero white balls minus the probability of two white balls.\n\nProbability of zero white balls: both balls are not white.\n\nProbability of first ball not white and second ball not white: (7/12)*(7/12) = 49/144.\n\nProbability of two white balls: (5/12)*(5/12) = 25/144.\n\nSo, probability of exactly one white ball = 1 - 49/144 - 25/144 = (144 - 49 - 25)/144 = 70/144 = 35/72.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter how I approach it, I get 35/72.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{35}{72}} \\]"
