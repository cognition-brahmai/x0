        "content": "So, the world population is about 7.9 billion people, and around 60% of them have access to the internet. I need to find out how many people don't have access to the internet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many people do have access to the internet. If 60% of 7.9 billion have internet access, I can calculate that by multiplying 7.9 billion by 60%.\n\nBut, percentages can be a bit tricky, so I'll remember that 60% is the same as 60 per 100, or 0.6 in decimal form. So, to find 60% of 7.9 billion, I can multiply 7.9 billion by 0.6.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber with internet = 7.9 billion \u00d7 0.6\n\nNow, 7.9 billion is the same as 7,900,000,000. So,\n\nNumber with internet = 7,900,000,000 \u00d7 0.6\n\nCalculating that, 7,900,000,000 \u00d7 0.6 = 4,740,000,000.\n\nSo, about 4.74 billion people have access to the internet.\n\nNow, to find out how many don't have access, I can subtract the number with internet from the total population.\n\nNumber without internet = Total population - Number with internet\n\nNumber without internet = 7,900,000,000 - 4,740,000,000\n\nLet's do the subtraction:\n\n7,900,000,000\n\n-4,740,000,000\n\n______________\n\n3,160,000,000\n\nSo, approximately 3.16 billion people don't have access to the internet.\n\nBut, I should check if there's another way to approach this to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way is to think about the percentage that doesn't have internet access. If 60% have access, then 100% - 60% = 40% don't have access.\n\nSo, I can also calculate 40% of 7.9 billion.\n\nAgain, 40% is 0.4 in decimal form.\n\nNumber without internet = 7,900,000,000 \u00d7 0.4\n\nCalculating that, 7,900,000,000 \u00d7 0.4 = 3,160,000,000.\n\nSo, again, approximately 3.16 billion people don't have access to the internet.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of people with and without internet access.\n\nIf 60% have access, then for every 100 people, 60 have access and 40 don't.\n\nSo, in 7.9 billion people, the number without access would be 40% of 7.9 billion, which again is 3.16 billion.\n\nSame answer again, which reinforces that 3.16 billion is the correct number of people without internet access.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like people who have intermittent access or limited access. But based on the information given, it's just a straightforward percentage calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 3.16 billion people don't have access to the internet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.16 \\text{ billion}} \\]"
