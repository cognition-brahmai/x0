        "content": "Certainly! The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2. The numbers which remain unmarked are prime numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n    if limit < 2:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize a boolean array that represents whether each number is prime.\n    # Start with True for all entries, except index 0 and 1, which are not prime.\n    is_prime = [False, False] + [True] * (limit - 1)\n    \n    # Now, process each number starting from 2 up to the square root of the limit.\n    for number in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[number]:\n            # Mark all multiples of the current number as not prime.\n            for multiple in range(number*number, limit + 1, number):\n                is_prime[multiple] = False\n    \n    # Collect all numbers that are still marked as True (prime)\n    primes = [num for num, prime in enumerate(is_prime) if prime]\n    \n    return primes\n\n# Example usage:\nlimit = 30\nprint(f\"Primes up to {limit}: {sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a list `is_prime` of size `limit + 1` and initialize all entries to `True`, except for indices 0 and 1, which are not prime.\n\n2. **Sieve Process**:\n   - Iterate from 2 to the square root of the limit. For each number in this range:\n     - If it is still marked as `True`, it is a prime number.\n     - Mark all multiples of this prime number as `False` starting from its square. This is because smaller multiples would have already been marked by smaller primes.\n\n3. **Collect Primes**:\n   - After processing, collect all indices that are still marked as `True` into a list `primes` and return this list.\n\nThis implementation efficiently finds all primes up to the given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm."
