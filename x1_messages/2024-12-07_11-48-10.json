        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is ((4 - 1) * 6 + 9) / 3. First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n(4 - 1) = 3\n\nNow the expression becomes (3 * 6 + 9) / 3.\n\nNext, I'll do the multiplication within the parentheses:\n\n3 * 6 = 18\n\nSo now it's (18 + 9) / 3.\n\nThen, addition inside the parentheses:\n\n18 + 9 = 27\n\nNow the expression is 27 / 3.\n\nFinally, division:\n\n27 / 3 = 9\n\nSo the answer is 9."
