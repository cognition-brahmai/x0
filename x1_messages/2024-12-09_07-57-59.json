        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 4 doctors and 3 lawyers in a group. Each doctor shakes hands with every lawyer exactly once, but the lawyers don't shake hands with each other. I need to find out how many handshakes occur in total.\n\nFirst, I should understand who is shaking hands with whom. The doctors are shaking hands with the lawyers, but not with each other, and the lawyers are only shaking hands with the doctors, not with each other.\n\nSo, each of the 4 doctors will shake hands with each of the 3 lawyers. That means for each doctor, there are 3 handshakes (one with each lawyer).\n\nSince there are 4 doctors, total handshakes would be 4 doctors times 3 lawyers, which is 12 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that I'm not double-counting any handshakes. Since each handshake is between one doctor and one lawyer, and they are only shaking hands once, 12 seems correct.\n\nLet me think another way. If I consider the lawyers, each lawyer shakes hands with all 4 doctors. So, each lawyer shakes hands 4 times.\n\nThere are 3 lawyers, so 3 lawyers times 4 doctors is also 12 handshakes.\n\nOkay, both approaches give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like there are 12 handshakes in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
