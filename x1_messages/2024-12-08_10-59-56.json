        "content": "In geophysics, the primary method used to study the Earth's interior is B. Seismic wave propagation.\n\nSeismic waves are generated by events such as earthquakes or controlled explosions and travel through the Earth's interior. By studying how these waves propagate, reflect, refract, and attenuate as they pass through different materials, geophysicists can infer the composition, density, and other properties of the Earth's layers.\n\nSatellite imagery (option A) is more commonly used to study the Earth's surface and its gravitational and magnetic fields from space, but it does not provide direct information about the interior.\n\nDirect sampling (option C), such as through drilling, is limited to the Earth's crust and does not provide information about deeper layers.\n\nElectromagnetic field measurements (option D) can provide some information about the Earth's interior, particularly regarding its electrical conductivity, but they are not the primary method for studying the overall structure.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Seismic wave propagation."
