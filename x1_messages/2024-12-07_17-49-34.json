        "content": "Let's see. I need to figure out how much it costs to buy 25 pounds of apples with the given discount tiers. So, the store has different prices depending on how many pounds you buy:\n\n- Up to 10 pounds: $2 per pound\n\n- 11 to 20 pounds: $1.80 per pound\n\n- 21 pounds or more: $1.60 per pound\n\nI want to buy 25 pounds, which falls into the last category, right? So, it should be $1.60 per pound for all 25 pounds. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds:\n\n25 pounds * $1.60 per pound = $40.00\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Like, do I need to calculate the cost differently because the prices change at different intervals? For example, do I need to calculate the cost for the first 10 pounds at $2 each, then the next 10 pounds at $1.80, and the remaining 5 pounds at $1.60?\n\nLet me think about that. The way the pricing is structured, it seems like it's a sliding scale based on the total pounds purchased. So, for 25 pounds, which is in the 21 or more pounds category, the price per pound is $1.60 for all 25 pounds. I don't think I need to break it down into separate intervals.\n\nBut to double-check, let's see what happens if I calculate it the other way. If I were to buy 25 pounds, paying different rates for different portions:\n\n- First 10 pounds: 10 * $2.00 = $20.00\n\n- Next 10 pounds: 10 * $1.80 = $18.00\n\n- Last 5 pounds: 5 * $1.60 = $8.00\n\nTotal cost: $20 + $18 + $8 = $46.00\n\nBut according to the pricing structure, for 21 or more pounds, the rate is $1.60 per pound. So, for 25 pounds, it should be 25 * $1.60 = $40.00.\n\nWhich one is correct? I think the intention is that once you buy 21 pounds or more, you get the $1.60 per pound rate for all 25 pounds. It's a volume discount, meaning the more you buy, the cheaper the price per pound.\n\nSo, the total cost should be 25 * $1.60 = $40.00.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I should look for examples or see if there's any mention of how the pricing works exactly. The problem says \"the price per pound is $2 for up to 10 pounds, $1.80 for 11-20 pounds, and $1.60 for 21 or more pounds.\"\n\nIt seems straightforward. For purchases of 21 pounds or more, the price is $1.60 per pound. So, for 25 pounds, it's $1.60 * 25 = $40.00.\n\nAlternatively, if the pricing was cumulative, meaning you pay $2 per pound for the first 10, $1.80 for the next 10, and $1.60 for any additional pounds after 20, then it would be $2*10 + $1.80*10 + $1.60*5 = $20 + $18 + $8 = $46.00.\n\nBut according to the wording, it's \"the price per pound is\" different amounts based on the total pounds purchased. So, it seems like it's a single rate based on the total quantity.\n\nTherefore, for 25 pounds, it's $1.60 per pound, total $40.00.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40.00} \\]"
