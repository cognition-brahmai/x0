        "content": "Let's see. So, Alice has twice as many apples as Bob. That means if Bob has some number of apples, say, x, then Alice has 2x apples. Makes sense so far.\n\nNow, if Alice gives 6 apples to Bob, they will both have the same number of apples. Okay, so Alice gives away 6 apples, so she loses 6, and Bob gains 6. So, after that, Alice has 2x - 6 apples, and Bob has x + 6 apples. And at that point, they have the same number of apples, right? So, 2x - 6 = x + 6.\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for x. Subtract x from both sides: 2x - x - 6 = x - x + 6 \u2192 x - 6 = 6.\n\nThen, add 6 to both sides: x - 6 + 6 = 6 + 6 \u2192 x = 12.\n\nSo, Bob initially has 12 apples, and Alice has twice that, which is 24 apples.\n\nLet me check that. If Alice has 24 and gives 6 to Bob, she has 18 left. Bob had 12 and receives 6, so he has 18 too. Yeah, that matches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice has 24 apples and Bob has 12 apples initially.}} \\]"
