I need to find out how many windows there are in the whole building. And I have to show my work, which means I should explain step by step how I get to the answer.\n\nAlright, let's start breaking this down. The building has multiple floors, and each floor has multiple rooms, and each room has multiple windows. So, it's like a multiplication of these numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many rooms there are in the entire building. Since there are 20 floors and each floor has 25 rooms, I can multiply the number of floors by the number of rooms per floor to get the total number of rooms.\n\nSo, 20 floors times 25 rooms per floor:\n\n20 \u00d7 25 = 500 rooms.\n\nOkay, so there are 500 rooms in the building.\n\nNext, each room has 4 windows. So, to find the total number of windows, I need to multiply the total number of rooms by the number of windows per room.\n\nThat would be 500 rooms times 4 windows per room:\n\n500 \u00d7 4 = 2000 windows.\n\nSo, there are 2000 windows in the whole building.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm that my answer is correct.\n\nAnother way could be to find out how many windows are there per floor and then multiply by the number of floors.\n\nSo, each floor has 25 rooms, and each room has 4 windows. So, windows per floor would be 25 rooms times 4 windows per room:\n\n25 \u00d7 4 = 100 windows per floor.\n\nNow, with 20 floors, the total number of windows would be 20 floors times 100 windows per floor:\n\n20 \u00d7 100 = 2000 windows.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, that gives me more confidence that 2000 is the correct total number of windows in the building.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using addition instead of multiplication to see if it makes sense.\n\nIf I consider that each floor has 100 windows (as calculated before), then adding up the windows floor by floor for 20 floors should give me the total.\n\nSo, 100 + 100 + 100 + ... and so on, 20 times.\n\nThat would be 100 \u00d7 20, which again is 2000.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire building as one big unit, with 20 floors, each having 25 rooms with 4 windows each, multiplying all these together should give the total number of windows.\n\nSo, 20 floors \u00d7 25 rooms/floor \u00d7 4 windows/room.\n\nMultiplying these together: first, 20 \u00d7 25 = 500, and then 500 \u00d7 4 = 2000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently from different angles.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that some rooms might not have windows or anything like that, but according to the problem, it says each room has 4 windows, so I can assume that all rooms have exactly 4 windows.\n\nAlso, the building has exactly 20 floors, each with exactly 25 rooms, and so on.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any additional information or exceptions to consider.\n\nTherefore, the total number of windows in the building is 2000.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2000} \\]"
