        "content": "Let's see. There's a class of 40 students, and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. I need to find out how many boys and girls there are.\n\nFirst, I know that ratios compare parts. So, the ratio 3:5 means that for every 3 boys, there are 5 girls. That means the total parts are 3 + 5 = 8 parts.\n\nNow, these 8 parts represent the whole class of 40 students. So, each part must represent 40 divided by 8. Let me calculate that: 40 \u00f7 8 = 5. So each part is 5 students.\n\nNow, since there are 3 parts for boys, the number of boys is 3 times 5, which is 15. And for girls, it's 5 parts, so 5 times 5, which is 25.\n\nLet me check if that adds up to 40: 15 + 25 = 40. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, there are 15 boys and 25 girls in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ boys and } 25 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
