        "content": "To solve this linear programming problem, we need to maximize the objective function P = 5x + 3y, given the constraints:\n\n1. x \u2265 0\n\n2. y \u2265 0\n\n3. x + y \u2264 10\n\n4. 2x + y \u2264 12\n\nLinear programming problems are optimization problems where the objective function and the constraints are linear. The feasible region is a convex polygon defined by the constraints, and the optimal solution will always be at one of the vertices of this polygon.\n\n### Step 1: Graph the constraints\n\nFirst, we'll graph each inequality to determine the feasible region.\n\n1. **x \u2265 0**: This represents the right half-plane including the y-axis.\n\n2. **y \u2265 0**: This represents the upper half-plane including the x-axis.\n\n3. **x + y \u2264 10**: To graph this, first find the intercepts.\n\n   - When x = 0, y = 10\n\n   - When y = 0, x = 10\n\n   So, the line is from (0,10) to (10,0). The feasible region is below this line.\n\n4. **2x + y \u2264 12**: Find the intercepts.\n\n   - When x = 0, y = 12\n\n   - When y = 0, x = 6\n\n   So, the line is from (0,12) to (6,0). The feasible region is below this line.\n\n### Step 2: Find the vertices of the feasible region\n\nThe vertices are the points where the boundary lines intersect. We need to find these intersection points.\n\n1. **Intersection of x + y = 10 and 2x + y = 12**\n\n   Subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n   (2x + y) - (x + y) = 12 - 10 \u21d2 x = 2\n\n   Substitute x = 2 into x + y = 10 \u21d2 2 + y = 10 \u21d2 y = 8\n\n   So, the intersection point is (2,8)\n\n2. **Intersection of x + y = 10 and y = 0**\n\n   Substitute y = 0 into x + y = 10 \u21d2 x = 10\n\n   Point: (10,0)\n\n3. **Intersection of 2x + y = 12 and x = 0**\n\n   Substitute x = 0 into 2x + y = 12 \u21d2 y = 12\n\n   Point: (0,12)\n\n4. **Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0**\n\n   Origin: (0,0)\n\n5. **Intersection of 2x + y = 12 and y = 0**\n\n   Substitute y = 0 into 2x + y = 12 \u21d2 2x = 12 \u21d2 x = 6\n\n   Point: (6,0)\n\nNow, we have the vertices: (0,0), (6,0), (2,8), and (0,10)\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the objective function at each vertex\n\nCalculate P = 5x + 3y at each vertex:\n\n1. **At (0,0)**: P = 5(0) + 3(0) = 0\n\n2. **At (6,0)**: P = 5(6) + 3(0) = 30\n\n3. **At (2,8)**: P = 5(2) + 3(8) = 10 + 24 = 34\n\n4. **At (0,10)**: P = 5(0) + 3(10) = 30\n\n### Step 4: Determine the maximum value\n\nComparing the values of P at the vertices:\n\n- 0 at (0,0)\n\n- 30 at (6,0) and (0,10)\n\n- 34 at (2,8)\n\nThe maximum value of P is 34, which occurs at the point (2,8).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{34} \\]"
