        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to figure out how many cycles the roller coaster needs to complete per hour to meet the expected wait time, and then estimate the annual revenue from the ride.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information:\n\n- The ride can accommodate 24 passengers at a time.\n\n- Each cycle takes 3 minutes.\n\n- Expected wait time per passenger during peak hours is 15 minutes.\n\n- The park operates 10 hours a day, 250 days a year.\n\n- Each ride costs $5.\n\nOur goal is to find out:\n\n1. The number of cycles needed per hour to maintain a 15-minute wait time.\n\n2. The annual revenue generated by the ride.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of cycles per hour needed to meet demand.**\n\nTo find out how many cycles are needed per hour, we need to relate the cycle time, the number of passengers per cycle, and the expected wait time.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many passengers can be served per cycle:\n\nPassengers per cycle = 24\n\nTime per cycle = 3 minutes\n\nNow, let's find out how many cycles can be completed in an hour:\n\nMinutes per hour = 60\n\nCycles per hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per cycle = 20 cycles per hour\n\nSo, the ride can theoretically complete 20 cycles per hour.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the wait time is 15 minutes per passenger. To find out if 20 cycles per hour meet this demand, we need to calculate the throughput rate and relate it to the arrival rate of passengers.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \u03bb = arrival rate of passengers (passengers per hour)\n\n- \u03bc = service rate (passengers served per hour)\n\nThe wait time in a queue can be related to the arrival rate and service rate using queueing theory. For a single-server queue (in this case, the roller coaster), the wait time W can be approximated by:\n\nW = 1 / (\u03bc - \u03bb)\n\nGiven that W = 15 minutes per passenger, we need to express this in hours since our other rates are in hours.\n\nW = 15 minutes = 15/60 hours = 0.25 hours\n\nSo,\n\n0.25 = 1 / (\u03bc - \u03bb)\n\nNow, the service rate \u03bc is the number of passengers served per hour. Since each cycle serves 24 passengers and there are 20 cycles per hour:\n\n\u03bc = 24 passengers/cycle * 20 cycles/hour = 480 passengers/hour\n\nPlugging this into the equation:\n\n0.25 = 1 / (480 - \u03bb)\n\nSolving for \u03bb:\n\n1 / 0.25 = 480 - \u03bb\n\n4 = 480 - \u03bb\n\n\u03bb = 480 - 4 = 476 passengers per hour\n\nThis means that to maintain a 15-minute wait time, the arrival rate should not exceed 476 passengers per hour.\n\nBut wait a minute. The park expects an average wait time of 15 minutes per passenger during peak hours, which implies that the arrival rate is such that the wait time is 15 minutes. So, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the wait time is directly related to the number of cycles per hour. Let's think about it differently.\n\nIf the ride completes one cycle every 3 minutes, then in an hour, it can complete 20 cycles, serving 20 * 24 = 480 passengers per hour.\n\nNow, if passengers are arriving at a rate that causes a 15-minute wait, we need to find the arrival rate that corresponds to that wait time.\n\nPerhaps it's better to use the formula for wait time in a queue:\n\nW = (\u03bb)/(\u03bc(\u03bc - \u03bb))\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Maybe I should consider that the wait time is proportional to the number of passengers waiting in line.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the wait time is determined by the number of passengers waiting to ride divided by the throughput rate.\n\nIf the ride is running at a certain number of cycles per hour, serving a certain number of passengers per hour, and passengers are arriving at a certain rate, then the wait time is determined by the balance between the arrival rate and the service rate.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can set up the equation based on the desired wait time.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- C = number of cycles per hour needed to achieve the desired wait time.\n\nThen, the service rate \u03bc = 24 * C passengers per hour.\n\nThe wait time W is inversely proportional to the difference between the service rate and the arrival rate.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know the arrival rate; I only know the desired wait time.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the wait time is the time a passenger spends in the queue before getting on the ride.\n\nIf the ride runs C cycles per hour, each cycle taking 3 minutes, then in one hour, it can serve 24 * C passengers.\n\nIf passengers are arriving at a rate of A passengers per hour, then the wait time W is given by:\n\nW = (A / \u03bc) * (1 / (1 - (A / \u03bc)))\n\nBut this seems too complicated.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to consider that the wait time is proportional to the number of passengers waiting in line.\n\nIf the ride can serve 24 passengers every 3 minutes, then the serving rate is 24 passengers every 3 minutes, or 8 passengers per minute.\n\nWait, 24 passengers every 3 minutes is 24 / 3 = 8 passengers per minute.\n\nNow, if the arrival rate is A passengers per minute, then the wait time W in minutes is:\n\nW = (A / (\u03bc - A))\n\nWhere \u03bc is the serving rate in passengers per minute.\n\nGiven that \u03bc = 8 passengers per minute, and W = 15 minutes, we can solve for A:\n\n15 = (A) / (8 - A)\n\nMultiply both sides by (8 - A):\n\n15 * (8 - A) = A\n\n120 - 15A = A\n\n120 = 16A\n\nA = 120 / 16 = 7.5 passengers per minute\n\nSo, the arrival rate should be 7.5 passengers per minute to have a 15-minute wait time.\n\nNow, to find the number of cycles per hour needed, we need to ensure that the serving rate \u03bc is sufficient to handle the arrival rate A.\n\nWe have \u03bc = 8 passengers per minute, which is 8 * 60 = 480 passengers per hour.\n\nBut with A = 7.5 passengers per minute, which is 7.5 * 60 = 450 passengers per hour.\n\nSo, the serving rate is 480 passengers per hour, and the arrival rate is 450 passengers per hour.\n\nBut wait, earlier we had \u03bc = 480 passengers per hour, and \u03bb = 476 passengers per hour, but now it's 450. There's inconsistency here.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconcile these calculations.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nAssume that the ride runs C cycles per hour.\n\nEach cycle serves 24 passengers, and takes 3 minutes.\n\nSo, in one hour, the ride can serve 20 cycles, as 60 / 3 = 20.\n\nBut we need to find the number of cycles needed to achieve a 15-minute wait time.\n\nLet\u2019s think in terms of the number of passengers in the queue.\n\nAssume that passengers arrive at a constant rate A passengers per hour.\n\nEach cycle serves 24 passengers every 3 minutes, so the serving rate is 24 passengers every 3 minutes, or 8 passengers per minute, as before.\n\nNow, the wait time W is given by the number of passengers in the queue divided by the serving rate.\n\nThe number of passengers in the queue is the arrival rate multiplied by the wait time, since passengers are arriving continuously.\n\nSo, number of passengers in queue = A * W\n\nThen, wait time W = (A * W) / \u03bc\n\nWait, that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system (N) is equal to the arrival rate (A) multiplied by the average time spent in the system (W):\n\nN = A * W\n\nIn a queueing system, the average number of customers in the queue is related to the wait time and the serving rate.\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too complicated.\n\nLet me try to simplify.\n\nIf the ride runs C cycles per hour, it can serve 24 * C passengers per hour.\n\nIf the arrival rate is A passengers per hour, then the wait time W is determined by the balance between A and C.\n\nTo find C such that W = 15 minutes, we can set up the equation based on the relationship between A, C, and W.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider that the wait time is proportional to the number of passengers waiting divided by the serving rate.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- A = arrival rate (passengers per hour)\n\n- C = number of cycles per hour\n\n- S = serving rate = 24 passengers per cycle * C cycles per hour = 24C passengers per hour\n\nThen, the wait time W is given by:\n\nW = (A / S) * T\n\nWhere T is the time per cycle, which is 3 minutes or 0.05 hours.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps W = (A - S) / S * T\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe I need to use the formula for the wait time in a single-server queue, which is W = 1 / (\u03bc - \u03bb), where \u03bc is the serving rate and \u03bb is the arrival rate.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that \u03bc = 24C passengers per hour and \u03bb is the arrival rate, and W = 15 minutes = 0.25 hours, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.25 = 1 / (24C - \u03bb)\n\nBut I have two variables here: C and \u03bb. I need another equation to relate them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the arrival rate \u03bb is such that the system is stable, meaning \u03bb < 24C.\n\nBut without more information, it's tricky.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the park expects an average wait time of 15 minutes, and they have determined that the arrival rate is a certain value based on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of cycles per hour is simply determined by the serving rate needed to match the arrival rate such that the wait time is 15 minutes.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Perhaps I should accept a simpler approximation.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that to maintain a 15-minute wait time, the ride needs to run enough cycles per hour to serve the arriving passengers such that the queue doesn't grow too large.\n\nGiven that the ride can serve 24 passengers every 3 minutes, or 8 passengers per minute, and the wait time is 15 minutes, perhaps the number of passengers in the queue is 8 passengers per minute * 15 minutes = 120 passengers.\n\nThen, to serve these 120 passengers plus the ones arriving during the serving time, we might need to run more cycles.\n\nBut this is getting too involved. Maybe I should consider that the ride needs to run at its maximum capacity of 20 cycles per hour to meet the demand.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed to calculate the annual revenue based on that.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate the annual revenue generated by the ride.**\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The ride operates 10 hours a day.\n\n- The park operates 250 days a year.\n\n- Each ride costs $5.\n\n- The ride can accommodate 24 passengers per cycle.\n\n- Each cycle takes 3 minutes.\n\nFirst, find out how many cycles the ride can complete per day:\n\nCycles per hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per cycle = 20 cycles per hour\n\nCycles per day = 20 cycles/hour * 10 hours/day = 200 cycles/day\n\nNow, find out how many passengers can be served per day:\n\nPassengers per day = 24 passengers/cycle * 200 cycles/day = 4800 passengers/day\n\nNow, find out the daily revenue:\n\nDaily revenue = 4800 passengers/day * $5/passenger = $24,000/day\n\nNow, find out the annual revenue:\n\nAnnual revenue = $24,000/day * 250 days/year = $6,000,000/year\n\nSo, the annual revenue generated by the ride would be $6,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000000} \\]"
