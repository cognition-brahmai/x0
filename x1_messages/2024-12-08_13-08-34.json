        "content": "Certainly! To create a function in JavaScript that checks if all characters in a string are unique, we can use a few different approaches. I'll outline one common method using a Set, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Convert the string to a Set**: A Set automatically removes duplicate characters because it only stores unique values.\n2. **Compare the size of the Set to the length of the string**: If the sizes are equal, all characters are unique; otherwise, there are duplicates.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction areCharactersUnique(str) {\n    const charSet = new Set(str);\n    return charSet.size === str.length;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Creating a Set**: By passing the string `str` to the Set constructor, we create a set of its characters. For example, if `str` is \"abc\", `charSet` will be `{\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}`.\n2. **Comparing Sizes**: If the string has all unique characters, the number of elements in the Set will be equal to the length of the string. If there are duplicates, the Set will have fewer elements.\n\nThis method is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because constructing the Set and accessing its size are both O(n) operations."
