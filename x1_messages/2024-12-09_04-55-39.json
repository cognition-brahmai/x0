        "content": "So I've got this problem here: in a bag of marbles, 3 out of every 5 marbles are red. There are 25 marbles in total, and I need to find out how many are not red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"3 out of every 5 marbles are red\" means. It sounds like a ratio or a fraction. So, for every 5 marbles, 3 are red. That means the remaining marbles in those 5 should be not red. Let's see: 5 minus 3 is 2, so 2 out of every 5 marbles are not red.\n\nNow, there are 25 marbles in total. I need to find out how many are not red. Since I know that 2 out of every 5 marbles are not red, I can set up a proportion or think about how many groups of 5 are in 25.\n\nLet's try the second approach. How many groups of 5 are there in 25? Well, 25 divided by 5 is 5. So, there are 5 groups of 5 marbles in 25.\n\nSince in each group of 5, 2 are not red, then in 5 groups, the number of marbles that are not red would be 5 times 2, which is 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 marbles that are not red.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's think in terms of fractions.\n\nIf 3 out of every 5 marbles are red, that means 3/5 of the marbles are red. Therefore, the fraction of marbles that are not red would be 1 minus 3/5, which is 2/5.\n\nSo, 2/5 of the marbles are not red. Now, if there are 25 marbles in total, then the number of marbles that are not red would be 2/5 times 25.\n\nLet's calculate that: (2/5) * 25 = (2*25)/5 = 50/5 = 10.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier answer. So, there are 10 marbles that are not red.\n\nAlternatively, I could have found out how many marbles are red first and then subtract that from the total to find the number of marbles that are not red.\n\nGiven that 3/5 of the marbles are red, then the number of red marbles is 3/5 * 25 = 15.\n\nSo, total marbles are 25, red marbles are 15, therefore marbles that are not red are 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, I'm confident that 10 is the correct number of marbles that are not red.\n\nLet me just make sure there's no other way to interpret the problem. \"3 out of every 5 marbles are red\" is clear, and the total is 25. No hidden meanings here, I don't think.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the marbles are being drawn without replacement or something like that, but the problem doesn't mention any drawing. It's just about the composition of the bag.\n\nSo, yes, 10 marbles are not red.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
