        "content": "So the problem says that in a city, 1 in every 5 people owns a dog, and the city has a population of 100,000 people. I need to find out how many dogs there are in the city.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"1 in every 5 people owns a dog\" means. Does this mean that for every 5 people, there is one dog owned by one of them? Or does it mean something else? I think it means that one person out of every group of five people owns a dog. So, if I take five people, one of them has a dog.\n\nNow, if I have a population of 100,000 people, I need to find out how many groups of five people there are in this population. To do that, I can divide the total population by 5.\n\nSo, 100,000 divided by 5 is 20,000. That means there are 20,000 groups of five people in the city.\n\nSince in each group of five, one person owns a dog, that means there are 20,000 dogs in the city.\n\nWait a minute, but does this account for people who might own more than one dog? The problem doesn't specify anything about multiple dog ownership, so I'll assume that each dog owner has only one dog.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"owns a dog,\" which typically means one dog per owner, unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the number of dogs in the city is equal to the number of dog owners, which is 20,000.\n\nBut let me double-check this approach. Another way to look at it is to consider the fraction of people who own dogs. If 1 in every 5 people owns a dog, that means 1/5 of the population are dog owners.\n\nSo, to find the number of dog owners, I can multiply the total population by 1/5.\n\n100,000 times 1/5 is also 20,000.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so that gives me more confidence that my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages. If 1 in 5 people owns a dog, that's equivalent to 20% of the population being dog owners.\n\nSo, 20% of 100,000 is also 20,000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI should consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation. For example, are there people who don't own dogs? Yes, according to the ratio, 4 out of every 5 people do not own dogs, so that's consistent.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any restrictions or additional conditions, such as people owning multiple dogs or dogs being owned by businesses rather than individuals. Since no such information is provided, I'll assume that the ratio given applies only to individual dog ownership, with each owner having one dog.\n\nTherefore, the total number of dogs in the city is 20,000.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the ratio could mean something different. For example, could \"1 in every 5 people owns a dog\" mean that for every 5 people, there is one dog, shared among them or something? That seems less likely, as ownership typically implies possession by an individual.\n\nMoreover, the problem specifies \"owns a dog,\" which generally means individual ownership.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use proportions. If 1 in 5 people owns a dog, then the proportion of dog owners is 1/5.\n\nTherefore, in a population of 100,000, the number of dog owners is (1/5) * 100,000 = 20,000.\n\nThis aligns with all the previous methods I've used.\n\nI could also consider using ratios. The ratio of dog owners to total population is 1:5.\n\nSo, if the total population is 100,000, then the number of dog owners is 100,000 divided by 5, which is again 20,000.\n\nEverything points to the same answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's imagine a smaller population. Suppose the city has 10 people. According to the ratio, 1 in every 5 people owns a dog, so 2 people would own dogs in this smaller city.\n\nSimilarly, in a population of 100,000, dividing by 5 gives 20,000 dog owners.\n\nThe scaling seems consistent.\n\nI think I've considered all possible interpretations and methods, and they all lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the number of dogs in the city is 20,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20000} \\]"
