        "content": "Let's see. There are originally 5 apples and 7 oranges in the basket. Tom takes out 3 apples and puts in 4 oranges. So, the number of apples should decrease by 3, and the number of oranges should increase by 4.\n\nStarting with apples: 5 apples - 3 apples = 2 apples left.\n\nOranges: 7 oranges + 4 oranges = 11 oranges.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many apples are left, so the answer should be 2 apples.\n\nWait a minute, is there any trick here? Maybe something about the total number of fruits or something else, but no, the question is straightforward. It's specifically asking for the number of apples left after Tom takes out 3 apples and adds 4 oranges.\n\nSo, initially, 5 apples - 3 apples = 2 apples.\n\nThe oranges go from 7 to 11, but that doesn't affect the number of apples.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2 apples.\n\nI think that's clear. No need to overcomplicate it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
