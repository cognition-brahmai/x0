        "content": "First, I need to figure out how many bricks are needed to build this wall. The wall dimensions are 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 0.75 feet thick. Each brick is 8 inches long, 4 inches high, and 2 inches thick. So, I need to calculate the volume of the wall and the volume of a single brick, then divide the wall volume by the brick volume to find out how many bricks are needed.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that all units are consistent. The wall dimensions are in feet, and the brick dimensions are in inches. I need to convert everything to the same unit. Let's convert the wall dimensions to inches because the bricks are measured in inches.\n\nThere are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n- Length of the wall: 30 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 360 inches\n\n- Height of the wall: 10 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\n\n- Thickness of the wall: 0.75 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 9 inches\n\nNow, the wall is 360 inches long, 120 inches high, and 9 inches thick.\n\nNext, the volume of the wall is length \u00d7 height \u00d7 thickness:\n\nVolume of wall = 360 inches \u00d7 120 inches \u00d7 9 inches = 360 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 9 = 388,800 cubic inches\n\nNow, the volume of one brick is 8 inches \u00d7 4 inches \u00d7 2 inches = 8 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 = 64 cubic inches\n\nTo find the number of bricks needed, I'll divide the volume of the wall by the volume of one brick:\n\nNumber of bricks = Volume of wall / Volume of one brick = 388,800 / 64 = 6,075 bricks\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Maybe I should consider the mortar joints between bricks. In reality, bricks aren't placed directly against each other; there's mortar in between.\n\nAssuming a standard mortar joint of about 0.25 inches, I need to account for that in my calculations.\n\nSo, the effective size of a brick including the mortar is:\n\n- Length: 8 inches + 0.25 inches = 8.25 inches\n\n- Height: 4 inches + 0.25 inches = 4.25 inches\n\n- Thickness: 2 inches + 0.25 inches = 2.25 inches\n\nNow, the volume of one brick including mortar is 8.25 \u00d7 4.25 \u00d7 2.25 cubic inches.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n8.25 \u00d7 4.25 = 35.15625\n\n35.15625 \u00d7 2.25 = 79.140625 cubic inches\n\nNow, the number of bricks needed would be the volume of the wall divided by the volume of one brick with mortar:\n\nNumber of bricks = 388,800 / 79.140625 \u2248 4,912.5 bricks\n\nBut I can't have half a brick, so I need to round up. Maybe it's better to round up to 4,913 bricks.\n\nWait, but this seems lower than my previous calculation, which was 6,075 bricks without considering mortar. That doesn't make sense because including mortar should increase the volume per brick, thus reducing the total number of bricks needed. But in reality, the number of bricks should be higher because of the mortar, not lower.\n\nHold on, I think I made a mistake. The mortar is between bricks, so it's not added to the size of each brick, but rather to the spaces between them.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps I should calculate how many bricks fit in each direction, considering the mortar joints.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of bricks in length:\n\nWall length is 360 inches. Each brick is 8 inches long, with a 0.25-inch mortar joint.\n\nSo, the total length per brick including mortar is 8 + 0.25 = 8.25 inches.\n\nNumber of bricks in length = total length / length per brick = 360 / 8.25 \u2248 43.636\n\nBut I can't have a fraction of a brick, so I'll need to round up to 44 bricks in length.\n\nSimilarly, for height:\n\nWall height is 120 inches. Each brick is 4 inches high, with a 0.25-inch mortar joint.\n\nTotal height per brick including mortar is 4 + 0.25 = 4.25 inches.\n\nNumber of bricks in height = 120 / 4.25 \u2248 28.235\n\nRound up to 29 bricks in height.\n\nFor thickness:\n\nWall thickness is 9 inches. Each brick is 2 inches thick, with a 0.25-inch mortar joint.\n\nTotal thickness per brick including mortar is 2 + 0.25 = 2.25 inches.\n\nNumber of bricks in thickness = 9 / 2.25 = 4 bricks.\n\nNow, the total number of bricks is number in length \u00d7 number in height \u00d7 number in thickness:\n\nTotal bricks = 44 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 4 = 5,256 bricks.\n\nWait, but earlier I got two different numbers: 6,075 without mortar and now 5,256 considering mortar. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the second method is more accurate because it accounts for the mortar joints properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mortar is only between bricks, not on the outer faces.\n\nSo, for length:\n\nNumber of bricks in length = (360 - thickness of one brick - mortar on both ends) / (brick length + mortar)\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look up a standard formula for calculating bricks needed considering mortar joints.\n\nUpon quick research, a common approach is to calculate the number of bricks per square foot.\n\nIn the US, a standard brick size is about 8 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches, and with mortar, it's typically around 8.25 inches by 4.25 inches by 2.25 inches.\n\nThe area covered by one brick with mortar is:\n\nLength \u00d7 height = 8.25 inches \u00d7 4.25 inches = 35.15625 square inches\n\nConvert square inches to square feet:\n\n1 square foot = 144 square inches\n\nSo, area per brick = 35.15625 / 144 \u2248 0.244 square feet\n\nNow, the area of the wall is length \u00d7 height = 360 inches \u00d7 120 inches = 43,200 square inches\n\nConvert to square feet: 43,200 / 144 = 300 square feet\n\nTherefore, number of bricks = total area / area per brick = 300 / 0.244 \u2248 1,229 bricks\n\nWait, that's a huge discrepancy. Earlier I had 6,075 and 5,256, and now only 1,229 bricks.\n\nI must be missing something. Maybe this method doesn't account for the wall thickness.\n\nOh, I see. This method is for a single layer of bricks, but our wall is 9 inches thick.\n\nIf a standard brick is 2 inches thick, then a single brick wall would be 2 inches thick, a double brick wall would be 4 inches, and so on.\n\nOur wall is 9 inches thick, which is equivalent to 9 / 2.25 = 4 courses of bricks, assuming each course is 2.25 inches thick including mortar.\n\nSo, if the single layer method gives 1,229 bricks for a 2.25-inch thick wall, then for a 9-inch thick wall, which is 4 times thicker, I would need 4 times the number of bricks.\n\nTherefore, total bricks = 1,229 \u00d7 4 \u2248 4,916 bricks\n\nThis is similar to my earlier calculation of 5,256 bricks using the other method.\n\nPerhaps I can take an average of these two estimates: (4,916 + 5,256) / 2 \u2248 5,086 bricks\n\nAlternatively, I can try calculating the volume including mortar more accurately.\n\nLet's calculate the volume of one brick with mortar:\n\nSize with mortar: 8.25 inches \u00d7 4.25 inches \u00d7 2.25 inches\n\nVolume = 8.25 \u00d7 4.25 \u00d7 2.25 = 79.140625 cubic inches\n\nTotal volume of the wall is 360 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 9 = 388,800 cubic inches\n\nNumber of bricks = total volume / volume per brick = 388,800 / 79.140625 \u2248 4,912 bricks\n\nThis is close to the earlier estimate of 4,916 bricks.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that approximately 4,912 bricks are needed to build the wall, considering mortar joints.\n\nBut in practice, it's always better to have extra bricks for breakages, adjustments, and mistakes. Maybe add 10% extra:\n\nExtra bricks = 4,912 \u00d7 0.10 \u2248 491 bricks\n\nTotal bricks needed = 4,912 + 491 \u2248 5,403 bricks\n\nSo, approximately 5,403 bricks are needed to build the wall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5403} \\]"
