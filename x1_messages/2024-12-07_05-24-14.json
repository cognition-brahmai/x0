        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 800 students, and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. We need to find out how many more girls there are than boys.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio like 3:5 tells us that for every 3 boys, there are 5 girls. That means the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 5 = 8 parts.\n\nNow, since the total number of students is 800, each part of the ratio should represent an equal portion of these 800 students. So, to find out how many students each part represents, I can divide the total number of students by the total number of parts:\n\nNumber of students per part = Total students / Total parts\n                                      = 800 / 8\n                                      = 100\n\nAlright, so each part represents 100 students.\n\nNow, since there are 3 parts for boys, the number of boys is:\n\nNumber of boys = 3 parts * 100 students per part\n                          = 300 students\n\nSimilarly, for girls, who have 5 parts:\n\nNumber of girls = 5 parts * 100 students per part\n                           = 500 students\n\nNow, to find out how many more girls there are than boys, I just need to subtract the number of boys from the number of girls:\n\nMore girls = Number of girls - Number of boys\n                  = 500 - 300\n                  = 200\n\nSo, there are 200 more girls than boys in the school.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The ratio is 3:5, and the total is 800 students. The sum of the ratio parts is 8, and 800 divided by 8 is indeed 100. Then, 3 parts for boys is 300, and 5 parts for girls is 500. The difference is 200. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of fractions. Since the total parts are 8, boys make up 3/8 of the student body, and girls make up 5/8.\n\nSo, number of boys = (3/8) * 800 = 300\n\nNumber of girls = (5/8) * 800 = 500\n\nAgain, the difference is 200.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up equations. Let\u2019s say the number of boys is 3x and the number of girls is 5x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nThen, 3x + 5x = 800\n\n8x = 800\n\nx = 100\n\nSo, boys = 3 * 100 = 300\n\nGirls = 5 * 100 = 500\n\nDifference = 500 - 300 = 200\n\nNo matter how I look at it, the answer is 200 more girls than boys.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Ratios can be tricky sometimes, but breaking it down into parts makes it easier to understand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
