Currently, the hospital has 10 ambulances, each capable of responding to an average of 5 emergencies per day. The hospital's goal is to increase the daily response capacity by 30%. Calculate the number of additional ambulances required, considering each ambulance costs $150,000 and has an annual maintenance cost of $20,000."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the hospital currently has 10 ambulances, and each can handle an average of 5 emergencies per day. That means the total number of emergencies they can respond to daily is 10 ambulances times 5 emergencies per ambulance, which is 50 emergencies per day.\n\nNow, the hospital wants to increase this daily response capacity by 30%. To find out what 30% of 50 is, I can calculate 0.30 times 50, which equals 15. So, they want to increase their capacity by 15 emergencies per day. That means their new total capacity should be 50 plus 15, which is 65 emergencies per day.\n\nEach additional ambulance can handle 5 emergencies per day, just like the existing ones. So, to find out how many additional ambulances are needed to handle those extra 15 emergencies, I can divide the additional emergencies by the number of emergencies per ambulance. That's 15 divided by 5, which equals 3. So, they need 3 additional ambulances.\n\nBut let's double-check that. If they add 3 ambulances, each handling 5 emergencies per day, that's an additional 15 emergencies per day, which matches the increase they're seeking. Perfect.\n\nNow, regarding the cost. Each additional ambulance costs $150,000, and there's an annual maintenance cost of $20,000 per ambulance. So, for 3 additional ambulances, the initial purchase cost would be 3 times $150,000, which is $450,000. The annual maintenance for these 3 ambulances would be 3 times $20,000, which is $60,000 per year.\n\nIt's important for the hospital to consider both the initial investment and the ongoing maintenance costs when planning this expansion. They should also factor in any potential revenue from handling more emergencies, as well as the improved service and potentially better patient outcomes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's something else to consider. For example, do they have the infrastructure to accommodate more ambulances, like parking space, maintenance facilities, and staffing? Adding more ambulances might require hiring and training additional paramedics and drivers, which is another cost they need to account for.\n\nAlso, is there enough demand for an additional 15 emergencies per day? They should analyze their current demand and forecast future needs to ensure that adding these ambulances makes sense in the context of their community's health care needs.\n\nMoreover, perhaps there are more efficient ways to increase response capacity without necessarily adding more ambulances. For instance, optimizing routes, improving dispatch systems, or enhancing the capabilities of existing staff could help increase efficiency. However, if the hospital has already considered these options and determined that adding ambulances is the most effective solution, then proceeding with the purchase makes sense.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the lifespan of the ambulances. Assuming they have a useful life of, say, 10 years, the total cost over their lifetime would include the initial purchase plus 10 years of maintenance. So, for 3 ambulances, that would be $450,000 initial cost plus $60,000 per year times 10 years, which is $600,000, totaling $1,050,000 over 10 years.\n\nComparing this to the benefits, such as improved patient care, potential increase in patient volume, and possibly enhanced reputation, the hospital can decide if this is a worthwhile investment.\n\nAdditionally, they might want to explore financing options or leasing the ambulances, which could spread out the costs over time.\n\nIn conclusion, the hospital needs to add 3 ambulances to meet their increased response capacity goal. The initial cost is $450,000, with an annual maintenance cost of $60,000, leading to a total cost of $1,050,000 over 10 years. They should also consider other factors such as infrastructure, staffing, and alternative efficiency improvements before making the final decision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
