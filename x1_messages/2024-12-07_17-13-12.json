        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train going from Town A to Town B at a constant speed, and halfway through the journey, it starts raining, causing the train to reduce its speed by 25%. Because of this, the entire trip takes 20% longer than originally planned. We need to find out what percentage of the journey was completed before it started raining.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the total distance between Town A and Town B is D kilometers. The original speed of the train is S kilometers per hour. Therefore, the original time planned for the trip is T = D / S hours.\n\nNow, according to the problem, halfway through the journey, it starts raining, and the train reduces its speed by 25%. So, the speed after it starts raining is S - 0.25S = 0.75S kilometers per hour.\n\nBut wait a minute, the problem says \"halfway through the journey,\" but it might not necessarily mean exactly half the distance. It could be that a certain percentage of the journey was completed before it started raining, and we need to find that percentage. So, maybe we should let x be the percentage of the journey completed before it started raining. Then, the distance covered before it started raining is (x/100)*D, and the distance remaining after it starts raining is D - (x/100)*D = D*(1 - x/100).\n\nThe time taken before it starts raining is [(x/100)*D] / S.\n\nAfter it starts raining, the speed reduces to 0.75S, so the time taken for the remaining distance is [D*(1 - x/100)] / (0.75S).\n\nThe total time taken for the trip is then:\n\nT_total = [(x/100)*D / S] + [D*(1 - x/100) / (0.75S)]\n\nBut we know that the entire trip takes 20% longer than originally planned. The original time planned was T = D / S. So, 20% longer than that would be T_total = T + 0.2T = 1.2T = 1.2*(D / S).\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n[(x/100)*D / S] + [D*(1 - x/100) / (0.75S)] = 1.2*(D / S)\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation. First, let's factor out D/S from each term:\n\nD/S * [x/100 + (1 - x/100)/0.75] = 1.2*(D/S)\n\nNow, we can cancel out D/S from both sides:\n\nx/100 + (1 - x/100)/0.75 = 1.2\n\nLet's simplify the second term:\n\n(1 - x/100)/0.75 = (1 - x/100) * 4/3 = (4/3)*(1 - x/100)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx/100 + (4/3)*(1 - x/100) = 1.2\n\nLet's distribute the 4/3:\n\nx/100 + 4/3 - (4/3)*(x/100) = 1.2\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nx/100 - (4/3)*(x/100) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nFactor out x/100:\n\nx/100*(1 - 4/3) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nWhich is:\n\nx/100*(-1/3) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nNow, let's isolate x/100:\n\nx/100*(-1/3) = 1.2 - 4/3\n\nFirst, compute 1.2 - 4/3:\n\n1.2 is 6/5, and 4/3 is 4/3, so:\n\n6/5 - 4/3 = (18 - 20)/15 = -2/15\n\nSo:\n\nx/100*(-1/3) = -2/15\n\nNow, multiply both sides by -3:\n\nx/100 = (-2/15)*(-3) = 6/15 = 2/5\n\nSo, x/100 = 2/5\n\nTherefore, x = (2/5)*100 = 40%\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"halfway through the journey,\" so maybe I misinterpreted that. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"halfway through the journey\" means exactly half the distance, and we need to find out what percentage of the total time was spent before it started raining.\n\nBut no, the problem asks for the percentage of the journey completed before it started raining, which I think is what I calculated as x%.\n\nBut according to my calculation, x = 40%. But let's double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from:\n\nx/100 + (4/3)*(1 - x/100) = 1.2\n\nThen:\n\nx/100 - (4/3)*(x/100) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nWhich is:\n\nx/100*(1 - 4/3) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nThat is:\n\nx/100*(-1/3) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nThen:\n\nx/100 = (-2/15)/(-1/3) = (-2/15)*(-3/1) = 6/15 = 2/5 = 0.4 => x = 40%\n\nSeems correct. So, 40% of the journey was completed before it started raining.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"halfway through the journey,\" which is 50%. According to my calculation, it's 40%. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"halfway through the journey\" refers to time instead of distance. Let me consider that.\n\nIf \"halfway through the journey\" means half the original time, not half the distance, then let's adjust the approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that halfway through the original time, it starts raining. So, for the first half of the original time, the train travels at speed S, and then for the remaining half of the original time, it travels at 0.75S.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the total distance covered in this scenario.\n\nDistance covered in the first half time: S * (T/2)\n\nDistance covered in the second half time at reduced speed: 0.75S * (T/2)\n\nTotal distance: S*(T/2) + 0.75S*(T/2) = (S + 0.75S)*(T/2) = (1.75S)*(T/2) = 0.875*S*T\n\nBut the actual distance is D = S*T, so 0.875*S*T is less than D, which doesn't make sense because the trip should cover the entire distance D.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption is incorrect. Maybe \"halfway through the journey\" refers to distance, not time.\n\nLet me go back to the initial approach.\n\nAssume the journey is divided into two parts: before and after it starts raining.\n\nLet\u2019s say the train travels a distance of k*D before it starts raining, where k is the fraction of the journey completed before it starts raining. So, the remaining distance is (1 - k)*D.\n\nThe speed before raining is S, and after raining, it's 0.75S.\n\nThe time taken before raining: k*D / S\n\nThe time taken after raining: (1 - k)*D / (0.75S)\n\nTotal time: k*D/S + (1 - k)*D/(0.75S) = D/S [k + (1 - k)/0.75]\n\nThis total time is 20% longer than the original time D/S, so:\n\nD/S [k + (1 - k)/0.75] = 1.2*(D/S)\n\nWe can cancel D/S from both sides:\n\nk + (1 - k)/0.75 = 1.2\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nLet\u2019s compute (1 - k)/0.75:\n\n(1 - k)/0.75 = (1 - k)*4/3\n\nSo:\n\nk + (1 - k)*4/3 = 1.2\n\nNow, distribute 4/3:\n\nk + 4/3 - (4/3)k = 1.2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk - (4/3)k + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nWhich is:\n\n-(1/3)k + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nNow, subtract 4/3 from both sides:\n\n-(1/3)k = 1.2 - 4/3\n\nCompute 1.2 - 4/3:\n\n1.2 is 6/5, 4/3 is 4/3, so 6/5 - 4/3 = (18 - 20)/15 = -2/15\n\nSo:\n\n-(1/3)k = -2/15\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n(1/3)k = 2/15\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 3:\n\nk = (2/15)*3 = 2/5 = 0.4\n\nSo, k = 0.4, which is 40%.\n\nTherefore, 40% of the journey was completed before it started raining.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"halfway through the journey,\" which might be confusing. Maybe it's better to interpret it as the point where it starts raining is at 50% distance, and then the speed reduces, leading to the total time being 20% longer. But according to the calculation, it's 40%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"halfway through the journey\" is in terms of time, not distance.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSuppose that halfway through the original time T, it starts raining, meaning at time T/2, the speed reduces by 25%.\n\nThen, the distance covered in the first half time is S*(T/2).\n\nThe distance covered in the second half time at reduced speed is 0.75S*(T/2).\n\nTotal distance: S*(T/2) + 0.75S*(T/2) = (S + 0.75S)*(T/2) = 1.75S*(T/2) = 0.875*S*T\n\nBut the actual distance is D = S*T, so 0.875*S*T is less than D, which doesn't make sense because the train should cover the entire distance.\n\nThis suggests that the interpretation of \"halfway through the journey\" as half the original time is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps \"halfway through the journey\" means that the train has covered half the distance when it starts raining.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the train has covered half the distance, D/2, at speed S, and then the remaining D/2 at speed 0.75S.\n\nThe time taken for the first half is (D/2)/S = D/(2S)\n\nThe time taken for the second half is (D/2)/(0.75S) = (D/2)/(3S/4) = (D/2)*(4)/(3S) = (2D)/(3S)\n\nTotal time: D/(2S) + 2D/(3S) = (3D + 4D)/(6S) = 7D/(6S)\n\nThe original time planned was T = D/S\n\nThe actual time is 7D/(6S) = (7/6)T, which is approximately 116.67% of the original time, meaning 16.67% longer, not 20% longer.\n\nBut the problem states that the entire trip takes 20% longer than originally planned. So, this contradicts the assumption that \"halfway through the journey\" means half the distance.\n\nTherefore, \"halfway through the journey\" cannot mean half the distance, because in that case, the trip would be 16.67% longer, not 20%.\n\nPerhaps \"halfway through the journey\" means that the train has covered a certain percentage of the journey, and we need to find that percentage such that the total trip is 20% longer.\n\nLet\u2019s denote by p the percentage of the journey completed before it starts raining. So, the distance covered before raining is (p/100)*D, and the remaining distance is D - (p/100)*D = D*(1 - p/100).\n\nThe time taken before raining is [(p/100)*D]/S = (p*D)/(100*S)\n\nThe time taken after raining is [D*(1 - p/100)]/(0.75*S) = [D*(1 - p/100)]/(0.75*S)\n\nTotal time: (p*D)/(100*S) + [D*(1 - p/100)]/(0.75*S)\n\nThis total time is 1.2*(D/S)\n\nSo:\n\n(p*D)/(100*S) + [D*(1 - p/100)]/(0.75*S) = 1.2*(D/S)\n\nWe can divide both sides by D/S:\n\n(p/100) + (1 - p/100)/0.75 = 1.2\n\nLet\u2019s simplify:\n\np/100 + (1 - p/100)/0.75 = 1.2\n\nLet\u2019s compute (1 - p/100)/0.75:\n\n(1 - p/100)/0.75 = (1 - p/100)*4/3\n\nSo:\n\np/100 + (4/3)*(1 - p/100) = 1.2\n\nExpand the second term:\n\np/100 + 4/3 - (4/3)*(p/100) = 1.2\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\np/100 - (4/3)*(p/100) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nFactor p/100:\n\np/100*(1 - 4/3) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nWhich is:\n\np/100*(-1/3) + 4/3 = 1.2\n\nNow, isolate p/100:\n\np/100*(-1/3) = 1.2 - 4/3\n\nCompute 1.2 - 4/3:\n\n1.2 is 6/5, 4/3 is 4/3, so 6/5 - 4/3 = (18 - 20)/15 = -2/15\n\nTherefore:\n\np/100*(-1/3) = -2/15\n\nMultiply both sides by -3:\n\np/100 = (-2/15)*(-3) = 6/15 = 2/5 = 0.4\n\nSo, p = 0.4*100 = 40%\n\nTherefore, 40% of the journey was completed before it started raining.\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier calculation. The initial confusion might have arisen from misinterpreting \"halfway through the journey,\" but the problem might have been using \"halfway\" in a different sense, perhaps as a reference point rather than the actual point where the rain starts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to the problem that could confirm this result.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the ratio of speeds before and after it starts raining. The speed decreases by 25%, so the new speed is 75% of the original speed. Therefore, the time taken after it starts raining increases by 1/0.75 = 4/3 or approximately 33.33%.\n\nIf the entire trip takes 20% longer than planned, that means the additional time due to raining accounts for 20% of the original time.\n\nLet\u2019s denote t1 as the time spent before it starts raining, and t2 as the time spent after it starts raining.\n\nWe have:\n\nt1 + t2 = 1.2*T\n\nBut t1 is the time to cover distance d1 at speed S, so d1 = S*t1\n\nt2 is the time to cover distance d2 at speed 0.75S, so d2 = 0.75S*t2\n\nBut the total distance D = d1 + d2 = S*t1 + 0.75S*t2 = S*(t1 + 0.75*t2)\n\nBut D = S*T, so:\n\nS*(t1 + 0.75*t2) = S*T => t1 + 0.75*t2 = T\n\nBut we also have t1 + t2 = 1.2*T\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) t1 + 0.75*t2 = T\n\n2) t1 + t2 = 1.2*T\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(t1 + t2) - (t1 + 0.75*t2) = 1.2*T - T => 0.25*t2 = 0.2*T => t2 = (0.2*T)/(0.25) = 0.8*T\n\nNow, plug t2 back into equation 2:\n\nt1 + 0.8*T = 1.2*T => t1 = 1.2*T - 0.8*T = 0.4*T\n\nSo, t1 = 0.4*T\n\nNow, the distance covered before it starts raining is d1 = S*t1 = S*0.4*T\n\nBut D = S*T, so d1/D = 0.4 or 40%\n\nTherefore, 40% of the journey was completed before it started raining.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
