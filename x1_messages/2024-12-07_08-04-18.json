        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 students in the class, and each student has to shake hands with every other student exactly once. I need to find out how many handshakes there will be in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this problem is asking. It's about counting the number of unique handshakes when each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. So, no student shakes hands with the same student more than once, and no student shakes hands with themselves.\n\nI think this is a problem related to combinations. In combinations, the order doesn't matter, which is perfect for handshakes because shaking hands is a mutual action. So, the handshake between student A and student B is the same as the handshake between student B and student A; it's just one handshake.\n\nSo, the formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. In this case, \\( n = 12 \\) (the number of students), and \\( k = 2 \\) because a handshake involves two students.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can simplify this. Since \\( 12! = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10! \\), the \\( 10! \\) cancels out:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2! \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there should be 66 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. So, the first student shakes hands with 11 other students, the second student shakes hands with 10 remaining students (since they've already shaken hands with the first student), the third student shakes hands with 9 remaining students, and so on, until the last student, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n\\[\n11 + 10 + 9 + \\dots + 1\n\\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a = 11 \\), the last term \\( l = 1 \\), and the number of terms \\( n = 11 \\).\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{11}{2} \\times (11 + 1) = \\frac{11}{2} \\times 12 = 11 \\times 6 = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, again, the total number of handshakes is 66.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it using graphs. If each student is represented as a node in a graph, and each handshake as an edge connecting two nodes, then the problem reduces to finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 12 nodes.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with \\( n \\) nodes is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\( n = 12 \\):\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nOnce again, the answer is 66.\n\nI think this confirms that the total number of handshakes is indeed 66.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
