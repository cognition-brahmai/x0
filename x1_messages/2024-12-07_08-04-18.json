        "content": "So there's this party where some people speak English, some speak French, and some speak both. I need to figure out how many people speak only English or only French. Let's see.\n\nFirst, there are 10 people who speak English. Out of these, 6 speak both English and French. So, the number of people who speak only English should be the total English speakers minus those who speak both languages. That would be 10 minus 6, which is 4 people.\n\nNext, there are 7 people who speak French, and among them, 6 speak both English and French. So, the number of people who speak only French should be the total French speakers minus those who speak both languages. That would be 7 minus 6, which is 1 person.\n\nNow, to find out how many people speak only English or only French, I need to add the number of only English speakers and only French speakers together. So, 4 plus 1 equals 5 people.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember there's something called the inclusion-exclusion principle in set theory. Let me recall that. The principle states that for two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. In formula terms, it's |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nIn this problem, set A could be the English speakers, and set B could be the French speakers. So, the total number of people who speak either English or French or both would be 10 + 7 - 6, which is 11 people.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of people who speak only English or only French. So, that would be the total number of people who speak English or French minus the number of people who speak both languages.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the total number of people who speak only English or only French should be the total number who speak English or French minus those who speak both, because those who speak both are included in both the English and French counts.\n\nBut hold on, I already calculated the only English speakers as 4 and only French speakers as 1, totaling 5.\n\nBut according to the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of people who speak English or French is 11, and since 6 speak both, the number of people who speak only English or only French would be 11 - 6 = 5, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5 people.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that someone speaks only English or only French beyond what's been accounted for? The numbers seem straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the party has more people who don't speak either language, but the question doesn't provide that information, so I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"only English or only French,\" so anyone who speaks both languages shouldn't be included in this count.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
