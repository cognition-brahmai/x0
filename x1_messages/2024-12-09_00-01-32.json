        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains leaving the same station but at different times and going in opposite directions. The first train leaves at 9 AM going east at 60 mph, and the second train leaves at 11 AM going west at 80 mph. We need to find out when they will be 420 miles apart.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how far each train has traveled by any given time. Since they're going in opposite directions, the distance between them will be the sum of the distances each has traveled.\n\nLet's denote the time after 11 AM as t hours. So, at time t after 11 AM:\n\n- The first train has been traveling for t + 2 hours (since it left at 9 AM, which is 2 hours before 11 AM).\n\n- The second train has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance traveled by the first train is 60 mph * (t + 2) hours.\n\nThe distance traveled by the second train is 80 mph * t hours.\n\nSince they're going in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of these distances:\n\nDistance = 60(t + 2) + 80t\n\nWe want this distance to be 420 miles:\n\n60(t + 2) + 80t = 420\n\nNow, let's solve for t.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n60t + 120 + 80t = 420\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t + 120 = 420\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides:\n\n140t = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 140:\n\nt = 300 / 140\n\nSimplify:\n\nt = 15/7 hours\n\nWhich is approximately 2 hours and 8.57 minutes.\n\nSo, t is approximately 2.143 hours after 11 AM.\n\nTo find the exact time, we can convert 15/7 hours into hours and minutes.\n\n15/7 hours = 2 hours + (1/7) hours.\n\nSince 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1/7 hours is (60/7) minutes, which is approximately 8.57 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the time after 11 AM is approximately 2 hours and 8.57 minutes.\n\nSo, adding this to 11 AM:\n\n11:00 AM + 2 hours = 1:00 PM\n\nPlus 8.57 minutes: approximately 1:08:34 PM.\n\nBut let's check if this is accurate.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should find the exact time without approximation.\n\nWe have t = 15/7 hours after 11 AM.\n\nLet's convert 15/7 hours into hours and minutes exactly.\n\n15/7 hours = 2 hours + 1/7 hours.\n\nNow, 1/7 hours is exactly 60/7 minutes, which is 8 minutes + (4/7) minutes.\n\nSince 4/7 minutes is (4/7)*60 seconds = 34.2857... seconds.\n\nSo, approximately, it's 1:08:34 PM.\n\nBut perhaps we can leave it in fractional form for more precision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me double-check the initial setup.\n\nThe first train leaves at 9 AM at 60 mph.\n\nThe second train leaves at 11 AM at 80 mph, going west.\n\nWe want the time when the distance between them is 420 miles.\n\nFrom 9 AM to 11 AM, the first train is already moving for 2 hours.\n\nIn those 2 hours, it covers 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nSo, at 11 AM, the first train is already 120 miles east of the station.\n\nThen, after 11 AM, both trains are moving: the first continues east at 60 mph, and the second moves west at 80 mph.\n\nSo, from 11 AM onwards, the distance between them increases at a rate of 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nBecause they're moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.\n\nSo, the distance between them increases by 140 miles every hour after 11 AM.\n\nBut at 11 AM, the initial distance is already 120 miles.\n\nWe want the total distance to be 420 miles.\n\nSo, the additional distance needed is 420 - 120 = 300 miles.\n\nAt 140 mph, the time required to cover 300 miles is t = 300 / 140 hours = 15/7 hours, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the time after 11 AM is 15/7 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time from 9 AM is 2 hours (from 9 AM to 11 AM) plus 15/7 hours.\n\nBut actually, since we're asked when they will be 420 miles apart, and we've calculated that it's 15/7 hours after 11 AM, we can find the exact time.\n\n15/7 hours is exactly 2 hours and 1/7 hours.\n\n1/7 hours is exactly 60/7 minutes, which is approximately 8.5714 minutes.\n\nSo, the time is 11:00 AM plus 2 hours and 8.5714 minutes, which is approximately 1:08:34 PM.\n\nAlternatively, to be exact, it's 1:08:34.2857... PM.\n\nBut perhaps the expected answer is in terms of hours and minutes, with seconds if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in fractional hours.\n\nBut typically, times are given in hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nSo, 1:08:34 PM would be the approximate time when they are 420 miles apart.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first train has a head start and calculate the distance covered by each train until their combined distances equal 420 miles.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of relative speed.\n\nSince they're moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nBut, the first train has a 2-hour head start, covering 120 miles.\n\nSo, from 11 AM onwards, the distance between them increases at 140 mph from an initial 120 miles.\n\nSo, the total distance at time t after 11 AM is 120 + 140t miles.\n\nSet this equal to 420 miles:\n\n120 + 140t = 420\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides:\n\n140t = 300\n\nDivide by 140:\n\nt = 300 / 140 = 15/7 hours, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, the time after 11 AM is 15/7 hours.\n\nTherefore, the exact time is 11:00 AM plus 2 hours and 1/7 hours.\n\nWhich is 1:00 PM plus 1/7 hours.\n\n1/7 hours is approximately 8.5714 minutes, so roughly 1:08:34 PM.\n\nAlternatively, to be exact, 1:08:34.2857... PM.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to express this time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the exact time by adding 15/7 hours to 11:00 AM.\n\nFirst, convert 15/7 hours to hours and minutes.\n\n15/7 hours = 2 hours + 1/7 hours.\n\n1/7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 60/7 minutes \u2248 8.5714 minutes.\n\nSo, 11:00 AM + 2 hours = 1:00 PM.\n\nThen, 1:00 PM + 8.5714 minutes = 1:08:34 PM.\n\nTherefore, the trains will be 420 miles apart at approximately 1:08:34 PM.\n\nAlternatively, if more precision is needed, it's 1:08:34.2857... PM.\n\nBut for practical purposes, 1:08:34 PM is sufficient.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 1:08:34 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1:08:34 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
