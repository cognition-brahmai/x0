        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a water tank. The tank can hold up to 800 liters, but right now it has 500 liters in it. There's a tap that's letting water out at a rate of 10 liters per minute. I need to figure out how long it will take for the tank to be completely empty.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I need to find the time it takes for the tank to go from 500 liters to 0 liters, with water being released at a constant rate of 10 liters per minute.\n\nOkay, so the tank is being drained at a steady rate. That means I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Amount to be drained / Drain rate\n\nIn this case, the amount to be drained is the current volume of water in the tank, which is 500 liters, and the drain rate is 10 liters per minute.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 500 liters / 10 liters per minute\n\nThat gives:\n\nTime = 50 minutes\n\nWait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's anything else I need to consider.\n\nLet me think: The tank has a capacity of 800 liters, but since it's only filled with 500 liters, I don't need to worry about the full capacity for this problem. I'm just concerned with how long it takes to drain what's currently in the tank.\n\nAlso, the drain rate is constant at 10 liters per minute, so there aren't any variables changing over time.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the draining time. For example, does the water pressure change as the tank empties? In real-world scenarios, the pressure might decrease as the water level drops, which could affect the drain rate. However, in this problem, it's specified that the tap releases water at a constant rate of 10 liters per minute, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. The rate is given in liters per minute, and the volume is in liters, which is consistent, so that's good.\n\nAlso, ensure that the tank doesn't have any inflow of water while it's being drained. The problem states that the tap is releasing water, but doesn't mention any inflow, so I can assume that the only change in volume is due to the outflow.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any initial or final condition that might affect the time calculation. For instance, does the tap take some time to open or close? The problem doesn't specify any such details, so I can assume that the draining starts and stops instantly.\n\nMoreover, perhaps there's a need to consider the tank's shape or the way water flows out, but again, the problem gives a constant drain rate, so those factors aren't necessary for this calculation.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The calculation is straightforward: time equals volume divided by rate.\n\nSo, the tank will be completely empty in 50 minutes.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should present the answer in different units or consider significant figures.\n\nThe rate is given to two significant figures (10 liters per minute), and the volume is also given to two significant figures (500 liters). Therefore, the answer should also be reported to two significant figures.\n\n50 minutes is already to two significant figures, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people prefer answers in hours and minutes, but since 50 minutes is less than an hour, it's fine as is.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expected the answer in seconds, I could convert minutes to seconds, but the problem uses minutes, so minutes is an appropriate unit.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way to approach this problem. Perhaps using proportions or graphs, but that seems unnecessary for this straightforward scenario.\n\nAnother way could be to think about it in terms of rates. The rate of change of volume is -10 liters per minute (negative because the volume is decreasing). So, the differential equation dv/dt = -10, with initial condition v(0) = 500.\n\nSolving that, v(t) = -10t + 500.\n\nSet v(t) = 0 to find when the tank is empty:\n\n0 = -10t + 500\n\n10t = 500\n\nt = 50 minutes\n\nWhich matches my initial calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the answer remains the same.\n\nI think I've confirmed sufficiently that the tank will be empty in 50 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
