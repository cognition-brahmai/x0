        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses in total in this small town. Out of these, 60 houses are blue, and all blue houses have red doors. That means the remaining houses must be green, right? So, if there are 100 houses and 60 are blue, then 100 minus 60 is 40. So, there are 40 green houses.\n\nNow, it's given that all green houses have yellow doors. So, if there are 40 green houses, and each has a yellow door, then there are 40 houses with yellow doors.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nWe know:\n\n- Total houses: 100\n\n- Blue houses: 60, and all have red doors\n\n- Green houses: the rest, which is 40, and all have yellow doors\n\nThe question is, how many houses have yellow doors?\n\nSince only green houses have yellow doors, and there are 40 green houses, then the number of houses with yellow doors should be 40.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe there are other houses that could have yellow doors besides the green ones. But according to the information given, all blue houses have red doors, and all green houses have yellow doors. There's no mention of any other colors or houses with different door colors.\n\nSo, it's safe to conclude that there are 40 houses with yellow doors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
