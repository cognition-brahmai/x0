        "content": "So the restaurant serves 100 meals a day, and each meal includes one piece of bread. That means they need 100 pieces of bread per day.\n\nNow, each loaf of bread has 20 slices. So, to find out how many loaves they need, I should divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per loaf.\n\nSo, 100 slices divided by 20 slices per loaf equals 5 loaves.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\n1 loaf = 20 slices\n\nSo, 5 loaves = 5 x 20 = 100 slices.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of how many loaves are needed for 100 slices.\n\nSo, number of loaves = total slices needed / slices per loaf.\n\nWhich is 100 / 20 = 5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here. It's a straightforward division problem.\n\nSo, the restaurant needs 5 loaves of bread per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
