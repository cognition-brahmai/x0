        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells books and CDs. Each book costs $12, and each CD costs $8. A customer buys a total of 15 items for $156, and we need to find out how many books and CDs they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's use variables to represent the unknowns. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of books bought.\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of CDs bought.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items bought is 15.\n\n2. The total cost of these items is $156.\n\nSo, we can translate these into two equations.\n\nThe first equation is about the total number of items:\n\n\\[ b + c = 15 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total cost:\n\n\\[ 12b + 8c = 156 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be straightforward here.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s simplify the second equation to make it easier to work with. We can divide all terms in the second equation by 4 to reduce the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12b}{4} + \\frac{8c}{4} = \\frac{156}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ 3b + 2c = 39 \\]\n\nSo now our system of equations is:\n\n1. \\( b + c = 15 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3b + 2c = 39 \\)\n\nI think we can use the first equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let\u2019s solve the first equation for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 15 - c \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( b \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3(15 - c) + 2c = 39 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s distribute the 3:\n\n\\[ 45 - 3c + 2c = 39 \\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[ 45 - c = 39 \\]\n\nSubtract 45 from both sides:\n\n\\[ -c = -6 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\[ c = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 6 CDs. Now, we can plug this value back into the expression we have for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 15 - c = 15 - 6 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 9 books and 6 CDs.\n\nTo make sure this is correct, let\u2019s check the total cost:\n\n- 9 books at $12 each: \\( 9 \\times 12 = 108 \\)\n\n- 6 CDs at $8 each: \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\)\n\n- Total: \\( 108 + 48 = 156 \\)\n\nThat matches the total cost given in the problem. Also, the total number of items is \\( 9 + 6 = 15 \\), which matches the total items bought.\n\nSo, the final answer is 9 books and 6 CDs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9 \\text{ books and } 6 \\text{ CDs}} \\]"
