        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two factories: Factory X and Factory Y. Factory X produces 800 items per day, and Factory Y produces 1200 items per day. Each item sells for $15, and we need to find out the combined daily revenue from both factories.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what revenue means. Revenue is the total income generated from sales. So, to find the revenue, I need to multiply the number of items produced by the price per item for each factory and then add those amounts together to get the combined revenue.\n\nLet me start with Factory X. It produces 800 items per day, and each item sells for $15. So, the daily revenue from Factory X would be:\n\nFactory X Revenue = Number of items produced by X * Price per item\n\nFactory X Revenue = 800 items * $15/item\n\nNow, 800 multiplied by 15. Let's see:\n\n800 * 10 = 8,000\n\n800 * 5 = 4,000\n\nSo, 8,000 + 4,000 = 12,000\n\nTherefore, Factory X's daily revenue is $12,000.\n\nNext, Factory Y produces 1200 items per day, and each item also sells for $15. So, the daily revenue from Factory Y would be:\n\nFactory Y Revenue = Number of items produced by Y * Price per item\n\nFactory Y Revenue = 1200 items * $15/item\n\nLet's calculate 1200 multiplied by 15.\n\n1200 * 10 = 12,000\n\n1200 * 5 = 6,000\n\nSo, 12,000 + 6,000 = 18,000\n\nTherefore, Factory Y's daily revenue is $18,000.\n\nNow, to find the combined daily revenue from both factories, I need to add the revenues from Factory X and Factory Y together:\n\nCombined Revenue = Factory X Revenue + Factory Y Revenue\n\nCombined Revenue = $12,000 + $18,000\n\nCombined Revenue = $30,000\n\nSo, the combined daily revenue from both factories is $30,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for Factory X: 800 items * $15/item = $12,000. That seems correct.\n\nFor Factory Y: 1200 items * $15/item = $18,000. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding those together: $12,000 + $18,000 = $30,000. Yes, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in another way to confirm. The total number of items produced per day by both factories is:\n\nTotal items = Factory X production + Factory Y production\n\nTotal items = 800 + 1200 = 2,000 items\n\nThen, the combined revenue would be:\n\nCombined Revenue = Total items * Price per item\n\nCombined Revenue = 2,000 items * $15/item\n\n2,000 * 15 is 30,000. So, again, $30,000.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that the combined daily revenue is indeed $30,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other factors that might affect the revenue. For example, are there any costs involved, like production costs or taxes? The question doesn't mention any costs other than the sale price per item, so I don't need to account for those.\n\nAlso, the question specifies that each item sells for $15, so I can assume that all items produced are sold. There's no information about unsold items, so I'll proceed with the assumption that everything produced is sold.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the currency. The price is given in dollars, and there's no mention of exchange rates or different currencies, so I don't need to worry about currency conversions.\n\nMoreover, the question is about daily revenue, and the production rates are given per day, so the time frame is consistent.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The combined daily revenue from both factories is $30,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000} \\]"
