        "content": "So in this election scenario, there are three candidates: Alice, Bob, and Carol. There are a total of 10,000 voters, and the votes are distributed percentages: Alice gets 45%, Bob gets 35%, and Carol gets 20%. The question is asking how many more votes Alice gets than Bob.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many votes each candidate gets. Since there are 10,000 voters, I can calculate the number of votes for each candidate by multiplying the total number of voters by the percentage each candidate received.\n\nLet's start with Alice. She got 45% of the votes. So, the number of votes Alice received is:\n\nVotes for Alice = 45% of 10,000\n\nTo calculate this, I can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:\n\n45% = 45/100 = 0.45\n\nThen, multiply by the total number of voters:\n\nVotes for Alice = 0.45 * 10,000 = 4,500 votes\n\nNext, for Bob, who got 35% of the votes:\n\nVotes for Bob = 35% of 10,000\n\nAgain, convert the percentage to a decimal:\n\n35% = 35/100 = 0.35\n\nThen, multiply by the total number of voters:\n\nVotes for Bob = 0.35 * 10,000 = 3,500 votes\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes Alice got than Bob, I need to subtract the number of votes Bob received from the number of votes Alice received:\n\nDifference = Votes for Alice - Votes for Bob\n\nDifference = 4,500 - 3,500 = 1,000 votes\n\nSo, Alice got 1,000 more votes than Bob.\n\nJust to double-check, let's make sure the votes add up correctly with Carol's votes. Carol got 20% of the votes:\n\nVotes for Carol = 20% of 10,000\n\nConvert percentage to decimal:\n\n20% = 20/100 = 0.20\n\nThen, multiply by the total number of voters:\n\nVotes for Carol = 0.20 * 10,000 = 2,000 votes\n\nNow, let's add up all the votes:\n\nTotal votes = Votes for Alice + Votes for Bob + Votes for Carol\n\nTotal votes = 4,500 + 3,500 + 2,000 = 10,000 votes\n\nThis matches the total number of voters, so the calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, Alice got 1,000 more votes than Bob.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
