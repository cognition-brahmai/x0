        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a bash script that checks if a given directory exists. If it does, I need to list all the files in that directory along with their sizes. If it doesn't exist, I need to create the directory. Sounds straightforward. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to write a bash script, so I'll start by opening a text editor and creating a new file, let's say `check_dir.sh`. Since it's a script, I need to make sure it has the proper shebang at the top to indicate that it should be run with bash. So, the first line will be `#!/bin/bash`.\n\nNext, I need to accept a directory name as input from the user. I can do this by using a command-line argument. In bash, command-line arguments are accessed using `$1`, `$2`, etc., where `$1` is the first argument. So, I'll assume the directory name is passed as the first argument to the script.\n\nNow, I need to check if this directory exists. Bash has a test command, which can be used with square brackets like `[ -d \"$1\" ]` to check if `$1` is a directory. If it is, I'll list the files with their sizes; if not, I'll create the directory.\n\nLet me think about listing the files with their sizes. I can use the `ls` command with the `-l` option to get a long listing, which includes the file size. But maybe I can format it a bit better. Perhaps I can use `du` with the `-h` option to get human-readable sizes.\n\nWait, `du` is typically used for disk usage, but I think `ls -lh` would be more appropriate for listing files with human-readable sizes. So, `ls -lh` in the directory would suffice.\n\nIf the directory doesn't exist, I'll create it using the `mkdir` command. I should also print some messages to let the user know what's happening. For example, if the directory exists, I can print \"Directory exists. Listing files:\" followed by the list of files. If it doesn't exist, I can print \"Directory does not exist. Creating directory.\"\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases, like if the directory name is empty or if there are permission issues. Maybe I should add some error checking.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if the directory exists using `[ -d \"$1\" ]`.\n\n2. If it exists:\n\na. Print \"Directory exists. Listing files:\"\n\nb. Run `ls -lh` to list files with human-readable sizes.\n\n3. If it doesn't exist:\n\na. Print \"Directory does not exist. Creating directory.\"\n\nb. Use `mkdir \"$1\"` to create the directory.\n\n4. Add some error handling, like checking if the directory name is provided.\n\nI think that covers the basic requirements. Now, I'll write the script accordingly.\n\nWait, I should also consider if the provided argument is not a directory but a file. For example, if someone passes a file path instead of a directory path. The `[ -d \"$1\" ]` test should handle this because it specifically checks if it's a directory.\n\nBut maybe I should also check if the argument is provided. If no argument is provided, the script should print an error message saying that a directory name is required.\n\nAlso, I should quote the variables to prevent word splitting and globbing.\n\nLet me think about permissions. If the script is run without sufficient permissions to create the directory or list its contents, it might fail. Maybe I should handle permission errors gracefully.\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple and just perform the checks and actions as outlined.\n\nLet me start writing the script.\n\nFirst, the shebang:\n\n`#!/bin/bash`\n\nThen, check if the directory name is provided:\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Error: Directory name is required.\"\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nNext, check if the directory exists:\n\nif [ -d \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Directory exists. Listing files:\"\n\nls -lh \"$1\"\n\nelse\n\necho \"Directory does not exist. Creating directory.\"\n\nmkdir \"$1\"\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n\necho \"Directory created successfully.\"\n\nelse\n\necho \"Failed to create directory.\"\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nfi\n\nWait, I should consider if the directory cannot be created due to permission issues or if the parent directory doesn't exist. Maybe I should use `mkdir -p` to create parent directories if they don't exist.\n\nAlso, I can capture the output of `ls -lh` and format it if needed, but for now, this should suffice.\n\nLet me also add a line to check if the directory is accessible, meaning it exists and permission is granted to list its contents.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll proceed with the current approach.\n\nLet me save this script and make it executable with `chmod +x check_dir.sh`.\n\nNow, I can test the script with an existing directory and a non-existing directory to see if it works as expected.\n\nFirst, test with an existing directory:\n\n`./check_dir.sh /existing/dir`\n\nIt should print:\n\nDirectory exists. Listing files:\n\ntotal 12K\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 4.0K Jan 1 12:34 file1.txt\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 4.0K Jan 1 12:34 file2.txt\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNext, test with a non-existing directory:\n\n`./check_dir.sh /nonexisting/dir`\n\nIt should print:\n\nDirectory does not exist. Creating directory.\n\nDirectory created successfully.\n\nThen, if I run the script again with the same directory, it should now list the files, which would be none since it's newly created.\n\nI should also test with invalid directory names or without any arguments.\n\nFor example:\n\n`./check_dir.sh`\n\nShould print:\n\nError: Directory name is required.\n\nAnd\n\n`./check_dir.sh some/file.txt`\n\nIf `some/file.txt` is a file, it should treat it as a directory and try to create it, which might not be the desired behavior. Maybe I should add a check to see if the path is a file and prompt the user accordingly.\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the path is a file and inform the user that it's a file, not a directory.\n\nI can use `[ -f \"$1\" ]` to check if it's a file.\n\nSo, I can add an extra check:\n\nif [ -f \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Error: $1 is a file, not a directory.\"\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nThis way, if the provided path is a file, it will print an error message and exit.\n\nAlright, I'll add that to the script.\n\nSo, the updated script would look like this:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Error: Directory name is required.\"\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nif [ -f \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Error: $1 is a file, not a directory.\"\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nif [ -d \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Directory exists. Listing files:\"\n\nls -lh \"$1\"\n\nelse\n\necho \"Directory does not exist. Creating directory.\"\n\nmkdir -p \"$1\"\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n\necho \"Directory created successfully.\"\n\nelse\n\necho \"Failed to create directory.\"\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nfi\n\nI think this covers most of the scenarios. I can test it again with different cases to ensure it works correctly.\n\nLet me consider another scenario: if the directory exists but I don't have permissions to list its contents.\n\nFor example:\n\n`./check_dir.sh /some/protected/dir`\n\nIt should try to list the files, but since I don't have permissions, `ls` will fail.\n\nI can capture the exit status of `ls` and handle the error accordingly.\n\nMaybe I should redirect the error output to get a better message.\n\nLet me think about how to handle that.\n\nI can run `ls -lh \"$1\" 2>/dev/null` to suppress the error message, and then check if any files were listed. If not, I can print an error message.\n\nBut that might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can run `ls -lh \"$1\"` and check its exit status. If it fails, I can print an error message.\n\nLike this:\n\nif ! ls -lh \"$1\" 2>/dev/null; then\n\necho \"Error: Unable to list files in $1\"\n\nfi\n\nBut then, the output of `ls` would be suppressed. I want to print the list if it succeeds, and an error message if it fails.\n\nMaybe I can do something like:\n\necho \"Directory exists. Listing files:\"\n\nif ! ls -lh \"$1\"; then\n\necho \"Error: Unable to list files in $1\" >&2\n\nfi\n\nThis way, if `ls` succeeds, it prints the list; if it fails, it prints an error message to stderr.\n\nThat seems better.\n\nSimilarly, when creating the directory, if `mkdir -p \"$1\"` fails, I can print an error message.\n\nI should also consider if the directory cannot be created due to permission issues.\n\nFor example:\n\n`./check_dir.sh /some/protected/dir/newdir`\n\nIf `/some/protected/dir` is not writable, `mkdir` will fail with permission denied.\n\nIn such cases, the script should inform the user about the permission issue.\n\nBut handling all possible error scenarios might complicate the script. For now, I'll keep it simple and just indicate that the directory creation failed.\n\nIf needed, I can capture the error message from `mkdir` and print it.\n\nBut bash scripts don't capture error messages from commands by default. I can use `echo $?` to get the exit status, but not the error message.\n\nAlternatively, I can use `mkdir -p \"$1\" || { echo \"Failed to create directory: $?\" >&2; exit 1; }`\n\nThis way, if `mkdir` fails, it prints the error status code.\n\nBut again, it's not very informative.\n\nMaybe I should just rely on the default error messages from `mkdir` and `ls`.\n\nWait, no. If I run `mkdir` without redirecting its error output, it will print the error message itself.\n\nSo, perhaps I don't need to capture and print the error message again.\n\nI can simply attempt to run `mkdir -p \"$1\"`, and if it fails, print a generic error message.\n\nSimilarly for `ls`.\n\nLet me adjust the script accordingly.\n\nHere's an updated version:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Error: Directory name is required.\" >&2\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nif [ -f \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Error: $1 is a file, not a directory.\" >&2\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nif [ -d \"$1\" ]; then\n\necho \"Directory exists. Listing files:\"\n\nif ! ls -lh \"$1\"; then\n\necho \"Error: Unable to list files in $1\" >&2\n\nexit 1\n\nfi\n\nelse\n\necho \"Directory does not exist. Creating directory.\"\n\nif ! mkdir -p \"$1\"; then\n\necho \"Failed to create directory.\" >&2\n\nexit 1\n\nelse\n\necho \"Directory created successfully.\"\n\nfi\n\nfi\n\nI'm redirecting error messages to stderr using `>&2` to maintain proper logging practices.\n\nI should also consider if the directory is a symbolic link. If it's a symlink to a directory, `[ -d \"$1\" ]` will still treat it as a directory, which is probably fine for this script.\n\nBut if I want to strictly check for actual directories and not symlinks, I can use `[ -d \"$1\" ]` combined with `[ ! -L \"$1\" ]`, but that might be overkill for this scenario.\n\nI think treating symlinks to directories as directories is acceptable.\n\nLet me test the script with a symlink.\n\nCreate a directory:\n\nmkdir testdir\n\nCreate a file inside it:\n\ntouch testdir/file.txt\n\nCreate a symlink to testdir:\n\nln -s testdir symlink_test\n\nNow, run the script with `symlink_test` as the argument.\n\nIt should treat it as a directory and list the files inside it.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother consideration: if the directory name contains spaces or special characters, quoting the variables should handle that.\n\nFor example:\n\ndirectory_name=\"my dir with spaces\"\n\nmkdir \"$directory_name\"\n\ntouch \"$directory_name/file.txt\"\n\nThen run the script with `my dir with spaces` as the argument.\n\nSince I'm using quotes around \"$1\", it should handle spaces correctly.\n\nI should also think about whether the script should support multiple directory names. But for now, I'll assume only one directory is provided.\n\nIf I want to support multiple directories, I can modify the script to loop through all arguments, but that's beyond the current requirements.\n\nAlright, I think the script is in a good state now. I can save it and make it executable, then run some tests to verify its behavior.\n\nLet me summarize the script's behavior:\n\n- It requires one argument: the directory name.\n\n- If no argument is provided, it prints an error message and exits.\n\n- If the provided path is a file, it prints an error message and exits.\n\n- If the directory exists, it lists its contents with human-readable sizes.\n\n- If the directory doesn't exist, it creates the directory using `mkdir -p`.\n\n- It handles errors appropriately and prints messages to inform the user about the actions taken.\n\nThis should meet the requirements specified.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a bash script that checks if a given directory exists and either lists its contents or creates the directory, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create the script file:**\n   Open a text editor and create a new file, e.g., `check_dir.sh`.\n\n2. **Add the shebang line:**\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   ```\n   This tells the system to use bash to execute the script.\n\n3. **Check if the directory name is provided:**\n   ```bash\n   if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n       echo \"Error: Directory name is required.\" >&2\n       exit 1\n   fi\n   ```\n   This ensures that a directory name is provided as an argument. If not, it prints an error message and exits.\n\n4. **Check if the provided path is a file:**\n   ```bash\n   if [ -f \"$1\" ]; then\n       echo \"Error: $1 is a file, not a directory.\" >&2\n       exit 1\n   fi\n   ```\n   If the provided path is a file, it prints an error message and exits.\n\n5. **Check if the directory exists:**\n   ```bash\n   if [ -d \"$1\" ]; then\n       echo \"Directory exists. Listing files:\"\n       if ! ls -lh \"$1\"; then\n           echo \"Error: Unable to list files in $1\" >&2\n           exit 1\n       fi\n   else\n       echo \"Directory does not exist. Creating directory.\"\n       if ! mkdir -p \"$1\"; then\n           echo \"Failed to create directory.\" >&2\n           exit 1\n       else\n           echo \"Directory created successfully.\"\n       fi\n   fi\n   ```\n   - If the directory exists, it lists its contents with human-readable sizes.\n   - If the directory does not exist, it creates the directory using `mkdir -p`.\n\n6. **Make the script executable:**\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x check_dir.sh\n   ```\n\n7. **Run the script:**\n   ```bash\n   ./check_dir.sh <directory_name>\n   ```\n\n### Complete Script\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: Directory name is required.\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ -f \"$1\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: $1 is a file, not a directory.\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ -d \"$1\" ]; then\n    echo \"Directory exists. Listing files:\"\n    if ! ls -lh \"$1\"; then\n        echo \"Error: Unable to list files in $1\" >&2\n        exit 1\n    fi\nelse\n    echo \"Directory does not exist. Creating directory.\"\n    if ! mkdir -p \"$1\"; then\n        echo \"Failed to create directory.\" >&2\n        exit 1\n    else\n        echo \"Directory created successfully.\"\n    fi\nfi\n```\n\nThis script provides a robust way to handle directory checks and creations, ensuring that users are informed about the actions taken and any potential errors encountered."
