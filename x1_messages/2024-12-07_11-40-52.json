        "content": "Let's see. There are about 7.9 billion people on Earth, and each person takes around 5 breaths per minute. I need to find out how many total breaths all humans take in one day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many minutes there are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 1,440 minutes/day\n\nNow, each person takes 5 breaths per minute, so in one minute, one person takes 5 breaths.\n\nIn one day, one person would take:\n\n5 breaths/minute \u00d7 1,440 minutes/day = 7,200 breaths/day\n\nNow, there are approximately 7.9 billion people, so to find the total breaths per day for all humans, I need to multiply the number of breaths one person takes in a day by the total number of people.\n\n7,200 breaths/day/person \u00d7 7,900,000,000 people\n\nBut to make it easier, I can write it as:\n\n7,200 \u00d7 7.9 billion\n\nNow, 7.9 billion is 7,900,000,000.\n\nSo, 7,200 \u00d7 7,900,000,000\n\nI can break this down:\n\nFirst, 7,200 \u00d7 7,000,000,000 = 7,200 \u00d7 7 billion\n\n7,200 \u00d7 7 = 50,400\n\nSo, 50,400 billion\n\nAnd then, 7,200 \u00d7 900,000,000 = 7,200 \u00d7 900 million\n\n7,200 \u00d7 900 = 6,480,000\n\nSo, 6,480,000 million, which is 6,480 billion\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n50,400 billion + 6,480 billion = 56,880 billion\n\nBut billion can be a bit confusing because in some countries, a billion is 10^9 and in others, it's 10^12. To avoid confusion, I'll express it in scientific notation.\n\n7,200 \u00d7 7,900,000,000 = 7.2 \u00d7 10^3 \u00d7 7.9 \u00d7 10^9 = 7.2 \u00d7 7.9 \u00d7 10^{12}\n\n7.2 \u00d7 7.9 is approximately 56.88\n\nSo, 56.88 \u00d7 10^{12} = 5.688 \u00d7 10^{13}\n\nTherefore, all humans take approximately 5.688 \u00d7 10^{13} breaths in one day.\n\nTo put it in perspective, that's 56.88 trillion breaths per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.688 \\times 10^{13}} \\]"
