        "content": "Let's see here. The farmer has 10 acres of land, and each acre yields an average of 150 bushels of corn. So, first, I need to find out how many bushels of corn he gets in total from all 10 acres.\n\nTo do that, I'll multiply the number of acres by the yield per acre:\n\n10 acres * 150 bushels per acre = 1500 bushels\n\nSo, the farmer gets a total of 1500 bushels of corn from his entire land.\n\nNow, he sells each bushel for $5. To find out the total revenue, I need to multiply the total number of bushels by the price per bushel:\n\n1500 bushels * $5 per bushel = $7500\n\nTherefore, the farmer will generate $7500 from his entire harvest.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Like, are there any costs involved in harvesting or selling the corn that might affect the revenue? The question asks for revenue, not profit, so I think revenue is just the total income from selling the corn, before deducting any costs.\n\nSo, yeah, $7500 should be the revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7500} \\]"
