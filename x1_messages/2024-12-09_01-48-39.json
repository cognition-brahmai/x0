        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (4^2 - 3 * 2) / (8 - 5). First, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the numerator: 4^2 - 3 * 2.\n\nFirst, exponents: 4^2 is 16. So now it's 16 - 3 * 2.\n\nNext, multiplication: 3 * 2 is 6. So now it's 16 - 6.\n\nThen, subtraction: 16 - 6 is 10.\n\nSo the numerator is 10.\n\nNow, the denominator: 8 - 5.\n\nSubtraction: 8 - 5 is 3.\n\nSo the denominator is 3.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 10 / 3.\n\nDividing 10 by 3 gives approximately 3.333..., or as a fraction, it's 10/3.\n\nSo, the final answer is 10/3 or approximately 3.333.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{10}{3}} \\]"
