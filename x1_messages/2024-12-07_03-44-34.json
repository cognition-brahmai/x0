        "content": "So I've got this problem here about mixing candy bars to get a specific total weight and chocolate percentage. Let's see... there are two types of candy bars: Type A and Type B. Type A weighs 120 grams and has 60% chocolate, and Type B weighs 150 grams with 40% chocolate. I need to figure out how many of each type to mix to get a total of 1,200 grams that's exactly 50% chocolate.\n\nFirst, I think I should define variables for the number of each type of candy bar. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A candy bars.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B candy bars.\n\nNow, I need to set up equations based on the total weight and the total chocolate content.\n\nStarting with the total weight:\n\nEach Type A bar is 120 grams, and each Type B is 150 grams, and together they should weigh 1,200 grams. So, the equation for total weight is:\n\n\\( 120x + 150y = 1200 \\)\n\nNext, the chocolate content:\n\nType A has 60% chocolate, so each Type A bar contains \\( 0.60 \\times 120 = 72 \\) grams of chocolate.\n\nType B has 40% chocolate, so each Type B bar contains \\( 0.40 \\times 150 = 60 \\) grams of chocolate.\n\nThe mixture should be 50% chocolate, so in 1,200 grams, the chocolate content should be \\( 0.50 \\times 1200 = 600 \\) grams.\n\nTherefore, the equation for the total chocolate content is:\n\n\\( 72x + 60y = 600 \\)\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( 120x + 150y = 1200 \\)\n\n2. \\( 72x + 60y = 600 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nFirst, I can simplify both equations to make them easier to work with.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\n\n\\( 120x + 150y = 1200 \\)\n\nI can divide the entire equation by 30:\n\n\\( \\frac{120x}{30} + \\frac{150y}{30} = \\frac{1200}{30} \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 4x + 5y = 40 \\) ...(1a)\n\nNow, equation 2:\n\n\\( 72x + 60y = 600 \\)\n\nDivide the entire equation by 12:\n\n\\( \\frac{72x}{12} + \\frac{60y}{12} = \\frac{600}{12} \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 6x + 5y = 50 \\) ...(2a)\n\nNow, I have:\n\n1. \\( 4x + 5y = 40 \\)\n\n2. \\( 6x + 5y = 50 \\)\n\nI can subtract equation 1a from equation 2a to eliminate \\( y \\):\n\n\\( (6x + 5y) - (4x + 5y) = 50 - 40 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( 2x = 10 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nNow, plug \\( x = 5 \\) back into equation 1a to find \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 4(5) + 5y = 40 \\)\n\n\\( 20 + 5y = 40 \\)\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\( 5y = 20 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = 4 \\)\n\nTherefore, I need 5 Type A candy bars and 4 Type B candy bars.\n\nBut, I should check if this makes sense in terms of the total weight and chocolate content.\n\nFirst, total weight:\n\n\\( 120 \\times 5 + 150 \\times 4 = 600 + 600 = 1200 \\) grams. That checks out.\n\nNow, chocolate content:\n\nFrom Type A: \\( 5 \\times 72 = 360 \\) grams\n\nFrom Type B: \\( 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\) grams\n\nTotal chocolate: \\( 360 + 240 = 600 \\) grams\n\nThe mixture is supposed to be 50% chocolate, so \\( 0.5 \\times 1200 = 600 \\) grams. That matches.\n\nWait a minute, but according to my calculation, \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\), but when I check the chocolate content, it adds up correctly, but let's see:\n\nType A: 5 bars \u00d7 72 grams = 360 grams of chocolate\n\nType B: 4 bars \u00d7 60 grams = 240 grams of chocolate\n\nTotal chocolate: 360 + 240 = 600 grams\n\nTotal weight: 1200 grams\n\nPercentage: \\( \\frac{600}{1200} = 0.5 \\), which is 50%. So, it's correct.\n\nBut, I recall that in my initial simplification, I divided the equations by 30 and 12, respectively, which are correct steps.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the problem in terms of the chocolate concentration.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the chocolate content per bar:\n\nType A: 72 grams of chocolate per bar\n\nType B: 60 grams of chocolate per bar\n\nWe want a mixture with 600 grams of chocolate in 1200 grams, which is 50% chocolate.\n\nThis is similar to a weighted average problem.\n\nLet\u2019s use the concept of alligation to find the ratio of Type A to Type B.\n\nAlligation method:\n\nDesired percentage: 50%\n\nType A: 60%\n\nType B: 40%\n\nDifference from desired:\n\nType A: 60% - 50% = 10%\n\nType B: 50% - 40% = 10%\n\nSo, the ratio of Type A to Type B is 10% : 10% = 1:1\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, it's 5 Type A and 4 Type B, which is not exactly 1:1. Maybe I'm misapplying the alligation method here.\n\nLet me recall that the alligation method is used to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at different prices or concentrations are mixed to produce a mixture at a given price or concentration.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\(\\frac{Quantity\\ of\\ cheaper}{Quantity\\ of\\ dearer} = \\frac{Cost\\ price\\ of\\ dearer\\ -\\ Mean\\ price}{Mean\\ price\\ -\\ Cost\\ price\\ of\\ cheaper}\\)\n\nIn this context, \"cheaper\" and \"dearer\" refer to the concentrations.\n\nLet\u2019s consider Type B (40% chocolate) as the cheaper and Type A (60% chocolate) as the dearer.\n\nThe mean price is 50%.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\n\\(\\frac{Quantity\\ of\\ B}{Quantity\\ of\\ A} = \\frac{60\\% - 50\\%}{50\\% - 40\\%} = \\frac{10\\%}{10\\%} = 1:1\\)\n\nThis suggests that the quantities of A and B should be in the ratio 1:1.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, it's 5:4, which is not exactly 1:1. There must be a mistake in my application of the alligation method.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual weights of the bars, not just the percentages.\n\nBecause each bar has a different weight, simply using the percentage differences might not account for the actual amounts being mixed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the equations differently.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the total chocolate from both types.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of Type A bars.\n\nLet \\( y \\) be the number of Type B bars.\n\nTotal weight equation:\n\n\\( 120x + 150y = 1200 \\)\n\nChocolate content equation:\n\n\\( 72x + 60y = 600 \\)\n\nNow, I can solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\( 120x + 150y = 1200 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 30:\n\n\\( 4x + 5y = 40 \\) ...(1)\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n\\( 72x + 60y = 600 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\n\\( 6x + 5y = 50 \\) ...(2)\n\nNow, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n\\( (6x + 5y) - (4x + 5y) = 50 - 40 \\)\n\n\\( 2x = 10 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 5 \\) back into equation (1):\n\n\\( 4(5) + 5y = 40 \\)\n\n\\( 20 + 5y = 40 \\)\n\n\\( 5y = 20 \\)\n\n\\( y = 4 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y = 4 \\)\n\nWait, but according to alligation, it should be a 1:1 ratio, but according to this, it's 5:4. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nPerhaps the alligation method isn't directly applicable because the bars have different weights, not just different concentrations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to adjust the alligation method to account for the different weights per bar.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose I consider the weight of chocolate per gram of candy bar.\n\nType A: 72 grams chocolate per 120 grams bar \u2192 \\(\\frac{72}{120} = 0.6\\) or 60% chocolate\n\nType B: 60 grams chocolate per 150 grams bar \u2192 \\(\\frac{60}{150} = 0.4\\) or 40% chocolate\n\nDesired mixture: 600 grams chocolate per 1200 grams mixture \u2192 \\(\\frac{600}{1200} = 0.5\\) or 50% chocolate\n\nSo, the percentages are as given.\n\nBut the alligation method is giving a 1:1 ratio, while the equation method gives 5:4.\n\nMaybe I'm misapplying the alligation method.\n\nLet me look up the alligation method for different weights.\n\nWait, perhaps the alligation method assumes that the quantities being mixed are of the same base unit, which in this case, they aren't, because the bars have different weights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the cost price in terms of chocolate per gram.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the chocolate content per gram of candy.\n\nFor Type A: 0.6 chocolate per gram\n\nFor Type B: 0.4 chocolate per gram\n\nDesired: 0.5 chocolate per gram\n\nNow, applying alligation:\n\nDifference for A: 0.6 - 0.5 = 0.1\n\nDifference for B: 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1\n\nSo, the ratio is 0.1 : 0.1, which is 1:1\n\nBut earlier calculation gave 5:4. Maybe because the bars have different weights, the ratio in numbers isn't 1:1.\n\nWait, if I take 1 bar of A (120 grams) and 1 bar of B (150 grams), total weight is 270 grams, with:\n\nChocolate from A: 72 grams\n\nChocolate from B: 60 grams\n\nTotal chocolate: 132 grams\n\nPercentage in mixture: \\(\\frac{132}{270} \\approx 0.4889\\) or 48.89%, which is less than 50%.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, 5 Type A and 4 Type B give exactly 50%.\n\nSo, perhaps the alligation method needs to be adjusted for the different weights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe alligation assumes that the quantities mixed are of equal weight, which isn't the case here.\n\nGiven that, perhaps alligation isn't directly applicable here, and the equation method is more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the weight of chocolate per bar and set up proportions accordingly.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s think in terms of the weight of chocolate per bar.\n\nType A: 72 grams per bar\n\nType B: 60 grams per bar\n\nTotal chocolate needed: 600 grams\n\nSo, \\( 72x + 60y = 600 \\)\n\nAnd total weight: \\( 120x + 150y = 1200 \\)\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) from one equation and substitute into the other.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\( 120x + 150y = 1200 \\)\n\nLet's solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 150y = 1200 - 120x \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{1200 - 120x}{150} \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{1200}{150} - \\frac{120x}{150} \\)\n\n\\( y = 8 - \\frac{4x}{5} \\)\n\nNow, plug this into the second equation:\n\n\\( 72x + 60\\left(8 - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right) = 600 \\)\n\n\\( 72x + 480 - 48x = 600 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 24x + 480 = 600 \\)\n\nSubtract 480 from both sides:\n\n\\( 24x = 120 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nThen, \\( y = 8 - \\frac{4(5)}{5} = 8 - 4 = 4 \\)\n\nAgain, \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y = 4 \\)\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I keep getting 5 Type A bars and 4 Type B bars.\n\nPerhaps the alligation method is not directly applicable here because it assumes that the quantities mixed are of the same base unit, which in this case, they aren't due to the different weights per bar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to adjust the alligation method to account for the different weights.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps alligation is better suited for problems where the quantities are mixed in terms of cost per unit weight, not necessarily considering the varying weights of the items being mixed.\n\nGiven that, I think the equation method is more appropriate here, and the solution is 5 Type A bars and 4 Type B bars.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the weight of the mixture per bar.\n\nWait, that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the weight of chocolate per gram of candy bar.\n\nBut I think I've spent enough time on this. The equation method seems solid, and it consistently gives me \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y = 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5 Type A candy bars and 4 Type B candy bars.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the difference in chocolate content from the desired 50%.\n\nType A has 60% chocolate, which is 10% more than 50%.\n\nType B has 40% chocolate, which is 10% less than 50%.\n\nSo, for every bar of Type A, I'm adding 10% more chocolate than desired, and for every bar of Type B, I'm adding 10% less chocolate than desired.\n\nTo balance this out, I need to have more Type A than Type B to make up for the lower chocolate content in Type B.\n\nIn my calculation, 5 Type A and 4 Type B, which is slightly more of Type A, makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if it were exactly 1:1, as the alligation method suggested, but that didn't match the actual calculation, so perhaps alligation isn't directly applicable here.\n\nGiven all that, I'm confident that the correct answer is 5 Type A candy bars and 4 Type B candy bars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ Type A candy bars and } 4 \\text{ Type B candy bars}} \\]"
