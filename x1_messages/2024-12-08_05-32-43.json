They want to count occurrences of the word 'innovation' within their company's annual reports. This implies that there are multiple documents (annual reports) that need to be searched through for this specific word.\n\nLooking at the available functions:\n\n1. **document_analysis**:\n   - Description: Analyzes documents for specific keywords, phrases, or patterns.\n   - Parameters:\n     - keyword: Word or phrase to search for in the document.\n\n2. **file_search**:\n   - Description: Searches files for specific content.\n   - Parameters:\n     - filename: Name of the file to search.\n     - content: Content to search for in the file.\n\nGiven that the user is interested in analyzing multiple documents (annual reports) for the frequency of a specific word ('innovation'), the `document_analysis` function seems more appropriate. This function is designed to analyze documents for keywords, which aligns directly with the user's request.\n\nThe `file_search` function, on the other hand, requires specifying a particular filename and the content to search for. While it could potentially be used for this purpose, it might be less efficient for searching through multiple files (annual reports) unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the `document_analysis` function with the parameter `keyword: innovation` to fulfill the user's request.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the word 'innovation' appears in the company's annual reports. Given the available functions, the most suitable one is `document_analysis`, which is designed to search for specific keywords within documents.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: Choose `document_analysis` because it is tailored for searching keywords in documents.\n2. **Specify Parameters**: Set the `keyword` parameter to 'innovation' to search for this specific term.\n3. **Format the Response**: Provide the function and parameters in YAML format as required.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```yaml\nfunction: document_analysis\nparameters:\n  keyword: innovation\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Function Selection**: `document_analysis` is selected over `file_search` because it is specifically designed for analyzing documents for keywords, which aligns perfectly with the task of counting occurrences of 'innovation' in annual reports.\n- **Parameters**: The `keyword` parameter is set to 'innovation' to direct the function to search for this particular word within the documents.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient as it targets the specific need without requiring manual specification of each file name, assuming that the function is capable of searching through multiple documents as indicated by the user's reference to \"annual reports.\""
