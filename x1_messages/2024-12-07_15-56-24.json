        "content": "To find the sum of all integers between 100 and 200 that are divisible by both 3 and 5, we need to identify numbers in that range that are divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15, so we're looking for numbers between 100 and 200 that are divisible by 15.\n\nFirst, let's find the smallest number greater than or equal to 100 that is divisible by 15. We can do this by dividing 100 by 15 and rounding up to the nearest whole number.\n\n100 \u00f7 15 = 6.666..., so the next whole number is 7.\n\nNow, multiply 15 by 7 to find the smallest number in the range:\n\n15 \u00d7 7 = 105.\n\nNext, find the largest number less than or equal to 200 that is divisible by 15. Divide 200 by 15:\n\n200 \u00f7 15 = 13.333..., so the largest whole number is 13.\n\nMultiply 15 by 13:\n\n15 \u00d7 13 = 195.\n\nNow, we need to find all multiples of 15 from 105 to 195 and sum them up.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195.\n\nTo find the sum, we can add these numbers together:\n\n105 + 120 = 225\n\n225 + 135 = 360\n\n360 + 150 = 510\n\n510 + 165 = 675\n\n675 + 180 = 855\n\n855 + 195 = 1050.\n\nSo, the sum is 1050.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term a_1 is 105, the last term a_n is 195, and the common difference d is 15.\n\nFirst, find the number of terms n:\n\nWe know that a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n195 = 105 + (n - 1) \u00d7 15.\n\nSubtract 105 from both sides:\n\n195 - 105 = (n - 1) \u00d7 15\n\n90 = (n - 1) \u00d7 15\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\n90 \u00f7 15 = n - 1\n\n6 = n - 1\n\nSo, n = 7.\n\nNow, the sum S_n of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\nS_n = n/2 \u00d7 (a_1 + a_n)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS_7 = 7/2 \u00d7 (105 + 195) = 7/2 \u00d7 300 = 7 \u00d7 150 = 1050.\n\nSo, the sum is 1050.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1050} \\]"
