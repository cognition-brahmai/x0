        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to implement a Python script that connects to a MongoDB database, creates a collection named \"users\", inserts five documents with name, age, and email fields, and then queries the collection to retrieve and display all documents. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the steps correctly.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up the environment. Since I'm using Python and MongoDB, I'll need to install the pymongo library, which is the official MongoDB driver for Python. I can install it using pip if it's not already installed.\n\nSo, step one: Install pymongo.\n\nI can do this by running:\n\n```bash\n\npip install pymongo\n\n```\n\nAssuming that's done, now I need to write the Python script.\n\nI need to connect to a MongoDB database. Typically, MongoDB runs on localhost and port 27017 by default. I'll assume that's the case here, but in a real-world scenario, I might need to connect to a different host or port.\n\nSo, in Python, using pymongo, connecting to the database would look something like this:\n\n```python\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\nclient = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n\ndb = client['mydatabase']\n\n```\n\nHere, 'mydatabase' is the name of the database I'm connecting to. If it doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it on the fly when I perform operations that require it.\n\nNext, I need to create a collection named \"users\". In MongoDB, collections are created when the first document is inserted into them, so I don't need to explicitly create the collection. I can just refer to it by name.\n\nSo, I can do:\n\n```python\n\ncollection = db['users']\n\n```\n\nNow, I need to insert five documents into this collection. Each document should have fields for name, age, and email.\n\nLet's define these documents. For example:\n\n```python\n\nusers = [\n\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"},\n\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"email\": \"bob@example.com\"},\n\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"email\": \"charlie@example.com\"},\n\n    {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"email\": \"david@example.com\"},\n\n    {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 22, \"email\": \"eve@example.com\"}\n\n]\n\n```\n\nTo insert these documents into the collection, I can use the insert_many method:\n\n```python\n\ncollection.insert_many(users)\n\n```\n\nThis should insert all five documents into the \"users\" collection.\n\nNow, I need to query the collection to retrieve all documents and display them.\n\nTo retrieve all documents, I can use the find method without any query parameters:\n\n```python\n\nall_users = collection.find()\n\n```\n\nThen, I can iterate over the cursor returned by find and print each document:\n\n```python\n\nfor user in all_users:\n\n    print(user)\n\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete script would look like this:\n\n```python\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n# Connect to the database\n\nclient = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n\ndb = client['mydatabase']\n\ncollection = db['users']\n\n# Define the users to insert\n\nusers = [\n\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"},\n\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"email\": \"bob@example.com\"},\n\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"email\": \"charlie@example.com\"},\n\n    {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"email\": \"david@example.com\"},\n\n    {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 22, \"email\": \"eve@example.com\"}\n\n]\n\n# Insert the users\n\ncollection.insert_many(users)\n\n# Retrieve and display all users\n\nall_users = collection.find()\n\nfor user in all_users:\n\n    print(user)\n\n```\n\nBefore running this script, I need to make sure that the MongoDB server is running on localhost at port 27017. If it's running on a different host or port, I need to adjust the connection string accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should handle any potential exceptions that might occur during the connection or data insertion processes. For example, if the MongoDB server is not running, MongoClient might raise a ConnectionFailure exception.\n\nTo make the script more robust, I can add try-except blocks:\n\n```python\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\nfrom pymongo.errors import ConnectionFailure\n\ntry:\n\n    # Connect to the database\n\n    client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n\n    db = client['mydatabase']\n\n    collection = db['users']\n\n    # Define the users to insert\n\n    users = [\n\n        {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"},\n\n        {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"email\": \"bob@example.com\"},\n\n        {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"email\": \"charlie@example.com\"},\n\n        {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"email\": \"david@example.com\"},\n\n        {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 22, \"email\": \"eve@example.com\"}\n\n    ]\n\n    # Insert the users\n\n    collection.insert_many(users)\n\n    # Retrieve and display all users\n\n    all_users = collection.find()\n\n    for user in all_users:\n\n        print(user)\n\nexcept ConnectionFailure:\n\n    print(\"Failed to connect to MongoDB\")\n\n```\n\nThis way, if there's a connection issue, the script will print \"Failed to connect to MongoDB\" instead of crashing.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to close the connection properly after I'm done with it. Although pymongo handles connection pooling and closing connections automatically, it's good practice to include it.\n\nI can do this by calling client.close():\n\n```python\n\nfinally:\n\n    client.close()\n\n```\n\nSo, the complete script with exception handling and proper connection closure would look like this:\n\n```python\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\nfrom pymongo.errors import ConnectionFailure\n\nclient = None\n\ntry:\n\n    # Connect to the database\n\n    client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n\n    db = client['mydatabase']\n\n    collection = db['users']\n\n    # Define the users to insert\n\n    users = [\n\n        {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"},\n\n        {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"email\": \"bob@example.com\"},\n\n        {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"email\": \"charlie@example.com\"},\n\n        {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"email\": \"david@example.com\"},\n\n        {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 22, \"email\": \"eve@example.com\"}\n\n    ]\n\n    # Insert the users\n\n    collection.insert_many(users)\n\n    # Retrieve and display all users\n\n    all_users = collection.find()\n\n    for user in all_users:\n\n        print(user)\n\nexcept ConnectionFailure:\n\n    print(\"Failed to connect to MongoDB\")\n\nfinally:\n\n    if client:\n\n        client.close()\n\n```\n\nThis script should fulfill the requirements: connect to MongoDB, create a \"users\" collection, insert five documents, and retrieve/display them.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo accomplish the task of connecting to a MongoDB database, creating a collection named \"users\", inserting five documents with name, age, and email fields, and then querying and displaying all documents, you can use the following Python script.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\nfrom pymongo.errors import ConnectionFailure\n\nclient = None\ntry:\n    # Connect to the database\n    client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n    db = client['mydatabase']\n    collection = db['users']\n\n    # Define the users to insert\n    users = [\n        {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"email\": \"bob@example.com\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"email\": \"charlie@example.com\"},\n        {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"email\": \"david@example.com\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 22, \"email\": \"eve@example.com\"}\n    ]\n\n    # Insert the users\n    collection.insert_many(users)\n\n    # Retrieve and display all users\n    all_users = collection.find()\n    for user in all_users:\n        print(user)\n\nexcept ConnectionFailure:\n    print(\"Failed to connect to MongoDB\")\n\nfinally:\n    if client:\n        client.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Installation**: Ensure `pymongo` is installed using `pip install pymongo`.\n\n2. **Connection**: Connect to the MongoDB database using `MongoClient`. The connection string assumes MongoDB is running locally on port 27017.\n\n3. **Database and Collection**: Access the database and collection. If they don't exist, they are created upon insertion.\n\n4. **Data Insertion**: Define a list of user documents and insert them into the collection using `insert_many`.\n\n5. **Query and Display**: Retrieve all documents from the collection using `find` and print each document.\n\n6. **Exception Handling**: Handle connection failures and ensure the client connection is closed in the `finally` block."
