        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The gardener wants to plant flowers along the perimeter, with each flower spaced 1 meter apart. I need to figure out how many flowers are needed for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is. I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, it's calculated by adding up all the sides. So, for this garden, there are two lengths and two widths.\n\nSo, the two lengths are each 30 meters, and the two widths are each 20 meters. So, the perimeter P would be:\n\nP = 2 * length + 2 * width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP = 2 * 30 + 2 * 20\n\nP = 60 + 40\n\nP = 100 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter is 100 meters.\n\nNow, the gardener wants to plant flowers along this perimeter, with each flower spaced 1 meter apart. So, if the perimeter is 100 meters, and each flower is 1 meter apart, it might seem like you just need 100 flowers.\n\nBut wait a minute, I need to think about this carefully. If you're placing flowers at intervals of 1 meter along a 100-meter perimeter, you might think it's 100 flowers, but actually, you have to consider that the first flower and the last flower would meet up if it's a closed shape like a rectangle.\n\nLet me think of it this way: imagine you're starting at one corner and planting flowers every 1 meter around the rectangle. When you get back to the starting point, the distance between the first and the last flower would also be 1 meter, so the first flower is also the last flower.\n\nSo, in a closed loop, the number of flowers needed is equal to the perimeter divided by the spacing between them.\n\nSo, number of flowers N = P / spacing\n\nHere, P is 100 meters, and spacing is 1 meter.\n\nSo, N = 100 / 1 = 100 flowers.\n\nBut, in a closed loop, you might actually need one less flower because the first and last flower are the same.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have a straight line that's 10 meters long and I plant flowers every 1 meter, starting at one end, I would have flowers at 0m, 1m, 2m, ..., up to 10m. So, that's 11 flowers for 10 meters.\n\nBut in a closed loop, like a circle or a rectangle, the starting point and the ending point are the same, so the first flower is also the last flower.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of flowers would be equal to the perimeter divided by the spacing.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, for a 10-meter line, I have 11 flowers, which is 10 / 1 + 1.\n\nBut in a closed loop, it's different.\n\nLet me find a better way to think about this.\n\nMaybe I should consider the perimeter as a closed path where the starting point and ending point are the same.\n\nSo, if the perimeter is 100 meters and flowers are spaced 1 meter apart, the number of flowers needed would be 100.\n\nBut in my straight line example, for 10 meters, I have 11 flowers, which is perimeter plus one.\n\nWait, no, in the straight line, it's length divided by spacing plus one.\n\nBut in a closed loop, it's perimeter divided by spacing.\n\nI think I need to look up the formula for number of objects in a closed loop versus an open line.\n\nActually, in a closed loop, the number of objects is equal to the perimeter divided by the spacing.\n\nIn an open line, it's length divided by spacing plus one.\n\nSo, in this case, since the garden is a rectangle, which is a closed shape, the number of flowers should be P / spacing.\n\nSo, N = 100 / 1 = 100 flowers.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think about a smaller scale.\n\nSuppose the rectangle is 2 meters by 1 meter.\n\nPerimeter P = 2*2 + 2*1 = 4 + 2 = 6 meters.\n\nSpacing is 1 meter.\n\nSo, number of flowers N = 6 / 1 = 6 flowers.\n\nIf I visualize this, starting at one corner:\n\n1. Corner A\n\n2. Along the 2-meter side to corner B\n\n3. Corner B\n\n4. Along the 1-meter side to corner C\n\n5. Corner C\n\n6. Along the 2-meter side to corner D\n\n7. Corner D\n\n8. Along the 1-meter side back to corner A, but since it's a closed loop, the first and eighth flower would be the same, so actually, it's 6 flowers.\n\nWait, hold on, in this case, for a perimeter of 6 meters with 1-meter spacing, it seems like you need 6 flowers.\n\nBut according to my earlier straight line logic, for a straight line of 2 meters with 1-meter spacing, you'd need 3 flowers.\n\nBut in a rectangle, it's a closed loop.\n\nSo, perhaps the general rule is:\n\nFor a closed loop: N = P / S\n\nFor an open line: N = L / S + 1\n\nWhere N is number of flowers, P is perimeter, S is spacing, L is length.\n\nSo, in this case, since it's a closed loop, N = 100 / 1 = 100 flowers.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another example.\n\nSuppose the rectangle is 1 meter by 1 meter.\n\nPerimeter P = 2*1 + 2*1 = 4 meters.\n\nSpacing S = 1 meter.\n\nN = 4 / 1 = 4 flowers.\n\nIf I visualize this, indeed, one flower at each corner, totaling 4 flowers.\n\nSo, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, for the original problem, with a perimeter of 100 meters and spacing of 1 meter, the number of flowers needed is 100.\n\nSo, the answer is 100 flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
