        "content": "So we have this problem about bacteria doubling every hour. Let's see, initially, there are 100 bacteria, and we need to find out how many there will be after 6 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"doubling every hour\" means. Does it mean that every hour, the number of bacteria increases by twice its current amount? So, for example, if I start with 100, after one hour, it would be 200, then 400 after two hours, and so on?\n\nYes, that makes sense. It's exponential growth because it's doubling at regular intervals. So, the growth pattern would be:\n\n- Start: 100\n\n- After 1 hour: 100 * 2 = 200\n\n- After 2 hours: 200 * 2 = 400\n\n- After 3 hours: 400 * 2 = 800\n\n- After 4 hours: 800 * 2 = 1600\n\n- After 5 hours: 1600 * 2 = 3200\n\n- After 6 hours: 3200 * 2 = 6400\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe there's a formula I can use instead of multiplying repeatedly.\n\nI recall that for exponential growth, the formula is:\n\n\\[ N = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the final amount\n\n- \\( N_0 \\) is the initial amount\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time elapsed\n\n- \\( T \\) is the doubling time\n\nIn this case, \\( N_0 = 100 \\), \\( t = 6 \\) hours, and \\( T = 1 \\) hour.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ N = 100 \\times 2^{(6/1)} = 100 \\times 2^6 \\]\n\nI know that \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), so:\n\n\\[ N = 100 \\times 64 = 6400 \\]\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier by multiplying repeatedly.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's verify with smaller times to see if it makes sense.\n\nFor example, after 1 hour:\n\n\\[ N = 100 \\times 2^{(1/1)} = 100 \\times 2 = 200 \\]\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n\n\\[ N = 100 \\times 2^{(2/1)} = 100 \\times 4 = 400 \\]\n\nYes, that matches my initial multiplication approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using exponential functions. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ N = N_0 \\times e^{(kt)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( k \\) is the growth rate\n\nBut in this case, since it's doubling every hour, using the first formula is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of geometric sequences, where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Here, the common ratio is 2, and the number of terms is 6 (for 6 hours).\n\nSo, the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)} \\]\n\nBut in this context, since the initial amount is at time t=0, and it doubles every hour, it's better to use the exponential growth formula.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors to consider, like limited resources or carrying capacity, but the problem doesn't mention any constraints, so I can assume unlimited growth for this scenario.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent: time is in hours, and the doubling time is also in hours, so that's fine.\n\nSo, after 6 hours, the population should be:\n\n\\[ N = 100 \\times 2^6 = 100 \\times 64 = 6400 \\]\n\nTherefore, there will be 6,400 bacteria after 6 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6400} \\]"
