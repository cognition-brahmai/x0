        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 units each day, and it works 6 days a week, taking one day off. We need to find out how many units it produces in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many units are produced in one week. Since it produces 1000 units per day and works 6 days a week, we can multiply 1000 by 6.\n\n1000 units/day * 6 days/week = 6000 units/week\n\nNow, to find out the production for 4 weeks, we'll multiply the weekly production by 4.\n\n6000 units/week * 4 weeks = 24,000 units\n\nSo, the factory produces 24,000 units in 4 weeks.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, since there are 7 days in a week and they take one day off, that's indeed 6 working days. And 1000 units per day for 6 days is 6000 per week.\n\nOver 4 weeks, multiplying by 4 gives 24,000. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the total number of working days in 4 weeks, it would be 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 working days.\n\nThen, 1000 units/day * 24 days = 24,000 units.\n\nSame answer again. So, I'm confident that 24,000 units is the correct total production over 4 weeks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]"
