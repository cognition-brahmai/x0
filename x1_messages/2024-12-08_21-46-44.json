        "content": "So there are 12 boys and 8 girls in the class, making a total of 20 students. If one student is selected randomly to be the class representative, I need to find the probability that the chosen student is a girl.\n\nProbability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is selecting a girl, and the total possible outcomes are selecting any student from the class.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of girls, which is 8. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of students, which is 12 boys plus 8 girls, equaling 20 students.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the chosen student is a girl is 8/20. This can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4, which gives 2/5.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/5 or 0.4, which is equivalent to 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
