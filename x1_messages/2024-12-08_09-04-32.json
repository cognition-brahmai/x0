        "content": "Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. So, we have three boxes labeled \"Apples,\" \"Oranges,\" and \"Mixed,\" but all the labels are incorrect. That's a key point: none of the boxes contain what their labels say.\n\nI need to figure out what's in each box based on the fact that when I pick a fruit from the \"Mixed\" box, I get an apple. Okay, let's start by understanding what the \"Mixed\" box actually contains.\n\nSince the label says \"Mixed\" but it's incorrect, the box can't contain a mix of apples and oranges. So, it must contain either only apples or only oranges. I picked an apple from it, so it can't be the box with only oranges. Therefore, the \"Mixed\" box actually contains only apples.\n\nNow, let's look at the other two boxes: \"Apples\" and \"Oranges.\" Again, their labels are incorrect.\n\n- The \"Apples\" box can't contain apples, because the label is wrong.\n\n- The \"Oranges\" box can't contain oranges, for the same reason.\n\nSo, the \"Apples\" box must contain either oranges or a mix, and the \"Oranges\" box must contain either apples or a mix.\n\nBut wait a minute, we already determined that the \"Mixed\" box contains only apples. So, the only options left for the other two boxes are:\n\n- One contains only oranges.\n\n- The other contains a mix of apples and oranges.\n\nBut hold on, since the \"Apples\" box can't contain apples, it must contain either only oranges or the mix. Similarly, the \"Oranges\" box can't contain oranges, so it must contain either only apples or the mix.\n\nHmm, but we've already established that the \"Mixed\" box contains only apples, so the \"Oranges\" box can't contain only apples (because that would be incorrect), so it must contain the mix. And then the \"Apples\" box must contain only oranges.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- \"Mixed\" box actually contains only apples.\n\n- \"Apples\" box can't contain apples, so it must contain either only oranges or the mix.\n\n- \"Oranges\" box can't contain oranges, so it must contain either only apples or the mix.\n\nBut since the \"Mixed\" box is already only apples, the \"Oranges\" box can't be only apples, so it must be the mix. Therefore, the \"Apples\" box must contain only oranges.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- \"Mixed\" box: only apples\n\n- \"Apples\" box: only oranges\n\n- \"Oranges\" box: mix of apples and oranges\n\nLet me double-check this.\n\nIf the \"Mixed\" box contains only apples, and the \"Apples\" box contains only oranges, and the \"Oranges\" box contains the mix, then all labels are indeed incorrect, which matches the initial condition.\n\nAlso, when I pick a fruit from the \"Mixed\" box and get an apple, that makes sense because it actually contains only apples.\n\nSo, I think this is the correct configuration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The \"Mixed\" box contains only apples, the \"Apples\" box contains only oranges, and the \"Oranges\" box contains a mix of apples and oranges.}} \\]"
