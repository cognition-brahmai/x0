Because the order in which we pick the books doesn't matter; it's just about which books are chosen.\n\nI remember that in combinations, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which means the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10 - 3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3! \\times 7!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate the factorials. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\), but actually, since the \\( 7! \\) in the denominator will cancel out the \\( 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\) in the numerator, I can simplify this step.\n\nSo, \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7! \\), and the \\( 7! \\) cancels out with the \\( 7! \\) in the denominator.\n\nTherefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3!} = \\frac{720}{6}\n\\]\n\nWait, no. Let's double-check that. \\( 3! = 6 \\), and \\( 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720 \\), so \\( 720 / 6 = 120 \\).\n\nSo, there are 120 unique combinations of 3 books from a shelf of 10 different books.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about another way to approach this. Maybe using permutations first and then adjusting for the fact that order doesn't matter.\n\nThe number of permutations of 10 books taken 3 at a time would be:\n\n\\[\nP(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{(10 - 3)!} = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720\n\\]\n\nNow, since in combinations the order doesn't matter, each unique combination of 3 books can be arranged in \\( 3! = 6 \\) different ways. Therefore, to find the number of unique combinations, we divide the number of permutations by \\( 3! \\):\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{P(10, 3)}{3!} = \\frac{720}{6} = 120\n\\]\n\nThis matches the earlier result, so I'm confident that 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for the first book, there are 10 choices, for the second book, there are 9 remaining choices, and for the third book, there are 8 remaining choices. So, again, that's \\( 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720 \\) permutations. But since the order doesn't matter in combinations, we divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 books, which is \\( 3! = 6 \\), resulting in \\( 720 / 6 = 120 \\).\n\nThis consistency across different methods reinforces that the answer is indeed 120.\n\nJust to explore further, what if the books were identical, would that change anything? No, because the problem states \"10 different books,\" so each book is unique.\n\nAlso, there's no mention of any restrictions, like\u4e0d\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e66\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u4e66\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7531\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\n\n\u518d\u8005\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u9898\u76ee\u95ee\u7684\u662f\u6392\u5217\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u7b54\u6848\u5c31\u662f\u4e4b\u524d\u7684720\uff0c\u4f46\u9898\u76ee\u660e\u786e\u662f\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5120\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bd5\u7740\u624b\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u4e9b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u67094\u672c\u4e66\u4e2d\u90092\u672c\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u662fC(4,2)=6\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\uff1aAB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD\u3002\n\n\u540c\u6837\u5730\uff0cC(10,3)=120\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e5f\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9012\u63a8\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982C(n,k)=C(n-1,k)+C(n-1,k-1)\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u60f3\u6df1\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e2a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n\n\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece10\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e66\u4e2d\u9009\u62e93\u672c\u7684 unique combinations \u6570\u91cf\u662f120\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
