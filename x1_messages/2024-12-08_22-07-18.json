        "content": "So the restaurant wants to add outdoor patio seating to increase its seating capacity. They can fit up to 20 tables, and each table seats four people. That sounds like a nice expansion. But there are some costs involved, and they need to know how much all this is going to set them back. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are the tables and chairs. Each table costs $300, and each chair costs $75. Since each table seats four people, that means each table needs four chairs. So, for 20 tables, they'll need 20 times four, which is 80 chairs.\n\nLet's calculate the cost for the tables:\n\n20 tables * $300 per table = $6,000.\n\nNow, for the chairs:\n\n80 chairs * $75 per chair = $6,000.\n\nSo, the total for tables and chairs is $6,000 + $6,000 = $12,000.\n\nNext, they need to invest in outdoor heaters. The heaters cost $500 each, and they need one heater for every two tables. So, with 20 tables, they'll need 20 divided by 2, which is 10 heaters.\n\nCost for heaters:\n\n10 heaters * $500 per heater = $5,000.\n\nThen, there are the umbrellas. Each umbrella costs $150, and they need one umbrella for every four tables. So, with 20 tables, they'll need 20 divided by 4, which is 5 umbrellas.\n\nCost for umbrellas:\n\n5 umbrellas * $150 per umbrella = $750.\n\nNow, to find the total investment required, we'll add up all these costs:\n\nTables: $6,000\n\nChairs: $6,000\n\nHeaters: $5,000\n\nUmbrellas: $750\n\nTotal investment = $6,000 + $6,000 + $5,000 + $750 = $17,750.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n$6,000 (tables) + $6,000 (chairs) = $12,000\n\n$12,000 + $5,000 (heaters) = $17,000\n\n$17,000 + $750 (umbrellas) = $17,750.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total investment required for the outdoor patio expansion is $17,750.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider if there are any other costs involved that aren't mentioned here. For example, permits, installation, maintenance, or perhaps landscaping for the patio area. However, since the question only mentions the costs of tables, chairs, heaters, and umbrellas, I'll stick to those for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they need to factor in the cost of patio flooring or lighting, but again, since these aren't mentioned, I won't include them in the calculation.\n\nIt's also possible that some of these items come in sets or may have bulk discounts, but without specific information about that, I'll assume that the given prices are per item without any discounts.\n\nSo, based on the provided information, the total investment is $17,750.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's verify the number of heaters and umbrellas again.\n\nHeaters: one for every two tables.\n\n20 tables / 2 = 10 heaters.\n\nUmbrellas: one for every four tables.\n\n20 tables / 4 = 5 umbrellas.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlso, confirming the cost per item:\n\nTable: $300\n\nChair: $75\n\nHeater: $500\n\nUmbrella: $150\n\nAnd the quantities:\n\nTables: 20\n\nChairs: 80\n\nHeaters: 10\n\nUmbrellas: 5\n\nMultiplying these gives:\n\nTables: 20 * $300 = $6,000\n\nChairs: 80 * $75 = $6,000\n\nHeaters: 10 * $500 = $5,000\n\nUmbrellas: 5 * $150 = $750\n\nTotal: $17,750.\n\nI think that's the correct total investment required for the outdoor patio expansion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17750} \\]"
