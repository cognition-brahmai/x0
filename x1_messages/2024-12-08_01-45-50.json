        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a cruise ship itinerary. There are three ships with different capacities: 1,500, 2,000, and 3,000 passengers. They're looking to offer cruises to five different destinations, each with their own port fees, travel distances, and expected ticket sales. The goal is to figure out the best combination of ships and destinations to maximize profits while minimizing operational costs. Hmm, sounds like a optimization problem. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have three ships and five destinations. Presumably, each ship can be assigned to only one destination per cruise, unless they're doing multiple cruises, but the problem doesn't specify that. For now, I'll assume that each ship is assigned to one destination for the season. But maybe they can be reassigned for different cruises within the season. Hmm, I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"itinerary for the upcoming season.\" Maybe each ship will have a schedule of multiple cruises, visiting different destinations throughout the season. But the way it's phrased, it seems like they're deciding which ship goes to which destination for the season. Or perhaps they're planning a single cruise per ship. I need to make an assumption here. Let's assume that each ship is assigned to one destination for the season, and they'll be doing multiple cruises to that destination.\n\nBut actually, cruises typically visit multiple destinations in one cruise, but the problem mentions \"five different destinations.\" Maybe the cruises are to different sets of destinations, and each ship is assigned to a particular itinerary. For example, Ship A might do a Caribbean itinerary, Ship B does an Alaskan itinerary, and Ship C does a European itinerary, each with their own set of five destinations. But the problem seems to suggest that there are five distinct destinations, and they need to assign ships to them.\n\nWait, maybe it's that there are five possible destinations, and each ship can be assigned to one of these destinations for their cruise itinerary. But with three ships and five destinations, not all destinations will have a ship assigned, or perhaps some ships will be assigned to the same destination but different itineraries.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me try rephrasing the problem. There are three cruise ships with capacities of 1,500, 2,000, and 3,000 passengers. There are five destinations, each with varying port fees, travel distances, and expected ticket sales. The company wants to maximize profits while minimizing operational costs by optimally assigning ships to destinations.\n\nI think the key here is to match the ship's capacity with the expected demand at each destination, considering the costs associated with each destination.\n\nFirst, I need data on the expected ticket sales for each destination. Presumably, this would give an idea of how many passengers are expected to book tickets for each destination. Then, I need to match the ship's capacity with the expected demand.\n\nBut also, there are port fees and travel distances to consider, which likely affect the operational costs.\n\nSo, for each destination, there are:\n\n- Expected ticket sales (probably in terms of number of tickets or revenue)\n\n- Port fees\n\n- Travel distances\n\nAnd for each ship, there's a capacity in terms of passengers.\n\nMy goal is to assign ships to destinations in a way that maximizes profit, which is revenue from ticket sales minus operational costs (including port fees and costs associated with travel distances).\n\nFirst, I need to estimate the revenue for each ship-destination combination.\n\nAssuming that the expected ticket sales are given in terms of revenue, I can use that directly. But if it's in terms of number of tickets, I'd need to know the average ticket price to calculate revenue.\n\nWait, the problem says \"expected ticket sales,\" which could be in terms of revenue or number of tickets. It's a bit ambiguous. I'll assume it's in terms of revenue.\n\nNext, operational costs include port fees and costs related to travel distances.\n\nI need to know the cost per unit distance for each ship, but that information isn't provided. Maybe I need to assume that cost is proportional to distance, and port fees are fixed per destination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps operational cost is a function of both distance and ship size. Larger ships might have higher operational costs due to more fuel consumption.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should simplify it.\n\nLet's assume that for each ship-destination pair, there is a profit figure which is revenue minus costs.\n\nI need to calculate or estimate this profit for each possible assignment.\n\nGiven that there are three ships and five destinations, there are 3*5=15 possible assignments.\n\nBut since ships can't be assigned to multiple destinations simultaneously, and there are only three ships, only three assignments can be made.\n\nWait, but if ships are assigned to different itineraries within the season, maybe multiple ships can be assigned to the same destination, but that seems unlikely.\n\nI think each ship is assigned to one destination for the season.\n\nSo, need to choose three out of five destinations to assign the ships to, and decide which ship goes to which destination.\n\nBut, perhaps some destinations are more popular and can handle more passengers, so maybe assigning the larger ship to a more popular destination would be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some destinations have capacity limits, so you can't send a ship with 3,000 passengers if the port can only handle, say, 2,000.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so I'll assume that any ship can be sent to any destination.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. List all possible ship-destination assignments.\n\n2. For each assignment, calculate the profit: revenue from ticket sales minus operational costs.\n\n3. Select the three assignments that maximize total profit, ensuring that each ship is assigned to only one destination.\n\nThis sounds like a linear programming problem or, more specifically, an assignment problem.\n\nIn assignment problems, we have a set of agents (ships) and a set of tasks (destinations), and we want to assign agents to tasks in a way that maximizes some objective function (profit).\n\nGiven that, I can represent this as a matrix where rows are ships and columns are destinations, and each cell contains the profit for assigning that ship to that destination.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to selecting one destination for each ship such that no two ships are assigned to the same destination (since assigning multiple ships to the same destination might not make sense, unless they are operating at different times).\n\nBut, perhaps it's allowed to assign multiple ships to the same destination if they operate on different cruises.\n\nWait, the problem says \"offer cruises to five different destinations,\" but there are only three ships. So, probably each ship is assigned to one destination, and some destinations will not be served.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some ships can be assigned to serve multiple destinations in their itinerary.\n\nThis is getting too vague. I need to make an assumption here.\n\nLet me assume that each ship is assigned to one destination for the season, and each destination can have at most one ship assigned to it.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose which three destinations to serve and which ship to assign to each.\n\nTo proceed, I need data on:\n\n- Expected ticket sales revenue for each destination.\n\n- Port fees for each destination.\n\n- Travel distances for each destination.\n\n- Possibly, operational costs per mile for each ship.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide specific numbers, so I need to think conceptually.\n\nLet's assume that the profit for assigning ship S to destination D is:\n\nProfit(S,D) = Revenue(D) - (Port Fees(D) + Operational Costs(S,D))\n\nWhere Operational Costs(S,D) is a function of the ship's size and the distance to the destination.\n\nPerhaps operational costs are proportional to the distance and the ship's size, since larger ships consume more fuel.\n\nSo, Operational Costs(S,D) = Cost_per_mile(S) * Distance(D)\n\nWhere Cost_per_mile(S) is specific to each ship.\n\nBut without specific values, I can't calculate exact profits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to prioritize assigning ships to destinations based on certain criteria.\n\nFor example, assign the largest ship to the destination with the highest expected revenue, provided that the destination can handle the ship's capacity.\n\nBut again, without capacity constraints for destinations, I'll assume that any ship can go to any destination.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the profit per passenger for each ship-destination pair and prioritize assignments based on that.\n\nWait, but ships have different capacities, so maximizing profit per passenger might not lead to maximum total profit.\n\nBetter to focus on total profit.\n\nLet me try to outline a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. For each destination, determine the expected revenue from ticket sales.\n\n2. For each destination, note the port fees.\n\n3. For each destination, note the travel distance.\n\n4. For each ship, estimate the operational costs based on the travel distance and the ship's specifications.\n\n5. For each ship-destination pair, calculate the profit as Revenue(D) - (Port Fees(D) + Operational Costs(S,D))\n\n6. Create a matrix of profits for each ship-destination pair.\n\n7. Solve the assignment problem to select three ship-destination assignments that maximize total profit, ensuring that each ship is assigned to only one destination and each destination is assigned to only one ship.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan, but again, without specific numbers, I can't proceed further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider other factors, such as the popularity of destinations or the efficiency of ship sizes.\n\nLet me think about ship sizes.\n\nThe ships have capacities of 1,500, 2,000, and 3,000 passengers.\n\nAssuming that the expected ticket sales for each destination are in terms of number of tickets, I could match the ship's capacity to the expected demand.\n\nFor example, if a destination is expected to have high demand, say 3,000 passengers, then assigning the 3,000-passenger ship would be ideal.\n\nSimilarly, if a destination has lower demand, say 1,500 passengers, assigning the 1,500-passenger ship would be more efficient.\n\nBut if the expected demand is higher than the ship's capacity, then either multiple ships need to be assigned or the demand is not fully met.\n\nBut in our earlier assumption, each ship is assigned to one destination for the season.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to match ship capacities with expected demand to maximize utilization.\n\nMoreover, larger ships might have higher operational costs, so even if a destination has high demand, if the operational costs are too high, it might not be profitable.\n\nAlternatively, a larger ship might be assigned to a destination with higher ticket prices, offsetting the higher operational costs.\n\nThis is getting complex without specific data.\n\nPerhaps I should consider an example to illustrate the process.\n\nLet's assume the following hypothetical data:\n\nDestinations: A, B, C, D, E\n\nExpected ticket sales (revenue): A-$5M, B-$6M, C-$4M, D-$7M, E-$5.5M\n\nPort fees: A-$1M, B-$1.2M, C-$0.8M, D-$1.5M, E-$1.3M\n\nTravel distances: A-1000 miles, B-1200 miles, C-900 miles, D-1500 miles, E-1400 miles\n\nOperational costs per mile:\n\n- Ship 1 (1500 passengers): $0.5 per mile per passenger\n\n- Ship 2 (2000 passengers): $0.6 per mile per passenger\n\n- Ship 3 (3000 passengers): $0.7 per mile per passenger\n\nWait, that might be too high. Maybe it's better to have operational costs per mile per ship, not per passenger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps operational costs are based on the ship's size and the distance.\n\nLet me adjust that.\n\nAssume operational costs per mile:\n\n- Ship 1: $1,000 per mile\n\n- Ship 2: $1,200 per mile\n\n- Ship 3: $1,500 per mile\n\nThis seems more reasonable.\n\nNow, for each ship-destination pair, operational costs would be:\n\nOperational Costs(S,D) = Operational cost per mile for ship S * Distance for destination D\n\nThen, profit for each ship-destination pair would be:\n\nProfit(S,D) = Revenue(D) - (Port Fees(D) + Operational Costs(S,D))\n\nNow, let's calculate the profits for each ship-destination pair.\n\nFirst, Ship 1:\n\nDestination A: $5M - ($1M + $1,000/mile * 1000 miles) = $5M - $1M - $1,000,000 = $3M\n\nDestination B: $6M - ($1.2M + $1,000/mile * 1200 miles) = $6M - $1.2M - $1.2M = $3.6M\n\nDestination C: $4M - ($0.8M + $1,000/mile * 900 miles) = $4M - $0.8M - $0.9M = $2.3M\n\nDestination D: $7M - ($1.5M + $1,000/mile * 1500 miles) = $7M - $1.5M - $1.5M = $4M\n\nDestination E: $5.5M - ($1.3M + $1,000/mile * 1400 miles) = $5.5M - $1.3M - $1.4M = $2.8M\n\nSimilarly, for Ship 2:\n\nDestination A: $5M - ($1M + $1,200/mile * 1000 miles) = $5M - $1M - $1.2M = $2.8M\n\nDestination B: $6M - ($1.2M + $1,200/mile * 1200 miles) = $6M - $1.2M - $1.44M = $3.36M\n\nDestination C: $4M - ($0.8M + $1,200/mile * 900 miles) = $4M - $0.8M - $1.08M = $2.12M\n\nDestination D: $7M - ($1.5M + $1,200/mile * 1500 miles) = $7M - $1.5M - $1.8M = $3.7M\n\nDestination E: $5.5M - ($1.3M + $1,200/mile * 1400 miles) = $5.5M - $1.3M - $1.68M = $2.52M\n\nAnd for Ship 3:\n\nDestination A: $5M - ($1M + $1,500/mile * 1000 miles) = $5M - $1M - $1.5M = $2.5M\n\nDestination B: $6M - ($1.2M + $1,500/mile * 1200 miles) = $6M - $1.2M - $1.8M = $3M\n\nDestination C: $4M - ($0.8M + $1,500/mile * 900 miles) = $4M - $0.8M - $1.35M = $1.85M\n\nDestination D: $7M - ($1.5M + $1,500/mile * 1500 miles) = $7M - $1.5M - $2.25M = $3.25M\n\nDestination E: $5.5M - ($1.3M + $1,500/mile * 1400 miles) = $5.5M - $1.3M - $2.1M = $2.1M\n\nNow, I have a matrix of profits for each ship-destination pair.\n\nNext, I need to select one destination for each ship such that the total profit is maximized, and no two ships are assigned to the same destination.\n\nThis is a classic assignment problem, which can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm or linear programming.\n\nBut since there are only three ships and five destinations, it's manageable to consider all possible assignments.\n\nFirst, list all possible assignments:\n\nAssign Ship 1 to Destination A, Ship 2 to B, Ship 3 to C\n\nAssign Ship 1 to A, Ship 2 to B, Ship 3 to D\n\nAssign Ship 1 to A, Ship 2 to B, Ship 3 to E\n\nAnd so on, ensuring that no two ships are assigned to the same destination.\n\nThere are 5 choose 3 assignments, which is 10 possible combinations.\n\nFor each combination, calculate the total profit.\n\nThen, select the combination with the highest total profit.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. Ship1-A ($3M), Ship2-B ($3.36M), Ship3-C ($1.85M): Total = $8.21M\n\n2. Ship1-A ($3M), Ship2-B ($3.36M), Ship3-D ($3.25M): Total = $9.61M\n\n3. Ship1-A ($3M), Ship2-B ($3.36M), Ship3-E ($2.1M): Total = $8.46M\n\n4. Ship1-A ($3M), Ship2-C ($2.12M), Ship3-D ($3.25M): Total = $8.37M\n\n5. Ship1-A ($3M), Ship2-C ($2.12M), Ship3-E ($2.1M): Total = $7.22M\n\n6. Ship1-B ($3.6M), Ship2-C ($2.12M), Ship3-D ($3.25M): Total = $8.97M\n\n7. Ship1-B ($3.6M), Ship2-C ($2.12M), Ship3-E ($2.1M): Total = $7.82M\n\n8. Ship1-B ($3.6M), Ship2-D ($3.7M), Ship3-E ($2.1M): Total = $9.4M\n\n9. Ship1-C ($2.3M), Ship2-D ($3.7M), Ship3-E ($2.1M): Total = $8.1M\n\n10. Ship1-C ($2.3M), Ship2-E ($2.52M), Ship3-D ($3.25M): Total = $8.07M\n\nLooking at these totals, the highest total profit is $9.61M from assignment 2: Ship1-A, Ship2-B, Ship3-D.\n\nAlternatively, assignment 8 has $9.4M: Ship1-B, Ship2-D, Ship3-E.\n\nBut $9.61M is higher.\n\nWait, but in assignment 2, Ship3 is assigned to D with a profit of $3.25M, while Ship2 to B has $3.36M, and Ship1 to A has $3M, totaling $9.56M.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, in my earlier calculation for Ship3-D, I have $3.25M, Ship2-B has $3.36M, and Ship1-A has $3M, totaling $9.56M, not $9.61M. Maybe I made a mistake in addition.\n\nSimilarly, for assignment 8: Ship1-B ($3.6M), Ship2-D ($3.7M), Ship3-E ($2.1M), totaling $9.4M.\n\nSo, assignment 2 gives $9.56M, and assignment 8 gives $9.4M.\n\nTherefore, assignment 2 is better.\n\nBut let's check if there are other assignments that could yield higher profits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider assigning Ship1 to D, which has $4M, Ship2 to B with $3.36M, and Ship3 to A with $2.5M, totaling $9.86M.\n\nBut in this case, Ship1 is assigned to D, Ship2 to B, and Ship3 to A, which is allowed since all destinations are different.\n\nWait, in my earlier list, I only considered assignments where Ship1 is assigned to A, B, C, etc., in order, but perhaps I need to consider all possible permutations.\n\nYes, I need to consider all possible ways to assign three destinations to three ships.\n\nSo, the number of possible assignments is P(5,3) = 60, not just 10.\n\nWait, no. If I have three ships and five destinations, and each ship is assigned to a different destination, then it's indeed P(5,3) = 60 possible assignments.\n\nBut that's a lot to list out manually.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider that this is an assignment problem where we have more tasks (destinations) than agents (ships), and we need to assign each agent to one task, maximizing total profit.\n\nIn such cases, the Hungarian algorithm can still be applied by introducing dummy agents or tasks as needed.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of ships is less than the number of destinations, perhaps some destinations won't be served.\n\nIn standard assignment problems, the number of agents equals the number of tasks, but in this case, it's unbalanced.\n\nHowever, in our earlier approach, we considered selecting three destinations to assign to the three ships, maximizing the total profit.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to select the three ship-destination pairs with the highest profits, ensuring that each ship is assigned to only one destination and each destination is assigned to only one ship.\n\nIn other words, find the assignment that maximizes the sum of the selected profits, with each ship and each destination appearing only once in the assignment.\n\nThis is exactly what the assignment problem solves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look for the assignment that maximizes the total profit.\n\nIn the example above, I initially calculated some assignments and found that assigning Ship1 to A, Ship2 to B, and Ship3 to D gives a total profit of $9.56M.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination.\n\nLet me consider assigning Ship1 to D ($4M), Ship2 to B ($3.36M), and Ship3 to A ($2.5M), totaling $9.86M, which is higher than $9.56M.\n\nWait, but in this assignment, Ship3 is assigned to A, which has a lower profit for Ship3 compared to Ship1 assigned to A.\n\nBut in this combination, the total is higher.\n\nAlternatively, assign Ship1 to D ($4M), Ship2 to A ($2.8M), Ship3 to B ($3M), totaling $9.8M.\n\nWait, but Ship3 to B has $3M, which is less than Ship2 to B's $3.36M.\n\nIt seems that assigning Ship2 to B yields higher profit than Ship3 to B.\n\nWait, perhaps assigning Ship1 to D ($4M), Ship2 to B ($3.36M), and Ship3 to E ($2.1M), totaling $9.46M.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of assigning Ship1 to D, Ship2 to B, and Ship3 to A, which is $4M + $3.36M + $2.5M = $9.86M.\n\nWait, but in that case, Ship3 to A has $2.5M, which is less than Ship1 to A's $3M.\n\nBut Ship1 to D has $4M, which is higher than Ship1 to A's $3M.\n\nSimilarly, Ship2 to B has $3.36M.\n\nSo, perhaps assigning Ship1 to D, Ship2 to B, and Ship3 to C, which is $4M + $3.36M + $1.85M = $9.21M, which is less than $9.86M.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider assigning Ship1 to D ($4M), Ship2 to A ($2.8M), and Ship3 to B ($3M), totaling $9.8M.\n\nBut Ship2 to A has $2.8M, which is less than Ship2 to B's $3.36M.\n\nAlternatively, assign Ship1 to D ($4M), Ship2 to C ($2.12M), and Ship3 to B ($3M), totaling $9.12M.\n\nNot as good.\n\nAlternatively, assign Ship1 to B ($3.6M), Ship2 to D ($3.7M), Ship3 to A ($2.5M), totaling $9.8M.\n\nThis is similar to earlier.\n\nIt seems that assigning Ship1 to D ($4M), Ship2 to B ($3.36M), and Ship3 to A ($2.5M) gives $9.86M, which is higher than assigning Ship1 to A ($3M), Ship2 to B ($3.36M), and Ship3 to D ($3.25M), which is $9.61M.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in earlier calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nShip1 to D: $4M\n\nShip2 to B: $3.36M\n\nShip3 to A: $2.5M\n\nTotal: $4M + $3.36M + $2.5M = $9.86M\n\nAlternatively, Ship1 to A: $3M\n\nShip2 to B: $3.36M\n\nShip3 to D: $3.25M\n\nTotal: $3M + $3.36M + $3.25M = $9.61M\n\nYes, $9.86M is higher.\n\nSimilarly, Ship1 to B: $3.6M\n\nShip2 to D: $3.7M\n\nShip3 to A: $2.5M\n\nTotal: $3.6M + $3.7M + $2.5M = $9.8M\n\nStill less than $9.86M.\n\nAlternatively, Ship1 to D: $4M\n\nShip2 to A: $2.8M\n\nShip3 to B: $3M\n\nTotal: $4M + $2.8M + $3M = $9.8M\n\nStill less than $9.86M.\n\nAlternatively, Ship1 to D: $4M\n\nShip2 to E: $2.52M\n\nShip3 to B: $3M\n\nTotal: $4M + $2.52M + $3M = $9.52M\n\nNot as good.\n\nAlternatively, Ship1 to C: $2.3M\n\nShip2 to D: $3.7M\n\nShip3 to A: $2.5M\n\nTotal: $2.3M + $3.7M + $2.5M = $8.5M\n\nNot as good.\n\nAlternatively, Ship1 to E: $2.8M\n\nShip2 to B: $3.36M\n\nShip3 to D: $3.25M\n\nTotal: $2.8M + $3.36M + $3.25M = $9.41M\n\nNot as good as $9.86M.\n\nSo, the best assignment seems to be Ship1 to D, Ship2 to B, Ship3 to A, with a total profit of $9.86M.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to get even higher total profit?\n\nLet me check if there are any other assignments.\n\nWhat if I assign Ship1 to D ($4M), Ship2 to C ($2.12M), Ship3 to E ($2.1M), totaling $8.22M, which is less than $9.86M.\n\nAlternatively, Ship1 to D ($4M), Ship2 to A ($2.8M), Ship3 to B ($3M), totaling $9.8M.\n\nStill less than $9.86M.\n\nAlternatively, Ship1 to B ($3.6M), Ship2 to D ($3.7M), Ship3 to A ($2.5M), totaling $9.8M.\n\nSame as above.\n\nSo, the best assignment seems to be Ship1 to D, Ship2 to B, Ship3 to A, with a total profit of $9.86M.\n\nTherefore, the optimal combination is:\n\n- Ship1 (3000 passengers) to Destination D, with a profit of $4M\n\n- Ship2 (2000 passengers) to Destination B, with a profit of $3.36M\n\n- Ship3 (1500 passengers) to Destination A, with a profit of $2.5M\n\nTotal profit: $9.86M\n\nBut wait, is there a reason to prefer this combination over others?\n\nIn particular, assigning the largest ship to the destination with the highest profit per ship seems logical.\n\nDestination D has the highest revenue ($7M) and, with Ship1, yields $4M profit.\n\nShip2 to B yields $3.36M, and Ship3 to A yields $2.5M.\n\nAlternatively, assigning Ship3 to D would yield $3.25M, which is less than $4M with Ship1.\n\nSimilarly, assigning Ship1 to D seems to maximize profit for that ship.\n\nTherefore, this assignment seems optimal.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any constraint on the number of passengers per destination.\n\nIf Destination A can only handle up to 1,500 passengers, then assigning Ship3 to A would be overcapacity.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any capacity constraints for destinations, so I'll assume that any ship can be assigned to any destination.\n\nAlternatively, if destinations have minimum passenger requirements, that could affect the assignment.\n\nBut again, no such information is provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the hypothetical data and the calculations, the optimal assignment is Ship1 to D, Ship2 to B, and Ship3 to A.\n\nNow, in reality, the company would need to gather actual data on revenue, port fees, travel distances, and operational costs per mile for each ship to make this calculation.\n\nAdditionally, other factors may influence the decision, such as:\n\n- Seasonal demand fluctuations\n\n- Competitor presence in certain destinations\n\n- Passenger preferences for certain ship sizes\n\n- Maintenance schedules for the ships\n\n- Crew availability\n\n- Environmental regulations in certain destinations\n\n- And so on.\n\nBut given the information provided and the assumptions made, the above assignment seems optimal.\n\nIn conclusion, to maximize profits while minimizing operational costs, the cruise ship company should assign their 3,000-passenger ship to Destination D, the 2,000-passenger ship to Destination B, and the 1,500-passenger ship to Destination A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Assign the 3,000-passenger ship to Destination D, the 2,000-passenger ship to Destination B, and the 1,500-passenger ship to Destination A.}}"
