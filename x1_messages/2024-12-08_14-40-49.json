        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if it takes 6 hours for 8 workers to paint a house, how long would it take for 12 workers to paint the same house, assuming they all work at the same pace? Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time it takes to complete the job. I think this is a case of inverse proportion, where if you have more workers, it should take less time to finish the job, assuming they all work at the same rate.\n\nSo, if 8 workers take 6 hours, then increasing the number of workers to 12 should decrease the time required. But how do I calculate exactly how much time it would take?\n\nMaybe I can start by figuring out the total amount of work done, in terms of worker-hours. If 8 workers take 6 hours, then the total work is 8 workers * 6 hours = 48 worker-hours. So, the job requires 48 worker-hours to complete.\n\nNow, if I have 12 workers, I can find out how many hours it would take for them to complete the same 48 worker-hours of work. Let's let t be the time in hours. So, 12 workers * t hours = 48 worker-hours.\n\nSolving for t, t = 48 worker-hours / 12 workers = 4 hours.\n\nSo, it would take 12 workers 4 hours to paint the house.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's check. If 8 workers take 6 hours, and 12 is 50% more workers, then the time should be reduced by the same proportion. Let's see: increasing workers by 50% should decrease time by about 33.3%, because time is inversely proportional to the number of workers.\n\nSo, 6 hours divided by 1.5 (which is the factor by which workers increased) is 4 hours. Yeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the work rate per worker. If 8 workers take 6 hours, then each worker is contributing 1/8 of the work per hour. Wait, no, that might not be the best way.\n\nActually, the work rate per worker is the fraction of the house painted per hour. So, if 8 workers together paint the house in 6 hours, their combined work rate is 1 house per 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, the work rate for 8 workers is 1/6 of the house per hour.\n\nThen, the work rate per worker is (1/6)/8 = 1/48 of the house per hour.\n\nNow, if you have 12 workers, each working at 1/48 of the house per hour, their combined work rate is 12 * 1/48 = 12/48 = 1/4 of the house per hour.\n\nSo, if they can paint 1/4 of the house per hour, then to paint the whole house, it would take 1 / (1/4) = 4 hours.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. If 8 workers take 6 hours, and I want to find out for 12 workers, I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet\u2019s set up the equation: workers * hours = constant work done.\n\nSo, 8 workers * 6 hours = 12 workers * t hours.\n\nTherefore, 48 = 12t.\n\nSolving for t, t = 48 / 12 = 4 hours.\n\nSame answer again. Seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of man-hours. The total effort required to paint the house is 48 man-hours.\n\nWith 12 workers, the time required is total man-hours divided by the number of workers, which is 48 / 12 = 4 hours.\n\nAlright, I\u2019m convinced. It would take 12 workers 4 hours to paint the house.\n\nJust to make sure, let\u2019s consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. Are there any constraints, like if the house is too small and adding more workers might get in each other's way? But the problem assumes that all workers work at the same pace and there are no such constraints, so the calculation should hold.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the unit of time is consistent. The original time is in hours, and the answer is also in hours, so that\u2019s fine.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
