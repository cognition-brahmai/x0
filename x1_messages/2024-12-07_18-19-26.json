        "content": "So I have this garden that's 20 feet by 30 feet, and I want to plant flowers everywhere, but specifically, I want to plant one flower every 2 square feet. I need to figure out how many flowers I'll need in total. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the total area of the garden. Since it's a rectangle, the area should be length times width. So, that's 20 feet times 30 feet. Let me calculate that.\n\n20 feet * 30 feet = 600 square feet.\n\nAlright, so the garden is 600 square feet in total. Now, if I want to plant flowers every 2 square feet, that means each flower is spaced apart in such a way that each one occupies 2 square feet of space.\n\nTo find out how many flowers I need, I should divide the total area by the area each flower occupies. So, that would be 600 square feet divided by 2 square feet per flower.\n\n600 / 2 = 300.\n\nSo, I would need 300 flowers to cover the garden with one flower every 2 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If each flower is spaced 2 square feet apart, and the garden is 600 square feet, then yes, dividing the total area by the area per flower should give me the number of flowers needed.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of how many 2-square-foot areas are there in 600 square feet. Again, that would be 600 divided by 2, which is 300.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I can look at it another way to confirm.\n\nLet's see, if I were to plant flowers in a grid pattern, say, spacing them evenly along the length and the width. The garden is 20 feet by 30 feet.\n\nIf I space them every certain number of feet along the length and width, but I'm given the area per flower, which is 2 square feet, I need to find the spacing that corresponds to that.\n\nBut that might be more complicated than necessary. Since the question is about area, and I've calculated the total area and divided by the area per flower, I think 300 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any wasted space or if the flowers will cover the entire area perfectly. But since I'm planting one flower every 2 square feet across the entire 600-square-foot garden, without any specific constraints on the arrangement, 300 flowers should cover it adequately.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The calculation seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
