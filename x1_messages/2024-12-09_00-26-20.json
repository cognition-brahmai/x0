        "content": "Certainly! Here's a JavaScript function that checks if a number is prime or not:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isPrime(num) {\n  // Numbers less than 2 are not prime\n  if (num < 2) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  \n  // Check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number\n  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {\n    if (num % i === 0) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return true;\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a number as an argument. It will return `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(isPrime(7));  // Output: true\nconsole.log(isPrime(10)); // Output: false\n```\n\nThis function works by checking if the input number is divisible by any number from 2 up to its square root. If it finds any divisor in that range, it concludes that the number is not prime. Otherwise, it's prime.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial Check:** If the number is less than 2, it's not prime.\n2. **Loop for Divisibility:** We loop from 2 up to the square root of the number because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.\n3. **Return Result:** If no divisors are found, the number is prime.\n\nThis approach is efficient for checking primality, especially for larger numbers, as it reduces the number of iterations needed compared to checking all the way up to the number itself."
