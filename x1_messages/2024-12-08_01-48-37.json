        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming subcommittees from a committee of 7 members\u20143 women and 4 men. The condition is that any subcommittee must include at least one woman and at least one man. I need to figure out how many different subcommittees can be formed under these constraints.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what's being asked. We have a group of 7 people: 3 women and 4 men. We need to select a subcommittee from these 7, but it has to include at least one woman and at least one man. So, it can't be all women or all men.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, when dealing with selections or combinations, the total number of ways to choose a subset from a set is given by \\(2^n\\), where n is the number of elements in the set. But here, there are restrictions.\n\nSo, the total number of possible subcommittees without any restrictions would be \\(2^7 = 128\\). That includes the empty subcommittee, which probably doesn't make sense in this context, so maybe it's \\(2^7 - 1 = 127\\). But wait, actually, the problem likely considers subcommittees of any non-zero size, so excluding the empty set is probably correct.\n\nHowever, I need to exclude the subcommittees that are all women or all men.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many subcommittees are all women. There are 3 women, so the number of all-women subcommittees is \\(2^3 - 1 = 7\\). Similarly, the number of all-men subcommittees is \\(2^4 - 1 = 15\\).\n\nWait a minute, but does that include the empty subcommittee in each case? Actually, \\(2^3\\) includes the empty set, so \\(2^3 - 1 = 7\\) excludes the empty set. Similarly for the men, \\(2^4 - 1 = 15\\) excludes the empty set.\n\nBut, in the total of 127 subcommittees, the empty set is already excluded, so I need to subtract the all-women and all-men subcommittees from this total to get the number of subcommittees that include at least one woman and at least one man.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nTotal subcommittees = 127\n\nAll-women subcommittees = 7\n\nAll-men subcommittees = 15\n\nTherefore, subcommittees with at least one woman and one man = 127 - 7 - 15 = 105.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this approach. Is there another way to look at it?\n\nAlternatively, I could think about selecting at least one woman and at least one man directly.\n\nThe total number of ways to select a subcommittee with at least one woman and at least one man can be found using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of non-empty subcommittees: \\(2^7 - 1 = 127\\).\n\nThen, subtract the number of subcommittees with only women or only men.\n\nNumber of subcommittees with only women: \\(2^3 - 1 = 7\\).\n\nNumber of subcommittees with only men: \\(2^4 - 1 = 15\\).\n\nSo, subcommittees that include at least one woman and at least one man are: 127 - 7 - 15 = 105.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to select any combination that includes at least one woman and at least one man.\n\nI could calculate the number of ways to select subcommittees with at least one woman and at least one man by considering the different possible numbers of women and men.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 1 woman and 1 man: \\(C(3,1) \\times C(4,1) = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n\n- 1 woman and 2 men: \\(C(3,1) \\times C(4,2) = 3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n\n- 1 woman and 3 men: \\(C(3,1) \\times C(4,3) = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n\n- 2 women and 1 man: \\(C(3,2) \\times C(4,1) = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n\n- 2 women and 2 men: \\(C(3,2) \\times C(4,2) = 3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n\n- 2 women and 3 men: \\(C(3,2) \\times C(4,3) = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n\n- 3 women and 1 man: \\(C(3,3) \\times C(4,1) = 1 \\times 4 = 4\\)\n\n- 3 women and 2 men: \\(C(3,3) \\times C(4,2) = 1 \\times 6 = 6\\)\n\n- 3 women and 3 men: \\(C(3,3) \\times C(4,3) = 1 \\times 4 = 4\\)\n\nNow, adding all these up: 12 + 18 + 12 + 12 + 18 + 12 + 4 + 6 + 4 = Let's add them step by step:\n\n12 + 18 = 30\n\n30 + 12 = 42\n\n42 + 12 = 54\n\n54 + 18 = 72\n\n72 + 12 = 84\n\n84 + 4 = 88\n\n88 + 6 = 94\n\n94 + 4 = 98\n\nWait, that doesn't match the previous total of 105. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in listing the possibilities. Let's see:\n\nActually, the possible combinations are:\n\n- At least 1 woman and at least 1 man.\n\nSo, the possible combinations in terms of numbers are:\n\n- 1 woman and 1 man\n\n- 1 woman and 2 men\n\n- 1 woman and 3 men\n\n- 1 woman and 4 men\n\n- 2 women and 1 man\n\n- 2 women and 2 men\n\n- 2 women and 3 men\n\n- 3 women and 1 man\n\n- 3 women and 2 men\n\n- 3 women and 3 men\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had:\n\n- 1 woman and 1 man: 12\n\n- 1 woman and 2 men: 18\n\n- 1 woman and 3 men: 12\n\n- 2 women and 1 man: 12\n\n- 2 women and 2 men: 18\n\n- 2 women and 3 men: 12\n\n- 3 women and 1 man: 4\n\n- 3 women and 2 men: 6\n\n- 3 women and 3 men: 4\n\nAdding these up: 12 + 18 + 12 + 12 + 18 + 12 + 4 + 6 + 4 = Let's add them again:\n\n12 + 18 = 30\n\n30 + 12 = 42\n\n42 + 12 = 54\n\n54 + 18 = 72\n\n72 + 12 = 84\n\n84 + 4 = 88\n\n88 + 6 = 94\n\n94 + 4 = 98\n\nStill, that's 98, which doesn't match the earlier total of 105. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I missed some combinations. Let's see:\n\nLooking back, in my first approach, I had total subcommittees = 127, all-women = 7, all-men = 15, so 127 - 7 - 15 = 105.\n\nBut in the second approach, summing up the individual combinations, I got 98. So there's a discrepancy of 7.\n\nHmm, perhaps I missed the subcommittees that include all 3 women and all 4 men. Wait, but in the problem, it's a subcommittee of the main committee, and the main committee has only 7 members: 3 women and 4 men. So, selecting all 3 women and all 4 men would be selecting all 7 members, which should be included in the 3 women and 4 men category, which I think I already included in the 3 women and 3 men category. Wait, no, 3 women and 3 men would be selecting all 3 women and 3 out of 4 men, but not all 4 men.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to include the case where all 4 men are selected along with at least one woman.\n\nLet me adjust my approach.\n\nLet's consider the possible numbers of women and men:\n\n- 1 woman and 1 man to 4 men\n\n- 2 women and 1 man to 4 men\n\n- 3 women and 1 man to 4 men\n\nSo, for 1 woman:\n\n- 1 man: C(3,1) * C(4,1) = 3 * 4 = 12\n\n- 2 men: C(3,1) * C(4,2) = 3 * 6 = 18\n\n- 3 men: C(3,1) * C(4,3) = 3 * 4 = 12\n\n- 4 men: C(3,1) * C(4,4) = 3 * 1 = 3\n\nTotal for 1 woman: 12 + 18 + 12 + 3 = 45\n\nFor 2 women:\n\n- 1 man: C(3,2) * C(4,1) = 3 * 4 = 12\n\n- 2 men: C(3,2) * C(4,2) = 3 * 6 = 18\n\n- 3 men: C(3,2) * C(4,3) = 3 * 4 = 12\n\n- 4 men: C(3,2) * C(4,4) = 3 * 1 = 3\n\nTotal for 2 women: 12 + 18 + 12 + 3 = 45\n\nFor 3 women:\n\n- 1 man: C(3,3) * C(4,1) = 1 * 4 = 4\n\n- 2 men: C(3,3) * C(4,2) = 1 * 6 = 6\n\n- 3 men: C(3,3) * C(4,3) = 1 * 4 = 4\n\n- 4 men: C(3,3) * C(4,4) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nTotal for 3 women: 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15\n\nNow, adding up all these:\n\n1 woman: 45\n\n2 women: 45\n\n3 women: 15\n\nTotal: 45 + 45 + 15 = 105\n\nAh, so now it matches the earlier total of 105.\n\nSo, the discrepancy in my earlier calculation was that I didn't include the cases where 4 men are selected along with at least one woman.\n\nTherefore, the correct total number of subcommittees with at least one woman and at least one man is 105.\n\nAlternatively, sticking with the first approach is simpler: total subcommittees minus all-women minus all-men subcommittees.\n\nTotal subcommittees: \\(2^7 - 1 = 127\\)\n\nAll-women subcommittees: \\(2^3 - 1 = 7\\)\n\nAll-men subcommittees: \\(2^4 - 1 = 15\\)\n\nSo, 127 - 7 - 15 = 105.\n\nThis confirms the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nWe can also think of selecting at least one woman and at least one man by subtracting the all-women and all-men subcommittees from the total non-empty subcommittees.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of selecting at least one woman and at least one man by considering the inclusion of at least one woman and at least one man.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nNumber of subcommittees with at least one woman and at least one man = total subcommittees - (subcommittees with no women + subcommittees with no men).\n\nTotal subcommittees: \\(2^7 - 1 = 127\\)\n\nSubcommittees with no women (all men): \\(2^4 - 1 = 15\\)\n\nSubcommittees with no men (all women): \\(2^3 - 1 = 7\\)\n\nSo, 127 - 15 - 7 = 105.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the number of different subcommittees that can be formed, each containing at least one woman and at least one man, is 105.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
