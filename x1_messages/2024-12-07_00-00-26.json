Armored in her advanced astronaut attire, she anxiously awaited the approach.\n\nAlerts aboard Artemis announced their arrival. Alice activated her airlock, anticipating the adventure ahead. The asteroid's alien appearance amazed her; its angular surface appeared ancient, almost arcane.\n\nAlice attached herself to the asteroid using her advanced magnetic boots. Adjusting her antenna, she attempted audio communication with the mission control center. \"Artemis to base,\" she announced authoritatively.\n\nAfter what felt like an age, an answer arrived. \"Base to Artemis, go ahead,\" crackled the audio.\n\nAlice responded, \"We've arrived at Anubis. Atmosphere is as anticipated\u2014none. Proceeding with the assigned tasks.\"\n\nShe detached from Artemis and began ascending along the asteroid's surface, analyzing its composition. Her suit's analyzer indicated abundant amounts of aluminum and arsenic, with traces of actinium.\n\nAs she ascended, Alice admired the astral panorama. Stars appeared like scattered sequins against the abyssal blackness. She felt a mix of awe and apprehension, alone in the astronomical vastness.\n\nSuddenly, her suit's alarm blared. \"Anomaly detected,\" intoned the suit's artificial voice.\n\nAlice assessed her surroundings. Aside from the asteroid's unusual appearance, nothing seemed amiss. She checked her air supply; it was ample. Perhaps it was a malfunction.\n\nBut then, she noticed it\u2014an aperture in the asteroid's surface, concealed behind angular rocks. It appeared artificial, which was anomalous given Anubis's natural origin.\n\nAdrenaline surged through her as she approached the opening. With her advanced astronaut tools, she carefully cleared the debris blocking the entrance.\n\nInside, the air was stale but breathable\u2014another anomaly. Alice activated her suit's light emitter, casting an eerie glow on the alien walls.\n\nThe cavern appeared artificial, with angular corridors leading deeper into the asteroid. Alice advanced cautiously, her curiosity piqued.\n\nAt the end of the corridor, she discovered a chamber containing ancient artifacts. There were alien apparatuses, seemingly technological, emitting an ambient aura.\n\nAlice approached one device. It resembled a altar, with an indentation in the center. She wondered what ancient astronaut might have used it for.\n\nAs she touched the altar, a soft hum emanated from it. Suddenly, the room illuminated, and a holographic animation projected above the altar.\n\nThe animation depicted astronauts, not human but of an alien race, constructing similar altars across various asteroids. They appeared to be performing some form of astronomical alignment.\n\nAlice was astounded. This discovery could revolutionize astronautical history, providing evidence of ancient alien astronaut civilizations.\n\nShe began analyzing the artifacts, activating her suit's advanced recording equipment to archive the findings.\n\nHours passed as she documented each item, her excitement building. This was an archaeological astronautical dream come true.\n\nJust as she was about to exit, her suit's alert system beeped again. \"Approaching energy surge,\" it warned.\n\nAlice looked around but saw nothing unusual. Then, the altar began to glow more intensely. The hologram changed, showing the alien astronauts performing a ritual, culminating in the insertion of a crystal into the altar's indentation.\n\nInspired, Alice searched the chamber for any such crystal. She found a small, angular crystal embedded in a nearby artifact.\n\nCarefully, she extracted it and placed it in the altar's indentation. Instantly, the altar's glow intensified, and the hologram morphed into a map, displaying coordinates to another location in space.\n\nAlice realized this might be a clue to more discoveries, perhaps even to the aliens' home world.\n\nBut then, the energy surge alert grew more insistent. Looking up, Alice saw that the altar was overloading. Alarms blared in her suit as the energy levels became dangerous.\n\nPanic set in as she tried to remove the crystal, but it was lodged firmly in place. The altar began to pulsate erratically, emitting a high-pitched whine.\n\nAlice knew she had to abandon the chamber immediately. She sprinted down the corridor, the energy surge growing more intense behind her.\n\nAs she reached the entrance, she glanced back to see the altar explode in a burst of light, sealing the chamber shut with a resounding thud.\n\nDisoriented, Alice made her way back to Artemis, her mind reeling from the events. She had to alert mission control, but first, she needed to ensure her safety.\n\nOnce aboard Artemis, she activated the airlock and waited for it to cycle. As she entered the cockpit, she exhaled deeply, relieved to be safe.\n\nShe uploaded the recordings and data from her suit to Artemis's mainframe, then contacted mission control.\n\n\"Artemis to base, do you copy?\" she radioed.\n\n\"Base here. We copy. How copy you? We received your earlier transmission. What happened?\"\n\nAlice relayed the events, her voice alternating between awe and apprehension. \"I found a chamber with ancient artifacts, possibly from an alien civilization. There was an altar that projected holographic animations showing these aliens constructing similar altars on asteroids. I placed a crystal into it, and it showed coordinates to another location. But then, it overloaded and exploded.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence from mission control before they responded, \"Alice, that's incredible. We need to analyze this data. For now, secure the spacecraft and return to base as planned.\"\n\nAlice nodded, even though they couldn't see her. \"Understood. Artemis will return as scheduled.\"\n\nAs she prepared for the journey back, Alice couldn't shake off the adrenaline from her adventure. She had uncovered something monumental, something that could alter our understanding of astronautical history.\n\nBut there was more to be done. The coordinates from the altar beckoned to her, promising further discoveries. Perhaps one day, she would return to explore them.\n\nFor now, she focused on navigating Artemis back to Earth, knowing that her story would astound the astronomical community.\n\nAnd so, astronaut Alice brought back not just memories, but evidence of an ancient astronaut civilization, forever changing the way we look at the stars."
