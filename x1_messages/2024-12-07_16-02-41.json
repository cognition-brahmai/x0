        "content": "Let's see. So, in this room, half of the people are wearing glasses, one-third are wearing hats, and one-sixth are wearing both glasses and hats. I need to find out what fraction of the people are wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nOkay, so first, I know that if someone is wearing both glasses and hats, they are included in both the glasses group and the hats group. So, if I just add the fractions of people wearing glasses and wearing hats, I'll be double-counting those who wear both.\n\nSo, the formula for the union of two groups is:\n\nFraction wearing glasses or hats = Fraction wearing glasses + Fraction wearing hats - Fraction wearing both\n\nThat makes sense because we subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Fraction wearing glasses = 1/2\n\n- Fraction wearing hats = 1/3\n\n- Fraction wearing both = 1/6\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6\n\nNow, to add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2, 3, and 6 is 6.\n\nSo, converting each fraction:\n\n1/2 = 3/6\n\n1/3 = 2/6\n\n1/6 = 1/6\n\nNow, adding and subtracting:\n\n3/6 + 2/6 - 1/6 = (3 + 2 - 1)/6 = 4/6\n\nSimplifying 4/6, divide numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n4 \u00f7 2 = 2\n\n6 \u00f7 2 = 3\n\nSo, 2/3\n\nTherefore, two-thirds of the people in the room are wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose there are 6 people in the room, since 6 is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n\n- Half wearing glasses: 6 * 1/2 = 3 people\n\n- One-third wearing hats: 6 * 1/3 = 2 people\n\n- One-sixth wearing both: 6 * 1/6 = 1 person\n\nSo, among these 6 people:\n\n- 3 wear glasses\n\n- 2 wear hats\n\n- 1 wears both\n\nTo find those wearing either glasses or hats, we can add those wearing glasses and those wearing hats, but subtract those wearing both.\n\nSo, 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 people\n\nTherefore, 4 out of 6 people are wearing either glasses or hats, which is 4/6, or simplified, 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of sets.\n\nLet G be the set of people wearing glasses, and H be the set of people wearing hats.\n\nWe need to find the size of the union of G and H, which is |G \u222a H| = |G| + |H| - |G \u2229 H|\n\nGiven:\n\n|G| = 1/2\n\n|H| = 1/3\n\n|G \u2229 H| = 1/6\n\nSo, |G \u222a H| = 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6 = 2/3\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which is what we're using here. It's a standard method for counting elements in unions of sets without double-counting.\n\nSo, I think 2/3 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider if there's any possibility of people wearing neither glasses nor hats.\n\nWell, if 2/3 are wearing either glasses or hats, then 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 are wearing neither.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to, we could use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents glasses wearers, the other represents hat wearers.\n\n- The glasses circle has 1/2 of the total people.\n\n- The hats circle has 1/3 of the total people.\n\n- The overlap, wearing both, is 1/6.\n\nSo, the part wearing only glasses is 1/2 - 1/6 = 3/6 - 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nThe part wearing only hats is 1/3 - 1/6 = 2/6 - 1/6 = 1/6\n\nAnd the part wearing both is 1/6\n\nSo, the total wearing either glasses or hats is:\n\nOnly glasses: 1/3\n\nOnly hats: 1/6\n\nBoth: 1/6\n\nAdding up: 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3\n\nAgain, confirming the earlier result.\n\nI think it's clear now that the fraction of people wearing either glasses or hats is two-thirds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
