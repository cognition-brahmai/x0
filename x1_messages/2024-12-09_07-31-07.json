        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Here's a simple Python script that does exactly what you've asked for:\n\n```python\ndef count_word_frequency(text):\n    # Split the text into words\n    words = text.split()\n    \n    # Create an empty dictionary to store word frequencies\n    frequency = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Remove punctuation from the word\n        word = word.strip('.,!?;:\"()').lower()\n        \n        # If the word is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if word in frequency:\n            frequency[word] += 1\n        # Otherwise, add the word to the dictionary with a count of 1\n        else:\n            frequency[word] = 1\n    \n    return frequency\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a test. This test is only a test.\"\nprint(count_word_frequency(text))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Splitting the Text:** The input text is split into words using the `split()` method, which divides the string at spaces by default.\n2. **Removing Punctuation:** Each word is stripped of common punctuation marks using the `strip()` method. This helps ensure that words aren't counted differently due to trailing punctuation.\n3. **Case Insensitivity:** Words are converted to lowercase to make the count case-insensitive. For example, \"This\" and \"this\" are considered the same word.\n4. **Counting Frequencies:** A dictionary is used to keep track of word frequencies. If a word is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented; otherwise, it is added with a count of one.\n\nYou can test this function with different strings to see how it works. Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!\n"
