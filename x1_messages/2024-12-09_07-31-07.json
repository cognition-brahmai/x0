        "content": "That's a common misconception about medieval knights in full plate armor. Contrary to popular belief, knights in plate armor were quite mobile and didn't require cranes or assistance to mount their horses. In fact, plate armor was designed to provide protection while still allowing for a reasonable degree of movement.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the mounting of horses. Knights were trained from a young age in horsemanship and were skilled in mounting their horses without assistance. They often used a stirrup to help them swing a leg over the horse, but even without a stirrup, they could manage. There are historical accounts and depictions of knights dismounting and remounting their horses in the heat of battle, which would have been impossible if they needed cranes or help from others each time.\n\nAs for mobility in battle, plate armor, especially by the later Middle Ages, was engineered to provide protection without severely hampering movement. The armor was made up of articulated plates that allowed for bending at the elbows, knees, and other joints. This design enabled knights to walk, ride, and even fight effectively while wearing the armor.\n\nThere are also records of tournaments and battles where knights in full plate armor performed various physical activities, such as jousting, sword fighting, and even swimming. For example, during the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, English longbowmen were able to kill French knights who had fallen into the mud, which suggests that even in difficult terrain, knights in armor could move, albeit with more difficulty than unarmored soldiers.\n\nMoreover, the weight of the armor was distributed over the body in such a way that it was manageable for a trained and fit knight. The total weight of a full suit of plate armor was typically around 20-25 kilograms (45-55 pounds), which, while heavy, was not so burdensome that it immobilized the wearer.\n\nIn conclusion, knights in plate armor were capable of mounting their horses without assistance and were able to move around effectively in battle. The armor was designed with mobility in mind, and knights were trained to fight while wearing it. The idea that they needed cranes to get on their horses is a myth that doesn't hold up to historical evidence and practical considerations."
