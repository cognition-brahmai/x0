        "content": "So I've got this limit to evaluate: the limit as x approaches infinity of (2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4)/(x^3 + 3x^2 - 2). Hmm, okay, let's see how to tackle this.\n\nFirst off, when you're dealing with limits as x approaches infinity, especially with rational functions like this one, where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials, there's a general approach you can take.\n\nI remember that the degree of the polynomial in the numerator and the denominator plays a big role here. In this case, both the numerator and the denominator are cubic polynomials, meaning they both have degree 3.\n\nSo, the rule of thumb is:\n\n- If the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, the limit as x approaches infinity is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n- If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the limit is 0.\n\n- If the degree of the numerator is greater than the denominator, the limit is either positive or negative infinity, depending on the signs.\n\nIn this problem, since both polynomials are of degree 3, I should look at the leading coefficients.\n\nThe leading term in the numerator is 2x^3, so the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nThe leading term in the denominator is x^3, so the leading coefficient is 1.\n\nTherefore, the limit should be 2/1 = 2.\n\nBut wait, is that all there is to it? Seems a bit too straightforward. Maybe I should double-check by trying another method.\n\nLet me try dividing the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x, which is x^3 in this case.\n\nSo, f(x) = (2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4)/(x^3 + 3x^2 - 2)\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by x^3:\n\nNumerator: 2 - 5/x + 4/x^3\n\nDenominator: 1 + 3/x - 2/x^3\n\nSo, f(x) = (2 - 5/x + 4/x^3)/(1 + 3/x - 2/x^3)\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, the terms with x in the denominator approach zero.\n\nSo, limit as x approaches infinity is (2 - 0 + 0)/(1 + 0 - 0) = 2/1 = 2.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the behavior of the function for very large x.\n\nLet's pick a large value for x, say x = 1000.\n\nPlugging in x = 1000:\n\nf(1000) = (2*(1000)^3 - 5*(1000)^2 + 4)/(1000)^3 + 3*(1000)^2 - 2)\n\n= (2*1e9 - 5*1e6 + 4)/(1e9 + 3*1e6 - 2)\n\n= (2,000,000,000 - 5,000,000 + 4)/(1,000,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 2)\n\n= (1,995,000,004)/(1,003,000,000 - 2)\n\n\u2248 1,995,000,004 / 1,003,000,000\n\n\u2248 1.989\n\nThat's very close to 2.\n\nLet me try an even larger x, like x = 1,000,000.\n\nf(1,000,000) = (2*(1e18) - 5*(1e12) + 4)/(1e18 + 3*(1e12) - 2)\n\n= (2,000,000,000,000,000 - 5,000,000,000,000 + 4)/(1,000,000,000,000,000 + 3,000,000,000,000 - 2)\n\n= (1,995,000,000,000,004)/(1,003,000,000,000,000 - 2)\n\n\u2248 1,995,000,000,000,004 / 1,003,000,000,000,000\n\n\u2248 1.990\n\nEven closer to 2.\n\nThis reinforces my conclusion that the limit is 2.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, let's consider if there are any other factors that could affect the limit.\n\nFor example, are there any discontinuities or asymptotes that could influence the behavior as x approaches infinity?\n\nLooking at the denominator, x^3 + 3x^2 - 2, I should check if there are any real roots, as those could be vertical asymptotes.\n\nBut since we're interested in the limit as x approaches infinity, vertical asymptotes at finite x values shouldn't affect this limit.\n\nMoreover, since the degree of both polynomials is the same, there are no horizontal asymptotes other than y = 2, which is what we've already determined.\n\nAlso, there are no oblique asymptotes because the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal.\n\nTherefore, the limit as x approaches infinity is indeed 2.\n\nTo summarize, using the leading coefficients method and confirmed by algebraic manipulation and numerical substitution, the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
