        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a bakery wanting to optimize its production process by investing in new equipment. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nFirst, the bakery currently produces 10,000 loaves of bread daily using manual labor and traditional ovens, with an average production cost of $2 per loaf. So, their current daily cost is 10,000 loaves times $2, which is $20,000 per day.\n\nNow, the proposed automated system can produce 15,000 loaves daily at a reduced cost of $1.50 per loaf. So, the new daily cost would be 15,000 loaves times $1.50, which is $22,500 per day.\n\nWait a minute, that seems counterintuitive. The cost per loaf is going down from $2 to $1.50, but the total daily cost is going up from $20,000 to $22,500 because they're producing more loaves. But the problem is asking about optimizing production, so maybe they're looking to increase production and reduce the cost per unit.\n\nThe new equipment has an upfront cost of $500,000 and an estimated lifespan of five years. We need to calculate the payback period for this investment and determine whether it's financially viable.\n\nFirst, let's understand what payback period is. The payback period is the time it takes for the savings generated by the investment to equal the initial cost of the investment. So, we need to find out how long it will take for the savings to add up to $500,000.\n\nBut wait, in this case, it seems like the daily cost is increasing from $20,000 to $22,500, which means there are no cost savings; there are additional costs. So, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me read the problem again. \"The proposed automated system can produce 15,000 loaves daily at a reduced cost of $1.50 per loaf.\" So, the cost per loaf is reduced, but because they're producing more loaves, the total daily cost is higher.\n\nPerhaps the bakery is expecting to sell more loaves because of the increased production capacity. If they can sell 15,000 loaves daily instead of 10,000, then the increased revenue might make up for the higher costs.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about sales or revenue. It only talks about production costs. So, maybe the optimization is in reducing the cost per loaf, and if they maintain the same production level of 10,000 loaves, they would save money.\n\nLet's explore that possibility.\n\nIf they continue to produce only 10,000 loaves with the new system, the cost would be 10,000 loaves times $1.50, which is $15,000 per day. Compared to the current $20,000 per day, that's a savings of $5,000 per day.\n\nSo, the daily savings would be $5,000.\n\nNow, to find the payback period, we need to divide the initial investment by the daily savings and then convert it into years if needed.\n\nInitial investment: $500,000\n\nDaily savings: $5,000\n\nPayback period in days: $500,000 / $5,000 = 100 days\n\nNow, to convert 100 days into years, assuming 365 days per year:\n\n100 days / 365 days/year \u2248 0.274 years, or about 3.28 months\n\nSo, the payback period is approximately 100 days or about 3.3 months.\n\nBut wait, the new equipment has an estimated lifespan of five years. So, if the payback period is only about 3 months, that means the bakery will recover its investment very quickly and enjoy the benefits for the remaining four years and nine months.\n\nThat seems financially viable, as the payback period is relatively short compared to the lifespan of the equipment.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the bakery will indeed produce only 10,000 loaves with the new system or if they will take advantage of the increased capacity to produce 15,000 loaves.\n\nIf they produce 15,000 loaves, their total daily cost would be $22,500, which is higher than the current $20,000. In this case, there are no cost savings; instead, there are additional costs.\n\nBut perhaps the extra loaves can be sold, generating additional revenue.\n\nIf the bakery can sell the additional 5,000 loaves, then the additional revenue might cover the extra cost.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide information about the selling price per loaf or the demand for the additional loaves, I can't factor that into the calculation.\n\nGiven the information provided, I'll assume that the bakery will continue to produce only 10,000 loaves with the new system, thereby reducing their daily cost from $20,000 to $15,000, resulting in daily savings of $5,000.\n\nTherefore, the payback period is 100 days, which is very short, making the investment financially viable.\n\nAlternatively, if the bakery decides to produce the full capacity of 15,000 loaves with the new system, their daily cost increases to $22,500.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no cost savings; instead, there are additional costs.\n\nWithout knowing the additional revenue from selling more loaves, I can't determine if the investment is viable in this case.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems more plausible that the bakery wants to maintain its current production level of 10,000 loaves and reduce costs, resulting in a short payback period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ days}} \\]"
