        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"In how many ways can 5 people be seated in a row if two of them insist on sitting next to each other?\" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that if there were no restrictions, the number of ways to seat 5 people in a row is just 5 factorial, which is 5! = 120. But here, there's a condition that two specific people must sit next to each other. How do I factor that in?\n\nMaybe I can think of those two people as a single unit. So, instead of having 5 individual people, I have one combined unit and the other 3 people, making it 4 units to arrange. If I treat the two people who must sit together as one unit, then the number of ways to arrange these 4 units would be 4! = 24.\n\nBut wait, within that combined unit, the two people can switch places. For example, if the two people are A and B, they can be AB or BA. So, for each of those 24 arrangements, there are 2 ways to arrange A and B within their unit. Therefore, the total number of arrangements would be 24 * 2 = 48.\n\nIs that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the total number of arrangements without any restrictions, which is 120, and then subtract the number of arrangements where A and B are not sitting next to each other. But that seems more complicated, and since the problem specifies that they must sit next to each other, the first method might be better.\n\nLet me double-check by considering specific seats. Suppose we have seats 1 through 5.\n\nIf A and B must sit next to each other, possible pairs of seats are:\n\n- Seats 1 and 2\n\n- Seats 2 and 3\n\n- Seats 3 and 4\n\n- Seats 4 and 5\n\nSo, there are 4 possible pairs where A and B can sit together.\n\nFor each of these pairs, A and B can arrange themselves in 2 ways (AB or BA).\n\nThen, the remaining 3 seats can be filled by the other 3 people in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nSo, total arrangements would be 4 (pairs) * 2 (arrangements for A and B) * 6 (arrangements for the other 3) = 48.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, 48 seems to be the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at it. Suppose I fix A and B sitting together in a particular order, say AB, and see how many ways the others can be arranged.\n\nIf AB are treated as a single unit, then the arrangement could be AB followed by the other 3 people, or with AB in different positions.\n\nWait, that's similar to the first approach. Maybe I'm just going in circles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the number of ways to choose positions for A and B such that they are adjacent, and then arrange the others.\n\nThe number of ways to choose adjacent seats for A and B is 4 (as listed earlier), and for each choice, A and B can be arranged in 2 ways. Then, the remaining 3 seats can be filled by the other 3 people in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nAgain, 4 * 2 * 6 = 48.\n\nThis keeps reinforcing the answer of 48.\n\nLet me consider if there's any overlap or if I'm counting too much. For example, if I consider AB in seats 1 and 2, and then BA in seats 1 and 2, are these distinct arrangements? Yes, they are, so counting them separately is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for different pairs of seats, there shouldn't be any overlap.\n\nSo, I think 48 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's think about a smaller case. Suppose there are 3 people, A, B, and C, and A and B must sit next to each other.\n\nPossible arrangements:\n\n- AB_C\n\n- C_AB\n\n- BA_C\n\n- C_BA\n\nThat's 4 arrangements, which matches 2 (for AB and BA) multiplied by 2 (for the positions).\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, 4 pairs * 2 arrangements for A and B * 6 arrangements for the others = 48.\n\nThis smaller case confirms the logic.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to seat 5 people in a row with two specific people sitting next to each other is 48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
