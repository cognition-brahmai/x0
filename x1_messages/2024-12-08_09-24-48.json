        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple calculator class in Java that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Also, I need to make sure it handles exceptions like division by zero. Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to define a class, probably called something like \"SimpleCalculator\". Inside this class, I'll need methods for each of the operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.\n\nFor addition, it's straightforward. I'll take two numbers, add them together, and return the result. Same for subtraction and multiplication. Division might be a bit trickier because I need to handle the case where the denominator is zero.\n\nI should also think about the data types. Since I'm dealing with arithmetic operations, using double might be a good choice to handle both integers and floating-point numbers.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline:\n\n- Class: SimpleCalculator\n\n- Methods:\n\n- double add(double a, double b)\n\n- double subtract(double a, double b)\n\n- double multiply(double a, double b)\n\n- double divide(double a, double b)\n\nIn the divide method, I need to check if the second parameter (the denominator) is zero. If it is, I should throw an exception or handle it in some way to avoid runtime errors.\n\nJava has built-in exception handling with try-catch blocks. Maybe I can use that to catch the ArithmeticException that occurs when dividing by zero.\n\nWait, actually, in Java, dividing by zero in primitive types like double results in Infinity or NaN, but it doesn't throw an ArithmeticException. So, I need to check if the denominator is zero before performing the division.\n\nPerhaps I can throw a custom exception if the denominator is zero, like a DivisionByZeroException.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I can just return a specific value or print an error message.\n\nLet me think about the best way to handle this.\n\nOption 1: Return Double.NaN if division by zero occurs.\n\nOption 2: Throw an IllegalArgumentException with a message.\n\nOption 3: Print an error message and return zero.\n\nI think throwing an exception is the most appropriate way because it alerts the caller that something wrong happened, and they can handle it accordingly.\n\nSo, I'll go with throwing an exception in the divide method if the denominator is zero.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the methods are static if I want to call them without creating an instance of the class.\n\nWait, unless specified otherwise, I'll make them instance methods.\n\nLet me consider if it makes sense to have multiple instances of the calculator. Probably not, so maybe making all methods static would be fine.\n\nIn that case, I can make the class have private constructors to prevent instantiation.\n\nLike this:\n\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n\nprivate SimpleCalculator() {}\n\npublic static double add(double a, double b) {\n\nreturn a + b;\n\n}\n\n// similar for subtract, multiply, divide\n\n}\n\nYes, that seems reasonable.\n\nNow, for the divide method:\n\npublic static double divide(double a, double b) {\n\nif (b == 0) {\n\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n\n}\n\nreturn a / b;\n\n}\n\nThat should handle the division by zero case by throwing an exception with an appropriate message.\n\nI should also think about whether I need to handle any other exceptions or edge cases. For example, very large numbers that might cause overflow, but in Java, double can handle a wide range of values, so it's less of a concern.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether I need to handle non-numeric inputs, but since the methods expect double parameters, it's assumed that the inputs are numeric.\n\nI should also write some test code to verify that the methods work as expected.\n\nMaybe I can create a main method inside the SimpleCalculator class to test the operations.\n\nLike this:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nSystem.out.println(add(5, 3)); // 8.0\n\nSystem.out.println(subtract(5, 3)); // 2.0\n\nSystem.out.println(multiply(5, 3)); // 15.0\n\ntry {\n\nSystem.out.println(divide(5, 0)); // should throw exception\n\n} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n\nSystem.out.println(e.getMessage());\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis way, I can see that the exception is thrown and handled properly.\n\nLet me also consider if I need to format the output in any way, but since we're dealing with doubles, the default formatting should be fine for now.\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements for a simple calculator class.\n\nJust to summarize, the class will have:\n\n- Private constructor to prevent instantiation.\n\n- Static methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n- Division method throws an exception if denominator is zero.\n\n- A main method for testing the operations.\n\nI can also add javadocs to the methods to describe their functionality, but for a simple task, it might be optional.\n\nAlright, I think I'm ready to write the code now.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple calculator in Java that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we can define a class named `SimpleCalculator` with static methods for each operation. We need to ensure that the division operation handles the case where the denominator is zero by throwing an exception.\n\n```java\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n\n    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation\n    private SimpleCalculator() {}\n\n    // Method to add two numbers\n    public static double add(double a, double b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n\n    // Method to subtract two numbers\n    public static double subtract(double a, double b) {\n        return a - b;\n    }\n\n    // Method to multiply two numbers\n    public static double multiply(double a, double b) {\n        return a * b;\n    }\n\n    // Method to divide two numbers\n    public static double divide(double a, double b) {\n        if (b == 0) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n        }\n        return a / b;\n    }\n\n    // Main method for testing\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(add(5, 3)); // 8.0\n        System.out.println(subtract(5, 3)); // 2.0\n        System.out.println(multiply(5, 3)); // 15.0\n        try {\n            System.out.println(divide(5, 0)); // should throw exception\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The `SimpleCalculator` class is defined with a private constructor to prevent instantiation since all methods are static.\n\n2. **Methods**:\n   - `add(double a, double b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.\n   - `subtract(double a, double b)`: Returns the difference of `a` and `b`.\n   - `multiply(double a, double b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.\n   - `divide(double a, double b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` and `b`. If `b` is zero, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with an appropriate message.\n\n3. **Testing**: The `main` method tests all operations, including an attempt to divide by zero to demonstrate exception handling."
