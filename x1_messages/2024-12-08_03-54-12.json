        "content": "Let's see. Alice scores 3 points every minute, and Bob scores 5 points every 2 minutes. We need to find out who scores more after 1 hour and by how much.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many points each of them scores in 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, I can calculate Alice's total points by multiplying her score per minute by 60.\n\nAlice's total points = 3 points/minute * 60 minutes = 180 points.\n\nNow, for Bob, he scores 5 points every 2 minutes. So, in 60 minutes, I need to find out how many 2-minute intervals there are.\n\nNumber of 2-minute intervals in 60 minutes = 60 / 2 = 30.\n\nSo, Bob's total points = 5 points/interval * 30 intervals = 150 points.\n\nComparing the two, Alice scores 180 points and Bob scores 150 points. So, Alice scores more.\n\nTo find out by how much, I subtract Bob's total from Alice's total.\n\n180 points - 150 points = 30 points.\n\nTherefore, Alice scores 30 more points than Bob after 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
