        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces 500 units of a product per day. The production rate increases by 10% each week, and we need to find out how many units will be produced in the third week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have an initial daily production rate, and it's increasing weekly by 10%. So, each week, the daily production rate goes up by 10% compared to the previous week.\n\nNow, to find the production in the third week, I need to calculate the daily production rate for that week and then find out the total production for the entire week.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. **Initial daily production:** 500 units per day.\n\n2. **Weekly increase:** 10%.\n\n3. **Find production in the third week.**\n\nI think I need to calculate the daily production rate for week 1, week 2, and then week 3, considering the 10% increase each week.\n\nLet's start with week 1:\n\n- Week 1 daily production: 500 units per day.\n\nSince the production increases by 10% each week, for week 2:\n\n- Week 2 daily production: Week 1 daily production + (10% of Week 1 daily production)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n- 10% of 500 = 0.10 * 500 = 50 units.\n\n- So, Week 2 daily production: 500 + 50 = 550 units per day.\n\nNow, for week 3:\n\n- Week 3 daily production: Week 2 daily production + (10% of Week 2 daily production)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n- 10% of 550 = 0.10 * 550 = 55 units.\n\n- So, Week 3 daily production: 550 + 55 = 605 units per day.\n\nNow, to find the total production for the third week, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week. Assuming a week has 7 days:\n\n- Total production in week 3: 605 units/day * 7 days = 4235 units.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this? Maybe using the formula for compound increase?\n\nYes, since the production increases by 10% each week, it's similar to compound interest.\n\nThe formula for compound growth is:\n\n\\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount after \\( n \\) periods.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (initial amount).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the rate of increase per period.\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of periods.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\( P \\) = 500 units per day.\n\n- \\( r \\) = 10% or 0.10 per week.\n\n- \\( n \\) = 2 weeks (since we're looking for the third week, and the first week is the base).\n\nWait, actually, if we consider week 1 as the base, then week 2 is after 1 week, and week 3 is after 2 weeks. So, \\( n \\) should be 2.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 500 \\times (1 + 0.10)^2 \\]\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0.10 = 1.10 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ 1.10^2 = 1.21 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A = 500 \\times 1.21 = 605 \\] units per day in the third week.\n\nThen, total production in the third week:\n\n\\[ 605 \\times 7 = 4235 \\] units.\n\nWait, but is the production rate increasing weekly, or is it increasing weekly based on the daily rate?\n\nLet me double-check the problem statement: \"the production rate increases by 10% each week.\"\n\nNow, it's a bit ambiguous whether this increase is applied to the daily rate or the weekly total.\n\nIf it's applied to the daily rate, then my earlier approach is correct.\n\nBut if it's applied to the weekly total, then I need to calculate the weekly production first and then apply the 10% increase.\n\nLet me consider both scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1: Increase on daily rate**\n\n- Week 1 daily production: 500 units.\n\n- Week 2 daily production: 500 * 1.10 = 550 units.\n\n- Week 3 daily production: 550 * 1.10 = 605 units.\n\n- Total for week 3: 605 * 7 = 4235 units.\n\n**Scenario 2: Increase on weekly total**\n\nFirst, find the weekly production for week 1:\n\n- Week 1 total: 500 units/day * 7 days = 3500 units.\n\nThen, week 2 total: 3500 + (0.10 * 3500) = 3500 + 350 = 3850 units.\n\nWeek 3 total: 3850 + (0.10 * 3850) = 3850 + 385 = 4235 units.\n\nInteresting, in both scenarios, the total production for the third week is 4235 units.\n\nSo, regardless of whether the 10% increase is applied to the daily rate or the weekly total, the result is the same.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 4235 units in the third week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4235} \\]"
