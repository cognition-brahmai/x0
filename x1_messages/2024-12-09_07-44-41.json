        "content": "So the population is growing at 3% per year, and right now there are 5 million people. I need to find out how many people there will be after 10 years. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving exponential growth, right?\n\nI remember that for exponential growth, there's a formula that looks like this: P = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where:\n\n- P is the future population\n\n- P0 is the initial population\n\n- r is the growth rate\n\n- t is the time in years\n\nSo in this case, P0 is 5 million, r is 3% or 0.03, and t is 10 years. Plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\nP = 5,000,000 * (1 + 0.03)^10\n\nFirst, I need to calculate (1 + 0.03), which is 1.03. Then raise that to the 10th power. Let me grab a calculator for that.\n\n1.03 to the power of 10 is approximately 1.3439.\n\nSo now, multiply that by 5,000,000:\n\n5,000,000 * 1.3439 = 6,719,500\n\nSo, after 10 years, the population would be about 6,719,500 people.\n\nBut wait, I should check if this is the correct approach. Maybe there's another way to calculate population growth. Perhaps using logarithms or something else.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as compound interest, since it's similar\u2014the population is increasing by 3% each year, compounded annually.\n\nSo, using the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but in this case, since it's compounded annually, n=1.\n\nSo it's A = P(1 + r)^t, which is the same as the exponential growth formula I used earlier.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that my approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to verify this is to calculate the population year by year.\n\nStarting with 5,000,000 people.\n\nAfter year 1: 5,000,000 + 0.03*5,000,000 = 5,000,000 * 1.03 = 5,150,000\n\nAfter year 2: 5,150,000 * 1.03 = 5,304,500\n\nAfter year 3: 5,304,500 * 1.03 \u2248 5,463,635\n\nAfter year 4: 5,463,635 * 1.03 \u2248 5,627,544\n\nAfter year 5: 5,627,544 * 1.03 \u2248 5,796,370\n\nAfter year 6: 5,796,370 * 1.03 \u2248 5,969,261\n\nAfter year 7: 5,969,261 * 1.03 \u2248 6,148,339\n\nAfter year 8: 6,148,339 * 1.03 \u2248 6,332,789\n\nAfter year 9: 6,332,789 * 1.03 \u2248 6,522,773\n\nAfter year 10: 6,522,773 * 1.03 \u2248 6,718,456\n\nSo, using this method, I get approximately 6,718,456 people after 10 years, which is very close to the earlier calculation of 6,719,500. The slight difference is likely due to rounding errors in each step.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that after 10 years, the population will be around 6,719,500 people.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if the growth rate could be compounded more frequently than annually, like monthly or continuously. However, since the problem states that the population grows at 3% per year, it's safe to assume annual compounding.\n\nAlternatively, if the growth were continuous, the formula would be P = P0 * e^(rt), where e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nSo, P = 5,000,000 * e^(0.03*10)\n\nCalculating e^0.3 is approximately 1.3499\n\nSo, 5,000,000 * 1.3499 = 6,749,500\n\nThis is slightly higher than the earlier calculation, but since the problem specifies annual growth rate, the first method is more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 6,719,500 people.\n\nIt's also important to consider that population growth may not always be exponential due to factors like limited resources, policy interventions, etc. But based on the information provided, the exponential growth model is appropriate here.\n\nIn conclusion, after 10 years, the population will be about 6,719,500 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6719500} \\]"
