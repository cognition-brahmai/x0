        "content": "Alright, I'm going to write a Java program that acts as a simple command-line calculator. It should be able to handle basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users should be able to input expressions like \"5 + 3\" or \"12 / 4\", and the program should return the correct result.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to structure this program. Since it's a command-line calculator, it should repeatedly ask the user for input until they decide to exit. So, I'll need some kind of loop that keeps running until the user chooses to stop.\n\nI should also consider how to parse the user's input. The input will be a string in the format \"number operator number\", like \"5 + 3\". I need to split this string into parts: the first number, the operator, and the second number. Then, based on the operator, perform the corresponding operation.\n\nError handling is important too. I need to handle cases where the user inputs invalid expressions, such as dividing by zero or entering non-numeric values for numbers.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start the program and display a welcome message.\n\n2. Enter a loop that continues until the user decides to exit.\n\n3. Inside the loop, prompt the user to enter an expression.\n\n4. Read the user's input.\n\n5. Parse the input to extract the two numbers and the operator.\n\n6. Based on the operator, perform the corresponding operation.\n\n7. Display the result to the user.\n\n8. Ask if the user wants to perform another calculation or exit.\n\n9. If the user wants to continue, repeat the loop; otherwise, exit the program.\n\nI need to handle possible exceptions, such as:\n\n- Division by zero.\n\n- Invalid operators.\n\n- Non-numeric inputs for numbers.\n\nTo handle these, I'll use try-catch blocks to catch exceptions like ArithmeticException for division by zero and NumberFormatException if the user enters non-numeric values for numbers.\n\nLet me think about how to parse the input. I can split the input string by spaces. Assuming the user enters exactly \"number operator number\", splitting by spaces should give me an array of three elements: [number1, operator, number2]. Then, I can convert number1 and number2 to double or float to handle decimal numbers.\n\nI should also consider allowing user to exit the program by entering a specific command, like \"exit\" or \"quit\".\n\nLet me sketch a rough code structure:\n\n```java\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Calculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        boolean continueCalculating = true;\n\n        while (continueCalculating) {\n\n            System.out.println(\"Enter an expression (e.g., 5 + 3) or type 'exit' to quit:\");\n\n            String input = scanner.nextLine();\n\n            if (input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"exit\")) {\n\n                continueCalculating = false;\n\n                continue;\n\n            }\n\n            String[] parts = input.split(\" \");\n\n            if (parts.length != 3) {\n\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid input format. Please enter in format: number operator number\");\n\n                continue;\n\n            }\n\n            try {\n\n                double num1 = Double.parseDouble(parts[0]);\n\n                double num2 = Double.parseDouble(parts[2]);\n\n                char operator = parts[1].charAt(0);\n\n                double result = 0;\n\n                switch (operator) {\n\n                    case '+':\n\n                        result = num1 + num2;\n\n                        break;\n\n                    case '-':\n\n                        result = num1 - num2;\n\n                        break;\n\n                    case '*':\n\n                        result = num1 * num2;\n\n                        break;\n\n                    case '/':\n\n                        if (num2 == 0) {\n\n                            throw new ArithmeticException(\"Division by zero.\");\n\n                        }\n\n                        result = num1 / num2;\n\n                        break;\n\n                    default:\n\n                        System.out.println(\"Invalid operator. Supported operators: +, -, *, /\");\n\n                        continue;\n\n                }\n\n                System.out.printf(\"Result: %.2f%n\", result);\n\n            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid number format. Please enter numeric values for numbers.\");\n\n            } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n\n                System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Exiting calculator.\");\n\n        scanner.close();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Let me test this logic with some sample inputs.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 5 + 3\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"+\", \"3\"]\n\nnum1: 5.0\n\nnum2: 3.0\n\noperator: '+'\n\nresult: 8.0\n\nOutput: Result: 8.00\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 12 / 4\n\nParts: [\"12\", \"/\", \"4\"]\n\nnum1: 12.0\n\nnum2: 4.0\n\noperator: '/'\n\nresult: 3.0\n\nOutput: Result: 3.00\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: 7 * 2\n\nParts: [\"7\", \"*\", \"2\"]\n\nnum1: 7.0\n\nnum2: 2.0\n\noperator: '*'\n\nresult: 14.0\n\nOutput: Result: 14.00\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: 9 - 2\n\nParts: [\"9\", \"-\", \"2\"]\n\nnum1: 9.0\n\nnum2: 2.0\n\noperator: '-'\n\nresult: 7.0\n\nOutput: Result: 7.00\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: 5 / 0\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"/\", \"0\"]\n\nnum1: 5.0\n\nnum2: 0.0\n\noperator: '/'\n\nThrow ArithmeticException: Division by zero.\n\nOutput: Division by zero.\n\nExample 6:\n\nInput: 5 / abc\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"/\", \"abc\"]\n\nnum1: 5.0\n\nnum2: NumberFormatException\n\nOutput: Invalid number format. Please enter numeric values for numbers.\n\nExample 7:\n\nInput: 5 ^ 3\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"^\", \"3\"]\n\noperator: '^'\n\nInvalid operator.\n\nOutput: Invalid operator. Supported operators: +, -, *, /\n\nExample 8:\n\nInput: exit\n\nExit the program.\n\nOutput: Exiting calculator.\n\nSeems like it handles various cases correctly. I should also consider if the user enters more or fewer than three parts. For example:\n\nInput: 5 + 3 7\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"+\", \"3\", \"7\"]\n\nLength: 4\n\nInvalid input format.\n\nInput: 5 +\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"+\"]\n\nLength: 2\n\nInvalid input format.\n\nInput: +\n\nParts: [\"+\"]\n\nLength: 1\n\nInvalid input format.\n\nInput: 5\n\nParts: [\"5\"]\n\nInvalid input format.\n\nInput: exit\n\nExit the program.\n\nGood, the program should handle these cases by prompting for correct input format.\n\nI should also think about allowing decimal numbers. Since I'm using double, it should handle decimals fine.\n\nInput: 4.5 * 2.3\n\nParts: [\"4.5\", \"*\", \"2.3\"]\n\nnum1: 4.5\n\nnum2: 2.3\n\noperator: '*'\n\nresult: 10.35\n\nOutput: Result: 10.35\n\nLooks good.\n\nAnother consideration is handling multiple spaces or extra spaces in the input. For example:\n\nInput: 5 + 3\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"+\", \"3\"]\n\nGood.\n\nInput: 5 +    3\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"+\", \"3\"]\n\nStill good.\n\nInput: 5   + 3\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"+\", \"3\"]\n\nNo issue.\n\nJava's split(\" \") should handle multiple spaces by default.\n\nWhat if the user enters negative numbers?\n\nInput: -5 + 3\n\nParts: [\"-5\", \"+\", \"3\"]\n\nnum1: -5.0\n\nnum2: 3.0\n\noperator: '+'\n\nresult: -2.0\n\nOutput: Result: -2.00\n\nGood.\n\nInput: 5 - -3\n\nParts: [\"5\", \"-\", \"-3\"]\n\nnum1: 5.0\n\nnum2: -3.0\n\noperator: '-'\n\nresult: 8.0\n\nOutput: Result: 8.00\n\nPerfect.\n\nI should also consider if the user puts spaces around the operator or not.\n\nInput: 5+3\n\nParts: [\"5+3\"]\n\nLength: 1\n\nInvalid input format.\n\nHmm, in this case, split(\" \") will treat \"5+3\" as one part because there are no spaces. So, I need to ensure that the user includes spaces between numbers and operators.\n\nMaybe I should provide instructions to the user about the expected input format.\n\nIn the welcome message, I can say:\n\n\"Welcome to the calculator. Please enter expressions in the format: number operator number, where operator is one of +, -, *, /. To exit, type 'exit'.\"\n\nThis should clarify the expected input format.\n\nAnother thing to consider is making the program case-insensitive for the exit command. I already have input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"exit\"), so that's covered.\n\nLet me think about the user interface. After each calculation, the program should ask if the user wants to perform another calculation or exit. Currently, the loop continues automatically after each calculation. Maybe I should ask the user if they want to continue.\n\nAlternatively, I can make it so that the program repeatedly asks for input until the user types 'exit'. That's what I have now, which I think is straightforward.\n\nI should also handle the situation where the user just presses enter without entering anything.\n\nInput: [empty string]\n\nParts: [\"\"]\n\nLength: 0\n\nInvalid input format.\n\nGood, it will prompt for correct format.\n\nAnother consideration is handling multiple operations in one expression, but that's beyond the scope of a basic calculator. For now, the calculator should handle only two numbers and one operator.\n\nI should also think about the precision of the output. Using %.2f limits the result to two decimal places. Maybe I should use a higher precision or adjust it based on the user's needs. For simplicity, two decimal places should suffice for now.\n\nLet me think about how to handle very large or very small numbers. Since I'm using double, it should handle a wide range of values, but I should be aware of potential overflow or underflow issues.\n\nFor division, if the result is a repeating decimal, double might not show the full precision, but again, for a basic calculator, %.2f should be acceptable.\n\nI should also consider that if the user enters something other than the specified operators, it should inform the user about supported operators.\n\nIn the switch statement, I have a default case to handle invalid operators.\n\nI think this covers most of the scenarios.\n\nLet me write the actual code based on the sketched structure.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Java that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can use the following code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Calculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        boolean continueCalculating = true;\n\n        while (continueCalculating) {\n            System.out.println(\"Enter an expression (e.g., 5 + 3) or type 'exit' to quit:\");\n            String input = scanner.nextLine();\n\n            if (input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"exit\")) {\n                continueCalculating = false;\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            String[] parts = input.split(\" \");\n\n            if (parts.length != 3) {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid input format. Please enter in format: number operator number\");\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            try {\n                double num1 = Double.parseDouble(parts[0]);\n                double num2 = Double.parseDouble(parts[2]);\n                char operator = parts[1].charAt(0);\n                double result = 0;\n\n                switch (operator) {\n                    case '+':\n                        result = num1 + num2;\n                        break;\n                    case '-':\n                        result = num1 - num2;\n                        break;\n                    case '*':\n                        result = num1 * num2;\n                        break;\n                    case '/':\n                        if (num2 == 0) {\n                            throw new ArithmeticException(\"Division by zero.\");\n                        }\n                        result = num1 / num2;\n                        break;\n                    default:\n                        System.out.println(\"Invalid operator. Supported operators: +, -, *, /\");\n                        continue;\n                }\n\n                System.out.printf(\"Result: %.2f%n\", result);\n            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid number format. Please enter numeric values for numbers.\");\n            } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n                System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Exiting calculator.\");\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Loop and User Input**:\n   - The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they decide to exit by typing 'exit'.\n   - It reads the entire line of input using `scanner.nextLine()`.\n\n2. **Input Parsing**:\n   - The input string is split by spaces into an array of strings.\n   - If the input does not consist of exactly three parts (number, operator, number), it prompts the user to enter the correct format.\n\n3. **Exception Handling**:\n   - The program uses `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `NumberFormatException` (if the numbers are not valid doubles) and `ArithmeticException` (if there is a division by zero).\n\n4. **Operation Based on Operator**:\n   - Uses a `switch` statement to perform the operation corresponding to the operator provided.\n   - Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - Displays the result formatted to two decimal places.\n   - Provides messages for invalid inputs or operations.\n\nThis simple calculator handles basic arithmetic operations and ensures that user inputs are correctly managed with appropriate error messages."
