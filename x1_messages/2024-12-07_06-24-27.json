        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 8 yellow balls in a box, making a total of 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 balls. I need to find the probability that when I pick three balls at random without replacement, at least two of them are yellow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least two yellow balls\" means. It means that in the three balls I pick, either two are yellow or all three are yellow. So, I need to calculate the probability of these two scenarios and then add them together.\n\nI recall that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to pick any three balls out of 18.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 18 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 18 is:\n\n\\[\nC(18, 3) = \\frac{18!}{3!(18 - 3)!} = \\frac{18!}{3! \\times 15!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 15! in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(18, 3) = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15!}{3! \\times 15!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{3!}\n\\]\n\nAnd since 3! = 6,\n\n\\[\nC(18, 3) = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{6} = 3 \\times 17 \\times 16 = 51 \\times 16 = 816\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that calculation.\n\nActually, 18 choose 3 is a standard calculation, and I believe the correct value is:\n\n\\[\nC(18, 3) = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{4896}{6} = 816\n\\]\n\nHmm, but I know that's not correct because I recall that 18 choose 3 is 816, but let me verify again.\n\nActually, no, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\n\\[\n18 \\times 17 = 306\n\\]\n\n\\[\n306 \\times 16 = 4896\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3! = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4896 \u00f7 6 = 816\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, there are 816 possible ways to choose any 3 balls out of 18.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the scenarios where at least two balls are yellow. That means either exactly two yellow balls or exactly three yellow balls.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of ways to get exactly two yellow balls.\n\nThere are 8 yellow balls, and I need to choose 2 of them. The number of ways to do that is:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 6!} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to choose 2 yellow balls.\n\nNow, since I'm choosing 3 balls in total, and 2 of them are yellow, the third ball must be either red or blue. There are 4 red and 6 blue balls, making a total of 4 + 6 = 10 balls that are not yellow.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the third ball, which is not yellow, is:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 1) = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose exactly 2 yellow balls and 1 non-yellow ball is:\n\n\\[\n28 \\times 10 = 280\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways to get exactly three yellow balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 yellow balls out of 8 is:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8 - 3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\times 5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5!}{6 \\times 5!} = \\frac{336}{6} = 56\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose 3 yellow balls.\n\nNow, the total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the ways to choose exactly 2 yellow balls and exactly 3 yellow balls:\n\n\\[\n280 + 56 = 336\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking at least two yellow balls is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least 2 yellow}) = \\frac{336}{816}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 48:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{336 \u00f7 48}{816 \u00f7 48} = \\frac{7}{17}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{7}{17} \\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that simplification.\n\n336 divided by 48 is 7, and 816 divided by 48 is 17, so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can confirm this by calculating it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is to use the concept of combinations and probabilities directly.\n\nThe probability of picking at least two yellow balls can also be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least 2 yellow}) = P(\\text{exactly 2 yellow}) + P(\\text{exactly 3 yellow})\n\\]\n\nWe already calculated the number of ways for each:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 2 yellow}) = \\frac{C(8, 2) \\times C(10, 1)}{C(18, 3)} = \\frac{28 \\times 10}{816} = \\frac{280}{816}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 3 yellow}) = \\frac{C(8, 3)}{C(18, 3)} = \\frac{56}{816}\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least 2 yellow}) = \\frac{280 + 56}{816} = \\frac{336}{816} = \\frac{7}{17}\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, I could also use the complement rule, which states that:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least 2 yellow}) = 1 - P(\\text{less than 2 yellow})\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{less than 2 yellow}) = P(\\text{0 yellow}) + P(\\text{1 yellow})\n\\]\n\nBut since the problem asks for at least two yellow, and we've already calculated it directly, I'll stick with the initial approach.\n\nI think \\( \\frac{7}{17} \\) is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{17}} \\]"
