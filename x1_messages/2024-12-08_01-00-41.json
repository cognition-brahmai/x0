        "content": "So I've got this differential equation to solve: dy/dx = y/x, and there's an initial condition y(1) = 2. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, this looks like a separable differential equation. That means I can get all the y's on one side and all the x's on the other side. So, I'll start by separating the variables.\n\nStarting with dy/dx = y/x.\n\nI can rewrite this as dy/y = dx/x.\n\nNow, I'll integrate both sides.\n\n\u222b(1/y) dy = \u222b(1/x) dx.\n\nThe integral of 1/y with respect to y is ln|y|, and the integral of 1/x with respect to x is ln|x|.\n\nSo, ln|y| = ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, to solve for y, I'll exponentiate both sides to get rid of the natural log.\n\ne^(ln|y|) = e^(ln|x| + C).\n\nSimplifying, this gives me |y| = e^(ln|x|) * e^C.\n\nSince e^(ln|x|) is just |x|, and e^C is just some positive constant, let's call it C again (since it's still an arbitrary constant), but now it's positive.\n\nSo, |y| = C |x|.\n\nNow, since y can be positive or negative, and C is positive, I can write y = K x, where K is any real number (positive or negative).\n\nWait a minute, but I have an initial condition: y(1) = 2.\n\nPlugging in x = 1, y = 2 into y = K x, I get 2 = K * 1, so K = 2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is y = 2x.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf y = 2x, then dy/dx = 2.\n\nAnd y/x = 2x / x = 2.\n\nSo, dy/dx = y/x = 2, which checks out.\n\nAlso, y(1) = 2*1 = 2, which matches the initial condition.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{y = 2x} \\]"
