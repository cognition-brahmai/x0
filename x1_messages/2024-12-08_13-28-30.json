        "content": "Sure! I can help you develop a basic command-line calculator in Ruby that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll create a simple program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and outputs the result of the operation.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check this by running `ruby -v` in your command line. If Ruby is installed, it should display the version number.\n\nNow, let's start by understanding the requirements:\n\n1. **Input**: The program should accept two numbers and an operator.\n2. **Operators**: Support for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Output**: Display the result of the operation.\n\nWe'll break this down into smaller steps:\n\n### Step 1: Get User Input\n\nWe need to get three inputs from the user:\n\n- First number\n- Operator\n- Second number\n\nIn Ruby, we can use `gets` to read input from the user. `gets` reads a line from standard input, including the newline character, so we'll use `chomp` to remove the newline.\n\n```ruby\nputs \"Enter the first number:\"\nnum1 = gets.chomp.to_f\n\nputs \"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /):\"\noperator = gets.chomp\n\nputs \"Enter the second number:\"\nnum2 = gets.chomp.to_f\n```\n\nHere, we're converting the numbers to floats to handle decimal numbers as well.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Operation\n\nBased on the operator, we'll perform the corresponding operation:\n\n- If the operator is `+`, add the numbers.\n- If the operator is `-`, subtract the numbers.\n- If the operator is `*`, multiply the numbers.\n- If the operator is `/`, divide the numbers.\n\nWe'll use a case statement for this:\n\n```ruby\ncase operator\nwhen \"+\"\n  result = num1 + num2\nwhen \"-\"\n  result = num1 - num2\nwhen \"*\"\n  result = num1 * num2\nwhen \"/\"\n  if num2 != 0\n    result = num1 / num2\n  else\n    puts \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    exit\n  end\nelse\n  puts \"Invalid operator\"\n  exit\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Display the Result\n\nFinally, we'll print the result:\n\n```ruby\nputs \"The result is: #{result}\"\n```\n\n###\u5b8c\u6574\u4ee3\u7801\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete calculator program:\n\n```ruby\nputs \"Enter the first number:\"\nnum1 = gets.chomp.to_f\n\nputs \"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /):\"\noperator = gets.chomp\n\nputs \"Enter the second number:\"\nnum2 = gets.chomp.to_f\n\ncase operator\nwhen \"+\"\n  result = num1 + num2\nwhen \"-\"\n  result = num1 - num2\nwhen \"*\"\n  result = num1 * num2\nwhen \"/\"\n  if num2 != 0\n    result = num1 / num2\n  else\n    puts \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    exit\n  end\nelse\n  puts \"Invalid operator\"\n  exit\nend\n\nputs \"The result is: #{result}\"\n```\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code to a file, for example, `calculator.rb`.\n2. Open your command line.\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n4. Run the program by typing `ruby calculator.rb` and press Enter.\n5. Follow the prompts to enter the numbers and operator.\n\nThis should give you a basic command-line calculator in Ruby.
