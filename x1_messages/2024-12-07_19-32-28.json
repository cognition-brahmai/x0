Each plan should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, one or more prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. This tool is helpful in finding a suitable list of sites that may or may not contain the answer to the user's question. The function does not directly answer the question but finds a list of sites that may have the answer.\nSiteScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links, where the input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nALICE[input]: Question-answering language model, especially useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :fact[n]: variable, e.g., How tall is the Eiffel Tower, given :fact1:?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a fact variable, e.g., ALICE[Who won the 2020 presidential election, given :fact3:?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:fact0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :fact0:]\n:fact1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :fact0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:fact[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the process of photosynthesis and why is it important for life on Earth?"
