        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x - 7 = 14. I need to find out what x is. Alright, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the goal is to isolate x on one side of the equation. That means I need to get rid of anything else that's with x. So, looking at the equation, there's a -7 there. Maybe I should start by dealing with that.\n\nIf I have 3x - 7 = 14, and I want to move the -7 to the other side, I think I need to add 7 to both sides to keep the equation balanced. So, if I add 7 to both sides, the equation becomes:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 14 + 7\n\nThe -7 and +7 on the left side cancel each other out, so I'm left with:\n\n3x = 21\n\nOkay, now I have 3x = 21. I need to get x by itself. Since x is being multiplied by 3, I think I should divide both sides by 3 to solve for x. So, dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 21 / 3\n\nOn the left side, 3 divided by 3 is 1, so it's just x. On the right side, 21 divided by 3 is 7. So, x = 7.\n\nWait, but I should check if this is right. Let's plug x = 7 back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 7 = 14\n\nPlugging in x = 7: 3*(7) - 7 = 21 - 7 = 14\n\nYes, that matches the right side. So, x = 7 is the correct solution.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the properties of equality and how to manipulate the equation accordingly. For example, I could add 7 to both sides first, as I did, or I could also take other approaches, but this seems straightforward.\n\nI think that's it. The solution is x = 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
