        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a train travels 300 miles in 5 hours, and if it keeps up the same speed, how long would it take to travel 450 miles? Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the train's speed. Speed is usually calculated by dividing the distance by the time, right? So, speed equals distance divided by time. In this case, the distance is 300 miles and the time is 5 hours. So, speed = 300 miles / 5 hours = 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow that I know the train's speed is 60 miles per hour, I can figure out how long it would take to travel 450 miles at that same speed. Time is equal to distance divided by speed, so time = 450 miles / 60 miles per hour.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 450 divided by 60. Well, 60 times 7 is 420, and 450 minus 420 is 30. So, 7 hours plus 30 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, which is 0.5 hours. So, total time is 7.5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using proportions. If 300 miles takes 5 hours, then 450 miles would take x hours. So, I can set up a proportion: 300 miles / 5 hours = 450 miles / x hours.\n\nCross-multiplying, 300x = 5 * 450, which is 300x = 2250. Then, x = 2250 / 300 = 7.5 hours. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me just double-check. Is there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe considering different factors like stops or speed changes, but the problem says the train maintains the same speed, so I don't think so.\n\nSo, the answer should be 7.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
