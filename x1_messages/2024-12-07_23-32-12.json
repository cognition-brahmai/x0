        "content": "To find the average speed of the plane, I need to use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time. The distance between New York and Los Angeles is given as approximately 2450 miles, and the flight time is about 5 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the time is in hours since the speed is to be in miles per hour. The flight time is 5 hours and 45 minutes. I know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so I can convert 45 minutes into hours by dividing 45 by 60.\n\n45 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.75 hours\n\nSo, the total time in hours is 5 hours + 0.75 hours = 5.75 hours.\n\nNow, I can plug the values into the formula:\n\nAverage speed = total distance \u00f7 total time\n\nAverage speed = 2450 miles \u00f7 5.75 hours\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n2450 \u00f7 5.75\n\nTo make it easier, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n(2450 \u00d7 100) \u00f7 (5.75 \u00d7 100) = 245,000 \u00f7 575\n\nNow, divide 245,000 by 575.\n\nLet me see:\n\n575 \u00d7 400 = 230,000\n\nSubtract that from 245,000: 245,000 - 230,000 = 15,000\n\nNow, 575 \u00d7 26 = 14,950\n\nSubtract that from 15,000: 15,000 - 14,950 = 50\n\nSo, the quotient is 426 with a remainder of 50.\n\nTherefore, 245,000 \u00f7 575 \u2248 426.426...\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, say two:\n\n426.43 miles per hour\n\nBut, considering that speeds are often given without many decimal places, I can round it to the nearest whole number:\n\n426 mph\n\nWait a minute, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal distance = 2450 miles\n\nTotal time = 5 hours and 45 minutes = 5.75 hours\n\nAverage speed = 2450 \u00f7 5.75\n\nCalculating 2450 \u00f7 5.75:\n\nOne way to simplify is to multiply numerator and denominator by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n(2450 \u00d7 4) \u00f7 (5.75 \u00d7 4) = 9800 \u00f7 23\n\nNow, divide 9800 by 23.\n\n23 \u00d7 426 = 9798\n\nSubtract: 9800 - 9798 = 2\n\nSo, 23 goes into 9800 426 times with a remainder of 2.\n\nTherefore, 9800 \u00f7 23 = 426.0869...\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 426.09 mph\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number: 426 mph\n\nSo, the average speed of the plane is approximately 426 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{426} \\]"
