        "content": "So there are 60 houses in the village, and each house has a dog. That part seems straightforward. But then it says every third house has a cat. So, I need to figure out how many cats there are in total.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"every third house\" means. Does it mean that for every three houses, one of them has a cat? Or is it that every house whose number is divisible by three has a cat?\n\nAssuming that the houses are numbered sequentially from 1 to 60, then every house where the number is divisible by 3 has a cat. So, for example, house numbers 3, 6, 9, up to 60 would have cats.\n\nTo find out how many such houses there are, I can divide the total number of houses by 3.\n\nSo, 60 divided by 3 is 20. That means there are 20 houses that have a cat.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"every house has a dog, and every third house has a cat.\" Does that mean that some houses might have both a dog and a cat?\n\nFrom the wording, it seems that every house has a dog, and in addition, every third house has a cat. So, yes, those 20 houses that have a cat also have a dog.\n\nSo, the total number of cats would be equal to the number of houses that have a cat, which is 20.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe \"every third house has a cat\" means that only every third house has a cat, and the other houses don't have cats. So, in that case, only those 20 houses have cats, and the remaining 40 houses don't have cats.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cats in the village would be 20.\n\nWait a minute, but perhaps some houses have more than one cat. The question doesn't specify that each of these houses has only one cat. It just says \"every third house has a cat.\" So, maybe some houses have multiple cats.\n\nHowever, since it doesn't specify that, I think the default assumption should be that each of these houses has one cat.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"every third house has a cat\" means that in every set of three houses, one house has a cat, and that cat could be in any of the three houses.\n\nBut I think the straightforward interpretation is that every house whose number is divisible by 3 has a cat.\n\nSo, houses 3, 6, 9, ..., up to 60 have cats.\n\nTo find out how many that is, I can list them out: 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48,51,54,57,60. That's 20 houses.\n\nTherefore, there are 20 cats in the village.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose the houses are not numbered, and \"every third house\" is determined by some other pattern. For example, maybe it's every third house in a row, regardless of numbering.\n\nBut even then, if there are 60 houses, and every third house has a cat, it should still be 20 houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the houses are arranged in a circle, and \"every third house\" means moving in a circular pattern.\n\nBut unless specified, I think it's safe to assume that \"every third house\" means every house whose number is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 20 cats in the village.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
