Here's how I might word it:\n\n---\n\nTo the People of Gotham,\n\nAs the shadows lengthen and the air grows crisp, another Halloween approaches\u2014a time when the line between reality and fantasy blurs. While many look forward to this night with excitement and anticipation, it is crucial to remember that beneath the masks and behind the jack-o'-lanterns, dangers may lurk.\n\nThis year, more than ever, we must be vigilant. The streets of Gotham are no stranger to darkness, but on this night, it is our responsibility to ensure that our loved ones, especially our children, are protected from any harm.\n\nHere are some essential tips to keep in mind as you venture out into the night:\n\n1. **Stay Together:** Always accompany your children while trick-or-treating. There is safety in numbers, and it is easier to keep an eye on everyone when you are together.\n\n2. **Plan Your Route:** Choose well-lit areas and familiar neighborhoods. Avoid alleys and dark corners where mischief can hide.\n\n3. **Visible Costumes:** Ensure that costumes are bright and visible. Add reflective tape or stickers to bags and costumes to make sure you are seen by drivers.\n\n4. **Safe Treats:** Inspect all candy before allowing your children to eat it.

On this Halloween, let us unite in our commitment to protect one another and make this night a memorable one for all the right reasons.\n\nRemember, the true spirit of Halloween is about community, courage, and the unyielding light of hope in the face of darkness.\n\nStay safe, Gotham.
