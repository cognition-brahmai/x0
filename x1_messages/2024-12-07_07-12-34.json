        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 widgets every day, and each widget weighs 5 pounds. So, first, I need to find out how many widgets are produced in a week.\n\nSince the factory operates 6 days a week, the weekly production would be:\n\n200 widgets/day \u00d7 6 days/week = 1200 widgets/week\n\nNow, each widget weighs 5 pounds, so the total weight per week would be:\n\n1200 widgets/week \u00d7 5 pounds/widget = 6000 pounds/week\n\nNext, I need to find out how many weeks the factory operates in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, and the factory takes 2 weeks off for maintenance. So, the number of operating weeks is:\n\n52 weeks/year - 2 weeks/year = 50 weeks/year\n\nNow, to find the total production in pounds for the year, I multiply the weekly production by the number of operating weeks:\n\n6000 pounds/week \u00d7 50 weeks/year = 300,000 pounds/year\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of days the factory operates in a year and then find the total production.\n\nFirst, find the number of operating days per week:\n\n6 days/week\n\nThen, find the number of operating weeks per year:\n\n52 weeks/year - 2 weeks/year = 50 weeks/year\n\nSo, total operating days per year:\n\n6 days/week \u00d7 50 weeks/year = 300 days/year\n\nNow, multiply the daily production by the number of operating days:\n\n200 widgets/day \u00d7 300 days/year = 60,000 widgets/year\n\nEach widget weighs 5 pounds, so:\n\n60,000 widgets/year \u00d7 5 pounds/widget = 300,000 pounds/year\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the factory produces 300,000 pounds of widgets in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300000} \\]"
