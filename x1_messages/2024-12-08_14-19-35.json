        "content": "So I have this problem here: In a class of 50 students, 22 play football, 26 play basketball, and 14 play both games. I need to find out how many students don't play either game. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many students play at least one of the two sports: football or basketball. Since some students play both, I can't just add the number of football players and basketball players together because that would count the students who play both sports twice. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nI recall there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here. It says that to find the total number of elements in two sets, you add the sizes of the individual sets and then subtract the size of their intersection. In formula terms, it's:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the number of students who play either football or basketball.\n\n- |A| is the number of football players.\n\n- |B| is the number of basketball players.\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of students who play both sports.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n|A \u222a B| = 22 (football) + 26 (basketball) - 14 (both) = 48 - 14 = 34 students play either football or basketball.\n\nNow, the total number of students in the class is 50. So, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I subtract the number of students who play at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\n50 (total students) - 34 (play at least one sport) = 16 students don't play either sport.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to use a Venn diagram. I can visualize the students who play football, basketball, and both.\n\nLet's say:\n\n- The number of students who play only football is 22 (total football players) minus 14 (who play both), so 8 students.\n\n- The number of students who play only basketball is 26 (total basketball players) minus 14 (who play both), so 12 students.\n\n- The number of students who play both is 14.\n\nSo, the total number of students who play at least one sport is 8 (only football) + 12 (only basketball) + 14 (both) = 34 students.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total number of students: 50 - 34 = 16 students who don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer. That makes sense. But just to be thorough, maybe I can consider the possibility that some students might play other sports not mentioned here, but the problem specifically talks about football and basketball, so I think it's safe to assume that only these two sports are being considered.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of sets and calculate the complement. If the universal set is all 50 students, and the set of students who play at least one sport is 34, then the complement, which is students who don't play any sport, would be 50 - 34 = 16.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem is pretty straightforward: it gives me the total number of students, the number who play each sport, and the number who play both. I've used that information to find out how many play at least one sport and then found the number who don't play any sport.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap beyond just the students who play both sports. But according to the problem, 14 play both football and basketball, so I think that's all the information I need.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there are any students who might be playing neither sport. The problem doesn't provide any direct information about them, but it gives enough information to calculate their number, which is what I've done.\n\nSo, my final answer is 16 students don't play either game.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
