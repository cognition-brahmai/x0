        "content": "So I've got this problem here about choosing between solid wood doors and composite doors for a new residential complex with 500 apartment units. Each unit needs 5 doors, so that's a total of 2,500 doors for the whole complex. The solid wood doors cost $250 each, and the composite ones cost $150 each. But, the solid wood doors are expected to last twice as long as the composite ones. I need to figure out which one is more cost-effective over a 20-year period, considering both the initial investment and any replacement costs.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of doors needed. With 500 units and 5 doors each, that's:\n\n500 units * 5 doors/unit = 2,500 doors\n\nNow, for the solid wood doors:\n\nCost per door: $250\n\nFor composite doors:\n\nCost per door: $150\n\nSo, the initial total cost for solid wood doors would be:\n\n2,500 doors * $250-door = $625,000\n\nAnd for composite doors:\n\n2,500 doors * $150-door = $375,000\n\nAt first glance, the composite doors seem cheaper by $250,000. But, since solid wood doors last twice as long, I need to factor in the replacement costs over 20 years.\n\nLet's assume that the composite doors need to be replaced once every X years, and the solid wood doors last 2X years. Over 20 years, I need to find out how many times each type would need to be replaced.\n\nFirst, I need to know the lifespan of each type of door. Let's denote:\n\nLifespan of composite doors: Y years\n\nLifespan of solid wood doors: 2Y years\n\nThen, over 20 years, the number of replacements for composite doors would be:\n\nNumber of replacements for composite = ceiling(20 / Y)\n\nAnd for solid wood doors:\n\nNumber of replacements for solid wood = ceiling(20 / 2Y) = ceiling(10 / Y)\n\nWait, actually, that's not quite right. Let's think about it differently.\n\nIf composite doors last Y years, then in 20 years, the number of times they need to be replaced is:\n\nNumber of replacements for composite = floor(20 / Y)\n\nSimilarly, for solid wood doors lasting 2Y years, the number of replacements in 20 years is:\n\nNumber of replacements for solid wood = floor(20 / 2Y) = floor(10 / Y)\n\nBut actually, it's a bit more nuanced because if the lifespan doesn't divide evenly into 20 years, there might be an extra replacement needed. So, it's better to use the ceiling function to account for any partial period requiring an additional replacement.\n\nSo, corrected:\n\nNumber of replacements for composite = ceil(20 / Y)\n\nNumber of replacements for solid wood = ceil(20 / 2Y) = ceil(10 / Y)\n\nNow, the total cost for each type would be:\n\nTotal cost for composite = initial cost + (number of replacements - 1) * replacement cost\n\nSimilarly for solid wood.\n\nWait, actually, the initial installation is considered the first \"replacement,\" so the total cost would be:\n\nTotal cost = number of replacements * cost per replacement\n\nBecause each time you replace, you're installing a new set of doors.\n\nSo, for composite doors:\n\nTotal cost for composite = ceil(20 / Y) * (2,500 doors * $150)\n\nSimilarly, for solid wood doors:\n\nTotal cost for solid wood = ceil(10 / Y) * (2,500 doors * $250)\n\nBut I don't know the value of Y, the lifespan of composite doors. I need to make an assumption here to proceed.\n\nMaybe I can express the total cost in terms of Y and then compare.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that over the 20-year period, the solid wood doors will need to be replaced half as many times as the composite doors, given their lifespan is twice as long.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's assume that the lifespan of composite doors is Y years, then solid wood doors last 2Y years.\n\nOver 20 years, the number of times composite doors need to be replaced is:\n\nNumber of composite replacements = ceil(20 / Y)\n\nAnd for solid wood doors:\n\nNumber of solid wood replacements = ceil(20 / 2Y)\n\nThen, total cost for composite:\n\nTotal composite cost = ceil(20 / Y) * (2,500 * 150)\n\nTotal solid wood cost = ceil(20 / 2Y) * (2,500 * 250)\n\nNow, to compare these, I need to consider different possible values of Y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the cost per year and compare the annualized costs.\n\nBut maybe a simpler approach is to calculate the total cost for both options assuming different lifespans and see which one is cheaper.\n\nLet me consider some possible lifespans for composite doors.\n\nSuppose composite doors last 10 years, then solid wood doors last 20 years.\n\nSo, over 20 years:\n\n- Composite doors would need to be replaced twice (at year 10 and year 20).\n\n- Solid wood doors would need to be replaced once, at year 20.\n\nWait, actually, with ceil(20 / 10) = 2 for composite, and ceil(20 / 20) = 1 for solid wood.\n\nTherefore:\n\nTotal composite cost = 2 * (2,500 * 150) = 2 * 375,000 = $750,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost = 1 * (2,500 * 250) = 1 * 625,000 = $625,000\n\nSo, in this case, solid wood doors are cheaper by $125,000 over 20 years.\n\nWait, but initially, the composite doors seemed cheaper, but with replacements, the solid wood becomes cheaper.\n\nLet me try with a different lifespan.\n\nSuppose composite doors last 15 years, then solid wood last 30 years.\n\nOver 20 years:\n\n- Composite doors need to be replaced ceil(20 / 15) = 2 times\n\n- Solid wood doors need to be replaced ceil(20 / 30) = 1 time\n\nTotal composite cost = 2 * (2,500 * 150) = $750,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost = 1 * (2,500 * 250) = $625,000\n\nAgain, solid wood is cheaper.\n\nWhat if composite doors last 5 years, solid wood last 10 years?\n\nOver 20 years:\n\n- Composite: ceil(20 / 5) = 4 times\n\n- Solid wood: ceil(20 / 10) = 2 times\n\nTotal composite cost = 4 * (2,500 * 150) = $1,500,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost = 2 * (2,500 * 250) = $1,250,000\n\nStill, solid wood is cheaper.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that the first installation might be done at time zero, and subsequent replacements at the end of the lifespan.\n\nIn that case, the timing of costs might differ, but in terms of total cost over 20 years, it seems solid wood is always cheaper in these examples.\n\nLet me try with composite doors lasting 20 years, solid wood lasting 40 years.\n\nOver 20 years:\n\n- Composite: ceil(20 / 20) = 1 time\n\n- Solid wood: ceil(20 / 40) = 1 time\n\nTotal composite cost = 1 * (2,500 * 150) = $375,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost = 1 * (2,500 * 250) = $625,000\n\nIn this case, composite doors are cheaper because only one installation is needed for both types within 20 years.\n\nWait, but solid wood doors could last longer, up to 40 years, so perhaps considering a longer period would change things.\n\nBut the problem specifies a 20-year period.\n\nSo, in this case, composite doors are cheaper.\n\nWait, but earlier, when Y was less than 20, solid wood was cheaper.\n\nWhen Y is 20, composite is cheaper.\n\nWhat if Y is exactly 20 years?\n\nThen, composite: ceil(20 / 20) = 1\n\nSolid wood: ceil(20 / 40) = 1\n\nTotal composite: $375,000\n\nTotal solid wood: $625,000\n\nComposite is cheaper.\n\nBut if Y is slightly less than 20, say 19 years:\n\nComposite: ceil(20 / 19) = 2\n\nSolid wood: ceil(20 / 38) = 1\n\nTotal composite: 2 * $375,000 = $750,000\n\nTotal solid wood: $625,000\n\nSolid wood is cheaper.\n\nSo, there's a crossover point around Y = 20 years.\n\nGiven that, the decision depends on the actual lifespan of composite doors.\n\nIf composite doors last less than 20 years, solid wood is cheaper over 20 years.\n\nIf they last exactly 20 years, composite is cheaper.\n\nIf they last more than 20 years, which isn't likely since solid wood lasts twice as long, but in this case, Y can't be more than 20 years in a 20-year analysis period.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the equivalent annual cost.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to calculate the breakeven lifespan for composite doors where both options have the same total cost over 20 years.\n\nLet me set up an equation.\n\nLet Y be the lifespan of composite doors in years.\n\nThen, solid wood doors last 2Y years.\n\nNumber of composite replacements over 20 years: ceil(20 / Y)\n\nNumber of solid wood replacements: ceil(20 / 2Y)\n\nTotal cost for composite: ceil(20 / Y) * 2,500 * 150\n\nTotal cost for solid wood: ceil(20 / 2Y) * 2,500 * 250\n\nSet them equal to find the breakeven Y:\n\nceil(20 / Y) * 2,500 * 150 = ceil(20 / 2Y) * 2,500 * 250\n\nSimplify:\n\nceil(20 / Y) * 150 = ceil(10 / Y) * 250\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\nceil(20 / Y) * 3 = ceil(10 / Y) * 5\n\nNow, this equation is a bit tricky because of the ceiling function, but perhaps I can consider Y values that divide evenly into 20 and 10.\n\nLet me try Y = 10 years.\n\nThen, ceil(20 / 10) = 2\n\nCeil(10 / 10) = 1\n\nSo, 2 * 3 = 1 * 5 \u2192 6 = 5, not equal.\n\nY = 5 years.\n\nCeil(20 / 5) = 4\n\nCeil(10 / 5) = 2\n\n4 * 3 = 2 * 5 \u2192 12 = 10, not equal.\n\nY = 4 years.\n\nCeil(20 / 4) = 5\n\nCeil(10 / 4) = 3\n\n5 * 3 = 3 * 5 \u2192 15 = 15, equal.\n\nSo, at Y = 4 years, the total costs are equal.\n\nIf Y < 4 years, composite would need more replacements, making solid wood cheaper.\n\nIf Y > 4 years, composite would need fewer replacements, making it cheaper.\n\nBut, in reality, composite doors are likely to last longer than 4 years.\n\nTypical composite doors have a lifespan of about 15-20 years, while solid wood might last 30-40 years.\n\nGiven that, if Y is around 15-20 years, then as per earlier calculations, composite doors would be cheaper over 20 years.\n\nWait, but according to the breakeven point, if Y > 4 years, composite is cheaper.\n\nBut in the earlier example with Y=10, composite was cheaper.\n\nWait, but with Y=10:\n\nCeil(20 / 10) = 2\n\nCeil(10 / 10) = 1\n\n2 * 3 = 1 * 5 \u2192 6 = 5, which is not equal, but composite has higher total cost in this case.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw that with Y=10, composite total cost is $750,000, solid wood is $625,000, so solid wood is cheaper.\n\nBut according to the equation, at Y=4, costs are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal cost composite: ceil(20 / Y) * 2,500 * 150\n\nTotal cost solid wood: ceil(20 / 2Y) * 2,500 * 250\n\nSet equal:\n\nceil(20 / Y) * 150 = ceil(10 / Y) * 250\n\nNow, perhaps instead of trying specific values, I can consider that ceil(20 / Y) is approximately 20 / Y, but ceil function complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that over 20 years, the number of replacements is roughly 20 / Y for composite and 10 / Y for solid wood, and use that for approximation.\n\nThen, the total cost for composite would be (20 / Y) * 375,000\n\nAnd for solid wood: (10 / Y) * 625,000\n\nSet equal:\n\n(20 / Y) * 375,000 = (10 / Y) * 625,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 * 375,000 = 10 * 625,000\n\nWhich is 7,500,000 = 6,250,000, which is not equal.\n\nThis suggests that without the ceiling function, the costs don't equalize, which indicates that the ceiling function is crucial here.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving the equation with ceiling functions, perhaps it's better to consider different likely lifespans for composite doors and see which option is cheaper in each case.\n\nLet's consider Y = 5, 10, 15, 20 years.\n\nCase 1: Y = 5 years\n\nComposite replacements: ceil(20 / 5) = 4\n\nSolid wood replacements: ceil(20 / 10) = 2\n\nTotal composite cost: 4 * 375,000 = $1,500,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost: 2 * 625,000 = $1,250,000\n\nSolid wood is cheaper by $250,000\n\nCase 2: Y = 10 years\n\nComposite replacements: ceil(20 / 10) = 2\n\nSolid wood replacements: ceil(20 / 20) = 1\n\nTotal composite cost: 2 * 375,000 = $750,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost: 1 * 625,000 = $625,000\n\nSolid wood is cheaper by $125,000\n\nCase 3: Y = 15 years\n\nComposite replacements: ceil(20 / 15) = 2\n\nSolid wood replacements: ceil(20 / 30) = 1\n\nTotal composite cost: 2 * 375,000 = $750,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost: 1 * 625,000 = $625,000\n\nSolid wood is cheaper by $125,000\n\nCase 4: Y = 20 years\n\nComposite replacements: ceil(20 / 20) = 1\n\nSolid wood replacements: ceil(20 / 40) = 1\n\nTotal composite cost: 1 * 375,000 = $375,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost: 1 * 625,000 = $625,000\n\nComposite is cheaper by $250,000\n\nCase 5: Y = 25 years\n\nComposite replacements: ceil(20 / 25) = 1\n\nSolid wood replacements: ceil(20 / 50) = 1\n\nTotal composite cost: 1 * 375,000 = $375,000\n\nTotal solid wood cost: 1 * 625,000 = $625,000\n\nComposite is cheaper by $250,000\n\nFrom these cases, it seems that when the composite doors last less than or equal to 20 years, solid wood is cheaper, except when they last exactly 20 years or more, in which case composite is cheaper.\n\nHowever, in reality, composite doors typically last around 15-20 years, while solid wood doors can last 30-40 years.\n\nGiven that, in most scenarios, solid wood doors would be more cost-effective over a 20-year period due to fewer replacements.\n\nBut, if composite doors last exactly 20 years or more, then they become cheaper.\n\nAdditionally, other factors should be considered, such as maintenance costs, durability, and customer preferences.\n\nBut based solely on the initial and replacement costs over 20 years, solid wood doors seem to offer better value unless the composite doors last the full 20 years without needing replacement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Solid wood doors are more cost-effective over a 20-year period unless composite doors last the full 20 years without replacement.}}"
