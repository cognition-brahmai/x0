        "content": "The quote \"It is never too late to be what you might have been\" is often attributed to the British poet and writer George Eliot, whose real name was Mary Anne Evans. This phrase appears in her novel \"Middlemarch\" (1871-1872), specifically in the final chapter, where it is part of a longer passage reflecting on the possibilities and regrets of life. The full sentence is: \"It is never too late to be what you might have been.\" This quote encourages people to believe that no matter their age or past experiences, they can still achieve their potential and become the person they always wanted to be."
