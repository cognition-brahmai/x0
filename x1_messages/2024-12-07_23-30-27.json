        "content": "Jellyfish, gelatinous marvels of the sea, have graced Earth's oceans for over 500 million years. These ethereal creatures, with their pulsating bells and trailing tentacles, are both mesmerizing and mysterious. Some species are bioluminescent, lighting up the ocean depths like living lanterns. Despite their delicate appearance, jellyfish are formidable predators, capturing prey with stinging cells called nematocysts. Their life cycles are complex, often involving multiple stages and forms. In recent years, jellyfish blooms have become more frequent, raising questions about their role in a changing marine ecosystem."
