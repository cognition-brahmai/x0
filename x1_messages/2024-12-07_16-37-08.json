        "content": "So I've got this series to figure out: the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1 over n squared, right? So, \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) for n=1 to \u221e. I need to determine if this thing converges or diverges. Now, I remember there are various tests to check for convergence of series, like the ratio test, the root test, the comparison test, and so on. But I'm not sure which one to use here.\n\nFirst off, let's see what the series looks like. For n=1, it's 1/1\u00b2=1; for n=2, it's 1/4=0.25; for n=3, it's 1/9\u22480.111; and it keeps going like that, getting smaller and smaller as n increases. It seems like the terms are decreasing towards zero, which is a good sign, but I know that doesn't necessarily mean the series converges. For example, the harmonic series \u03a3(1/n) diverges even though 1/n approaches zero.\n\nSo, maybe I can compare this series to the harmonic series. But I think this series might converge because the terms are decreasing faster than 1/n. Instead of 1/n, it's 1/n\u00b2, which gets small quicker. Is there a way to formalize that?\n\nI recall something about p-series. A p-series is of the form \u03a3(1/n^p), where p is a positive constant. And I think I remember that if p > 1, the series converges, and if p \u2264 1, it diverges. In this case, p=2, which is greater than 1, so that would suggest that this series converges.\n\nBut let's see if I can confirm that using a convergence test. Maybe the integral test would work here. The integral test says that if you have a series \u03a3a_n where a_n = f(n), and f is a positive, continuous, and decreasing function for x \u2265 N, then the series converges if and only if the integral from N to infinity of f(x) dx converges.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 1/n\u00b2, so f(x) = 1/x\u00b2. This function is positive, continuous, and decreasing for x \u2265 1. So, I can apply the integral test.\n\nLet's compute the integral from 1 to infinity of 1/x\u00b2 dx.\n\nFirst, it's an improper integral, so I need to handle it carefully. The integral from 1 to t of 1/x\u00b2 dx, and then take the limit as t approaches infinity.\n\n\u222b(1 to t) x^(-2) dx = [-1/x] from 1 to t = -1/t - (-1/1) = -1/t + 1.\n\nNow, take the limit as t approaches infinity: lim (t\u2192\u221e) (-1/t + 1) = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSince the integral converges to 1, which is a finite value, the series also converges by the integral test.\n\nAlright, that's one way to show it. But maybe there are other tests I can use to confirm this.\n\nAnother test that comes to mind is the comparison test. Since I know that the harmonic series \u03a3(1/n) diverges, and my series has terms 1/n\u00b2, which are smaller than 1/n for n \u2265 1, but smaller terms could still lead to a divergent series, like the harmonic series itself.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the comparison test says that if 0 \u2264 a_n \u2264 b_n for all n, and \u03a3b_n converges, then \u03a3a_n also converges. But in this case, if I take b_n = 1/n\u00b2 and compare it to something else that I know converges.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can compare it to a p-series with p > 1. For example, take p=2, which is exactly my series. Well, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the limit comparison test. Let's say I compare \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) to \u03a3(1/n^p), where p > 1.\n\nLet me choose p=2, so b_n = 1/n\u00b2.\n\nThen, the limit as n approaches infinity of a_n / b_n = (1/n\u00b2) / (1/n\u00b2) = 1.\n\nSince the limit is a positive finite number, and \u03a3b_n converges (because p=2 > 1), then \u03a3a_n also converges.\n\nWait, but that's just repeating myself. I need to compare it to a different series whose convergence is known.\n\nMaybe I can compare it to \u03a3(1/n^(3/2)), which is a p-series with p=3/2 >1, so it converges.\n\nLet's see: for large n, 1/n\u00b2 < 1/n^(3/2), because n\u00b2 > n^(3/2), which implies 1/n\u00b2 < 1/n^(3/2).\n\nSo, 0 \u2264 a_n \u2264 b_n, where b_n = 1/n^(3/2), and \u03a3b_n converges.\n\nTherefore, by the comparison test, \u03a3a_n also converges.\n\nThat's another way to show it.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the ratio test. The ratio test says that if lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_(n+1)/a_n| < 1, then the series converges absolutely.\n\nLet's try that here.\n\na_n = 1/n\u00b2, so a_(n+1) = 1/(n+1)\u00b2.\n\nThen, |a_(n+1)/a_n| = [(1/(n+1)\u00b2)/(1/n\u00b2)] = (n\u00b2)/(n+1)\u00b2 = (n/(n+1))\u00b2.\n\nNow, lim (n\u2192\u221e) (n/(n+1))\u00b2 = [lim (n\u2192\u221e) n/(n+1)]\u00b2 = (1)\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the ratio test is inconclusive when the limit is 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio test doesn't help me here.\n\nMaybe the root test? The root test says that if lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^(1/n) <1, then the series converges absolutely.\n\nLet's try it.\n\na_n = 1/n\u00b2, so |a_n|^(1/n) = (1/n\u00b2)^(1/n) = 1^(1/n) / n^(2/n) = 1 / n^(2/n).\n\nNow, lim (n\u2192\u221e) n^(2/n). I need to find this limit.\n\nI know that lim (n\u2192\u221e) n^(1/n) = 1. So, lim n^(2/n) = [n^(1/n)]\u00b2 = 1\u00b2 =1.\n\nTherefore, lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^(1/n) = 1 /1 =1.\n\nAgain, the root test is inconclusive when the limit is 1.\n\nSo, the ratio test and the root test don't help in this case.\n\nBack to the integral test, which did show convergence.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the partial sums of the series.\n\nThe partial sum s_k = \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) from n=1 to k.\n\nI need to see if s_k approaches a finite limit as k approaches infinity.\n\nBut calculating s_k directly seems tricky.\n\nWait, I recall that this particular series, \u03a3(1/n\u00b2), is known as the Basel problem.\n\nI think it was solved by Euler, who showed that the sum is \u03c0\u00b2/6.\n\nIf that's the case, then it definitely converges to \u03c0\u00b2/6.\n\nBut even without knowing the exact sum, I can still determine that it converges.\n\nGiven that I've used the integral test and the comparison test to show convergence, and knowing that it's a well-known convergent series, I'm confident that \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) converges.\n\nJust to make sure, is there any other test I should consider?\n\nMaybe the Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test says that for a decreasing sequence a_n, the series \u03a3a_n converges if and only if \u03a32^k a_(2^k) converges.\n\nLet's try that here.\n\na_n = 1/n\u00b2, so 2^k a_(2^k) = 2^k / (2^k)\u00b2 = 2^k / 2^(2k) = 2^(-k).\n\nSo, \u03a32^k a_(2^k) = \u03a32^(-k) from k=0 to \u221e, which is a geometric series with ratio 1/2.\n\nSince the ratio is less than 1, the geometric series converges.\n\nTherefore, by the Cauchy condensation test, the original series \u03a3a_n also converges.\n\nAlright, that's yet another confirmation.\n\nI think I've used enough tests to be sure that the series converges.\n\nJust for completeness, I'll mention that this series is also convergent by the p-series test, since p=2 >1.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the series \u03a3(1/n\u00b2) from n=1 to infinity converges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{converges}}"
