        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and the owner wants to build a fence around it with a gate that's 4 feet wide. I need to figure out the total length of the fence needed, but excluding the gate. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So, the total perimeter of the garden without any gates would be the sum of all four sides. That means:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * length + 2 * width\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * 30 feet + 2 * 20 feet = 60 feet + 40 feet = 100 feet\n\nSo, the entire perimeter is 100 feet. But there's a gate that's 4 feet wide, and we need to exclude that from the total fence length. So, I think I just need to subtract the width of the gate from the total perimeter.\n\nTotal fence length = Perimeter - width of the gate = 100 feet - 4 feet = 96 feet\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine the garden is a rectangle. The fence goes around it, but instead of fence on the entire perimeter, there's a gate that's 4 feet wide. So, the fence covers the perimeter minus the 4 feet where the gate is.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the total length of the fence needed would indeed be 100 feet minus 4 feet, which is 96 feet.\n\nBut maybe I should consider where the gate is placed. Does it matter if the gate is on the length or the width side? Let's see.\n\nIf the gate is on the longer side (30 feet), then the fence would cover one side of 30 feet minus 4 feet for the gate, and the other three sides fully.\n\nSo, fence length = (30 - 4) feet + 30 feet + 20 feet + 20 feet = 26 feet + 30 feet + 20 feet + 20 feet = 96 feet\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is on the shorter side (20 feet), then:\n\nFence length = 30 feet + 30 feet + (20 - 4) feet + 20 feet = 30 feet + 30 feet + 16 feet + 20 feet = 96 feet\n\nSo, whether the gate is on the length or the width, the total fence length comes out to be the same: 96 feet.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, it doesn't matter where the gate is placed; the total fence length needed is still 96 feet.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to think about it. Perhaps the gate affects the perimeter differently depending on its position. Let's consider that.\n\nIf the gate is on the longer side, then the fence has one side with a 4-foot gap, and the other three sides are fully fenced. Similarly, if it's on the shorter side, one side has a 4-foot gap, and the others are fully fenced.\n\nIn both cases, the total fence length is the same. So, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the fence length. For example, does the gate require any additional fencing on its sides? But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that the gate just replaces a 4-foot section of the fence.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that the gate is 4 feet wide, which I interpret as the gate spanning 4 feet of the perimeter. So, again, subtracting 4 feet from the total perimeter seems accurate.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe using the formula for the perimeter and then subtracting the gate width.\n\nPerimeter P = 2*L + 2*W = 2*30 + 2*20 = 60 + 40 = 100 feet\n\nFence length F = P - gate width = 100 - 4 = 96 feet\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the fence length by adding up the sides manually, excluding the gate.\n\nAssuming the gate is on the length side:\n\nFence on that side: 30 - 4 = 26 feet\n\nPlus the other length: 30 feet\n\nPlus both widths: 20 + 20 = 40 feet\n\nTotal: 26 + 30 + 40 = 96 feet\n\nSame result.\n\nIf the gate is on the width side:\n\nFence on that side: 20 - 4 = 16 feet\n\nPlus the other width: 20 feet\n\nPlus both lengths: 30 + 30 = 60 feet\n\nTotal: 16 + 20 + 60 = 96 feet\n\nAgain, 96 feet.\n\nSo, no matter where the gate is placed, the total fence length needed is 96 feet.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The problem seems straightforward, and my calculations confirm that the total fence length needed, excluding the gate, is 96 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
