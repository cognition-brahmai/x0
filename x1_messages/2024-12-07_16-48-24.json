        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two products, A and B, with different profit per unit: $20 for A and $30 for B. The company wants to make at least $10,000 in profit by selling no more than 400 units in total. We need to find the minimum number of product B units they must sell to meet these goals.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of units of product A.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of units of product B.\n\nNow, we have a couple of constraints:\n\n1. The total number of units sold should not exceed 400:\n\n   \\[ x + y \\leq 400 \\]\n\n2. The total profit should be at least $10,000. Since product A brings in $20 per unit and product B brings in $30 per unit, the total profit can be expressed as:\n\n   \\[ 20x + 30y \\geq 10,000 \\]\n\nOur goal is to minimize the number of product B units, which means minimizing \\( y \\).\n\nTo minimize \\( y \\), we need to maximize \\( x \\), because product A contributes less to the profit per unit compared to product B. However, since product B contributes more to the profit, selling more of product B allows us to meet the profit target with fewer units.\n\nBut in this case, we want the minimum \\( y \\), so we need to find the smallest \\( y \\) such that the total profit is at least $10,000, while keeping \\( x + y \\leq 400 \\).\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange the profit equation to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 20x + 30y \\geq 10,000 \\]\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3y \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\nNow, let\u2019s express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) using the total units constraint:\n\n\\[ x = 400 - y \\]\n\nSubstitute this into the simplified profit equation:\n\n\\[ 2(400 - y) + 3y \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 800 - 2y + 3y \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 800 + y \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\n\\[ y \\geq 200 \\]\n\nSo, the company must sell at least 200 units of product B to achieve a profit of at least $10,000 while selling no more than 400 units in total.\n\nLet\u2019s verify this:\n\nIf \\( y = 200 \\), then \\( x = 400 - 200 = 200 \\).\n\nTotal profit:\n\n\\[ 20(200) + 30(200) = 4,000 + 6,000 = 10,000 \\]\n\nWhich meets the minimum profit requirement.\n\nIf we try \\( y = 199 \\), then \\( x = 400 - 199 = 201 \\).\n\nTotal profit:\n\n\\[ 20(201) + 30(199) = 4,020 + 5,970 = 9,990 \\]\n\nWhich is less than $10,000, so 199 units of B are not sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of product B units the company must sell is 200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
