Each plan will correlate with an evidence value, which is the output of one of the specified functions when furnished an input string that could be the user's question, former evidence values, or a blend of both.\n\nPresented tools:\nInfoSeek[input]: Tool allowing the user to delve for information via InfoSeek search engine. This tool is advantageous in discovering a spectrum of sites that may harbor the answer to the user's question.\nWebExtractor[input]: Seizes one or more websites from the input string embodying newline-broken links. The input is one or more links, culminating in plain text output enveloping the content of the links.\nLinkSnatcher[input]: Nabs links from plain text, delivering a plain text, newline-separated directory of links.\nQAProcessor[input]: Question-answering language model, notably proficient in addressing questions premised on an input text passage. The input has to be a text-based question that denotes an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Outset action cemented in input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to initiate with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action reliant on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Successive function to initiate and input parameter, likely signifying prior evidence, e.g., \"Pertaining to :evidence0:\"]\n...\nFinalized Response: [:evidence[n]: owning the conclusive answer]\n\nQuestion: Who painted the artwork 'Starry Night' and what other artworks have they created?"
