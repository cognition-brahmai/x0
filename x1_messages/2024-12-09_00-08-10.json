        "content": "So, we've got this scenario with 50 houses numbered from 1 to 50, and there's a rule that no two neighboring houses can have consecutive numbers. House number 50 is at the end of the street and only has one neighbor. The question is, how many neighbors does house number 1 have?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout of the houses. Since house number 50 is at the end of the street and has only one neighbor, it suggests that the houses are arranged in a linear fashion, like a straight line, with house 50 at one end.\n\nIn a linear arrangement, each house has two neighbors except for the houses at the ends. The house at the starting end (which I assume is house number 1) would have only one neighbor, just like house number 50.\n\nSo, if house 50 has only one neighbor, then house 1 should also have only one neighbor.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe the arrangement is different. Perhaps the houses are arranged in a circle, where each house has two neighbors, except something is different because house 50 has only one neighbor. Wait, the problem says house 50 is at the end of the street, so it's more likely a linear arrangement.\n\nIn a linear arrangement:\n\n- House 1 neighbors with house 2.\n\n- House 2 neighbors with house 1 and house 3.\n\n- House 3 neighbors with house 2 and house 4.\n\n- ...\n\n- House 49 neighbors with house 48 and house 50.\n\n- House 50 neighbors with house 49.\n\nSo, in this setup, house 1 has only one neighbor, which is house 2.\n\nNow, the rule is that no two neighboring houses can have consecutive numbers. So, house 1 (number 1) cannot have a neighbor with number 2, but in this arrangement, house 1 is neighboring house 2, which has number 2. That would violate the rule.\n\nWait, that's confusing. According to the arrangement I just described, house 1 has number 1 and neighbors house 2 with number 2, which are consecutive, violating the rule.\n\nMaybe the house numbers don't correspond to their positions on the street. Perhaps the house numbers are assigned arbitrarily to the houses along the street, as long as the rule is satisfied.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Each house has a number from 1 to 50.\" It doesn't specify that the house numbers increase sequentially along the street. So, the house numbers are just labels, and their positions on the street can be arranged such that no two neighboring houses have consecutive numbers.\n\nGiven that, the question is how many neighbors house number 1 has.\n\nGiven that the houses are in a linear arrangement, with house 50 at one end with only one neighbor, house number 1, being another end house, should also have only one neighbor.\n\nBut wait, if house 50 is at one end, and the houses are numbered from 1 to 50 along the street, then house 1 would be at the other end, also with only one neighbor.\n\nHowever, earlier I realized that if house 1 is numbered 1 and is at one end, neighboring house 2, which would be numbered 2, that would violate the rule of not having consecutive numbers on neighboring houses.\n\nSo, perhaps the house numbers are not in sequential order along the street.\n\nMaybe house 1 is somewhere in the middle of the street, but that seems unlikely because house 50 is specified to be at the end.\n\nWait, the problem says \"house number 50 is at the end of the street and has only one neighbor.\" It doesn't specify the position of house number 1.\n\nPerhaps house number 50 is at one end, and house number 1 is at the other end, but with non-consecutive numbering.\n\nFor example, house 50 is at one end, neighboring house 49, and house 1 is at the other end, neighboring house 2.\n\nBut again, if house 1 is numbered 1 and neighbors house 2 (numbered 2), that would violate the rule.\n\nSo, perhaps the house numbers are assigned in a way that house 1 is not numbered 1, but some other number, to avoid having consecutive numbers on neighboring houses.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"each house has a number from 1 to 50,\" so house 1 has number 1, house 2 has number 2, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe not. Maybe the house numbers are assigned arbitrarily between 1 and 50, meaning that house 1 could have any number from 1 to 50, as long as all numbers are unique.\n\nIf that's the case, then house 1 could have number 1, and its neighbor could have any number except 2.\n\nBut the problem refers to \"house number 1,\" which might mean the house with number 1, not necessarily house 1 in the street arrangement.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n\"In a town, there are 50 houses. Each house has a number from 1 to 50. There is a rule that no two neighboring houses can have consecutive numbers. House number 50 is at the end of the street and has only one neighbor. How many neighbors does house number 1 have? Explain your reasoning.\"\n\nOkay, so \"house number 50\" refers to the house with the number 50, and it's located at the end of the street with only one neighbor.\n\nThe question is about \"house number 1,\" meaning the house with number 1, not necessarily the first house on the street.\n\nSo, perhaps the houses are arranged in a way that their numbers don't increase sequentially along the street.\n\nGiven that, house number 50 is at one end with only one neighbor, and house number 1 is somewhere in the street, and we need to find out how many neighbors it has.\n\nBut in a linear arrangement, only the houses at the ends have one neighbor, while the rest have two.\n\nSo, if house number 50 is at one end with one neighbor, and house number 1 is at the other end with one neighbor, then house number 1 has one neighbor.\n\nBut wait, if house number 50 is at one end, and house number 1 is at the other end, then both have one neighbor each.\n\nHowever, earlier I thought that if house number 1 is at the other end, neighboring house number 2, but if house number 1 is neighboring house number 2, that would violate the rule, unless house number 2 is not actually number 2, but some other number.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that the house numbers are assigned to positions along the street, and the positions are from 1 to 50, with position 1 at one end and position 50 at the other end.\n\nHouse at position 1 has number X, and house at position 50 has number Y, where Y is 50.\n\nGiven that house number 50 is at position 50, which has only one neighbor, the house at position 49.\n\nNow, house number 1 is the house with number 1, which could be at any position from 1 to 49, since position 50 is house number 50.\n\nThe question is, how many neighbors does the house with number 1 have?\n\nGiven that, I need to find out at which position the house with number 1 is located, and then determine how many neighbors it has based on its position.\n\nBut I don't know the position of house number 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the rules given.\n\nWe have houses in a line, with house number 50 at one end, having only one neighbor.\n\nWe need to assign numbers from 1 to 50 to the houses, with no two neighboring houses having consecutive numbers.\n\nThe question is about the number of neighbors of house number 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the arrangement is such that house number 50 is at one end, and house number 1 is at the other end.\n\nIf that's the case, then house number 1 would have only one neighbor.\n\nBut I need to verify if this is necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe house number 1 is somewhere in the middle, having two neighbors.\n\nBut if house number 1 is in the middle, then its neighbors cannot have numbers 2 and 50, but since 50 is at one end, and assuming that the ends are house number 50 and another house, perhaps house number 1 is at the other end.\n\nLet me try to think of a possible arrangement.\n\nSuppose the houses are arranged in positions 1 to 50, with position 50 being house number 50.\n\nWe need to assign numbers to positions 1 to 49, such that no two neighboring houses have consecutive numbers.\n\nTo maximize the separation, perhaps we can assign the numbers in a way that house number 1 is at position 1, and house number 50 is at position 50, with their numbers being non-consecutive.\n\nWait, house number 50 is already at position 50, and house number 1 is at position 1.\n\nThen, house number 1 would have only one neighbor, which is house at position 2, provided that position 1 is at the end.\n\nBut in this linear arrangement, position 1 is at one end, and position 50 is at the other end, each having only one neighbor.\n\nTherefore, house number 1, being at position 1, has only one neighbor.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that if house number 1 is at position 1, neighboring position 2, which would have house number 2, violating the rule.\n\nHowever, the rule is that no two neighboring houses can have consecutive numbers.\n\nSo, if house number 1 is at position 1, its neighbor at position 2 cannot have number 2.\n\nTherefore, the house at position 2 must have a number other than 2.\n\nSimilarly, house number 50 is at position 50, and its neighbor at position 49 cannot have number 49.\n\nSo, in assigning numbers, we need to ensure that neighboring houses do not have consecutive numbers.\n\nGiven that, it's possible to assign numbers such that house number 1 is at position 1, neighboring position 2, which has a number other than 2.\n\nFor example, position 1: house number 1, position 2: house number 3, position 3: house number 5, and so on.\n\nThis way, no two neighboring houses have consecutive numbers.\n\nTherefore, house number 1 has one neighbor, which is the house at position 2, provided that position 2 has a number that is not consecutive to 1.\n\nThus, house number 1 has one neighbor.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, house number 1 has one neighbor, but what about other houses?\n\nFor example, house number 2 could be at position 3, neighboring position 2 and position 4.\n\nBut in this specific question, we only need to determine the number of neighbors for house number 1.\n\nGiven that, and considering the linear arrangement with house number 50 at one end with one neighbor, it's logical to conclude that house number 1 is at the other end with one neighbor.\n\nTherefore, house number 1 has one neighbor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
