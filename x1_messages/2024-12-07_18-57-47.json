        "content": "In the wizarding world of Harry Potter, a \"muggle\" refers to a person who lacks magical abilities and was not born into a magical family. Muggles are ordinary non-magical people who make up the majority of the world's population. The term is used to distinguish them from witches and wizards, who possess magical powers and typically come from families with a history of magic.\n\nMuggles live alongside witches and wizards but remain unaware of the magical community due to the efforts of the Ministry of Magic, which works to keep the existence of magic hidden from them. This separation is maintained through various enchantments and laws designed to prevent muggles from discovering the wizarding world.\n\nIn the Harry Potter series, muggles are often portrayed as being oblivious to the magical world, but they are also shown to have their own complexities and challenges. Some magical characters, like Hermione Granger, come from muggle families and bridge the gap between the two worlds.\n\nOverall, the term \"muggle\" is an integral part of the Harry Potter universe, defining the relationship between the magical and non-magical populations and highlighting the differences and interactions between them."
