        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, total number of balls is 4 + 3 + 5, which is 12 balls.\n\nThe question is, if you draw two balls at random without replacement, what's the probability that both balls are red.\n\nOkay, so without replacement means that once you draw the first ball, it stays out, and the second ball is drawn from the remaining balls.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to draw two balls out of 12. That's a combination problem, because the order doesn't matter. So, it's \"12 choose 2.\"\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, there are 66 possible ways to draw two balls from 12.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to draw two red balls. There are 4 red balls.\n\nSo, \"4 choose 2\" = C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2!)) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to choose two red balls.\n\nNow, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes (both red) divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = number of ways to choose two red balls / total number of ways to choose any two balls = 6 / 66 = 1/11.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this?\n\nMaybe using probabilities directly.\n\nThe probability that the first ball drawn is red is 4 out of 12, since there are 4 red balls and 12 total balls. So, 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, there are now 3 red balls left and 11 total balls left, since we're not replacing the first ball.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is 3/11.\n\nThen, the probability that both balls are red is the product of these two probabilities: (1/3) \u00d7 (3/11) = (1 \u00d7 3) / (3 \u00d7 11) = 3/33 = 1/11.\n\nOkay, so I get the same answer both ways.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about permutations. But since the order doesn't matter in this case, combinations are the way to go.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let's try it with permutations.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw two balls without replacement is P(12, 2) = 12 \u00d7 11 = 132.\n\nNumber of ways to draw two red balls is P(4, 2) = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nThen, probability = 12 / 132 = 1/11.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the probability is 1/11.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach.\n\nMaybe using complementary probabilities, but that seems more complicated here.\n\nOr using binomial coefficients for more than two draws, but that's not necessary here.\n\nNo, I think this is straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{11}} \\]"
