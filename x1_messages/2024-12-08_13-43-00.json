        "content": "So you've got a fair coin, and you're going to toss it three times. You want to know the probability of getting at least two heads. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what \"at least two heads\" means. It means two heads or more. So in this case, since you're only tossing the coin three times, \"at least two heads\" includes getting exactly two heads or getting exactly three heads.\n\nNext, let's think about the total number of possible outcomes when you toss a coin three times. Each toss has two possible results: heads (H) or tails (T). Since the tosses are independent, the total number of possible outcomes is 2 multiplied by itself three times, which is 2^3 = 8. So there are 8 possible sequences of heads and tails.\n\nLet's list them out to visualize it:\n\n1. HHH\n\n2. HHT\n\n3. HTH\n\n4. HTT\n\n5. THH\n\n6. THT\n\n7. TTH\n\n8. TTT\n\nNow, out of these 8 possible outcomes, we need to count how many of them have at least two heads.\n\nLet's identify the outcomes with exactly two heads:\n\n- HHT\n\n- HTH\n\n- THH\n\nThat's three outcomes.\n\nAnd the outcome with exactly three heads:\n\n- HHH\n\nThat's one outcome.\n\nSo, total number of favorable outcomes is 3 (for two heads) plus 1 (for three heads), which equals 4.\n\nNow, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability of getting at least two heads = number of favorable outcomes / total possible outcomes = 4 / 8 = 0.5.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, you can multiply by 100, which gives 50%.\n\nAlternatively, you can leave it as a fraction, which is 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2 or 50%.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this to make sure we haven't missed anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the binomial probability formula. The probability of getting exactly k successes (heads in this case) in n trials (tosses) is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (3 tosses)\n\n- k is the number of successes (heads)\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (0.5 for a fair coin)\n\n- \"n choose k\" is the binomial coefficient, which is n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSince we want at least two heads, we need to find P(X >= 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)\n\nFirst, calculate P(X = 2):\n\n(n choose 2) * (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^(3-2) = (3 choose 2) * (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^1 = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5 = 3 * 0.125 = 0.375\n\nNext, calculate P(X = 3):\n\n(n choose 3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^(3-3) = (3 choose 3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^0 = 1 * 0.125 * 1 = 0.125\n\nNow, add them up: P(X >= 2) = 0.375 + 0.125 = 0.5\n\nSo, again, we get 0.5 or 50%.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach: calculating the probability of the complementary event and subtracting it from 1.\n\nThe complementary event of \"at least two heads\" is \"less than two heads,\" which means zero heads or one head.\n\nSo, P(X >= 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)]\n\nLet's calculate P(X = 0) and P(X = 1):\n\nP(X = 0):\n\n(3 choose 0) * (0.5)^0 * (0.5)^3 = 1 * 1 * 0.125 = 0.125\n\nP(X = 1):\n\n(3 choose 1) * (0.5)^1 * (0.5)^2 = 3 * 0.5 * 0.25 = 3 * 0.125 = 0.375\n\nNow, P(X < 2) = 0.125 + 0.375 = 0.5\n\nTherefore, P(X >= 2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nOnce again, we arrive at the same answer: 0.5 or 50%.\n\nSo, no matter which method we use, the probability of getting at least two heads in three tosses of a fair coin is 50%.\n\nI hope this step-by-step explanation helps you understand the problem and how to approach it. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
