        "content": "Let's see. I need to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 10 and 20. So, first, I should identify what those even numbers are.\n\nEven numbers are numbers that are divisible by 2 without any remainder. So, starting from 10, which is even, and going up to 20, which is also even.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n\nOkay, those are all the even numbers between 10 and 20 inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to find their sum. I can do this by adding them one by one.\n\nSo, starting with 10 + 12 = 22.\n\nThen, 22 + 14 = 36.\n\nNext, 36 + 16 = 52.\n\nThen, 52 + 18 = 70.\n\nFinally, 70 + 20 = 90.\n\nSo, the sum is 90.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula is (n/2)*(first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm that this is an arithmetic series. Since the numbers are increasing by a constant difference of 2, yes, it is an arithmetic series.\n\nNow, the first term is 10, the last term is 20, and the number of terms is 6 (as listed earlier: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20).\n\nPlugging into the formula: (6/2)*(10 + 20) = 3*30 = 90.\n\nSo, again, the sum is 90.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can check if I missed any even numbers between 10 and 20. Let's see: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. That seems complete. No even numbers are missed.\n\nAlso, I can verify the addition: 10 + 12 = 22, 22 + 14 = 36, 36 + 16 = 52, 52 + 18 = 70, 70 + 20 = 90. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the sum formula for even numbers. The sum of the first n even numbers is n*(n+1). But wait, that's for sum of even numbers starting from 2.\n\nIn this case, I'm summing even numbers starting from 10 to 20, which is a specific range, not from the beginning.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to stick with the arithmetic series formula or manual addition in this case.\n\nAnother way could be to factor out 2 and sum the integers from 5 to 10, since 10 is 2*5 and 20 is 2*10.\n\nSo, sum of even numbers from 10 to 20 is 2*(5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10).\n\nSum inside the parentheses is 5+10 = 15, multiplied by the number of terms, which is 6, divided by 2, so (6/2)*(5 + 10) = 3*15 = 45.\n\nThen, 2*45 = 90.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I get the sum as 90.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all even numbers between 10 and 20 is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
