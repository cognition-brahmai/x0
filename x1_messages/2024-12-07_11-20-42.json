        "content": "The unit that measures the frequency of sound waves is called Hertz, named after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz. It represents the number of cycles per second in a periodic event, such as sound waves. So, when we talk about the frequency of sound, we're referring to how many times per second the sound wave repeats itself. For example, a frequency of 440 Hertz means the sound wave repeats 440 times each second. This is particularly important in music and acoustics, where different frequencies correspond to different musical notes."
