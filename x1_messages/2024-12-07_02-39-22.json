        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 12 red balls, 18 blue balls, and 6 green balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacing the first one, both of them are blue. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. Let's add them up: 12 red + 18 blue + 6 green = 36 balls in total.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. But since we're dealing with picking two balls without replacement, I need to consider how the first pick affects the second pick.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst pick: I want to pick a blue ball. There are 18 blue balls out of 36 total balls. So, the probability of picking a blue ball first is 18/36, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nBut wait, after I pick the first blue ball, I don't replace it, so now there are only 35 balls left in the box, and only 17 of them are blue.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a second blue ball, given that the first one was blue, is 17/35.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together (both picks being blue), I need to multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event given the first.\n\nSo, that would be (18/36) * (17/35).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 18/36 is 1/2.\n\nThen, 1/2 * 17/35 = 17/70.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are blue is 17/70.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this differently to verify.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use combinations. The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 36 is \"36 choose 2\", which is calculated as 36! / (2! * (36-2)!) = (36 * 35)/2 = 630.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 blue balls out of 18 is \"18 choose 2\", which is (18 * 17)/2 = 153.\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being blue is 153 / 630.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 9.\n\n153 \u00f7 9 = 17\n\n630 \u00f7 9 = 70\n\nSo, again, 17/70.\n\nThat matches my earlier result, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probabilities sequentially, as I did first, and multiply them, which also gave me 17/70.\n\nSo, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to tie it all together, the probability that both balls picked are blue is 17/70.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{17}{70}} \\]"
