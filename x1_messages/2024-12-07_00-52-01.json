        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this group of people, and they were asked if they prefer tea or coffee. 60% said they prefer tea, which means the remaining 40% prefer coffee. Now, out of those who prefer tea, 75% also like biscuits. I need to find out what percentage of the total group likes both tea and biscuits.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to find out how many people like tea and biscuits together, in terms of the total group.\n\nLet me denote the total group as 100%. That way, it's easier to work with percentages.\n\nSo, 60% prefer tea.\n\nOut of these 60%, 75% also like biscuits.\n\nSo, to find out how many people like both tea and biscuits, I need to calculate 75% of 60%.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n75% of 60% is (75/100) * 60 = 0.75 * 60 = 45.\n\nSo, 45% of the total group likes both tea and biscuits.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal group: 100%\n\nTea lovers: 60%\n\nCoffee lovers: 40%\n\nAmong tea lovers, 75% like biscuits.\n\nSo, 75% of 60% is indeed 45%.\n\nTherefore, 45% of the total group likes both tea and biscuits.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I have a total of 100 people in the group.\n\nNumber who prefer tea: 60% of 100 = 60 people.\n\nNumber who prefer coffee: 40% of 100 = 40 people.\n\nNow, among the 60 tea lovers, 75% also like biscuits.\n\nSo, number who like both tea and biscuits: 75% of 60 = 0.75 * 60 = 45 people.\n\nTherefore, 45 out of 100 people like both tea and biscuits, which is 45%.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 45%.\n\nI don't think there's any need for further calculation or consideration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45\\%} \\]"
