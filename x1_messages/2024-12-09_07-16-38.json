        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a store sells a pack of 12 pens for $4.80, and I want to buy 60 pens. I need to find out how much it would cost. Okay, first things first, I should figure out how many packs of 12 pens I need to get to reach 60 pens.\n\nSo, if each pack has 12 pens, and I need 60 pens, I can divide 60 by 12 to find out how many packs I need. Let me do that: 60 divided by 12 is 5. So, I need 5 packs of pens.\n\nNow, each pack costs $4.80, and I'm buying 5 packs. To find the total cost, I should multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack. That is, 5 times $4.80.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5 times $4.80. Well, 5 times 4 is 20, and 5 times 0.80 is 4. So, 20 plus 4 equals $24. Therefore, 5 packs would cost $24.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by finding the cost per pen and then multiplying by 60. Let's try that to double-check.\n\nIf a pack of 12 pens costs $4.80, then the cost per pen is $4.80 divided by 12. Let's calculate that: $4.80 divided by 12. 4.80 divided by 12 is $0.40 per pen.\n\nNow, if each pen costs $0.40, then for 60 pens, I would multiply 60 by $0.40. That is, 60 times 0.40.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 60 times 0.40 is the same as 60 times 40 cents, which is 2400 cents. But 100 cents make a dollar, so 2400 cents is $24.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer: $24.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions or something like that.\n\nSuppose I set up a proportion where the cost is directly proportional to the number of pens. So, $4.80 corresponds to 12 pens. I want to find out how much corresponds to 60 pens.\n\nSo, I can set up the proportion: 4.80 / 12 = x / 60.\n\nNow, solve for x. Cross-multiplying, I get 12x = 4.80 times 60.\n\n4.80 times 60 is, let's see, 4 times 60 is 240, and 0.80 times 60 is 48, so total 240 plus 48 is 288.\n\nSo, 12x = 288.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 12: x = 288 / 12.\n\n288 divided by 12 is 24.\n\nAgain, I get $24.\n\nHmm, interesting. All these different approaches are leading me to the same answer. That gives me more confidence that $24 is indeed the correct cost for 60 pens.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using unit pricing or something like that.\n\nUnit pricing is basically finding the price per unit and then scaling it up to the desired quantity. That's similar to what I did earlier when I calculated the cost per pen and then multiplied by 60.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of multiples. For example, if 12 pens cost $4.80, then 24 pens would cost twice that, which is $9.60. Then, 36 pens would cost three times $4.80, which is $14.40, and so on.\n\nBut wait, I already have that: 5 packs of 12 pens each, totaling 60 pens, would cost 5 times $4.80, which is $24.\n\nI think I've covered it from multiple angles, and all paths lead to $24.\n\nIs there any chance that there's a discount for buying in bulk or something like that? The problem doesn't mention any discounts or special offers, so I assume it's just a straightforward calculation.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not missing any hidden costs or additional fees, but again, the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So, I can safely assume that the total cost is $24.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me verify my calculations once more.\n\nFirst method:\n\n- Number of packs needed: 60 / 12 = 5 packs\n\n- Cost per pack: $4.80\n\n- Total cost: 5 * $4.80 = $24\n\nSecond method:\n\n- Cost per pen: $4.80 / 12 = $0.40 per pen\n\n- Total cost for 60 pens: 60 * $0.40 = $24\n\nThird method:\n\n- Proportion: 4.80 / 12 = x / 60\n\n- Solving for x: x = (4.80 * 60) / 12 = 288 / 12 = $24\n\nAll methods confirm the same result. I think it's safe to conclude that buying 60 pens would cost $24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
