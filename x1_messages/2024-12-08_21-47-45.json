        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses on one side of the street and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. Each house has an even number of people living in it, and the total number of people is 100. I need to find out how many people live in the smallest house.\n\nFirst, since each house has an even number of people, that means the number of people in each house could be 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. The smallest possible number is 2.\n\nIf all houses had the smallest possible number of people, which is 2, then the total number of people would be 25 houses times 2 people per house, which is 50 people. But the total is actually 100 people, which is double that amount.\n\nSo, if I were to distribute the people such that some houses have more than 2 people, but still keeping the smallest house at 2 people, I need to see if that's possible.\n\nLet's assume the smallest house has 2 people. Then the remaining 24 houses need to account for 100 - 2 = 98 people. If each of these 24 houses has at least 2 people, their minimum total would be 24 * 2 = 48 people. That leaves 98 - 48 = 50 people to be distributed among these 24 houses.\n\nNow, since each house must have an even number of people, the additional people must be added in increments of 2. So, for example, a house with 2 people can have 2 more people to make it 4, and so on.\n\nSo, the 24 houses already have 48 people, and we need to add 50 more people in increments of 2 per house. But 50 is an even number, and 24 houses can share these 50 people if we distribute them appropriately.\n\nWait a minute, but 50 divided by 2 is 25, which is more than the number of houses available (24). That suggests that not all additional people can be distributed evenly if each house can only take multiples of 2.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the smallest house isn't necessarily 2 people. Maybe it's higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem. Let's consider that the sum of even numbers is even, which it is (100), and we have 25 houses.\n\nLet me denote the number of people in each house as 2n, where n is a positive integer. So, the total number of people is the sum from i=1 to 25 of 2n_i, which equals 100.\n\nThis simplifies to 2*(sum of n_i) = 100, so the sum of n_i is 50.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal value of n_i, given that all n_i are positive integers.\n\nThe minimal value of n_i is 1, which corresponds to 2 people in the house.\n\nIf one house has n_i=1 (2 people), and the remaining 24 houses have n_i >=1, their sum is 50.\n\nSo, the sum of the remaining 24 houses is 50 -1 =49.\n\nSince each of these 24 houses has at least n_i=1, their total is at least 24*1=24.\n\nThat leaves 49 -24 =25 to be distributed among the 24 houses.\n\nBut since each house can have n_i >=1, and the remaining 25 can be distributed in increments of 1 to these houses.\n\nWait, but n_i has to be integers, and we're dealing with even numbers, so everything checks out.\n\nBut the question is about the smallest house, which in this case is 2 people.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a constraint that prevents this.\n\nLet me consider if all houses have at least 2 people, so n_i >=1.\n\nWait, no, if n_i >=1, then the minimal is indeed 2 people.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to minimize the smallest house.\n\nWait, maybe the smallest house can have more than 2 people, but that wouldn't make sense because we're trying to find the smallest possible number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint based on the number of houses.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we try to minimize the smallest house, which would mean making as many houses as possible have the minimal number, and then distributing the remaining people accordingly.\n\nSo, if the smallest house has 2 people, then the rest must account for 98 people in 24 houses, with each house having at least 2 people.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, if each of the remaining houses has at least 2 people, that's 48 people, leaving 50 people to be distributed in increments of 2.\n\nBut 50 divided by 2 is 25, which is more than the number of houses (24), so at least one house will have to take more than 2 additional people.\n\nWait, but actually, since we can distribute the additional people in increments of 2, we can have some houses with more people.\n\nFor example, some houses could have 2 + 2k people, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, to distribute 50 additional people in increments of 2 among 24 houses, some houses will have more people.\n\nSpecifically, 24 houses can take up to 24*2=48 additional people, but we have 50 to distribute, which is 2 more.\n\nSo, one house will have to take an extra 2 people, meaning that one house will have 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 people, or perhaps distributed differently.\n\nBut the point is, it's possible to distribute the people in this way.\n\nTherefore, the smallest house can have 2 people.\n\nBut perhaps there's a constraint that prevents this.\n\nLet me consider if there's a minimum number of people per house beyond 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a unique solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the average number of people per house.\n\nTotal people is 100, number of houses is 25, so average is 4 people per house.\n\nGiven that each house has an even number, possible values are 2,4,6,8,...\n\nSo, if the average is 4, perhaps most houses have 4 people, and some have more or less.\n\nLet me assume that the smallest house has 2 people.\n\nThen, the remaining 24 houses must have a total of 98 people.\n\nIf all 24 houses have 4 people, that's 96 people, which is less than 98.\n\nSo, one house needs to have 6 people to make up the difference.\n\n96 + 6 = 102, which is too much.\n\nWait, 24 houses with 4 people is 96, and one house with 6 people would make it 102, which is more than 100.\n\nThat doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if 23 houses have 4 people, that's 92 people, and one house has 8 people, making 100.\n\nBut in this case, the smallest house is still 2 people.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the smallest house is 2 people, and the others are mostly 4, with one house being 8.\n\nBut is this the only possible distribution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other distributions where the smallest house has more than 2 people.\n\nFor example, suppose the smallest house has 4 people.\n\nThen, the remaining 24 houses must have a total of 96 people.\n\nIf each of these 24 houses has at least 4 people, that's 96 people exactly.\n\nSo, it's possible for all houses to have exactly 4 people, making the smallest house 4 people.\n\nAlternatively, some houses could have more than 4, but the smallest would still be 4.\n\nSimilarly, if the smallest house has 6 people, then the remaining 24 houses must have 94 people, which, with each having at least 6 people, would total 144 people, which is more than 100.\n\nThat doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if the smallest house has 4 people, and the remaining houses have at least 4 people, totaling 96 people, that's possible.\n\nSo, in this case, the smallest house can have 4 people.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of a scenario where the smallest house has 2 people.\n\nBut if the smallest house has 2 people, and the remaining houses have a total of 98 people, which must be distributed in even numbers.\n\nBut in that case, it's possible, as I saw earlier.\n\nSo, is there a way to determine which is the actual smallest house?\n\nMaybe I need to consider that there might be multiple houses with the smallest number of people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a unique solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the number of houses on each side of the street.\n\nThere are 10 houses on one side and 15 on the other.\n\nMaybe there's a constraint based on the distribution between the two sides.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify any difference between the two sides, so perhaps it's irrelevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of people on each side must be integer values, but that's already implied.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of people in the 10 houses on one side as a1, a2, ..., a10, and the 15 houses on the other side as b1, b2, ..., b15.\n\nAll ai and bi are even positive integers.\n\nThe sum of all ai and bi is 100.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value among all ai and bi.\n\nLet\u2019s denote m as the minimal number of people in any house.\n\nSo, m is the smallest among all ai and bi.\n\nWe need to find the possible values of m.\n\nSince all ai and bi are even and positive, m can be 2,4,6,...\n\nLet\u2019s assume m=2.\n\nThen, one or more houses have 2 people.\n\nThe remaining houses must account for 100 - m = 98 people.\n\nIf one house has 2 people, and the remaining 24 houses have at least 2 people each, their minimum total is 24*2=48 people.\n\nThen, the remaining 98 - 48=50 people must be distributed among the 24 houses in increments of 2.\n\nSince 50 is even, this is possible.\n\nFor example, give 2 additional people to 25 houses, but we only have 24 houses, so this is not directly possible.\n\nWait, but since each house can take multiple increments of 2, we can distribute the 50 people by giving some houses more than the minimum.\n\nSpecifically, 24 houses can take up to 24*2=48 additional people, but we have 50 to distribute.\n\nSo, one house will have to take an extra 2 people, making it 6 people in that house.\n\nFor example, 23 houses have 2 people, one house has 6 people, and the rest have 2 people.\n\nBut in this case, the smallest house still has 2 people.\n\nAlternatively, if we have more houses with more people, the smallest can still be 2.\n\nSo, m=2 is possible.\n\nNow, what if m=4?\n\nIn this case, all houses have at least 4 people.\n\nThe total minimum is 25*4=100 people.\n\nSince the total is exactly 100, all houses must have exactly 4 people.\n\nIn this case, the smallest house has 4 people.\n\nThis is also a possible scenario.\n\nSimilarly, if m=6, then the minimum total is 25*6=150 people, which is more than 100, so this is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for m are 2 and 4.\n\nNow, to find the smallest possible number of people in the smallest house, it would be m=2.\n\nHowever, the problem might be expecting m=4, but that seems too high.\n\nWait, but m=2 is possible, as shown earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint based on the number of houses on each side.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSuppose the 10 houses on one side have a certain number of people, and the 15 on the other side have another number.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any difference between the two sides, so perhaps it's irrelevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a constraint on the number of people per side.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that m can be 2 or 4, and m=2 is possible, then the smallest house has 2 people.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a trick here.\n\nMaybe the problem is implying that the smallest house cannot have 2 people due to some constraint.\n\nBut based on my reasoning, it seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the distribution again.\n\nIf one house has 2 people, and the remaining 24 houses have at least 2 people, their minimum total is 48 people, leaving 50 people to be distributed in increments of 2.\n\nBut 24 houses can take up to 24*2=48 additional people, but we have 50 to distribute.\n\nSo, one house needs to take an extra 2 people, making it 6 people in that house.\n\nTherefore, it's possible.\n\nHence, the smallest house can have 2 people.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
