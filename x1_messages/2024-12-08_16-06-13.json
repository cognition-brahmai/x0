        "content": "Let's see. So, we have a train that's traveling at a constant speed of 60 km/h and it takes 30 minutes to reach its destination. Now, the question is, if it had traveled at a constant speed of 80 km/h instead, how long would it have taken to reach the same destination?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between speed, time, and distance. I recall that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, if the train is going at 60 km/h for 30 minutes, I can find out the distance it covers.\n\nBut wait, time is in minutes, and speed is in kilometers per hour. I need to make sure the units match. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, time in hours is 0.5 hours.\n\nNow, distance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 km/h \u00d7 0.5 h = 30 km.\n\nSo, the destination is 30 kilometers away.\n\nNow, if the train travels at 80 km/h instead, I need to find out how long it would take to cover the same 30 km.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 30 km / 80 km/h.\n\nLet me calculate that: 30 divided by 80 is 0.375 hours.\n\nBut the question is asking for time in minutes, I think. So, I need to convert 0.375 hours into minutes.\n\nSince 1 hour is 60 minutes, 0.375 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 22.5 minutes.\n\nSo, at 80 km/h, it would take 22.5 minutes to reach the destination.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf the train is going faster, it should take less time, which it does: 22.5 minutes is less than 30 minutes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nWe already know the distance is 30 km, and the new speed is 80 km/h.\n\nSo, time = 30 / 80 = 0.375 hours, which is 22.5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the ratio of speeds to find the ratio of times.\n\nThe speeds are 60 km/h and 80 km/h.\n\nThe ratio of speeds is 60:80, which simplifies to 3:4.\n\nSince speed and time are inversely proportional (assuming distance is constant), the ratio of times should be 4:3.\n\nSo, if at 60 km/h it takes 30 minutes, then at 80 km/h it should take (30 minutes \u00d7 3)/4 = 22.5 minutes.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula: time2 = (speed1 / speed2) \u00d7 time1.\n\nBut actually, since time is inversely proportional to speed, it should be time2 = (speed1 / speed2) \u00d7 time1.\n\nWait, no: time2 = (speed1 / speed2) \u00d7 time1.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf speed increases, time decreases, so it should be time2 = (speed1 / speed2) \u00d7 time1.\n\nLet's plug in the numbers: time2 = (60 / 80) \u00d7 30 = (0.75) \u00d7 30 = 22.5 minutes.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula: time2 = time1 \u00d7 (speed1 / speed2).\n\nWait, that's the same as above.\n\nSo, in any case, the time taken at 80 km/h is 22.5 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22.5 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
