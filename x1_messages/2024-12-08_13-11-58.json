        "content": "So I've got this problem here: find the area of a triangle with sides of length 5, 12, and 13. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember there's a formula for finding the area of a triangle when you know all three sides, but I can't recall it off the top of my head. Maybe it's Heron's formula? I think that's the one.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm if these sides actually form a valid triangle. I know that for any triangle, the sum of any two sides has to be greater than the third side. Let's check that.\n\n5 + 12 = 17, which is greater than 13.\n\n5 + 13 = 18, which is greater than 12.\n\n12 + 13 = 25, which is greater than 5.\n\nLooks good, so it is a valid triangle.\n\nNow, Heron's formula says that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is:\n\nArea = \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)],\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, for this triangle, a = 5, b = 12, c = 13.\n\nLet's calculate s:\n\ns = (5 + 12 + 13)/2 = 30/2 = 15.\n\nNow, plug these values into Heron's formula:\n\nArea = \u221a[15(15 - 5)(15 - 12)(15 - 13)] = \u221a[15 * 10 * 3 * 2] = \u221a[15 * 10 * 3 * 2] = \u221a[450 * 2] = \u221a900 = 30.\n\nSo, the area is 30 square units.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit straightforward. Maybe there's another way to find the area. Maybe I can check if this is a right-angled triangle, since 5, 12, 13 is a Pythagorean triple.\n\nLet's see: does 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 13\u00b2?\n\n5\u00b2 = 25\n\n12\u00b2 = 144\n\n25 + 144 = 169\n\n13\u00b2 = 169\n\nYes, it is a right-angled triangle with legs 5 and 12, and hypotenuse 13.\n\nIf it's a right-angled triangle, the area can also be calculated as (1/2) * base * height.\n\nSo, area = (1/2) * 5 * 12 = (1/2) * 60 = 30.\n\nThat matches the result I got from Heron's formula. Good, that makes sense.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to find the area of this triangle. Maybe using trigonometry, but I don't have any angle measures here. Or maybe using coordinates, but I don't have coordinates provided.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a right-angled triangle, I could also think about the altitude to the hypotenuse, but that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nI think Heron's formula and the right-triangle area formula are sufficient here. Both methods confirm that the area is 30 square units.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check the calculations.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = 15\n\ns - a = 15 - 5 = 10\n\ns - b = 15 - 12 = 3\n\ns - c = 15 - 13 = 2\n\nSo, area = \u221a[15 * 10 * 3 * 2] = \u221a[15 * 10 * 6] = \u221a[15 * 60] = \u221a900 = 30.\n\nAnd using the right-triangle area formula:\n\n(1/2) * 5 * 12 = 30.\n\nBoth methods agree, so I'm confident the answer is 30.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other type of triangle with these side lengths, but since the Pythagorean theorem holds, it's definitively a right-angled triangle.\n\nAlright, that's it. The area of the triangle is 30 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
