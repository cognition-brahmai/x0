        "content": "So, I've got this probability question here. A man has two children, and I meet one of them, who's a boy. I need to find out the probability that the other child is also a boy. Hmm, probability can be tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider all possible scenarios for the genders of the two children. Since each child can be either a boy or a girl, there are four possible combinations:\n\n1. Boy-Boy (BB)\n\n2. Boy-Girl (BG)\n\n3. Girl-Boy (GB)\n\n4. Girl-Girl (GG)\n\nWait, but I know that one of the children is a boy, because I met him. So, that means the GG combination is impossible. Now, I'm left with BB, BG, and GB.\n\nOkay, so initially, without any additional information, if one child is a boy, the probability that the other is also a boy would be 1 out of these 3 remaining possibilities, which is 1/3. But, I think there might be more to this because I met one of the children, and it's a boy.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the man has two children, and I meet one at random, and it's a boy. What's the probability that the other child is also a boy?\n\nWell, in the BB case, if I meet one child at random, there's a 50% chance I'll meet either boy. In the BG or GB cases, there's only one boy, so there's a 50% chance I'll meet the boy in BG and 50% in GB.\n\nWait, maybe I should use conditional probability here. Let's define:\n\n- Event A: The other child is a boy (i.e., both are boys).\n\n- Event B: I meet a boy.\n\nI need to find P(A|B), the probability that both are boys given that I met a boy.\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nFirst, P(A and B): This is the probability that both children are boys and I meet one boy. If both are boys, and I meet one at random, the probability of meeting a boy is 1 (since both are boys). So, P(A and B) = P(A) = (1/4) because there are four equally likely combinations: BB, BG, GB, GG. But GG is excluded since I know one is a boy, so actually, P(A) should be reconsidered.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the reduced sample space where one child is a boy. So, possible scenarios are BB, BG, GB.\n\nIn this case, P(A) = P(BB) = 1/3.\n\nNow, P(B): the probability that I meet a boy.\n\nIn BB, there are two boys, so the probability of meeting a boy is 1.\n\nIn BG, there's one boy and one girl, so the probability of meeting a boy is 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, in GB, it's also 1/2.\n\nSo, total P(B) = P(BB) * P(meet boy|BB) + P(BG) * P(meet boy|BG) + P(GB) * P(meet boy|GB)\n\n= (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(1/2) + (1/3)*(1/2)\n\n= (1/3) + (1/6) + (1/6) = (1/3) + (1/3) = 2/3\n\nNow, P(A and B) = P(BB) * P(meet boy|BB) = (1/3)*1 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, P(A|B) = (1/3) / (2/3) = 1/2\n\nWait, that can't be right. Earlier, I thought it was 1/3, but according to this calculation, it's 1/2.\n\nBut I remember from probability classes that in some similar problems, the answer is 1/3, and in others, it's 1/2. Maybe it depends on how the information is presented.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Suppose the man has two children, and I know that at least one is a boy. What's the probability that both are boys? In this case, it's 1/3, as there are three possibilities: BB, BG, GB.\n\nBut in this scenario, I meet one child, and it's a boy. Is that the same as knowing at least one is a boy?\n\nI think there's a difference. When I meet one child and it's a boy, it's more specific than just knowing that at least one is a boy.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of conditional probability again.\n\nLet me denote the child I met as Child 1 or Child 2.\n\nSuppose Child 1 is the one I met, and it's a boy.\n\nThen, the probability that Child 2 is also a boy is what I need.\n\nGiven that Child 1 is a boy, the possible combinations are BB and BG.\n\nSo, in this case, P(BB|Child1=Boy) = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, if Child 2 is the one I met, and it's a boy, then the possible combinations are BB and GB, and P(BB|Child2=Boy)=1/2.\n\nWait, but I don't know which child I met. So, maybe I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nLet me consider that I meet one child at random, and it turns out to be a boy.\n\nThen, the probability that the other child is also a boy.\n\nSo, back to the earlier calculation.\n\nTotal probability P(B) = probability of meeting a boy.\n\nP(B) = P(BB) * P(meet boy|BB) + P(BG) * P(meet boy|BG) + P(GB) * P(meet boy|GB)\n\n= (1/4)*1 + (1/4)*(1/2) + (1/4)*(1/2) = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/2\n\nWait, earlier I had P(B)=2/3, but now it's 1/2. Confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to be consistent in the probabilities assigned to each scenario.\n\nInitially, without any information, the four combinations are equally likely: BB, BG, GB, GG, each with probability 1/4.\n\nBut given that I meet one child who is a boy, the GG combination is impossible.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are BB, BG, GB.\n\nBut are these three equally likely?\n\nWell, in the BB case, there are two boys, so effectively, the probability of BB should be higher since there are two ways to meet a boy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of counting individuals.\n\nSuppose there are many families with two children. In half of them, the first child is a boy, and in half, the first child is a girl. Similarly for the second child.\n\nBut let's consider that I meet one child at random from these families, and that child is a boy.\n\nWhat's the probability that the other child is also a boy?\n\nMaybe it's easier to think in terms of counting.\n\nSuppose there are 4 families, each with two children:\n\n1. BB\n\n2. BG\n\n3. GB\n\n4. GG\n\nBut GG is excluded because I know one child is a boy.\n\nSo, we have 3 families: BB, BG, GB.\n\nNow, in BB, there are two boys who I could meet.\n\nIn BG and GB, there is one boy each.\n\nSo, total number of boys I could meet: 2 (from BB) + 1 (from BG) + 1 (from GB) = 4 boys.\n\nOut of these 4 boys, 2 are from the BB family.\n\nTherefore, if I meet one boy, the probability that he is from the BB family is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nHence, the probability that the other child is also a boy is 1/2.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 1/3. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check another way.\n\nAssume that I meet one child, and it's a boy.\n\nI need to find the probability that the other child is also a boy.\n\nGiven that, in the BB family, there are two boys, so the probability that the other child is a boy is 1.\n\nIn BG or GB families, there is only one boy, so the probability that the other child is a boy is 0.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n(P(BB) * 1) + (P(BG) * 0) + (P(GB) * 0) = P(BB)\n\nBut earlier, I calculated P(BB) = 1/3, which would give 1/3, but according to the previous calculation, it's 1/2.\n\nI'm getting conflicting answers here. Maybe I need to consider the correct sample space.\n\nPerhaps the error is in assuming that BB, BG, and GB are equally likely after excluding GG.\n\nInitially, all four combinations are equally likely: BB, BG, GB, GG.\n\nBut given that one child is a boy, GG is excluded.\n\nSo, the probability of BB is 1/3, BG is 1/3, and GB is 1/3.\n\nBut when I meet one child who is a boy, it's twice as likely to come from BB than from BG or GB, because BB has two boys.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use Bayes' theorem here.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- H1: BB\n\n- H2: BG\n\n- H3: GB\n\nWe know P(H1) = P(H2) = P(H3) = 1/3.\n\nEvidence E: I meet a boy.\n\nP(E|H1) = 1 (since both are boys)\n\nP(E|H2) = 1/2 (only one boy)\n\nP(E|H3) = 1/2 (only one boy)\n\nNow, P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2) + P(E|H3) * P(H3)]\n\n= (1 * 1/3) / [1 * 1/3 + 1/2 * 1/3 + 1/2 * 1/3]\n\n= (1/3) / [1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6] = (1/3) / (2/3) = 1/2\n\nSo, according to Bayes' theorem, the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut I recall that in some probability textbooks, similar problems have the answer as 1/3.\n\nMaybe the difference lies in how the information is presented.\n\nIs there a difference between \"one child is a boy\" and \"I meet one child who is a boy\"?\n\nIn the first case, where \"one child is a boy,\" the answer is 1/3.\n\nIn the second case, where I meet one child who is a boy, the answer is 1/2.\n\nPerhaps the act of meeting the child and knowing it's a boy provides different information than just knowing that one child is a boy.\n\nThis seems to align with the distinction in the Monte Hall problem, where additional information affects the probabilities.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, where I meet one child who is a boy, the probability that the other child is also a boy is 1/2.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}"
