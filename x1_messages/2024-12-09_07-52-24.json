        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that a tree doubles its height every year, and after 5 years, it's 32 feet tall. We need to find out how tall it was after 2 years.\n\nFirst, since the tree doubles its height every year, that means its height each year is multiplied by 2 compared to the previous year. So, if we go backwards, we can find out the height in previous years by dividing by 2.\n\nLet's start from year 5, when the tree is 32 feet tall.\n\nIn year 4, the tree would have been half of that, because it doubled to reach 32 feet in year 5.\n\nSo, year 4: 32 / 2 = 16 feet.\n\nSimilarly, in year 3: 16 / 2 = 8 feet.\n\nYear 2: 8 / 2 = 4 feet.\n\nYear 1: 4 / 2 = 2 feet.\n\nYear 0 (the starting point): 2 / 2 = 1 foot.\n\nWait, but the question is only asking for the height after 2 years, which according to this, is 4 feet.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the growth pattern. If the tree doubles its height every year, then its height can be represented as:\n\nHeight = initial height * 2^(number of years)\n\nGiven that after 5 years, the height is 32 feet, we can set up the equation:\n\n32 = initial height * 2^5\n\nSince 2^5 = 32, then initial height = 32 / 32 = 1 foot.\n\nSo, the tree was 1 foot tall at the start (year 0).\n\nThen, after 1 year: 1 * 2 = 2 feet.\n\nAfter 2 years: 2 * 2 = 4 feet.\n\nAfter 3 years: 4 * 2 = 8 feet.\n\nAfter 4 years: 8 * 2 = 16 feet.\n\nAfter 5 years: 16 * 2 = 32 feet.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, after 2 years, the tree was 4 feet tall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
