Below is a Python function that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Track if any swaps are made in this pass\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        # If no two elements were swapped in the inner loop, the list is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\n# sorted_list = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])\n# print(sorted_list)\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as input and sorts it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The optimization with the `swapped` flag helps to reduce the number of passes if the list becomes sorted before completing all the iterations."
