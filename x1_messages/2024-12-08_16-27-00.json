It says that the cube has a volume of 27 cubic meters, and I need to find out two things: the length of one side of the cube and the total surface area of the cube. Okay, let's start with the volume.\n\nI remember that the volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the length of one side. So, if the length of one side is 's', then the volume 'v' is s cubed, or v = s\u00b3. In this case, the volume is 27 cubic meters, so I can set up the equation like this:\n\ns\u00b3 = 27\n\nNow, to find 's', I need to take the cube root of both sides of the equation. The cube root of 27 is 3, because 3 times 3 times 3 equals 27. So, s = 3 meters. That's the length of one side of the cube.\n\nNext, I need to find the total surface area of the cube. I know that a cube has six faces, and each face is a square with sides of length 's'. So, the area of one face is s squared, or s\u00b2. Since there are six faces, the total surface area 'a' is 6 times s\u00b2, or a = 6s\u00b2.\n\nI already know that s = 3 meters, so I can plug that into the formula:\n\na = 6 * (3)\u00b2\n\nFirst, I square 3, which is 9, and then multiply by 6:\n\na = 6 * 9 = 54\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cube is 54 square meters.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. The volume is 27 cubic meters, and the cube root of 27 is indeed 3 meters, so that seems correct. Then, each face has an area of 3 meters times 3 meters, which is 9 square meters, and with six faces, that's 54 square meters. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the answer: the length of one side is 3 meters, and the total surface area is 54 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe length of one side of the cube is \\boxed{3 \\text{ meters}}, and the total surface area of the cube is \\boxed{54 \\text{ square meters}}."
