        "content": "So I have this problem here: I need to evaluate the line integral of the vector field F(x,y) = <y\u00b2, x\u00b2> around the unit circle centered at the origin, and I'm supposed to use Green's theorem to do it. Okay, let's recall what Green's theorem is. It's a way to convert a line integral around a closed curve into a double integral over the region inside that curve. The formula is:\n\n\u222eC (P dx + Q dy) = \u222cD ( \u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y ) dA\n\nwhere C is the positive oriented boundary of the region D, and P and Q have continuous partial derivatives in an open region containing D.\n\nSo, in this case, my vector field is F = <y\u00b2, x\u00b2>, which means P = y\u00b2 and Q = x\u00b2. I need to find the partial derivatives \u2202Q/\u2202x and \u2202P/\u2202y.\n\nLet's compute those:\n\n\u2202Q/\u2202x = \u2202(x\u00b2)/\u2202x = 2x\n\n\u2202P/\u2202y = \u2202(y\u00b2)/\u2202y = 2y\n\nSo, the integrand for the double integral becomes \u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y = 2x - 2y = 2(x - y).\n\nNow, I need to set up the double integral of 2(x - y) over the unit disk D, which is the region inside the unit circle centered at the origin.\n\nSo, \u222cD 2(x - y) dA\n\nHmm, integrating 2(x - y) over the unit disk. I wonder if there's some symmetry here that can make this easier. Let's think about the region D. It's symmetric with respect to both x and y axes.\n\nConsider integrating x over D: since D is symmetric about the y-axis, the integral of x over D should be zero, because the positive and negative parts cancel each other out.\n\nSimilarly, integrating y over D: since D is symmetric about the x-axis, the integral of y over D should also be zero.\n\nSo, \u222cD x dA = 0 and \u222cD y dA = 0\n\nTherefore, \u222cD 2(x - y) dA = 2 \u222cD x dA - 2 \u222cD y dA = 2*0 - 2*0 = 0\n\nWait, that seems too easy. Is there a mistake here?\n\nLet me double-check. Green's theorem says \u222eC P dx + Q dy = \u222cD (\u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y) dA\n\nI have \u222cD (2x - 2y) dA\n\nGiven that D is the unit disk, which is symmetric with respect to both axes, and since x and y are odd functions with respect to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, their integrals over D should indeed be zero.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should set up the integral in polar coordinates and compute it directly.\n\nIn polar coordinates, x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8, and dA = r dr d\u03b8\n\nThe unit disk D can be described by 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0\n\nSo, \u222cD 2(x - y) dA = \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] \u222b[0 to 1] 2(r cos\u03b8 - r sin\u03b8) r dr d\u03b8\n\n= \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] \u222b[0 to 1] 2r\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8) dr d\u03b8\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to r:\n\n\u222b[0 to 1] 2r\u00b2 dr = (2/3)r\u00b3 | from 0 to 1 = 2/3\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n(2/3) \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] (cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8) d\u03b8\n\nNow, integrate with respect to \u03b8:\n\n\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] cos\u03b8 d\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 | from 0 to 2\u03c0 = 0\n\n\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 = -cos\u03b8 | from 0 to 2\u03c0 = 0\n\nSo, (2/3)(0 - 0) = 0\n\nAlright, so confirms my earlier conclusion that the double integral is zero.\n\nBut wait a second, is Green's theorem applicable here? Let's check the conditions.\n\nGreen's theorem requires that P and Q have continuous partial derivatives in an open region containing D. Here, P = y\u00b2 and Q = x\u00b2, and their partial derivatives are \u2202P/\u2202x = 0, \u2202P/\u2202y = 2y, \u2202Q/\u2202x = 2x, \u2202Q/\u2202y = 0, which are all continuous everywhere. So, yes, Green's theorem applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the line integral directly to verify.\n\nLet's parametrize the unit circle C. A standard parametrization is:\n\nx = cos t\n\ny = sin t\n\nwhere t goes from 0 to 2\u03c0\n\nThen, dx/dt = -sin t\n\ndy/dt = cos t\n\nSo, dr = <dx/dt, dy/dt> dt = <-sin t, cos t> dt\n\nThe vector field F(x,y) = <y\u00b2, x\u00b2> becomes F(cos t, sin t) = <sin\u00b2 t, cos\u00b2 t>\n\nTherefore, F\u00b7dr = <sin\u00b2 t, cos\u00b2 t> \u00b7 <-sin t, cos t> dt = -sin\u00b3 t + cos\u00b3 t dt\n\nSo, the line integral is:\n\n\u222eC F\u00b7dr = \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] (-sin\u00b3 t + cos\u00b3 t) dt\n\nLet's compute this integral.\n\nFirst, split it into two parts:\n\n\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] -sin\u00b3 t dt + \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] cos\u00b3 t dt\n\nConsider \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] -sin\u00b3 t dt = -\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] sin\u00b3 t dt\n\nand \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] cos\u00b3 t dt\n\nWe can use the identities:\n\nsin\u00b3 t = (3 sin t - sin 3t)/4\n\ncos\u00b3 t = (3 cos t + cos 3t)/4\n\nSo,\n\n-\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] sin\u00b3 t dt = -\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] (3 sin t - sin 3t)/4 dt = -(3/4) \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] sin t dt + (1/4) \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] sin 3t dt\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] cos\u00b3 t dt = \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] (3 cos t + cos 3t)/4 dt = (3/4) \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] cos t dt + (1/4) \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] cos 3t dt\n\nNow, \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] sin t dt = 0\n\n\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] sin 3t dt = 0\n\n\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] cos t dt = 0\n\n\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] cos 3t dt = 0\n\nTherefore, both integrals are zero, so the line integral is zero.\n\nThis matches the result I got using Green's theorem.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to note that the vector field F = <y\u00b2, x\u00b2> is not conservative, since \u2202P/\u2202y = 2y and \u2202Q/\u2202x = 2x, and 2y \u2260 2x in general. However, the circulation around the closed curve C happens to be zero in this case.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the line integral \u222eC F\u00b7dr = 0\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
