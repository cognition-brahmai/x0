        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out the profit for each type of product and then sum them up to get the total profit.\n\nStarting with Product A:\n\n- Sold 300 units at $20 each.\n\n- Profit margin is 25%.\n\nFirst, calculate the total revenue from Product A:\n\nRevenue_A = number of units * price per unit = 300 * 20 = $6000.\n\nNow, the profit margin is 25%, which means that 25% of the revenue is profit.\n\nSo, Profit_A = Revenue_A * profit margin = 6000 * 0.25 = $1500.\n\nNext, Product B:\n\n- Sold 200 units at $30 each.\n\n- Profit margin is 40%.\n\nAgain, calculate the total revenue from Product B:\n\nRevenue_B = number of units * price per unit = 200 * 30 = $6000.\n\nProfit margin is 40%, so:\n\nProfit_B = Revenue_B * profit margin = 6000 * 0.40 = $2400.\n\nNow, to find the total profit, add Profit_A and Profit_B:\n\nTotal_Profit = Profit_A + Profit_B = 1500 + 2400 = $3900.\n\nSo, the total profit made from these sales is $3900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3900} \\]"
