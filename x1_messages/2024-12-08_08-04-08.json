Hmm, so how many children does the mother have in total?\n\nWell, starting with the mother having three daughters, that's three children. But then it says each daughter has one brother. So, does that mean there's one brother shared among the three daughters, or does each daughter have her own brother?\n\nWait, if each daughter has one brother, it probably means they share the same brother, right? Because if each had her own brother, that would mean there are three brothers, one for each daughter.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because brothers are shared among sisters. So, in a family, if there are sisters, they all share the same brothers.\n\nSo, if each daughter has one brother, that means there is one brother shared among the three daughters.\n\nTherefore, total children would be three daughters plus one brother, which is four children.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the mother has three daughters and one son, then each daughter has one brother, who is the son.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the mother has four children in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
