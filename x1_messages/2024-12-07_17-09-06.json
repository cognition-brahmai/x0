        "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that! Let's assume we have the following table structures for our bookstore database:\n\n1. **Books** table:\n   - BookID (Primary Key)\n   - Title\n   - AuthorID (Foreign Key referencing Authors)\n   - PublisherID (Foreign Key referencing Publishers)\n   - Price\n   - PublicationDate\n\n2. **Authors** table:\n   - AuthorID (Primary Key)\n   - Name\n   - Biography\n\n3. **Publishers** table:\n   - PublisherID (Primary Key)\n   - Name\n   - Address\n   - Phone\n\nNow, let's tackle each query one by one.\n\n### 1. Finding all books by a specific author\n\nTo find all books written by a specific author, you can use a SQL query that joins the Books and Authors tables based on the AuthorID. Here's an example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT B.Title, B.Price, B.PublicationDate\nFROM Books B\nJOIN Authors A ON B.AuthorID = A.AuthorID\nWHERE A.Name = 'Specific Author Name';\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- We select the Title, Price, and PublicationDate from the Books table.\n- We join the Authors table on the AuthorID to get the author's name.\n- We filter the results where the author's name matches the specific name you're looking for.\n\n### 2. Updating the price of a book\n\nTo update the price of a specific book, you can use the UPDATE statement. Here's an example:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE Books\nSET Price = 29.99\nWHERE Title = 'Book Title' AND AuthorID = (SELECT AuthorID FROM Authors WHERE Name = 'Author Name');\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- We set the new price for the book.\n- We specify the book by its title and author to ensure we're updating the correct record.\n\nAlternatively, if you have the BookID, it's more efficient:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE Books\nSET Price = 29.99\nWHERE BookID = 123;\n```\n\n### 3. Deleting a publisher and all their books\n\nTo delete a publisher and all their associated books, you need to first delete the books associated with that publisher and then delete the publisher itself. This is because there might be foreign key constraints.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```sql\n-- Delete all books from the publisher\nDELETE FROM Books\nWHERE PublisherID = (SELECT PublisherID FROM Publishers WHERE Name = 'Publisher Name');\n\n-- Delete the publisher\nDELETE FROM Publishers\nWHERE Name = 'Publisher Name';\n```\n\nMake sure to replace 'Publisher Name' with the actual name of the publisher you want to delete.\n\n### 4. Adding a new book to the database\n\nTo add a new book to the database, you can use the INSERT INTO statement. Here's an example:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Books (Title, AuthorID, PublisherID, Price, PublicationDate)\nVALUES ('New Book Title', \n        (SELECT AuthorID FROM Authors WHERE Name = 'Author Name'), \n        (SELECT PublisherID FROM Publishers WHERE Name = 'Publisher Name'), \n        19.99, \n        '2023-10-01');\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- We specify the columns to insert data into.\n- We use subqueries to get the AuthorID and PublisherID based on their names.\n- We provide the values for Title, AuthorID, PublisherID, Price, and PublicationDate.\n\nAlternatively, if you have the AuthorID and PublisherID, you can directly insert them:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Books (Title, AuthorID, PublisherID, Price, PublicationDate)\nVALUES ('New Book Title', 456, 789, 19.99, '2023-10-01');\n```\n\nThese queries should help you manage your bookstore database effectively.
