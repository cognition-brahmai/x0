        "content": "So I have this problem here: I've got a 20% off coupon for an item that costs $75 originally. I need to figure out how much I'll pay after applying the discount. Hmm, I think I know how to do this, but let me talk through it step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Percentages can sometimes confuse me, but I think of percent as \"per hundred.\" So, 20% means 20 per 100, which is the same as 20/100 or 0.20 in decimal form. That makes sense.\n\nNow, to find out how much discount I'm getting, I need to calculate 20% of $75. So, I multiply 75 by 0.20. Let me do that:\n\n75 \u00d7 0.20 = ?\n\nWell, 75 times 20 is 1500, and since 0.20 has two decimal places, the result should have two decimal places as well. But 1500 with two decimal places is 15.00. So, the discount amount is $15.\n\nNow, to find out the final price I have to pay, I subtract the discount from the original price:\n\n75 - 15 = 60\n\nSo, I think I'll pay $60 after applying the 20% discount.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. I've heard of methods where you calculate the remaining percentage you have to pay after the discount.\n\nIf the discount is 20%, that means I'm paying 80% of the original price, right? Because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, if I calculate 80% of $75, that should give me the same result.\n\nFirst, convert 80% to decimal form: 80/100 = 0.80.\n\nNow, multiply 75 by 0.80:\n\n75 \u00d7 0.80 = ?\n\n75 times 80 is 6000, and with two decimal places, it's 60.00.\n\nSo, again, I get $60.\n\nAlright, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like I'll pay $60 for the item after applying the 20% discount.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check this with another method. Let's see.\n\nSuppose I use fractions instead of decimals. 20% is the same as 20/100, which simplifies to 1/5.\n\nSo, the discount is 1/5 of $75.\n\nTo find 1/5 of 75, I divide 75 by 5:\n\n75 \u00f7 5 = 15\n\nSo, the discount is $15, and subtracting that from the original price: 75 - 15 = 60.\n\nAgain, $60.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of percentages, I can set up a proportion.\n\n20% of 75 is equal to x.\n\nSo, 20/100 = x/75\n\nThen, cross-multiplying: 20 \u00d7 75 = 100 \u00d7 x\n\n1500 = 100x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 100: x = 15\n\nSo, the discount is $15, and the final price is 75 - 15 = 60.\n\nOnce more, $60.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. I'm confident that $60 is the correct amount I'll pay after applying the 20% discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
