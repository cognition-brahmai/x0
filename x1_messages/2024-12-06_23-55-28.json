        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 12 balls in total, and some of them are black and some are white. The probability of picking a black ball at random is 1/3, and I need to find out how many black balls are in the box.\n\nOkay, probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a black ball, and the total outcomes are picking any ball from the box.\n\nSo, the formula for probability here is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability of black ball} = \\frac{\\text{Number of black balls}}{\\text{Total number of balls}} \\]\n\nI know the total number of balls is 12, and the probability is 1/3. So, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{\\text{Number of black balls}}{12} \\]\n\nNow, I need to find the number of black balls. Let's call that number B. So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{B}{12} \\]\n\nTo find B, I can cross-multiply:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 12 = 3 \\times B \\]\n\n\\[ 12 = 3B \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{12}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ B = 4 \\]\n\nSo, there are 4 black balls in the box.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 4 black balls out of 12, the probability of picking a black ball would indeed be 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3. That makes sense.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, if there are 4 black balls, then the number of white balls would be 12 - 4 = 8. So, the probability of picking a white ball would be 8/12, which is 2/3. And since there are only black and white balls, the probabilities should add up to 1.\n\nLet's check: 1/3 (black) + 2/3 (white) = 1. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, my final answer is that there are 4 black balls in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
