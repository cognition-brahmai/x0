        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression given is ((3^2 - 4) * 6) / (12 / 4). Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nStarting inside the parentheses, I see 3^2 - 4. Exponents come before subtraction, so 3^2 is 9. Then, 9 minus 4 is 5. So, the first part inside the parentheses is 5.\n\nNow, the expression is (5 * 6) / (12 / 4).\n\nNext, I see multiplication and division. According to PEMDAS, I should handle these from left to right.\n\nSo, 5 multiplied by 6 is 30. And 12 divided by 4 is 3.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to 30 / 3.\n\nFinally, 30 divided by 3 is 10.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 10.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me write it down again: ((3^2 - 4) * 6) / (12 / 4).\n\nFirst, parentheses: 3^2 is 9, minus 4 is 5. So, (5) * 6 is 30.\n\nThen, the denominator: 12 / 4 is 3.\n\nSo, 30 / 3 is indeed 10.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are any other interpretations of the expression, but I think the parentheses make it clear that it's (3^2 - 4) multiplied by 6, all divided by (12 / 4).\n\nNo, I don't think there's any ambiguity here.\n\nSo, the answer is definitely 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
