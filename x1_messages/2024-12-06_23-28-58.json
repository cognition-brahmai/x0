        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangular room that's 10 meters by 15 meters, and I need to cover the entire floor with square tiles that are 1 meter by 1 meter each. The catch is, I can only buy these tiles in packs of 8. I need to figure out the minimum number of packs I need to buy to cover the whole floor.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many tiles I need in total. Since the room is 10m by 15m, that means the area is 10 times 15, which is 150 square meters. And since each tile is 1m by 1m, or 1 square meter, I need 150 tiles to cover the floor.\n\nNow, tiles come in packs of 8. So, I need to divide the total number of tiles by the number of tiles per pack to find out how many packs I need. That would be 150 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do that division: 150 divided by 8 is 18.75.\n\nBut I can't buy a fraction of a pack, right? So, I need to round up because I need to cover the entire floor. That means I need 19 packs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. 18 packs would give me 144 tiles, because 18 times 8 is 144. But I need 150 tiles, so 144 isn't enough. I'd be short by 6 tiles. So, I do need to buy an extra pack to cover those remaining tiles.\n\nTherefore, 19 packs would give me 152 tiles, which is more than enough to cover the 150 needed. I'd have 2 extra tiles, but that's better than coming up short.\n\nI think that's the minimum number of packs I need to buy. I could try to see if there's a way to minimize it further, but since I can't buy partial packs, 19 is the smallest whole number of packs that will give me at least 150 tiles.\n\nAlright, so the answer should be 19 packs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
