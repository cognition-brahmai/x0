        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a book with 100 pages, and if you open it randomly, what's the probability that the sum of the two facing page numbers is 101? Interesting, huh? I need to propose a few solutions, rank them, and pick the most probable one. Alright, let's dive in.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the problem clearly. When you open a book randomly, you're likely to see two facing pages, right? For example, if you open to page 10, you'd see pages 10 and 11. So, the question is asking for the probability that the sum of these two consecutive page numbers is 101.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I know that in a book, pages are numbered sequentially, and when you open the book, you see an even-numbered page on the left and an odd-numbered page on the right, assuming the book starts with page 1 on the right side.\n\nWait, but actually, in some books, page numbering starts on the right, and in others, it might start on the left. But for simplicity, I'll assume that page 1 is on the right, and page 2 is on the left, and so on.\n\nSo, if I open the book to page n and n+1, what's the probability that n + (n+1) = 101?\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\nn + (n + 1) = 101\n\nSo, 2n + 1 = 101\n\nThen, 2n = 100\n\nn = 50\n\nSo, if I open the book to pages 50 and 51, their sum is 101. Is that the only pair? Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe there are other pairs where the sum is 101. Let's check.\n\nSuppose I have pages a and b, where a < b, and a + b = 101.\n\nGiven that pages are consecutive, b = a + 1.\n\nSo, a + (a + 1) = 101, which again gives a = 50 and b = 51.\n\nSo, it seems like there's only one such pair.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to know the total number of possible pairs of facing pages.\n\nIn a 100-page book, how many such pairs are there?\n\nWell, pages are numbered from 1 to 100.\n\nBut since we're dealing with facing pages, and assuming that pages are arranged in such a way that opening the book shows two consecutive pages, then the possible pairs would be (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), ..., (99,100).\n\nWait, but in a physical book, you don't see pages 1 and 2 facing each other; usually, page 1 is on the right, and page 2 is on the left, but when you flip the page, you see pages 3 and 4 together, and so on.\n\nActually, in a physical book, pages are printed in signatures, but for simplicity, I'll assume that each opening shows two consecutive pages, starting from (1,2), (3,4), ..., up to (99,100).\n\nWait, no. In a physical book, when you open it, you see two pages at once, usually an even-numbered page on the left and an odd-numbered page on the right.\n\nWait, but in my earlier assumption, I considered pages 1 and 2 as facing pages, but in reality, in many books, page 1 is on the right, and page 2 is on the left, but when you flip the page, you're actually turning to page 3 on the right and page 4 on the left.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to think in terms of 'leafs' or 'bifolios', where each opening shows two pages.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps I should consider that there are 50 facing pairs in a 100-page book: (1,2), (3,4), ..., (99,100).\n\nWait, but in this case, each pair is (2k-1, 2k) for k from 1 to 50.\n\nSo, total number of possible pairs is 50.\n\nOut of these 50 pairs, how many have a sum of 101?\n\nFrom earlier, only the pair (50,51) sums to 101.\n\nBut according to my pairing scheme, pairs are (1,2), (3,4), ..., (99,100).\n\nWait, where does (50,51) fit in?\n\nWell, in this scheme, (50,51) would be one of the pairs.\n\nSo, only one pair out of 50 satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50.\n\nWait, but is this correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal number of facing pairs: 50.\n\nFavorable pairs: only one, which is (50,51).\n\nTherefore, probability is 1/50 = 0.02 or 2%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that pages can be opened to any pair, not necessarily in the order I assumed.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose that the book can be opened to any page, and the two facing pages are considered.\n\nBut in reality, in a physical book, you can't open it to any arbitrary pair of pages; you can only open it to specific spread, which shows two consecutive pages.\n\nUnless the book is unbound or something, but I'll assume it's a regular bound book.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible facing pairs is 50, and only one of them sums to 101.\n\nHence, the probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the pages as being arranged in a specific way.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's think about the sum of two consecutive pages.\n\nIf the left page is even-numbered and the right is odd-numbered, then the sum would be even + odd = odd.\n\n101 is odd, so that checks out.\n\nSo, for any pair of consecutive pages, their sum is odd.\n\nBut specifically, we want the sum to be 101.\n\nAs earlier, only one pair satisfies this: (50,51).\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting a random page and considering the facing page.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nSuppose I open the book to a random page, say page n.\n\nThen, the facing page is n+1, assuming n is on the left and n+1 is on the right.\n\nThen, the sum is n + (n+1) = 2n + 1.\n\nWe want this to be equal to 101.\n\nSo, 2n + 1 = 101 => 2n = 100 => n = 50.\n\nSo, only when n = 50, the sum is 101.\n\nSince n can be any page from 1 to 99 (because page 100 doesn't have a following page in the book), there are 99 possible values for n.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I considered only 50 facing pairs.\n\nNow, considering n from 1 to 99, and for each n, the facing page is n+1, which seems consistent.\n\nBut earlier, I considered only every other pair, assuming the physical arrangement of the book.\n\nMaybe I need to clarify the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet me consider that each opening shows two consecutive pages: (1,2), (3,4), ..., (99,100).\n\nSo, there are 50 such openings.\n\nOnly one of them, (50,51), sums to 101.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that any page can be on the left, and the facing page is always the next one, then total possible pairs are indeed 50.\n\nHence, probability is 1/50.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the book can be opened to any page, and each page is equally likely.\n\nBut in reality, each opening is equally likely.\n\nSince there are 50 possible openings, and only one satisfies the condition, the probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends that any page can be on the left, and the facing page is always the next one.\n\nIn that case, total number of possible pairs is 99: (1,2), (2,3), ..., (99,100).\n\nThen, only one favorable pair: (50,51).\n\nTherefore, probability is 1/99.\n\nWait, but in a physical book, not all pairs like (2,3) are facing pages.\n\nUsually, facing pages are (1,2), (3,4), etc., in sequences.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't specify the physical arrangement.\n\nMaybe it's just about selecting two consecutive pages at random from 1 to 100, and finding the probability that their sum is 101.\n\nIn that case, total number of consecutive pairs is 99, and only one satisfies the condition.\n\nHence, probability is 1/99.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book is arranged in such a way that openings show (1,2), (3,4), ..., (99,100), and each opening is equally likely to be selected.\n\nIn that case, total number of possible outcomes is 50, and only one favorable, so probability is 1/50.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation is more accurate.\n\nLet me consider the problem statement again: \"If you open the book completely randomly, what is the probability that the sum of the two facing page numbers is 101?\"\n\nI think the key phrase is \"completely randomly,\" which might imply that any opening is equally likely.\n\nGiven that, and assuming a standard book arrangement where each opening shows two consecutive pages, then there are 50 possible openings.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that any two consecutive pages can be faced, regardless of the physical arrangement, then total pairs are 99.\n\nBut I think the first interpretation is more appropriate.\n\nHence, the probability is 1/50.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that some books have a different arrangement, where openings show pages in a different sequence.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll stick with 50 possible openings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that the sum of two facing pages is n + (n+1) = 2n + 1.\n\nWe set this equal to 101, so 2n + 1 = 101 => n = 50.\n\nTherefore, only when n = 50, the sum is 101.\n\nNow, what is the range of n?\n\nWell, n can be from 1 to 99, as page 100 doesn't have a next page.\n\nTherefore, there are 99 possible values for n, and only one favorable, so probability is 1/99.\n\nWait, but in the context of opening the book to a random opening, where each opening shows two consecutive pages, and there are 50 such openings, then only one favorable, so probability is 1/50.\n\nI think this is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the book can be opened to any page, and the two facing pages could be any pair of consecutive pages.\n\nIn that case, total number of possible pairs is 99, and only one favorable, so probability is 1/99.\n\nBut considering the physical arrangement of the book, I think 1/50 is more accurate.\n\nHence, the final answer is 1/50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{50}} \\]"
