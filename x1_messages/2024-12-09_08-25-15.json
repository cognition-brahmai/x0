        "content": "I've got this riddle here: \"Lighter than what I am made of, More of me is hidden Than is seen.\" Hmm, riddles are always tricky, but let's see if I can figure this one out.\n\nFirst, it says \"lighter than what I am made of.\" That sounds a bit confusing because usually, something is as heavy as its components. But here, it's lighter than what it's made of. So maybe there's some kind of illusion or something about the composition that makes it seem lighter.\n\nThen, \"more of me is hidden than is seen.\" That suggests that only a part of it is visible, and a larger part is not visible or hidden from view.\n\nLet me think about things that are lighter than their components. Hmm, a helium balloon comes to mind because helium is lighter than air, so the balloon floats. But is more of the balloon hidden than seen? Not really; the balloon is entirely visible.\n\nWait, maybe it's icebergs. Icebergs are made of ice, which is made from water, and ice is lighter than water, so they float. And it's known that most of an iceberg is hidden below the water surface, with only a small part visible above water. That seems to fit both parts of the riddle.\n\nLet me check: lighter than what it's made of\u2014ice is lighter than water, so it floats. More of it is hidden than seen\u2014only about 10% is above water, and 90% is below. Yep, that matches.\n\nBut maybe there are other answers. Let's consider air bubbles. Air bubbles in water are lighter than water, so they float to the surface. And most of the bubble's volume is hidden within the water until it reaches the surface. But once it reaches the surface, it pops or merges with the air. So, perhaps not the best fit.\n\nAnother thought: submarines. They can be lighter or heavier than water by adjusting their ballast tanks. But submarines are man-made, and the riddle seems to suggest something more natural.\n\nOr maybe it's clouds. Clouds are made of water vapor, which is lighter than air, allowing them to float. And most of the cloud is hidden from view, especially the parts that are higher up or not directly visible. That could work.\n\nBut comparing clouds and icebergs, icebergs seem to fit both parts of the riddle more precisely. Clouds are made of water vapor, which is lighter than air, but water vapor itself isn't exactly \"made of\" something else in the same way ice is made of water.\n\nWait, maybe it's submarines again, but let's think differently. Submarines can submerge and only a small part is visible when they're near the surface. But again, they're man-made, and the riddle seems to suggest something more natural.\n\nAnother angle: mountains. Mountains are made of earth and rock, which are heavy, but perhaps the part above ground is lighter than the base or something. Hmm, not sure about that.\n\nHow about underground caves? Caves are hollow spaces within the earth, so the area inside the cave is lighter than the surrounding rock because it's empty space. And most of the cave is hidden from view unless you explore it. That could be a possibility.\n\nBut comparing caves, icebergs, and clouds, icebergs seem to fit both criteria very well.\n\nLet me see if there's a different interpretation. \"Lighter than what I am made of\"\u2014could this refer to something that expands or has internal space?\n\nLike a balloon again, but I already considered that.\n\nOr perhaps foam. Foam is made of a material, but it's full of air pockets, so it's lighter than the solid form of that material. And maybe more of the foam is hidden if it's underwater or something.\n\nBut again, icebergs seem like a better fit.\n\nAlternatively, think about ice cubes in a drink. The ice cubes are made of water, which is heavier than ice, so they float with only a part visible above the liquid. But that's similar to icebergs.\n\nWait, maybe it's just any floating object, like a wooden log. Wood is lighter than water, so it floats, and perhaps more of it is hidden below the surface than is visible above.\n\nBut icebergs are a more classic example, and they fit the riddle well.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more abstract answer. Maybe it's light itself, or something intangible.\n\nBut the riddle mentions being \"made of\" something, which suggests a physical substance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a balloon filled with helium, as I thought earlier. Helium is lighter than air, so the balloon floats. And perhaps more of the balloon's mass is hidden in the helium gas than is seen in the balloon's material.\n\nBut again, icebergs seem like a more straightforward and classic answer.\n\nI think I'll go with icebergs as the answer to this riddle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{iceberg}} \\]"
