        "content": "Let's see. There are houses on both sides of the street, 10 on one side and 15 on the other, so that's a total of 10 plus 15, which is 25 houses. Each house has a dog, so there are 25 dogs in total. Now, each of these dogs barks at every cat that passes by. There are 5 cats in the neighborhood.\n\nSo, if one cat passes by, each dog barks once. That means for one cat, there would be 25 barks, one from each dog. Since there are 5 cats, and each cat causes each dog to bark once, then for 5 cats, it would be 25 barks per cat times 5 cats.\n\nLet me calculate that: 25 multiplied by 5 is 125. So, the dogs bark 125 times in total when all the cats pass by.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again.\n\nEach dog barks at every cat that passes by. So, for each cat, every dog barks once. Therefore, per cat, it's 25 barks. There are 5 cats, so total barks should be 25 times 5, which is indeed 125.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as each dog barking 5 times, once for each cat. So, 25 dogs each barking 5 times would also be 125 barks.\n\nYeah, I think that makes sense. There doesn't seem to be any tricky part in this problem; it's straightforward once you total up the number of dogs and multiply by the number of cats.\n\nI don't see any other factors to consider, like dogs barking at each other or something like that. The problem seems pretty clear: each dog barks at every cat that passes by, and there are 5 cats.\n\nSo, my final answer is 125 barks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
