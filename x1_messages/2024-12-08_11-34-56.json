        "content": "So if a bacteria population doubles every 3 hours, and we want to know how many times it will have doubled after 24 hours, right? Okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what \"doubling every 3 hours\" means. It means that every 3-hour period, the number of bacteria increases by a factor of 2. So, if we start with, say, 1 bacterium, after 3 hours, there will be 2 bacteria; after another 3 hours (so, 6 hours total), there will be 4 bacteria; and so on.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number of times the population has doubled after 24 hours. So, we need to find out how many 3-hour periods there are in 24 hours.\n\nTo find that, we can divide 24 hours by 3 hours per doubling period. So, 24 divided by 3 is 8. That means there are 8 doubling periods in 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the bacteria population will have doubled 8 times after 24 hours.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If it doubles every 3 hours, then:\n\n- At time 0: initial amount\n\n- After 3 hours: doubles once\n\n- After 6 hours: doubles twice\n\n- After 9 hours: doubles three times\n\n- After 12 hours: doubles four times\n\n- After 15 hours: doubles five times\n\n- After 18 hours: doubles six times\n\n- After 21 hours: doubles seven times\n\n- After 24 hours: doubles eight times\n\nYes, that adds up to 8 times.\n\nSo, the answer is that the bacteria population will have doubled 8 times after 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
