        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges two things: a daily rental fee and a per-mile fee. The daily fee is $25 per day, and the per-mile fee is $0.15 for each mile driven. The customer rents the car for 4 days and drives it for 200 miles. I need to find the total cost.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the days rented. Since it's $25 per day for 4 days, I can multiply 25 by 4.\n\n25 * 4 = 100\n\nSo, the cost for the days rented is $100.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost for the miles driven. It's $0.15 per mile for 200 miles. So, I'll multiply 0.15 by 200.\n\n0.15 * 200 = 30\n\nSo, the cost for the miles driven is $30.\n\nNow, I'll add both costs to get the total cost.\n\n100 + 30 = 130\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the rental is $130.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other fee that I might have missed? Sometimes rental companies have additional fees like taxes or insurance. But based on the information given, it seems like only the daily and per-mile fees are mentioned. So, I think $130 is the total cost.\n\nJust to double-check, let me read the problem again: \"A car rental company charges $25 per day for renting a car and an additional fee of $0.15 per mile driven. If a customer rents a car for 4 days and drives it for 200 miles, what is the total cost of the rental?\"\n\nYes, that's all the information provided. So, my calculation should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{130} \\]"
