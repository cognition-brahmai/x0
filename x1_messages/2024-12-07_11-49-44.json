Short-term memory, also known as working memory, is where information is temporarily held and manipulated. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is where information is stored indefinitely. The process of transferring information from short-term to long-term memory is known as consolidation. Which of the following statements about memory is true according to cognitive psychology?\nA. Short-term memory has unlimited capacity\nB. Long-term memory is only for factual information\nC. Consolidation is the process of forgetting information\nD. Working memory is another term for long-term memory\nE. Working memory is another term for short-term memory"

        "content": "Let's dive into this question about memory in cognitive psychology. So, memory is a big topic, and it's often split into short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory, also called working memory, is like our brain's scratch pad where we hold onto information temporarily and work with it. Long-term memory is like the brain's library where we store information for the long haul.\n\nNow, there's this process called consolidation, which is basically how information moves from short-term to long-term memory. It's like filing away important papers so you can find them later.\n\nThe question is asking which statement about memory is true according to cognitive psychology. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Short-term memory has unlimited capacity.\n\nHmm, I don't think that's right. From what I know, short-term memory has limited space. That's why phone numbers are usually short\u2014they're designed to fit into our short-term memory easily.\n\nB. Long-term memory is only for factual information.\n\nWait, isn't long-term memory for more than just facts? I think it also stores skills, experiences, and even procedural memory, like how to ride a bike. So, this seems too narrow.\n\nC. Consolidation is the process of forgetting information.\n\nNo, that can't be right. Consolidation is about strengthening memories and making them more permanent, not forgetting them. Forgetting is more like the opposite process.\n\nD. Working memory is another term for long-term memory.\n\nI don't think so. Working memory is synonymous with short-term memory, not long-term memory.\n\nE. Working memory is another term for short-term memory.\n\nThis seems familiar. Yeah, I've read that working memory and short-term memory are often used interchangeably, although there are subtle differences in how psychologists conceptualize them.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check that. Some sources might distinguish between working memory and short-term memory. Working memory emphasizes the active processing of information, while short-term memory might just refer to the temporary storage.\n\nBut for the purpose of this question, it seems like E is the correct statement.\n\nLet me just recap:\n\n- A is incorrect because short-term memory has limited capacity.\n\n- B is incorrect because long-term memory stores more than just factual information.\n\n- C is incorrect because consolidation is about strengthening memories, not forgetting them.\n\n- D is incorrect because working memory is not the same as long-term memory.\n\n- E is correct because working memory is another term for short-term memory.\n\nAlthough, I should note that while they are related, some researchers make distinctions between them. But in general, for this context, E seems to be the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
