The question is, how many pineapples does she have left?\n\nHmm, wait a minute. The problem mentions oranges and apples, but it's asking about pineapples. Did Sarah have any pineapples to begin with? The problem doesn't say anything about pineapples initially. It only mentions oranges and apples.\n\nSo, if Sarah didn't have any pineapples to start with, and the trade was between oranges and apples, then she still hasn't acquired any pineapples. Therefore, the number of pineapples she has left should be zero.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something here. Maybe there's a trick or a misunderstanding in the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Sarah has 15 oranges. She trades 5 oranges for 10 apples. How many pineapples does she have left?\"\n\nStill, no mention of pineapples anywhere. It seems like a straightforward conclusion that she has zero pineapples left because she never had any to begin with and the trade didn't involve pineapples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"pineapples\" was a typo, and the question intended to ask about oranges or apples. But as it's written, it's asking about pineapples.\n\nSo, my final answer is that Sarah has 0 pineapples left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
