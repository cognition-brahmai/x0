        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a particle moving along a straight line. The acceleration is given as a function of time, a(t) = 6t - 4. I also know the initial velocity, v(0) = 10, and the initial position, s(0) = 0. I need to find the position function s(t). Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. So, if a(t) = 6t - 4, then velocity v(t) should be the antiderivative of a(t). That means I need to integrate a(t) to find v(t).\n\nSo, v(t) = \u222ba(t) dt = \u222b(6t - 4) dt.\n\nIntegrating 6t gives 3t\u00b2, and integrating -4 gives -4t. So, v(t) = 3t\u00b2 - 4t + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, I know that v(0) = 10. So, plugging t = 0 into v(t), I get:\n\n10 = 3(0)\u00b2 - 4(0) + C \u21d2 C = 10.\n\nTherefore, v(t) = 3t\u00b2 - 4t + 10.\n\nNext, I know that velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time. So, s(t) should be the antiderivative of v(t). That means I need to integrate v(t) to find s(t).\n\nSo, s(t) = \u222bv(t) dt = \u222b(3t\u00b2 - 4t + 10) dt.\n\nIntegrating 3t\u00b2 gives t\u00b3, integrating -4t gives -2t\u00b2, and integrating 10 gives 10t. So, s(t) = t\u00b3 - 2t\u00b2 + 10t + D, where D is another constant of integration.\n\nNow, I know that s(0) = 0. So, plugging t = 0 into s(t), I get:\n\n0 = (0)\u00b3 - 2(0)\u00b2 + 10(0) + D \u21d2 D = 0.\n\nTherefore, the position function is s(t) = t\u00b3 - 2t\u00b2 + 10t.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from a(t) = 6t - 4, integrating to find v(t), I get v(t) = 3t\u00b2 - 4t + C, and with v(0) = 10, C = 10. Then, integrating v(t) to find s(t), I get s(t) = t\u00b3 - 2t\u00b2 + 10t + D, and with s(0) = 0, D = 0. So, s(t) = t\u00b3 - 2t\u00b2 + 10t.\n\nI think that's correct. [Final Answer]\n\n\\[ \\boxed{s(t) = t^3 - 2t^2 + 10t} \\]"
