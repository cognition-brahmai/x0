        "content": "I'm here to help! Let's see, you're asking about a U.S. President and his Vice President during the Civil War era who were both born in log cabins. Hmm, the Civil War was in the 1860s, so I need to think about Presidents from that time period.\n\nAbraham Lincoln is probably the most famous President from that era. He was known for being born in a log cabin, right? I think his early life was quite humble, and he rose from poverty to become President. So, Lincoln was definitely born in a log cabin.\n\nNow, I need to find out who his Vice President was during the Civil War. I believe his first Vice President was Hannibal Hamlin, and then for his second term, it was Andrew Johnson.\n\nLet me check about Hannibal Hamlin first. Was he born in a log cabin? I'm not entirely sure. I know he was from Maine, and perhaps log cabins were common in that area back then.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was Andrew Johnson who was born in a log cabin. I recall that Andrew Johnson had a humble background as well.\n\nWait a minute, Abraham Lincoln was the President during the Civil War, and Andrew Johnson was his Vice President for his second term.\n\nLet me verify if both were born in log cabins.\n\nAbraham Lincoln: Born in a one-room log cabin in Kentucky in 1809. That's well-known.\n\nAndrew Johnson: Born in North Carolina in 1808 in a log cabin as well. His family was poor, and he had to work from a young age.\n\nSo, both Lincoln and Johnson were born in log cabins.\n\nBut Hannibal Hamlin, Lincoln's first Vice President, was born in Maine in 1809. I'm not sure about his birthplace being a log cabin, but it's possible.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies \"both\" serving during the Civil War era, and both being born in log cabins, it seems that Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson fit this description.\n\nLet me make sure there aren't any other Presidents from that era who were born in log cabins.\n\nUlysses S. Grant, who became President after Lincoln, was born in 1822 in Ohio, possibly in a log cabin as well, but since he wasn't Vice President during the Civil War, he doesn't fit.\n\nSo, I think the answer is Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson}} \\]"
