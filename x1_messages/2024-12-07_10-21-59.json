        "content": "So the plane is flying at two different speeds for different durations, right? First, it flies at 500 miles per hour for 7 hours, and then it increases its speed to 600 miles per hour for another 5 hours. We need to find out the total distance it travels.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part of the flight, the distance would be 500 mph times 7 hours. Let me do that calculation:\n\n500 miles/hour * 7 hours = 3,500 miles.\n\nOkay, so in the first part, the plane travels 3,500 miles.\n\nNow, for the second part, it's flying at 600 mph for 5 hours. So, the distance for this part would be:\n\n600 miles/hour * 5 hours = 3,000 miles.\n\nSo, in the second part, the plane travels 3,000 miles.\n\nTo find the total distance traveled, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\n3,500 miles + 3,000 miles = 6,500 miles.\n\nTherefore, the plane will have traveled a total of 6,500 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe combining the speeds and times somehow. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total distance as the sum of the products of speed and time for each segment of the flight.\n\nSo, total distance = (speed1 * time1) + (speed2 * time2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal distance = (500 mph * 7 hours) + (600 mph * 5 hours) = 3,500 miles + 3,000 miles = 6,500 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there a formula for this kind of thing? I think it's just the basic distance formula, distance equals speed multiplied by time.\n\nI don't think there's anything more complicated going on here, like accounting for acceleration or anything like that. The problem just gives straight speeds and times, so it's straightforward multiplication and addition.\n\nLet me check if the units make sense. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so when multiplied, the hours cancel out, leaving miles, which is correct for distance.\n\nAlso, adding the two distances together makes sense because they're both in the same unit, miles.\n\nI don't think there's any need to convert units or anything like that.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the total distance traveled is 6,500 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6500} \\]"
