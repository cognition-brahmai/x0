        "content": "So the beverage company is looking to expand their product line with a new flavor, and they want to do some market research by conducting taste tests. They've planned to have 5,000 participants, and each participant will get a sample of the new flavor along with a survey form to give their feedback.\n\nFirst, they need to produce these samples. They're planning to make 6,000 samples in total. That's a bit more than the number of participants, which makes sense because they might need some extras just in case some samples get messed up or there are more participants than expected. Each sample costs $1 to produce. So, to find out the total cost for the samples, I'll multiply the number of samples by the cost per sample:\n\n6,000 samples * $1/sample = $6,000\n\nThat's the cost for the samples.\n\nNext, there are the survey forms. Each participant gets one survey form, so that's 5,000 forms. But, the cost is $2 per survey form for printing and processing. So, the total cost for the survey forms would be:\n\n5,000 forms * $2/form = $10,000\n\nNow, to find the total cost of producing the samples and conducting the taste test, I need to add the cost of the samples and the cost of the survey forms together:\n\n$6,000 (samples) + $10,000 (survey forms) = $16,000\n\nSo, the total cost is $16,000.\n\nBut, wait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Oh, the problem says they're producing 6,000 samples, but only 5,000 participants. Does that mean they have extra samples that might not get used? Well, probably, but they still have to produce them, so the cost is incurred regardless.\n\nAlso, it says \"each participant will receive a sample and a survey form.\" So, even if there are extra samples, the survey forms are only needed for the participants, which are 5,000. So, that seems correct.\n\nIs there any other expense mentioned? Just the samples and the survey forms. So, adding those up should give the total cost.\n\nAlright, so my final answer is $16,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16000} \\]"
