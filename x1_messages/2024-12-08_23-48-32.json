        "content": "So the mayor has to paint all the house numbers from 1 to 100, and he needs one bottle of paint for every digit he paints. I need to figure out how many bottles he needs in total. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand how many digits are in each house number. For example, house number 1 is a single digit, house number 10 has two digits, and so on.\n\nSo, let's categorize the house numbers based on how many digits they have.\n\n- Houses 1 through 9 are single-digit numbers. There are 9 houses here (1 to 9), each with 1 digit. So, that's 9 digits.\n\n- Houses 10 through 99 are two-digit numbers. There are 90 houses here (10 to 99), each with 2 digits. So, that's 90 houses \u00d7 2 digits = 180 digits.\n\n- House 100 is a three-digit number. There's 1 house here (100), with 3 digits. So, that's 3 digits.\n\nNow, I just need to add up all these digits to find the total number of bottles needed.\n\nTotal bottles = digits from 1-9 + digits from 10-99 + digits from 100\n\nThat is: 9 + 180 + 3 = 192 bottles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Houses 1-9: 9 houses \u00d7 1 digit each = 9 digits.\n\nHouses 10-99: 90 houses \u00d7 2 digits each = 180 digits.\n\nHouse 100: 1 house \u00d7 3 digits = 3 digits.\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 180 + 3 indeed equals 192.\n\nSo, the mayor needs 192 bottles of paint.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should verify this again.\n\nLet's consider that from 1 to 99, there are 9 single-digit numbers and 90 two-digit numbers.\n\nTotal digits from 1 to 99: (9 \u00d7 1) + (90 \u00d7 2) = 9 + 180 = 189 digits.\n\nAdding the digits from house 100: 189 + 3 = 192 digits.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\n- From 1 to 99:\n\n- The tens place is filled for numbers 10-99, which is 90 digits (since 10 has a '1' in the tens place, 11 has a '1', up to 99 has a '9').\n\n- The units place is filled for all numbers 1-99, which is 99 digits (since even single-digit numbers have a units digit).\n\n- But wait, that might be double-counting or missing something.\n\nActually, maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach, as it seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way is to consider that:\n\n- For houses 1-9: 9 digits.\n\n- For houses 10-99: 90 houses \u00d7 2 digits = 180 digits.\n\n- For house 100: 3 digits.\n\nTotal: 9 + 180 + 3 = 192 digits, hence 192 bottles.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the number of digits in each range:\n\n- 1 digit for each house from 1-9: 9 digits.\n\n- 2 digits for each house from 10-99: 90 houses \u00d7 2 = 180 digits.\n\n- 3 digits for house 100: 3 digits.\n\nSumming these gives 9 + 180 + 3 = 192.\n\nI can also consider that from 1 to 100, the total number of digits used is equal to the number of houses minus the number of houses with leading zeros if we consider all numbers as three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, that might be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of place values:\n\n- Units place: filled for all 100 houses.\n\n- Tens place: filled for houses 10-99, which is 90 houses.\n\n- Hundreds place: filled only for house 100, which is 1 house.\n\nSo, total digits = units (100) + tens (90) + hundreds (1) = 191 digits.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match my previous total of 192.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nLet's think again:\n\n- Units place: all 100 houses have a units digit, so 100 digits.\n\n- Tens place: houses 10-99 have a tens digit, which is 90 houses, so 90 digits.\n\n- Hundreds place: only house 100 has a hundreds digit, which is 1 digit.\n\nSo, total digits = 100 (units) + 90 (tens) + 1 (hundreds) = 191 digits.\n\nBut earlier, I had 192 digits. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check house number 100.\n\nHouse 100 has digits: 1, 0, 0.\n\nSo, that's three digits.\n\nIn the first method, I counted them all.\n\nIn the second method, I counted:\n\n- Units place: 0 (from 100)\n\n- Tens place: 0 (from 100)\n\n- Hundreds place: 1 (from 100)\n\nSo, that's three digits, which seems consistent.\n\nBut when I added up units (100), tens (90), and hundreds (1), I get 191.\n\nBut in the first method, I had 9 (for 1-9) + 180 (for 10-99) + 3 (for 100) = 192.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an overlap or miscount.\n\nLet me consider house numbers 1 to 99 first.\n\nFor houses 1 to 99:\n\n- Units place: 99 houses have a units digit.\n\n- Tens place: 90 houses have a tens digit (houses 10-99).\n\nSo, total digits for 1-99: 99 (units) + 90 (tens) = 189 digits.\n\nAdding house 100: 3 digits.\n\nTotal: 189 + 3 = 192 digits.\n\nBut earlier, I had 100 (units) + 90 (tens) + 1 (hundreds) = 191.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm including house 100's units digit twice.\n\nIn the units place count, house 100 has a units digit of 0, which is already included in the 100 units digits.\n\nSimilarly, its tens digit is 0, included in the tens place count.\n\nAnd its hundreds digit is 1.\n\nBut in the place value method, I'm summing units (100), tens (90), and hundreds (1), totaling 191.\n\nHowever, in the initial method, I separately counted houses 1-9 (9 digits), 10-99 (180 digits), and 100 (3 digits), totaling 192.\n\nThere's a discrepancy of one digit here.\n\nI need to resolve this.\n\nLet me count the digits again using the place value method, being careful not to double-count.\n\n- Units place: every house has a units digit, so 100 digits.\n\n- Tens place: houses 10-99 have a tens digit, which is 90 houses, so 90 digits.\n\n- Hundreds place: only house 100 has a hundreds digit, which is 1 digit.\n\nTotal digits: 100 + 90 + 1 = 191 digits.\n\nBut according to the first method, it's 192.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first method, I miscounted the houses 1-9.\n\nLet me re-examine that.\n\nHouses 1-9: these are single-digit numbers, so each has 1 digit. There are 9 houses, so 9 digits.\n\nHouses 10-99: these are two-digit numbers, 90 houses, each with 2 digits, so 180 digits.\n\nHouse 100: 3 digits.\n\nTotal: 9 + 180 + 3 = 192 digits.\n\nBut according to the place value method, it's 191 digits.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can calculate the total number of digits by considering the number of digits in each house number and summing them up.\n\nSo:\n\n- Houses 1-9: 9 houses \u00d7 1 digit each = 9 digits.\n\n- Houses 10-99: 90 houses \u00d7 2 digits each = 180 digits.\n\n- House 100: 1 house \u00d7 3 digits = 3 digits.\n\nTotal: 9 + 180 + 3 = 192 digits.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the place value method, I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider:\n\n- Units place: houses 1-100 have a units digit, so 100 digits.\n\n- Tens place: houses 10-99 have a tens digit, so 90 digits.\n\n- Hundreds place: only house 100 has a hundreds digit, so 1 digit.\n\nTotal: 100 + 90 + 1 = 191 digits.\n\nWait, the discrepancy is in the units digit count.\n\nIn the place value method, I'm counting the units digit for all 100 houses, including house 100.\n\nBut in the first method, I'm separately counting the digits for houses 1-9, 10-99, and 100.\n\nWait, perhaps house 100 is being counted correctly in both methods, and the total is indeed 192.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the place value method is incorrect.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nIn the place value method, for houses 1-9, they have only a units digit, which is already included in the 100 units digits.\n\nHouses 10-99 have both tens and units digits, which are included in the tens (90 digits) and units (90 digits, since houses 10-99 have units digits) places.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the units digits.\n\nLet me try to count the units digits correctly.\n\nFor houses 1-99:\n\n- Each house has a units digit, so 99 units digits.\n\n- Houses 10-99 have a tens digit, so 90 tens digits.\n\n- House 100 has a hundreds digit, tens digit, and units digit.\n\nSo, total digits: 99 (units) + 90 (tens) + 1 (hundreds) + 0 (since units and tens of 100 are already counted) = 190 digits.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that house 100 adds one additional digit beyond the tens and units already counted.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI can list out the digits for the first few and last few houses to see the pattern.\n\nFor houses 1 to 10:\n\n- 1: 1 digit\n\n- 2: 1 digit\n\n- ...\n\n- 9: 1 digit\n\n- 10: 2 digits\n\nSo, total for 1-10: 9 \u00d7 1 + 1 \u00d7 2 = 11 digits.\n\nFor houses 11 to 20: 10 houses \u00d7 2 digits each = 20 digits.\n\nSimilarly, for houses 21 to 30: another 20 digits, and so on up to houses 90-99: 20 digits.\n\nSo, from houses 10 to 99: 90 houses \u00d7 2 digits = 180 digits.\n\nHouse 100: 3 digits.\n\nTotal: digits from 1-9 (9) + digits from 10-99 (180) + digits from 100 (3) = 192 digits.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this.\n\nThe total number of digits used to write all numbers from 1 to n can be calculated by summing the number of digits in each range.\n\nFor n = 100:\n\n- Digits from 1 to 9: 9 \u00d7 1 = 9\n\n- Digits from 10 to 99: 90 \u00d7 2 = 180\n\n- Digits from 100: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\nTotal: 9 + 180 + 3 = 192 digits.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the total number of digits from 1 to n:\n\nTotal digits = floor(log10(n)) * (n - 10^floor(log10(n))) + sum for i from 0 to floor(log10(n)) of 9 * 10^i * (i + 1)\n\nBut that seems complicated for this scenario.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the initial straightforward approach.\n\nTherefore, the mayor needs 192 bottles of paint.\n\nBut earlier, I had a discrepancy with the place value method giving 191 digits.\n\nI think the place value method might be missing a digit.\n\nLet me re-examine it.\n\nIn the place value method:\n\n- Units place: 100 digits (houses 1-100)\n\n- Tens place: 90 digits (houses 10-99)\n\n- Hundreds place: 1 digit (house 100)\n\nTotal: 100 + 90 + 1 = 191 digits.\n\nBut according to the other method, it's 192.\n\nI think the issue is that in the place value method, the tens digit of house 100 is being ignored.\n\nWait, no. In the place value method, I considered that only houses 10-99 have a tens digit, which is 90 digits, and house 100 has a hundreds digit, which is 1 digit.\n\nBut house 100 also has a tens digit '0', which is being overlooked in this method.\n\nSo, the correct place value counts should be:\n\n- Units place: 100 digits (houses 1-100)\n\n- Tens place: 90 digits (houses 10-99) + 1 digit (house 100's tens digit) = 91 digits\n\n- Hundreds place: 1 digit (house 100)\n\nTotal: 100 + 91 + 1 = 192 digits.\n\nYes, that matches the initial count.\n\nSo, the place value method also gives 192 digits when properly accounted for.\n\nTherefore, the mayor needs 192 bottles of paint.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that house 100 has digits in the hundreds, tens, and units places, and we count them separately, we get 3 digits for house 100, which, when added to the digits from houses 1-99 (189 digits), gives a total of 192 digits.\n\nHence, the final answer is 192 bottles of paint.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192} \\]"
