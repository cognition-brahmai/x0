        "content": "So the airline company is trying to decide whether to buy new planes or lease used ones. They need to figure out after how many years it makes more sense to buy new planes based on cost. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's understand the costs involved in both options.\n\nBuying new planes:\n\n- Cost: $100 million per plane\n\n- Lifespan: 20 years\n\nLeasing used planes:\n\n- Annual cost: $2 million per year per plane\n\n- They can lease these planes for as many years as they need\n\nThe company wants to know the break-even point in years, meaning after how many years the total cost of buying equals the total cost of leasing.\n\nSo, to find the break-even point, we need to set the total cost of buying equal to the total cost of leasing and solve for the number of years.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( C_{buy} \\) = cost of buying a new plane = $100 million\n\n- \\( C_{lease} \\) = annual leasing cost per plane = $2 million per year\n\n- \\( n \\) = number of years\n\nThe total cost of buying the plane over \\( n \\) years would be the initial cost, which is $100 million, and since they operate each plane for 20 years, but we're looking at the cost over \\( n \\) years where \\( n \\) could be less than or equal to 20 years.\n\nWait, but the plane is operational for 20 years, so if they buy a new plane, the $100 million is a one-time cost, and it's spread over 20 years of operation.\n\nSimilarly, leasing costs $2 million per year, indefinitely, as long as they lease the plane.\n\nSo, to compare the two options, we need to calculate the total cost over \\( n \\) years for both options and find the value of \\( n \\) where the total costs are equal.\n\nLet's define the total cost for buying over \\( n \\) years.\n\nSince the plane costs $100 million upfront and is used for 20 years, if \\( n \\leq 20 \\), the cost per year is \\( \\frac{100 \\text{ million}}{20 \\text{ years}} = 5 \\text{ million per year} \\).\n\nWait, but actually, the $100 million is a one-time cost, and it's spread over 20 years, so the annualized cost would be \\( \\frac{100 \\text{ million}}{20} = 5 \\text{ million per year} \\).\n\nOn the other hand, leasing costs $2 million per year.\n\nSo, the total cost of buying over \\( n \\) years is \\( 5 \\text{ million} \\times n \\).\n\nThe total cost of leasing over \\( n \\) years is \\( 2 \\text{ million} \\times n \\).\n\nWait, but this can't be right because if they buy the plane, they pay $100 million upfront, and then use it for 20 years, so the annual cost is indeed $5 million per year.\n\nLeasing is $2 million per year.\n\nSo, the total cost of buying over \\( n \\) years is $100 million, plus opportunity cost, but if we're looking at it on an annual basis, it's $5 million per year.\n\nBut perhaps we should consider the time value of money, but for simplicity, let's assume that's not a factor here.\n\nSo, the total cost of buying over \\( n \\) years is \\( 5n \\) million dollars.\n\nThe total cost of leasing over \\( n \\) years is \\( 2n \\) million dollars.\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( n \\) where \\( 5n = 2n \\), but that would be \\( n = 0 \\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, this can't be right. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf they buy the plane, they pay $100 million upfront, and then use it for 20 years.\n\nSo, the total cost over 20 years is $100 million.\n\nIf they lease the plane for 20 years, they pay $2 million per year for 20 years, which totals $40 million.\n\nSo, over 20 years, leasing is cheaper.\n\nBut the question is asking for the break-even point in years where buying becomes more cost-effective than leasing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to set up the equation differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that buying is a one-time cost of $100 million, and leasing is $2 million per year.\n\nWe need to find the number of years \\( n \\) where the total leasing cost equals the buying cost.\n\nSo, \\( 2n = 100 \\)\n\nThen, \\( n = 50 \\) years.\n\nBut the plane's operational life is only 20 years, so beyond 20 years, they would need to buy another plane if they choose to buy.\n\nWait, that's another complication.\n\nAssuming they operate each plane for 20 years, if they buy a plane, it costs $100 million and lasts for 20 years.\n\nIf they lease, it's $2 million per year, indefinitely.\n\nSo, over 20 years, leasing would cost $40 million, which is less than $100 million.\n\nBut the question is about finding the break-even point in years where buying becomes more cost-effective.\n\nWait, maybe the break-even point is never reached, because leasing is always cheaper on a per-year basis.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the question's assumption that there is a break-even point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the break-even point is beyond the 20-year operational life of the plane.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that.\n\nIf they buy a plane for $100 million and it lasts for 20 years, the total cost is $100 million.\n\nIf they lease for 20 years, it's $2 million per year for 20 years, totaling $40 million.\n\nSo, leasing is cheaper by $60 million over 20 years.\n\nIf they lease for 50 years, it would cost $100 million, which matches the buying cost.\n\nBut since the plane only lasts 20 years, leasing for 50 years would require renewing the lease every 20 years, but that's not directly relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider the cost per year over the plane's life.\n\nSo, buying costs $100 million for 20 years, which is $5 million per year.\n\nLeasing costs $2 million per year.\n\nSo, leasing is cheaper by $3 million per year.\n\nAgain, this suggests that buying is never more cost-effective.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps the break-even point is being considered without factoring in the plane's operational life.\n\nLet\u2019s ignore the 20-year operational life for a moment and just consider the pure cost over \\( n \\) years.\n\nSo, buying costs $100 million upfront, and leasing costs $2 million per year.\n\nThe total cost of buying over \\( n \\) years is $100 million.\n\nThe total cost of leasing over \\( n \\) years is $2 million times \\( n \\).\n\nWe set these equal to find the break-even point:\n\n\\( 100 = 2n \\)\n\n\\( n = 50 \\) years.\n\nSo, after 50 years, the total cost of leasing ($100 million) equals the total cost of buying ($100 million).\n\nBeyond 50 years, leasing would cost more than buying.\n\nHowever, since the plane's operational life is only 20 years, if they buy one plane that lasts 20 years for $100 million, and if they want to operate for 50 years, they would need to buy three planes ($300 million), which is not comparable.\n\nAlternatively, if they lease for 50 years, it would cost $100 million, as calculated.\n\nSo, in reality, buying becomes more cost-effective only if they operate beyond 50 years, assuming they need to replace the plane every 20 years.\n\nBut again, this seems contradictory because leasing is cheaper in the short term and breaks even at 50 years, but beyond that, leasing becomes more expensive.\n\nHowever, since the plane's life is 20 years, and the break-even point is at 50 years, it might not be practical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at this.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the annual cost difference.\n\nBuying: $100 million upfront for 20 years, which is $5 million per year.\n\nLeasing: $2 million per year.\n\nSo, leasing saves $3 million per year compared to buying.\n\nBut over 20 years, leasing costs $40 million vs. $100 million for buying.\n\nSo, leasing is cheaper.\n\nUnless they operate beyond 20 years, in which case they'd need to buy another plane if they choose to buy.\n\nSo, for 40 years:\n\n- Buying: two planes at $100 million each, total $200 million.\n\n- Leasing: $2 million per year for 40 years, total $80 million.\n\nStill, leasing is cheaper.\n\nFor 50 years:\n\n- Buying: three planes at $100 million each, total $300 million.\n\n- Leasing: $2 million per year for 50 years, total $100 million.\n\nLeasing is still cheaper.\n\nSo, it seems that leasing is always cheaper, no matter how many years they operate, as long as the plane's operational life is 20 years and they have to buy a new plane every 20 years.\n\nTherefore, there is no break-even point where buying becomes more cost-effective than leasing.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something in the question.\n\nLet me read the question again.\n\n\"An airline company is considering expanding its fleet by purchasing additional aircraft. They need to decide between buying new planes or leasing used ones. New planes cost $100 million each, while leasing used planes costs $2 million per year per plane. The company expects to operate each plane for 20 years. Determine the break-even point for the number of years after which it would be more cost-effective to buy new planes rather than lease used ones.\"\n\nSo, the break-even point is being asked in terms of years.\n\nFrom the earlier calculation, if we ignore the operational life and just look at pure cost accumulation, the break-even point is at 50 years.\n\nBut considering the operational life is 20 years, and they would need to replace the plane every 20 years if they buy, then leasing remains cheaper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the plane's operational life is irrelevant beyond the purchasing decision.\n\nBut that seems unrealistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the leasing cost includes maintenance and other expenses, while buying does not, but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the break-even point is being considered based on the useful life of the plane.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the present value of the costs.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the present value.\n\nIf we discount the future costs, then the present value of leasing over \\( n \\) years would be \\( 2 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \\), where \\( r \\) is the discount rate.\n\nSimilarly, the present value of buying is $100 million upfront.\n\nSetting these equal would give the break-even point in years.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify a discount rate, so perhaps that's not the intended approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should consider that the plane can be sold at the end of its operational life.\n\nSuppose the plane has a residual value at the end of 20 years.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the plane can be sold for some salvage value.\n\nIf there's a salvage value, say \\( s \\) million dollars at the end of 20 years, then the total cost of buying would be $100 million minus \\( s \\) million.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify a salvage value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the residual value is zero, as per the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should assume that the plane has no residual value.\n\nIn that case, the total cost of buying is $100 million, and leasing is $2 million per year.\n\nSo, the break-even point is when the total leasing cost equals $100 million, which is at 50 years.\n\nBut again, considering the plane's life is only 20 years, buying is not more cost-effective within the plane's operational life.\n\nUnless there are other factors, such as maintenance costs being different for bought vs. leased planes.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify any such factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the number of years where the total leasing cost equals the buying cost, without considering the plane's life.\n\nIn that case, the break-even point is 50 years.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive, given the plane's life is only 20 years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misphrased, and it should be considering the annual cost rather than the total cost.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the break-even point in years where buying becomes more cost-effective than leasing.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that leasing is always cheaper on a per-year basis, and buying only becomes cost-effective beyond 50 years, which is beyond the plane's operational life.\n\nTherefore, based on cost alone, leasing is always more attractive.\n\nBut since the question asks for the break-even point, the answer would be 50 years.\n\nHowever, considering the plane's life is 20 years, and they would need to replace the plane every 20 years if they buy, the total cost of buying for 50 years would be $250 million (three planes at $100 million each), while leasing for 50 years would be $100 million.\n\nSo, in reality, buying is never more cost-effective, unless they operate the plane beyond its operational life without needing to replace it, which is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there is no break-even point within the plane's operational life where buying becomes more cost-effective than leasing.\n\nBut to directly answer the question, the break-even point is 50 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
