        "content": "So I've got this problem: I need to calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 8 on two six-sided dice. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that each die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. When I roll two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 times 6, which is 36. So, there are 36 possible combinations when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these combinations add up to 8. Let me list them out:\n\n- If the first die is 2, the second die needs to be 6 (2 + 6 = 8)\n\n- First die is 3, second die is 5 (3 + 5 = 8)\n\n- First die is 4, second die is 4 (4 + 4 = 8)\n\n- First die is 5, second die is 3 (5 + 3 = 8)\n\n- First die is 6, second die is 2 (6 + 2 = 8)\n\nSo, that's five combinations that give a sum of 8.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me double-check:\n\n- 2 and 6\n\n- 3 and 5\n\n- 4 and 4\n\n- 5 and 3\n\n- 6 and 2\n\nYes, that's five.\n\nNow, probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, it's 5 (favorable outcomes) divided by 36 (total possible outcomes).\n\nSo, the probability is 5/36.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any combinations. Is there any other way to get a sum of 8 with two dice? Let's see:\n\n- 1 and 7? No, dice only go up to 6.\n\n- 7 and 1? Still, not possible.\n\n- 4 and 4? Already counted.\n\n- 5 and 3? Already counted.\n\n- 6 and 2? Already counted.\n\n- 2 and 6? Already counted.\n\n- 3 and 5? Already counted.\n\nSo, no, that's all.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to consider that the order matters, so (2,6) is different from (6,2), and so on. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of partitions, but for two dice, listing them out is straightforward.\n\nSo, sticking with 5 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible ones, the probability is 5/36.\n\nLet me see if there's a formulaic way to approach this. The number of ways to get a sum 's' with two dice is the number of integer solutions to the equation d1 + d2 = s, where 1 \u2264 d1, d2 \u2264 6.\n\nFor s = 8, we can find the number of solutions:\n\nLet\u2019s set d1 = x + 1, where x \u2265 0, and d2 = y + 1, where y \u2265 0. Then, (x + 1) + (y + 1) = 8, which simplifies to x + y = 6.\n\nNow, the number of non-negative integer solutions to x + y = 6 is C(6 + 2 - 1, 2 - 1) = C(7,1) = 7.\n\nBut wait, this includes solutions where x or y might be greater than 5, which corresponds to dice showing more than 6. So, we need to subtract those invalid solutions.\n\nThe invalid solutions are those where x \u2265 6 or y \u2265 6.\n\nIf x \u2265 6, then x' = x - 6, and x' + y = 6 - 6 = 0, so x' + y = 0, which has only one solution: x' = 0, y = 0. Similarly, if y \u2265 6, we have only one solution.\n\nSo, total invalid solutions: 2.\n\nTherefore, total valid solutions: 7 - 2 = 5.\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, again, probability is 5/36.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of generating functions. The generating function for one die is g(x) = x + x\u00b2 + x\u00b3 + x\u2074 + x\u2075 + x\u2076.\n\nFor two dice, it's g(x)^2.\n\nI need the coefficient of x^8 in g(x)^2.\n\nBut that might be overkill for this simple problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but again, it's more complicated than necessary here.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach, the probability is 5/36.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the dice are indistinguishable. Does that change anything?\n\nIf the dice are indistinguishable, then (2,6) and (6,2) are considered the same, because you can't tell which die shows which number.\n\nBut in probability calculations, it's usually easier to consider the dice as distinguishable, which is what I did initially.\n\nSo, with distinguishable dice, there are 5 favorable outcomes out of 36.\n\nIf dice are indistinguishable, the total number of possible outcomes is reduced because (2,6) and (6,2) are considered the same.\n\nWait, but in that case, the total number of possible outcomes isn't 36; it's fewer.\n\nSpecifically, for two distinguishable dice, there are 6*6 = 36 outcomes.\n\nFor two indistinguishable dice, the number of distinct outcomes is C(6 + 2 - 1, 2) = C(7,2) = 21.\n\nBut in this case, using indistinguishable dice complicates things because the outcomes are not equally likely.\n\nFor example, (2,6) and (6,2) are considered one outcome if dice are indistinguishable, but in reality, there are two ways to achieve that, so it's twice as likely as (4,4), which can only happen one way.\n\nTherefore, it's better to stick with distinguishable dice for probability calculations, as it keeps all outcomes equally likely.\n\nSo, I'll stick with the probability being 5/36.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let's calculate it another way.\n\nSuppose I fix the first die. Let's say the first die shows a 2. Then, the second die needs to show a 6 to make the sum 8.\n\nSimilarly, if the first die shows 3, second needs to show 5.\n\nFirst shows 4, second shows 4.\n\nFirst shows 5, second shows 3.\n\nFirst shows 6, second shows 2.\n\nThat's five possibilities.\n\nAgain, confirming the probability is 5/36.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the second die, and fix its value, I get the same results.\n\nSo, I think it's confirmed.\n\nBut just for completeness, what's the probability of getting a sum of 7, which is a common question.\n\nThere are six ways to get a sum of 7:\n\n(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1).\n\nSo, probability is 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nWhereas for sum 8, it's 5/36.\n\nSo, sum 7 is more likely than sum 8.\n\nMakes sense, because 7 is the most likely sum in craps.\n\nWait, but in craps, the most likely sum is 7, followed by 6 and 8.\n\nYes, because they have higher number of combinations.\n\nWait, no, 7 has the highest probability.\n\n6 and 8 have lower probabilities.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSum of 6: Possible combinations are:\n\n(1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1).\n\nThat's five combinations, same as sum of 8.\n\nSum of 7: six combinations, as above.\n\nSum of 9: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3).\n\nThat's four combinations.\n\nSum of 10: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4).\n\nThree combinations.\n\nSum of 11: (5,6), (6,5).\n\nTwo combinations.\n\nSum of 12: only (6,6).\n\nOne combination.\n\nSo, indeed, sum of 7 has the highest probability, followed by sums of 6 and 8, then 5 and 9, and so on.\n\nBut back to the original question.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 8 on two six-sided dice is 5/36.\n\nTo express it as a decimal, that's approximately 0.1389, or about 13.89%.\n\nAlternatively, in percentage terms, it's about 13.89%.\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{36}} \\]"
