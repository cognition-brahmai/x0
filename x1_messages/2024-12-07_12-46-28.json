        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that's offering a 20% discount off the original price of an item, and after the discount, the price is $80. We need to find out what the original price was.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. If something is 20% off, that means you're paying 80% of the original price. Because 100% - 20% = 80%. So, the discounted price is 80% of the original price.\n\nLet's denote the original price as \"O.\" Then, the discounted price is 80% of O, which is equal to $80. So, I can write this as:\n\n0.8 * O = 80\n\nNow, to find O, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\nO = 80 / 0.8\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n80 divided by 0.8 is the same as 80 multiplied by 1.25 (since 1 divided by 0.8 is 1.25).\n\nSo, 80 * 1.25 = 100\n\nTherefore, the original price was $100.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, then the discount amount is 20% of $100, which is $20. So, $100 - $20 = $80, which matches the discounted price given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of percentages. If $80 is 80% of the original price, then to find 100%, I can set up a proportion:\n\n80% corresponds to $80\n\n100% corresponds to O\n\nSo, O = (100% / 80%) * $80 = (100/80) * 80 = 1.25 * 80 = $100\n\nAgain, that confirms that the original price was $100.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for percentage decrease:\n\nDiscounted price = Original price - (Discount rate * Original price)\n\nGiven that the discounted price is $80 and the discount rate is 20% (or 0.2), we can plug in the values:\n\n80 = O - (0.2 * O)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n80 = O - 0.2O\n\n80 = 0.8O\n\nThen, solve for O:\n\nO = 80 / 0.8 = 100\n\nOnce again, the original price is $100.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider if the discount was applied differently. For example, some stores might apply discounts based on the selling price, but in this case, it's a straightforward percentage off the original price.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the problem states that the discounted price is $80, not that the discount amount is $80. That would be a different scenario.\n\nIf the discount amount were $80, then the original price minus $80 equals the discounted price. But in this case, it's the discounted price that's $80, which is after a 20% reduction from the original price.\n\nSo, all in all, the original price was $100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
