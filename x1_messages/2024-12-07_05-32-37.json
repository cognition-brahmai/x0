        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples in bags of 6 and oranges in bags of 4. The customer buys 3 bags of apples and 2 bags of oranges. I need to find out the total number of pieces of fruit the customer has.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many apples the customer gets. Since each bag of apples has 6 apples, and the customer buys 3 bags, I can multiply 6 by 3 to get the total number of apples.\n\n6 apples/bag \u00d7 3 bags = 18 apples\n\nNext, I need to calculate the number of oranges. Each bag of oranges has 4 oranges, and the customer buys 2 bags, so I'll multiply 4 by 2.\n\n4 oranges/bag \u00d7 2 bags = 8 oranges\n\nNow, to find the total number of pieces of fruit, I'll add the number of apples and the number of oranges together.\n\n18 apples + 8 oranges = 26 pieces of fruit\n\nSo, the customer has 26 pieces of fruit in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the total number of bags and the average number of fruits per bag or something like that. Let me think.\n\nThe customer buys a total of 3 bags of apples and 2 bags of oranges, which is 5 bags in total. But the bags have different numbers of fruits, so maybe that's not the best way.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the cost, but since prices aren't mentioned, that doesn't help.\n\nOr, perhaps I could consider the ratio of apples to oranges, but again, the question is about the total number, not the ratio.\n\nNo, I think my first approach is the most straightforward and correct. Multiplying the number of bags by the number of fruits per bag for each type and then adding them together gives the total number of fruits.\n\nJust to double-check, let's do the calculations again.\n\nApples: 6 per bag \u00d7 3 bags = 18 apples\n\nOranges: 4 per bag \u00d7 2 bags = 8 oranges\n\nTotal fruits: 18 + 8 = 26\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't see any errors in this calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total number of fruits per type of bag and then sum them up. But that's essentially what I did.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of units, each unit of apple bag contributes 6 fruits, and each unit of orange bag contributes 4 fruits. So, 3 units of apple bags are 3 \u00d7 6 = 18, and 2 units of orange bags are 2 \u00d7 4 = 8. Adding them up gives 26 again.\n\nI could also visualize this. Imagine having 3 bags of apples, each with 6 apples, that's like having 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 apples. Similarly, 2 bags of oranges, each with 4 oranges, that's 4 + 4 = 8 oranges. Then, combining all the fruits, 18 apples and 8 oranges make 26 fruits in total.\n\nIs there a chance I'm missing something? Maybe considering that some fruits are being sold together in mixed bags or something, but according to the problem, apples are in bags of 6 and oranges in bags of 4, and the customer buys separate bags of each.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"pieces of fruit,\" which includes both apples and oranges, so adding them together is appropriate.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 26 pieces of fruit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]"
