        "content": "To calculate the future value of a savings account with compound interest, we can use the compound interest formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nGiven:\n\n- P = $10,000\n\n- r = 5% per annum = 0.05 (as a decimal)\n\n- n = 12 (since interest is compounded monthly)\n\n- t = 2 years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.05/12)^(12*2)\n\nFirst, calculate the monthly interest rate:\n\n0.05 / 12 = 0.0041666...\n\nThen, add 1 to this value:\n\n1 + 0.0041666... = 1.0041666...\n\nNext, raise this to the power of 24 (since 12 months * 2 years = 24):\n\n(1.0041666...)^24 \u2248 1.1049415...\n\nFinally, multiply this by the principal amount:\n\n10000 * 1.1049415... \u2248 11049.415...\n\nTherefore, after 2 years, the initial deposit of $10,000 will grow to approximately $11,049.42.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11049.42} \\]"
