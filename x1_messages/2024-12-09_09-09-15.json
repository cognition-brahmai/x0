        "content": "The term for the boundary around a black hole beyond which no light or other radiation can escape is called the \"Event Horizon.\" So, the correct answer is B. Event Horizon.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, a black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it once it crosses a certain boundary. This boundary is known as the event horizon. The event horizon is significant because it marks the point of no return; anything that crosses this boundary is inevitably pulled into the black hole.\n\nThe other options are not related to this specific concept:\n\n- A nebula is a cloud of dust and gas in space, often a site where stars are born.\n\n- Red shift is a phenomenon where light from an object is shifted to longer wavelengths, often used to determine how fast an object is moving away from us.\n\n- A white dwarf is a small, dense star that is the remnant of a star like our Sun at the end of its life.\n\nSo, in the context of your question, the event horizon is the correct term for the boundary around a black hole from which no escape is possible."
