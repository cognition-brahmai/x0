        "content": "Let's see. So, the problem is: if it takes 5 machines 10 hours to produce 50 items, how long will it take 10 machines to produce 100 items?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of machines, the time they work, and the number of items they produce. It seems like a problem involving proportionality.\n\nLet me start by finding out the production rate of one machine. If 5 machines take 10 hours to produce 50 items, then the total production is 50 items in 10 hours by 5 machines.\n\nSo, the production per machine per hour would be:\n\nProduction per machine per hour = Total items / (Number of machines * Number of hours)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nProduction per machine per hour = 50 / (5 * 10) = 50 / 50 = 1 item per hour.\n\nAlright, so each machine produces 1 item per hour.\n\nNow, if I have 10 machines, and each produces 1 item per hour, then together they produce 10 items per hour.\n\nThe goal is to produce 100 items.\n\nSo, time required = Total items needed / Production rate of all machines.\n\nTime required = 100 / 10 = 10 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using the concept of man-hours or machine-hours.\n\nIn the first scenario, 5 machines working for 10 hours produce 50 items.\n\nSo, total machine-hours = 5 machines * 10 hours = 50 machine-hours.\n\nAnd this produces 50 items.\n\nSo, the production rate is 50 items per 50 machine-hours, which simplifies to 1 item per machine-hour.\n\nNow, if I have 10 machines, and each machine-hour produces 1 item, then in t hours, the total production would be:\n\nTotal production = Number of machines * Number of hours * Production rate per machine-hour.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n100 = 10 * t * 1.\n\nSo, 100 = 10t.\n\nTherefore, t = 100 / 10 = 10 hours.\n\nOkay, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider? For example, does the production rate change with more machines? Is there a diminishing return or any constraints that might affect the production time?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any such complications, so I'll assume that each machine works independently and produces at the same rate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see that the number of machines and the number of items both double from the first scenario to the second.\n\nInitially, 5 machines produce 50 items in 10 hours.\n\nNow, 10 machines should produce 100 items in the same time, because both the number of machines and the number of items have doubled.\n\nThis also suggests that the time remains the same at 10 hours.\n\nWait a minute, but if I double the number of machines, they can produce double the items in the same time, assuming each machine works at the same rate.\n\nSo, yes, 10 machines should be able to produce 100 items in 10 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there's a general formula for this type of problem.\n\nSuppose m1 machines take t1 hours to produce p1 items.\n\nWe need to find t2 hours for m2 machines to produce p2 items.\n\nAssuming the production rate per machine is constant, we can set up a proportion.\n\nFirst, find the production rate per machine per hour.\n\nProduction rate per machine per hour = p1 / (m1 * t1)\n\nThen, for m2 machines to produce p2 items, the time required t2 would be:\n\nt2 = p2 / (m2 * production rate per machine per hour)\n\nSubstituting the production rate:\n\nt2 = p2 / (m2 * (p1 / (m1 * t1)))\n\nSimplify this:\n\nt2 = p2 * m1 * t1 / (m2 * p1)\n\nSo, t2 = (p2 * m1 * t1) / (m2 * p1)\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nm1 = 5, t1 = 10, p1 = 50, m2 = 10, p2 = 100.\n\nt2 = (100 * 5 * 10) / (10 * 50) = (5000) / (500) = 10 hours.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nIs there any chance that the time could be different? For example, if there are constraints on the production line or if machines interfere with each other, but the problem doesn't suggest any such issues.\n\nTherefore, it seems safe to conclude that it will take 10 hours for 10 machines to produce 100 items.\n\nWait, but let's think about it in terms of total machine-hours needed to produce the items.\n\nFrom the first scenario, 5 machines * 10 hours = 50 machine-hours to produce 50 items.\n\nSo, the machine-hours per item is 50 / 50 = 1 machine-hour per item.\n\nTherefore, to produce 100 items, we need 100 machine-hours.\n\nIf we have 10 machines working simultaneously, the time required is total machine-hours needed divided by the number of machines.\n\nSo, t = 100 / 10 = 10 hours.\n\nYet another confirmation of the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear now. The answer should be 10 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
