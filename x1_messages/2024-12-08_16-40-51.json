        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 8 green balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacing the first one, both balls are the same color. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. I can get that by adding up the red, blue, and green balls:\n\nTotal balls = 5 red + 7 blue + 8 green = 20 balls.\n\nNow, the probability that both balls are the same color can be found by considering the probabilities of each possible scenario where both balls are red, both are blue, or both are green, and then adding those probabilities together.\n\nSo, the total probability P(same color) = P(both red) + P(both blue) + P(both green).\n\nLet's start by finding P(both red).\n\nTo find P(both red), I need to find the probability of picking a red ball first and then another red ball second, without replacement.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is:\n\nP(first red) = number of red balls / total balls = 5/20 = 1/4.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls left is 19, and the number of red balls left is 4.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is:\n\nP(second red | first red) = 4/19.\n\nTherefore, P(both red) = P(first red) * P(second red | first red) = (1/4) * (4/19) = 1/19.\n\nNext, P(both blue).\n\nSimilarly, P(first blue) = 7/20.\n\nAfter picking one blue ball, there are 6 blue balls left and total balls left are 19.\n\nSo, P(second blue | first blue) = 6/19.\n\nTherefore, P(both blue) = (7/20) * (6/19) = (7*6)/(20*19) = 42/380 = 21/190.\n\nNow, P(both green).\n\nP(first green) = 8/20 = 2/5.\n\nAfter picking one green ball, there are 7 green balls left and total balls left are 19.\n\nSo, P(second green | first green) = 7/19.\n\nTherefore, P(both green) = (2/5) * (7/19) = (2*7)/(5*19) = 14/95.\n\nNow, to find the total probability P(same color), I add up these probabilities:\n\nP(same color) = P(both red) + P(both blue) + P(both green) = 1/19 + 21/190 + 14/95.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 19, 190, and 95.\n\n19 is a prime number, 190 is 19*10, and 95 is 19*5. So, the LCM should be 19*10 = 190.\n\nNow, convert each fraction to have a denominator of 190.\n\n1/19 = (1*10)/(19*10) = 10/190.\n\n21/190 remains as it is.\n\n14/95 = (14*2)/(95*2) = 28/190.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\nP(same color) = 10/190 + 21/190 + 28/190 = (10 + 21 + 28)/190 = 59/190.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are the same color is 59/190.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that addition: 10 + 21 is 31, plus 28 is 59. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 20 is C(20,2), which is (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls is C(5,2) = (5*4)/2 = 10.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 blue balls is C(7,2) = (7*6)/2 = 21.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 green balls is C(8,2) = (8*7)/2 = 28.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 + 21 + 28 = 59.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 59/190, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{59}{190}} \\]"
