        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the national postal service wants to switch some of their delivery vehicles to electric ones. They have a big fleet of 10,000 gasoline-powered vehicles, each averaging 15 miles per gallon. The electric replacements cost $35,000 each, and they've got a budget of $200 million for this project.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many electric vehicles they can afford with that budget. To do that, I'll divide the total budget by the cost per electric vehicle.\n\nBudget: $200,000,000\n\nCost per electric vehicle: $35,000\n\nNumber of vehicles they can replace = Budget / Cost per electric vehicle\n\nSo, $200,000,000 / $35,000 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n200,000,000 divided by 35,000. Hmm, 35,000 times 5,714 is 200,000,000. Wait, let me do it properly.\n\nActually, 35,000 times 5,714 is 199,990,000, which is very close to 200,000,000. So, they can replace approximately 5,714 vehicles with electric models within their budget.\n\nBut to be precise, let's see how much 5,714 vehicles would cost:\n\n5,714 * 35,000 = 199,990,000\n\nSo, they have $200,000,000 - $199,990,000 = $10,000 left, which isn't enough for another vehicle since each costs $35,000. So, they can replace 5,714 vehicles.\n\nNow, the next part is to calculate the potential reduction in fuel consumption based on this investment.\n\nEach gasoline-powered vehicle averages 15 miles per gallon. But to calculate fuel savings, I need to know how much fuel they currently consume and how much they would consume with electric vehicles.\n\nWait, electric vehicles don't consume gasoline; they consume electricity. So, the fuel consumption from gasoline would be eliminated for the vehicles that are replaced.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for the reduction in gasoline consumption.\n\nAssuming that's the case, I need to find out how much gasoline the 5,714 vehicles would have consumed per year if they were still gasoline-powered, and since they're being replaced with electric vehicles, that consumption would be saved.\n\nBut I need to know the annual mileage of each vehicle to calculate the total gasoline consumption.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the annual mileage per vehicle. Without that information, I can't calculate the exact reduction in fuel consumption.\n\nMaybe I should assume an average annual mileage for delivery vehicles. Let's say, for example, that each vehicle drives 20,000 miles per year. This is just an assumption since the problem doesn't provide this data.\n\nSo, if each vehicle drives 20,000 miles per year and gets 15 miles per gallon, then the annual gasoline consumption per vehicle is:\n\n20,000 miles / 15 mpg = 1,333.33 gallons per year.\n\nThen, for 5,714 vehicles, the total annual gasoline savings would be:\n\n5,714 vehicles * 1,333.33 gallons per vehicle = 7,618,888.89 gallons per year.\n\nThat's a significant reduction.\n\nBut since I had to assume the annual mileage, perhaps there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the reduction in fuel consumption to be expressed in terms of miles per gallon saved, or some other metric.\n\nWait, perhaps it's expecting the potential reduction in fuel consumption based on the number of vehicles replaced, assuming each replaced vehicle no longer consumes gasoline.\n\nIn that case, the reduction would be equivalent to the fuel consumption of 5,714 vehicles.\n\nBut without the annual mileage, it's hard to give a concrete number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the potential reduction in fuel costs, but that would require knowing the price per gallon of gasoline.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide the annual mileage or the cost of gasoline, perhaps the expected answer is just the number of vehicles that can be replaced, which is 5,714, and a statement that the reduction in fuel consumption would be equivalent to the fuel used by those 5,714 vehicles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the fuel savings in terms of miles per gallon saved per vehicle replaced.\n\nBut that seems a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the reduction in fuel consumption based on the proportion of vehicles replaced.\n\nTotal fleet: 10,000 vehicles\n\nVehicles replaced: 5,714 vehicles\n\nSo, the proportion of the fleet being replaced is 5,714 / 10,000 = 0.5714, or 57.14%.\n\nTherefore, the potential reduction in fuel consumption would be 57.14% of the total current fuel consumption.\n\nBut again, without knowing the total current fuel consumption, this is just a proportion.\n\nPerhaps the expected answer is that by replacing 57.14% of the fleet with electric vehicles, they can reduce their gasoline consumption by 57.14%.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that electric vehicles have zero gasoline consumption, then the reduction in fuel consumption is equal to the fuel consumption of the replaced vehicles.\n\nSo, if they replace 5,714 vehicles, the reduction in fuel consumption is equal to the fuel that these 5,714 vehicles would have consumed if they were still gasoline-powered.\n\nBut without the annual mileage, I can't calculate the exact gallons saved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can calculate the total cost savings in fuel over the lifetime of the electric vehicles, but again, that would require knowing the lifetime of the vehicles, the annual mileage, and the cost of gasoline.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that the main calculation is determining how many vehicles can be replaced with the given budget, which is 5,714 vehicles.\n\nAs for the potential reduction in fuel consumption, without additional data such as annual mileage per vehicle or the cost of gasoline, I can only say that replacing 5,714 vehicles with electric models would eliminate the gasoline consumption of those vehicles, leading to a reduction in fuel consumption proportional to the number of vehicles replaced.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Number of vehicles that can be replaced: 5,714\n\n- Potential reduction in fuel consumption: equivalent to the gasoline consumption of 5,714 vehicles, which depends on their annual mileage and fuel efficiency.\n\nTo provide a more concrete number for fuel savings, additional information would be needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5714 \\text{ vehicles can be replaced, leading to a reduction in fuel consumption equivalent to that of 5714 gasoline-powered vehicles.}} \\]"
