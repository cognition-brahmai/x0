        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains moving towards each other: one from City A to City B at 60 mph and the other from City B to City A at 40 mph. The distance between the cities is 200 miles. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph. This means that together, they are closing the distance between them at a rate of 100 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance they need to cover before they meet is 200 miles. If they are closing in at 100 miles per hour, then the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by their relative speed.\n\nSo, time = distance / speed = 200 miles / 100 mph = 2 hours.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If one train is going at 60 mph and the other at 40 mph, and they're moving towards each other, yes, their relative speed is indeed the sum of their speeds, which is 100 mph.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how far each train travels in a certain amount of time and set up an equation where the sum of the distances equals 200 miles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train travels 60t miles.\n\nIn the same t hours, the second train travels 40t miles.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of the distances they've traveled should be equal to the total distance between the cities, which is 200 miles.\n\nSo, 60t + 40t = 200.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 100t = 200.\n\nSolving for t, t = 200 / 100 = 2 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the concept of relative speed. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, again, 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph.\n\nThen, time = distance / relative speed = 200 miles / 100 mph = 2 hours.\n\nEverything points to the same answer: it will take 2 hours for the trains to meet.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are the trains accelerating or decelerating? The problem doesn't mention any changes in speed, so I can assume they're moving at constant speeds.\n\nAlso, the track is presumably straight and connects the two cities directly, so no need to consider any curves or additional distances.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the starting times. The problem says \"at the same time,\" so both trains start moving towards each other at the same moment.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
