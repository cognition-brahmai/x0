        "content": "So the factory makes 5000 widgets every day, and each widget weighs 200 grams. I need to find out how many kilograms of widgets are produced in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total weight of widgets produced each day. Since each widget weighs 200 grams, and there are 5000 of them, I can multiply those two numbers to get the daily production in grams.\n\nSo, 5000 widgets * 200 grams/widget = 1,000,000 grams per day.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check that again. 5000 times 200 is indeed 1,000,000 grams per day.\n\nNow, I need to convert grams to kilograms because the question asks for the answer in kilograms. I know that 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams. So, to convert grams to kilograms, I divide by 1000.\n\nSo, 1,000,000 grams / 1000 = 1000 kilograms per day.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, to find out the weekly production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, 1000 kilograms/day * 7 days/week = 7000 kilograms per week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 5000 widgets per day, each weighing 200 grams:\n\n5000 * 200 = 1,000,000 grams per day.\n\nThen, 1,000,000 grams / 1000 = 1000 kilograms per day.\n\nAnd 1000 kilograms/day * 7 days = 7000 kilograms per week.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total widgets produced in a week and then calculate the weight.\n\nNumber of widgets per week: 5000 widgets/day * 7 days = 35,000 widgets per week.\n\nThen, total weight: 35,000 widgets * 200 grams/widget = 7,000,000 grams.\n\nConvert to kilograms: 7,000,000 grams / 1000 = 7000 kilograms.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think 7000 kilograms is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7000} \\]"
