        "content": "So I've got this problem here about marbles in a jar, and I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue marble. Let's see, there are 8 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 10 green marbles. First things first, I need to know the total number of marbles in the jar. So, I'll add up all the marbles: 8 red plus 6 blue plus 10 green equals 24 marbles in total.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue marble. So, I need to find out how many marbles are either red or blue. There are 8 red and 6 blue, so that's 8 plus 6 equals 14 marbles that are either red or blue.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking either a red or a blue marble should be 14 (the number of red and blue marbles) divided by 24 (the total number of marbles). So, that's 14/24.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. Both 14 and 24 can be divided by 2. So, 14 divided by 2 is 7, and 24 divided by 2 is 12. So, the simplified fraction is 7/12.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the probability addition rule or something like that. Let's see, the probability of picking a red marble is 8/24, and the probability of picking a blue marble is 6/24. So, if I add those probabilities together, it should give me the probability of picking either red or blue.\n\nSo, probability of red is 8/24, probability of blue is 6/24, and since these are mutually exclusive events (you can't pick both at the same time), I can just add them up. So, 8/24 plus 6/24 equals 14/24, which again simplifies to 7/12.\n\nHmm, that matches what I got earlier. So, that seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the probability of picking a green marble. There are 10 green marbles out of 24 total, so that's 10/24, which simplifies to 5/12. If I add the probability of picking red or blue (7/12) and the probability of picking green (5/12), it should equal 1, since those are the only colors available. And indeed, 7/12 plus 5/12 equals 12/12, which is 1. So, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the probability of picking red or blue is equal to 1 minus the probability of picking green. Since the only other option is green, that makes sense. So, 1 minus 5/12 is 7/12, which again matches what I've got.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The probability of picking either a red or a blue marble is 7/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{12}} \\]"
