        "content": "So in this problem, there's a class of 40 students, and 75% of them passed the final exam. First, I need to find out how many students passed.\n\nSo, 75% of 40 students passed. To find that, I can calculate 75% of 40.\n\n75% of 40 is (75/100) * 40 = 0.75 * 40 = 30 students passed.\n\nNow, of those who passed, 60% got an A or B. So, out of the 30 students who passed, 60% of them got an A or B.\n\nSo, 60% of 30 is (60/100) * 30 = 0.6 * 30 = 18 students got an A or B.\n\nNow, the question is asking for how many students received a C or lower but still passed the exam.\n\nSo, those are the students who passed but did not get an A or B, meaning they got a C or lower.\n\nSince 30 students passed, and 18 of them got an A or B, then the remaining students who passed must have got a C or lower.\n\nSo, 30 - 18 = 12 students received a C or lower but still passed the exam.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal students: 40\n\nPassed: 75% of 40 = 30 students\n\nGot A or B: 60% of those who passed = 18 students\n\nTherefore, students who passed with C or lower: 30 - 18 = 12 students.\n\nYeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nIs there any other interpretation of the problem?\n\nWell, sometimes these problems can have trick elements, but I don't think so in this case.\n\nIt's pretty direct:\n\n- Find the number who passed: 75% of 40.\n\n- Find the number who got A or B: 60% of those who passed.\n\n- Subtract the A or B students from the total who passed to find those who got C or lower but still passed.\n\nSo, the answer should be 12 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
