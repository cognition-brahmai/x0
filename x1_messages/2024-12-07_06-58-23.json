        "content": "Ah, you're referring to the infamous pirate, Blackbeard! His real name was Edward Teach, and he operated in the Caribbean and along the eastern coast of British North America during the early 18th century, a period often referred to as the Golden Age of Piracy.\n\nBlackbeard commanded several vessels during his pirating career, but the one he's most famous for is the Queen Anne's Revenge. This ship was originally a French slave ship called La Concorde de Nantes. Blackbeard and his crew captured it in 1717 and renamed it Queen Anne's Revenge.\n\nUnder Blackbeard's command, the Queen Anne's Revenge was heavily armed, carrying around 40 guns, which made it a formidable vessel. Blackbeard used this ship to blockade Charleston Harbor in South Carolina in 1718, holding the city ransom for medicine and other goods.\n\nUnfortunately, the Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground in 1718 near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina. Blackbeard abandoned the ship and continued his pirating activities with a smaller vessel, the Adventure.\n\nToday, the wreckage of the Queen Anne's Revenge is being excavated and studied by marine archaeologists, providing valuable insights into life during the Golden Age of Piracy.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the famous ship captained by Blackbeard was the Queen Anne's Revenge."
