Then, I put back 2 apples, so now the basket has 5 + 2 = 7 apples.\n\nNow, I need to have a total of 12 apples in the basket. So, if there are currently 7 apples, how many more do I need to add to make it 12?\n\nWell, 12 - 7 = 5 apples.\n\nSo, I need to add 5 apples to the basket to have a total of 12 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting with 8 apples, take away 3, that's 8 - 3 = 5 apples.\n\nThen put back 2, so 5 + 2 = 7 apples.\n\nTo get to 12, I need to add 12 - 7 = 5 apples.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
