        "content": "Let's see. If someone saves 5% of their $4,000 monthly income, that means they're putting away $4,000 times 5%, right? So, first, I need to calculate what 5% of $4,000 is.\n\n5% of $4,000 is calculated as 0.05 multiplied by 4000, which equals $200. So, they save $200 each month.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much they'll have saved after 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be 2 times 12, which is 24 months.\n\nSo, if they save $200 each month for 24 months, the total savings would be $200 multiplied by 24.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 200 times 24.\n\n200 times 20 is 4,000, and 200 times 4 is 800. Adding those together, 4,000 plus 800 equals $4,800.\n\nTherefore, after 2 years, they would have saved $4,800.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Like, maybe interest if the money is in a savings account? The question doesn't mention anything about interest, so maybe it's assume there's no interest earned on the savings.\n\nSo, based on just saving a fixed percentage each month without any interest, the total after 2 years would be $4,800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4800} \\]"
