        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 6 defective items and 14 non-defective items, making a total of 20 items. I need to find the probability that if I randomly select 3 items, exactly 2 of them will be defective.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember how to approach probability problems, especially those involving combinations since the selection is random.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to use combinations because the order in which I select the items doesn't matter. It's about the combination of items I end up with.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select 3 items out of 20 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 20 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\), so the total number of ways to choose 3 items from 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20!}{3!(20 - 3)!} = \\frac{20!}{3! \\cdot 17!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 17! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17!}{3! \\times 17!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{3!}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( 3! = 6 \\), then:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{6} = \\frac{6840}{6} = 1140\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 1,140 possible ways to choose any 3 items from the box.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to select exactly 2 defective items and 1 non-defective item.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to choose 2 defective items from the 6 defective ones.\n\nUsing the combination formula again:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2! \\cdot 4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 4!} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to choose 2 defective items.\n\nNext, I need to choose 1 non-defective item from the 14 non-defective ones.\n\n\\[\nC(14, 1) = \\frac{14!}{1!(14 - 1)!} = \\frac{14!}{1! \\cdot 13!} = \\frac{14 \\times 13!}{1 \\times 13!} = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 14 ways to choose 1 non-defective item.\n\nNow, since these are independent choices (choosing defective and non-defective items), I need to multiply the number of ways to choose the defective items by the number of ways to choose the non-defective items to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable outcomes} = C(6, 2) \\times C(14, 1) = 15 \\times 14 = 210\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 210 favorable ways to select exactly 2 defective items and 1 non-defective item.\n\nFinally, to find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 2 defective}) = \\frac{\\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{210}{1140}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 30.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{210 \\div 30}{1140 \\div 30} = \\frac{7}{38}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{7}{38} \\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nFirst, confirming the total number of ways to choose 3 items from 20:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 3) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{6840}{6} = 1140\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, the number of ways to choose 2 defective items from 6:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = 15\n\\]\n\nAnd 1 non-defective from 14:\n\n\\[\nC(14, 1) = 14\n\\]\n\nMultiplying them gives 210 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, probability is \\( \\frac{210}{1140} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{7}{38} \\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of permutations if I prefer, but since the order doesn't matter, combinations are the way to go.\n\nAnother way to approach this is using the hypergeometric distribution formula, which is used for sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (20 items),\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (6 defective items),\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (3 items),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (2 defective items).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\frac{C(6, 2) \\times C(14, 1)}{C(20, 3)} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{1140} = \\frac{210}{1140} = \\frac{7}{38}\n\\]\n\nSo, again, I get \\( \\frac{7}{38} \\).\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can calculate it another way, like using probabilities step by step.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting exactly 2 defective items out of 3 selections.\n\nFirst, the probability of selecting 2 defective items and 1 non-defective item can occur in different orders:\n\n1. Defective, Defective, Non-defective\n\n2. Defective, Non-defective, Defective\n\n3. Non-defective, Defective, Defective\n\nSo, there are 3 different sequences.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for one sequence and then multiply by 3.\n\nTake the first sequence: Defective, Defective, Non-defective.\n\nThe probability of selecting a defective item first is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{20}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that one defective item is already selected, the probability of selecting another defective item is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{19}\n\\]\n\nFinally, the probability of selecting a non-defective item is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{18}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{20} \\times \\frac{5}{19} \\times \\frac{14}{18}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, \\( \\frac{6}{20} = 0.3 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 0.3 \\times \\frac{5}{19} = 0.3 \\times 0.2631578947 \\approx 0.0789473684 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 0.0789473684 \\times \\frac{14}{18} = 0.0789473684 \\times 0.7777777778 \\approx 0.0612244898 \\)\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is approximately 0.0612.\n\nBut to be precise, let's keep it as a fraction.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{20} \\times \\frac{5}{19} \\times \\frac{14}{18} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 14}{20 \\times 19 \\times 18} = \\frac{420}{6840} = \\frac{7}{114}\n\\]\n\nNow, since there are 3 such sequences, the total probability is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{7}{114} = \\frac{21}{114} = \\frac{7}{38}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get \\( \\frac{7}{38} \\).\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting exactly 2 defective items out of 3 is \\( \\frac{7}{38} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{38}} \\]"
