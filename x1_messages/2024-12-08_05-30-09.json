        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a bag of marbles, 25% are red. There are 80 marbles in total, and I need to find out how many are not red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that 25% of the marbles are red. So, to find out how many marbles are red, I can calculate 25% of 80. The way to calculate a percentage of a number is to multiply the percentage by the total number, but I need to convert the percentage into a decimal first. 25% as a decimal is 0.25. So, red marbles = 0.25 \u00d7 80.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 0.25 \u00d7 80. Well, 0.25 times 80 is 20. So, there are 20 red marbles.\n\nNow, the total number of marbles is 80, and out of those, 20 are red. To find out how many are not red, I can subtract the number of red marbles from the total number of marbles. So, non-red marbles = total marbles - red marbles = 80 - 20.\n\nThat gives me 60 marbles that are not red.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of finding the red marbles first and then subtracting, I could directly find the percentage of marbles that are not red and then calculate that percentage of the total.\n\nLet's try that. If 25% are red, then the percentage that is not red is 100% - 25% = 75%. So, 75% of the marbles are not red. Now, to find 75% of 80, I convert 75% to a decimal, which is 0.75, and then multiply by 80.\n\nSo, non-red marbles = 0.75 \u00d7 80.\n\nLet's do the multiplication: 0.75 \u00d7 80. That's 60.\n\nSo, again, I get 60 marbles that are not red.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 60 is the correct number of non-red marbles.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check another way. Let's think about fractions. 25% is the same as 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4. So, one-fourth of the marbles are red. Since there are 80 marbles, one-fourth of 80 is 20, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, if one-fourth are red, then the remaining three-fourths are not red. So, three-fourths of 80 is 3/4 \u00d7 80. That's (3 \u00d7 80)/4 = 240/4 = 60.\n\nAgain, 60 marbles are not red.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
