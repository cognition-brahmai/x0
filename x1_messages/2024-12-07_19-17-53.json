I'm really sorry about this; I value our sessions and the work we're doing together.\n\nThe reason for my absence is that Professor McGonagall has asked me to help her with something urgently. It seems there's a bit of a mishap in the Transfiguration department, and she needs an extra pair of hands to sort things out. As you can imagine, I couldn't say no to a request from Professor McGonagall, especially when it involves helping out with such an important matter.\n\nI've tried to reschedule, but the timing just doesn't work out. The task requires immediate attention, and I don't want to delay it any further. I promise to catch up on what I miss in the meeting as soon as possible. Perhaps someone could fill me in afterward or maybe even take notes for me?\n\nPlease don't let my absence disrupt your plans. I have every faith in your abilities to lead and organize the meeting effectively. Keep up the great work, and I'll see you all at the next session.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nHermione Granger\n"
