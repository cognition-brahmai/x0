It was indeed signed in 1215 and is considered a foundational document in the history of constitutional law. The Magna Carta limited the power of the English monarch, particularly King John, and established the principle that everyone, including the king, is subject to the law. This document has had a profound influence on the development of legal systems around the world, including the United States."
