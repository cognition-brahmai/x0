        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that reads numbers from a text file, calculates their mean and standard deviation, and then prints those values. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to think about how the text file is structured. The prompt says it contains a list of numbers, one per line. So, I can assume that the file has something like:\n\n```\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n```\n\nEach number is on its own line, and they're all integers in this example, but I should consider whether they could be floating-point numbers as well. To be safe, I'll read them as floats, which can handle both integers and decimals.\n\nNow, I need to read these numbers from the file. In Python, reading from a file involves opening it, reading its contents, and then closing it properly. With the `with` statement, I can open the file and ensure it gets closed after I'm done, even if an error occurs.\n\nSo, the basic structure would be:\n\n```python\n\nwith open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n\n    # read the numbers here\n\n```\n\nI need to read each line, strip any extra whitespace or newline characters, and convert them to floats. I can use a list comprehension for that.\n\nLike this:\n\n```python\n\nwith open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n\n    numbers = [float(line.strip()) for line in file.readlines()]\n\n```\n\nBut, I should also handle possible errors, such as the file not existing or having non-numeric values in it. For now, I'll keep it simple and assume the file is correctly formatted. But in a real-world scenario, I should add error handling.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the mean of these numbers. The mean is just the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. In Python, I can use the built-in `sum()` function and `len()` function to get the sum and the count, respectively.\n\nSo, the mean can be calculated as:\n\n```python\n\nmean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n```\n\nAfter that, I need to calculate the standard deviation. Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in the set of values. The formula for the sample standard deviation is:\n\n```\n\nsqrt(sum((x - mean)^2) / (n - 1))\n\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n- x represents each number in the dataset\n\n- mean is the mean of the numbers\n\n- n is the count of numbers\n\nIn Python, I can calculate this by:\n\n1. Subtracting the mean from each number and squaring the result.\n\n2. Summing up these squared differences.\n\n3. Dividing by (n - 1).\n\n4. Taking the square root of the result.\n\nI can use a list comprehension to calculate the squared differences:\n\n```python\n\nsquared_diff = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]\n\n```\n\nThen, sum them up:\n\n```python\n\nsum_squared_diff = sum(squared_diff)\n\n```\n\nThen, divide by (n - 1):\n\n```python\n\nvariance = sum_squared_diff / (len(numbers) - 1)\n\n```\n\nAnd finally, take the square root to get the standard deviation:\n\n```python\n\nimport math\n\nstd_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\n\n```\n\nI need to make sure to handle the case where there's only one number in the list, which would make (n - 1) zero, leading to a division by zero error. But since the prompt says it's a list of numbers, I'll assume there's more than one.\n\nPutting it all together, the script would look like this:\n\n```python\n\n# Read numbers from file\n\nwith open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n\n    numbers = [float(line.strip()) for line in file.readlines()]\n\n# Calculate mean\n\nmean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n# Calculate standard deviation\n\nsquared_diff = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]\n\nsum_squared_diff = sum(squared_diff)\n\nvariance = sum_squared_diff / (len(numbers) - 1)\n\nimport math\n\nstd_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\n\n# Print results\n\nprint(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n\nprint(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\n```\n\nI should test this script with a sample file to make sure it works. For example, create a file named \"numbers.txt\" with the following content:\n\n```\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n```\n\nRunning the script should calculate the mean and standard deviation correctly.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to format the output to have a certain number of decimal places. For example, to print the mean and standard deviation with two decimal places:\n\n```python\n\nprint(f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n\nprint(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}\")\n\n```\n\nThis makes the output cleaner and more readable.\n\nAlso, as a good practice, I should handle potential errors, such as the file not existing or having non-numeric values. I can do this using try-except blocks.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n\ntry:\n\n    with open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n\n        numbers = [float(line.strip()) for line in file.readlines()]\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\n    print(\"The file was not found. Please check the filename and try again.\")\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\n    print(\"The file contains non-numeric values.\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # Calculate mean and standard deviation as before\n\n    # ...\n\n    # Print results\n\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}\")\n\n```\n\nThis way, if there's an issue with the file, the script won't crash and will inform the user about the problem.\n\nMoreover, I should consider if the file might contain empty lines or lines with only whitespace. To handle that, I can add a condition to skip such lines.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n\nnumbers = []\n\nwith open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n\n    for line in file:\n\n        line = line.strip()\n\n        if line:\n\n            numbers.append(float(line))\n\n```\n\nThis way, only non-empty lines are considered.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that there are at least two numbers in the list when calculating the standard deviation to avoid division by zero. If there's only one number, the standard deviation is undefined.\n\nI can add a check for that:\n\n```python\n\nif len(numbers) < 2:\n\n    print(\"At least two numbers are required to calculate standard deviation.\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # Calculate mean and standard deviation\n\n    # ...\n\n    # Print results\n\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}\")\n\n```\n\nThis makes the script more robust.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the population standard deviation formula, which divides by n instead of n-1, but the sample standard deviation (dividing by n-1) is more commonly used when working with a sample of a population.\n\nAnother optimization is to calculate the sum and sum of squares in a single pass, which can be more efficient and accurate numerically. However, for simplicity, the current approach is fine.\n\nAdditionally, I could use external libraries like NumPy, which have built-in functions for mean and standard deviation. But since the task is to create a Python script from scratch, I'll stick with built-in functions.\n\nSo, the final script with error handling and considerations for edge cases would look like this:\n\n```python\n\ntry:\n\n    numbers = []\n\n    with open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n\n        for line in file:\n\n            line = line.strip()\n\n            if line:\n\n                numbers.append(float(line))\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\n    print(\"The file was not found. Please check the filename and try again.\")\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\n    print(\"The file contains non-numeric values.\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n\n        print(\"At least two numbers are required to calculate standard deviation.\")\n\n    else:\n\n        # Calculate mean\n\n        mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n        # Calculate standard deviation\n\n        squared_diff = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]\n\n        sum_squared_diff = sum(squared_diff)\n\n        variance = sum_squared_diff / (len(numbers) - 1)\n\n        import math\n\n        std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\n\n        # Print results\n\n        print(f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n\n        print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}\")\n\n```\n\nThis script should accomplish the task as described in the prompt.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python script that reads a list of numbers from a text file, calculates their mean and standard deviation, and prints the results. The text file contains numbers, each on a separate line.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading the File**: We read the numbers from the file, handling possible errors such as the file not existing or containing non-numeric values.\n2. **Calculating the Mean**: The mean is calculated by summing all numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n3. **Calculating the Standard Deviation**: We use the sample standard deviation formula, which involves calculating the squared differences from the mean, summing them up, dividing by (n-1), and taking the square root.\n4. **Error Handling**: We handle cases where the file might not be found, contains non-numeric values, or has insufficient data to calculate standard deviation.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ntry:\n    numbers = []\n    with open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            line = line.strip()\n            if line:\n                numbers.append(float(line))\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"The file was not found. Please check the filename and try again.\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"The file contains non-numeric values.\")\nelse:\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        print(\"At least two numbers are required to calculate standard deviation.\")\n    else:\n        # Calculate mean\n        mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n        \n        # Calculate standard deviation\n        squared_diff = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]\n        sum_squared_diff = sum(squared_diff)\n        variance = sum_squared_diff / (len(numbers) - 1)\n        import math\n        std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\n        \n        # Print results\n        print(f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the File**: We open the file using a `with` statement to ensure it gets closed after reading. We read each line, strip any extraneous whitespace, and convert the line to a float, appending it to our list of numbers.\n2. **Mean Calculation**: The mean is computed by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of numbers.\n3. **Standard Deviation Calculation**: We first compute the squared differences from the mean for each number, sum these squared differences, divide by (n-1) to get the variance, and finally take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n4. **Error Handling**: We use try-except blocks to handle cases where the file does not exist or contains invalid data. We also check if there are at least two numbers to compute the standard deviation, as it requires at least two data points."
