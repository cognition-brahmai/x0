You mentioned that the factory produces 10 cars every day, and on Monday, it produced 5 red cars, 3 blue cars, and 2 green cars. But your question is about the majority color of cars produced on Tuesday. Since you only provided information about Monday's production, I don't have data for Tuesday yet. Could you please provide the numbers for Tuesday's production?"
