        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two different products: product A and product B. The production rates are different for each, and we need to find out how many units of both are produced in one week.\n\nFirst, let's understand the production rates:\n\n- Product A: 500 units per hour\n\n- Product B: 300 units every two hours\n\nAlright, so for product A, it's straightforward. It produces 500 units every hour. For product B, it's a bit different because it produces 300 units every two hours. So, to make it easier, maybe we can find out the hourly production rate for product B.\n\nLet's calculate the hourly production rate for product B:\n\nIf product B produces 300 units every two hours, then per hour, it would be 300 units divided by 2 hours, which is 150 units per hour.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n- Product A: 500 units/hour\n\n- Product B: 150 units/hour\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours there are in one week. There are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, so:\n\n24 hours/day * 7 days/week = 168 hours/week\n\nNow, we can calculate the total production for each product in one week.\n\nFor product A:\n\n500 units/hour * 168 hours/week = 84,000 units/week\n\nFor product B:\n\n150 units/hour * 168 hours/week = 25,200 units/week\n\nFinally, to find the total units of both products produced in one week, we add the two together:\n\n84,000 units (product A) + 25,200 units (product B) = 109,200 units\n\nSo, the factory produces a total of 109,200 units of both products in one week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the production rates:\n\n- Product A: 500 units/hour\n\n- Product B: 300 units every two hours, which is indeed 150 units/hour\n\nTotal production per hour for both products:\n\n500 (A) + 150 (B) = 650 units/hour\n\nNow, over 168 hours in a week:\n\n650 units/hour * 168 hours/week = 109,200 units/week\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the total units for each product separately and then add them up, as I did earlier, and that also gives the same total of 109,200 units.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 109,200 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{109200} \\]"
