        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to write a Golang application that processes a large dataset, like log files, and calculates the frequency of each unique word. Then, it should output the top 10 most frequent words. And it has to do this concurrently using goroutines and channels. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what concurrent programming means in Go. Goroutines are functions that can run concurrently with other functions. Channels are the pipes that connect goroutines, allowing them to communicate by passing values of a specified type. So, I'll need to set up goroutines to process parts of the dataset and use channels to collect the results.\n\nNow, processing large datasets efficiently is crucial, especially with concurrency. I need to make sure that I'm not running into memory issues or having goroutines step on each other's toes. Go's concurrency model is designed to handle these issues well, but I still need to implement it carefully.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved:\n\n1. **Reading the dataset**: Since it's a large dataset, like log files, I should read it in chunks rather than loading everything into memory at once. Go's `io.Reader` and `bufio.Scanner` can help with that.\n\n2. **Tokenizing the text**: I need to split the text into words. In Go, I can use `strings.Split` or `strings.Fields` to break the text into words based on whitespace.\n\n3. **Counting word frequencies**: This is where concurrency comes in. I can have multiple goroutines processing different chunks of the text and counting word frequencies independently. Then, they can send their counts to a central channel, and another goroutine can aggregate these counts.\n\n4. **Aggregating the counts**: I need a way to combine the word counts from all the goroutines. A map seems suitable for this, where the keys are words and the values are their counts.\n\n5. **Finding the top 10 words**: Once all the counts are aggregated, I need to sort the words based on their frequencies and pick the top 10.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure this in code.\n\nFirst, I'll need to read the file in chunks. I can use a `bufio.Scanner` to read the file line by line, which is efficient for large files.\n\nThen, for each chunk (or line), I can start a goroutine to process it. In that goroutine, I'll split the line into words and count their frequencies, probably using a local map.\n\nAfter processing, each goroutine can send its map of word counts to a central channel.\n\nMeanwhile, another goroutine can be listening on this channel, merging the received maps into a single global map.\n\nFinally, once all goroutines have finished processing and sending their counts, I can sort the global map by value and pick the top 10 entries.\n\nWait a minute, merging maps in a concurrent environment can be tricky because maps are not concurrency-safe in Go. If multiple goroutines try to write to the same map simultaneously, it can lead to data races.\n\nTo avoid this, I need to synchronize access to the global map. One way is to use a mutex (mutual exclusion lock) to protect the map during writes. However, using a mutex can become a bottleneck if there are many goroutines trying to write frequently.\n\nAnother approach is to have each goroutine maintain its own local map and send the entire map to a central collector via a channel when it's done processing. The collector can then merge these local maps into the global map without worrying about concurrent writes, since the collector is the only one writing to the global map.\n\nThis seems like a better approach. So, each goroutine processes its chunk, builds a local word count map, and sends it to a channel. The collector goroutine receives these maps one by one and merges them into the global map.\n\nOnce all processing goroutines have finished and sent their maps, I need a way to signal that no more maps will be sent, so the collector can proceed to the next step.\n\nIn Go, I can close the channel when no more values will be sent, and the collector can range over the channel until it's closed.\n\nSo, here's a high-level plan:\n\n- Create a channel to receive maps of word counts.\n\n- Start N goroutines to process chunks of the dataset. Each goroutine reads a chunk, processes it, builds a map of word counts, and sends it to the channel.\n\n- Start a collector goroutine that reads from the channel and merges the received maps into a global map.\n\n- After starting all the processing goroutines, close the channel to indicate that no more maps will be sent.\n\n- Wait for the collector goroutine to finish merging all maps.\n\n- Once the collector is done, sort the global map by value and pick the top 10 entries.\n\n- Finally, print or return the top 10 words and their frequencies.\n\nNow, I need to decide how to split the dataset into chunks for the goroutines. Since I'm reading the file line by line with `bufio.Scanner`, I can assign batches of lines to each goroutine.\n\nFor example, if I have 1000 lines in the file, I can have 10 goroutines, each processing 100 lines.\n\nBut determining the optimal number of goroutines is tricky. Too many goroutines can lead to scheduling overhead, while too few might not fully utilize the available concurrency.\n\nA common approach is to have a worker pool with a fixed number of goroutines, and feed the work items (chunks of data) to them via a channel.\n\nIn Go, I can create a worker pool by starting N goroutines that each repeatedly take a work item from a channel, process it, and repeat until there are no more items.\n\nThis way, I can control the degree of concurrency by adjusting the number of workers.\n\nSo, perhaps I'll create a work queue channel that sends ranges of lines or specific chunks of the file to the worker goroutines.\n\nBut since I'm reading the file line by line, maybe it's simpler to have the main goroutine read lines and distribute them to worker goroutines via a channel.\n\nWait, but that might not be the most efficient, as the main goroutine could become a bottleneck if it's reading lines and distributing them to workers sequentially.\n\nAn alternative is to have multiple goroutines reading different parts of the file concurrently. However, file I/O in Go is already handled efficiently by the runtime, and reading from the same file concurrently could lead to seeks and performance issues.\n\nTherefore, it's probably better to have one goroutine read the file sequentially and distribute lines to worker goroutines.\n\nSo, here's an updated plan:\n\n- Have a worker pool of N goroutines, each waiting to process a chunk of lines.\n\n- Have a main goroutine that reads lines from the file and sends batches of lines to the worker goroutines via a channel.\n\n- Each worker processes its batch of lines, counts the words, and sends the local word count map to a results channel.\n\n- Have a collector goroutine that merges the local maps from the results channel into a global map.\n\n- Once all lines have been distributed, close the work channel to signal workers to finish.\n\n- After all workers have finished and sent their results, close the results channel.\n\n- The collector goroutine can then proceed to sort the global map and find the top 10 words.\n\nI need to ensure that the main goroutine waits for all worker goroutines to finish before closing the results channel and proceeding to the next steps.\n\nTo manage this, I can use a wait group. In Go, the `sync.WaitGroup` can be used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n\n- Create a work channel that sends slices of lines to worker goroutines.\n\n- Create a results channel that receives maps of word counts from worker goroutines.\n\n- Start the collector goroutine that reads from the results channel and merges the maps into a global map.\n\n- Start N worker goroutines that each loop, receiving batches of lines from the work channel, process them, and send the local word count map to the results channel.\n\n- In the main goroutine, read lines from the file, batch them into slices, and send these slices to the work channel.\n\n- After sending all batches, close the work channel.\n\n- Wait for all worker goroutines to finish using a WaitGroup.\n\n- Once all workers have finished and the results channel is closed, the collector goroutine can finish merging and proceed to sort the global map.\n\n- Finally, print the top 10 words.\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, let's think about some details.\n\nFirst, how to batch the lines. I could batch them in fixed sizes, say 100 lines per batch, and send each batch to a worker goroutine.\n\nBut if the file has a variable number of lines, I need to ensure that all lines are processed.\n\nAlso, if the number of lines isn't a multiple of the batch size, I'll have to handle the last batch properly.\n\nAlternatively, I could send individual lines to the work channel, and have each worker process one line at a time. However, this might create too much overhead due to the large number of messages.\n\nBatching lines into larger chunks should be more efficient.\n\nLet's decide on a batch size, say 100 lines per batch.\n\nNow, regarding the worker goroutines, how many should there be?\n\nThe optimal number depends on the number of CPU cores available, as well as other factors like I/O bottlenecks.\n\nIn Go, it's common to set the number of workers to the number of available CPU cores.\n\nI can get the number of CPU cores using `runtime.NumCPU()` and set the number of workers accordingly.\n\nThis way, the application can scale with the available resources.\n\nAlright, moving forward.\n\nNext, in each worker goroutine, after receiving a batch of lines, I need to process them to count the words.\n\nI'll need to split each line into words. In Go, `strings.Split` can be used, but I need to decide on the separator.\n\nLog files can have varying formats, so perhaps using `regexp` to split the line into words would be more robust.\n\nI can define a regular expression that matches word characters and ignores punctuation and other non-word characters.\n\nFor example, I can use `\\w+` to match sequences of word characters.\n\nAlso, I need to handle case sensitivity. Should the word counts be case-sensitive or case-insensitive?\n\nProbably, it's better to make it case-insensitive, so \"Word\" and \"word\" are considered the same.\n\nTherefore, I'll convert all words to lowercase before counting.\n\nOkay, so in each worker goroutine:\n\n- Receive a batch of lines.\n\n- Initialize a local map to store word counts.\n\n- For each line in the batch:\n\n- Use regexp to find all words.\n\n- Convert words to lowercase.\n\n- Increment the count in the local map.\n\n- After processing all lines in the batch, send the local map to the results channel.\n\nSimple enough.\n\nNow, in the collector goroutine:\n\n- Initialize a global map to store aggregated word counts.\n\n- Loop over the results channel, receiving local maps.\n\n- For each local map received, merge it into the global map by adding the counts for each word.\n\n- Once the results channel is closed, indicating that all worker goroutines have finished sending their maps, the collector can proceed to sort the global map.\n\nSorting a map by value is a bit tricky in Go because maps are unordered by default.\n\nI'll need to convert the map into a slice of key-value pairs and sort the slice based on the values.\n\nTo get the top 10 words, I can sort the slice in descending order of counts and take the first 10 elements.\n\nFinally, print or return these top 10 words and their counts.\n\nWait, but I need to think about how to handle words with the same frequency. Should they be sorted alphabetically in that case?\n\nProbably, to have a consistent ordering.\n\nSo, I'll need a custom sort function that first sorts by count descending, and then by word ascending.\n\nIn Go, I can define a struct to hold the word and count, and implement the `sort.Interface` to sort the slice accordingly.\n\nAlright, that's manageable.\n\nNow, error handling is important, especially when dealing with file I/O.\n\nI need to handle cases where the file doesn't exist, or there are permissions issues, or the file is empty.\n\nAlso, since we're using concurrency, I need to make sure that any panics or errors in goroutines are properly handled and don't crash the entire application.\n\nIn Go, it's common to use `defer` to recover from panics in goroutines and log any errors.\n\nI'll need to implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.\n\nAdditionally, for large datasets, memory usage is a concern.\n\nIf the dataset is extremely large, even processing it in chunks, the global map could grow very large, potentially consuming a lot of memory.\n\nI need to make sure that the application doesn't run out of memory. One way is to process the dataset in smaller chunks and aggregate the counts incrementally.\n\nBut since we're already processing in batches, and merging the counts incrementally, it should be manageable.\n\nAnother consideration is that channels in Go are buffered by default, but I can also set a buffer size to optimize performance.\n\nFor example, setting a buffer size on the work channel can allow the main goroutine to send batches without blocking, up to the buffer size.\n\nSimilarly, the results channel can have a buffer to allow workers to send their maps without waiting for the collector to process them immediately.\n\nChoosing appropriate buffer sizes can improve performance by reducing contention and blocking.\n\nBut in Go, it's often sufficient to use unbuffered channels, as they enable proper synchronization between goroutines.\n\nI'll start with unbuffered channels and see if performance is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation in code.\n\nI'll need to import the necessary packages:\n\n- `bufio` for reading the file efficiently.\n\n- `io/ioutil` to read the file.\n\n- `os` to handle file operations.\n\n- `regexp` for splitting lines into words.\n\n- `sort` for sorting the word counts.\n\n- `strings` for string manipulation.\n\n- `sync` for using WaitGroup.\n\n- `fmt` for printing the results.\n\nWait, actually, `io/ioutil` is deprecated in Go 1.16 and later. Instead, I should use `os.Open` and `io.Reader` for reading the file.\n\nSo, I'll use `os.Open` to open the file and `bufio.Scanner` to read it line by line.\n\nOkay, let's outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, define the main function:\n\n- Open the file.\n\n- Create a work channel to send batches of lines to workers.\n\n- Create a results channel to receive local word count maps from workers.\n\n- Start the collector goroutine to merge the local maps into a global map.\n\n- Start N worker goroutines to process batches of lines and send local maps to the results channel.\n\n- In the main goroutine, read lines from the file, batch them into slices, and send these slices to the work channel.\n\n- After sending all batches, close the work channel.\n\n- Wait for all worker goroutines to finish using a WaitGroup.\n\n- Close the results channel.\n\n- Wait for the collector goroutine to finish.\n\n- Sort the global map and get the top 10 words.\n\n- Print the top 10 words and their counts.\n\nNow, let's think about the worker goroutines.\n\nEach worker will:\n\n- Receive a batch of lines from the work channel.\n\n- Initialize a local map for word counts.\n\n- For each line in the batch:\n\n- Use regexp to find all words.\n\n- Convert words to lowercase.\n\n- Increment the counts in the local map.\n\n- Send the local map to the results channel.\n\nRepeat this until there are no more batches in the work channel.\n\nSimilarly, the collector goroutine will:\n\n- Initialize a global map for aggregated word counts.\n\n- Loop over the results channel, merging each local map into the global map.\n\n- Once the results channel is closed, sort the global map and store the top 10 words.\n\nFinally, the main goroutine will print the top 10 words.\n\nWait, but I need to think about how to pass the global map from the collector goroutine back to the main goroutine.\n\nOne way is to use another channel to send the sorted top 10 words back to the main goroutine.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a mutex to protect access to the global map and have the main goroutine access it after all workers and the collector have finished.\n\nBut using a channel to signal when the collector is done and to pass the result back to the main goroutine seems cleaner.\n\nSo, I'll have the collector goroutine sort the global map and send the top 10 words back to the main goroutine via a channel.\n\nThis way, the main goroutine can wait for the collector to finish and then print the results.\n\nAlright, let's adjust the plan slightly.\n\n- Create a work channel for sending batches of lines to workers.\n\n- Create a results channel for workers to send local word count maps to the collector.\n\n- Create a done channel for the collector to signal when it's finished and to send the top 10 words back to the main goroutine.\n\n- Start the collector goroutine, which merges local maps from the results channel into a global map, sorts it, picks the top 10, and sends them to the done channel.\n\n- Start N worker goroutines that receive batches from the work channel, process them, and send local maps to the results channel.\n\n- In the main goroutine, read lines from the file, batch them, and send batches to the work channel.\n\n- After sending all batches, close the work channel.\n\n- Wait for all worker goroutines to finish using a WaitGroup.\n\n- Close the results channel after all workers have finished.\n\n- Receive the top 10 words from the done channel.\n\n- Print the top 10 words.\n\nThis seems more organized.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nFor word counts, I'll use a map with string keys and int values.\n\nFor the top 10 words, I'll create a slice of structs, where each struct has a word and its count, and sort this slice.\n\nDefine a struct, say `WordCount`, with fields `Word string` and `Count int`.\n\nThen, implement the `sort.Interface` for a slice of `WordCount` to sort them by count descending and word ascending.\n\nGo's `sort` package allows defining custom sorting by providing a slice that implements `sort.Interface`, which includes `Len`, `Less`, and `Swap` methods.\n\nSo, I'll need to define these methods for my slice of `WordCount`.\n\nAlright, let's proceed.\n\nNow, to handle the collector goroutine sending the top 10 words back to the main goroutine, I can define a channel that sends a slice of `WordCount`.\n\nSo, `done := make(chan []WordCount)`.\n\nThe collector goroutine, after sorting the global map, will send the top 10 words through this channel.\n\nThe main goroutine can then receive from this channel and print the results.\n\nAlso, to make sure that the collector goroutine doesn't proceed before all workers have finished sending their results, I need to close the results channel after all workers have finished.\n\nIn Go, ranging over a closed channel allows the receiver to process all remaining values and then stop.\n\nSo, in the collector goroutine, I can range over the results channel until it's closed, merging all received maps, then sort and send the top 10 words.\n\nIn the main goroutine, after all workers have finished and the results channel is closed, I can receive the top 10 words from the done channel and print them.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the word counting in the worker goroutines.\n\nEach worker will receive a batch of lines, process them, and create a local word count map.\n\nTo split lines into words, I'll use a regular expression.\n\nI can define a regex pattern like `\\w+` to match words.\n\nUsing `regexp.FindAllString` can help find all occurrences of the pattern in a string.\n\nSo, in each worker goroutine:\n\n- Receive a batch of lines.\n\n- Initialize a local map `map[string]int`.\n\n- For each line in the batch:\n\n- Convert the line to lowercase.\n\n- Use regexp.FindAllString to get all words.\n\n- For each word, increment its count in the local map.\n\n- Send the local map to the results channel.\n\nSimple enough.\n\nNow, in the collector goroutine:\n\n- Initialize a global map `map[string]int`.\n\n- Loop over the results channel, receiving local maps.\n\n- For each local map, iterate over its keys and add the counts to the global map.\n\n- Once the results channel is closed, convert the global map to a slice of `WordCount`.\n\n- Sort the slice using the custom sort function.\n\n- Take the top 10 elements and send them to the done channel.\n\nAlright.\n\nNow, implementing the custom sort.\n\nDefine a type, say `WordCountSlice`, which is a slice of `WordCount`.\n\nImplement `Len`, `Less`, and `Swap` methods for `WordCountSlice` to sort it by count descending and word ascending.\n\nHere's a rough idea:\n\ntype WordCount struct {\n\nWord string\n\nCount int\n\n}\n\ntype WordCountSlice []WordCount\n\nfunc (s WordCountSlice) Len() int {\n\nreturn len(s)\n\n}\n\nfunc (s WordCountSlice) Less(i, j int) bool {\n\nif s[i].Count == s[j].Count {\n\nreturn s[i].Word < s[j].Word // ascending order for words\n\n}\n\nreturn s[i].Count > s[j].Count // descending order for counts\n\n}\n\nfunc (s WordCountSlice) Swap(i, j int) {\n\ns[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\n\n}\n\nThis should sort the slice first by count descending, and if counts are equal, by word ascending.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, to convert the global map to a slice for sorting, I'll need to iterate over the map and create a slice of `WordCount`.\n\nBe careful with map iteration order, but since we're sorting afterwards, the iteration order doesn't matter.\n\nAlright.\n\nNow, let's think about batching the lines in the main goroutine.\n\nI need to read lines from the file, batch them into slices of a certain size, and send these slices to the work channel.\n\nFor example, batch size of 100 lines.\n\nI can use a counter to keep track of how many lines have been read and sent.\n\nOnce all lines are sent, close the work channel.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the last batch is sent even if it's smaller than the batch size.\n\nIn Go, `bufio.Scanner` can be used to read lines from the file efficiently.\n\nI'll initialize a `bufio.Scanner` with the file reader and loop over the Scanner to read lines.\n\nIn each iteration, collect lines into a slice until it reaches the batch size, then send the slice to the work channel.\n\nIf the remaining lines are less than the batch size, still send them as a smaller batch.\n\nAfter sending all batches, close the work channel.\n\nMeanwhile, the worker goroutines are receiving batches from the work channel and processing them.\n\nOnce all batches are sent and the work channel is closed, the worker goroutines will finish processing and exit.\n\nThe main goroutine needs to wait for all worker goroutines to finish before closing the results channel.\n\nTo manage this, I'll use a `sync.WaitGroup`.\n\nI'll set the WaitGroup counter to the number of worker goroutines.\n\nAfter starting the workers, in each worker goroutine, call `wg.Done()` after it's finished processing all batches.\n\nIn the main goroutine, after sending all batches and closing the work channel, call `wg.Wait()` to wait for all workers to finish.\n\nThen, close the results channel to signal the collector goroutine that no more local maps will be sent.\n\nFinally, receive the top 10 words from the done channel and print them.\n\nThis should cover the flow.\n\nNow, let's think about error handling.\n\nFirst, when opening the file, check if there are any errors, like the file not existing or permission issues.\n\nUse `os.Open` and handle any returned errors.\n\nAlso, in the worker goroutines, if there are any panics during processing, I need to recover from them to prevent the entire application from crashing.\n\nIn Go, I can use `defer recover` in each worker goroutine to catch panics and log errors.\n\nSimilarly, in the collector goroutine, handle any panics.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that all resources are properly closed, like the file reader.\n\nIn Go, using `defer` to close the file after reading is a good practice.\n\nAlso, make sure that channels are closed properly to avoid deadlocks.\n\nFor example, closing the work channel after sending all batches, and closing the results channel after all workers have finished.\n\nThe done channel can be sent over once by the collector goroutine, and the main goroutine can receive from it and proceed.\n\nNow, regarding the command-line arguments.\n\nThe application should take the dataset file path as a command-line argument.\n\nI can use `os.Args` to get the command-line arguments.\n\nMake sure to handle cases where the file path is missing or invalid.\n\nAlso, perhaps allow specifying the number of worker goroutines via a command-line flag.\n\nIn Go, the `flag` package can be used to parse command-line flags.\n\nFor example, `-workers=10` to set the number of worker goroutines.\n\nThis way, the user can adjust the concurrency level based on their system's capabilities.\n\nAlternatively, default to the number of available CPU cores using `runtime.NumCPU()`.\n\nNow, let's think about testing this application.\n\nSince it involves file I/O and concurrency, testing can be a bit tricky.\n\nI can write unit tests for individual components, like the word counting logic in a worker goroutine, or the sorting function.\n\nFor example, create a test that\u6a21\u62dfs a batch of lines, processes them, and checks the word counts.\n\nSimilarly, test the sorting function with a known map and verify that the top 10 are correctly sorted.\n\nFor integration testing, I can create a small test file with known content and run the application to see if it correctly identifies the top words.\n\nAlso, consider edge cases, like an empty file, a file with only one word, files with special characters or non-ASCII characters.\n\nMake sure that the word splitting regex handles these cases correctly.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the application doesn't crash with large files, although thorough performance testing may be needed to optimize for very large datasets.\n\nNow, thinking about performance.\n\nSince we're processing the file line by line and distributing batches to worker goroutines, the application should scale well with the number of CPU cores.\n\nHowever, if the dataset is extremely large, memory usage could be a concern, especially for the global map.\n\nIn Go, maps are efficient, but with billions of unique words, memory could become an issue.\n\nFor most practical purposes, though, it should be fine.\n\nIf memory becomes a problem, consider using a database or an external data structure to store word counts.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that the dataset is manageable in memory.\n\nAlright, I think I have a solid plan for implementing this application.\n\nLet me summarize the steps:\n\n1. Parse command-line arguments to get the file path and optional number of worker goroutines.\n\n2. Open the dataset file and handle any errors.\n\n3. Create a work channel to send batches of lines to workers.\n\n4. Create a results channel to receive local word count maps from workers.\n\n5. Create a done channel to receive the top 10 words from the collector.\n\n6. Start the collector goroutine to merge local maps and sort to get the top 10 words.\n\n7. Determine the number of worker goroutines (default to `runtime.NumCPU()`).\n\n8. Start N worker goroutines to process batches of lines and send local maps to the results channel.\n\n9. In the main goroutine, read lines from the file, batch them, and send batches to the work channel.\n\n10. After sending all batches, close the work channel.\n\n11. Wait for all worker goroutines to finish using a WaitGroup.\n\n12. Close the results channel.\n\n13. Receive the top 10 words from the done channel.\n\n14. Print the top 10 words and their counts.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to implement this in Go code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a large dataset (such as log files) concurrently in Golang, calculate the frequency of each unique word, and output the top 10 most frequent words. We will utilize goroutines and channels for concurrency.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading the dataset**: Read the file line by line using `bufio.Scanner` for efficiency.\n2. **Tokenizing the text**: Split each line into words using a regular expression that matches word characters.\n3. **Counting word frequencies**: Use multiple goroutines to process batches of lines concurrently. Each goroutine will count the frequency of words in its batch and send the results to a central channel.\n4. **Aggregating the counts**: A collector goroutine will merge the word counts from all worker goroutines into a global map.\n5. **Finding the top 10 words**: Once all goroutines have finished, sort the global map by word frequencies and pick the top 10 words.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"regexp\"\n\t\"sort\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\t\"sync\"\n)\n\ntype WordCount struct {\n\tWord  string\n\tCount int\n}\n\ntype WordCountSlice []WordCount\n\nfunc (p WordCountSlice) Len() int           { return len(p) }\nfunc (p WordCountSlice) Less(i, j int) bool {\n\tif p[i].Count == p[j].Count {\n\t\treturn p[i].Word < p[j].Word\n\t}\n\treturn p[i].Count > p[j].Count\n}\nfunc (p WordCountSlice) Swap(i, j int)      { p[i], p[j] = p[j], p[i] }\n\nfunc main() {\n\tflag.Parse()\n\tif flag.NArg() == 0 {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"File path is missing\")\n\t}\n\tfilePath := flag.Arg(0)\n\n\tvar numWorkers = flag.Int(\"workers\", 0, \"Number of worker goroutines\")\n\tif *numWorkers == 0 {\n\t\t*numWorkers = runtime.NumCPU()\n\t}\n\n\tfile, err := os.Open(filePath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error opening file: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\twork := make(chan []string)\n\tresults := make(chan map[string]int)\n\tdone := make(chan WordCountSlice)\n\n\tgo collector(results, done)\n\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\tfor i := 0; i < *numWorkers; i++ {\n\t\twg.Add(1)\n\t\tgo worker(work, results, &wg)\n\t}\n\n\tbatchSize := 100\n\tvar lines []string\n\tscanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)\n\tfor scanner.Scan() {\n\t\tlines = append(lines, strings.ToLower(scanner.Text()))\n\t\tif len(lines) >= batchSize {\n\t\t\twork <- lines\n\t\t\tlines = []string{}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tif len(lines) > 0 {\n\t\twork <- lines\n\t}\n\n\tclose(work)\n\twg.Wait()\n\tclose(results)\n\n\ttop10 := <-done\n\n\tfor _, wc := range top10 {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%s: %d\\n\", wc.Word, wc.Count)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc worker(work <-chan []string, results chan<- map[string]int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {\n\tdefer wg.Done()\n\tre := regexp.MustCompile(`\\w+`)\n\tlocalCounts := make(map[string]int)\n\tfor lines := range work {\n\t\tfor _, line := range lines {\n\t\t\twords := re.FindAllString(line, -1)\n\t\t\tfor _, word := range words {\n\t\t\t\tlocalCounts[word]++\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tresults <- localCounts\n}\n\nfunc collector(results <-chan map[string]int, done chan<- WordCountSlice) {\n\tglobalCounts := make(map[string]int)\n\tfor localCounts := range results {\n\t\tfor word, count := range localCounts {\n\t\t\tglobalCounts[word] += count\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tvar wordCounts WordCountSlice\n\tfor word, count := range globalCounts {\n\t\twordCounts = append(wordCounts, WordCount{word, count})\n\t}\n\tsort.Stable(wordCounts)\n\tdone <- wordCounts[:10]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the dataset**: The file is opened and read line by line using `bufio.Scanner`.\n2. **Tokenizing the text**: Words are extracted from each line using a regular expression that matches sequences of word characters.\n3. **Counting word frequencies**: Multiple worker goroutines process batches of lines, count word frequencies, and send their local counts to a results channel.\n4. **Aggregating the counts**: A collector goroutine merges the local counts into a global map.\n5. **Finding the top 10 words**: The global map is sorted by frequency, and the top 10 words are selected and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient and concurrent processing of large datasets, leveraging Go's goroutines and channels for parallelism."
