        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where 60% of the people have dogs and 40% have cats. Additionally, among those who own dogs, 30% also own cats. The question is asking for the percentage of cat owners who also own dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between dog owners and cat owners. Let's assume there are 100 people in the town to make the calculations easier.\n\nSo, 60% of 100 people have dogs, which is 60 people. And 40% have cats, which is 40 people.\n\nNow, among the dog owners, 30% also own cats. So, 30% of 60 dog owners also own cats. That's 0.30 * 60 = 18 people.\n\nThese 18 people own both dogs and cats.\n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of cat owners also own dogs. We know that there are 40 cat owners in total, and out of these, 18 also own dogs.\n\nSo, the percentage of cat owners who also own dogs is (18 / 40) * 100%.\n\nLet's calculate that: 18 divided by 40 is 0.45, and multiplied by 100% is 45%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to use the concept of conditional probability. The probability that a person owns a cat given that they own a dog is 30%. We need to find the probability that a person owns a dog given that they own a cat.\n\nIn probability terms:\n\nP(Cat|Dog) = 30%\n\nWe need P(Dog|Cat).\n\nWe also know that P(Dog) = 60% and P(Cat) = 40%.\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(Dog|Cat) = [P(Cat and Dog)] / P(Cat)\n\nWe already know P(Cat and Dog) is 18%, since 18 out of 100 people own both.\n\nSo, P(Dog|Cat) = 18% / 40% = 0.45, or 45%.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using Venn diagrams.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents dog owners (60%), and the other represents cat owners (40%). The overlapping area represents people who own both dogs and cats.\n\nWe know that among dog owners, 30% also own cats. So, the overlapping area is 30% of the dog owners, which is 18% of the total population.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of cat owners who also own dogs, we need to look at the overlapping area relative to the entire cat owners' circle.\n\nSo, overlapping area is 18% of total, and cat owners are 40% of total.\n\nThus, the percentage of cat owners who also own dogs is (18% / 40%) * 100% = 45%.\n\nEverything points to 45%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45\\%} \\]"
