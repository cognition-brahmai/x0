The question is, how many apples does Tom have?\n\nOkay, so initially, there are 5 apples on the table. Tom takes away 2 apples. So, Tom now has 2 apples. Then, Jane takes away 1 apple. But Jane is taking from the table, not from Tom. So, the number of apples Tom has doesn't change when Jane takes one.\n\nTherefore, Tom still has the 2 apples he took earlier.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about this differently. Perhaps there's a trick here.\n\nLet me consider the total number of apples. Starting with 5 apples on the table.\n\nTom takes away 2 apples: so, table now has 5 - 2 = 3 apples.\n\nThen Jane takes away 1 apple: so, table now has 3 - 1 = 2 apples.\n\nBut the question is asking how many apples Tom has, not how many are left on the table.\n\nTom took 2 apples, so he has 2 apples.\n\nUnless, maybe, Jane took one apple from Tom, but the question says Jane takes away 1 apple, and it doesn't specify from whom or where. It says \"from the table,\" implied.\n\nSo, I think the answer is that Tom has 2 apples.\n\nBut the title says \"Tom and Jane's apple adventure,\" which might suggest that there's more to the story, but based on the information given, Tom has 2 apples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's more context or perhaps the question is trying to be misleading in some way.\n\nLet me consider another angle: maybe Tom and Jane are taking apples from each other or something, but the statement says Tom takes away 2 apples, and Jane takes away 1 apple, and it's about apples on the table.\n\nI think the straightforward approach is correct: Tom took 2 apples from the table, Jane took 1 apple from the table, so Tom has 2 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
