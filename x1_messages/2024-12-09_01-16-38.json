        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Python script that fetches weather information from an external API, we'll need to use a library like `requests` to make HTTP requests. We'll also need an API key from a weather service provider like OpenWeatherMap.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Sign up for an API key:**\n   - Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and sign up for a free account.\n   - Once you have an account, navigate to the API section and get an API key.\n\n2. **Install the requests library:**\n   - If you don't have the `requests` library installed, you can install it using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install requests\n     ```\n\n3. **Create the Python script:**\n   - We'll write a script that takes a city name as input, makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and prints the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n\nHere's a sample script:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        'q': city,\n        'appid': api_key,\n        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        temperature = data['main']['temp']\n        humidity = data['main']['humidity']\n        wind_speed = data['wind']['speed']\n        \n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(\"City not found or unable to retrieve data.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    city = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    api_key = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    get_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import the requests library:**\n   - This library allows us to send HTTP requests easily.\n\n2. **Define the `get_weather` function:**\n   - This function takes a city name and an API key as inputs.\n   - It constructs the API URL and parameters.\n   - It sends a GET request to the API.\n   - If the request is successful (status code 200), it parses the JSON response and extracts the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n   - It prints these values.\n\n3. **Main block:**\n   - It prompts the user to enter a city name.\n   - It calls the `get_weather` function with the provided city name and API key.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.\n- The `units` parameter is set to `'metric'` for Celsius. If you prefer Fahrenheit, set it to `'imperial'`.\n- Handle exceptions and errors as needed for a more robust script.\n\nThis script should give you a good starting point for fetching and displaying weather information using Python and an external API."
