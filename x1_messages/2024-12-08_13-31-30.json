The story is set in the vibrant and decadent era of the Roaring Twenties and explores themes of love, wealth, and the American Dream through the eyes of its narrator, Nick Carraway. The novel is renowned for its poignant portrayal of the Jazz Age and its critique of the societal values of the time."
