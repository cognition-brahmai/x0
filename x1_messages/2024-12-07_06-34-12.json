        "content": "So I have this problem here: an ant travels at a speed of 1 cm per second, and I need to find out how long it would take for the ant to travel 1 meter. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the units involved. The ant's speed is given in centimeters per second (cm/s), and the distance is in meters (m). I know that 1 meter equals 100 centimeters. So, I need to convert the distance to the same unit as the speed to make the calculations consistent.\n\nSo, distance = 1 meter = 100 centimeters.\n\nSpeed = 1 cm/s.\n\nNow, I need to find the time it takes to cover that distance at that speed.\n\nI remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = distance / speed.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 100 cm / 1 cm/s.\n\nWhen I divide centimeters by centimeters per second, the centimeters cancel out, and I'm left with seconds.\n\nSo, time = 100 seconds.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf the ant travels 1 cm every second, then to travel 100 cm, it should take 100 seconds. That seems logical.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the units again.\n\nDistance: 100 cm.\n\nSpeed: 1 cm/s.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 100 cm / 1 cm/s = 100 s.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If the ant travels 1 cm in 1 second, then it would travel 100 cm in 100 seconds.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for speed: speed = distance / time.\n\nRearranging for time: time = distance / speed.\n\nAgain, plugging in the values: time = 100 cm / 1 cm/s = 100 s.\n\nI'm getting consistent results, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the time, like the ant's resting times or changes in speed. However, the problem doesn't mention any such factors, so I can assume the ant travels at a constant speed without stopping.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I've converted the units correctly. 1 meter is indeed 100 centimeters. I know that because there are 100 centimeters in a meter.\n\nWait, just to be extra sure, let's recall the metric system prefixes. \"Centi-\" means one-hundredth (1/100), so 1 centimeter is 0.01 meters, or conversely, 1 meter is 100 centimeters.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 100 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
