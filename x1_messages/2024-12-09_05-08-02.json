Each plan should be associated with an evidence value which will serve as the output of one of the functions given an input string that can either be the user's question, previous evidence values or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nBing[input]: A tool that enables users to search for information using Bing search engine. This tool is handy in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question. The function doesn't directly provide the answer; it finds a list of sites that might have the solution.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from websites provided in the input string containing newline delimited links. Input is one or more links and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkGrabber[input]: Extracts links from plain text and provides a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nNLP[input]: Natural Language Processing model useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :data[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :data1:?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., NLP[What is the capital of France, given :data3:?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :data0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:data[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book '1984' and what other notable works have they written?"
