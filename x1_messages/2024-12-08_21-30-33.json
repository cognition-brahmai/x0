        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The profit for each Type A widget is $3, and for Type B, it's $4. The store sold a total of 200 widgets and made a total profit of $700. We need to find out how many of each type were sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A widgets sold.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B widgets sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of widgets sold is 200.\n\n2. The total profit from selling these widgets is $700.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 200 \\)  (since the total number of widgets is 200)\n\n2. \\( 3x + 4y = 700 \\)  (since the profit from Type A is $3 per widget and from Type B is $4 per widget, and the total profit is $700)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. Let's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 200 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 3(200 - y) + 4y = 700 \\)\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 600 - 3y + 4y = 700 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 600 + y = 700 \\)\n\nSubtract 600 from both sides:\n\n\\( y = 100 \\)\n\nNow that we have \\( y \\), which is the number of Type B widgets, we can find \\( x \\) using the first equation:\n\n\\( x = 200 - y = 200 - 100 = 100 \\)\n\nSo, the store sold 100 Type A widgets and 100 Type B widgets.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they sold 100 Type A widgets at $3 each, that's \\( 100 \\times 3 = 300 \\) dollars. For Type B, 100 widgets at $4 each is \\( 100 \\times 4 = 400 \\) dollars. Adding those profits together: \\( 300 + 400 = 700 \\), which matches the total profit given.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used elimination to solve the system of equations. Let's try that method as well to confirm.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 200 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3x + 4y = 700 \\)\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \\( x \\):\n\n\\( 3x + 3y = 600 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this new equation from the second equation:\n\n\\( (3x + 4y) - (3x + 3y) = 700 - 600 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( y = 100 \\)\n\nAgain, we get \\( y = 100 \\), and then \\( x = 200 - 100 = 100 \\).\n\nSo, both methods give us the same answer: 100 Type A widgets and 100 Type B widgets.\n\nJust to explore another approach, let's consider using ratios or thinking about the average profit per widget.\n\nThe total profit is $700 from 200 widgets, so the average profit per widget is \\( \\frac{700}{200} = 3.5 \\) dollars.\n\nSince Type A widgets bring $3 profit and Type B bring $4, the average of $3.5 suggests that equal numbers of each type were sold, because $3.5 is right in the middle between $3 and $4.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense that the store sold an equal number of both types, which is what our earlier calculations showed: 100 of each.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more precise with this approach, we can think in terms of weighted averages.\n\nLet \\( p \\) be the proportion of Type A widgets sold. Then, \\( 1 - p \\) is the proportion of Type B widgets.\n\nThe average profit per widget is:\n\n\\( 3p + 4(1 - p) = 3p + 4 - 4p = 4 - p \\)\n\nWe know this equals $3.5:\n\n\\( 4 - p = 3.5 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( p \\):\n\n\\( p = 0.5 \\)\n\nSo, 50% of the widgets are Type A, and 50% are Type B.\n\nGiven that 200 widgets were sold, 50% of 200 is 100 for each type.\n\nAgain, this confirms our previous results.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the difference in profit from the average.\n\nEach Type A widget is $0.5 below the average profit, and each Type B is $0.5 above.\n\nSince the total profit is $700, and the average is $3.5, the total profit can also be expressed as:\n\nTotal profit = (number of widgets) \\(\\times\\) (average profit) + (sum of differences from average)\n\nBut in this case, since the average is exactly $3.5, and the differences cancel out, this approach might not be as straightforward.\n\nHowever, we can use the concept of deviations from the average.\n\nLet\u2019s say we have \\( x \\) Type A widgets and \\( y \\) Type B widgets.\n\nThe total deviation from the average is:\n\n\\( x \\times (-0.5) + y \\times 0.5 = 0 \\)  (since the average is $3.5)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( -0.5x + 0.5y = 0 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.5:\n\n\\( -x + y = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = x \\)\n\nThis means the number of Type A widgets is equal to the number of Type B widgets, which again leads us to \\( x = y = 100 \\).\n\nSo, no matter which method we use, we keep arriving at the same conclusion: the store sold 100 Type A widgets and 100 Type B widgets.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be other solutions.\n\nSuppose the store sold more than 100 Type A widgets. Let\u2019s say \\( x = 101 \\), then \\( y = 99 \\).\n\nThe total profit would be:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 101 + 4 \\times 99 = 303 + 396 = 699 \\), which is less than $700.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( x = 99 \\), then \\( y = 101 \\):\n\n\\( 3 \\times 99 + 4 \\times 101 = 297 + 404 = 701 \\), which is more than $700.\n\nSo, only when \\( x = y = 100 \\) does the total profit come out to exactly $700.\n\nTherefore, the solution is unique, and the store sold 100 of each type of widget.\n\nIn summary, by using either substitution, elimination, average profit, or deviation from average methods, we consistently find that the store sold 100 Type A widgets and 100 Type B widgets to achieve a total profit of $700 from 200 widgets sold.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ Type A widgets and } 100 \\text{ Type B widgets}} \\]"
