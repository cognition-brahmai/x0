The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. It's an NP-hard problem, meaning that as the number of cities increases, the time it takes to find an exact solution grows exponentially. However, using dynamic programming, we can efficiently solve TSP for a reasonable number of cities.\n\n### Approach\n\nWe'll use a dynamic programming approach known as the Held-Karp algorithm, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to brute-force methods. The key idea is to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each city from the starting city, given a specific subset of cities that have been visited.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef tsp_dp(distances):\n    n = len(distances)\n    all_sets = (1 << n) - 1  # All bits set to 1, representing all cities visited\n    dp = [[None for _ in range(all_sets + 1)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    def tsp(current, visited):\n        if visited == all_sets:\n            return distances[current][0]  # Return to starting city\n        if dp[current][visited] is not None:\n            return dp[current][visited]\n        \n        min_cost = sys.maxsize\n        for city in range(n):\n            if not (visited & (1 << city)):\n                cost = distances[current][city] + tsp(city, visited | (1 << city))\n                if cost < min_cost:\n                    min_cost = cost\n        dp[current][visited] = min_cost\n        return min_cost\n    \n    return tsp(0, 1)  # Start from city 0, with only city 0 visited\n\n# Example usage\ndistances = [\n    [0, 10, 15, 20],\n    [10, 0, 35, 25],\n    [15, 35, 0, 30],\n    [20, 25, 30, 0]\n]\nprint(tsp_dp(distances))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We have a 2D list `dp` where `dp[current][visited]` stores the minimum cost to reach city `current` from the starting city with the set of visited cities represented by `visited`.\n   - `all_sets` is a bitmask representing all cities visited.\n\n2. **Recursive Function**:\n   - `tsp(current, visited)` calculates the minimum cost to visit all unvisited cities starting from `current` with the set of visited cities.\n   - If all cities are visited (`visited == all_sets`), return the cost to go back to the starting city (city 0).\n   - If the cost for the current state is already computed, return it.\n   - Otherwise, iterate through all cities that haven't been visited yet, recursively calculate the cost of visiting that city next, and choose the minimum cost.\n\n3. **Bitmasking**:\n   - We use a bitmask to represent the set of visited cities. Each bit in `visited` corresponds to a city. If the `i`-th bit is set, city `i` has been visited.\n   - This allows us to efficiently track subsets of cities and cache results for each subset.\n\n4. **Starting the Recursion**:\n   - We start from city 0 with only city 0 visited (bitmask `1`).\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible subsets of cities efficiently, avoiding redundant calculations through memoization. The time complexity is \\(O(n^2 2^n)\\), which is much better than the brute-force approach's \\(O(n!)\\)."
