It is Tuesday, September 17, 6 a.m. here in New York. And we do begin with breaking news for you, because CNN has just learned that the attack on Saudi Arabia\\'s oil facilities were carried out by low-altitude cruise missiles, launched from an Iranian base near the Iraqi border. U.S. investigators are already on the ground, working with the Saudis to identify the missiles and determine who possesses them. President Trump appears to be toning down the rhetoric on a possible military response. Or he did, at least, until -- I mean, before this new information. And he also has sparked criticism for his deference to the Saudi royal family. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: And in just a few hours, what is being billed as the first actual impeachment hearing on Capitol Hill. That, in and of itself, could be high drama. What makes this even more compelling, the person testifying is the president\\'s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. He was a central player in at least two of the instances of possible obstruction of justice described in the Mueller report. Overnight, we learned the White House is trying to limit what questions Lewandowski can answer, an unprecedented claim of privilege for someone who never worked in the White House. There\\'s also reporting that Lewandowski is itching for a confrontation, so this should be interesting, to say the least. CAMEROTA: OK. So let\\'s get to our breaking news right now on Saudi Arabia. Joining us is CNN senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh, live in Iran\\'s capital of Tehran, and CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson, live in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who broke this story on the cruise missiles moments ago. So Nic, tell us what you have learned. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, what we are learning from a source familiar with the investigation does enhance what we\\'ve already heard from the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that Iran was directly involved in this attack. Saudi officials have already told us that it was Iranian weapons systems that were used. Now, we begin to understand why these conclusions are being drawn. Some of the missiles fell short. They fell in the north, the northern desert in Saudi Arabia, which indicates that the missiles came from the north. The fact that they fell in the desert and some of them didn\\'t explode properly has given investigators, both U.S. and Saudi weapons expert investigators, the opportunity to examine some of the devices in detail and draw these forensic conclusions that the origins of these were in Iran. They also bear a resemblance to weapons systems that have been put on public display by Iranian authorities in the past. But perhaps the most significant detail that\\'s emerged here is that the investigators so far believe both Saudi and U.S. investigators believe there is a very high probability that these low-altitude, drone-enhanced cruise missiles took off from Iranian bases inside Iran close to the border with Iraq, that they flew into Iraqi air space, down through Kuwaiti air space, and into Saudi Arabia. Now what the Saudis have said so far is that they cannot yet determine that this is their official position; that they continue the investigation. But they will take an appropriate response, that they have the capacity and the will to respond to -- to respond forcefully to this type of aggression, if that\\'s what they so determine to do. BERMAN: A very high probability that they were launched from Iran close to the Iraqi border, though not definitive yet, which is interesting. They\\'re not making a definitive statement. Nick Paton Walsh to you in Tehran, what has the Iranian government being saying about this, about whether or not they\\'re responsible in any way for the launch, and what\\'s their new position on negotiations? NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: From the start, Iran has said, we have nothing to do with this. From the beginning, when Mike Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state accused them directly in two tweets to, even as late as last night when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that they -- intimated this was still Yemeni Houthi rebels who are behind that attack, calling it reciprocal for the damage done to Yemen by a Saudi-backed air campaign in the brutal barbaric civil war. And I have to point out also, too, you know, much of the world has been waiting for the evidence here, the actual pieces of missile, the radar possibly. That\\'s been declassified, how these conclusions have been made, too. Those will be questions being asked by Iranian officials here, too, who categorically have denied involvement since the beginning. We move on, though, to where we go next with this. Donald Trump has vacillated about military intervention and even about negotiations, too. We have a definitive line from the most supreme voice available in Iran, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who has said today very simply that there will be no negotiation with the United States at any level. He goes on to say everyone should know and notice that this is a trick, essentially the Trump ploy to get them to the table, they say, and the maximum pressure campaign around it, ratcheting up sanctions and increasing military pressure in the region. He goes on to say, in reference to Donald Trump not being clear about whether he has preconditions for talks, the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, says, \"Sometimes they\" -- that\\'s Trump officials -- \"say negotiation without preconditions, sometimes they say negotiation with 12 conditions. Such remarks are either due to their turbulent politics or a trick to confuse others.\" He also goes on to suggest that possibly, in the future, in a sort of humiliating parallel universe, that Donald Trump apologizes or retracts his comments, gets back into the nuclear deal that was signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama. He may then be allowed to join the multilateral talks around that nuclear deal. Essentially, the most authoritative voice in Iran saying there will be no talks for now. He even says unanimously this has been agreed with the president and the foreign minister being sure that no one in Iran\\'s government could be in any doubt there will be no negotiations, which leads to the next question: what next? Iran says it was not them. U.S. and Saudi Arabia are building a case, at times aggressively, at times haphazardly suggested it was them. Do we see a military response? Donald Trump is clear that he doesn\\'t want that to be, obviously, his next move. He says he doesn\\'t want to start wars. But we are in uncharted territory here. No attack of this magnitude has been launched in the building tension of the past months, and the question now, really, is given there\\'s not really an obvious diplomatic offramp available, where do we go from here? Back to you. CAMEROTA: Nic Robertson, what\\'s the answer to that? What does this -- If the Saudis believe that they have definitively figured out who launched this, because of geography and because of the missile systems, what do they want to do next? ROBERTSON: I think when you read between the lines, that they have reached a conclusion. They\\'re not saying it officially. But what they are trying to do is to internationalize the situation here. They have said that they will bring in U.N. investigators, international expert investigators, to join in the investigation to determine the responsibility for the attack. This is a clear effort, along with saying that it was the global economy that was under threat, because the damage to oil production here was so significant and so severe that this is a global issue that they\\'re willing to let global analysts and investigators in here. But the bottom line is they want support for their position that Iran has become a growing threat in the region. The more international support they can have, the better that that can be achieved through diplomacy. But Saudi Arabia is going to definitively look for a way to ensure that this type of attack never happens on their soil again. BERMAN: All right. Nic Robertson for us in Riyadh and Saudi Arabia. Nick Paton Walsh in Tehran and Iran. Again, CNN all over this story and the breaking developments. We\\'ll bring you more as they come in. Meanwhile, the world markets are waiting in anticipation. Oil prices spiked 10 percent, a huge one-day increase, and the question this morning is how serious will the supply disruption be, and could this alter the entire perception of the oil market, long-term? CNN chief business correspondent Christine Romans here with that -- Roman. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, you guys. When you\\'re talking about a 10 or 15 percent jump in the price of oil, that is dramatic, and it could mean higher prices for American drivers, flyers and consumers. So much oil production taken offline so quickly in coming days and weeks consumers will see it. The only questions are when and how much. Look, gas prices are estimated to climb anywhere from $0.10 to $0.25 a gallon over the next few weeks. Now thankfully, the current average for a gallon of gas nationwide is just $2.56, down from $2.85 a year ago and below the recent peak of near 3 bucks a gallon from May 2018. Now, gas stations would spread out any price hikes over a period of time. A couple of pennies a day for about two weeks. Higher oil prices also mean higher costs for airlines. Shares of American Airlines, Delta and United all tumbled Monday. Airline will most likely have to pass the cost onto you, their customers. Analysts say that could take two to six months to show up in your air fares. Shipping companies, manufacturers, ride share drivers, anyone who uses oil will have to eat the higher cost or pass them along. How high prices go and how long they\\'ll stay there depends on how quickly Saudi Arabia is able to get production back on line. Would this tip the U.S. economy into recession? Most people are telling me no, it won\\'t. Because the United States actually produces energy, as well, on its own. It\\'s not a big net importer like China or Germany or Japan. Those economies will have a bigger hit from higher oil prices in the U.S. overall, guys. CAMEROTA: OK, Christine, thank you very much for all of that context. So it is day two of the strike by nearly 50,000 auto workers against General Motors. Negotiations between the union and GM continued through the night. While both sides are talking, they\\'re also bracing for what could be a long and costly fight. CNN\\'s Vanessa Yurkevich is live in Detroit with the latest. So what\\'s happening this morning, Vanessa? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Alisyn. Well, we know those negotiations went late into last night, but no deal reached yet. We were also hearing throughout the day from a source close to those negotiations that the talks were very tense, both sides trying to dig their heels in, but also noticing that they\\'re pretty far apart in making a deal at this point, as you mentioned. Now, we\\'re also learning the scope of this strike. We are hearing that this is now affecting 55 GM facilities across 19 states in this country. That means that 50,000 workers are now on strike across those areas. We have also been hearing from political figures. We\\'ve been hearing from the president yesterday, calling on both sides to make a deal. We\\'ve been hearing from the 2020 candidates weighing in on this. And we\\'ve also heard from local officials. The lieutenant governor of the state stopped by this picket line behind me yesterday. And he talked about the decline in the auto industry but said it shouldn\\'t fall on the backs of these workers. LT. GOV. GARLIN GILCHRIST (D-MI): I think the U.S. auto industry has seen a lot of challenges, just like the U.S. manufacturing broadly. And so we need to prepare for the future. But it is none of these workers\\' fault, the fact that the industry is in decline. These people are ready and hungry. They\\'re working hard every single day. They\\'re working hard while they\\'re out here, standing up for their rights. So I think the industry, yes, has had some challenges, but the industry has the opportunity to evolve and reinvent itself. And this work force is prepared to do that. YURKEVICH: Now, these workers here and across the country will be out on the picket lines every six hours. They\\'re on six-hour shifts. That\\'s in order to get paid by the union, $250 a week, John, while they\\'re on strike. But that is nowhere near what they get paid from GM. So clearly, these workers holding out hope but also wanting to get back on the job pretty soon -- John. BERMAN: All right. Vanessa Yurkevich for us on the picket lines there. Please keep us posted. So he was fired as the president\\'s campaign manager. He was accused of grabbing a reporter. He was a central player in the Mueller report\\'s explanation of possible obstruction of justice, and now he\\'s the first witness in what is being billed as the first impeachment hearing. Corey Lewandowski set to testify shortly. And this morning, were learning the White House wants to limit what he can answer. Why? That\\'s next.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
