        "content": "So, the train goes from City A to City B, right? And it's moving at an average speed of 100 kilometers per hour, and the whole trip takes 4 hours. The question is asking how far apart these two cities are.\n\nWell, to find the distance between two places when you know the speed and the time, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 100 km/h, and the time is 4 hours. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nDistance = 100 km/h \u00d7 4 h = 400 km\n\nSo, the two cities are 400 kilometers apart.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. If the train is going at 100 kilometers every hour, then in one hour, it covers 100 kilometers. So in two hours, it would cover 200 kilometers, in three hours 300 kilometers, and in four hours, 400 kilometers. That matches what we calculated earlier.\n\nAlso, considering that the speed is average, it means that even if the train sped up or slowed down at times, overall, it averaged out to 100 km/h over the entire journey. So, the total distance should still be 400 kilometers.\n\nI think that's the answer: the two cities are 400 kilometers apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
