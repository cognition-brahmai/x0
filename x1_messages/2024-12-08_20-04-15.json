        "content": "So I've got this problem here about finding the overall average score of students from three different classes: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Each class has a different number of students and a different average score. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an overall average means. I think it's the total sum of all the students' scores divided by the total number of students. That makes sense. So, I need to find the total sum of scores for all classes and then divide that by the total number of students in all classes.\n\nLet me list out the information given:\n\n- Class A: 20 students, average score 75\n\n- Class B: 30 students, average score 80\n\n- Class C: 50 students, average score 85\n\nOkay, so to find the total sum of scores for each class, I can multiply the number of students by the average score for that class.\n\nFor Class A:\n\nSum A = 20 students * 75 = 1500\n\nFor Class B:\n\nSum B = 30 students * 80 = 2400\n\nFor Class C:\n\nSum C = 50 students * 85 = 4250\n\nNow, I'll add up these sums to get the total sum for all classes:\n\nTotal Sum = Sum A + Sum B + Sum C = 1500 + 2400 + 4250 = 8150\n\nNext, I need to find the total number of students:\n\nTotal Students = 20 + 30 + 50 = 100\n\nNow, the overall average should be:\n\nOverall Average = Total Sum / Total Students = 8150 / 100 = 81.5\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nSum A: 20 * 75 = 1500 \u2192 that's correct.\n\nSum B: 30 * 80 = 2400 \u2192 that's correct.\n\nSum C: 50 * 85 = 4250 \u2192 that's correct.\n\nTotal Sum: 1500 + 2400 = 3900, plus 4250 = 8150 \u2192 that's correct.\n\nTotal Students: 20 + 30 = 50, plus 50 = 100 \u2192 correct.\n\nOverall Average: 8150 / 100 = 81.5 \u2192 that seems right.\n\nBut, I recall that when you have different group sizes with different averages, the overall average is a weighted average, where the weights are the sizes of the groups. So, in this case, since Class C has the most students, its average should pull the overall average higher, which it does, as 81.5 is closer to 85 than to 75.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the concept of weighted averages directly?\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe formula for weighted average is:\n\nOverall Average = (Sum of (weight * average)) / total weight\n\nIn this case, the weights are the number of students in each class, and the averages are the class averages.\n\nSo,\n\nOverall Average = (20*75 + 30*80 + 50*85) / (20 + 30 + 50)\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, 81.5 seems to be correct.\n\nIs there another way to verify this?\n\nMaybe I can think about the difference from a baseline average. Let's say I pick 80 as the baseline.\n\nClass A: 75 is 5 below the baseline.\n\nClass B: 80 is equal to the baseline.\n\nClass C: 85 is 5 above the baseline.\n\nNow, I need to see how these differences weigh into the overall average.\n\nSo, for Class A: 20 students * (-5) = -100\n\nClass B: 30 students * 0 = 0\n\nClass C: 50 students * 5 = 250\n\nTotal difference = -100 + 0 + 250 = 150\n\nTotal students = 100\n\nSo, overall average = baseline + (total difference / total students) = 80 + (150 / 100) = 80 + 1.5 = 81.5\n\nAgain, I get 81.5. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose another baseline, say 85:\n\nClass A: 75 is -10 from 85\n\nClass B: 80 is -5 from 85\n\nClass C: 85 is 0 from 85\n\nThen,\n\nClass A: 20 * (-10) = -200\n\nClass B: 30 * (-5) = -150\n\nClass C: 50 * 0 = 0\n\nTotal difference = -200 + (-150) + 0 = -350\n\nTotal students = 100\n\nOverall average = baseline + (total difference / total students) = 85 + (-350 / 100) = 85 - 3.5 = 81.5\n\nAgain, the same result. This reinforces that 81.5 is the correct overall average.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, so I'm confident that 81.5 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{81.5} \\]"
