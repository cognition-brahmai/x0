        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and we're told that 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 8 play neither sport. We need to find out how many students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nFirst, it might help to visualize this with a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping: one circle for soccer players and another for basketball players. The overlapping area represents students who play both sports.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- S = number of students who play soccer only.\n\n- B = number of students who play basketball only.\n\n- Both = number of students who play both soccer and basketball.\n\n- Neither = number of students who play neither sport.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n- Total students = 30\n\n- Students who play soccer (S + Both) = 18\n\n- Students who play basketball (B + Both) = 20\n\n- Students who play neither = 8\n\nOur goal is to find \"Both.\"\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students play at least one of the sports. Since 8 students play neither, the number who play at least one sport is:\n\nTotal students - Neither = 30 - 8 = 22\n\nSo, 22 students play either soccer, basketball, or both.\n\nNow, if we add the number of soccer players and basketball players, we get:\n\nSoccer + Basketball = 18 + 20 = 38\n\nBut wait, this total (38) counts the students who play both sports twice\u2014once in soccer and once in basketball. So, to find the actual number of students playing at least one sport, we need to subtract the overlap (those who play both):\n\nS + B + Both = 22\n\nBut from the earlier addition, we have S + Both + B + Both = 38, which simplifies to S + B + 2*Both = 38\n\nBut we also know that S + B + Both = 22\n\nNow, we can set up equations:\n\nEquation 1: S + B + Both = 22\n\nEquation 2: S + B + 2*Both = 38\n\nIf we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:\n\n(S + B + 2*Both) - (S + B + Both) = 38 - 22\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nBoth = 16\n\nSo, 16 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nWait a minute, that seems high. Let's double-check.\n\nWe have 18 students playing soccer and 20 playing basketball, with 8 playing neither. Total students are 30.\n\nSo, students playing at least one sport: 30 - 8 = 22\n\nNow, if 18 play soccer and 20 play basketball, but only 22 play at least one sport, there must be an overlap.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|Soccer \u222a Basketball| = |Soccer| + |Basketball| - |Soccer \u2229 Basketball|\n\nWe know the union is 22, soccer is 18, basketball is 20.\n\nSo:\n\n22 = 18 + 20 - Both\n\nSolving for Both:\n\nBoth = 18 + 20 - 22 = 38 - 22 = 16\n\nYes, that's correct according to the formula.\n\nBut is it possible for 16 students to play both sports when only 18 play soccer? That would mean that almost all soccer players also play basketball.\n\nLet's verify with other perspectives.\n\nAnother way to look at it: \n\n- Total students playing soccer: 18\n\n- Total students playing basketball: 20\n\n- Total students playing at least one sport: 22\n\nIf 16 play both, then:\n\n- Soccer only: 18 - 16 = 2\n\n- Basketball only: 20 - 16 = 4\n\n- Both: 16\n\n- Neither: 8\n\nAdding soccer only, basketball only, both, and neither:\n\n2 + 4 + 16 + 8 = 30, which matches the total number of students.\n\nSo, everything adds up correctly.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play both soccer and basketball is 16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
