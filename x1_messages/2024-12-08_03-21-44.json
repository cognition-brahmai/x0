        "content": "So there's this problem here: In a room, there are 5 cats. Each cat has 6 kittens. How many legs are in the room?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, we need to figure out how many cats there are in total. There are 5 adult cats, and each of them has 6 kittens. So, the number of kittens would be 5 cats times 6 kittens per cat, which is 30 kittens.\n\nNow, adding the adult cats, the total number of cats is 5 adults plus 30 kittens, which equals 35 cats.\n\nNext, we need to consider that each cat has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs would be 35 cats times 4 legs per cat.\n\nLet me do the math: 35 times 4 is 140.\n\nWait a minute, but is that all? Is there anything else in the room that might have legs? For example, is there furniture like chairs or tables that have legs?\n\nThe problem says \"in the room,\" and it mentions cats and their kittens, but it doesn't specify anything else being in the room. So, perhaps we can assume that only the cats are in the room, and therefore, only their legs count.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe we should consider if the room has any other animals or objects with legs. However, since the problem doesn't mention anything else, it's safe to assume that only the cats and their kittens are in the room.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs in the room is 140.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Each cat has 4 legs, and there are 35 cats, so 35 times 4 is indeed 140.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
