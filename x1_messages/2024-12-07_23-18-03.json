        "content": "So I've got this limit to find: the limit as x approaches infinity of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x - 7)/(x^2 - 4). Hmm, okay, let's see how to tackle this.\n\nFirst off, when you're dealing with limits as x approaches infinity, you're essentially wanting to see what happens to the function as x gets really, really large. For rational functions like this one, where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials, there's a general rule you can follow based on the degrees of the polynomials.\n\nSo, in this case, both the numerator and the denominator are quadratic polynomials, meaning they both have degree 2. When the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are the same, the limit as x approaches infinity is equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nLet me break that down. The leading coefficient of a polynomial is the coefficient of the term with the highest power of x. For the numerator, 3x^2 + 5x - 7, the leading term is 3x^2, so the leading coefficient is 3. For the denominator, x^2 - 4, the leading term is x^2, so the leading coefficient is 1.\n\nTherefore, the limit as x approaches infinity should be 3/1, which is just 3.\n\nBut, to make sure I understand this correctly, let's think about why this is the case. When x gets really large, the higher-powered terms of x dominate the behavior of the function. So, the lower-powered terms become negligible in comparison.\n\nIn this function, both the numerator and the denominator have x^2 as their highest power. So, as x gets larger and larger, the 3x^2 in the numerator and the x^2 in the denominator will dominate, and the other terms will become less and less significant.\n\nTo visualize this, let's consider plugging in a very large value for x, say, x = 1,000,000. Then, the numerator would be 3*(1,000,000)^2 + 5*(1,000,000) - 7, which is 3,000,000,000,000 + 5,000,000 - 7 = 3,000,005,000,000 - 7 = still practically 3,000,005,000,000 since 7 is negligible.\n\nSimilarly, the denominator would be (1,000,000)^2 - 4 = 1,000,000,000,000 - 4 = 999,999,999,996. So, the fraction would be approximately 3,000,005,000,000 / 999,999,999,996, which is very close to 3.\n\nTherefore, as x approaches infinity, the function f(x) approaches 3.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider what would happen if the degrees were different. If the degree of the numerator was higher than the denominator, the limit would approach infinity. If the degree of the numerator was lower than the denominator, the limit would approach zero. But since they're the same, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the limit as x approaches infinity of (3x^2 + 5x - 7)/(x^2 - 4) is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
