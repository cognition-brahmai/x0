        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple RESTful API server in GoLang that manages book records. The books will have fields like title, author, publication year, and ISBN number, and I need to store these in memory using a slice. Sounds straightforward, but let's break it down step by step to ensure I cover all the bases.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a new Go project. I'll create a new directory for this project, say, \"book-api\", and initialize it with `go mod init book-api`. This will handle all the dependencies I might need.\n\nNext, I need to understand what a RESTful API entails. REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It's based on using HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. In this case, the resource is a \"Book\".\n\nSo, the basic CRUD operations correspond to HTTP methods:\n\n- **Create** (POST): To add a new book.\n\n- **Read** (GET): To retrieve book records, maybe all books or a specific one.\n\n- **Update** (PUT or PATCH): To update an existing book record.\n\n- **Delete** (DELETE): To remove a book record.\n\nI need to define endpoints for these operations. For simplicity, I'll assume that each book has a unique ISBN number, which I'll use as the identifier for updating and deleting.\n\nLet's start by defining the structure for a Book. In Go, this would be a struct:\n\n```go\ntype Book struct {\n    ISBN          string `json:\"isbn\"`\n    Title         string `json:\"title\"`\n    Author        string `json:\"author\"`\n    PublicationYear int    `json:\"publication_year\"`\n}\n```\n\nI'm using JSON tags to specify how the struct fields should be serialized and deserialized in JSON format, which is standard for API responses.\n\nNow, I need a place to store these books. Since the requirement is to store them in memory using a slice, I'll declare a slice of Book:\n\n```go\nvar books []Book\n```\n\nBut, in Go, slices are reference types, and to manage concurrency (since HTTP servers are concurrent by nature), I need to ensure that modifications to this slice are safe. For simplicity, I'll use a mutex to synchronize access:\n\n```go\nvar mu sync.Mutex\n```\n\nNext, I need to set up an HTTP server. Go's standard library has a built-in package for this, `net/http`. I'll create a new ServeMux and register handlers for different endpoints.\n\nLet's start with the endpoint to create a new book, which would be a POST request to `/books`.\n\nI need to write a handler function that reads the request body, unmarshals it into a Book struct, and then adds it to the books slice.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\n```go\nfunc createBook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    var newBook Book\n    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&newBook)\n    if err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n    mu.Lock()\n    books = append(books, newBook)\n    mu.Unlock()\n    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusCreated)\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(newBook)\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, for reading all books, a GET request to `/books`:\n\n```go\nfunc getBooks(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    mu.Lock()\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(books)\n    mu.Unlock()\n}\n```\n\nFor getting a single book by ISBN, a GET request to `/books/{isbn}`:\n\n```go\nfunc getBook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    isbn := chi.URLParam(r, \"isbn\")\n    mu.Lock()\n    for _, book := range books {\n        if book.ISBN == isbn {\n            mu.Unlock()\n            json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(book)\n            return\n        }\n    }\n    mu.Unlock()\n    http.Error(w, \"Book not found\", http.StatusNotFound)\n}\n```\n\nHere, I'm assuming I'm using the \"github.com/go-chi/chi\" package for routing, which makes it easy to capture URL parameters.\n\nFor updating a book, a PUT request to `/books/{isbn}`:\n\n```go\nfunc updateBook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    isbn := chi.URLParam(r, \"isbn\")\n    var updatedBook Book\n    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&updatedBook)\n    if err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n    mu.Lock()\n    for i, book := range books {\n        if book.ISBN == isbn {\n            books[i] = updatedBook\n            mu.Unlock()\n            json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(updatedBook)\n            return\n        }\n    }\n    mu.Unlock()\n    http.Error(w, \"Book not found\", http.StatusNotFound)\n}\n```\n\nAnd for deleting a book, a DELETE request to `/books/{isbn}`:\n\n```go\nfunc deleteBook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    isbn := chi.URLParam(r, \"isbn\")\n    mu.Lock()\n    for i, book := range books {\n        if book.ISBN == isbn {\n            books = append(books[:i], books[i+1:]...)\n            mu.Unlock()\n            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNoContent)\n            return\n        }\n    }\n    mu.Unlock()\n    http.Error(w, \"Book not found\", http.StatusNotFound)\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to set up the routes. For this, I'll use the Chi package, which is a popular router for Go. First, I need to add it as a dependency:\n\n```sh\ngo get github.com/go-chi/chi\n```\n\nThen, in my code:\n\n```go\nr := chi.NewRouter()\nr.Post(\"/books\", createBook)\nr.Get(\"/books\", getBooks)\nr.Get(\"/books/{isbn}\", getBook)\nr.Put(\"/books/{isbn}\", updateBook)\nr.Delete(\"/books/{isbn}\", deleteBook)\nlog.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", r))\n```\n\nThis sets up the router with the appropriate handlers for each endpoint.\n\nI should also consider error handling and ensuring that the ISBN is unique before adding a new book. For example, in the createBook function, I could check if a book with the same ISBN already exists and return an appropriate error if it does.\n\nAdditionally, for the update and delete operations, I need to make sure that the ISBN provided in the URL matches the one in the request body, but since I'm using the URL parameter as the identifier, I can assume it's correct.\n\nFor better practice, I might want to return the updated or deleted book in the response, but according to REST principles, a DELETE request should return 204 No Content if successful.\n\nAlso, storing everything in memory is fine for this simple example, but in a real-world scenario, I'd want to persist the data to a database.\n\nLastly, I should think about testing this API. Go has built-in testing capabilities, and there are libraries like testify for writing assertions. I could write tests for each endpoint to ensure they behave as expected.\n\nIn summary, here's the plan:\n\n1. Set up a new Go module.\n\n2. Define the Book struct with appropriate JSON tags.\n\n3. Use a slice to store books in memory and a mutex for concurrency safety.\n\n4. Set up an HTTP server using Chi for routing.\n\n5. Implement handlers for CRUD operations:\n\n- POST /books: Create a new book.\n\n- GET /books: Retrieve all books.\n\n- GET /books/{isbn}: Retrieve a specific book by ISBN.\n\n- PUT /books/{isbn}: Update a book by ISBN.\n\n- DELETE /books/{isbn}: Delete a book by ISBN.\n\n6. Ensure proper error handling and uniqueness of ISBN.\n\n7. Run the server on a specified port, e.g., 8080.\n\nThis should give me a simple, functional RESTful API for managing book records."
