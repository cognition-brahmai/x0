        "content": "The largest moon of Jupiter, discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, is called Ganymede. It's not only the largest moon in our solar system but also larger than the planet Mercury. Ganymede is one of the four Galilean moons, which also include Io, Europa, and Callisto. These moons were among the first telescopic discoveries and played a crucial role in supporting the heliocentric model of the solar system."
