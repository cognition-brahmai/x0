        "content": "So the company has 120 employees, and they want to form teams with exactly 8 members each for a team-building activity. We need to figure out how many full teams can be formed and if there are any employees left without a team.\n\nFirst, I think we should divide the total number of employees by the number of members per team. So, that's 120 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do the division: 120 \u00f7 8.\n\n8 times 15 is 120, so 15 teams can be formed.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's any remainder. Let's see: 8 multiplied by 15 equals 120, so 15 teams can be formed with no one left out.\n\nBut the question asks for how many teams can be formed and how many employees will be left without a team.\n\nSo, based on the division, 15 teams can be formed, and since 8 times 15 is exactly 120, there are no employees left without a team.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it in terms of multiplication. If each team has 8 members, then 15 teams would have 15 times 8, which is 120 employees.\n\nSo, all employees are accommodated in the teams, with no one left out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that 15 teams can be formed, and 0 employees will be left without a team.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I should double-check this. Sometimes when dividing, there can be remainders, but in this case, it seems to divide evenly.\n\nLet me confirm: 8 times 15 is 120, so yes, it's exact.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it differently, perhaps using subtraction. Start with 120 employees, and keep subtracting 8 until I reach zero.\n\n120 minus 8 is 112, that's one team.\n\n112 minus 8 is 104, that's two teams.\n\nContinuing this way:\n\n104 - 8 = 96, three teams.\n\n96 - 8 = 88, four teams.\n\n88 - 8 = 80, five teams.\n\n80 - 8 = 72, six teams.\n\n72 - 8 = 64, seven teams.\n\n64 - 8 = 56, eight teams.\n\n56 - 8 = 48, nine teams.\n\n48 - 8 = 40, ten teams.\n\n40 - 8 = 32, eleven teams.\n\n32 - 8 = 24, twelve teams.\n\n24 - 8 = 16, thirteen teams.\n\n16 - 8 = 8, fourteen teams.\n\n8 - 8 = 0, fifteen teams.\n\nAnd again, no one is left out.\n\nSo, my initial answer seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the number of teams is the quotient of the division of 120 by 8, and the number of leftover employees is the remainder.\n\nIn mathematical terms, 120 divided by 8 is 15 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, teams = 15, leftover employees = 0.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using modular arithmetic. 120 modulo 8 is 0, which means there's no remainder.\n\nTherefore, 15 teams can be formed, and 0 employees are left without a team.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ teams, } 0 \\text{ employees left}} \\]"
