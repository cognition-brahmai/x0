        "content": "In music theory, the \"natural\" minor scale is considered to be the Aeolian mode. So, the correct answer is C. Aeolian mode.\n\nTo provide some more context, let's briefly look at each option:\n\nA. Harmonic minor scale: This is a type of minor scale that differs from the natural minor by having a raised seventh degree. This alteration is done to create a stronger leading tone back to the tonic.\n\nB. Major scale: This is the most common scale in Western music and is considered the \"natural\" scale in that context. It has a specific whole-step and half-step pattern that defines its sound.\n\nC. Aeolian mode: This is one of the seven modes of the major scale and is essentially the natural minor scale. It has a distinct sound characterized by its minor third and minor seventh intervals in relation to the tonic.\n\nD. Dorian mode: This is another mode of the major scale and is often referred to as the \"natural\" minor scale's brother because it also has a minor feel but with a raised sixth degree compared to the natural minor.\n\nSo, in summary, when we talk about the \"natural\" minor scale, we're referring to the Aeolian mode, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
