Mahatma Gandhi was not primarily known as a mathematician, nor did he guide India towards technological progress through peaceful methods, although he was a major leader in India's independence movement using non-violent civil disobedience. His full name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and he is revered in India as the father of the nation. He played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence from British rule.\n\nAs for his death, Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, not February 28, 1950, due to political reasons related to his views on religious harmony and the partition of India.\n\nI suggest you verify your sources for accurate information.\n\nENDINPUT\n"
