        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 50 houses, and each house has either a blue or a red door. The key point here is that no two neighboring houses have the same color doors. That means if one house has a blue door, the next one must have a red door, and vice versa.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this setup. Imagine the houses are arranged in a row, each next to the other. Starting from one end, the door colors alternate: blue, red, blue, red, and so on.\n\nNow, the question is, how many houses have blue doors?\n\nSince the doors alternate in color, the pattern repeats every two houses: blue and red.\n\nSo, in every pair of two houses, there is one blue door and one red door.\n\nGiven that there are 50 houses in total, I can divide the total number of houses by 2 to find out how many pairs there are.\n\n50 houses \u00f7 2 = 25 pairs.\n\nSince each pair contains one blue door, the total number of blue doors should be equal to the number of pairs.\n\nTherefore, there are 25 blue doors.\n\nWait a minute, is this correct? Let me double-check.\n\nIf I have 50 houses, and the doors alternate in color, starting with blue, the sequence would be: blue, red, blue, red, ..., and so on, up to the 50th house.\n\nIn this case, the first house has a blue door, the second has a red door, the third has a blue door, and so on.\n\nSo, for an even number of houses, like 50, the number of blue doors should be equal to the number of red doors.\n\nHence, 50 houses / 2 = 25 blue doors and 25 red doors.\n\nBut, let's consider another scenario. What if the first house has a red door instead of blue?\n\nThen the sequence would be: red, blue, red, blue, ..., and so on.\n\nAgain, in every pair of two houses, there is one red and one blue door.\n\nSo, regardless of whether the first house has a blue or red door, the total number of blue doors should still be 25 in a set of 50 houses.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 25 houses have blue doors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
