        "content": "Yes, humans are born with nearly all the brain cells they will ever have. At birth, an infant's brain contains about 100 billion neurons, which is roughly the same number as in an adult brain. Throughout life, the number of neurons remains relatively stable, although some neurons can be lost due to injury, disease, or normal aging processes. However, the brain continues to change and adapt through a process called neuroplasticity, where existing neurons form new connections and strengthen existing ones in response to learning and experience."
