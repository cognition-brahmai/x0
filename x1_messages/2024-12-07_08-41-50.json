        "content": "Let's see. The company produces 500 units of product X each day, and it costs them $20 to make each unit. They sell each unit for $30. I need to find out what their daily profit is.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total cost of producing the 500 units. Since each unit costs $20 to make, I can multiply the number of units by the cost per unit to get the total cost.\n\nTotal cost = number of units \u00d7 cost per unit\nTotal cost = 500 \u00d7 $20\nTotal cost = $10,000\n\nSo, the company spends $10,000 each day to produce the 500 units.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total revenue from selling these 500 units. They sell each unit for $30, so again, I'll multiply the number of units by the selling price per unit.\n\nTotal revenue = number of units \u00d7 selling price per unit\nTotal revenue = 500 \u00d7 $30\nTotal revenue = $15,000\n\nSo, the company earns $15,000 from selling the 500 units each day.\n\nNow, to find the daily profit, I need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue.\n\nProfit = total revenue - total cost\nProfit = $15,000 - $10,000\nProfit = $5,000\n\nTherefore, the company's daily profit is $5,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any other costs involved, like overheads or expenses? The question only mentions the production cost per unit and the selling price per unit, so I think this is sufficient.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe calculating the profit per unit first and then multiplying by the number of units.\n\nProfit per unit = selling price per unit - cost per unit\nProfit per unit = $30 - $20\nProfit per unit = $10\n\nThen, total daily profit = profit per unit \u00d7 number of units\nTotal daily profit = $10 \u00d7 500\nTotal daily profit = $5,000\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation, so I'm confident that $5,000 is the correct daily profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5000} \\]"
