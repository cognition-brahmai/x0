        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: there are about 50 million bacteria in a petri dish, and they double every 20 minutes. I need to figure out how many there will be after 1 hour. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked.\n\nSo, I start with 50 million bacteria. That's 50,000,000. And every 20 minutes, the number doubles. I need to know the amount after 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, how many times do the bacteria double in 60 minutes?\n\nWell, 60 minutes divided by 20 minutes per doubling is 3. So, they double 3 times in an hour. That makes sense.\n\nNow, if I have an initial amount and it doubles once, that's multiplied by 2. If it doubles twice, that's multiplied by 2 twice, which is 2 to the power of 2. So, for 3 doublings, it should be the initial amount multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 3.\n\nWait, let me write that down to make sure I'm getting this right.\n\nInitial amount: 50,000,000\n\nAfter first doubling (20 minutes): 50,000,000 * 2 = 100,000,000\n\nAfter second doubling (40 minutes): 100,000,000 * 2 = 200,000,000\n\nAfter third doubling (60 minutes): 200,000,000 * 2 = 400,000,000\n\nSo, after 1 hour, there would be 400,000,000 bacteria.\n\nBut let me check if there's a formula for this. I recall that exponential growth can be modeled by the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (growth rate)^(time / doubling time)\n\nIn this case, the growth rate is 2, since it doubles, and the doubling time is 20 minutes. The time is 60 minutes.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nFinal amount = 50,000,000 * 2^(60/20) = 50,000,000 * 2^3 = 50,000,000 * 8 = 400,000,000\n\nYeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nWait a second, but I remember that in some cases, exponential growth is modeled differently, with a base e and all that. Should I be using that here?\n\nLet me think. The general exponential growth formula is:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * e^(k * t)\n\nWhere k is the growth rate and t is time.\n\nBut in this case, since we're given a doubling time, using the doubling formula seems more straightforward.\n\nMoreover, in the context of bacteria doubling every certain period, the doubling time formula is appropriately applied.\n\nSo, I think sticking with the doubling time formula is fine here.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can calculate it using the continuous growth formula and see if I get the same result.\n\nFirst, I need to find the growth rate k.\n\nWe know that the doubling time T is related to k by the equation:\n\nT = ln(2) / k\n\nSo, k = ln(2) / T\n\nHere, T is 20 minutes.\n\nSo, k = ln(2) / 20\n\nNow, for t = 60 minutes, the final amount would be:\n\nFinal amount = 50,000,000 * e^(k * 60) = 50,000,000 * e^( (ln(2)/20) * 60 ) = 50,000,000 * e^( (ln(2) * 3) ) = 50,000,000 * e^(ln(8)) = 50,000,000 * 8 = 400,000,000\n\nAgain, the same result. So, regardless of the method, I end up with 400,000,000 bacteria after 1 hour.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors I should account for. For example, is there a limit to how many bacteria can be in the petri dish? Is there enough space and nutrients for such exponential growth?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any constraints, so I'll assume unlimited resources for this scenario.\n\nAlso, the initial count is approximate, but since we're dealing with exponents, even small differences in the initial count would be amplified greatly.\n\nBut for the sake of this problem, using 50,000,000 as the starting number should be fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the doubling time remains constant throughout the hour. If there are any changes in environment or other factors, the doubling time might change. But again, the problem doesn't specify any changes, so I'll assume the doubling time stays constant.\n\nSo, to summarize, starting with 50,000,000 bacteria, doubling every 20 minutes for 60 minutes, results in 400,000,000 bacteria.\n\nAlternatively, in scientific notation, that's 4 x 10^8 bacteria.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to be extra sure, maybe I can try calculating it differently.\n\nLet's see, another way to look at exponential growth is to use the rule of doubling times. Every 20 minutes, the number doubles.\n\nSo, after 20 minutes: 50,000,000 * 2 = 100,000,000\n\nAfter 40 minutes: 100,000,000 * 2 = 200,000,000\n\nAfter 60 minutes: 200,000,000 * 2 = 400,000,000\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of the number of doublings, which is 3 in this case, the factor by which the population increases is 2^3 = 8.\n\nSo, 50,000,000 * 8 = 400,000,000\n\nConsistent across multiple methods, so I'm confident with this answer.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Perhaps expressing it in terms of powers of 2.\n\nStarting amount: 50,000,000 = 5 x 10^7\n\nAfter 1 doubling: 5 x 10^7 * 2^1 = 10 x 10^7 = 100,000,000\n\nAfter 2 doublings: 5 x 10^7 * 2^2 = 20 x 10^7 = 200,000,000\n\nAfter 3 doublings: 5 x 10^7 * 2^3 = 40 x 10^7 = 400,000,000\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 400,000,000 bacteria after 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400000000} \\]"
