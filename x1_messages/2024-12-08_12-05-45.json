        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are people in a room who speak different languages: 4 English, 3 French, and 2 Spanish. So, total number of people is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 people.\n\nWe need to select 3 people randomly from these 9, and we want to find the probability that all three speak different languages. That means one speaks English, one speaks French, and one speaks Spanish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to approach this. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select 3 people out of 9 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nHere, n = 9 and k = 3.\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * (9 - 3)!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84.\n\nSo, there are 84 possible ways to choose any 3 people from the room.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, we need one person from each language group. So, one English, one French, and one Spanish speaker.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one English speaker from 4 is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nSimilarly, number of ways to choose one French speaker from 3 is C(3, 1) = 3.\n\nAnd number of ways to choose one Spanish speaker from 2 is C(2, 1) = 2.\n\nSince these choices are independent, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices:\n\n4 (English) * 3 (French) * 2 (Spanish) = 24.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes:\n\nProbability = 24 / 84 = 2 / 7.\n\nWait, can I simplify that fraction? 24 and 84 are both divisible by 12.\n\n24 \u00f7 12 = 2\n\n84 \u00f7 12 = 7\n\nSo, yes, 2/7 is the simplified form.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of permutations. The order in which we select the people doesn't matter because it's a group, so combinations are the way to go.\n\nAnother way is to think about the probability step by step.\n\nFirst, pick any person. The probability that the first person speaks English is 4/9.\n\nThen, the probability that the second person speaks French is 3/8 (since one person has already been chosen).\n\nFinally, the probability that the third person speaks Spanish is 2/7.\n\nSo, the probability would be (4/9) * (3/8) * (2/7).\n\nBut wait, that's 4 * 3 * 2 / (9 * 8 * 7) = 24 / 504 = 1/21.\n\nHmm, that's different from 2/7. What's going on here?\n\nOh, I see. In this approach, the order matters because I'm picking one after another. But in the group, order doesn't matter. So, I need to account for all the different orders in which I can pick one from each language.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 different orders: EFS, ESE, FES, FSE, SEF, SFE.\n\nWait, but actually, since all three are different, it's 3! = 6 ways.\n\nSo, the total probability would be 6 * (4/9 * 3/8 * 2/7) = 6 * (24/504) = 6 * (1/21) = 6/21 = 2/7.\n\nAh, that matches the earlier answer.\n\nSo, whether I use combinations or permutations, I end up with the same answer of 2/7.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I consider the total number of ways to choose one from each language group, which is 4 * 3 * 2 = 24, as before.\n\nAnd the total number of ways to choose any 3 people from 9 is C(9, 3) = 84.\n\nSo, probability is 24/84 = 2/7.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the first person speaks English is 4/9.\n\nGiven that the first speaks English, the probability that the second speaks French is 3/8.\n\nGiven that the first speaks English and the second speaks French, the probability that the third speaks Spanish is 2/7.\n\nSo, the probability is (4/9) * (3/8) * (2/7) = 24/504 = 1/21.\n\nBut as before, since the order doesn't matter, I need to multiply by the number of orders, which is 6, giving 6/21 = 2/7.\n\nAll these methods lead me back to 2/7.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing.\n\nIs there any overlap or any restriction I haven't accounted for?\n\nThe problem says there are 4 English speakers, 3 French, and 2 Spanish, and these are distinct groups. It doesn't say if anyone speaks more than one language, but I'll assume that\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u53ea\u8bf4\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u8bf4\u660e\u6709\u4eba\u5927\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\nTherefore, the probability that all three people in the group speak different languages is 2/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{7}} \\]"
