        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells apples in bags, and each bag contains 6 apples. They sell 200 of these bags every day. We want to find out how many individual apples they sell in a month, assuming there are 30 days in that month.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many apples are sold each day. Since each bag has 6 apples and they sell 200 bags per day, I can multiply the number of bags by the number of apples per bag to get the daily apple sales.\n\nSo, apples per day = number of bags per day \u00d7 apples per bag\n\nThat would be:\n\napples per day = 200 bags \u00d7 6 apples/bag = 1200 apples per day\n\nNow, to find out how many apples are sold in a month, I need to multiply the daily apple sales by the number of days in the month. Assuming the month has 30 days:\n\napples per month = apples per day \u00d7 number of days in the month\n\napples per month = 1200 apples/day \u00d7 30 days = 36,000 apples\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way could be to first find out the total number of bags sold in a month and then multiply by the number of apples per bag.\n\nTotal bags per month = bags per day \u00d7 number of days in the month\n\nTotal bags per month = 200 bags/day \u00d7 30 days = 6,000 bags\n\nThen, total apples per month = total bags per month \u00d7 apples per bag\n\ntotal apples per month = 6,000 bags \u00d7 6 apples/bag = 36,000 apples\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 36,000 apples per month.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. The problem seems straightforward: consistent daily sales and a fixed number of days in the month. No mention of weekends, holidays, or changes in sales volume, so I don't think I need to adjust for anything else.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the units to make sure they make sense.\n\n- Bags per day: 200 bags/day\n\n- Apples per bag: 6 apples/bag\n\n- Days per month: 30 days\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n(200 bags/day) \u00d7 (6 apples/bag) \u00d7 (30 days) = 36,000 apples\n\nThe units work out correctly, as \"bags per day\" and \"apples per bag\" combine to give \"apples per day,\" and then multiplying by \"days\" gives \"apples.\"\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The store sells 36,000 individual apples in a month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36000} \\]"
