        "content": "Let's see. If a car consumes 1 gallon of gas every 20 miles, and I want to drive 300 miles, I need to figure out how many gallons of gas I'll need for that trip. Then, I can multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of gallons needed. Since the car uses 1 gallon every 20 miles, for 300 miles, I can divide 300 by 20 to find out how many gallons are required.\n\n300 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 15 gallons\n\nSo, I need 15 gallons of gas for the trip.\n\nNow, if the price of gas is $3.50 per gallon, I can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon.\n\n15 gallons \u00d7 $3.50 per gallon = $52.50\n\nTherefore, the total cost of gas for the 300-mile trip would be $52.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52.50} \\]"
