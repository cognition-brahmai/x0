        "content": "Implementing a function in Golang to reverse a string without using any built-in functions or libraries is an interesting exercise. It helps to understand string manipulation at a lower level. In Go, strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed directly. Therefore, to reverse a string, we need to convert it into a slice of runes (to handle multi-byte characters correctly), manipulate the slice, and then convert it back to a string.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Convert the string to a slice of runes**: This is necessary to handle characters that may be represented by multiple bytes, ensuring that the function works correctly with Unicode characters.\n\n2. **Reverse the slice**: We can do this by swapping runes from the start and end of the slice, moving towards the center.\n\n3. **Convert the slice back to a string**: After reversing the slice, convert it back to a string to get the reversed version.\n\nBelow is the implementation of this approach:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc reverseString(s string) string {\n\t// Convert string to slice of runes to handle multi-byte characters\n\trunes := []rune(s)\n\t// Reverse the slice of runes\n\tfor i, j := 0, len(runes)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {\n\t\trunes[i], runes[j] = runes[j], runes[i]\n\t}\n\t// Convert the slice of runes back to a string\n\treturn string(runes)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Test the function\n\tinput := \"hello\"\n\treversed := reverseString(input)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Original:\", input)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Reversed:\", reversed)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Conversion to Rune Slice**: By converting the string to a slice of runes, we ensure that each rune represents a valid Unicode code point, which is crucial for correctly handling and reversing strings with multi-byte characters.\n\n2. **Reversing the Slice**: We use a two-pointer technique where one pointer starts at the beginning of the slice and the other at the end. We swap the runes at these pointers and move them towards the center until they meet or cross each other.\n\n3. **Conversion Back to String**: After the slice has been reversed, we convert it back to a string using the `string()` function, which interprets the slice of runes as a sequence of Unicode code points and constructs the corresponding string.\n\nThis method is efficient and straightforward, providing a correct reversal of strings including those with special characters or non-ASCII characters.\n"
