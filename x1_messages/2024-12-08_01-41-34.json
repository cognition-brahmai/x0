        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 500 units of a product per day. Now, they're facing increased demand, and they decide to ramp up production by 20% each week for the next three weeks. We need to find out how many total units will be produced over these three weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have weekly increases in production, but the production is daily. So, I should probably figure out the daily production for each week and then calculate the total units produced each week, finally summing them up for the three weeks.\n\nLet's start by noting that there are 7 days in a week, so normally, without any increases, the weekly production would be 500 units/day * 7 days/week = 3500 units/week.\n\nBut production increases by 20% each week. So, each week's production is 20% more than the previous week's.\n\nLet me denote the initial daily production as P0 = 500 units/day.\n\nThen, each week, the daily production increases by 20%, so:\n\nWeek 1 daily production: P1 = P0 * 1.20\n\nWeek 2 daily production: P2 = P1 * 1.20 = P0 * (1.20)^2\n\nWeek 3 daily production: P3 = P2 * 1.20 = P0 * (1.20)^3\n\nNow, the total units produced each week would be the daily production multiplied by 7 days.\n\nSo, total units for each week:\n\nWeek 1: T1 = P1 * 7 = P0 * 1.20 * 7\n\nWeek 2: T2 = P2 * 7 = P0 * (1.20)^2 * 7\n\nWeek 3: T3 = P3 * 7 = P0 * (1.20)^3 * 7\n\nFinally, the total units over the three weeks would be T1 + T2 + T3.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, P0 = 500 units/day.\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = 500 * 1.20 * 7\n\nT2 = 500 * (1.20)^2 * 7\n\nT3 = 500 * (1.20)^3 * 7\n\nLet me calculate each term separately.\n\nFirst, calculate the multiplication factors:\n\n1.20^1 = 1.20\n\n1.20^2 = 1.44\n\n1.20^3 = 1.728\n\nNow,\n\nT1 = 500 * 1.20 * 7 = 500 * 8.4 = 4200 units\n\nT2 = 500 * 1.44 * 7 = 500 * 10.08 = 5040 units\n\nT3 = 500 * 1.728 * 7 = 500 * 12.096 = 6048 units\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\nTotal units = T1 + T2 + T3 = 4200 + 5040 + 6048\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n4200 + 5040 = 9240\n\n9240 + 6048 = 15288 units\n\nSo, the total units produced over the three weeks is 15,288 units.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, daily production increases by 20% each week.\n\nStarting with 500 units/day.\n\nWeek 1 daily production: 500 * 1.20 = 600 units/day\n\nWeek 2 daily production: 600 * 1.20 = 720 units/day\n\nWeek 3 daily production: 720 * 1.20 = 864 units/day\n\nNow, weekly production:\n\nWeek 1: 600 * 7 = 4200 units\n\nWeek 2: 720 * 7 = 5040 units\n\nWeek 3: 864 * 7 = 6048 units\n\nTotal: 4200 + 5040 + 6048 = 15,288 units\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a geometric series.\n\nThe total production over three weeks can be expressed as:\n\nTotal = P0 * 7 * (1.20^1 + 1.20^2 + 1.20^3)\n\nWhich is P0 * 7 * 1.20 * (1 + 1.20 + 1.20^2)\n\nWait, actually, let's recall the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of a geometric series is S = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a = P0 * 1.20 * 7, r = 1.20, n = 3.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal = P0 * 7 * 1.20 * (1.20^3 - 1)/(1.20 - 1)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1.20^3 = 1.728\n\nSo, (1.728 - 1) = 0.728\n\nDenominator: 1.20 - 1 = 0.20\n\nSo, S = 500 * 7 * 1.20 * (0.728)/0.20\n\nFirst, 500 * 7 = 3500\n\n3500 * 1.20 = 4200\n\n4200 * 0.728 = 3057.6\n\nThen, 3057.6 / 0.20 = 15,288 units\n\nSame result as before, so it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have factored it differently, but I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the total units produced over the three weeks is 15,288 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15288} \\]"
