        "content": "To calculate the total profit generated by selling all produced units in one month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the daily profit from selling product A.\n2. Multiply the daily profit by the number of days in the month to get the monthly profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the daily profit. The daily profit is calculated by subtracting the total daily production cost from the total daily revenue.\n\nThe total daily revenue is the number of units produced per day multiplied by the selling price per unit. So, that's 500 units/day * $25/unit = $12,500/day.\n\nThe total daily production cost is the number of units produced per day multiplied by the production cost per unit. So, that's 500 units/day * $12/unit = $6,000/day.\n\nTherefore, the daily profit is $12,500/day - $6,000/day = $6,500/day.\n\nNext, to find the monthly profit, we multiply the daily profit by the number of days in the month. Assuming the month has 30 days, the monthly profit would be $6,500/day * 30 days = $195,000.\n\nSo, the total profit generated by selling all produced units in one month is $195,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{195000} \\]"
