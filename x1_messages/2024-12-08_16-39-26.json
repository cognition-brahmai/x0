        "content": "So, let's see here. I've got this basketball player who scores an average of 25 points per game over a season of 82 games. And the question is, how many more points would they have scored if their average was 30 points per game instead.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many points they actually scored with the 25 points per game average. That should be straightforward. I just multiply the average by the number of games, right?\n\nSo, 25 points per game times 82 games equals... let's see, 25 times 80 is 2000, and 25 times 2 is 50, so total is 2050 points.\n\nNow, if their average was 30 points per game, I need to calculate what their total points would be in that case.\n\nSo, 30 points per game times 82 games equals... 30 times 80 is 2400, and 30 times 2 is 60, so that's 2460 points.\n\nNext, to find out how many more points that would be, I subtract the original total points from this new total.\n\nSo, 2460 minus 2050 equals 410 points.\n\nTherefore, if the player had an average of 30 points per game instead of 25, they would have scored 410 more points over the season.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nOriginal total: 25 times 82.\n\n25 times 80 is 2000, 25 times 2 is 50, so 2050 points.\n\nNew total: 30 times 82.\n\n30 times 80 is 2400, 30 times 2 is 60, so 2460 points.\n\nSubtracting: 2460 minus 2050 is indeed 410 points.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the difference in average per game and then multiply by the number of games.\n\nSo, the difference in average is 30 minus 25, which is 5 points per game.\n\nThen, over 82 games, that would be 5 times 82, which is 410 points.\n\nSame answer as before, which reinforces that 410 is the correct additional points.\n\nSo, the player would have scored 410 more points if their average was 30 points per game instead of 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{410} \\]"
