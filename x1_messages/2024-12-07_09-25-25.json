        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with different colored balls: 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green. I need to find the probability of picking a red ball at random. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the bag.\n\nSo, the formula for probability is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Red Balls}}{\\text{Total Number of Balls}} \\]\n\nNow, from the problem, I know there are 5 red balls. To find the total number of balls, I need to add up all the balls of different colors:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Balls} = \\text{Red} + \\text{Blue} + \\text{Green} = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of balls is 10.\n\nPlugging these numbers into the probability formula:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. 5 red balls out of 10 total balls should indeed be \\(\\frac{5}{10}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) or 0.5.\n\nBut probabilities are often expressed as decimals or percentages. So, 0.5 is the same as 50%. That means there's a 50% chance of picking a red ball.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using combinations. The number of ways to choose one red ball from five is \\( C(5,1) \\), and the total number of ways to choose any one ball from ten is \\( C(10,1) \\).\n\nSo, \\( C(5,1) = 5 \\) and \\( C(10,1) = 10 \\), so the probability is again \\( \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems like the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, is the picking random? The problem says \"randomly pick one ball,\" so yes, it's a random selection. Are there any replacements or multiple picks? No, it's just one pick, so that's straightforward.\n\nAlso, ensuring that all balls are identical except for color, as per standard probability assumptions, unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all the bases here. The probability of picking a red ball is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
