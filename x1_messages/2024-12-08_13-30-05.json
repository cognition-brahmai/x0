        "content": "Carnivorous plants have adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, and they supplement their nutrient intake by capturing and digesting insects and other small animals. However, this doesn't mean they will die if they don't catch insects. These plants still perform photosynthesis like other plants and can obtain some nutrients from the soil, albeit in limited quantities.\n\nIn natural settings, carnivorous plants can go for extended periods without catching insects, especially during unfavorable conditions such as winter dormancy. In controlled environments like greenhouses or as houseplants, they can survive on the nutrients provided through the soil and the energy from sunlight.\n\nThat being said, regular insect consumption can enhance their growth and overall health, making them more resilient to diseases and environmental stresses. So while they won't die immediately without insects, a steady supply can be beneficial for their long-term well-being.\n\n**Note:** It's important to ensure that carnivorous plants are not overfed with insects, as this can also be harmful. Their natural diet is typically small insects, and overfeeding can lead to damage to their trapping mechanisms or even rotting."
