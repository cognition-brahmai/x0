        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing football and basketball, and I need to figure out how many students don't play either game. Let's see what I've got.\n\nThere are 40 students in total. Out of these, 12 play football, 18 play basketball, and 5 play both games. I need to find out how many don't play either.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm pretty sure there's a formula for this.\n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion. It's used when we have overlapping sets. The formula for two sets is:\n\nTotal = A + B - A \u2229 B + neither\n\nWait, in this case, A is the number of students playing football, B is the number playing basketball, and A \u2229 B is the number playing both.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal students = students playing football + students playing basketball - students playing both + students playing neither.\n\nSo, 40 = 12 + 18 - 5 + neither.\n\nLet me do the math here. 12 plus 18 is 30, minus 5 is 25, and then 25 plus neither equals 40.\n\nSo, neither = 40 - 25 = 15.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can think about the number of students playing at least one game. That would be those playing football or basketball or both.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle again:\n\nStudents playing at least one game = football + basketball - both.\n\nSo, that's 12 + 18 - 5 = 25.\n\nThen, the number not playing any game would be total students minus those playing at least one game.\n\nSo, 40 - 25 = 15.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me try to visualize this with a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents football players, the other represents basketball players.\n\nThe football circle has 12 students, but within that, 5 also play basketball.\n\nSimilarly, the basketball circle has 18 students, but again, 5 play both.\n\nSo, only football players are 12 - 5 = 7.\n\nOnly basketball players are 18 - 5 = 13.\n\nThen, both are 5.\n\nSo, total students playing at least one game are 7 + 13 + 5 = 25.\n\nAgain, total students is 40, so 40 - 25 = 15 don't play either.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nLet me consider if there's any student counted more than once or if there's any restriction I'm missing.\n\nOh, in the Venn diagram approach, I explicitly separated those who play only football, only basketball, and both, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use probabilities or something, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of subsets.\n\nLet me define set F as football players, set B as basketball players.\n\nWe know:\n\nn(F) = 12\n\nn(B) = 18\n\nn(F \u2229 B) = 5\n\nWe need to find n(neither), where total students are 40.\n\nFrom set theory, n(F \u222a B) = n(F) + n(B) - n(F \u2229 B) = 12 + 18 - 5 = 25.\n\nThen, n(neither) = total students - n(F \u222a B) = 40 - 25 = 15.\n\nOkay, this keeps confirming the same answer.\n\nLet me think if there's any other approach to double-check.\n\nSuppose I make a table:\n\nCategories:\n\n- Play football only: 12 - 5 = 7\n\n- Play basketball only: 18 - 5 = 13\n\n- Play both: 5\n\n- Play neither: ?\n\nTotal students: 40\n\nSo, play neither = 40 - (7 + 13 + 5) = 40 - 25 = 15.\n\nAgain, 15 students don't play either game.\n\nI think this is solid. I've used multiple methods to arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility of students playing other games or some constraint I haven't considered.\n\nThe problem says \"play football\", \"play basketball\", and \"play both games\", and asks for students who don't play either game.\n\nAssuming that \"both\" means both football and basketball, and there are no other games involved here.\n\nSo, I think 15 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
