        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple chat client in Java that connects to a remote server using WebSocket. The client should let users send and receive messages in real-time. I'm not super familiar with WebSockets in Java, but I've done some networking before, so I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what WebSockets are. From what I know, WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. That means both the client and server can send data to each other at any time, which is perfect for real-time chat.\n\nI need to choose a Java library that supports WebSockets. After a quick search, I see that there are a few options like Java API for WebSocket, Tyrus, and even support in higher-level frameworks like Spring. Since I want something straightforward and without too much overhead, I think Java API for WebSocket should suffice.\n\nWait, actually, Java API for WebSocket is more geared towards creating WebSocket servers. For a client, I should look into Tyrus, which is the reference implementation of the Java API for WebSocket and also provides client APIs.\n\nSo, I'll go with Tyrus for this task. I need to include it in my project. Since I'm comfortable with Maven, I'll add the Tyrus client dependency to my pom.xml.\n\nLet me look up the latest version of Tyrus. As of now, the latest version is x.x.x. So, I'll add that to my pom.xml.\n\nNow, I need to think about the structure of my chat client. It should be able to connect to a remote WebSocket server, send messages, and receive messages in real-time.\n\nI should probably create a class that represents the chat client. It should have methods to connect to the server, send messages, and handle incoming messages.\n\nAlso, since WebSockets are event-driven, I need to set up event handlers for when a message is received, when the connection is established, when it's closed, etc.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the class:\n\n- ChatClient class\n\n- Fields:\n\n- WebSocketContainer\n\n- Session\n\n- Constructors:\n\n- Initialize WebSocketContainer\n\n- Methods:\n\n- connect(String url): connects to the server\n\n- sendMessage(String message): sends a message to the server\n\n- onClose(CloseReason closeReason): handles connection closure\n\n- onError(Throwable cause): handles errors\n\n- onMessage(String message): handles incoming messages\n\nWait, actually, in Tyrus, I think I need to implement a Endpoint class and set up event handlers within it.\n\nLet me look up some Tyrus client examples.\n\nOkay, from the Tyrus documentation, I see that for client applications, I can create a ClientEndpoint class that annotates a class with @ClientEndpoint and defines methods annotated with @OnOpen, @OnClose, @OnError, and @OnMessage to handle respective events.\n\nSo, perhaps I should create a class annotated with @ClientEndpoint and define these callback methods.\n\nBut I also need to have a way for the user to send messages. So, maybe I'll need to store a reference to the Session object established by the WebSocket connection, and then use that Session to send messages.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The Session object has a method called sendMessage() that can be used to send messages to the server.\n\nSo, in my ChatClient class, I'll need to hold a reference to this Session once the connection is open.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the ChatClient class is thread-safe because WebSocket events can be delivered on different threads.\n\nHmm, Tyrus should handle the threading, but I need to be cautious when accessing shared resources.\n\nNow, for the user interface, since it's a simple chat client, I'll keep it command-line based for simplicity.\n\nSo, when the program starts, it should prompt the user to enter the WebSocket server URL, perhaps with a default one.\n\nThen, it should connect to the server, and once connected, it should allow the user to type messages and send them by pressing enter.\n\nAt the same time, it should display any incoming messages from the server in real-time.\n\nThis sounds like I need to handle multiple threads: one for reading user input and sending messages, and another for receiving messages from the server.\n\nIn Java, for handling user input from the console, I can use Scanner class to read lines from System.in.\n\nFor handling concurrent access, I'll need to synchronize access to shared resources, like the Session object.\n\nWait, but since WebSocket events are delivered on Tyrus' threads, and user input is handled on separate threads, I need to manage access to the Session object carefully.\n\nMaybe I'll use a synchronized block when accessing the Session to send messages.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that if the connection is closed, the client handles it gracefully, perhaps reconnecting or exiting.\n\nLet me think about the flow:\n\n1. User starts the program.\n\n2. Program prompts for WebSocket server URL.\n\n3. User enters the URL or presses enter to accept the default.\n\n4. Program attempts to connect to the server.\n\n5. Once connected, it starts two threads:\n\na. One for reading user input from the console and sending messages.\n\nb. One for listening to incoming messages from the server and displaying them.\n\n6. If the connection is closed or an error occurs, it should inform the user and possibly attempt to reconnect.\n\nWait, maybe having two separate threads is not necessary. Since Java's Scanner can read from System.in without blocking the entire program, perhaps I can use a single thread with a loop that alternates between reading user input and checking for incoming messages.\n\nBut that might not be efficient or straightforward. Maybe using two threads is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Java's ExecutorService to manage a thread pool for handling user input and message reception.\n\nBut perhaps that's overkill for a simple chat client.\n\nLet me see if there's a better way.\n\nIn WebSocket clients, the connection is event-driven, so I can handle incoming messages in the @OnMessage callback.\n\nFor sending messages, I can have a separate thread that reads from the console and sends messages via the Session.\n\nYes, that seems reasonable.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Main method:\n\n- Prompt user for server URL.\n\n- Create ChatClient instance.\n\n- Call connect method with the URL.\n\n- Start a thread for reading user input and sending messages.\n\n- The @OnMessage method will handle incoming messages and print them to the console.\n\n- When the connection is closed or an error occurs, handle it appropriately.\n\nI need to make sure that the Session object is accessible from both the main thread and the user input thread.\n\nSo, perhaps I'll store the Session as an instance variable in the ChatClient class.\n\nLet me try to outline the class structure:\n\npublic class ChatClient {\n\nprivate Session userSession;\n\n@OnOpen\n\npublic void onOpen(Session session) {\n\nthis.userSession = session;\n\n// Connection opened, maybe print a message\n\n}\n\n@OnClose\n\npublic void onClose(Session session, CloseReason closeReason) {\n\n// Connection closed, handle accordingly\n\n}\n\n@OnMessage\n\npublic void onMessage(String message) {\n\n// Print incoming message to console\n\n}\n\n@OnError\n\npublic void onError(Throwable throwable) {\n\n// Handle errors\n\n}\n\npublic void connect(String url) {\n\n// Code to connect to the server\n\n}\n\npublic void sendMessage(String message) {\n\n// Use userSession to send the message\n\n}\n\n}\n\nWait, but in Tyrus, the @ClientEndpoint class is used for defining the endpoint, and the WebSocketContainer is used to create and connect sessions.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to separate concerns a bit more.\n\nLet me look up a simple Tyrus client example.\n\nOkay, found an example.\n\nYou create a class annotated with @ClientEndpoint, define the callback methods like @OnOpen, @OnMessage, etc., and then use WebSocketContainer to connect to the URL with this endpoint class.\n\nSo, in my case, I can define a class, say, ChatEndpoint, annotated with @ClientEndpoint, and define the callback methods there.\n\nThen, in my ChatClient class, I can use WebSocketContainer to connect to the server URL with an instance of ChatEndpoint.\n\nWait, but I need to share the Session between the endpoint and the client class, so that the client can send messages using that Session.\n\nHow can I do that?\n\nMaybe I can have the ChatEndpoint set the Session in the ChatClient when the connection is opened.\n\nYes, that sounds workable.\n\nSo, ChatClient will have a Session field, and in the @OnOpen method of ChatEndpoint, it will set this field.\n\nAlso, I need to pass the ChatClient instance to the ChatEndpoint so that it can set the Session.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps ChatEndpoint can extend ChatClient and set the Session accordingly.\n\nHmm, maybe composition is better.\n\nLet me try this:\n\npublic class ChatClient {\n\nprivate Session userSession;\n\nprivate WebSocketContainer container;\n\npublic ChatClient() {\n\ncontainer = ContainerProvider.getWebSocketContainer();\n\n}\n\npublic void connect(String url) throws DeploymentException, IOException {\n\nChatEndpoint endpoint = new ChatEndpoint(this);\n\ncontainer.connectToServer(endpoint, URI.create(url));\n\n}\n\npublic void sendMessage(String message) {\n\nif (userSession != null && userSession.isOpen()) {\n\nuserSession.getAsyncRemote().sendText(message);\n\n} else {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Not connected.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\n// Possibly other methods for handling connection close, etc.\n\n}\n\nAnd then:\n\n@ClientEndpoint\n\npublic class ChatEndpoint {\n\nprivate ChatClient chatClient;\n\npublic ChatEndpoint(ChatClient chatClient) {\n\nthis.chatClient = chatClient;\n\n}\n\n@OnOpen\n\npublic void onOpen(Session session) {\n\nchatClient.setUserSession(session);\n\n// Maybe print a connection open message\n\n}\n\n@OnMessage\n\npublic void onMessage(String message) {\n\n// Pass the message to chatClient or handle it here\n\nchatClient.handleIncomingMessage(message);\n\n}\n\n@OnClose\n\npublic void onClose(Session session, CloseReason closeReason) {\n\n// Handle connection close\n\nchatClient.handleConnectionClose(closeReason);\n\n}\n\n@OnError\n\npublic void onError(Session session, Throwable throwable) {\n\n// Handle errors\n\nchatClient.handleErrorMessage(throwable);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nIn this setup, ChatClient holds the Session and provides a method to send messages.\n\nChatEndpoint is responsible for handling WebSocket events and updating the ChatClient accordingly.\n\nI need to add methods to ChatClient to handle incoming messages, connection close, and errors.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic class ChatClient {\n\n// ...\n\nprivate Session userSession;\n\npublic void setUserSession(Session session) {\n\nthis.userSession = session;\n\n}\n\npublic void handleIncomingMessage(String message) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Received message: \" + message);\n\n}\n\npublic void handleConnectionClose(CloseReason closeReason) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Connection closed: \" + closeReason.getReasonPhrase());\n\n}\n\npublic void handleErrorMessage(Throwable throwable) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Error: \" + throwable.getMessage());\n\n}\n\n// ...\n\n}\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nNow, in the main method, I need to:\n\n- Prompt user for server URL.\n\n- Create ChatClient instance.\n\n- Connect to the server.\n\n- Start a thread to read user input and send messages.\n\n- In the ChatEndpoint's @OnMessage method, print incoming messages.\n\n- Handle connection close and errors appropriately.\n\nLet me think about how to handle user input in a separate thread.\n\nI can create a Scanner object to read from System.in, and start a thread that loops, reading lines from the Scanner and sending them via chatClient.sendMessage().\n\nI need to make sure that the thread exits gracefully when the connection is closed or the program is terminated.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the user enters an empty line or a specific command to exit.\n\nAlternatively, I can define a specific exit command, like \"/quit\" or something similar.\n\nLet me outline the user input thread:\n\n- Create a Scanner for System.in.\n\n- Loop:\n\n- Read a line from Scanner.\n\n- If the line is empty or \"/quit\", break and exit.\n\n- Otherwise, send the message using chatClient.sendMessage().\n\n- Close the Scanner.\n\nI also need to make sure that the main thread doesn't exit immediately after starting the user input thread; it should wait for the user input thread to finish.\n\nSo, I'll need to keep a reference to the user input thread and call join() on it.\n\nWait, but if the connection is closed by the server, I need to stop the user input thread as well.\n\nThis requires some synchronization.\n\nMaybe I'll introduce a boolean flag that indicates whether the connection is active.\n\nWhen the connection is closed, set this flag to false, and in the user input thread, check this flag periodically.\n\nWait, but Scanner.read() is blocking, so how do I interrupt it?\n\nIn Java, Scanner's read methods aren't interruptible by default.\n\nOne way to handle this is to set a timeout on the Scanner's read operation, so that it periodically checks the connection status.\n\nAlternatively, I can use System.in.read() directly and set it to non-blocking, but that complicates things.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to set a flag and let the user input thread check the flag after each message send.\n\nSo, something like:\n\npublic class ChatClient {\n\n// ...\n\nprivate volatile boolean isConnected = false;\n\npublic void connect(String url) throws DeploymentException, IOException {\n\nisConnected = true;\n\nChatEndpoint endpoint = new ChatEndpoint(this);\n\ncontainer.connectToServer(endpoint, URI.create(url));\n\n}\n\npublic void handleClose(CloseReason closeReason) {\n\nisConnected = false;\n\n}\n\npublic void handleErrorMessage(Throwable throwable) {\n\nisConnected = false;\n\n}\n\n// ...\n\n}\n\nAnd in the user input thread:\n\nwhile (chatClient.isConnected()) {\n\nString message = scanner.nextLine();\n\nif (message.equals(\"/quit\")) {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\nchatClient.sendMessage(message);\n\n}\n\nThis way, if the connection is closed, isConnected() returns false, and the loop exits.\n\nI need to implement isConnected() in ChatClient:\n\npublic boolean isConnected() {\n\nreturn userSession != null && userSession.isOpen();\n\n}\n\nWait, but userSession might be null before the connection is established.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\npublic boolean isConnected() {\n\nreturn userSession != null && userSession.isOpen();\n\n}\n\nIn the connect method, set isConnected to true, and in handleClose and handleErrorMessage, set it to false.\n\nAlso, in the @OnOpen method, set isConnected to true.\n\nWait, no, in @OnOpen, set the userSession.\n\nSo, in ChatClient:\n\npublic void setUserSession(Session session) {\n\nthis.userSession = session;\n\n}\n\nAnd in handleClose and handleErrorMessage, set userSession to null.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a separate boolean flag for connection status.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll use the userSession's open status.\n\nNow, for the main method:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Enter WebSocket server URL: \");\n\nString url = scanner.nextLine();\n\nif (url.isEmpty()) {\n\nurl = \"wss://default.server.com\"; // Provide a default URL\n\n}\n\nChatClient chatClient = new ChatClient();\n\ntry {\n\nchatClient.connect(url);\n\n} catch (Exception e) {\n\nSystem.err.println(\"Connection failed: \" + e.getMessage());\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\n// Start user input thread\n\nThread userInputThread = new Thread(() -> {\n\ntry (Scanner inputScanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {\n\nwhile (chatClient.isConnected()) {\n\nString message = inputScanner.nextLine();\n\nif (message.equals(\"/quit\")) {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\nchatClient.sendMessage(message);\n\n}\n\n} catch (Exception e) {\n\nSystem.err.println(\"User input thread error: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n}\n\n});\n\nuserInputThread.start();\n\n// Wait for the user input thread to finish\n\ntry {\n\nuserInputThread.join();\n\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n\nThread.currentThread().interrupt();\n\n}\n\n// Clean up\n\nchatClient.closeConnection();\n\n}\n\nI need to add a closeConnection method in ChatClient to close the session properly.\n\npublic void closeConnection() {\n\nif (userSession != null && userSession.isOpen()) {\n\ntry {\n\nuserSession.close();\n\n} catch (IOException e) {\n\nSystem.err.println(\"Error closing connection: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nAlso, in the handleClose method, set userSession to null or set isConnected to false.\n\npublic void handleClose(CloseReason closeReason) {\n\nuserSession = null;\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, in handleErrorMessage, set userSession to null.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all methods accessing userSession are thread-safe.\n\nSince userSession is accessed from different threads, I need to synchronize access to it.\n\nBut in Java, assigning to and reading from a volatile reference is atomic, so if I declare userSession as volatile, I shouldn't need additional synchronization.\n\nSo, in ChatClient:\n\nprivate volatile Session userSession;\n\nThat should suffice.\n\nAlso, in the user input thread, I'm using a separate Scanner instance. Make sure to close it properly.\n\nWait, in the user input thread, I have:\n\ntry (Scanner inputScanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {\n\n...\n\n}\n\nThis should work, as try-with-resources will close the scanner when the thread exits.\n\nNow, for handling incoming messages, in the @OnMessage method, I need to print them to the console.\n\nBut I need to make sure that printing doesn't interfere with user input.\n\nIn Java, System.out.println() is thread-safe, so multiple threads can call it without issues.\n\nSo, in ChatEndpoint:\n\n@OnMessage\n\npublic void onMessage(String message) {\n\nchatClient.handleIncomingMessage(message);\n\n}\n\nAnd in ChatClient:\n\npublic void handleIncomingMessage(String message) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Received: \" + message);\n\n}\n\nThis should work.\n\nI should also handle the case where the server sends binary data or other types of messages, but for simplicity, I'll assume that all messages are text.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to add timestamps to incoming messages or format them differently, but that's optional.\n\nNow, I need to consider error handling.\n\nIn the connect method, I'm catching DeploymentException and IOException, and printing an error message.\n\nIn the handleClose and handleErrorMessage methods, I'm setting userSession to null and possibly printing error messages.\n\nI should also think about retrying the connection if it fails or reconnecting if the connection is lost.\n\nBut for a simple chat client, I'll keep it straightforward and not implement automatic reconnection.\n\nIf the connection is lost, the client can exit or provide an option to reconnect.\n\nTo make it a bit more user-friendly, I can prompt the user to reconnect or exit after the connection is lost.\n\nSo, in the main method, after the user input thread finishes, check if the connection was lost and ask the user if they want to reconnect.\n\nSomething like:\n\nif (!chatClient.isConnected()) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Connection lost. Do you want to reconnect? (yes/no)\");\n\nString choice = scanner.nextLine();\n\nif (choice.equalsIgnoreCase(\"yes\")) {\n\n// Attempt to reconnect\n\nchatClient.connect(url);\n\n// Restart the user input thread\n\nuserInputThread = new Thread(() -> {\n\ntry (Scanner inputScanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {\n\nwhile (chatClient.isConnected()) {\n\nString message = inputScanner.nextLine();\n\nif (message.equals(\"/quit\")) {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\nchatClient.sendMessage(message);\n\n}\n\n} catch (Exception e) {\n\nSystem.err.println(\"User input thread error: \" + e.getMessage());\n\n}\n\n});\n\nuserInputThread.start();\n\nuserInputThread.join();\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis way, the client can attempt to reconnect if the connection is lost.\n\nI need to make sure that the chatClient instance can handle multiple connect calls, perhaps by closing any existing session before connecting again.\n\nSo, in the connect method, before connecting, check if there's an existing session and close it.\n\npublic void connect(String url) throws DeploymentException, IOException {\n\nif (userSession != null && userSession.isOpen()) {\n\nuserSession.close();\n\n}\n\nisConnected = true;\n\nChatEndpoint endpoint = new ChatEndpoint(this);\n\ncontainer.connectToServer(endpoint, URI.create(url));\n\n}\n\nThis should manage reconnecting properly.\n\nAlso, in the handleClose and handleErrorMessage methods, set isConnected to false.\n\npublic void handleClose(CloseReason closeReason) {\n\nuserSession = null;\n\nisConnected = false;\n\n}\n\npublic void handleErrorMessage(Throwable throwable) {\n\nuserSession = null;\n\nisConnected = false;\n\n}\n\nNow, I need to think about the user interface.\n\nIn the command line, when the user is typing messages, and incoming messages are being printed, it could get messy if not handled properly.\n\nTo avoid mixing user input and incoming messages, maybe I can print incoming messages above the user input prompt.\n\nIn Java, I can use ANSI escape codes to move the cursor and print messages without disturbing the user input line.\n\nBut that complicates things, and implementing a fully featured terminal-based chat client with proper formatting is beyond the scope of this simple example.\n\nSo, I'll keep it simple and just print incoming messages as they arrive, and let the user deal with the mixing of input and output.\n\nUsers of command-line tools are used to this kind of behavior.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a GUI for a better chat experience, but since the task is to create a simple chat client, I'll stick with the command line.\n\nNow, I need to consider security aspects.\n\nSince WebSockets can be secured with WSS (WebSocket Secure), which is WebSocket over TLS, I need to make sure that the client can connect to both WS and WSS URLs.\n\nIn Tyrus, connecting to WSS is straightforward; it's just a matter of providing the correct URL.\n\nI need to make sure that the WebSocketContainer is configured to trust the server's certificate if it's self-signed or not in the Java truststore.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that the server's certificate is valid or that the user accepts the risk of connecting to an insecure server.\n\nIf needed, I can add options for configuring SSL properties, but that's advanced and not necessary for this basic chat client.\n\nAnother security consideration is that messages sent over WS are not encrypted, so sensitive information should not be transmitted without additional encryption.\n\nBut again, for this simple example, I'll ignore that.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to handle large messages or messages that contain special characters.\n\nWebSocket text messages are UTF-8 encoded, so I need to make sure that the client handles Unicode characters properly.\n\nIn Java, String handles Unicode well, so as long as I use String for messages, it should be fine.\n\nFor large messages, WebSocket has limitations on message size, which depend on the server and client configurations.\n\nTyrus should handle fragmenting large messages if necessary.\n\nBut for a chat client, messages are usually short, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nI should also consider rate limiting or throttling to prevent abuse, but that's more relevant for the server side.\n\nOn the client side, I can limit how fast the user can send messages, but that's optional.\n\nFor now, I'll allow the user to send messages as fast as they can.\n\nNow, let's think about testing the chat client.\n\nI need a WebSocket server to connect to.\n\nI can either set up a test server or connect to an existing public WebSocket chat server.\n\nFor testing purposes, maybe I can use a public WebSocket echo server, where the server simply echoes back any message it receives.\n\nThis way, I can verify that the client is sending and receiving messages correctly.\n\nThere are public WebSocket echo servers available; I can look up one and use its URL as a default.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up a simple WebSocket server using Tyrus or another framework to test the client.\n\nBut for the sake of time, using a public echo server is sufficient.\n\nI need to find a public WebSocket echo server URL to use in the client.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that \"wss://echo.websocket.org\" is a popular public echo server.\n\nSo, I'll use that as the default URL.\n\nIn the main method, if the user doesn't provide a URL, I'll use \"wss://echo.websocket.org\".\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the client can connect to both WS and WSS URLs, depending on what the user provides.\n\nIn Tyrus, connecting to WS or WSS is the same; it's just a matter of the URL scheme.\n\nI need to make sure that the client handles both securely.\n\nAlso, I need to handle cases where the URL is invalid or the server is unreachable.\n\nIn the connect method, exceptions like IOException or DeploymentException will be thrown, and I can catch them and inform the user.\n\nNow, let's think about the user experience.\n\nWhen the program starts, it should display a prompt asking for the server URL.\n\nAfter connecting, it should indicate that the connection is established.\n\nAs messages are sent and received, they should be displayed clearly.\n\nWhen the connection is lost or closed, the user should be informed.\n\nAlso, providing a way to exit the chat, like typing \"/quit\" or pressing Ctrl+C, would be useful.\n\nI need to handle KeyboardInterrupt exceptions to allow the user to exit gracefully.\n\nIn Java, KeyboardInterrupt is signaled by interrupting the main thread.\n\nSo, in the main method, I can set up a shutdown hook to handle graceful exit.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll handle it by checking if the user inputs \"/quit\".\n\nNow, let's consider implementing some basic chat features.\n\nFor example, nicknames, private messages, or displaying connected users.\n\nBut these are more advanced and beyond the scope of a simple chat client.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it basic: users can send and receive public messages in real-time.\n\nI should also think about message buffering or queueing.\n\nIf the user sends multiple messages quickly, I need to make sure that they are sent in order and without loss.\n\nIn WebSocket, messages are ordered and not lost as long as the connection is open.\n\nSo, as long as I send messages using the Session's async send method, Tyrus should handle queuing and ordering.\n\nI don't need to implement additional buffering.\n\nNow, I need to consider exception handling within the WebSocket event methods.\n\nFor example, in @OnMessage, if there's an error processing the message, I need to handle it without crashing the client.\n\nSimilarly, in @OnError, I need to handle exceptions gracefully.\n\nIn the handleErrorMessage method, I can log the error and set the connection status to false.\n\nAlso, in the handleClose method, I can log the close reason.\n\nNow, I need to think about logging.\n\nFor a simple chat client, printing messages to the console is sufficient.\n\nBut if I were to make it more robust, I could implement proper logging using a logging framework like Log4j.\n\nBut for now, System.out and System.err will suffice.\n\nNow, I need to consider internationalization, in case users want to send messages in different languages.\n\nSince I'm using UTF-8 encoded Strings, Java should handle different languages properly.\n\nI need to make sure that the console encoding is set to UTF-8 to display non-ASCII characters correctly.\n\nIn Eclipse or other IDEs, I can set the console encoding to UTF-8.\n\nOn the command line, the system's default encoding is used, so users might need to set their console to UTF-8.\n\nI can add a note in the program's documentation about this.\n\nNow, let's think about performance.\n\nSince this is a simple chat client, performance shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nWebSockets are designed for real-time communication, so they should handle chat messages efficiently.\n\nI don't need to implement any optimizations unless there are specific performance requirements.\n\nNow, I need to consider if there are any specific message formats or protocols to follow when communicating with the server.\n\nFor example, some chat servers might expect messages in JSON format with specific fields like nickname, message content, etc.\n\nSince I'm connecting to a generic WebSocket server, I'll assume that messages are plain text strings.\n\nIf needed, I can extend the client to handle more complex message formats, but for now, plain text is sufficient.\n\nNow, I need to write the actual code based on the design I've outlined.\n\nI'll start by setting up a new Java project in my IDE, adding the Tyrus client dependency to pom.xml.\n\nThen, I'll create the ChatClient class with the necessary fields and methods.\n\nNext, I'll create the ChatEndpoint class annotated with @ClientEndpoint and define the callback methods.\n\nIn the main method, I'll handle user input for the server URL, create ChatClient instance, connect to the server, and start the user input thread.\n\nI'll also handle reconnecting if the connection is lost.\n\nI need to make sure that all exceptions are caught and appropriate error messages are displayed.\n\nI should also add comments to the code for clarity.\n\nOnce the code is written, I'll test it by connecting to the public echo server and sending/receiving messages.\n\nI need to verify that messages are sent and received correctly, that connection loss is handled properly, and that the user can exit the program gracefully.\n\nIf everything works as expected, I can consider the task completed.\n\nOtherwise, I'll debug any issues that arise and iterate until the client functions correctly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple chat client in Java that connects to a remote server via WebSocket, allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.\n- Set up a Maven project and include the Tyrus client dependency in your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.glassfish.tyrus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>tyrus-client</artifactId>\n    <version>x.x.x</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.glassfish.tyrus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>tyrus-container-jdk-http</artifactId>\n    <version>x.x.x</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->\n</dependency>\n```\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport javax.websocket.*;\nimport javax.websocket.ContainerProvider;\nimport javax.websocket.Session;\nimport

       System.err.println(\"Connection failed: \" + e.getMessage());\n            return;\n        }\n\n        Thread userInputThread = new Thread(() -> {\n            try (Scanner inputScanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {\n                while (chatClient.isConnected()) {\n                    String message = inputScanner.nextLine();\n                    if (message.equals(\"/quit\")) {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    chatClient.sendMessage(message);\n                }\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                System.err.println(\"User

e.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **ChatEndpoint Class**: \n   - Handles WebSocket events like connection open, message receipt, connection close, and errors.\n   - Notifies the `ChatClient` about these events.\n\n2. **ChatClient Class**:\n   - Manages the WebSocket connection and session.\n   - Sends messages to the server.\n   - Handles incoming messages and connection status changes.\n\n3. **Main Method**:\n   - Prompts the user for the WebSocket server URL.\n   - Connects to the server.\n   - Starts a thread to read user input and send messages.\n   - Handles user input and manages reconnection if needed.\n\nThis setup ensures a simple, real-time chat client that can connect to a remote WebSocket server, send and receive messages, and handle connection events appropriately."
