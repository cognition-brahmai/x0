        "content": "Let's see. The baker makes 12 loaves of bread, and each loaf contains 8 slices. So first, I need to find out how many slices there are in total.\n\nTotal slices = number of loaves \u00d7 slices per loaf\nTotal slices = 12 \u00d7 8 = 96 slices\n\nHe sells half of the slices. So, half of 96 is:\n\nSold slices = 96 / 2 = 48 slices\n\nNow, after selling 48 slices, he has:\n\nRemaining slices after sale = total slices - sold slices\nRemaining slices after sale = 96 - 48 = 48 slices\n\nThen, he gives away one quarter of what remains. So, one quarter of 48 is:\n\nGiven away slices = remaining slices after sale / 4\nGiven away slices = 48 / 4 = 12 slices\n\nFinally, the number of slices he has left is:\n\nSlices left = remaining slices after sale - given away slices\nSlices left = 48 - 12 = 36 slices\n\nSo, the baker has 36 slices left."
