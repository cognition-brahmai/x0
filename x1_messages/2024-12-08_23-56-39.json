        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Here's a Ruby script that generates a random password of a specified length, ensuring it contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character:\n\n```ruby\ndef generate_password(length)\n  if length < 4\n    puts \"Password length should be at least 4 to include all required character types.\"\n    return nil\n  end\n\n  uppercase_letters = ('A'..'Z').to_a\n  lowercase_letters = ('a'..'z').to_a\n  digits = ('0'..'9').to_a\n  special_characters = ['!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '&', '*', '(', ')', '-', '+', '=', '_', '?', '[', ']', '{', '}', '|', ';', ':', '<', '>', ',', '.', '/', '~']\n\n  # Ensure at least one character from each category\n  password = [\n    uppercase_letters.sample,\n    lowercase_letters.sample,\n    digits.sample,\n    special_characters.sample\n  ]\n\n  # Fill the remaining length with a mix of all characters\n  all_characters = uppercase_letters + lowercase_letters + digits + special_characters\n  remaining_length = length - 4\n  remaining_length.times { password << all_characters.sample }\n\n  # Shuffle the password array to avoid the first four characters always being the required types\n  password.shuffle!\n\n  # Convert array to string\n  password.join\nend\n\nputs \"Enter the desired password length:\"\nlength = gets.chomp.to_i\npassword = generate_password(length)\nif password\n  puts \"Generated Password: #{password}\"\nelse\n  puts \"Failed to generate password.\"\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Validation**: The script checks if the desired password length is at least 4 characters since we need to include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.\n2. **Character Sets**: Defines arrays for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\n3. **Initial Password Characters**: Selects one random character from each category to ensure the password meets the requirements.\n4. **Remaining Characters**: Fills the remaining length of the password with a random selection from all character types.\n5. **Shuffling**: Shuffles the password array to avoid the first four characters always being the required types.\n6. **Output**: Joins the array into a string and displays the generated password.\n\nYou can run this script in any Ruby environment. Just copy the code into a Ruby file (e.g., `password_generator.rb`) and execute it using the Ruby interpreter. The script will prompt you to enter the desired password length and then display the generated password."
