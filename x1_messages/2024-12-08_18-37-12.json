        "content": "So there are two trains, one leaving from City A going to City B at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaving from City B going to City A at 80 miles per hour. The distance between the two cities is 280 miles. I need to find out how many hours it will take for these two trains to meet each other.\n\nAlright, let's see. This seems like a problem involving relative speed. When two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, in this case, the relative speed would be 60 mph plus 80 mph, which is 140 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two cities is 280 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 280 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 280 divided by 140 is 2. So, the time it takes for the trains to meet is 2 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If one train is going at 60 mph and the other at 80 mph, and they're moving towards each other, their combined speed is indeed 140 mph. And the distance is 280 miles. So, time should be 280 divided by 140, which is indeed 2 hours.\n\nLet me think about it another way to confirm. In 1 hour, the first train would cover 60 miles, and the second train would cover 80 miles. Together, they would have covered 60 + 80 = 140 miles in 1 hour. Since the total distance is 280 miles, it would take them 280 divided by 140, which is again 2 hours to cover the entire distance between them.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of each train's contribution to closing the gap. Train from A is closing the gap at 60 miles per hour, and the train from B is closing it at 80 miles per hour. Together, they're closing the gap at 140 miles per hour, so 280 miles divided by 140 miles per hour equals 2 hours.\n\nI think this is correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider the positions of the trains over time.\n\nAt time t = 0 hours:\n\n- Train from A is at City A (0 miles)\n\n- Train from B is at City B (280 miles)\n\nAt time t hours:\n\n- Train from A has traveled 60t miles\n\n- Train from B has traveled 80t miles\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of the distances they've traveled should equal the total distance between the cities, which is 280 miles.\n\nSo:\n\n60t + 80t = 280\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n140t = 280\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 280 / 140\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems definite that the trains will meet after 2 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Perhaps using relative speed from one train's perspective.\n\nLet's choose the train from City A as our reference point. From its perspective, it's moving at 60 mph, and the train from City B is moving towards it at 80 mph. So, from the perspective of the train from City A, the approaching train is moving at 80 mph, and it has to cover the initial 280 miles.\n\nWait, no. Actually, relative speed when two objects are moving towards each other is the sum of their speeds. So, from the perspective of the train from City A, the train from City B is approaching at a speed of 60 + 80 = 140 mph. So, the time to cover 280 miles at 140 mph is still 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the train from City B's perspective, it sees the train from City A approaching at 60 + 80 = 140 mph, so again, time is 280 / 140 = 2 hours.\n\nAnother way could be to find out where each train is at a given time and set their positions equal to each other.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the position of the train from City A as:\n\nPosition A = 60t miles from City A\n\nAnd the position of the train from City B as:\n\nPosition B = 280 - 80t miles from City A (since it's moving towards City A)\n\nSet Position A equal to Position B:\n\n60t = 280 - 80t\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n60t + 80t = 280\n\n140t = 280\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that no matter which approach I take, the answer consistently comes out to be 2 hours. So, I can confidently say that the trains will meet after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
