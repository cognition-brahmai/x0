        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the car factory produces 15 cars every hour. We need to find out how many cars it produces in a week. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many hours there are in a week. I know that:\n\n- There are 24 hours in a day.\n\n- There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, to find the total number of hours in a week, I can multiply the number of hours in a day by the number of days in a week:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 168 hours/week\n\nNow that I know there are 168 hours in a week, and the factory produces 15 cars every hour, I can find the total number of cars produced in a week by multiplying the number of cars produced per hour by the total number of hours in a week:\n\n15 cars/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = 2520 cars/week\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make any mistake.\n\n15 \u00d7 168:\n\nFirst, 15 \u00d7 100 = 1500\n\nThen, 15 \u00d7 60 = 900\n\nAnd finally, 15 \u00d7 8 = 120\n\nNow, adding those up: 1500 + 900 = 2400, and 2400 + 120 = 2520\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the factory produces 2520 cars in a week.\n\nBut, let me think about this again. Is there any other factor I should consider? For example, does the factory operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week? Or are there breaks or downtime?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any downtime, so I'll assume the factory operates continuously without any breaks.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by calculating the daily production and then multiplying by the number of days in a week.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, find the number of cars produced per day.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day, and the factory produces 15 cars per hour, so:\n\n15 cars/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 360 cars/day\n\nNow, there are 7 days in a week, so:\n\n360 cars/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 2520 cars/week\n\nAgain, I get the same result, which reinforces that my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total production in terms of hours in a week.\n\nSince there are 168 hours in a week, and the factory produces 15 cars per hour, multiplying these gives:\n\n15 cars/hour \u00d7 168 hours = 2520 cars\n\nThis matches the previous calculations.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. The factory produces 2520 cars in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2520} \\]"
