        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 4 red balls, 5 green balls, and 6 blue balls in a box, making a total of 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 balls. The question is asking for the probability that when I pick two balls at random without replacement, they are of different colors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I pick the first ball, it stays outside the box, and the second ball is picked from the remaining balls. So, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nTo find the probability of picking two balls of different colors, I can approach this in a couple of ways. One way is to calculate the probability directly by considering all the possible combinations of different colors. Another way is to calculate the probability of picking two balls of the same color and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of picking two balls of different colors. I think the second method might be simpler.\n\nLet's try the second method. First, find the probability of picking two balls of the same color, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 15 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTotal ways to pick 2 balls out of 15 is C(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15 - 2)!) = (15 \u00d7 14) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 105.\n\nNow, the number of ways to pick 2 balls of the same color:\n\n- For red balls: There are 4 red balls, so C(4, 2) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 6.\n\n- For green balls: There are 5 green balls, so C(5, 2) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 10.\n\n- For blue balls: There are 6 blue balls, so C(6, 2) = (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 15.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls of the same color is 6 + 10 + 15 = 31.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking 2 balls of the same color is 31 / 105.\n\nThen, the probability of picking 2 balls of different colors is 1 - (31 / 105) = (105 - 31) / 105 = 74 / 105.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if this is the simplest form. Let's see if 74 and 105 have any common factors.\n\n74 factors: 1, 2, 37, 74.\n\n105 factors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105.\n\nNo common factors other than 1, so 74/105 is already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could have calculated the probability directly by finding the number of ways to pick two balls of different colors and dividing by the total number of ways to pick any two balls.\n\nLet's try that to verify.\n\nNumber of ways to pick two balls of different colors:\n\n- Red and green: 4 red \u00d7 5 green = 20.\n\n- Red and blue: 4 red \u00d7 6 blue = 24.\n\n- Green and blue: 5 green \u00d7 6 blue = 30.\n\nSo, total number of ways to pick two balls of different colors is 20 + 24 + 30 = 74.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick any two balls is C(15, 2) = 105.\n\nSo, probability is 74 / 105, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the first ball is any color is 1, since I'm picking blindly.\n\nThen, the probability that the second ball is a different color depends on what the first ball was.\n\nLet's say:\n\n- If the first ball is red (probability 4/15), then the probability that the second ball is not red is (15 - 4) / 14 = 11/14.\n\n- If the first ball is green (probability 5/15), then the probability that the second ball is not green is (15 - 5) / 14 = 10/14.\n\n- If the first ball is blue (probability 6/15), then the probability that the second ball is not blue is (15 - 6) / 14 = 9/14.\n\nSo, the total probability is:\n\n(4/15 \u00d7 11/14) + (5/15 \u00d7 10/14) + (6/15 \u00d7 9/14)\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\n(4/15 \u00d7 11/14) = (44)/(210)\n\n(5/15 \u00d7 10/14) = (50)/(210)\n\n(6/15 \u00d7 9/14) = (54)/(210)\n\nAdding them up: 44 + 50 + 54 = 148 / 210\n\nSimplifying 148/210 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 74/105.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with 74/105 as the probability that both balls are of different colors.\n\nI think this makes sense. The different methods confirm the same answer, which is always a good sign.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{74}{105}} \\]"
