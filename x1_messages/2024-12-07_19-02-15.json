        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company's revenue. The revenue function is given by R(x) = 200x - x^2, where x is the number of items sold. I need to find the maximum revenue and figure out how many items need to be sold to achieve that.\n\nFirst off, I know that revenue is typically how much money a company makes from selling things, and it's often calculated by multiplying the number of items sold by the price per item. Here, it's given as a function, R(x) = 200x - x^2. So, it seems like the price might be changing based on how many items are sold, but I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nTo find the maximum revenue, I need to find the highest point that this function reaches. Since it's a quadratic function, and the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-1), I know that the graph of this function is a downward-opening parabola. That means it has a maximum point, which is the vertex of the parabola.\n\nI recall that for a quadratic function in the form R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by x = -b/(2a). In this case, R(x) = -x^2 + 200x, so a = -1 and b = 200.\n\nPlugging those values into the formula, x = -200 / (2 * -1) = -200 / -2 = 100. So, the number of items that need to be sold to achieve maximum revenue is 100.\n\nNow, to find the maximum revenue itself, I can plug x = 100 back into the revenue function: R(100) = 200*(100) - (100)^2 = 20,000 - 10,000 = 10,000.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can use calculus to find the maximum point.\n\nIf I take the derivative of R(x) with respect to x, that should give me the slope of the revenue function at any point x. The maximum point occurs where the slope is zero.\n\nSo, R'(x) = d/dx (200x - x^2) = 200 - 2x.\n\nSetting that equal to zero: 200 - 2x = 0 => 2x = 200 => x = 100.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier using the vertex formula. Good, it's consistent.\n\nTo confirm that this is indeed a maximum, I can check the second derivative, R''(x) = d/dx (200 - 2x) = -2. Since R''(x) is negative, that means the function is concave down at x = 100, which confirms it's a maximum.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same conclusion: sell 100 items to maximize revenue, and the maximum revenue is 10,000.\n\nBut let's think about this in terms of the business context. If the company sells more than 100 items, according to this function, the revenue starts to decrease. That seems odd because usually, selling more items would increase revenue, unless there's some constraint like limited production capacity or decreasing prices due to excess supply.\n\nMaybe the function is modeling a situation where each additional item sold reduces the price for all items, like a volume discount. For example, if the company sells more items, it has to lower the price, hence the revenue doesn't increase linearly.\n\nIn that case, the function R(x) = 200x - x^2 might represent a scenario where the price per item is 200 - x. So, the revenue is x * (200 - x) = 200x - x^2, which matches the given function.\n\nSo, if the price per item is 200 - x, then when x = 100, the price per item is 200 - 100 = 100, and the total revenue is 100 items * 100 = 10,000, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nIf the company sells fewer than 100 items, say x = 50, then the price per item is 200 - 50 = 150, and revenue is 50 * 150 = 7,500, which is less than the maximum.\n\nIf they sell more than 100 items, say x = 150, then the price per item is 200 - 150 = 50, and revenue is 150 * 50 = 7,500 again, which is less than the maximum.\n\nSo, indeed, the maximum revenue is achieved when 100 items are sold, yielding a revenue of 10,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try to complete the square for the revenue function to find the vertex again.\n\nStarting with R(x) = -x^2 + 200x.\n\nFirst, factor out the coefficient of x^2: R(x) = - (x^2 - 200x).\n\nNow, to complete the square, take half of the coefficient of x, which is -200, halve it to -100, and square it to get 10,000.\n\nSo, R(x) = - (x^2 - 200x + 10,000 - 10,000) = - ( (x - 100)^2 - 10,000 ) = - (x - 100)^2 + 10,000.\n\nFrom this, it's clear that the maximum revenue is 10,000, achieved when x = 100.\n\nAll these methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident about this answer.\n\nIn summary, the company should sell 100 items to achieve the maximum revenue of 10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10000} \\]"
