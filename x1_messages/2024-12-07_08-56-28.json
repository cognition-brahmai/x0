        "content": "That sounds like pointillism! It's a technique where artists use tiny dots or strokes of pure color that, when viewed from a distance, optically mix in the viewer's eye to create the illusion of a broader image with varying hues and tones. The idea is that the human eye will blend the colors together, similar to how pixels on a screen create images. One of the most famous examples of pointillism is Georges Seurat's \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.\""
