        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if I have a stack of 1000 sheets of paper, and each sheet is 0.1 mm thick, how tall will the whole stack be in meters? Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total thickness of all 1000 sheets. Since each sheet is 0.1 mm thick, I can multiply the number of sheets by the thickness of each sheet to get the total thickness in millimeters. So, that would be 1000 sheets times 0.1 mm per sheet.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1000 \u00d7 0.1 = 100 mm.\n\nOkay, so the stack is 100 mm tall. But the question asks for the height in meters, not millimeters. I need to convert millimeters to meters. I remember that there are 1000 millimeters in a meter.\n\nSo, to convert millimeters to meters, I can divide the number of millimeters by 1000. So, 100 mm divided by 1000 equals 0.1 meters.\n\nTherefore, the stack of 1000 sheets of paper will be 0.1 meters tall.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. Each sheet is 0.1 mm thick, which is pretty thin. 1000 sheets should add up to some thickness, but 0.1 meters seems a bit small.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in the conversion. Let's see: 1000 mm is 1 meter, so 100 mm should be 0.1 meters. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of smaller numbers. Suppose I had 10 sheets: 10 \u00d7 0.1 mm = 1 mm, which is 0.001 meters. That seems right. So, scaling up, 1000 sheets would be 100 mm, which is 0.1 meters.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the thickness in meters from the start. Each sheet is 0.1 mm, which is 0.0001 meters (since 1 mm = 0.001 meters, so 0.1 mm = 0.0001 meters). Then, 1000 sheets would be 1000 \u00d7 0.0001 = 0.1 meters. Same answer.\n\nSo, I think 0.1 meters is correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider the stack in different units. For example, in centimeters. There are 10 millimeters in a centimeter, so 100 mm is 10 centimeters. That seems more relatable\u2014 a stack of 1000 sheets being 10 cm tall sounds about right.\n\nWait, but the question wants the answer in meters. 10 cm is 0.1 meters, so it matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about real-world examples, a ream of paper is usually 500 sheets, and it's about 5 cm thick. So, 1000 sheets would be about 10 cm, which is 0.1 meters. That seems consistent.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The stack will be 0.1 meters tall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.1} \\]"
