It sounds like you're looking to create a C# WPF application where users can draw shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines on a canvas using their mouse. Additionally, you want to implement undo and redo functionality using the Command pattern and allow users to save their drawings as image files, with options for different quality settings like PNG or JPEG.\n\nFirst, let's break down the requirements:\n\n1. **Drawing Shapes:**\n   - Users should be able to draw rectangles, circles, and lines on a canvas using the mouse.\n   - This will involve handling mouse events such as mouse down, mouse move, and mouse up.\n\n2. **Undo and Redo Functionality:**\n   - Implementing undo and redo using the Command pattern.\n   - The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.\n\n3. **Saving Drawings:**\n   - Allow users to save their drawings as image files.\n   - Provide options to save as PNG or JPEG with adjustable quality settings.\n\nLet's tackle each part step by step.\n\n### 1. Drawing Shapes\n\nIn WPF, you can use the `Canvas` panel to draw shapes. You'll need to handle mouse events to capture the user's drawing actions.\n\n#### Steps:\n\n- Create a new WPF project in Visual Studio.\n- Add a `Canvas` to your XAML file where the drawing will take place.\n- Handle mouse events on the canvas to draw shapes.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might set up the canvas and handle mouse events for drawing rectangles:\n\n```xml\n<Window x:Class=\"DrawingApp.MainWindow\"\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Title=\"Drawing App\" Height=\"450\" Width=\"800\">\n    <Grid>\n        <Canvas x:Name=\"drawingCanvas\" Background=\"White\" MouseDown=\"Canvas_MouseDown\" MouseMove=\"Canvas_MouseMove\" MouseUp=\"Canvas_MouseUp\"/>\n    </Grid>\n</Window>\n```\n\nIn the code-behind (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`):\n\n```csharp\npublic partial class MainWindow : Window\n{\n    private Point startPoint;\n    private Point endPoint;\n    private Shape currentShape;\n\n    public MainWindow()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n\n    private void Canvas_MouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)\n    {\n        if (e.ChangedButton == MouseButton.Left)\n        {\n            startPoint = e.GetPosition(drawingCanvas);\n            currentShape = new Rectangle\n            {\n                Stroke = Brushes.Black,\n                StrokeThickness = 2\n            };\n            Canvas.SetLeft(currentShape, startPoint.X);\n            Canvas.SetTop(currentShape, startPoint.Y);\n            drawingCanvas.Children.Add(currentShape);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void Canvas_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)\n    {\n        if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed && currentShape != null)\n        {\n            endPoint = e.GetPosition(drawingCanvas);\n            double width = endPoint.X - startPoint.X;\n            double height = endPoint.Y - startPoint.Y;\n\n            if (currentShape is Rectangle rect)\n            {\n                rect.Width = Math.Abs(width);\n                rect.Height = Math.Abs(height);\n                if (width < 0) Canvas.SetLeft(rect, endPoint.X);\n                if (height < 0) Canvas.SetTop(rect, endPoint.Y);\n            }\n            else if (currentShape is Ellipse ellipse)\n            {\n                ellipse.Width = Math.Abs(width);\n                ellipse.Height = Math.Abs(height);\n                if (width < 0) Canvas.SetLeft(ellipse, endPoint.X);\n                if (height < 0) Canvas.SetTop(ellipse, endPoint.Y);\n            }\n            else if (currentShape is Line line)\n            {\n                line.X1 = startPoint.X;\n                line.Y1 = startPoint.Y;\n                line.X2 = endPoint.X;\n                line.Y2 = endPoint.Y;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void Canvas_MouseUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)\n    {\n        if (e.ChangedButton == MouseButton.Left && currentShape != null)\n        {\n            // Shape drawing completed, do nothing for now\n            currentShape = null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code sets up the canvas to draw rectangles. You can extend this to support circles (Ellipse) and lines (Line) by adding options to select the shape type and modifying the mouse event handlers accordingly.\n\n### 2. Undo and Redo Functionality using Command Pattern\n\nThe Command pattern is ideal for implementing undo and redo functionality. Each drawing action is encapsulated as a command object that can be executed and undone.\n\n#### Steps:\n\n- Define an interface for commands.\n- Create concrete command classes for each drawing action (e.g., DrawRectangleCommand, EraseShapeCommand).\n- Maintain a stack for undo and another for redo.\n- Execute commands when users perform drawing actions and push them to the undo stack.\n- Allow users to undo by popping from the undo stack and executing the undo operation, then pushing the command to the redo stack.\n- Similarly, redo by popping from the redo stack and executing the command.\n\nHere's a basic outline:\n\nDefine a command interface:\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ICommand\n{\n    void Execute();\n    void Undo();\n}\n```\n\nCreate a concrete command for drawing a rectangle:\n\n```csharp\npublic class DrawRectangleCommand : ICommand\n{\n    private readonly Canvas canvas;\n    private readonly Rectangle rectangle;\n\n    public DrawRectangleCommand(Canvas canvas, Rectangle rectangle)\n    {\n        this.canvas = canvas;\n        this.rectangle = rectangle;\n    }\n\n    public void Execute()\n    {\n        canvas.Children.Add(rectangle);\n    }\n\n    public void Undo()\n    {\n        canvas.Children.Remove(rectangle);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nManage undo and redo stacks:\n\n```csharp\npublic class UndoRedoManager\n{\n    private Stack<ICommand> undoStack = new Stack<ICommand>();\n    private Stack<ICommand> redoStack = new Stack<ICommand>();\n\n    public void ExecuteCommand(ICommand command)\n    {\n        command.Execute();\n        undoStack.Push(command);\n        redoStack.Clear(); // Clear redo stack on new action\n    }\n\n    public void Undo()\n    {\n        if (undoStack.Count > 0)\n        {\n            var command = undoStack.Pop();\n            command.Undo();\n            redoStack.Push(command);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Redo()\n    {\n        if (redoStack.Count > 0)\n        {\n            var command = redoStack.Pop();\n            command.Execute();\n            undoStack.Push(command);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIntegrate this into your MainWindow:\n\n```csharp\npublic partial class MainWindow : Window\n{\n    private UndoRedoManager undoRedoManager = new UndoRedoManager();\n    // ... other existing code ...\n\n    private void Canvas_MouseUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)\n    {\n        if (e.ChangedButton == MouseButton.Left && currentShape != null)\n        {\n            if (currentShape is Rectangle rect)\n            {\n                var command = new DrawRectangleCommand(drawingCanvas, rect);\n                undoRedoManager.ExecuteCommand(command);\n            }\n            // Similarly for other shapes\n            currentShape = null;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Add buttons for undo and redo\n    private void UndoButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        undoRedoManager.Undo();\n    }\n\n    private void RedoButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        undoRedoManager.Redo();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Saving Drawings as Image Files\n\nWPF provides easy ways to render visual elements to images. You can save the canvas content as PNG or JPEG with adjustable quality.\n\n#### Steps:\n\n- Use the `RenderTargetBitmap` class to render the canvas to a bitmap.\n- Encode the bitmap to the desired format (PNG or JPEG).\n- Save the encoded image to a file.\n\nHere's an example method to save the canvas as a PNG file:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void SaveAsPng()\n{\n    RenderTargetBitmap bitmap = new RenderTargetBitmap(\n        (int)drawingCanvas.ActualWidth,\n        (int)drawingCanvas.ActualHeight,\n        96, 96, PixelFormats.Pbgra32);\n    bitmap.Render(drawingCanvas);\n\n    PngBitmapEncoder encoder = new PngBitmapEncoder();\n    encoder.Frames.Add(BitmapFrame.Create(bitmap));\n\n    SaveFileDialog dialog = new SaveFileDialog\n    {\n        Filter = \"PNG Files (*.png)|*.png|All files (*.*)|*.*\",\n        DefaultExt = \".png\"\n    };\n\n    if (dialog.ShowDialog() == true)\n    {\n        using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(dialog.FileName, FileMode.Create))\n        {\n            encoder.Save(fs);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor JPEG with quality settings, you can adjust the `JpegBitmapEncoder.QualityLevel` property:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void SaveAsJpeg()\n{\n    RenderTargetBitmap bitmap = new RenderTargetBitmap(\n        (int)drawingCanvas.ActualWidth,\n        (int)drawingCanvas.ActualHeight,\n        96, 96, PixelFormats.Default);\n    bitmap.Render(drawingCanvas);\n\n    JpegBitmapEncoder encoder = new JpegBitmapEncoder();\n    encoder.QualityLevel = 85; // Set quality level (0-100)\n    encoder.Frames.Add(BitmapFrame.Create(bitmap));\n\n    SaveFileDialog dialog = new SaveFileDialog\n    {\n        Filter = \"JPEG Files (*.jpeg)|*.jpeg|All files (*.*)|*.*\",\n        DefaultExt = \".jpeg\"\n    };\n\n    if (dialog.ShowDialog() == true)\n    {\n        using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(dialog.FileName, FileMode.Create))\n        {\n            encoder.Save(fs);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can add UI elements like menu items or buttons to trigger these save functions, allowing users to choose between PNG and JPEG formats with options to set the quality for JPEG.\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\n- Set up your WPF project with a canvas for drawing.\n- Implement mouse event handlers to draw shapes.\n- Use the Command pattern to handle undo and redo operations.\n- Add functionality to save the canvas content as image files with adjustable quality for JPEG.\n\nThis should give you a solid foundation to build upon. You can further enhance the application by adding more features like different colors, brush styles, shape selection tools, and more.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any part of this project, feel free to ask!"
