        "content": "So the city usually gets an average of 45 inches of rain each year. But in this one special rainy year, they got 150% of that average. So, I need to find out what 150% of 45 inches is.\n\nFirst, I should remember what percent means. Percent is like per hundred, right? So 150% means 150 per 100, which is the same as 1.5 in decimal form. So, to find 150% of 45 inches, I can multiply 45 by 1.5.\n\nLet me write that down: Rainfall = 45 inches * 1.5.\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication. 45 times 1 is 45, and 45 times 0.5 is 22.5. So, 45 + 22.5 should give me the total rainfall for that year.\n\nAdding those up: 45 + 22.5 equals 67.5 inches.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? If they usually get 45 inches, and this year was 150% of that, then they should have gotten more rain than usual. 67.5 inches is more than 45 inches, so that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as they got the full average plus an additional 50%. So, 45 inches is 100%, and 50% of 45 is 22.5 inches. Adding that to the original 45 inches gives 67.5 inches again.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier. So, the city received 67.5 inches of rain during that particularly rainy year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{67.5} \\]"
