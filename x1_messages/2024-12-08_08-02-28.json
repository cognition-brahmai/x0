        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses in the village, and each house has either cats or dogs as pets. So, no house has both cats and dogs, I guess. Each cat owner has exactly 3 cats, and each dog owner has exactly 4 dogs. The total number of pets is 360. I need to find out how many houses have cats.\n\nLet me try to set this up with some variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of houses with cats.\n\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number of houses with dogs.\n\nSince there are 100 houses in total:\n\n\\[ c + d = 100 \\]\n\nEach cat house has 3 cats, so the total number of cats is \\( 3c \\).\n\nEach dog house has 4 dogs, so the total number of dogs is \\( 4d \\).\n\nThe total number of pets is 360, so:\n\n\\[ 3c + 4d = 360 \\]\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( c + d = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3c + 4d = 360 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( c \\). Maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let\u2019s try substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\[ d = 100 - c \\]\n\nNow, plug this into equation 2:\n\n\\[ 3c + 4(100 - c) = 360 \\]\n\nOkay, let's solve that:\n\n\\[ 3c + 400 - 4c = 360 \\]\n\n\\[ -c + 400 = 360 \\]\n\n\\[ -c = 360 - 400 \\]\n\n\\[ -c = -40 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 40 \\]\n\nSo, there are 40 houses with cats.\n\nWait, let me check that. If \\( c = 40 \\), then \\( d = 100 - 40 = 60 \\).\n\nTotal pets: \\( 3 \\times 40 + 4 \\times 60 = 120 + 240 = 360 \\). Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Let\u2019s see.\n\nSuppose all 100 houses had cats. Then, there would be \\( 3 \\times 100 = 300 \\) pets.\n\nBut actually, there are 360 pets, which is 60 more than 300.\n\nEach house that has dogs instead of cats adds one more pet, since dogs have 4 pets per house instead of 3.\n\nWait, no. If a house has dogs, it has 4 dogs instead of 3 cats. So, each such house adds an extra pet: 4 - 3 = 1 extra pet per house that has dogs instead of cats.\n\nSo, if all houses had cats, there would be 300 pets.\n\nBut there are 360 pets, which is 60 more than 300.\n\nSince each dog house adds one extra pet, there must be 60 dog houses.\n\nTherefore, \\( d = 60 \\), and \\( c = 100 - 60 = 40 \\).\n\nThat matches my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider all houses have dogs, then total pets would be \\( 4 \\times 100 = 400 \\).\n\nBut actually, there are 360 pets, which is 40 less than 400.\n\nEach cat house has 3 cats instead of 4 dogs, so each cat house reduces the total number of pets by one.\n\nTherefore, to account for the 40 fewer pets, there must be 40 cat houses.\n\nAgain, \\( c = 40 \\), \\( d = 60 \\).\n\nAll methods lead to the same answer. So, I\u2019m confident that the number of houses with cats is 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
