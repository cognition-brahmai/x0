        "content": "So there's this problem here about a small town with houses on both sides of the street, and I need to figure out the minimum number of people living there. Let's see: there are 20 houses on one side and 30 on the other, making a total of 50 houses. And it says every house has at least two residents. So, to find the minimum number of people, I should probably assume that each house has just the minimum number of residents, which is two.\n\nSo, if each of the 50 houses has at least two residents, then the minimum total number of people would be 50 houses times 2 residents per house, which is 100 people.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe there's a way to have fewer than 100 people. Let me think. The problem says \"every house has at least two residents,\" so no house can have fewer than two people. So, unless there's some other condition or constraint that I'm missing, 100 seems to be the minimum.\n\nLet me double-check. If I try to have some houses with more than two residents, that would only increase the total number of people, so that wouldn't help in finding the minimum. So, to minimize the total, I should have as many houses as possible with just the minimum number of residents, which is two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement of houses on different sides of the street matters, but the problem doesn't specify any difference between the two sides in terms of residents, so I think it's safe to treat all houses the same for this purpose.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the minimum number of people living in the street is 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
