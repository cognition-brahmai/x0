        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 boys and 18 girls in the classroom, so the total number of students is 12 + 18 = 30 students. Every student has at least one pencil, and there are 42 pencils in total. I need to find out how many students have more than one pencil.\n\nFirst, since every student has at least one pencil, that means 30 pencils are already accounted for (one for each student). Now, there are 42 pencils in total, so the extra pencils are 42 - 30 = 12 pencils.\n\nThese extra 12 pencils must be distributed among some of the students, meaning those students who receive these extra pencils will have more than one pencil. So, if I distribute these 12 extra pencils to 12 different students, each of those students will have one extra pencil, meaning they have two pencils each.\n\nBut perhaps some students have more than two pencils. However, to find the minimum number of students who have more than one pencil, I can assume that each of these extra pencils goes to a different student. Therefore, the number of students who have more than one pencil is equal to the number of extra pencils, which is 12.\n\nWait a minute, but if some students get more than one extra pencil, then the number of students with more than one pencil would be less than 12. For example, if one student gets all 12 extra pencils, then only that one student has more than one pencil.\n\nBut the question is probably expecting the minimum number of students who have more than one pencil, which would be 12, assuming each extra pencil goes to a different student.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum number of students who have more than one pencil, which would still be 12, because there are only 12 extra pencils to distribute.\n\nWait, no. The maximum number of students who have more than one pencil would be 12, if each of those students gets exactly one extra pencil. If fewer students get more extra pencils, then the number of students with more than one pencil would be less than 12.\n\nBut I think the question is asking for how many students have more than one pencil, given the total number of pencils is 42 and there are 30 students, each with at least one pencil.\n\nSo, the number of students who have more than one pencil is equal to the number of extra pencils, which is 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12 students have more than one pencil.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
