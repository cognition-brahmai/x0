        "content": "Let's see. The train is moving at a constant speed of 45 miles per hour, and we need to find out how far it goes in 2 hours and 30 minutes. Okay, first things first, I need to make sure that the time is in the same units as the speed. The speed is given in miles per hour, so it would be best to convert the time into hours.\n\nSo, 2 hours is straightforward, but what about the 30 minutes? I know that 60 minutes make an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, 2 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, the formula to calculate distance when speed and time are known is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 45 miles per hour \u00d7 2.5 hours\n\nMultiplying that gives:\n\nDistance = 112.5 miles\n\nSo, the train will travel 112.5 miles in 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how far the train goes in one hour, which is 45 miles, and then calculate for 2 hours, which would be 90 miles. Then, for the remaining 30 minutes, which is half an hour, the train would cover half of 45 miles, which is 22.5 miles. Adding that to the 90 miles gives again 112.5 miles.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way could be to convert everything into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 miles per hour is 45 miles per 60 minutes. Therefore, per minute, it's 45/60 miles, which simplifies to 0.75 miles per minute.\n\nNow, 2 hours and 30 minutes is 150 minutes (since 2 hours is 120 minutes plus 30 minutes).\n\nSo, distance would be 0.75 miles per minute times 150 minutes, which is 112.5 miles.\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that 112.5 miles is the correct answer.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. Is the train accelerating or decelerating? The question says it's traveling at a constant speed, so no acceleration or deceleration. Good.\n\nAlso, it's assuming that the speed is constant throughout the journey, which it is, according to the problem.\n\nSo, no need to worry about changes in speed.\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled is indeed 112.5 miles.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any unit conversion involved. The speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so no issue there.\n\nIf the units were different, I'd need to convert them, but in this case, it's all consistent.\n\nAlright, I think that's pretty much it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112.5 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
