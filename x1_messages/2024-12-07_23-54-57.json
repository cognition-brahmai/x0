        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to write a simple Java program that simulates a basic banking system. The program should allow users to create new bank accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, and print out account details including the current balance.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to structure this. Probably, the core component will be a class representing a bank account. This class should have properties like account number, account holder's name, and balance. It should also have methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and print account details.\n\nLet me sketch out the outline:\n\n1. **Account Class:**\n\n- Properties:\n\n- accountNumber (String)\n\n- accountHolderName (String)\n\n- balance (double)\n\n- Constructors:\n\n- A parameterized constructor to initialize accountNumber, accountHolderName, and balance.\n\n- Methods:\n\n- deposit(double amount): Adds the amount to the balance.\n\n- withdraw(double amount): Subtracts the amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n\n- printDetails(): Prints account number, account holder's name, and current balance.\n\n2. **BankingSystem Class:**\n\n- This will be the main class to run the program.\n\n- It will create instances of Account and handle user interactions.\n\nI need to decide how the user will interact with the program. Since this is a simple console application, I'll use Scanner to read inputs from the user.\n\nLet me think about the flow:\n\n- Start the program.\n\n- Prompt the user to create a new account by entering account number and holder's name.\n\n- Initialize the balance to zero.\n\n- Then, provide options to deposit, withdraw, or print account details.\n\n- Use a loop to allow multiple operations until the user decides to exit.\n\nI should also consider error handling, like entering negative amounts for deposits or withdrawals exceeding the balance.\n\nLet's start by defining the Account class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple banking system simulation in Java, we will develop a program that allows users to create bank accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, and print account details. This solution consists of two classes: `Account` and `BankingSystem`.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Account Class:**\n   - **Properties:** accountNumber (String), accountHolderName (String), balance (double).\n   - **Constructor:** Initializes accountNumber, accountHolderName, and balance.\n   - **Methods:**\n     - `deposit(double amount)`: Adds the amount to the balance.\n     - `withdraw(double amount)`: Subtracts the amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n     - `printDetails()`: Prints account number, account holder's name, and current balance.\n\n2. **BankingSystem Class:**\n   - **Main Class:** Handles user interactions using a Scanner for input.\n   - **Flow:**\n     - Prompts the user to create a new account by entering account number and holder's name.\n     - Initializes the balance to zero.\n     - Provides a menu for deposit, withdraw, print account details, and exit.\n     - Uses a loop to allow multiple operations until the user decides to exit.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\nclass Account {\n    private String accountNumber;\n    private String accountHolderName;\n    private double balance;\n\n    public Account(String accountNumber, String accountHolderName, double balance) {\n        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n        this.accountHolderName = accountHolderName;\n        this.balance = balance;\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n            System.out.println(\"Deposited: \" + amount);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid amount!\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            if (balance >= amount) {\n                balance -= amount;\n                System.out.println(\"Withdrew: \" + amount);\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Insufficient funds!\");\n            }\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid amount!\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void printDetails() {\n        System.out.println(\"Account Number: \" + accountNumber);\n        System.out.println(\"Account Holder Name: \" + accountHolderName);\n        System.out.println(\"Balance: \" + balance);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BankingSystem {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Create a new account\n        System.out.println(\"Welcome to Simple Bank!\");\n        System.out.print(\"Enter account number: \");\n        String accountNumber = scanner.nextLine();\n        System.out.print(\"Enter account holder's name: \");\n        String accountHolderName = scanner.nextLine();\n        Account account = new Account(accountNumber, accountHolderName, 0.0);\n\n        boolean exit = false;\n        while (!exit) {\n            System.out.println(\"\\nPlease select an option:\");\n            System.out.println(\"1. Deposit\");\n            System.out.println(\"2. Withdraw\");\n            System.out.println(\"3. Print Account Details\");\n            System.out.println(\"4. Exit\");\n            System.out.print(\"Enter choice (1-4): \");\n            int choice = scanner.nextInt();\n            scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n\n            switch (choice) {\n                case 1:\n                    System.out.print(\"Enter amount to deposit: \");\n                    double depositAmount = scanner.nextDouble();\n                    scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n                    account.deposit(depositAmount);\n                    break;\n                case 2:\n                    System.out.print(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \");\n                    double withdrawAmount = scanner.nextDouble();\n                    scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline\n                    account.withdraw(withdrawAmount);\n                    break;\n                case 3:\n                    account.printDetails();\n                    break;\n                case 4:\n                    System.out.println(\"Thank you for using Simple Bank!\");\n                    exit = true;\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Account Class:**\n   - Encapsulates account details and provides methods to deposit, withdraw, and print account information.\n   - Deposits and withdrawals include basic validation for amounts.\n\n2. **BankingSystem Class:**\n   - Manages user interactions through a menu-driven interface.\n   - Creates an account instance based on user input.\n   - Allows users to perform operations until they choose to exit.\n\nThis simple banking system provides a foundational structure that can be expanded with additional features like multiple accounts, transaction history, and enhanced error handling."
