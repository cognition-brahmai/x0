        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and they work 6 days a week. Each widget needs 3 screws and 4 bolts. So, I need to find out how many screws and bolts are needed for one week.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total number of widgets produced in a week. Since they produce 1000 widgets per day and work 6 days a week, the total weekly production is:\n\n1000 widgets/day * 6 days/week = 6000 widgets/week\n\nNow, each widget requires 3 screws. So, for 6000 widgets, the total number of screws needed is:\n\n3 screws/widget * 6000 widgets = 18,000 screws\n\nSimilarly, each widget requires 4 bolts. So, for 6000 widgets, the total number of bolts needed is:\n\n4 bolts/widget * 6000 widgets = 24,000 bolts\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 18,000 screws and 24,000 bolts for one week's production.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a easier way to think about it. If each widget needs 3 screws and 4 bolts, then per widget, the total fasteners needed are 3 + 4 = 7 fasteners.\n\nBut actually, screws and bolts are different, so maybe it's better to keep them separate. Anyway, I already calculated it separately, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the daily requirement and then multiply by the number of days in a week.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDaily production: 1000 widgets\n\nScrews per day: 1000 widgets * 3 screws/widget = 3000 screws\n\nBolts per day: 1000 widgets * 4 bolts/widget = 4000 bolts\n\nWeekly screws: 3000 screws/day * 6 days/week = 18,000 screws/week\n\nWeekly bolts: 4000 bolts/day * 6 days/week = 24,000 bolts/week\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total fasteners per widget, which is 3 screws + 4 bolts = 7 fasteners per widget.\n\nThen, for 6000 widgets, total fasteners would be 7 * 6000 = 42,000 fasteners.\n\nBut this includes both screws and bolts, so it's not separately useful. Better to keep them separate as per the question.\n\nSo, the factory needs 18,000 screws and 24,000 bolts per week.\n\nBut maybe they have some inventory or constraints, but based on the information given, this seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there are any leftovers from previous weeks or if there is any waste, but the question doesn't mention anything about that. So, assuming all widgets are assembled and no waste, my calculation should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory has some inventory, they might not need to procure all 18,000 screws and 24,000 bolts fresh every week, but again, the question doesn't specify any existing inventory.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the factory needs 18,000 screws and 24,000 bolts per week to maintain their production schedule.\n\nMaybe I can cross-validate this with another method.\n\nLet's think in terms of total fasteners needed per week.\n\nTotal fasteners per widget = 3 screws + 4 bolts = 7 fasteners\n\nTotal widgets per week = 6000\n\nTotal fasteners per week = 7 * 6000 = 42,000 fasteners\n\nNow, out of these, the proportion of screws is 3/7, and bolts is 4/7.\n\nSo, screws needed = (3/7) * 42,000 = 18,000 screws\n\nBolts needed = (4/7) * 42,000 = 24,000 bolts\n\nSame as before. So, this confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the daily fastener requirement:\n\nFasteners per widget = 7\n\nDaily production = 1000 widgets\n\nDaily fasteners = 7 * 1000 = 7,000 fasteners\n\nWeekly fasteners = 7,000 * 6 = 42,000 fasteners\n\nThen, screws = 3/7 * 42,000 = 18,000\n\nBolts = 4/7 * 42,000 = 24,000\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nMaybe another way: think in terms of ratios.\n\nFor every widget, the ratio of screws to bolts is 3:4.\n\nTotal parts per widget is 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nTotal widgets per week is 6000.\n\nSo, total screws = (3/7) * total parts\n\nTotal bolts = (4/7) * total parts\n\nTotal parts = 7 * 6000 = 42,000\n\nSo, screws = 3/7 * 42,000 = 18,000\n\nBolts = 4/7 * 42,000 = 24,000\n\nOnce more, same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently through multiple methods.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 18,000 screws and 24,000 bolts per week to maintain their production schedule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18000 \\text{ screws and } 24000 \\text{ bolts}} \\]"
