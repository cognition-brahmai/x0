        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A per day. If it operates at full capacity for 25 days in a month, I need to find out how many units are produced in a year.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many units are produced in one month. Since it produces 500 units per day and operates for 25 days in a month, I can multiply 500 by 25 to get the monthly production.\n\nSo, 500 units/day * 25 days/month = 12,500 units/month.\n\nNow, to find out the annual production, I need to multiply the monthly production by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:\n\n12,500 units/month * 12 months/year = 150,000 units/year.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there any other factor I need to consider? Like holidays or maintenance days that might affect the operating days.\n\nThe question says the factory operates at full capacity for 25 days in a month. So, I assume that's the standard operation schedule, and I don't need to account for additional days off.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider that some months might have more or fewer operating days due to various reasons. However, since the question specifies 25 days per month, I'll stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the annual production based on the number of days in a year the factory operates.\n\nThere are 12 months in a year, each operating 25 days, so total operating days in a year would be:\n\n25 days/month * 12 months/year = 300 days/year.\n\nThen, multiplying the daily production by the total operating days in a year:\n\n500 units/day * 300 days/year = 150,000 units/year.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider another approach. If the factory operates 25 days a month, and there are 12 months in a year, that's 300 days. But actually, some months have more days than others, but since it's specified as 25 days per month, I should stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate based on the actual number of days in each month, it might vary, but the question simplifies it by giving a consistent 25 days per month.\n\nTherefore, the annual production is 150,000 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]"
