        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 10 boxes, each with some number of balls, and the total number of balls in all the boxes adds up to 100. I can distribute the balls any way I want among the boxes. The task is to choose the maximum number of boxes such that the total number of balls in those boxes is less than or equal to 50.\n\nHmm, interesting. Since I can distribute the balls any way I like, I have a lot of flexibility here. I need to maximize the number of boxes chosen, but at the same time, ensure that the sum of the balls in those boxes doesn't exceed 50.\n\nLet me think about this. If I want to choose as many boxes as possible, I should probably try to minimize the number of balls in each box. That way, I can pick more boxes without exceeding the total of 50 balls.\n\nWait a minute, but if I minimize the number of balls in each box, say, by putting one ball in each box, then I can pick up to 50 boxes if there were enough boxes. But there are only 10 boxes, so in that case, I could pick all 10 boxes, each with one ball, totaling 10 balls, which is less than 50. But maybe I can do better than that.\n\nWait, no. If I have 10 boxes, each with one ball, total is 10, which is way below 50. But I need to maximize the number of boxes chosen, given that their total is <=50.\n\nMaybe I should distribute the balls so that as many boxes as possible have a small number of balls, but without making them all equal necessarily.\n\nLet me consider this: suppose I have nine boxes with one ball each, and the tenth box with 91 balls (since 9*1 + 1*91 = 100). If I choose the nine boxes with one ball each, the total is 9, which is less than 50. So I can choose 9 boxes.\n\nBut maybe I can do better. What if I have eight boxes with one ball, one box with two balls, and one box with 90 balls? Choosing the eight boxes with one ball and the one with two balls gives a total of 10 balls, still less than 50. So I can choose 9 boxes again.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Not better.\n\nWhat if I have seven boxes with one ball, two boxes with two balls, and one box with 85 balls? Choosing the seven boxes with one ball and the two with two balls gives a total of 11 balls. Still less than 50, so I can choose 9 boxes.\n\nHmm, seems like choosing nine boxes with small numbers of balls adds up to less than 50.\n\nBut the problem allows me to choose up to 10 boxes, but if I make the tenth box have a lot of balls, choosing it would make the total exceed 50.\n\nSo, for example, if I have ten boxes with ten balls each, total is 100. If I choose five boxes, that's 50 balls, which is exactly 50. But I can't choose six boxes because that would be 60 balls, which is over 50.\n\nBut in this case, I can only choose five boxes.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I had nine boxes with one ball and one with 91, I could choose nine boxes with a total of nine balls.\n\nSo, by making the majority of the boxes have very few balls, and one box have a lot, I can choose more boxes without exceeding 50.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to minimize the number of balls in as many boxes as possible, so that I can choose them all without exceeding 50.\n\nBut, in the extreme case, if I have nine boxes with one ball each and one box with 91, choosing the nine boxes gives nine balls, which is less than 50.\n\nAlternatively, if I have eight boxes with one ball, one box with two balls, and one box with 90, choosing the eight ones and the two-ball box gives ten balls.\n\nSimilarly, seven boxes with one, two boxes with two balls, and one with 85: total of eleven balls.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum number of boxes I can choose such that their total is <=50.\n\nIn the first scenario, with nine boxes of one ball and one of 91, I can choose nine boxes for a total of nine balls.\n\nIn the second, eight boxes of one and one of two, and one of 90: choosing eight ones and one two gives ten balls.\n\nIn the third, seven ones, two twos, and one 85: total of eleven balls.\n\nBut, perhaps I can distribute the balls in such a way that more boxes have higher numbers of balls, but still allow me to choose more boxes without exceeding 50.\n\nWait, for example, if I have ten boxes, each with five balls, total is 50. Then, I can choose all ten boxes, and the total is exactly 50.\n\nThat seems ideal. I choose all ten boxes, and the total is 50.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait, but 10 boxes with five balls each would total 50, which is exactly 50.\n\nBut the problem states that the total number of balls across all boxes is 100.\n\nSo, if I have ten boxes with five balls each, that's 50 balls, but I need a total of 100 balls.\n\nOh, right, I misread that.\n\nSo, the total across all boxes is 100, and I can distribute them any way I like.\n\nWait, but in the previous scenarios, I had nine boxes with one ball and one with 91, or eight with one, one with two, and one with 90, etc.\n\nBut in those cases, I could choose up to nine boxes with a small total.\n\nBut I need to maximize the number of boxes chosen, with the sum of their balls <=50.\n\nSo, perhaps choosing nine boxes with a total of, say, nine balls is possible, but maybe I can choose more boxes if some of them have zero balls.\n\nWait, can boxes have zero balls?\n\nThe problem says \"some number of balls,\" which could include zero.\n\nBut, if I have boxes with zero balls, that might help me choose more boxes without increasing the total.\n\nWait, but if a box has zero balls, choosing it doesn't add to the total.\n\nSo, perhaps I can have some boxes with zero balls.\n\nBut, if I have boxes with zero balls, that would allow me to choose more boxes without increasing the total beyond 50.\n\nFor example, if I have ten boxes: nine with zero balls and one with 100 balls, then choosing the nine empty boxes gives a total of zero, which is <=50.\n\nBut I can choose nine boxes.\n\nBut I need to maximize the number of boxes chosen.\n\nAlternatively, if I have eight boxes with zero balls, one box with one ball, and one box with 91 balls, choosing the eight zero-ball boxes and the one-ball box gives a total of one ball, which is <=50.\n\nSo, I can choose nine boxes.\n\nWait, but I can do better.\n\nWhat if I have ten boxes, nine with one ball each, and one with 91 balls.\n\nChoosing the nine boxes with one ball gives a total of nine, which is <=50.\n\nSo, I can choose nine boxes.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about having boxes with zero balls, but that doesn't seem to help me choose more than nine boxes, since there are only ten boxes in total.\n\nWait, but I can't choose all ten boxes if one of them has 91 balls, because including that box would make the total 91 + 9 = 100, which is over 50.\n\nSo, to choose all ten boxes, their total would be 100, which is over 50.\n\nTherefore, I can't choose all ten boxes.\n\nSo, the maximum number of boxes I can choose is nine.\n\nBut, is there a way to distribute the balls such that I can choose all ten boxes and have their total <=50?\n\nOnly if the total in all boxes is <=50, but the problem states that the total in all boxes is 100.\n\nSo, it's impossible to choose all ten boxes without exceeding 50.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes I can choose is nine.\n\nBut, to confirm, let's consider distributing the balls in such a way that nine boxes have a total of 50 balls, and the tenth box has 50 balls.\n\nWait, but 50 + 50 is 100, which matches the total.\n\nThen, if I choose the nine boxes with 50 balls, their total is 50, which is exactly 50.\n\nAnd if I try to choose the tenth box with 50 balls, that would also be 50, but choosing any additional boxes would exceed 50.\n\nBut in this case, I can choose nine boxes with a total of 50, or choose one box with 50 balls.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize the number of boxes chosen, so choosing nine boxes with a total of 50 is better than choosing one box with 50 balls.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes I can choose is nine.\n\nBut, is there a way to choose nine boxes with a total <=50?\n\nWait, in the earlier example, if I have nine boxes with five balls each, that's 45 balls, and one box with 55 balls.\n\nThen, choosing the nine boxes with five balls each gives 45, which is <=50.\n\nAlternatively, choosing eight boxes with five balls and the one with 55 would be 40 + 55 = 95, which is over 50.\n\nSo, in this case, I can choose nine boxes with a total of 45.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of choosing nine boxes with one ball each, totaling nine, which is also <=50.\n\nSo, in both cases, I can choose nine boxes.\n\nBut the question is, can I choose more than nine boxes?\n\nWell, there are only ten boxes in total.\n\nSo, the maximum number of boxes I can choose is nine, leaving out one box.\n\nBut, perhaps if I have more boxes with zero balls, I can choose more boxes.\n\nWait, but if I have boxes with zero balls, that allows me to choose more boxes without increasing the total.\n\nFor example, if I have nine boxes with zero balls and one box with 100 balls, choosing the nine zero-ball boxes gives a total of zero, which is <=50.\n\nSimilarly, if I have eight boxes with zero balls, one box with one ball, and one box with 92 balls, choosing the eight zero-ball boxes and the one-ball box gives a total of one, which is <=50.\n\nSo, in this case, I can choose nine boxes.\n\nBut again, I'm still choosing nine boxes.\n\nIt seems that the maximum number of boxes I can choose is nine, since choosing all ten boxes would include the box with 92 balls, making the total 93, which is over 50.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be nine.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nSuppose I distribute the balls such that ten boxes have ten balls each, totaling 100.\n\nThen, choosing five boxes gives 50 balls, which is exactly 50.\n\nChoosing six boxes gives 60, which is over 50.\n\nSo, in this case, I can choose five boxes.\n\nBut earlier, with nine boxes having one ball and one having 91, I could choose nine boxes with nine balls.\n\nSimilarly, with nine zero-ball boxes and one with 100, I can choose nine boxes with zero balls.\n\nIn both cases, choosing nine boxes gives a total that is <=50.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes I can choose is nine.\n\nBut, to confirm, let's see if there's a distribution where choosing nine boxes gives a total >50.\n\nFor example, if I have nine boxes with six balls each, totaling 54, and one box with 46 balls.\n\nThen, choosing nine boxes gives 54, which is over 50.\n\nBut the problem states that the sum should be <=50.\n\nTherefore, in this case, I cannot choose nine boxes.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the sum of the balls in those chosen boxes is less than or equal to 50.\"\n\nSo, in this distribution, choosing nine boxes gives 54, which is over 50, so I cannot choose nine boxes.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the number of boxes chosen with a sum <=50, I need to ensure that the sum of the nine boxes is <=50.\n\nSo, in the earlier distribution where nine boxes have one ball each and one has 91, choosing the nine boxes gives nine balls, which is <=50.\n\nSimilarly, with nine boxes having five balls each and one having 55, choosing nine boxes gives 45, which is <=50.\n\nAlternatively, with nine boxes having zero balls and one having 100, choosing nine boxes gives zero, which is <=50.\n\nIn all these cases, I can choose nine boxes with a sum <=50.\n\nBut if I try to choose ten boxes, the sum would be 100, which is over 50.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes I can choose is nine.\n\nHence, the answer is nine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
