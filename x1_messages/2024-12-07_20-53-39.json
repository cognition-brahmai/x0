        "content": "I'm trying to figure out this riddle: \"Goes over all the hills and hollows. Bites hard, but never swallows.\" Hmm, riddles can be tricky because they often use metaphors and play with words. Let's break it down piece by piece.\n\nFirst part: \"Goes over all the hills and hollows.\" This suggests something that moves across various terrains, maybe even uneven ones. It could be something that traverses landscapes, possibly naturally or mechanically.\n\nSecond part: \"Bites hard, but never swallows.\" This implies something that grasps or holds on firmly but doesn't consume or take in whatever it bites.\n\nCombining these two parts, I need to think of something that moves over diverse terrains and has a biting mechanism without swallowing.\n\nLet me consider natural phenomena first. Maybe something like a glacier that moves over hills and hollows, but I don't think glaciers bite or grasp anything. Weather patterns could traverse different terrains, but they don't really bite.\n\nPerhaps it's an animal. An animal that moves across various terrains and bites without swallowing. That seems unusual because most biting animals do swallow their prey. Maybe it's a plant, like a venus flytrap, but plants don't really go over hills and hollows.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a living thing. Maybe it's a tool or a machine. Something mechanical that moves over different terrains and bites without swallowing.\n\nLet's think about vehicles. A tank, for example, goes over hills and hollows with its tracks, and it has treads that could be seen as biting into the ground without swallowing.\n\nAlternatively, think about a plow. A plow goes over fields, which could include hills and hollows, and it bites into the soil to turn it over without swallowing it.\n\nAnother possibility is a hammer. A hammer doesn't go over hills and hollows, though. It's more stationary in its use.\n\nWait, perhaps it's something that moves and bites in a more figurative sense. Like time, which goes over all terrains and bites hard in the sense that it affects everything, but doesn't swallow, meaning it doesn't consume or destroy, just changes.\n\nBut that seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's something more concrete.\n\nLet me think about elements. Wind goes over hills and hollows, bites hard in storms, but doesn't swallow.\n\nBut wind can displace things, maybe that's a form of swallowing. Not sure.\n\nWater also flows over terrains, bites at soil in erosion, but again, it carries things away, which could be seen as swallowing.\n\nMaybe it's fire. Fire spreads over landscapes, bites at materials, but doesn't swallow them; it consumes them, which is different.\n\nWait, no, consuming is similar to swallowing. So that might not fit.\n\nPerhaps it's a type of vehicle specifically designed for rough terrains, like a bulldozer. A bulldozer goes over hills and hollows, bites into the ground with its blade, but doesn't swallow anything.\n\nThat seems promising. It fits both parts of the riddle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a train. Train tracks go over various terrains, and the train bites into the tracks with its wheels without swallowing.\n\nBut that might be a stretch.\n\nAnother angle: could it be a bird? A bird flies over hills and hollows and bites with its beak without swallowing. But most birds do swallow their food, so that doesn't fully fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a mosquito. A mosquito flies over different terrains, bites, but doesn't swallow; it sucks blood. But I'm not sure if \"swallows\" here means consuming in general or specifically swallowing something.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a zipper. A zipper goes over the edges of clothes, bites into the fabric without swallowing.\n\nThat's creative, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider everyday objects. A pair of scissors goes over different materials, bites into them to cut, but doesn't swallow.\n\nInteresting, but scissors don't typically go over hills and hollows.\n\nWait, maybe it's teeth. Teeth bite hard but don't swallow; that's the role of the throat.\n\nBut teeth don't go over hills and hollows.\n\nUnless it's metaphorical, like wisdom teeth that traverse the journey of life, but that seems too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a key. A key goes into locks, bites into the tumblers without swallowing.\n\nAgain, not sure.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the answer is something that is both mobile and has a biting mechanism, but doesn't consume.\n\nA robot comes to mind. A robot can traverse various terrains, have pincers or claws that bite without swallowing.\n\nBut that seems too broad, as there are many types of robots.\n\nMaybe it's a specific tool, like pliers. Pliers can be moved over work areas, bite into objects without swallowing.\n\nBut pliers don't typically go over hills and hollows.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mountain goat. Mountain goats go over hills and hollows, and they have teeth that bite but don't swallow?\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because all animals swallow their food.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a snake, which can traverse various terrains, bites with fangs, but doesn't necessarily swallow immediately.\n\nBut snakes do swallow their prey eventually.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider non-living things again. Maybe it's ice, like an iceberg or glacier that moves over terrains, bites into the land, but doesn't swallow.\n\nBut glaciers do erode the land over time, which could be seen as swallowing, I guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of saw. A saw goes over wood or other materials, bites into them without swallowing.\n\nBut again, saws don't typically go over hills and hollows unless it's being carried by someone.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a bird's beak, but that's similar to teeth.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a farmer with a sickle, going over the fields, biting the crops without swallowing.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nAnother thought: could it be a storm or a hurricane, which goes over terrains, bites with strong winds, but doesn't swallow.\n\nBut storms do carry things away sometimes, which could be considered swallowing.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe the answer is something that is both mobile and has a biting mechanism, but doesn't consume or swallow anything.\n\nPerhaps it's a clamp or a vice. A vice doesn't move over terrains, though.\n\nWait, maybe it's a vehicle with pincers or a grabber, like a construction vehicle that moves over rough terrains, bites into objects with its pincers without swallowing them.\n\nThat could be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of animal that bites but doesn't swallow, but I can't think of any animal that bites just for biting's sake without intending to eat.\n\nUnless it's a defensive mechanism, like a biting insect that doesn't swallow.\n\nBut again, insects that bite typically feed on blood, which they do swallow.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe the answer is something completely different. Perhaps it's a type of natural feature, like a cliff that juts out and \"bites\" into the landscape without swallowing anything.\n\nBut that seems too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of plant that grows over terrains and has thorns or biting leaves, but plants don't really move over terrains; they grow into them.\n\nWait, vines can climb over structures, but they don't bite in the traditional sense.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe I need to look at the phrase \"bites hard, but never swallows\" more symbolically.\n\nCould it be time, which bites at us with its passage but doesn't swallow us until we die?\n\nThat's a bit morbid and not sure if it fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's memory, which bites hard but never swallows, meaning it holds on tightly but doesn't consume experiences.\n\nThat's also quite abstract.\n\nPerhaps the answer is a plow, as I thought earlier, but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a sawblade on a chainsaw that goes over tree trunks and other surfaces, bites into them without swallowing.\n\nBut again, that might not fit perfectly.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of animal that moves over terrains and bites, but doesn't swallow because it's not a predator or doesn't eat what it bites.\n\nFor example, a horse that bites at grass but doesn't necessarily swallow everything it bites.\n\nBut horses do swallow the grass they eat.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mosquito that bites but doesn't swallow; it feeds on blood.\n\nBut mosquitoes do swallow blood, don't they?\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nLet me consider if there's a play on words here. \"Bites hard, but never swallows.\" Maybe it's something that grasps or holds on firmly without consuming.\n\nCould it be a pier or a dock that sticks out into the water, bites into the shore without swallowing the water?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of fastener, like a bolt or a screw, that bites into materials without swallowing them.\n\nBut bolts and screws don't typically move over hills and hollows.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of vehicle used in construction or mining that has biting mechanisms, like an excavator, which moves over rough terrains, bites into the ground to dig without swallowing the earth.\n\nThat could be a possible answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a type of agricultural machine, like a harrow, which is dragged over fields, bites into the soil to break it up without swallowing anything.\n\nThat seems to fit the description quite well.\n\nLet me see: a harrow is a farm implement that is dragged over plowed land to break up clods, remove weeds, and smooth the surface. It goes over hills and hollows, depending on the terrain, and its teeth or tines bite into the soil without swallowing anything.\n\nThis seems to align well with the riddle's description.\n\nAnother possibility is a plow itself, which also goes over terrains, bites into the soil to turn it over, but doesn't swallow anything.\n\nHowever, the harrow might be a better fit because it specifically bites into the soil to break it up without consuming it, whereas a plow turns over the soil.\n\nBut both could be potential answers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of garden tool, like a cultivator, which is moved over soil, bites into it to loosen and aerate without swallowing.\n\nSimilar to a harrow, but on a smaller scale.\n\nGiven that, I think the most fitting answer to the riddle \"Goes over all the hills and hollows. Bites hard, but never swallows\" is a harrow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{harrow}} \\]"
