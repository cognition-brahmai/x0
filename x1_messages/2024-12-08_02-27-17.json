It returns a list of potential sources containing relevant information.\nArticleReader[input]: This tool reads articles from given URLs and extracts their text content.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQAmodel[input]: A tool that can answer questions based on general knowledge or given context. The input must be a question referencing one or more :evidence[n]: variables.\n\nEach plan should correspond with exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [first action]\n#E1 = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function call with input parameter, possibly referencing previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the history of the Eiffel Tower and who were its main architects?"
