        "content": "The term you're referring to is \"yacht.\" In the context of boats, a yacht is a luxury vessel used for recreation or racing. However, in U.S. politics, the term \"yacht\" is sometimes used metaphorically to describe individuals who are involved in steering the \"ship of state,\" meaning they play a significant role in governing or influencing political decisions.\n\nThis metaphorical use likens the complexities and navigational challenges of governing a nation to sailing a ship, where those in power are the ones steering it through turbulent political waters. So, in this sense, a \"yacht\" in politics would be someone who holds a position of authority or influence, helping to direct the course of the nation.\n\nIt's worth noting that the term \"yacht\" in politics isn't as commonly used as other nautical metaphors, such as \"helmsman\" or \"captain,\" which more directly refer to leaders like presidents or prime ministers. However, the idea of political figures being akin to sailors guiding a ship is a recurrent theme in political rhetoric and analysis."
