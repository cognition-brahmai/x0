        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the top 3 employees with the highest salaries in each department from the 'Employee' table, which has columns 'Name', 'Department', and 'Salary'. This requires us to partition the data by department and then rank employees within each department based on their salaries.\n\nOne efficient way to achieve this in SQL is by using the `DENSE_RANK()` window function. This function assigns a rank to each row within a partition of a result set, with no gaps in the ranking values. Here's how we can structure the query:\n\n1. Use the `DENSE_RANK()` function to rank employees within each department based on their salary in descending order.\n2. Select the top 3 ranks for each department.\n3. Retrieve the required fields: 'Name', 'Department', and 'Salary'.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name, Department, Salary\nFROM (\n    SELECT Name, Department, Salary,\n           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) as salary_rank\n    FROM Employee\n) ranked_employees\nWHERE salary_rank <= 3;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Subquery (ranked_employees):**\n   - We select all columns from the 'Employee' table.\n   - We use the `DENSE_RANK()` window function to assign a rank to each employee within their department, ordering by salary in descending order.\n   - The `PARTITION BY Department` clause ensures that the ranking is reset for each department.\n\n2. **Outer Query:**\n   - We select the 'Name', 'Department', and 'Salary' columns from the subquery.\n   - We filter the results to include only those rows where the 'salary_rank' is less than or equal to 3, effectively getting the top 3 employees in each department based on salary.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately identify the top earners in each department, even if there are departments with fewer than 3 employees."
