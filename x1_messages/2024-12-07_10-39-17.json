        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B each day. It works 20 days every month. We need to find out how many units of A and B are made in one whole year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in a month for each product and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.\n\nLet me start with product A. It produces 500 units per day, and it works 20 days a month. So, monthly production for A would be:\n\n500 units/day * 20 days/month = 10,000 units/month\n\nSimilarly, for product B:\n\n300 units/day * 20 days/month = 6,000 units/month\n\nNow, there are 12 months in a year, so for product A:\n\n10,000 units/month * 12 months/year = 120,000 units/year\n\nAnd for product B:\n\n6,000 units/month * 12 months/year = 72,000 units/year\n\nSo, in one year, the factory produces 120,000 units of product A and 72,000 units of product B.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe calculate the total production per day for both products and then multiply by the number of operating days in a year.\n\nLet's see:\n\nTotal daily production = 500 (A) + 300 (B) = 800 units/day\n\nNow, the factory operates 20 days per month, and there are 12 months, so total operating days in a year are:\n\n20 days/month * 12 months/year = 240 days/year\n\nSo, total annual production would be:\n\n800 units/day * 240 days/year = 192,000 units/year\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated separately, I got 120,000 for A and 72,000 for B, which adds up to 192,000 units/year. So, that matches.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there are any holidays or days when the factory doesn't operate. The problem says it operates 20 days per month, so probably that already accounts for holidays.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the number of months in a year is 12. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the monthly production and then multiply by 12.\n\nFor product A:\n\n500 units/day * 20 days/month = 10,000 units/month\n\n10,000 units/month * 12 months/year = 120,000 units/year\n\nSimilarly for product B:\n\n300 units/day * 20 days/month = 6,000 units/month\n\n6,000 units/month * 12 months/year = 72,000 units/year\n\nTotal: 120,000 + 72,000 = 192,000 units/year\n\nWait a minute, but I think the question is asking for the number of units of products A and B produced in one year, separately.\n\nSo, perhaps I should present the answers for A and B individually, not just the total.\n\nSo, product A: 120,000 units/year\n\nProduct B: 72,000 units/year\n\nTotal production: 192,000 units/year\n\nBut maybe the question wants them separately.\n\nLooking back, it says \"how many units of products A and B are produced in one year?\"\n\nSo, probably it's expecting both amounts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it wants the total, but it's worded in a way that suggests separately.\n\nTo be safe, I'll provide both.\n\nSo, the factory produces 120,000 units of product A and 72,000 units of product B in one year, for a total of 192,000 units.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if there's any downtime or if the factory operates every month at the same rate.\n\nThe problem says it operates 20 days per month, and doesn't mention any variations between months, so assuming it's constant.\n\nAlso, it's probably operating the same number of days each month, without considering weekends or anything like that, since it's specified as 20 days per month.\n\nSo, my calculations should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the annual production by considering the daily production and then multiplying by the total number of operating days in a year.\n\nAs I did earlier: 800 units/day * 240 days/year = 192,000 units/year.\n\nAnd separately, 500 units/day for A * 240 days/year = 120,000 units/year.\n\n300 units/day for B * 240 days/year = 72,000 units/year.\n\nYes, that matches what I had before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the final answer is 120,000 units of product A and 72,000 units of product B produced in one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120000 \\text{ units of product A and } 72000 \\text{ units of product B per year}} \\]\n"
