        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units every day, and each unit sells for $25. We need to find out the total revenue for one week. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many units are produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and the factory produces 500 units each day, I can calculate the total units produced in a week by multiplying 500 by 7.\n\nSo, 500 units/day * 7 days/week = 3500 units/week.\n\nNext, each unit sells for $25, so to find the total revenue, I need to multiply the number of units produced in a week by the selling price per unit.\n\nThat would be 3500 units * $25/unit.\n\nNow, 3500 multiplied by 25. Let me do the math.\n\n25 times 3000 is 75,000, and 25 times 500 is 12,500. So, 75,000 plus 12,500 equals 87,500.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue generated in one week is $87,500.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe by calculating the daily revenue first and then multiplying by 7.\n\nDaily revenue would be 500 units * $25/unit = $12,500 per day.\n\nThen, for a week, $12,500/day * 7 days/week = $87,500/week.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, $87,500 is the total revenue for one week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other factors to consider. Is there any information about production costs, overheads, or other expenses? The question only asks for revenue, so I don't need to account for those. Revenue is simply the income from sales before any expenses are deducted.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The production is per day, and the selling price is per unit, so multiplying them correctly gives the total revenue.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory operates every day of the week. The question says \"every day,\" so I assume it operates seven days a week. If it didn't, I would need to adjust the number of days accordingly.\n\nBut based on the information provided, my calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the total revenue generated in one week is $87,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{87500} \\]"
