        "content": "Let's see. So, the city has a total population of 120,000 people. Out of these, 35% are children, 50% are adults, and 15% are senior citizens. I need to find out how many more adults there are compared to children.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many children and how many adults there are in the city. Then, I can subtract the number of children from the number of adults to find the difference.\n\nSo, to find the number of children, I can calculate 35% of 120,000. Similarly, for adults, it's 50% of 120,000.\n\nLet me start with the children:\n\n35% of 120,000 is calculated as (35/100) * 120,000.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n35 divided by 100 is 0.35.\n\nThen, 0.35 multiplied by 120,000 is:\n\n0.35 * 120,000 = 42,000.\n\nSo, there are 42,000 children in the city.\n\nNow, for adults:\n\n50% of 120,000 is (50/100) * 120,000.\n\n50 divided by 100 is 0.50.\n\n0.50 multiplied by 120,000 is:\n\n0.50 * 120,000 = 60,000.\n\nSo, there are 60,000 adults in the city.\n\nNow, to find out how many more adults there are than children, I need to subtract the number of children from the number of adults:\n\n60,000 - 42,000 = 18,000.\n\nTherefore, there are 18,000 more adults than children in the city.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the percentage of children: 35% of 120,000.\n\n35% of 120,000:\n\n(35/100) * 120,000 = 0.35 * 120,000 = 42,000. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adults: 50% of 120,000.\n\n(50/100) * 120,000 = 0.50 * 120,000 = 60,000. That also seems correct.\n\nNow, the difference:\n\n60,000 - 42,000 = 18,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the percentages directly.\n\nThe difference in percentages between adults and children is 50% - 35% = 15%.\n\nSo, 15% of 120,000 should give me the difference.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n15% of 120,000 is (15/100) * 120,000 = 0.15 * 120,000 = 18,000.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, there are 18,000 more adults than children in the city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18000} \\]"
