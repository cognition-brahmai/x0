        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we know that the town has a total population of 1,200 people. Out of these, 60% are adults. So, to find out how many adults there are, I need to calculate 60% of 1,200.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n60% of 1,200 is calculated as (60/100) * 1,200.\n\nThat simplifies to 0.6 * 1,200, which equals 720 adults.\n\nSo, there are 720 adults in the town.\n\nNow, among these adults, 40% have children. I need to find out how many adults have children and then subtract that number from the total number of adults to find out how many adults do not have children.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many adults have children.\n\n40% of 720 adults have children.\n\nSo, that's (40/100) * 720.\n\nWhich is 0.4 * 720, equaling 288 adults.\n\nTherefore, 288 adults have children.\n\nNow, to find out how many adults do not have children, I subtract the number of adults who have children from the total number of adults.\n\nSo, 720 adults - 288 adults = 432 adults.\n\nTherefore, 432 adults do not have children.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the total population: 1,200 people.\n\n60% are adults: 0.6 * 1,200 = 720 adults.\n\n40% of these adults have children: 0.4 * 720 = 288 adults with children.\n\nSo, adults without children: 720 - 288 = 432.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages.\n\nIf 40% of adults have children, then the remaining 60% of adults do not have children.\n\nSo, 60% of 720 adults do not have children.\n\nThat would be (60/100) * 720 = 0.6 * 720 = 432 adults without children.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 432 adults do not have children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{432} \\]"
