        "content": "So the city is planning to add 50 new buses over the next five years to upgrade its public transportation system. Each bus can hold up to 60 passengers and will operate for 12 hours a day, with an average trip time of 30 minutes. The city's population is 1 million and is growing at 2% per year. I need to calculate the total number of trips that can be made daily after all buses are added and estimate what percentage of the population can be served by this upgraded system in the fifth year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many trips each bus can make in a day. Since each bus operates for 12 hours a day and each trip takes 30 minutes, I can calculate the number of trips per bus per day.\n\nThere are 12 hours in the operating time, and each hour has 60 minutes, so total minutes per day is:\n\n12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes\n\nEach trip is 30 minutes, so the number of trips per bus per day is:\n\n720 minutes / 30 minutes/trip = 24 trips/bus/day\n\nNow, with 50 buses, the total number of trips per day would be:\n\n50 buses * 24 trips/bus/day = 1200 trips/day\n\nEach trip can accommodate up to 60 passengers, so the total number of passengers that can be transported per day is:\n\n1200 trips/day * 60 passengers/trip = 72,000 passengers/day\n\nNext, I need to estimate the population in the fifth year. The current population is 1 million, and it's growing at 2% annually. The formula for population after n years is:\n\nPopulation = P * (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- P is the initial population\n\n- r is the growth rate\n\n- n is the number of years\n\nSo, population in the fifth year:\n\nPopulation = 1,000,000 * (1 + 0.02)^5\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.02)^5:\n\n(1.02)^5 \u2248 1.10408\n\nSo, population in the fifth year:\n\n1,000,000 * 1.10408 = 1,104,080\n\nNow, to find the percentage of the population that can be served by this upgraded transportation system daily, I need to divide the total number of passengers that can be transported per day by the population in the fifth year and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nPercentage served = (72,000 / 1,104,080) * 100\n\nFirst, divide 72,000 by 1,104,080:\n\n72,000 / 1,104,080 \u2248 0.0652\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.0652 * 100 \u2248 6.52%\n\nSo, approximately 6.52% of the population can be served by the upgraded transportation system daily in the fifth year.\n\nWait a minute, does this percentage make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, number of trips per bus per day:\n\n12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes\n\n720 minutes / 30 minutes/trip = 24 trips/bus/day\n\nWith 50 buses:\n\n50 buses * 24 trips/bus/day = 1,200 trips/day\n\nEach trip carries 60 passengers:\n\n1,200 trips/day * 60 passengers/trip = 72,000 passengers/day\n\nPopulation in year 5:\n\n1,000,000 * (1.02)^5 \u2248 1,000,000 * 1.10408 = 1,104,080\n\nPercentage served:\n\n(72,000 / 1,104,080) * 100 \u2248 6.52%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that some passengers might take multiple trips in a day. But the question asks for the total number of trips that can be made daily and the percentage of the population that can be served.\n\nGiven that, my approach seems valid.\n\nSo, the total number of trips that can be made daily after all buses are added is 1,200 trips, and the percentage of the population that can be served by this upgraded transportation system in the fifth year is approximately 6.52%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total number of trips that can be made daily after all buses are added is \\boxed{1200}, and the percentage of the population that can be served by this upgraded transportation system in the fifth year is approximately \\boxed{6.52\\%}."
