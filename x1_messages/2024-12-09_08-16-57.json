They are small insects that typically live outdoors and feed on plants. If an earwig were to accidentally crawl into someone's ear, it would likely be by mistake. If you have concerns about earwigs or any other insects, it's best to consult with a professional pest control service for guidance on prevention and control methods.\n"
