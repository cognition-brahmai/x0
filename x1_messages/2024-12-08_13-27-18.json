        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria doubling every 4 hours. Starting with 100 bacteria, I need to figure out how many there will be after 24 hours. Hmm, exponential growth, right? Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that exponential growth can be modeled by the formula:\n\n\\[N = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(N\\) is the final amount,\n\n- \\(N_0\\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\(t\\) is the time elapsed,\n\n- \\(T\\) is the doubling time.\n\nIn this case, \\(N_0\\) is 100, \\(T\\) is 4 hours, and \\(t\\) is 24 hours. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[N = 100 \\times 2^{(24/4)}\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponent:\n\n\\[24 \\div 4 = 6\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[N = 100 \\times 2^6\\]\n\nNow, \\(2^6\\) is 64. Therefore:\n\n\\[N = 100 \\times 64 = 6400\\]\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. Starting with 100 bacteria, doubling every 4 hours:\n\n- After 4 hours: 100 \u00d7 2 = 200\n\n- After 8 hours: 200 \u00d7 2 = 400\n\n- After 12 hours: 400 \u00d7 2 = 800\n\n- After 16 hours: 800 \u00d7 2 = 1600\n\n- After 20 hours: 1600 \u00d7 2 = 3200\n\n- After 24 hours: 3200 \u00d7 2 = 6400\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, after 24 hours, there should be 6,400 bacteria.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this differently. Perhaps using the formula for exponential growth with a continuous growth rate. The general formula is:\n\n\\[N = N_0 \\times e^{(kt)}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(k\\) is the growth rate.\n\nFirst, I need to find \\(k\\). I know that the population doubles every 4 hours, so:\n\n\\[2N_0 = N_0 \\times e^{(k \\times 4)}\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(N_0\\):\n\n\\[2 = e^{(4k)}\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\\ln(2) = 4k\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{4}\\]\n\nNow, plugging \\(k\\) back into the exponential growth formula for \\(t = 24\\) hours:\n\n\\[N = 100 \\times e^{(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{4} \\times 24)}\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponent:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\ln(2)}{4} \\times 24 = 6 \\ln(2) = \\ln(2^6) = \\ln(64)\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[N = 100 \\times e^{\\ln(64)} = 100 \\times 64 = 6400\\]\n\nAgain, I get 6,400. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the number of doubling periods in 24 hours. Since the population doubles every 4 hours, in 24 hours there are:\n\n\\[24 \\div 4 = 6\\]\n\nDoubling periods. So, starting with 100 bacteria, after 6 doublings:\n\n\\[N = 100 \\times 2^6 = 100 \\times 64 = 6400\\]\n\nSame result again. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if the doubling isn't discrete but continuous, but I already considered continuous growth and got the same answer. Or perhaps there are limitations to the growth, like resource constraints, but the problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so I assume unlimited growth.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The doubling time is in hours, and the total time is in hours, so that's fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the initial time is included as a doubling period. For example, at time \\(t = 0\\), the population is 100. Then after 4 hours, it doubles to 200, and so on. So, yes, the initial population is not counted as a doubling but as the starting point.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I make a table:\n\n- At \\(t = 0\\) hours: 100 bacteria\n\n- At \\(t = 4\\) hours: 200\n\n- At \\(t = 8\\) hours: 400\n\n- At \\(t = 12\\) hours: 800\n\n- At \\(t = 16\\) hours: 1,600\n\n- At \\(t = 20\\) hours: 3,200\n\n- At \\(t = 24\\) hours: 6,400\n\nLooks good.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to graph this, it would be an exponential curve starting at 100 and doubling every 4 hours up to 24 hours.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The answer should be 6,400 bacteria after 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6400} \\]"
