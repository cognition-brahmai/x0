        "content": "Let's tackle this percentage change problem step by step. So, we have a company whose revenue increased by 20% in the first quarter and then decreased by 10% in the second quarter. We need to find out what the net percentage change in revenue is over these two quarters.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand that percentage changes are not additive. That means we can't just add 20% and minus 10% to get a 10% increase overall. The order of changes and the base amounts matter.\n\nLet's assume the company's initial revenue is R.\n\nIn the first quarter, the revenue increases by 20%. So, the increase is 20% of R, which is 0.20R. Therefore, the revenue at the end of the first quarter is:\n\nR + 0.20R = 1.20R\n\nNow, in the second quarter, the revenue decreases by 10%. This 10% decrease is applied to the new revenue amount, which is 1.20R. So, the decrease is 10% of 1.20R, which is 0.10 * 1.20R = 0.12R.\n\nTherefore, the revenue at the end of the second quarter is:\n\n1.20R - 0.12R = 1.08R\n\nNow, to find the net percentage change over the two quarters, we compare the final revenue to the initial revenue.\n\nThe change in revenue is:\n\n1.08R - R = 0.08R\n\nTo find the percentage change, we divide the change by the initial revenue and multiply by 100:\n\n(0.08R / R) * 100 = 8%\n\nSo, the net percentage change in revenue over the two quarters is an 8% increase.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this to make sure it's accurate. Sometimes these percentage changes can be tricky.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the overall multiplicative factor.\n\nFirst quarter: 20% increase = multiply by 1.20\n\nSecond quarter: 10% decrease = multiply by 0.90\n\nSo, overall factor is 1.20 * 0.90 = 1.08\n\nAgain, this tells us that the final revenue is 1.08 times the initial revenue, which is an 8% increase.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider an example with actual numbers to verify.\n\nSuppose the initial revenue R is $100.\n\nFirst quarter: 20% increase = $100 + $20 = $120\n\nSecond quarter: 10% decrease of $120 = $120 - $12 = $108\n\nNet change from $100 to $108 is an $8 increase, which is 8% of the initial $100.\n\nYes, this confirms our calculation.\n\nSo, the net percentage change in revenue over the two quarters is 8%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\%} \\]"
