        "content": "So the farmer has 300 meters of fencing material and wants to fence off a rectangular area for his sheep, right? And he wants to maximize the enclosed area with that fencing. Okay, let's see how we can help him figure out the best dimensions for the rectangle.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all four sides. So, if the rectangle has a length of 'L' meters and a width of 'W' meters, the perimeter P would be:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nBut here, the farmer has 300 meters of fencing, which means the perimeter is 300 meters. So:\n\n2L + 2W = 300\n\nI can simplify that equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nL + W = 150\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, the area A of the rectangle is given by:\n\nA = L \u00d7 W\n\nThe farmer wants to maximize this area, given the perimeter constraint we just found.\n\nSo, I need to express the area in terms of one variable, either L or W, and then find the maximum possible area.\n\nLet's solve the perimeter equation for one variable, say W:\n\nW = 150 - L\n\nNow, plug this into the area formula:\n\nA = L \u00d7 (150 - L)\n\nSo,\n\nA = 150L - L\u00b2\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of L, and it's in the form:\n\nA = -L\u00b2 + 150L\n\nI know that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of L\u00b2 is negative, this parabola opens downwards, which means it has a maximum point. That maximum point will give us the maximum area.\n\nTo find the value of L that maximizes the area, I can use the vertex formula for a parabola, which is:\n\nL = -b / (2a)\n\nIn this equation, a = -1 (coefficient of L\u00b2) and b = 150 (coefficient of L).\n\nSo,\n\nL = -150 / (2 \u00d7 -1) = 150 / 2 = 75 meters\n\nNow that I have L, I can find W using the earlier equation:\n\nW = 150 - L = 150 - 75 = 75 meters\n\nWait a minute, so both L and W are 75 meters? That means the rectangle is actually a square.\n\nIs that possible? I thought a rectangle can have different length and width. But according to this calculation, the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose I choose different values for L and see what happens to the area.\n\nFor example, if L = 70 meters, then W = 150 - 70 = 80 meters.\n\nSo, area A = 70 \u00d7 80 = 5600 square meters.\n\nIf L = 75 meters, W = 75 meters, A = 75 \u00d7 75 = 5625 square meters.\n\nAnd if L = 80 meters, W = 70 meters, A = 80 \u00d7 70 = 5600 square meters again.\n\nSo, indeed, the area is larger when L = W = 75 meters.\n\nLet me try another pair:\n\nL = 60 meters, W = 90 meters, A = 60 \u00d7 90 = 5400 square meters.\n\nStill less than 5625.\n\nAnd if L = 50 meters, W = 100 meters, A = 50 \u00d7 100 = 5000 square meters.\n\nEven smaller.\n\nSo, it seems that the maximum area is indeed achieved when the rectangle is a square with sides of 75 meters.\n\nBut why is that? Is there a general principle here?\n\nI recall that for a given perimeter, the shape that encloses the maximum area is a circle. But here, we're dealing with a rectangle, so among all possible rectangles with a given perimeter, the square has the maximum area.\n\nIs there a way to prove this?\n\nWell, in calculus, we learn about optimization problems, and this is a classic example.\n\nBut since the farmer might not be familiar with calculus, is there another way to explain it?\n\nLet's see.\n\nWe have the area A = 150L - L\u00b2.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and its graph is a parabola that opens downwards because of the negative coefficient of L\u00b2.\n\nThe maximum value of A occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at L = 75 meters, as we calculated.\n\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for the quadratic equation to find the maximum area.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStarting with A = 150L - L\u00b2.\n\nRewrite it as A = - (L\u00b2 - 150L)\n\nNow, complete the square inside the parentheses.\n\nTake half of the coefficient of L, which is 75, and square it: 75\u00b2 = 5625.\n\nSo,\n\nA = - (L\u00b2 - 150L + 5625 - 5625)\n\n= - ( (L - 75)\u00b2 - 5625 )\n\n= - (L - 75)\u00b2 + 5625\n\nSo, the maximum area is 5625 square meters, occurring when L = 75 meters.\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, to ensure there are no other possibilities, let's consider if there's a way to get a larger area with the same perimeter.\n\nSuppose the farmer decides to make the rectangle longer and narrower, say L = 100 meters, then W = 50 meters, A = 5000 square meters, which is less than 5625.\n\nOr, if L = 60 meters, W = 90 meters, A = 5400 square meters, still less.\n\nAlternatively, if L = 75 meters, W = 75 meters, A = 5625 square meters.\n\nIt seems consistent that the square gives the maximum area.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's a rectangular shape that could give a larger area.\n\nSuppose the farmer considers making the rectangle a bit longer than wide, say L = 76 meters, then W = 74 meters.\n\nA = 76 \u00d7 74 = 5624 square meters, which is slightly less than 5625.\n\nOr L = 75.5 meters, W = 74.5 meters.\n\nA = 75.5 \u00d7 74.5 = 5624.75 square meters, still less than 5625.\n\nSo, it seems that any deviation from the square dimensions results in a smaller area.\n\nTherefore, the farmer should make the rectangle a square with sides of 75 meters to maximize the enclosed area with 300 meters of fencing.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nWe had:\n\nPerimeter P = 2L + 2W = 300 meters.\n\nSimplified to L + W = 150 meters.\n\nExpressed W in terms of L: W = 150 - L.\n\nThen, area A = L \u00d7 W = L \u00d7 (150 - L) = 150L - L\u00b2.\n\nFound the maximum area by finding the vertex of the parabola: L = 75 meters.\n\nThen, W = 150 - 75 = 75 meters.\n\nArea A = 75 \u00d7 75 = 5625 square meters.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the farmer insists on having a rectangle that's not a square, he would end up with a smaller area.\n\nFor example, if he wants a longer rectangle, say L = 80 meters, then W = 70 meters, area A = 5600 square meters.\n\nThat's 25 square meters less than the maximum.\n\nOr, if he goes for a\u66f4\u7a84\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982L=90\u7c73\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48W=60\u7c73\uff0c\u9762\u79efA=5400\u5e73\u65b9\u7c73\uff0c\u5c11\u4e86225\u5e73\u65b9\u7c73\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4ece\u9762\u79ef\u6700\u5927\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u662f\u6700\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\uff0c\u573a\u5730\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ea\u80fd\u505a\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u5bbd\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u7f8a\u7fa4\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4ece\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\u3002\n\n\u518d\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u505a\u6210\u5176\u4ed6\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u83f1\u5f62\u6216\u8005\u68af\u5f62\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u7b49\u5468\u5b9a\u7406\uff08isoperimetric inequality\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5468\u957f\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5706\u5f62\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u6700\u5927\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u519c\u6c11\u8981\u56f4\u6210\u77e9\u5f62\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u662f\u9762\u79ef\u6700\u5927\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u77e9\u5f62\uff0c\u5f53\u957f\u548c\u5bbd\u76f8\u7b49\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u6700\u5927\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7b97\u672f\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08AM-GM inequality\uff09\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636eAM-GM\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u975e\u8d1f\u5b9e\u6570a\u548cb\uff0c\u6709\uff1a\n\n(a + b)/2 \u2265 \u221a(a*b)\n\n\u7b49\u53f7\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53a = b\u65f6\u6210\u7acb\u3002\n\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0ca\u548cb\u5206\u522b\u662f\u957f\u5ea6L\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6W\uff0c\u4e14L + W = 150\u7c73\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c(L + W)/2 \u2265 \u221a(L*W)\n\n\u5373\uff0c150/2 \u2265 \u221aA\n\n75 \u2265 \u221aA\n\n\u4e24\u8fb9\u5e73\u65b9\uff0c\u5f97\u5230 A \u2264 5625\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u9762\u79efA\u6700\u5927\u4e3a5625\u5e73\u65b9\u7c73\uff0c\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53L = W = 75\u7c73\u65f6\u53d6\u7b49\u53f7\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u518d\u6b21\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u519c\u6c11\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06\u7f8a\u5708\u56f4\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fb9\u957f\u4e3a75\u7c73\u7684\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316 enclosed area\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75 \\text{ meters by } 75 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
