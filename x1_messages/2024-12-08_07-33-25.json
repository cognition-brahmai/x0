        "content": "Let's see. So, the store has a product that costs $100 each, and if you buy 3 or more, you get a 10% discount. The customer is buying 4 items, and I need to find out how much they save compared to buying them at full price.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what the total cost would be without any discount. Since each item is $100 and they're buying 4, that should be straightforward.\n\nTotal cost without discount = number of items \u00d7 price per item\nSo, 4 \u00d7 $100 = $400.\n\nNow, since they're buying 3 or more items, they get a 10% discount. So, I need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract that from the total cost without discount to find out what they actually pay.\n\nFirst, find the discount amount:\nDiscount = total cost without discount \u00d7 discount rate\nThat is, $400 \u00d7 10% = $400 \u00d7 0.10 = $40.\n\nSo, the total cost with discount is:\nTotal cost with discount = total cost without discount - discount\n$400 - $40 = $360.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much they save compared to buying at full price. Well, the savings would be the discount amount, which is $40.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. They're buying 4 items, which qualifies for the discount. The discount is 10% on the total purchase, so $400 minus $40 equals $360, which is what they pay. So, the savings are indeed $40.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it per item. Each item is discounted by 10%, so each item is $100 - ($100 \u00d7 10%) = $100 - $10 = $90 per item. Then, for 4 items, it would be 4 \u00d7 $90 = $360, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the savings are $40.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe considering the price per item with discount and without discount.\n\nWithout discount, each item is $100.\n\nWith discount, each item is $90.\n\nSo, per item, the savings are $100 - $90 = $10.\n\nFor 4 items, total savings would be 4 \u00d7 $10 = $40.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think $40 is the correct savings.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other discount or if there's a mistake in the interpretation.\n\nThe discount is clearly stated as 10% on purchases of 3 or more items. Since 4 is more than 3, the discount applies to the entire purchase.\n\nThere's no mention of any other discounts or conditions, so I think $40 is the correct amount saved.\n\nAlternatively, if the discount was per item instead of on the total purchase, but according to the statement, it's a 10% discount on purchases of 3 or more items, which typically means a 10% discount on the total purchase price.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, calculating it per item gives the same total savings, so it doesn't matter in this case.\n\nSo, the final answer is $40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
