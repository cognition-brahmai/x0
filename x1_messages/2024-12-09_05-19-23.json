        "content": "Implementing a simple chat application using Python's socket library involves creating both a server and a client program. The server will handle multiple clients simultaneously, allowing them to send and receive messages to and from each other. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Server\n\nThe server will need to handle multiple clients simultaneously. To achieve this, we can use threading in Python. Each client will be handled in a separate thread.\n\n#### Server Code\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport threading\n\n# Server configuration\nHOST = '127.0.0.1'  # Server's IP address\nPORT = 65432        # Port to listen on\n\n# List to keep track of connected clients\nclients = []\n\ndef handle_client(conn, addr):\n    global clients\n    print(f\"New connection from {addr}\")\n    clients.append(conn)\n    try:\n        while True:\n            data = conn.recv(1024)\n            if not data:\n                break\n            message = data.decode('utf-8')\n            print(f\"Received from {addr}: {message}\")\n            # Send the message to all other clients\n            for client in clients:\n                if client != conn:\n                    client.sendall(data)\n    finally:\n        clients.remove(conn)\n        conn.close()\n\ndef start_server():\n    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:\n        s.bind((HOST, PORT))\n        s.listen()\n        print(f\"Server listening on {HOST}:{PORT}\")\n        while True:\n            conn, addr = s.accept()\n            thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(conn, addr))\n            thread.start()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_server()\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Client\n\nThe client will connect to the server and be able to send and receive messages.\n\n#### Client Code\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport threading\n\n# Server configuration\nHOST = '127.0.0.1'  # Server's IP address\nPORT = 65432        # Port to connect to\n\ndef receive_messages(sock):\n    try:\n        while True:\n            data = sock.recv(1024)\n            if not data:\n                break\n            print(data.decode('utf-8'))\n    finally:\n        sock.close()\n\ndef start_client():\n    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:\n        s.connect((HOST, PORT))\n        print(f\"Connected to {HOST}:{PORT}\")\n        # Start a thread to receive messages\n        receive_thread = threading.Thread(target=receive_messages, args=(s,))\n        receive_thread.start()\n        # Send messages\n        try:\n            while True:\n                message = input()\n                s.sendall(message.encode('utf-8'))\n        except KeyboardInterrupt:\n            print(\"Closing connection.\")\n            s.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_client()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - The server binds to a specific host and port and listens for incoming connections.\n   - When a client connects, a new thread is started to handle that client's communications.\n   - Each client is added to a list of connected clients.\n   - Messages received from a client are broadcast to all other connected clients.\n\n2. **Client Setup:**\n   - The client connects to the server's host and port.\n   - A separate thread is started to handle receiving messages from the server.\n   - The main thread handles sending messages to the server.\n\nThis setup allows multiple clients to connect to the server and communicate with each other through the server. Each client can send messages that are then broadcast to all other connected clients."
