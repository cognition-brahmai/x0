        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: there's a box with 4 apples, 3 oranges, and 2 bananas. I need to find the probability that if I pick two fruits at random without replacement, both of them are apples. Okay, probability problems can be a bit tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in the box. There are 4 apples, 3 oranges, and 2 bananas. So, the total number of fruits is 4 + 3 + 2, which equals 9 fruits.\n\nNow, I'm picking two fruits without replacement. That means once I pick the first fruit, it doesn't go back into the box, so the total number of fruits decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nI need to find the probability that both fruits are apples. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, for the first pick, the probability of picking an apple is the number of apples divided by the total number of fruits, which is 4 apples out of 9 fruits. So, that's 4/9.\n\nAfter I've picked the first apple, I don't replace it, so now there are 3 apples left and a total of 8 fruits remaining in the box.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another apple on the second pick is 3/8.\n\nSince these are sequential events without replacement, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening given that the previous event has occurred.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both fruits are apples is (4/9) multiplied by (3/8).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(4/9) * (3/8) = (4*3) / (9*8) = 12 / 72.\n\nSimplifying 12/72, I divide both numerator and denominator by 12, which gives me 1/6.\n\nSo, the probability that both fruits are apples is 1/6.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use combinations. Since the order in which I pick the fruits doesn't matter (I just need both to be apples), I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 apples out of 4 is given by the combination formula C(4,2), which is 4! / (2! * (4-2)! ) = (4*3*2*1) / (2*1 * 2*1) = 6.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 2 fruits out of 9 is C(9,2), which is 9! / (2! * (9-2)! ) = (9*8*7!) / (2*1 * 7!) = (9*8) / 2 = 36.\n\nSo, the probability that both fruits are apples is the number of ways to choose 2 apples divided by the total number of ways to choose any 2 fruits, which is 6 / 36 = 1/6.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is indeed 1/6.\n\nLet me see if there's yet another way to verify this. Maybe I can think about it in terms of probabilities without using combinations.\n\nThe probability that the first fruit is an apple is 4/9, as I calculated before. Then, given that the first fruit is an apple, the probability that the second fruit is also an apple is 3/8, since there are now 3 apples left out of 8 fruits.\n\nMultiplying these probabilities gives (4/9)*(3/8) = 12/72 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability that the first fruit is not an apple and the second one is, but that's not relevant here since I need both to be apples.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since I'm only interested in both being apples, I don't need to consider other scenarios.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that I might have missed. For example, the order of picking the fruits. But since I'm dealing with combinations, the order doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider permutations, I would have to adjust accordingly, but using combinations seems more straightforward in this case.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about the hypergeometric distribution, which deals with sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = [C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (total fruits: 9)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (apples: 4)\n\n- n is the number of draws (2)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 apples)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X=2) = [C(4,2) * C(9-4, 2-2)] / C(9,2) = [6 * C(5,0)] / 36 = (6 * 1) / 36 = 6/36 = 1/6\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently that the probability is 1/6.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach.\n\nSuppose I list all possible pairs of fruits and count how many of them are both apples.\n\nTotal possible pairs: 9 choose 2, which is 36.\n\nNumber of pairs where both are apples: 4 choose 2, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, probability = 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI can also think about it as the probability of picking one apple and then another apple without replacement.\n\nFirst apple: 4/9\n\nSecond apple: 3/8\n\nMultiply: 4/9 * 3/8 = 12/72 = 1/6\n\nConsistent again.\n\nI think it's clear that the probability is 1/6.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the decimal equivalent.\n\n1/6 is approximately 0.1667, or about 16.67%.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nWell, there are 9 fruits, and I'm picking 2. The chance that both are apples, given there are 4 apples, should be somewhat low, since apples make up less than half of the fruits.\n\nSpecifically, with 4 apples out of 9, the probability of picking two apples in a row without replacement is indeed around 16.67%.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it, the probability of picking an apple first is 4/9 \u2248 0.4444, and then picking another apple is 3/8 = 0.375.\n\nMultiplying them gives approximately 0.1667, which matches 1/6.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in every way I can think of. The probability is definitely 1/6.\n\nJust to summarize, the key points are:\n\n- Total fruits: 9\n\n- Apples: 4\n\n- Picking 2 fruits without replacement\n\n- Probability both are apples: C(4,2) / C(9,2) = 6/36 = 1/6\n\nAlternatively: (4/9)*(3/8) = 12/72 = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
