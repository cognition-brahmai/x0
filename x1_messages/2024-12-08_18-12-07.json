        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There's a room full of people, and they're divided into two groups: those wearing glasses and those not wearing glasses. According to the problem, 40% of the people are wearing glasses, and 60% are not. Then, among those wearing glasses, 30% have brown hair, and among those not wearing glasses, 20% have brown hair. I need to find out what percentage of the entire room has brown hair.\n\nOkay, first things first. I think I should start by understanding the groups here. Let's assume there are 100 people in the room to make the percentages easier to work with. So, if there are 100 people:\n\n- 40% are wearing glasses, which is 40 people.\n\n- 60% are not wearing glasses, which is 60 people.\n\nNow, of these 40 people wearing glasses, 30% have brown hair. So, 30% of 40 is:\n\n0.30 * 40 = 12 people\n\nSimilarly, of the 60 people not wearing glasses, 20% have brown hair. So, 20% of 60 is:\n\n0.20 * 60 = 12 people\n\nNow, to find the total number of people with brown hair, I just need to add these two numbers together:\n\n12 (from the glasses wearers) + 12 (from the non-glasses wearers) = 24 people\n\nSince there are 100 people in total, the percentage of people with brown hair is:\n\n(24 / 100) * 100% = 24%\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nLet me try using fractions or maybe probabilities. Let's think in terms of probabilities.\n\nThe probability that a person wears glasses is 40%, or 0.4.\n\nThe probability that a person does not wear glasses is 60%, or 0.6.\n\nGiven that a person wears glasses, the probability that they have brown hair is 30%, or 0.3.\n\nGiven that a person does not wear glasses, the probability that they have brown hair is 20%, or 0.2.\n\nI need to find the total probability that a person has brown hair, regardless of whether they wear glasses or not.\n\nThis sounds like a job for the law of total probability. The law of total probability states that the total probability of an event can be found by summing the probabilities of the event occurring given each possible scenario, weighted by the probability of each scenario.\n\nSo, in formula terms:\n\nP(Brown Hair) = P(Brown Hair | Wears Glasses) * P(Wears Glasses) + P(Brown Hair | Does not wear Glasses) * P(Does not wear Glasses)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(Brown Hair) = (0.3 * 0.4) + (0.2 * 0.6)\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12\n\n0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n0.12 + 0.12 = 0.24\n\nWhich is 24%.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that gives me more confidence.\n\nBut let's think about it another way to be absolutely sure. Suppose I draw a tree diagram.\n\nFirst branch: Wears glasses (40%) and does not wear glasses (60%).\n\nThen, for each branch, another branch for having brown hair and not having brown hair.\n\nFor the wears glasses branch:\n\n- Brown hair: 30% of 40% = 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 or 12%\n\n- Not brown hair: 70% of 40% = 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28 or 28%\n\nFor the does not wear glasses branch:\n\n- Brown hair: 20% of 60% = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12 or 12%\n\n- Not brown hair: 80% of 60% = 0.8 * 0.6 = 0.48 or 48%\n\nNow, to find the total percentage with brown hair, I add the brown hair branches:\n\n12% (from glasses wearers) + 12% (from non-glasses wearers) = 24%\n\nAgain, the same answer. This is consistent across different methods, so I think it's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or if there's any other factor I'm missing. For example, is it possible that some people have both glasses and brown hair, or neither? Well, the way the problem is stated, it seems like the categories are independent: wearing glasses doesn't affect having brown hair directly, except for the given percentages.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any other characteristics that could influence the hair color, so I think it's safe to assume that these are the only factors we need to consider.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the entire population and apply the given percentages step by step.\n\nLet\u2019s say there are 100 people:\n\n- 40 wear glasses.\n\n- Of these 40, 30% have brown hair: 0.3 * 40 = 12.\n\n- 60 do not wear glasses.\n\n- Of these 60, 20% have brown hair: 0.2 * 60 = 12.\n\n- Total with brown hair: 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n- Percentage: (24 / 100) * 100% = 24%.\n\nIt's the same answer again. I think I\u2019ve confirmed it sufficiently through multiple methods: the direct percentage calculation, the law of total probability, and the tree diagram approach. All of these independently lead me to the same conclusion that 24% of the people in the room have brown hair.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I\u2019ll consider if there\u2019s any possibility of misinterpretation in the problem statement. The problem says \"40% are wearing glasses, and 60% are not.\" That seems clear. Then, \"of those wearing glasses, 30% have brown hair,\" and \"of those not wearing glasses, 20% have brown hair.\" Again, that seems straightforward. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any ambiguity in the wording.\n\nMoreover, the problem doesn't specify anything about the room's size, so using 100 people as a reference is a common and convenient approach for percentage calculations. If the room had a different number of people, the percentages would scale accordingly, but the final percentage of people with brown hair would remain the same.\n\nI can also consider if there's a way to express this in algebraic terms. Let\u2019s denote the total number of people as N.\n\nThen:\n\n- Number wearing glasses: 0.4N\n\n- Number not wearing glasses: 0.6N\n\n- Number with brown hair wearing glasses: 0.3 * 0.4N = 0.12N\n\n- Number with brown hair not wearing glasses: 0.2 * 0.6N = 0.12N\n\n- Total with brown hair: 0.12N + 0.12N = 0.24N\n\n- Percentage: (0.24N / N) * 100% = 24%\n\nAgain, the same result. This algebraic approach confirms the numerical calculations I did earlier.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from several angles and consistently arrived at 24% as the answer. Unless there's some hidden factor or conditional probability that I'm missing, which doesn't seem to be the case based on the problem statement, I'm confident that 24% is the correct percentage of people in the room who have brown hair.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24\\%} \\]"
