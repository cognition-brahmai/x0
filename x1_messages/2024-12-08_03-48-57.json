        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a group of people working on a project that takes 30 days to complete if everyone works together. But if one person leaves, it takes the remaining members an additional 5 days to finish, making it 35 days in total. We need to find out how many people were in the group initially.\n\nFirst, I think we need to figure out the relationship between the number of people and the time taken to complete the project. Generally, more people mean the project gets done faster, and fewer people mean it takes longer. Specifically, in this case, losing one person increases the time by 5 days.\n\nLet's denote the initial number of people in the group as \\( n \\).\n\nNext, we need to think about the work done. Work is usually considered as the product of the number of people, the number of days they work, and their individual work rates. But to simplify, we can assume that each person works at the same rate.\n\nLet's assume that each person works at a constant rate of \\( r \\) units of work per day. Then, the total work required to complete the project is the number of people times the number of days times their work rate.\n\nSo, total work \\( w \\) when all \\( n \\) people work together for 30 days is:\n\n\\[ w = n \\times 30 \\times r \\]\n\nNow, if one person leaves, there are \\( n - 1 \\) people left, and it takes them 35 days to complete the same work:\n\n\\[ w = (n - 1) \\times 35 \\times r \\]\n\nSince both expressions equal the total work \\( w \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\[ n \\times 30 \\times r = (n - 1) \\times 35 \\times r \\]\n\nWe can cancel out \\( r \\) from both sides since it's a common factor and assuming \\( r \\neq 0 \\):\n\n\\[ n \\times 30 = (n - 1) \\times 35 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( n \\):\n\nFirst, expand the right side:\n\n\\[ 30n = 35(n - 1) \\]\n\n\\[ 30n = 35n - 35 \\]\n\nNow, bring like terms together:\n\n\\[ 30n - 35n = -35 \\]\n\n\\[ -5n = -35 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-35}{-5} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 7 \\]\n\nSo, there were initially 7 people in the group.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal work with all members:\n\n\\[ w = n \\times 30 \\times r \\]\n\nTotal work with one member less:\n\n\\[ w = (n - 1) \\times 35 \\times r \\]\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n\\[ n \\times 30 \\times r = (n - 1) \\times 35 \\times r \\]\n\nCancel \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ 30n = 35(n - 1) \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ 30n = 35n - 35 \\]\n\nSubtract 35n from both sides:\n\n\\[ 30n - 35n = -35 \\]\n\n\\[ -5n = -35 \\]\n\nDivide by -5:\n\n\\[ n = 7 \\]\n\nSeems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to think in terms of work rates. The combined work rate of the group is such that they complete the project in 30 days. So, the combined work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\) of the project per day.\n\nIf one person leaves, the combined work rate drops to \\( \\frac{1}{35} \\) of the project per day.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the work rate of one person as \\( r \\). Then, the total work rate of \\( n \\) people is \\( n \\times r \\), which equals \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\):\n\n\\[ n \\times r = \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\nWith one person less, the work rate is \\( (n - 1) \\times r = \\frac{1}{35} \\):\n\n\\[ (n - 1) \\times r = \\frac{1}{35} \\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( n r = \\frac{1}{30} \\)\n\n2. \\( (n - 1) r = \\frac{1}{35} \\)\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. Let\u2019s solve the first equation for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{1}{30n} \\]\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ (n - 1) \\times \\frac{1}{30n} = \\frac{1}{35} \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n - 1}{30n} = \\frac{1}{35} \\]\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n\\[ 35(n - 1) = 30n \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ 35n - 35 = 30n \\]\n\nSubtract 30n from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5n - 35 = 0 \\]\n\nAdd 35 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 5n = 35 \\]\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\[ n = 7 \\]\n\nAgain, we get \\( n = 7 \\). This matches our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the work rates in terms of fractions. The difference in work rates between the full team and the team minus one person is equal to the work rate of one person.\n\nSo, the work rate of one person is:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{1}{30} - \\frac{1}{35} \\]\n\nLet\u2019s calculate that:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for 30 and 35, which is 210.\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{7}{210} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{35} = \\frac{6}{210} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{7}{210} - \\frac{6}{210} = \\frac{1}{210} \\]\n\nThis means one person's work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{210} \\) of the project per day.\n\nNow, since the full team completes the project in 30 days, their combined work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\) per day.\n\nIf one person's work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{210} \\), then the number of people \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[ n \\times \\frac{1}{210} = \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{1}{30} \\times 210 = 7 \\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nLet\u2019s try another approach to confirm. Suppose we think about the total amount of work in person-days.\n\nIf \\( n \\) people can complete the project in 30 days, the total work is \\( 30n \\) person-days.\n\nIf one person leaves, \\( n - 1 \\) people take 35 days to complete the same work, so the total work is \\( 35(n - 1) \\) person-days.\n\nSince the total work is the same, we can set them equal:\n\n\\[ 30n = 35(n - 1) \\]\n\nThis is the same equation we had earlier, which gives \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the concept of work done per day.\n\nThe full team does \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\) of the work per day.\n\nThe team minus one person does \\( \\frac{1}{35} \\) of the work per day.\n\nThe difference between these is the work rate of the one person who left:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{30} - \\frac{1}{35} = \\text{work rate of one person} \\]\n\nWe already calculated this as \\( \\frac{1}{210} \\), meaning one person does \\( \\frac{1}{210} \\) of the work per day.\n\nNow, the full team's work rate is \\( n \\) times the individual work rate:\n\n\\[ n \\times \\frac{1}{210} = \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{1}{30} \\times 210 = 7 \\]\n\nConsistently, we get \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nPerhaps we can try another method, like assuming specific values or using ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the ratio of the times taken with \\( n \\) people and with \\( n - 1 \\) people.\n\nThe time ratio is \\( 30 : 35 \\), which simplifies to \\( 6 : 7 \\).\n\nIn general, for a fixed amount of work, time is inversely proportional to the number of people.\n\nSo, if time increases by a factor of \\( \\frac{7}{6} \\) when one person leaves, then the number of people must decrease in such a way that the product of the number of people and the time remains constant (since work is constant).\n\nMathematically, \\( n \\times 30 = (n - 1) \\times 35 \\), which is the same equation we started with.\n\nAlternatively, since time increases by 5 days when one person leaves, we can think about how much work is done per day and how the reduction in workforce affects the completion time.\n\nBut I think we've confirmed sufficiently through multiple approaches that the initial number of people in the group is 7.\n\nTo ensure there are no calculation errors, let's verify the arithmetic again.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ 30n = 35(n - 1) \\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[ 30n = 35n - 35 \\]\n\nSubtract 35n from both sides:\n\n\\[ -5n = -35 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\n\\[ n = 7 \\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the initial number of people in the group is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
