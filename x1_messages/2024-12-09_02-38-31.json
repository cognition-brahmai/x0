        "content": "In actuarial science, the method used to estimate the future value of an annuity when the payments are made at the beginning of each period is called the \"Annuity Due Method.\" So, the correct answer is C. Annuity due method.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, an annuity due involves payments made at the beginning of each period, as opposed to an ordinary annuity, where payments are made at the end of each period. Because the payments in an annuity due are made earlier, they earn interest for an additional period. This means that the future value of an annuity due will be higher than that of an ordinary annuity with the same payment amount and interest rate.\n\nThe formula to calculate the future value of an annuity due is:\n\nFV = P * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ] * (1 + r)\n\nWhere:\n\n- FV is the future value of the annuity due\n\n- P is the amount of each payment\n\n- r is the interest rate per period\n\n- n is the number of periods\n\nThis formula takes into account the extra period of compounding for each payment since they are made at the beginning of each period.\n\nSo, in summary, when dealing with annuities where payments are made at the beginning of each period, the annuity due method is the appropriate approach to estimate their future value.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Actuarial Mathematics for Life Contingent Risks by David C.
