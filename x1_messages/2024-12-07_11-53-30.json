        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. The gardener wants to plant flowers along the perimeter, spacing them every 2 feet. I need to figure out how many flowers are needed for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is. I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, it's calculated by adding up all the sides. So, since there are two lengths and two widths, the formula should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the perimeter is 70 feet. Now, the gardener wants to plant flowers every 2 feet along this perimeter. To find out how many flowers are needed, I think I can divide the perimeter by the spacing between the flowers.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of flowers} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter}}{\\text{Spacing}} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard that when planting things around a closed shape, you might need to consider that the first and last flower would be the same, so you might not need to count one of them. Is that the case here?\n\nLet me think about it. If I imagine starting at one corner and planting flowers every 2 feet all the way around the garden, when I get back to the starting point, the last flower would be right next to the first one, essentially overlapping. So, maybe I should subtract one flower from the total.\n\nSo, the number of flowers would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of flowers} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter}}{\\text{Spacing}} - 1 = 35 - 1 = 34\n\\]\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure about this. Maybe I should visualize it or try a smaller example to see.\n\nSuppose the garden is a smaller rectangle, say 4 feet by 3 feet. The perimeter would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (4 + 3) = 14 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nIf I plant flowers every 2 feet, following the same logic:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of flowers} = \\frac{14}{2} - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, let's see if that makes sense. Let's map it out.\n\nStarting at the bottom left corner (point A), plant a flower.\n\nMove 2 feet to the right (point B), plant another flower.\n\nContinue to the end of the length (2 feet steps): point C at 4 feet.\n\nThen, turn up to the top right corner (point D), planting every 2 feet.\n\nContinue along the top to the left side.\n\nTurn down, planting every 2 feet.\n\nFinally, return to the starting point.\n\nWait, in this 4x3 rectangle, the perimeter is 14 feet. Dividing by 2 gives 7, but do I need 7 flowers or 6?\n\nLet me count manually:\n\n1. Start at bottom left, flower #1.\n\n2. Move 2 feet to the right, flower #2.\n\n3. Move another 2 feet to the right, flower #3.\n\n4. Turn up and move 2 feet, flower #4.\n\n5. Move another 2 feet up, but the top length is only 3 feet, so moving 2 feet up would reach the top right corner, flower #5.\n\n6. Move left along the top, 2 feet to flower #6.\n\n7. Move down, 2 feet to flower #7, which would be at the starting point again.\n\nWait, but in reality, the starting point is already occupied by flower #1, so does that mean flower #7 is overlapping with flower #1?\n\nIf that's the case, maybe I don't need that seventh flower. So, total flowers needed would be 6, not 7.\n\nWait, but in this smaller example, perimeter/spacing -1 gives 6, which seems to match my manual count.\n\nBut in the original problem, using the same formula, perimeter is 70 feet, spacing is 2 feet, so 70/2 -1 = 35 -1 = 34 flowers.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that the first flower is counted separately, and then the rest are spaced every 2 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is simply perimeter divided by spacing, without subtracting one, because the last flower naturally fits into place without overlapping.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I should think in terms of the number of intervals between flowers.\n\nIf I have n flowers, there are n intervals between them, each of 2 feet.\n\nSo, the total perimeter would be n \u00d7 2 feet.\n\nBut the perimeter is 70 feet, so:\n\n\\[\nn \\times 2 = 70 \\implies n = 35\n\\]\n\nBut earlier, in the smaller example, this would suggest 7 flowers, whereas my manual count said 6.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when planting around a closed loop, the number of intervals is equal to the number of flowers, meaning:\n\n\\[\n\\text{perimeter} = n \\times \\text{spacing}\n\\]\n\nSo, again, n = 70 / 2 = 35.\n\nBut in my smaller example, this doesn't match the manual count.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the smaller example.\n\nLet me recount for the smaller 4x3 rectangle.\n\nPerimeter is 14 feet, spacing is 2 feet.\n\nIf I plant flowers every 2 feet around the perimeter, starting at point A.\n\nPoint A: flower #1.\n\nMove 2 feet to point B: flower #2.\n\nContinue:\n\nPoint C: flower #3.\n\nPoint D: flower #4.\n\nPoint E: flower #5.\n\nPoint F: flower #6.\n\nPoint G: flower #7, which coincides with point A.\n\nWait, in this case, the seventh flower is at the same spot as the first flower. So, do I need both? Or does the last flower overlap the first one, meaning I don't need to count the last one separately?\n\nIf that's the case, then I would need 7 flowers in total, even though the last one overlaps the first.\n\nBut in my initial manual count, I thought only 6 were needed, but maybe I was wrong.\n\nLet me try plotting this out.\n\nAssume the garden is as follows:\n\nBottom side: 4 feet.\n\nStarting at bottom left (A), plant flower #1.\n\nMove 2 feet to the right (B), plant flower #2.\n\nAnother 2 feet to the right (C), plant flower #3.\n\nNow, turn up to the top right corner (D), which is 3 feet up.\n\nPlant flower #4 at point D.\n\nMove down to the top left corner (E), which is 4 feet left.\n\nPlant flower #5 at point E.\n\nMove down to the bottom left (F), which is 3 feet down.\n\nPlant flower #6 at point F, which is the same as point A.\n\nWait, but point F is the same as point A.\n\nSo, do I need a seventh flower? Or does the sixth flower coincide with the first one?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the movements.\n\nLet's try to be more precise.\n\nStarting at point A (bottom left), flower #1.\n\nMove 2 feet to the right to point B, flower #2.\n\nAnother 2 feet to the right to point C (bottom right), flower #3.\n\nNow, turn up and move 2 feet up to point D, flower #4.\n\nAnother 2 feet up would be beyond the top right corner, but the top length is only 3 feet, so from point D, moving 2 feet left to point E (top left), flower #5.\n\nFrom point E, move down 2 feet to point F, flower #6.\n\nFrom point F, move 2 feet to the right to point A, which is already occupied by flower #1.\n\nSo, in this case, to complete the loop, I would need to plant flower #7 at point A, overlapping with flower #1.\n\nTherefore, I need 7 flowers in total for the smaller example.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 6, but now it seems to be 7.\n\nSo, perimeter is 14 feet, spacing is 2 feet, number of flowers is 14 / 2 = 7.\n\nThis matches.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, with a perimeter of 70 feet and spacing of 2 feet, the number of flowers needed should be 70 / 2 = 35.\n\nEarlier confusion came from mistakenly thinking that the last flower overlaps the first one, so it shouldn't be counted separately, but in reality, you do need that last flower to complete the loop.\n\nHence, the answer should be 35 flowers.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider another example.\n\nSuppose the garden is a square with sides of 2 feet.\n\nPerimeter is 8 feet.\n\nPlanting flowers every 2 feet.\n\nAccording to the formula, 8 / 2 = 4 flowers.\n\nManually:\n\nStart at point A, flower #1.\n\nMove 2 feet to point B, flower #2.\n\nMove 2 feet to point C, flower #3.\n\nMove 2 feet to point D, flower #4.\n\nMove 2 feet back to point A, which is already flower #1.\n\nSo, total flowers needed are 4, which matches the calculation.\n\nAnother example: perimeter of 10 feet, spacing of 2 feet.\n\nNumber of flowers: 10 / 2 = 5.\n\nManually:\n\nStart at point A, flower #1.\n\nMove 2 feet to point B, flower #2.\n\nMove 2 feet to point C, flower #3.\n\nMove 2 feet to point D, flower #4.\n\nMove 2 feet to point E, flower #5.\n\nMove 2 feet back to point A, which is already flower #1.\n\nThus, 5 flowers in total.\n\nTherefore, the general rule is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of flowers} = \\frac{\\text{perimeter}}{\\text{spacing}}\n\\]\n\nProvided that the spacing is a factor of the perimeter.\n\nIn this problem, perimeter is 70 feet, spacing is 2 feet, so number of flowers is 35.\n\nHence, the gardener will need 35 flowers to plant along the perimeter of the garden with each flower spaced every 2 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
