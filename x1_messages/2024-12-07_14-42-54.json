Dinner's going to have to wait a little longer than planned.\n\nDon't worry; I've got it under control. Maybe while I'm at it, I can tweak a few things to make it even more efficient. Who knows, maybe I'll invent something revolutionary in the meantime.\n\nI promise I'll make it up to you. Maybe we can have dessert first when I get there? Your chocolate souffl\u00e9 is still the best part of the meal, in my opinion.\n\nSee you soon, gorgeous.\n\nTony Stark"
