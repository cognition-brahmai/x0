        "content": "Here's a simple Python script that reads a CSV file containing names and email addresses, sorts the data by last name in alphabetical order, and then prints it out. This script assumes that the CSV file has columns named 'Name' and 'Email', and that the names are in the format \"First Last\".\n\nFirst, make sure you have a CSV file prepared. For example, let's assume the CSV file is named `contacts.csv` and contains data like this:\n\n```\nName,Email\nJohn Doe,john.doe@example.com\nJane Smith,jane.smith@example.com\nAlice Johnson,alice.johnson@example.com\n```\n\nNow, here's the Python script:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef main():\n    # Path to your CSV file\n    file_path = 'contacts.csv'\n    \n    # List to hold the data\n    data = []\n    \n    # Read the CSV file\n    with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:\n        reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n        for row in reader:\n            # Split the name into first and last names\n            name_parts = row['Name'].split()\n            first_name = name_parts[0]\n            last_name = name_parts[-1]\n            email = row['Email']\n            # Append the data as a dictionary\n            data.append({'First Name': first_name, 'Last Name': last_name, 'Email': email})\n    \n    # Sort the data by last name\n    sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x['Last Name'])\n    \n    # Print the sorted data\n    for entry in sorted_data:\n        print(f\"{entry['First Name']} {entry['Last Name']}, {entry['Email']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Reading the CSV File:**\n   - We use `csv.DictReader` to read the CSV file, which allows us to access columns by their header names.\n   - For each row, we split the 'Name' field into first and last names. This assumes that the last part is the last name, which works for names with multiple spaces.\n\n2. **Storing Data:**\n   - We store each entry as a dictionary in a list, with keys 'First Name', 'Last Name', and 'Email'.\n\n3. **Sorting the Data:**\n   - We sort the list of dictionaries by the 'Last Name' key using the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key argument.\n\n4. **Printing the Sorted Data:**\n   - We iterate through the sorted list and print each entry in the format \"First Last, Email\".\n\nThis script should work for basic cases where names are straightforward. However, for more complex names (e.g., those with prefixes or multiple last names), additional handling may be necessary."
