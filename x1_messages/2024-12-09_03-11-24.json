        "content": "So the factory makes 250 units every day, and it works for 5 days a week. To find out how many units are made in a week, I just need to multiply the daily production by the number of days it operates each week. So that would be 250 units/day times 5 days/week. Let me do the math: 250 times 5 is 1250. So, the factory produces 1250 units each week.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Maybe holidays or maintenance days, but the question says it operates 5 days each week, so I think 1250 is the correct answer. It seems straightforward. But just to be sure, let's think about it differently. If the factory makes 250 units each day and works 5 days a week, then over 7 days, it only works 5 days. So, again, 250 times 5 is 1250 units per week.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. **Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1250} \\]"
