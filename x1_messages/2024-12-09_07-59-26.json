        "content": "So if someone makes $4000 a month and saves 20% of that each month, we want to know how much they'll have saved after a year, right? Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much they save each month. If they save 20% of their $4000 salary, we can calculate that by multiplying 4000 by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form). So, 4000 times 0.20 equals 800. That means they save $800 every month.\n\nNow, there are 12 months in a year, so to find out the total savings after one year, we'll multiply the monthly savings by 12. So, 800 times 12 equals 9600.\n\nTherefore, after one year, they would have saved $9600.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If they save 20% every month, does that mean they're saving 20% of their annual salary?\n\nWell, if their monthly salary is $4000, then their annual salary would be 4000 times 12, which is 48,000. If they save 20% of that annually, it would be 48,000 times 0.20, which also equals 9600. So, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider if they have any expenses or if the 20% saving is the only amount they set aside. But according to the problem, they save 20% every month, so we can assume that's the only savings rate, and there are no other variables mentioned.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that we're not considering any interest or investment returns on the saved amount, as the question seems to be focusing solely on the savings from the monthly salary.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after one year, they would have saved $9600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9600} \\]"
