        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The factory originally produces 1000 widgets per day. They decide to increase production by 50% due to higher demand. So first, I need to calculate the new daily production rate.\n\nIncreasing production by 50% means they're adding half of the original production to the daily output. Half of 1000 is 500, so the new daily production is 1000 + 500 = 1500 widgets per day.\n\nNow, this increased production continues for one week. Assuming a week has 7 days, the total production for the week would be 1500 widgets/day * 7 days = 10,500 widgets.\n\nHowever, it turns out that 10% of the widgets produced during this week are defective. So, to find out how many non-defective widgets there are, I first need to calculate how many are defective.\n\n10% of 10,500 is 1,050 widgets. Therefore, the number of non-defective widgets is the total production minus the defective ones: 10,500 - 1,050 = 9,450 widgets.\n\nSo, the factory produced 9,450 non-defective widgets in that week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9450} \\]"
