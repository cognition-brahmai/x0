        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to write a Python function that removes duplicates from a list, but I can't use any built-in functions or methods. That sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is required. I have to remove duplicates from a list, meaning that if there are multiple occurrences of the same element, I should keep only one instance of it. And I can't use any built-in functions or methods to do this. So, no using things like set() or list comprehensions that might make this easier.\n\nLet me think about how lists work in Python. A list is an ordered collection of items, and it can contain duplicates. So, if I have a list like [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], I need to transform it into [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nSince I can't use built-in functions or methods, I probably need to iterate through the list and keep track of which elements I've already seen. That way, I can avoid adding duplicates to a new list.\n\nOne way to keep track of seen elements is to use another list, but that seems inefficient because checking if an element is already in the list would require another loop each time, leading to a O(n^2) time complexity. That doesn't sound great, especially for large lists.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a dictionary to keep track of seen elements, since dictionary lookups are fast. But wait, dictionaries are built-in types, and the problem says not to use any built-in functions or methods. I'm not sure if using a dictionary counts as using a built-in type, but I think it might be allowed since we're just using the data structure, not any of its methods like dict.keys() or dict.values().\n\nActually, thinking about it, dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables, which allow for average O(1) lookup time. So, if I can use dictionaries without using any methods on them, that might be a efficient way to go.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary and an empty list.\n\n2. Iterate through each element in the original list.\n\n3. For each element, check if it is already a key in the dictionary.\n\n- If it's not, add it to the dictionary with any value (since we're using it just as a set), and also append it to the new list.\n\n- If it is already a key, skip it.\n\n4. After iterating through the entire list, return the new list.\n\nWait a minute, but dictionaries in Python 3.7 and later preserve insertion order, so the order of elements in the new list should match the order in which they first appeared in the original list.\n\nI need to make sure that the function works correctly and doesn't use any built-in functions or methods. That means I shouldn't use things like len(), append() method, or anything like that.\n\nBut hold on, if I can't use the append() method, how am I supposed to build the new list? Because in Python, lists are dynamically sized, and append() is the standard way to add elements to a list.\n\nMaybe the restriction is only on functions and methods that directly remove duplicates, like using set(), list comprehension with if conditions, or the remove() method. Perhaps I'm misinterpreting the instruction.\n\nLet me read the instruction again: \"Write a Python function that removes duplicates from a list without using any built-in functions or methods.\"\n\nHmm, this is ambiguous. Does \"without using any built-in functions or methods\" mean I can't use any functions or methods provided by Python, or just those that directly relate to removing duplicates?\n\nIf it's the former, then I can't use anything like len(), append(), for loops, etc., which would make the task impossible because I need some way to iterate and build the new list.\n\nProbably, the intention is to not use functions or methods that directly handle removing duplicates, like set() or list comprehension with uniqueness conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spirit of the exercise is to implement the functionality from scratch, without relying on Python's built-in capabilities for removing duplicates.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I can use basic list operations, but not higher-level functions that abstract away the details.\n\nLet me consider an approach where I iterate through the list using a for loop, and manually check for duplicates by comparing each element with all previous elements.\n\nHere's how that might work:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list to store unique elements.\n\n2. Iterate through each element in the original list.\n\n3. For each element, check if it already exists in the unique list.\n\n- To check for existence, iterate through the unique list and compare each element.\n\n- If the element is not found in the unique list, add it.\n\n4. After processing all elements, return the unique list.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) because for each element, we may have to scan the entire unique list.\n\nFor large lists, this could be inefficient, but given the constraints, it might be acceptable.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this without using any built-in functions or methods.\n\nWait, but I need some way to iterate and check equality. Are equality checks allowed? I think equality is a basic language feature, not a built-in function.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, define a function, say, remove_duplicates, that takes a list as input.\n\nThen, initialize an empty list, maybe using the list literal [].\n\nThen, loop through each element in the input list.\n\nFor each element, check if it is in the unique list.\n\nIf it's not, add it to the unique list.\n\nFinally, return the unique list.\n\nBut, as mentioned earlier, the 'in' operator is a built-in feature, and so is the append() method.\n\nIf I can't use these, then how can I check for existence and add elements to the list?\n\nMaybe I need to implement my own list structure and methods.\n\nBut that seems overly complicated and probably not what's intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use list indices to manually check for duplicates.\n\nFor example, iterate through the input list, and for each element, check if it matches any element in the unique list by indexing each position.\n\nIf no match is found, add it to the unique list.\n\nBut again, adding to the list would require using append(), which is a method.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the '+' operator to concatenate lists.\n\nSo, instead of using append(), I can do unique_list = unique_list + [element].\n\nIs '+' considered a built-in function or method? I think it's an operator, so maybe it's allowed.\n\nSimilarly, the '==' operator for equality checking should be fine.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is acceptable.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out.\n\nDefine a function remove_duplicates:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n\nunique_list = []\n\nfor element in input_list:\n\nif element not in unique_list:\n\nunique_list = unique_list + [element]\n\nreturn unique_list\n\nBut wait, 'not in' is using the 'in' operator, which is a built-in feature.\n\nIf the instruction is to not use any built-in functions or methods, then maybe even 'in' is not allowed.\n\nThis is getting tricky.\n\nMaybe I need to iterate through unique_list using indices and check each element manually.\n\nHere's an attempt:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n\nunique_list = []\n\nfor element in input_list:\n\nfound = False\n\nfor i in range(len(unique_list)):\n\nif unique_list[i] == element:\n\nfound = True\n\nbreak\n\nif not found:\n\nunique_list = unique_list + [element]\n\nreturn unique_list\n\nBut in this code, I'm using 'range()', 'len()', and '=='.\n\nIs 'range()' a built-in function? Yes, it is.\n\nIs 'len()' a built-in function? Yes.\n\nIs '==' a built-in feature? Probably.\n\nThis seems to be violating the instruction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can iterate through unique_list using a while loop and indices.\n\nSomething like:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n\nunique_list = []\n\nindex = 0\n\nfor element in input_list:\n\nfound = False\n\nwhile index < len(unique_list):\n\nif unique_list[index] == element:\n\nfound = True\n\nbreak\n\nindex += 1\n\nif not found:\n\nunique_list = unique_list + [element]\n\nreturn unique_list\n\nBut again, 'len()' is a built-in function.\n\nThis is getting too restrictive.\n\nMaybe the instruction doesn't intend to ban all built-in functions and methods, but only those that directly relate to removing duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use recursion to build the unique list.\n\nBut recursion would still require some way to check for existence, which brings me back to the same problem.\n\nAnother idea: Since I can't use built-in functions or methods, maybe I need to implement my own versions of these functions.\n\nFor example, implement my own version of 'in' operator or 'len()' function.\n\nBut that seems like going down a rabbit hole.\n\nMoreover, implementing 'len()' without using built-in functions would be challenging.\n\nI think I need to seek clarification on what exactly is allowed and what isn't.\n\nBut since I can't do that, I'll assume that I can use basic language features like variables, assignments, loops, conditionals, and operators like '==', '+', etc., but not built-in functions like len(), range(), append(), etc.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the earlier approach using 'in' operator and '+' for list concatenation is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to use a generator or some other construct to avoid using prohibited functions.\n\nBut that might be overly complicated.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nI can iterate through the input list and build a unique list by checking each element against the unique list.\n\nTo check if an element is already in the unique list, I can iterate through the unique list using a loop and compare each element.\n\nIf none match, add it using list concatenation.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n\nunique_list = []\n\nfor element in input_list:\n\nduplicate = False\n\nfor unique_element in unique_list:\n\nif unique_element == element:\n\nduplicate = True\n\nbreak\n\nif not duplicate:\n\nunique_list = unique_list + [element]\n\nreturn unique_list\n\nThis seems acceptable, assuming that the 'in' operator and '+' for lists are allowed.\n\nBut earlier, I thought 'in' might not be allowed.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to avoid using 'in' by iterating through indices.\n\nHere's another version:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n\nunique_list = []\n\nindex = 0\n\nfor element in input_list:\n\nduplicate = False\n\nwhile index < len(unique_list):\n\nif unique_list[index] == element:\n\nduplicate = True\n\nbreak\n\nindex += 1\n\nif not duplicate:\n\nunique_list = unique_list + [element]\n\nreturn unique_list\n\nAgain, this uses 'len()', which might not be allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I can iterate through the unique_list using a for loop without indices.\n\nLike this:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n\nunique_list = []\n\nfor element in input_list:\n\nduplicate = False\n\nfor unique_element in unique_list:\n\nif unique_element == element:\n\nduplicate = True\n\nbreak\n\nif not duplicate:\n\nunique_list = unique_list + [element]\n\nreturn unique_list\n\nThis way, I'm not using 'len()' or 'range()'.\n\nI'm only using '==' for equality and '+' for list concatenation.\n\nI think this might be acceptable, assuming that 'in' is not allowed, but basic operators are.\n\nLet me test this function with an example.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n\nProcessing:\n\n- Start with unique_list = []\n\n- Check 1: not in unique_list, so unique_list = [1]\n\n- Check 2: not in unique_list, so unique_list = [1, 2]\n\n- Check 2: already in unique_list, skip\n\n- Check 3: not in unique_list, so unique_list = [1, 2, 3]\n\n- Check 4: not in unique_list, so unique_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n- Check 4: already in unique_list, skip\n\n- Check 5: not in unique_list, so unique_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n- Final output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAnother test case: Empty list.\n\nInput: []\n\nProcessing: Nothing to do, output: []\n\nCorrect.\n\nInput with all duplicates:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nProcessing:\n\n- unique_list starts as []\n\n- Check 1: not in unique_list, unique_list = [1]\n\n- Subsequent 1's are duplicates, skipped\n\n- Output: [1]\n\nCorrect.\n\nInput with no duplicates:\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nProcessing:\n\n- unique_list starts as []\n\n- Each element not in unique_list, so unique_list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n- Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nCorrect.\n\nSeems like this function works as expected.\n\nNow, regarding the efficiency, as I mentioned earlier, this has O(n^2) time complexity because for each element, we may have to scan the entire unique_list.\n\nFor large lists, this could be slow, but given the constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if I were allowed to use a dictionary, I could implement a more efficient solution with O(n) time complexity, but since that's not permitted, this will have to do.\n\nIn conclusion, here's the function:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n\nunique_list = []\n\nfor element in input_list:\n\nduplicate = False\n\nfor unique_element in unique_list:\n\nif unique_element == element:\n\nduplicate = True\n\nbreak\n\nif not duplicate:\n\nunique_list = unique_list + [element]\n\nreturn unique_list\n\nI'll consider this as the final answer, assuming that basic operators like '==' and '+' are allowed, even if 'in' is not.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo remove duplicates from a list without using any built-in functions or methods, we can implement a custom function that manually checks for duplicates and builds a new list with only unique elements.\n\n## Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty list to store unique elements.\n2. **Iteration**: Loop through each element in the original list.\n3. **Duplicate Check**: For each element, check if it already exists in the unique list by comparing it to each element in the unique list.\n4. **Add Unique Elements**: If the element is not found in the unique list, append it to the unique list using list concatenation.\n5. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, return the unique list.\n\nThis approach ensures that we do not use any built-in functions or methods for removing duplicates, adhering to the constraints provided.\n\n## Solution Code\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n    unique_list = []\n    for element in input_list:\n        duplicate = False\n        for unique_element in unique_list:\n            if unique_element == element:\n                duplicate = True\n                break\n        if not duplicate:\n            unique_list = unique_list + [element]\n    return unique_list\n```\n\n## Explanation\n- **Step-by-Step Execution**:\n  - We initialize an empty list `unique_list` to store unique elements.\n  - For each element in the input list, we check if it already exists in `unique_list` by iterating through `unique_list` and comparing each element.\n  - If the element is not found in `unique_list`, we add it to `unique_list` using list concatenation.\n  - Finally, we return `unique_list` which contains only unique elements from the input list.\n\n- **Efficiency**:\n  - The time complexity is O(n^2) because, in the worst case, for each element in the input list, we might need to iterate through all elements in `unique_list`.\n  - This approach is simple and ensures that no built-in functions or methods are used to remove duplicates."
