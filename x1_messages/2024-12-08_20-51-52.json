        "content": "So, I've got this information here about Albert Einstein. It says that he was a theoretical physicist who came up with the theory of relativity. That sounds really important. Anyway, the interesting part is that he didn't start speaking until he was four years old and didn't read until he was seven. His parents actually thought he might be intellectually disabled. Can you imagine that? One of the greatest minds in history, and his own parents thought he was disabled.\n\nBut, despite those early challenges, he ended up winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. That's amazing! It just shows that sometimes, people develop at their own pace, and early indicators aren't always accurate predictors of future success.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: Albert Einstein started speaking at age four and reading at age seven. Yes, he did win a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\n\nIt's fascinating to think about how different life was back then, and how people's perceptions of intelligence and development have changed over time. I wonder what Einstein himself would say about his late start in speaking and reading. Maybe he had his own way of processing information that just took a bit longer to express.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized physics and our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It's a cornerstone of modern physics, and his work continues to influence scientific research today.\n\nOverall, Einstein's story is one of perseverance and intellectual curiosity, despite initial challenges in his early years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Albert Einstein started speaking at age four, reading at age seven, and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.}} \\]"
