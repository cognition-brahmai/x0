        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about marbles in a jar. There are red, blue, and green marbles, and I need to figure out how many blue marbles there are. Okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, it says there are twice as many red marbles as blue marbles. So, if I let the number of blue marbles be B, then the number of red marbles would be 2B, right? Because it's twice as many.\n\nNext, it says there are three times as many green marbles as red marbles. So, if red marbles are 2B, then green marbles would be 3 times that, which is 3 * 2B = 6B.\n\nNow, the total number of marbles is 72. So, all the marbles together\u2014red, blue, and green\u2014add up to 72. That means B + 2B + 6B = 72.\n\nLet me write that down: B + 2B + 6B = 72.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 9B = 72.\n\nNow, to find B, I just need to divide both sides by 9.\n\nSo, B = 72 / 9 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 blue marbles in the jar.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf B = 8, then red marbles are 2 * 8 = 16.\n\nGreen marbles are 3 * 16 = 48.\n\nNow, 8 + 16 + 48 = 72.\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the answer is 8 blue marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
