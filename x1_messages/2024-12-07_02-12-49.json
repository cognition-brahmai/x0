        "content": "Well, tennis is popular all around the world, but some countries have a particularly strong tennis culture. For example, countries like Australia, Spain, and the United States have produced many top-ranked tennis players and have a large number of tennis courts and clubs. So, it's safe to say that in these countries, a significant portion of the population enjoys playing tennis. But if I had to pick one where most people love playing tennis, I might go with Australia, as it has a strong tennis tradition and a high number of tennis players per capita."
