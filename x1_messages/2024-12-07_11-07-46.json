Therefore, their distances from New York City are identical at that moment. It doesn't matter what their speeds are; once they meet, they are both at the same location, hence equidistant from New York City.\n\nTo put it another way, the distance each train has traveled depends on its speed and the time traveled, but since they meet at a single point, their distances from New York City are the same at that instant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Both trains are equally close to New York City when they meet.}} \\]"
