        "content": "So the hospital wants to improve its emergency response time by adding more ambulances. They currently have 15 ambulances that can handle an average of 100 emergencies per day. Their goal is to increase their capacity by 25%. I need to figure out how many additional ambulances they need to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 25% increase in capacity means. If they currently handle 100 emergencies per day, a 25% increase would be:\n\n100 emergencies/day * 25% = 25 emergencies/day\n\nSo, they want to handle an additional 25 emergencies per day, bringing their total capacity to:\n\n100 emergencies/day + 25 emergencies/day = 125 emergencies/day\n\nNow, I need to find out how many ambulances are required to handle this increased load. I know that currently, 15 ambulances handle 100 emergencies per day. So, I can calculate the number of emergencies each ambulance handles per day:\n\n100 emergencies/day / 15 ambulances = approximately 6.67 emergencies/ambulance/day\n\nNow, if each ambulance can handle the same number of emergencies per day, and they need to handle 125 emergencies per day, I can calculate the total number of ambulances needed:\n\n125 emergencies/day / 6.67 emergencies/ambulance/day = approximately 18.75 ambulances\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of an ambulance, they would need to round up to the next whole number, which is 19 ambulances.\n\nNow, to find out how many additional ambulances are needed, I subtract the current number of ambulances from the total required:\n\n19 ambulances - 15 ambulances = 4 ambulances\n\nSo, they need to add 4 additional ambulances to achieve a 25% increase in capacity.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If 15 ambulances handle 100 emergencies, and they want to handle 125 emergencies, perhaps I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nNumber of ambulances / Number of emergencies = constant, if each ambulance handles the same number of emergencies per day.\n\nSo,\n\n15 ambulances / 100 emergencies = x ambulances / 125 emergencies\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (15 * 125) / 100 = 18.75 ambulances\n\nAgain, rounding up to 19 ambulances, which means 4 additional ambulances are needed.\n\nAlternatively, since they want a 25% increase in capacity, maybe I can apply that percentage directly to the number of ambulances.\n\nIf 15 ambulances give 100 emergencies, and they want 25% more emergencies, which is 125 emergencies, perhaps I can calculate 25% of the current ambulance count and add it to the current number.\n\n25% of 15 ambulances is:\n\n15 * 25% = 3.75 ambulances\n\nAgain, rounding up to 4 ambulances, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, in all three methods, I arrive at the same conclusion that they need to add 4 additional ambulances.\n\nBut let me think about this some more. Maybe there's a more efficient way to handle this increase in capacity. Perhaps by optimizing the response time or improving the efficiency of the ambulances they already have.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that they want to add more ambulances to improve response time, so assuming that adding more ambulances is the approach they're taking, and each ambulance handles the same number of emergencies per day, then the calculation seems straightforward.\n\nIt's also important to consider that response time might not only depend on the number of ambulances but also on other factors like traffic, distance to emergencies, and workforce availability. But based on the information provided, the focus is on increasing the number of ambulances to handle more emergencies.\n\nMoreover, in reality, emergency services might have different capacities based on the type of emergency and the resources required, but in this scenario, we're assuming that each ambulance can handle the same number of emergencies per day.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all ambulances are in service all the time. There might be maintenance, cleaning, or other non-emergency tasks that keep ambulances unavailable at certain times. However, since the question doesn't specify any such constraints, I'll assume that all ambulances are available for emergency response.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are regulations or standards for the number of emergencies an ambulance can handle in a day, but again, without specific information, I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nSo, to summarize, the hospital needs to add 4 additional ambulances to increase their emergency handling capacity by 25%, assuming each ambulance can handle the same number of emergencies per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
