        "content": "Let's see. I have this recursive sequence defined by a(n+1) = a(n) - n, and it starts with a(1) = 5. I need to find out what a(6) is. Okay, so recursive sequences mean each term is based on the previous one. So, I'll probably have to calculate each term step by step from a(1) up to a(6).\n\nStarting with a(1) = 5.\n\nThen, a(2) = a(1) - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nNext, a(3) = a(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nThen, a(4) = a(3) - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1.\n\nA(5) = a(4) - 4 = -1 - 4 = -5.\n\nFinally, a(6) = a(5) - 5 = -5 - 5 = -10.\n\nSo, a(6) is -10.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to confirm this.\n\nLet's try to find a general formula for a(n).\n\nGiven a(n+1) = a(n) - n, and a(1) = 5.\n\nThis is a linear recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a(n).\n\nLet me try to write down the first few terms again:\n\na1 = 5\n\na2 = a1 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\na3 = a2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\n\na4 = a3 - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1\n\na5 = a4 - 4 = -1 - 4 = -5\n\na6 = a5 - 5 = -5 - 5 = -10\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's see:\n\na1 = 5\n\na2 = 5 - 1\n\na3 = 5 - 1 - 2\n\na4 = 5 - 1 - 2 - 3\n\na5 = 5 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4\n\na6 = 5 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5\n\nSo, it looks like a(n) = a(1) - (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1))\n\nI know that the sum of the first (n-1) positive integers is (n-1)n/2.\n\nTherefore, a(n) = 5 - [(n-1)n]/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=2:\n\na(2) = 5 - (1*2)/2 = 5 - 1 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=3: 5 - (2*3)/2 = 5 - 3 = 2, correct.\n\nn=4: 5 - (3*4)/2 = 5 - 6 = -1, correct.\n\nn=5: 5 - (4*5)/2 = 5 - 10 = -5, correct.\n\nn=6: 5 - (5*6)/2 = 5 - 15 = -10, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the general formula is a(n) = 5 - [n(n-1)/2]\n\nTherefore, a(6) = 5 - [6*5/2] = 5 - 15 = -10.\n\nAlternatively, I could derive the general formula more formally.\n\nGiven a(n+1) = a(n) - n, with a(1) = 5.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a(n+1) - a(n) = -n.\n\nWait, actually, it's a(n+1) = a(n) - n, so a(n+1) - a(n) = -n.\n\nTo solve this, I can use the method of summation.\n\nStarting from a(1) = 5,\n\na(2) - a(1) = -1\n\na(3) - a(2) = -2\n\na(4) - a(3) = -3\n\n...\n\na(n) - a(n-1) = -(n-1)\n\nNow, summing these equations from k=1 to k=n-1:\n\nSum from k=1 to n-1 of [a(k+1) - a(k)] = sum from k=1 to n-1 of (-k)\n\nThe left side telescopes to a(n) - a(1)\n\nThe right side is -sum from k=1 to n-1 of k = -[ (n-1)n ] / 2\n\nTherefore, a(n) - 5 = -[(n-1)n]/2\n\nSo, a(n) = 5 - [(n-1)n]/2\n\nWhich confirms the formula I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, a(6) = 5 - [(6-1)*6]/2 = 5 - (5*6)/2 = 5 - 15 = -10.\n\nAlternatively, I could use induction to prove the general formula.\n\nBase case: n=1\n\na(1) = 5 - [0*1]/2 = 5 - 0 = 5, which matches.\n\nInductive step: Assume a(k) = 5 - [k(k-1)/2] for some k >=1.\n\nThen a(k+1) = a(k) - k = [5 - k(k-1)/2] - k = 5 - [k(k-1)/2 + k] = 5 - [k(k-1) + 2k]/2 = 5 - [k^2 - k + 2k]/2 = 5 - [k^2 + k]/2 = 5 - [k(k+1)/2]\n\nWhich is the formula a(k+1) = 5 - [k(k+1)/2], which matches the general formula.\n\nTherefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n >=1.\n\nHence, a(6) = 5 - [5*6]/2 = 5 - 15 = -10.\n\nSo, the answer is a(6) = -10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-10} \\]"
