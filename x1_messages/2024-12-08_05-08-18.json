        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, I have a drawer with only black and white socks. If I pick two socks at random, the probability that both are black is 1/3. I need to find out what fraction of the socks are black.\n\nFirst, I should probably think about how probability works in this scenario. If there are only black and white socks, the total number of socks is the sum of black and white socks. Let's denote the number of black socks as B and the number of white socks as W. So, the total number of socks is B + W.\n\nNow, the probability of picking two black socks without replacement is given by the number of ways to pick two black socks divided by the total number of ways to pick any two socks.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two black socks is the combination of B socks taken 2 at a time, which is B choose 2, or C(B, 2). Similarly, the total number of ways to pick any two socks is C(B + W, 2).\n\nSo, the probability P of picking two black socks is:\n\nP = C(B, 2) / C(B + W, 2) = 1/3\n\nI need to express this in terms of fractions. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So,\n\nC(B, 2) = B(B - 1)/2\n\nC(B + W, 2) = (B + W)(B + W - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, P = [B(B - 1)/2] / [(B + W)(B + W - 1)/2] = [B(B - 1)] / [(B + W)(B + W - 1)] = 1/3\n\nSo, [B(B - 1)] / [(B + W)(B + W - 1)] = 1/3\n\nI need to solve for B/(B + W), which is the fraction of black socks.\n\nLet me denote f = B/(B + W), which is the fraction I'm trying to find.\n\nThen, B = f(B + W)\n\nAnd W = (1 - f)(B + W)\n\nSubstituting these into the probability equation:\n\n[f(B + W)(f(B + W) - 1)] / [(B + W)(B + W - 1)] = 1/3\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: f(B + W)(f(B + W) - 1) = f(B + W)(f(B + W) - 1)\n\nDenominator: (B + W)(B + W - 1)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[f(B + W)(f(B + W) - 1)] / [(B + W)(B + W - 1)] = 1/3\n\nI can cancel (B + W) from numerator and denominator:\n\n[f(f(B + W) - 1)] / (B + W - 1) = 1/3\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider expressing everything in terms of f.\n\nSince f = B/(B + W), then B = fT and W = (1 - f)T, where T is the total number of socks.\n\nBut T = B + W, so this holds.\n\nSubstituting into the probability equation:\n\nP = [B(B - 1)] / [(B + W)(B + W - 1)] = [fT(fT - 1)] / [T(T - 1)] = 1/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n[fT(fT - 1)] / [T(T - 1)] = f^2 (T - 1/T) / (T - 1) = f^2 (1 - 1/T) = 1/3\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should consider that T is large, so 1/T is small, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can think in terms of probabilities without specifying the numbers.\n\nThe probability of picking two black socks is P(BB) = P(B on first draw) * P(B on second draw | B on first draw)\n\nWe know P(BB) = 1/3\n\nLet P(B) be the probability of drawing a black sock on the first draw, which is B/(B + W) = f\n\nThen, P(B on second draw | B on first draw) = (B - 1)/(B + W - 1)\n\nSo, P(BB) = f * [(B - 1)/(B + W - 1)] = 1/3\n\nBut B = f(B + W), so substitute:\n\nP(BB) = f * [(f(B + W) - 1)/(B + W - 1)] = 1/3\n\nThis seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I need to express this equation in terms of f and solve for f.\n\nLet me denote T = B + W, then B = fT and W = (1 - f)T\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nP(BB) = f * [(fT - 1)/(T - 1)] = 1/3\n\nSo, f*(fT - 1)/(T - 1) = 1/3\n\nMultiply both sides by (T - 1):\n\nf(fT - 1) = (T - 1)/3\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nf^2 T - f = (T - 1)/3\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nf^2 T - f - (T - 1)/3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in terms of f, but it's a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the ratio of black to total socks.\n\nLet me consider small numbers and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nSuppose there are B black socks and W white socks, with total T = B + W.\n\nThe probability of picking two black socks is C(B, 2)/C(T, 2) = 1/3\n\nC(B, 2) = B(B - 1)/2\n\nC(T, 2) = T(T - 1)/2\n\nSo, [B(B - 1)/2] / [T(T - 1)/2] = B(B - 1)/T(T - 1) = 1/3\n\nTherefore, B(B - 1) = (T(T - 1))/3\n\nBut T = B + W, and W = T - B\n\nI need to express this in terms of f = B/T\n\nSo, B = fT\n\nSubstitute:\n\nfT(fT - 1) = (T(T - 1))/3\n\nSimplify:\n\nf^2 T^2 - fT = (T^2 - T)/3\n\nDivide both sides by T (assuming T \u2260 0):\n\nf^2 T - f = (T - 1)/3\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nf^2 T - f - (T - 1)/3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n3f^2 T - 3f - (T - 1) = 0\n\nRearrange:\n\n3f^2 T - 3f - T + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of f. Let's rearrange it:\n\n3f^2 T - 3f - T + 1 = 0\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(3T f^2 - 3f) + (-T + 1) = 0\n\nThis seems complicated to solve directly. Maybe I can think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume a specific number of socks to make the calculation easier.\n\nLet's assume there are T socks in total.\n\nThen, B = fT and W = (1 - f)T\n\nSubstitute into the probability equation:\n\nP(BB) = [B(B - 1)] / [T(T - 1)] = 1/3\n\nSo, [fT(fT - 1)] / [T(T - 1)] = 1/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n[fT(fT - 1)] / [T(T - 1)] = f^2 (T - 1/T) / (T - 1) \u2248 f^2 / 1 = f^2 (for large T)\n\nBut this approximation only holds for large T, which might not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that T is large, so 1/T is small, and approximate.\n\nBut maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nLet me try to solve the equation without approximations.\n\nStarting from:\n\nf^2 T - f - (T - 1)/3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3f^2 T - 3f - T + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in f:\n\n3T f^2 - 3f - T + 1 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nf = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 12T(T - 1))] / (6T)\n\nWait, actually, the quadratic formula for af^2 + bf + c = 0 is f = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nIn this case, a = 3T, b = -3, c = -T + 1\n\nSo, f = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 12T(T - 1))] / (6T)\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n9 + 12T(T - 1) = 9 + 12T^2 - 12T = 12T^2 - 12T + 9\n\nThis can be factored as 3(4T^2 - 4T + 3)\n\nSo, f = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(3(4T^2 - 4T + 3))] / (6T)\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the ratio of black socks differently.\n\nLet me consider that the probability of picking two black socks is 1/3.\n\nLet me denote the total number of socks as n, and the number of black socks as k.\n\nThen, P(BB) = C(k, 2)/C(n, 2) = 1/3\n\nC(k, 2) = k(k - 1)/2\n\nC(n, 2) = n(n - 1)/2\n\nSo, [k(k - 1)/2] / [n(n - 1)/2] = k(k - 1)/n(n - 1) = 1/3\n\nTherefore, k(k - 1) = n(n - 1)/3\n\nI need to find k/n.\n\nLet me denote f = k/n, so k = f n\n\nSubstitute:\n\nf n (f n - 1) = n(n - 1)/3\n\nSimplify:\n\nf^2 n^2 - f n = (n^2 - n)/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3 f^2 n^2 - 3 f n = n^2 - n\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3 f^2 n^2 - 3 f n - n^2 + n = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nn(3 f^2 n - 3 f - n + 1) = 0\n\nSince n \u2260 0, we have:\n\n3 f^2 n - 3 f - n + 1 = 0\n\nThis is still a bit messy. Maybe I can consider specific values for n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet's try n = 3.\n\nThen, k(k - 1) = 3(3 - 1)/3 = 2\n\nSo, k(k - 1) = 2\n\nPossible k: k=2, since 2*1=2\n\nSo, k=2, n=3, f=2/3\n\nCheck P(BB): C(2,2)/C(3,2) = 1/3, which matches.\n\nBut let's check for n=4.\n\nk(k - 1) = 4(3)/3 = 4\n\nSo, k(k - 1) = 4\n\nPossible k=3, since 3*2=6, which is too big\n\nk=2, 2*1=2, which is less\n\nSo, no integer k satisfies for n=4.\n\nn=5:\n\nk(k - 1) = 5*4/3 = 20/3 \u22486.666, not an integer.\n\nNo solution.\n\nn=6:\n\nk(k - 1) = 6*5/3 = 10\n\nSo, k(k - 1) = 10\n\nk=5, 5*4=20 too big\n\nk=4, 4*3=12, too big\n\nk=3, 3*2=6, too small\n\nNo solution.\n\nn=7:\n\nk(k - 1) = 7*6/3 = 14\n\nk=4, 4*3=12 <14\n\nk=5, 5*4=20 >14\n\nNo solution.\n\nn=8:\n\nk(k - 1) = 8*7/3 = 56/3 \u224818.666, not integer.\n\nNo solution.\n\nn=9:\n\nk(k - 1) = 9*8/3 = 24\n\nk=5, 5*4=20 <24\n\nk=6, 6*5=30 >24\n\nNo solution.\n\nn=10:\n\nk(k - 1) =10*9/3=30\n\nk=6,6*5=30, perfect.\n\nSo, k=6, n=10, f=6/10=3/5\n\nCheck P(BB): C(6,2)/C(10,2)=15/45=1/3, correct.\n\nAnother solution.\n\nn=3, k=2, f=2/3\n\nn=10, k=6, f=3/5\n\nAre there more solutions?\n\nn=15:\n\nk(k - 1)=15*14/3=70\n\nk=9,9*8=72>70\n\nk=8,8*7=56<70\n\nNo solution.\n\nn=15:\n\nWait, maybe n=15:\n\nk(k - 1)=15*14/3=70\n\nWe need k(k - 1)=70\n\nSolve k^2 - k -70=0\n\nDiscriminant=1+280=281, not a perfect square.\n\nNo integer solution.\n\nn=21:\n\nk(k - 1)=21*20/3=140\n\nk=14,14*13=182>140\n\nk=13,13*12=156>140\n\nk=12,12*11=132<140\n\nNo solution.\n\nn=28:\n\nk(k - 1)=28*27/3=252\n\nk=16,16*15=240<252\n\nk=17,17*16=272>252\n\nNo solution.\n\nn=36:\n\nk(k - 1)=36*35/3=420\n\nk=21,21*20=420, perfect.\n\nSo, k=21, n=36, f=21/36=7/12\n\nCheck P(BB):C(21,2)/C(36,2)=210/630=1/3, correct.\n\nAnother solution.\n\nSo, solutions are n=3,k=2; n=10,k=6; n=36,k=21; ...\n\nLooking for a pattern in f:\n\nFor n=3, f=2/3\n\nn=10, f=6/10=3/5\n\nn=36, f=21/36=7/12\n\nIs there a general formula for f?\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\n2/3, 3/5, 7/12,...\n\nNot immediately obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a recursive relationship or a formula that generates these fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that f satisfies a certain equation.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nf^2 T - f - (T - 1)/3 = 0\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n3f^2 T - 3f - T + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in f, and for integer T, f may not be rational unless T is chosen appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of f as a continued fraction or something, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that f is the golden ratio or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose there are b black socks and w white socks.\n\nTotal socks t = b + w.\n\nProbability of picking two black socks: P(BB) = (b/t)*( (b - 1)/(t - 1) ) = 1/3\n\nSo, (b/t)*((b - 1)/(t - 1)) = 1/3\n\nLet me denote f = b/t, then b = f t.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(f t / t)*((f t - 1)/(t - 1)) = f*( (f t - 1)/(t - 1) ) = 1/3\n\nSo, f*(f t - 1) = (t - 1)/3\n\nTherefore, f^2 t - f = (t - 1)/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3 f^2 t - 3 f = t - 1\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3 f^2 t - 3 f - t + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in f:\n\n3 t f^2 - 3 f - t + 1 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nf = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 12 t (t - 1))] / (6 t)\n\nSimplify inside sqrt:\n\n9 + 12 t (t - 1) = 9 + 12 t^2 - 12 t = 12 t^2 - 12 t + 9 = 3 (4 t^2 - 4 t + 3)\n\nSo, f = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(3 (4 t^2 - 4 t + 3))] / (6 t)\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I can factor or simplify further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that t is such that the expression under the square root is a perfect square.\n\nLet\u2019s set d = sqrt(3 (4 t^2 - 4 t + 3)), and require that d^2 is a perfect square.\n\nSo, d^2 = 3 (4 t^2 - 4 t + 3)\n\nI need 3 (4 t^2 - 4 t + 3) to be a perfect square.\n\nThis seems like a Diophantine equation. Maybe I can look for t such that 3 (4 t^2 - 4 t + 3) is a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a better way to parameterize the solutions.\n\nLooking back at the specific solutions I found earlier:\n\nFor t=3, b=2, f=2/3\n\nt=10, b=6, f=3/5\n\nt=36, b=21, f=7/12\n\nLooking for a pattern:\n\nf1=2/3\n\nf2=3/5\n\nf3=7/12\n\nLooking at the denominators: 3,5,12\n\nAnd numerators:2,3,7\n\nNot sure about the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference between consecutive t's:\n\n10 - 3 =7\n\n36 - 10 =26\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratios:\n\nt2/t1 =10/3 \u22483.333...\n\nt3/t2=36/10=3.6\n\nNot constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each new t is generated based on the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider a recursive relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that f satisfies a certain equation that can be solved directly.\n\nLet me consider that in the limit as t approaches infinity, f approaches some value.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\nf^2 t - f - (t - 1)/3 = 0\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the term -f becomes negligible, so f^2 t \u2248 t/3, hence f^2 \u2248 1/3, so f \u2248 sqrt(3)/3 \u22480.577\n\nBut in the finite cases, f is rational, but in the limit, it approaches an irrational number. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider expressing f in terms of t.\n\nFrom:\n\nf^2 t - f - (t - 1)/3 =0\n\nLet me solve for f:\n\nf = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 4 t (t - 1)/3)] / (2 t)\n\nWait, no, let's use the earlier expression:\n\nf = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 12 t (t - 1))] / (6 t)\n\nSimplify:\n\nf = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(12 t^2 - 12 t + 9)] / (6 t)\n\nFactor inside sqrt:\n\nsqrt(12 t^2 - 12 t + 9) = sqrt(3 (4 t^2 - 4 t + 3)) = sqrt(3) * sqrt(4 t^2 - 4 t + 3)\n\nThis doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that 4 t^2 - 4 t + 3 is three times a perfect square.\n\nLet me set 4 t^2 - 4 t + 3 = 3 m^2 for some integer m.\n\nThen, 4 t^2 - 4 t + 3 - 3 m^2 =0\n\nThis is a quadratic in t:\n\n4 t^2 - 4 t + (3 - 3 m^2) =0\n\n discriminant d = 16 - 16 (3 - 3 m^2) =16 - 48 + 48 m^2 =48 m^2 -32=16 (3 m^2 -2)\n\nFor t to be integer, d must be a perfect square, so 16 (3 m^2 -2) must be a perfect square, which implies 3 m^2 -2 is a perfect square.\n\nLet\u2019s set 3 m^2 -2 = k^2 for some integer k.\n\nSo, k^2 - 3 m^2 = -2\n\nThis is a negative Pell equation.\n\nSolutions to this equation can be found using continued fractions of sqrt(3).\n\nThe fundamental solution to x^2 - 3 y^2 =1 is (x,y)=(2,1)\n\nFor x^2 - 3 y^2 = -2, the fundamental solution is (x,y)=(1,1)\n\nThen, subsequent solutions can be generated using the fundamental unit.\n\nSo, general solutions are:\n\nx_n + y_n sqrt(3) = (1 + sqrt(3)) * (2 + sqrt(3))^n for n=0,1,2,...\n\nLet\u2019s compute some solutions:\n\nFor n=0:\n\n(1 + sqrt(3)) *1 =1 + sqrt(3) \u21d2 x=1, y=1\n\nFor n=1:\n\n(1 + sqrt(3))(2 + sqrt(3))=2 + sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(3) + 3=5 + 3 sqrt(3) \u21d2 x=5, y=3\n\nFor n=2:\n\n(1 + sqrt(3))(2 + sqrt(3))^2=(1 + sqrt(3))(7 + 4 sqrt(3))=7 + 4 sqrt(3) +7 sqrt(3) +12=19 + 11 sqrt(3) \u21d2 x=19, y=11\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, solutions are (x,y)=(1,1),(5,3),(19,11),(71,41),...\n\nNow, recall that:\n\n4 t^2 -4 t +3 =3 m^2\n\nBut m = y, and from above, y=1,3,11,41,...\n\nCorresponding x=1,5,19,71,...\n\nNow, from earlier:\n\nt = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 (3 m^2 -2))]/8 = [4 \u00b1 4 sqrt(3 m^2 -2)] /8 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(3 m^2 -2)] /2\n\nBut sqrt(3 m^2 -2) =k, from earlier.\n\nSo, t = [1 \u00b1 k]/2\n\nSince t must be positive, we take the positive sign:\n\nt = [1 + k]/2\n\nSimilarly, from x^2 -3 m^2 =-2, we have x^2 +2=3 m^2\n\nBut k^2 =3 m^2 -2, so k^2 =x^2\n\nThus, k=x\n\nTherefore, t=(1 + x)/2\n\nFrom the solutions above:\n\nFor x=1, t=(1+1)/2=1, but earlier n=3, so maybe off by one.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nFrom 4 t^2 -4 t +3 =3 m^2\n\nWe have 4 t^2 -4 t +3 -3 m^2=0\n\nThis is a quadratic in t:\n\nt = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 -

3 f - t +1 =0\n\nThen, f = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 12 t (t -1)))] / (6 t)\n\nThis is similar to what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that f is equal to 1 - f_w, where f_w is the fraction of white socks.\n\nBut f_w = w/t =1 - f\n\nThen, P(BB) = f (f - 1/t)\n\nBut P(BB) =1/3\n\nWait, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider generating functions or something, but that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for large t, f approaches sqrt(1/3), but in finite cases, f is rational.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can accept that there are multiple possible fractions f that satisfy the condition, depending on the total number of socks t.\n\nFrom the earlier solutions:\n\nFor t=3, f=2/3\n\nt=10, f=3/5\n\nt=36, f=7/12\n\nt=133, f=17/30\n\nt=490, f=41/77\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the fraction f can be any fraction in this sequence.\n\nBut perhaps there is a general formula for f in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for multiple possible fractions, depending on the total number of socks.\n\nBut maybe there's a minimal or most likely fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a specific answer, and I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me consider that the fraction f is such that f(f -

1/t), so f(f - 1/t)=1/3\n\nMultiply both sides by t(t -1):\n\nf t (f t -1) = t(t -1)/3\n\nWhich is the same as earlier: f t (f t -1) = t(t -1)/3\n\nSo, f t (f t -1) = t(t -1)/3\n\nLet me set x = f t, then:\n\nx(x -1) = t(t -1)/3\n\nSo, x^2 - x - t(t -1)/3 =0\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 4 t(t -1)/3)] / 2\n\nThen, f = x / t\n\nSo, f = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 4(t -1)/3)] / (2 t)\n\nThis is similar to what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that f satisfies a certain continued fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific forms for f.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that f is a simple fraction, like 1/2 or 2/3.\n\nBut earlier, f=2/3 worked for t=3, but for t=10, f=3/5, which is different.\n\nSo, perhaps there isn't a unique answer, or perhaps the problem expects a specific answer based on assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the limit as t approaches infinity, which is sqrt(1/3).\n\nBut since t is finite, f is rational, as seen in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that f is the golden ratio or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have f=1/2.\n\nLet me check:\n\nIf f=1/2, then f(f -1/t)=1/2*(1/2 -1/t)=1/4 -1/(2 t)\n\nSet equal to 1/3:\n\n1/4 -1/(2 t)=1/3\n\nThen, 1/(2 t)=1/4 -1/3= -1/12\n\nSo, 1/(2 t)= -1/12 \u21d2 t= -6\n\nNot possible, since t must be positive.\n\nSo, f=1/2 doesn't satisfy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f=2/3:\n\nf(f -1/t)=2/3*(2/3 -1/t)=4/9 -2/(3 t)\n\nSet equal to 1/3:\n\n4/9 -2/(3 t)=1/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 9 t:\n\n4 t -6=3 t\n\nSo, t=6\n\nThen, f=2/3, but earlier for t=3, f=2/3 worked, but for t=6, does it work?\n\nWait, for t=3, f=2/3, so b=2, w=1\n\nP(BB)= (2/3)*(1/2)=1/3, which matches.\n\nFor t=6, f=2/3, so b=4, w=2\n\nP(BB)=(4/6)*(3/5)=12/30=2/5\u22601/3\n\nSo, doesn't work.\n\nWait, contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f=3/5.\n\nFor t=10, b=6, w=4\n\nP(BB)=(6/10)*(5/9)=30/90=1/3, which matches.\n\nFor t=10, f=3/5 works.\n\nSimilarly, for t=36, f=7/12 works.\n\nSo, f=7/12 for t=36, b=21, w=15\n\nP(BB)=(21/36)*(20/35)=420/1260=1/3, correct.\n\nSo, multiple f satisfy the condition, depending on t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the minimal f, corresponding to the smallest t.\n\nThe smallest t is t=3, with f=2/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for any f in the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a general formula for f in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have f=3/5, based on t=10.\n\nBut without more constraints, it seems that f can be any fraction in the sequence corresponding to the solutions of the Diophantine equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects f=3/5, based on t=10 being a common small solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the fraction is 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the fraction is 1/2.\n\nWait, but earlier, f=1/2 didn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f=3/5 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have f=1/2, but as shown, it doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that f=\u221a(1/3), but that's irrational, and socks are integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should accept that f can be any fraction in the sequence corresponding to the solutions, and there isn't a unique answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects f=3/5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach to solve this.\n\nLet me consider that the number of ways to pick two black socks is C(b,2)=b(b-1)/2\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any two socks is C(t,2)=t(t-1)/2\n\nSo, P(BB)= [b(b-1)/2] / [t(t-1)/2] = b(b-1)/[t(t-1)] =1/3\n\nTherefore, b(b-1)= t(t-1)/3\n\nNow, since b and t are integers, t(t-1) must be divisible by 3.\n\nSo, t or t-1 must be divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, t \u22610 or 1 mod 3\n\nSo, t is a multiple of 3 or one more than a multiple of 3.\n\nFrom earlier, solutions are t=3,10,36,...\n\nWhich are t=3, t=10=3*3+1, t=36=10*3+6, hmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t follows a certain recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that t_n =4 t_{n-1} -
