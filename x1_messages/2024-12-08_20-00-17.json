        "content": "Let's see. The train travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and takes 8 hours to complete its journey, but it stops at a station for 1 hour during the trip. I need to find out how long the actual travel time was, excluding the stop time.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the total journey time includes. The total journey time of 8 hours probably includes both the travel time and the stop time. So, if the train stops for 1 hour during the trip, the actual time it was moving would be the total journey time minus the stop time.\n\nSo, actual travel time = total journey time - stop time\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nactual travel time = 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if this makes sense. The train travels at 60 miles per hour, and if it was moving for 7 hours, the distance covered would be:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 7 hours = 420 miles\n\nNow, if the total journey time is 8 hours including a 1-hour stop, then yes, the actual travel time is 7 hours.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the average speed takes into account both the moving time and the stop time. Let's think about that.\n\nAverage speed is usually total distance divided by total time. So, average speed = total distance / total time\n\nGiven that the average speed is 60 miles per hour and the total time is 8 hours, the total distance would be:\n\ntotal distance = average speed \u00d7 total time = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 480 miles\n\nNow, if the train was stopped for 1 hour, it was only moving for 7 hours. So, the distance covered while moving would be:\n\ndistance while moving = speed \u00d7 moving time = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 7 hours = 420 miles\n\nBut according to the average speed calculation, the total distance should be 480 miles. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the average speed. Perhaps the average speed is calculated based only on the moving time, not including the stop time.\n\nLet me think differently. If the train stops for 1 hour during the journey, that stop time shouldn't be included in the moving time, but it is included in the total journey time.\n\nSo, perhaps the actual travel time is still 8 hours, and the stop is an additional 1 hour, making the total time 9 hours. But that contradicts the given total journey time of 8 hours.\n\nNo, the total journey time is 8 hours, which includes the stop time. So, the train was moving for part of that 8 hours and stopped for 1 hour within that period.\n\nTherefore, the actual travel time is 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the distance using average speed and total time, it didn't match with the distance calculated using speed and moving time. Maybe I need to reconsider what average speed represents in this context.\n\nPerhaps the average speed is not 60 miles per hour over the total journey time, but only over the moving time. Let me check that.\n\nIf the train moves at 60 miles per hour for 7 hours, covering 420 miles, and stops for 1 hour, the total time is 8 hours. So, the average speed for the entire journey, including the stop, would be:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time = 420 miles / 8 hours = 52.5 miles per hour\n\nBut the problem states that the average speed is 60 miles per hour. This suggests that the average speed is 60 miles per hour, which seems inconsistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the average speed is indeed 60 miles per hour over the moving time, but not over the total journey time.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"A train travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and takes 8 hours to complete its journey. If it stops at a station for 1 hour during the trip, how long was the actual travel time?\"\n\nPerhaps the \"average speed of 60 miles per hour\" is the speed during the moving time, and the total journey time includes both moving and stopping.\n\nIf that's the case, then the moving time is total journey time minus stop time: 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, if it moves at 60 mph for 7 hours, it covers 420 miles. Then, the average speed over the total journey time would be 420 miles / 8 hours = 52.5 mph, which doesn't match the given average speed of 60 mph.\n\nThis suggests that there's some confusion in the way I'm interpreting the average speed.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe the average speed is given for the entire journey, including stops. But that seems unlikely because typically, average speed includes only the moving time.\n\nWait, let's look up the definition of average speed.\n\nAverage speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, including stops.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time\n\nGiven that, if the average speed is 60 mph and the total time is 8 hours, then:\n\ntotal distance = 60 mph \u00d7 8 hours = 480 miles\n\nNow, if the train stops for 1 hour during the journey, the moving time is 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours.\n\nDuring this moving time, it covers 480 miles at a speed of:\n\nspeed = total distance / moving time = 480 miles / 7 hours \u2248 68.57 mph\n\nBut the problem states that the train travels at an average speed of 60 mph, which now seems inconsistent with this calculation.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem: the train has an average speed of 60 mph, takes 8 hours for the journey, and stops for 1 hour during the trip. I need to find the actual travel time, excluding the stop time.\n\nIf the total journey time is 8 hours, and it stops for 1 hour, then it must be moving for 7 hours.\n\nBut according to the average speed calculation, if it's moving at 60 mph for 7 hours, it covers 420 miles, and the average speed for the entire journey would be 420 miles / 8 hours = 52.5 mph, which doesn't match the given 60 mph.\n\nThis suggests that either the average speed is not 60 mph for the entire journey or there's an error in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"average speed of 60 mph\" is only for the moving time, not including the stop time.\n\nIf that's the case, then the train moves at 60 mph for t hours and stops for 1 hour, making the total time t + 1 = 8 hours \u2192 t = 7 hours.\n\nThen, the total distance is 60 mph \u00d7 7 hours = 420 miles.\n\nThe average speed for the entire journey would be 420 miles / 8 hours = 52.5 mph, which again doesn't match the given average speed of 60 mph.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the problem might have been misstated or that there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of average speed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average speed is calculated differently in this context.\n\nLet me consider another approach: perhaps the train has an average speed of 60 mph over the moving time, and the total journey time includes both moving and stopping.\n\nIf the train moves at 60 mph for t hours and stops for 1 hour, and the total journey time is 8 hours, then t = 7 hours.\n\nThe total distance is 60 mph \u00d7 7 hours = 420 miles.\n\nIf the average speed for the entire journey is defined as total distance divided by total time, then:\n\naverage speed = 420 miles / 8 hours = 52.5 mph\n\nBut the problem states that the average speed is 60 mph, which contradicts this calculation.\n\nTherefore, there must be a mistake in the problem setup or in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average speed of 60 mph is for the entire journey, including stops.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\ntotal distance = 60 mph \u00d7 8 hours = 480 miles\n\nIf the train stops for 1 hour during the journey, the moving time is 7 hours.\n\nThen, the speed during moving time would be:\n\nspeed = total distance / moving time = 480 miles / 7 hours \u2248 68.57 mph\n\nBut the problem mentions that the train travels at an average speed of 60 mph, which now seems to be the average speed for the entire journey, including stops.\n\nIn this interpretation, the actual travel time would indeed be 7 hours, as it's the total journey time minus the stop time.\n\nHowever, there's confusion because the problem says the train travels at an average speed of 60 mph, which might be interpreted as the moving speed rather than the average speed over the entire journey.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, I'll assume that the average speed of 60 mph is for the entire journey, including stops.\n\nTherefore, total distance = 60 mph \u00d7 8 hours = 480 miles\n\nMoving time = total journey time - stop time = 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours\n\nTherefore, the actual travel time is 7 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if the average speed of 60 mph is only for the moving time, then the distance covered would be 60 mph \u00d7 t hours, and the average speed for the entire journey would be 480 miles / (t + 1) hours = given average speed.\n\nBut this leads to inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends that the moving speed is 60 mph, and there is a 1-hour stop during the 8-hour journey.\n\nIn that case, moving time = 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 7 hours = 420 miles\n\nThen, average speed for the entire journey = 420 miles / 8 hours = 52.5 mph\n\nBut the problem says the average speed is 60 mph, which doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests a mistake in the problem or in my interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the train has an average speed of 60 mph over the entire journey, including stops.\n\nIn that case:\n\ntotal distance = 60 mph \u00d7 8 hours = 480 miles\n\nMoving time = total journey time - stop time = 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours\n\nThen, the speed during moving time = total distance / moving time = 480 miles / 7 hours \u2248 68.57 mph\n\nBut the problem mentions \"travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour\", which now seems to refer to the overall average speed, including stops.\n\nGiven that, the actual travel time would be 7 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends that the train's moving speed is 60 mph, and it stops for 1 hour during an 8-hour journey.\n\nIn that case, moving time = 8 hours - 1 hour = 7 hours\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 7 hours = 420 miles\n\nThen, the average speed for the entire journey is 420 miles / 8 hours = 52.5 mph\n\nBut the problem states the average speed is 60 mph, which doesn't align.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests a problem with the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the train's average speed includes both moving and stopping, and the stopping time is factored into the average speed calculation.\n\nIn that case, if the average speed is 60 mph over 8 hours, with a 1-hour stop, the moving time would be 7 hours, as previously calculated.\n\nBut again, this leads to an inconsistency in the speed calculations.\n\nGiven these contradictions, I'll stick with the initial simple approach: total journey time is 8 hours, including a 1-hour stop, so actual travel time is 7 hours.\n\nTherefore, the actual travel time is 7 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
