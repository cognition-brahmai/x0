        "content": "So I have this problem: \"What is the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3 and a first term of 5?\" Okay, let's see. I remember that an arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. In this case, the common difference is 3, and the first term is 5.\n\nSo, the sequence would start like this: 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on, adding 3 each time. Now, I need to find the sum of the first 10 terms of this sequence.\n\nI recall there's a formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence. The formula is:\n\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first n terms,\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms,\n\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term,\n\n- \\( a_n \\) is the nth term.\n\nSo, in this problem, n is 10, \\( a_1 \\) is 5, and I need to find \\( a_{10} \\), the 10th term.\n\nFirst, let's find \\( a_{10} \\). The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \\times d \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\nGiven that \\( d = 3 \\), \\( a_1 = 5 \\), and \\( n = 10 \\), plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ a_{10} = 5 + (10 - 1) \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ a_{10} = 5 + 9 \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ a_{10} = 5 + 27 \\]\n\n\\[ a_{10} = 32 \\]\n\nAlright, so the 10th term is 32.\n\nNow, going back to the sum formula:\n\n\\[ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\times (5 + 32) \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 5 \\times 37 \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 185 \\]\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe using the formula that involves the common difference directly.\n\nI think there's another sum formula:\n\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [2a_1 + (n - 1)d] \\]\n\nLet's try this one to double-check.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\times [2 \\times 5 + (10 - 1) \\times 3] \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 5 \\times [10 + 9 \\times 3] \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 5 \\times [10 + 27] \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 5 \\times 37 \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 185 \\]\n\nOkay, both formulas give me the same answer, which is 185. So, I think that's the sum of the first 10 terms.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can calculate it manually to confirm.\n\nLet's list out the first 10 terms:\n\n1. 5\n\n2. 5 + 3 = 8\n\n3. 8 + 3 = 11\n\n4. 11 + 3 = 14\n\n5. 14 + 3 = 17\n\n6. 17 + 3 = 20\n\n7. 20 + 3 = 23\n\n8. 23 + 3 = 26\n\n9. 26 + 3 = 29\n\n10. 29 + 3 = 32\n\nNow, adding them up: 5 + 8 = 13, 13 + 11 = 24, 24 + 14 = 38, 38 + 17 = 55, 55 + 20 = 75, 75 + 23 = 98, 98 + 26 = 124, 124 + 29 = 153, 153 + 32 = 185.\n\nYep, that matches the result from the formulas. So, the sum of the first 10 terms is indeed 185.\n\nI think that's correct. But while I'm thinking about it, I wonder if there's a general way to understand why these formulas work.\n\nLet's consider the sum \\( S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n \\).\n\nSince it's an arithmetic sequence, the terms are equally spaced. So, the sum should be equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.\n\nThat is, \\( S_n = n \\times \\left( \\frac{a_1 + a_n}{2} \\right) \\), which is the same as the first formula I used.\n\nAlternatively, using the common difference, we can express \\( a_n \\) in terms of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( d \\), which leads to the second formula.\n\nSo, both formulas are consistent and derive from the same fundamental idea.\n\nJust to explore further, I recall that for an arithmetic sequence, the sum can also be thought of as the area of a trapezoid where the parallel sides are \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_n \\), and the height is \\( n \\), but since it's discrete, it's more like adding up rectangles of height equal to the term values.\n\nBut perhaps that's a bit of a stretch for this problem.\n\nIn any case, I'm confident that the sum is 185.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. Suppose I don't remember the formulas. Is there another way to approach this problem?\n\nWell, I know that in an arithmetic sequence, the terms increase by a constant amount. So, the sum would be:\n\n\\( S_{10} = 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 17 + 20 + 23 + 26 + 29 + 32 \\)\n\nAs I did earlier, adding them step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I could pair the terms from the beginning and end.\n\nSo, pair 1: 5 and 32 \u2192 sum is 37\n\nPair 2: 8 and 29 \u2192 sum is 37\n\nPair 3: 11 and 26 \u2192 sum is 37\n\nPair 4: 14 and 23 \u2192 sum is 37\n\nPair 5: 17 and 20 \u2192 sum is 37\n\nSo, there are 5 pairs, each summing to 37. Therefore, the total sum is \\( 5 \\times 37 = 185 \\).\n\nThis is another way to visualize the sum, and it reinforces the result I got from the formulas.\n\nI think this is solid. No discrepancies in any of the methods I've used.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's try calculating the sum using a different approach.\n\nSuppose I use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nBut instead of calculating \\( a_n \\) separately, maybe I can express the sum in terms of \\( a_1 \\), \\( d \\), and \\( n \\).\n\nWait, I already did that with the second formula:\n\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [2a_1 + (n - 1)d] \\]\n\nAnd I got the same answer, 185.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of the first n terms where the common difference is d:\n\n\\[ S_n = n \\times a_1 + \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\times d \\]\n\nLet's try this one.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 10 \\times 5 + \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 50 + 45 \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 50 + 135 \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = 185 \\]\n\nOnce again, the same answer.\n\nI'm starting to feel very confident about this result.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can generalize this for any arithmetic sequence.\n\nSuppose the first term is \\( a \\), and the common difference is \\( d \\), and we want the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms.\n\nThen, the nth term is \\( a + (n - 1)d \\), and the sum is:\n\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [2a + (n - 1)d] \\]\n\nOr\n\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [a + a + (n - 1)d] = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) \\]\n\nWhere \\( l \\) is the last term.\n\nAlternatively,\n\n\\[ S_n = n \\times a + \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\times d \\]\n\nAll these expressions are equivalent, and they all give the same result.\n\nIn this specific problem, \\( a = 5 \\), \\( d = 3 \\), \\( n = 10 \\), and \\( l = 32 \\), leading to \\( S_{10} = 185 \\).\n\nI think I've verified this in every way possible.\n\nJust for kicks, let's consider what would happen if the common difference or the first term were different.\n\nFor example, if the common difference were 2 instead of 3, with the first term still 5, what would the sum of the first 10 terms be?\n\nFirst, find \\( a_{10} \\):\n\n\\[ a_{10} = 5 + (10 - 1) \\times 2 = 5 + 18 = 23 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\times (5 + 23) = 5 \\times 28 = 140 \\]\n\nOr using the other formula:\n\n\\[ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\times [2 \\times 5 + (10 - 1) \\times 2] = 5 \\times [10 + 18] = 5 \\times 28 = 140 \\]\n\nSo, it matches.\n\nSimilarly, if the first term were 4 with a common difference of 3:\n\n\\[ a_{10} = 4 + 9 \\times 3 = 4 + 27 = 31 \\]\n\n\\[ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\times (4 + 31) = 5 \\times 35 = 175 \\]\n\nOr,\n\n\\[ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\times [2 \\times 4 + 9 \\times 3] = 5 \\times [8 + 27] = 5 \\times 35 = 175 \\]\n\nAgain, consistent.\n\nThis reinforces my understanding of the formula.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, with \\( a = 5 \\), \\( d = 3 \\), \\( n = 10 \\), and \\( a_{10} = 32 \\), the sum is indeed 185.\n\nI can't think of any other way the answer could be different.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic sequence is 185.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{185} \\]"
