        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple server in GoLang that listens on a specified port and responds with the current time when it receives a GET request. Sounds straightforward. I've got some experience with Go, but let's make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a basic server. In Go, the `net/http` package is perfect for this. I can use the `http.HandleFunc` function to specify what should happen when a GET request is received.\n\nSo, I'll start by importing the necessary packages:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n```\n\nNext, I need to define a handler function that will be called when a GET request is received. This function should write the current time to the HTTP response.\n\nHere's a rough idea:\n\n```go\nfunc timeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tcurrentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123)\n\tfmt.Fprintf(w, \"Current time: %s\", currentTime)\n}\n```\n\nThen, I need to register this handler for GET requests. I can use `http.HandleFunc` for that:\n\n```go\nhttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", timeHandler)\n```\n\nAfter that, I need to specify the port on which the server should listen. The port should be configurable, so maybe I can take it as a command-line argument.\n\nLet me think about how to handle the port. I can use the `flag` package to parse command-line flags.\n\nFirst, import the `flag` package:\n\n```go\nimport \"flag\"\n```\n\nThen, define a variable to hold the port:\n\n```go\nvar port = flag.Int(\"port\", 8080, \"the port to listen on\")\n```\n\nThis sets the default port to 8080, but it can be overridden via the command line.\n\nNow, in the `main` function, I need to parse the flags and start the server.\n\nPutting it all together, here's what I have so far:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tflag.Parse()\n\tport := *port\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Starting server on port %d\\n\", port)\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", timeHandler)\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", port), nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error starting server:\", err)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc timeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tcurrentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123)\n\tfmt.Fprintf(w, \"Current time: %s\", currentTime)\n}\n```\n\nWait a minute, I think there's a small mistake here. In the `main` function, I have `port := *port`, but `port` is already a pointer obtained from `flag.Int`. So, I should dereference it to get the actual integer value.\n\nActually, I think I need to correct that. Let me check the `flag` package documentation.\n\nLooking it up, `flag.Int` returns a pointer to an integer, so yes, I need to dereference it to get the value.\n\nBut in the code above, `port := *port` seems correct, assuming that `port` is a pointer to an int.\n\nWait, actually, in Go, when you assign a pointer to a variable, it's still a pointer. So, `port := flag.Int(\"port\", 8080, \"the port to listen on\")` makes `port` a pointer to an int. Then, `port := *port` would dereference it and assign the value to a new `port` variable.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, maybe I should use a different variable name.\n\nLet me rewrite that part:\n\n```go\nvar portPtr = flag.Int(\"port\", 8080, \"the port to listen on\")\nflag.Parse()\nport := *portPtr\nfmt.Printf(\"Starting server on port %d\\n\", port)\n```\n\nThat's clearer.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the port is not a valid HTTP port. Maybe I should add some validation for the port number.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that the user enters a valid port number.\n\nAnother thing is that `http.ListenAndServe` expects the address in the form \":port\", so `fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", port)` is correct.\n\nLet me test this in my local environment.\n\nFirst, I'll run the program without specifying the port, so it should use the default 8080.\n\nThen, I'll make a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/` and see if it returns the current time.\n\nIf that works, I'll try specifying a different port via the command line.\n\nAlright, let's write the code accordingly.\n\nOne more thing: error handling. In the current code, if there's an error starting the server, it prints the error message. That's good, but maybe I should exit the program with a non-zero status in that case.\n\nI can use `os.Exit(1)` after printing the error.\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple.\n\nAlso, I should consider if multiple requests come in at the same time. Is the handler function thread-safe?\n\nIn this case, since it's just writing the current time and there's no shared state, it should be fine.\n\nBut in general, it's good to keep that in mind.\n\nAlright, I think this should work.\n\nLet me write the final code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple server in Go that listens on a specified port and responds with the current time on a GET request, you can follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Import necessary packages**: Use `net/http` for the server functionality and `time` to get the current time.\n2. **Define a handler function**: This function will be triggered on receiving a GET request and will write the current time to the response.\n3. **Register the handler**: Use `http.HandleFunc` to register the handler for the root URL.\n4. **Parse command-line flags**: Use the `flag` package to allow specifying the port via a command-line flag.\n5. **Start the server**: Use `http.ListenAndServe` to start the server on the specified port.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Define and parse command-line flags\n\tportPtr := flag.Int(\"port\", 8080, \"the port to listen on\")\n\tflag.Parse()\n\n\t// Dereference the port pointer\n\tport := *portPtr\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Starting server on port %d\\n\", port)\n\n\t// Register the handler function for root URL\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", timeHandler)\n\n\t// Start the HTTP server\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", port), nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error starting server:\", err)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc timeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\t// Get the current time and format it\n\tcurrentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123)\n\tfmt.Fprintf(w, \"Current time: %s\", currentTime)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Handler Function**: `timeHandler` fetches the current time and formats it using `time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123)`, then writes this formatted time to the HTTP response.\n2. **Command-Line Flags**: The `flag` package is used to optionally specify the port via the command line. If no port is specified, it defaults to 8080.\n3. **Starting the Server**: The server listens on the specified port and handles incoming GET requests by calling `timeHandler`.\n\nThis simple server can be started by running the Go program, and it will respond with the current time whenever a GET request is received on the specified port."
