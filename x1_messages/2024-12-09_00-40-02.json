        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular room. It says that the length is 3 meters more than its width, and the area is 70 square meters. I need to find the dimensions, which means I need to find both the length and the width. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, area = length \u00d7 width. That's a starting point.\n\nNow, the problem gives me a relationship between the length and the width: the length is 3 meters more than the width. So, if I let the width be something, say, w meters, then the length would be w + 3 meters.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Width = w meters\n\n- Length = w + 3 meters\n\n- Area = 70 square meters\n\nUsing the area formula:\n\nlength \u00d7 width = 70\n\nSubstituting the expressions for length and width:\n\n(w + 3) \u00d7 w = 70\n\nSo, that gives me the equation:\n\nw(w + 3) = 70\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nw\u00b2 + 3w = 70\n\nNow, to solve for w, I need to set this equation to zero, right? So, I'll subtract 70 from both sides:\n\nw\u00b2 + 3w - 70 = 0\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation: w\u00b2 + 3w - 70 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for w. Quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. I'll try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -70 and add up to 3. Let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of -70:\n\n- 1 and -70\n\n- 2 and -35\n\n- 5 and -14\n\n- 7 and -10\n\nLooking for a pair that adds up to 3.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- 7 + (-10) = -3, not 3.\n\n- -7 + 10 = 3, that works.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(w - 7)(w + 10) = 0\n\nNow, setting each factor equal to zero gives me the possible solutions for w:\n\nw - 7 = 0 \u21d2 w = 7\n\nw + 10 = 0 \u21d2 w = -10\n\nBut, width can't be negative, right? So, w = 7 meters makes sense.\n\nSo, width is 7 meters.\n\nNow, length is w + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 meters.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 10 \u00d7 7 = 70 square meters, which matches the given area.\n\nAlright, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, I should consider if there are any other possible solutions. Since I got w = 7 and w = -10 from factoring, and negative width doesn't make sense in this context, so only w = 7 is valid.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the quadratic formula to solve w\u00b2 + 3w - 70 = 0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\nw = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nFor the equation w\u00b2 + 3w - 70 = 0, a = 1, b = 3, c = -70.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nw = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(3\u00b2 - 4(1)(-70))] / (2*1)\n\nw = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 280)] / 2\n\nw = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(289)] / 2\n\nsqrt(289) = 17, so:\n\nw = [-3 \u00b1 17] / 2\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\n1. w = (-3 + 17) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7\n\n2. w = (-3 - 17) / 2 = -20 / 2 = -10\n\nAgain, w = 7 is the valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the width is 7 meters, and the length is 10 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{width} = 7 \\text{ meters}, \\text{ length} = 10 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
