        "content": "So I've got this limit to evaluate: the limit as x approaches infinity of (2x^2 + 3x)/(x^2 + 1). Hmm, okay, let's see how to tackle this.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you're dealing with limits as x approaches infinity, you're basically seeing what the function does when x gets really, really large. For rational functions like this one, where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials, there's a general rule I can follow based on the degrees of the polynomials.\n\nIn this case, both the numerator and the denominator are quadratic polynomials, meaning they both have degree 2. When the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are the same, the limit as x approaches infinity is equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nSo, for f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)/(x^2 + 1), the leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1. Therefore, the limit should be 2/1, which is just 2.\n\nBut, I should probably double-check this to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother method I can use is to divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator. Since the denominator has x^2, I'll divide both the top and the bottom by x^2.\n\nSo, f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)/(x^2 + 1) becomes:\n\nNumerator: (2x^2)/(x^2) + (3x)/(x^2) = 2 + 3/x\n\nDenominator: (x^2)/(x^2) + 1/(x^2) = 1 + 1/x^2\n\nSo, f(x) = (2 + 3/x)/(1 + 1/x^2)\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, 3/x approaches 0, and 1/x^2 also approaches 0. Therefore, the function approaches 2/1, which is 2.\n\nAlright, that matches what I got earlier using the rule about the degrees and the leading coefficients.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if the degrees were different. If the degree of the numerator was higher than the denominator, the limit would approach infinity. If the degree of the numerator was lower, the limit would approach 0. But since they're the same, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nIn this case, since both degrees are 2, it's indeed 2/1 = 2.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The limit as x approaches infinity of (2x^2 + 3x)/(x^2 + 1) is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
