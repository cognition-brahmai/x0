        "content": "To calculate the probability of being dealt a pair in a game of poker when drawing two cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of possible two-card hands.\n2. Determine the number of favorable outcomes, which are the hands that contain a pair.\n3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible hands.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible two-card hands.**\n\nA standard deck has 52 cards, and we are drawing 2 cards. The number of ways to choose 2 cards out of 52 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hands} = \\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52!}{2!(52-2)!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2 \\times 1} = 1,326\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (pairs).**\n\nA pair consists of two cards of the same rank. There are 13 ranks in a deck (Ace through King), and for each rank, there are 4 cards (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).\n\nTo form a pair of a specific rank, we need to choose 2 cards out of the 4 available for that rank. The number of ways to do this is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pairs per rank} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\nSince there are 13 ranks, the total number of pair hands is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pairs} = 13 \\times 6 = 78\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability.**\n\nThe probability \\( P \\) of being dealt a pair is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible hands:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{\\text{Total pairs}}{\\text{Total hands}} = \\frac{78}{1,326}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{78 \\div 78}{1,326 \\div 78} = \\frac{1}{17}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of being dealt a pair when drawing two cards from a standard deck is \\( \\frac{1}{17} \\), which is approximately 0.0588 or 5.88%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{17}} \\]"
