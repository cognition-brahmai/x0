        "content": "Sure, here's a simple function in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `factorial(n)`, where `n` is the number you want to calculate the factorial for. For example, `factorial(5)` would return `120`.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input is a non-negative integer. If you need to handle other types of inputs or larger numbers, you might need to add additional checks or use an iterative approach."
