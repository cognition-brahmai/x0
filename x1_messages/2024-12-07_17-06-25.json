        "content": "To evaluate the line integral \u222bC (y^2 dx + x^2 dy), where C is defined by the parametric equations x = t^2 and y = t^3 for t ranging from 0 to 1, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parameterize the curve C:**\n   - Given x = t^2 and y = t^3, where t \u2208 [0, 1].\n\n2. **Compute the differentials dx and dy:**\n   - dx/dt = d(x)/dt = d(t^2)/dt = 2t dt\n   - dy/dt = d(y)/dt = d(t^3)/dt = 3t^2 dt\n\n3. **Substitute x, y, dx, and dy into the integrand:**\n   - The integrand is y^2 dx + x^2 dy.\n   - Substituting, we get: (t^3)^2 * (2t dt) + (t^2)^2 * (3t^2 dt) = t^6 * 2t dt + t^4 * 3t^2 dt = 2t^7 dt + 3t^6 dt\n\n4. **Combine like terms:**\n   - 2t^7 dt + 3t^6 dt = (2t^7 + 3t^6) dt\n\n5. **Integrate with respect to t from 0 to 1:**\n   - \u222b from 0 to 1 of (2t^7 + 3t^6) dt\n\n6. **Compute the integral:**\n   - \u222b 2t^7 dt = (2/8)t^8 = (1/4)t^8\n   - \u222b 3t^6 dt = (3/7)t^7\n   - So, the integral is (1/4)t^8 + (3/7)t^7 evaluated from 0 to 1\n\n7. **Evaluate at the limits:**\n   - At t = 1: (1/4)(1)^8 + (3/7)(1)^7 = 1/4 + 3/7\n   - At t = 0: (1/4)(0)^8 + (3/7)(0)^7 = 0\n   - Therefore, the value of the integral is 1/4 + 3/7\n\n8. **Find a common denominator and add the fractions:**\n   - 1/4 = 7/28\n   - 3/7 = 12/28\n   - So, 7/28 + 12/28 = 19/28\n\nTherefore, the value of the line integral is 19/28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{28}} \\]"
