        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere's a bag of marbles with different colors: 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green. So, total marbles in the bag are 3 + 4 + 5, which is 12 marbles.\n\nThe problem says I pick one marble, look at its color, put it back in the bag, and then pick another marble. I need to find the probability of picking a red marble followed by a blue marble.\n\nOkay, since I'm putting the marble back each time, each pick is independent. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of picking a red marble on the first pick. There are 3 red marbles out of 12 total marbles, so the probability is 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nNext, the probability of picking a blue marble on the second pick. There are 4 blue marbles out of 12 total marbles, so that's 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nSince these are independent events, I can find the combined probability by multiplying the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, probability of red first and then blue is (1/4) * (1/3) = 1/12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nTotal marbles: 12\n\nProbability of red first: 3/12 = 1/4\n\nProbability of blue second: 4/12 = 1/3\n\nMultiply them: (1/4)*(1/3) = 1/12\n\nYeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations or permutations, but since it's with replacement and order matters, the straightforward multiplication should work.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nTotal possible outcomes for two picks, with replacement, are 12 options for the first pick and 12 for the second, so 12*12=144 total possible outcomes.\n\nFavorable outcomes are picking a red first (3 options) and then a blue (4 options), so 3*4=12 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, probability is favorable divided by total, which is 12/144 = 1/12.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red marble followed by a blue marble is 1/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}} \\]"
