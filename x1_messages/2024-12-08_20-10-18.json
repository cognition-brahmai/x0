        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. I need to find the probability of drawing a red ball from the bag without replacement. Okay, no replacement means once I draw a ball, it stays out, right? But in this case, since it's just one draw, I think that part doesn't affect this particular probability.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the bag. Let's add them up: 5 red + 3 blue + 2 green equals 10 balls in total. So, there are 10 balls altogether.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing a red ball, and the total possible outcomes are all the balls in the bag.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls, which is 5. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 10.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of drawing a red ball is P(red) = number of red balls / total number of balls = 5/10.\n\nSimplifying that fraction, 5 divided by 10 is 0.5, or in fraction form, it's 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2 or 0.5, which is the same as 50%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. There are 5 red balls out of 10 total balls. Yes, that should be correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about the proportions. Red balls make up half of the total balls in the bag, so it makes sense that the probability of drawing a red ball is 50%.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there was replacement or multiple draws, but since it's a single draw without replacement, this should be straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the probability of drawing a red ball is 1/2 or 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
