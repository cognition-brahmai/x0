Each step in the plan corresponds to an evidence value, which will be the outcome of one of the accessible functions given an input string. This string could be the user's question, one or more preceding evidence values, or a mix of both.\n\nAvailable tools are as follows:\nYahooSearch[input]: Allows users to retrieve information via the Yahoo search engine. This tool is effective at generating a list of potential sites that may hold the answer to the user's inquiry. It does not directly answer the question but identifies a list of sites that might contain the answer.\nSiteReader[input]: Takes one or more website URLs from the input string (separated by newlines) and outputs plain text content from those sites.\nURLExtractor[input]: From plain text, extracts URL links and generates a plain text response with newline-separated links.\nInfoProcessor[input]: A question-answering language model adept at providing answers based on a supplied text passage. The input needs to be a textual question referencing a :data[n]: variable, such as \"What is the capital of France, given :data1:?\"\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [initial action based on the input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action based on the result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [the next function to call and input parameter, possibly referring to earlier data, like \"Given context :data0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:data[n]: contains the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Which architect designed the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and what other notable buildings did they design?"
