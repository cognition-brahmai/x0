        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 6 green balls. So, in total, there are 5 + 4 + 6 = 15 balls in the box.\n\nThe question is about finding the probability of drawing two red balls and one blue ball from the box without replacement. Okay, so without replacement means once you draw a ball, it stays out, and you don't put it back.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of ways to draw three balls from the box. Since the order doesn't matter here (we're just interested in the combination of colors, not the sequence), I should use combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 15 is calculated using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{15!}{3!(15-3)!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 455\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 455 different ways to draw 3 balls from the box.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing two red balls and one blue ball.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to choose two red balls from the 5 available red balls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose 2 red balls} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, the number of ways to choose one blue ball from the 4 available blue balls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose 1 blue ball} = \\binom{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable ways is the product of these two:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = 10 \\times 4 = 40\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the probability, I divide the number of favorable ways by the total number of ways:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Favorable ways}}{\\text{Total ways}} = \\frac{40}{455}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40 \\div 5}{455 \\div 5} = \\frac{8}{91}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red balls and one blue ball without replacement is \\(\\frac{8}{91}\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability step by step, considering that the draws are without replacement.\n\nFirst draw: Probability of drawing a red ball. There are 5 red balls out of 15 total balls.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Red}_1) = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSecond draw: Probability of drawing another red ball, given that one red has already been drawn. Now, there are 4 red balls left out of 14 total balls.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Red}_2 | \\text{Red}_1) = \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{2}{7}\n\\]\n\nThird draw: Probability of drawing a blue ball, given that two red balls have already been drawn. Now, there are 4 blue balls out of 13 total balls left.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Blue}_3 | \\text{Red}_1 \\text{ and } \\text{Red}_2) = \\frac{4}{13}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (Red, Red, Blue) is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{RRB}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{7} \\times \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{8}{273}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the order in which we draw the balls can vary. We could have RRB, RBR, or BRR. All these sequences are favorable.\n\nEach of these sequences will have the same probability because the probabilities for each draw, given the previous draws, are the same in each sequence.\n\nSo, there are 3 different sequences that result in two reds and one blue.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{2 Red and 1 Blue}) = 3 \\times \\frac{8}{273} = \\frac{24}{273} = \\frac{8}{91}\n\\]\n\nOkay, this matches the earlier result. So, the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{8}{91}\\).\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this, just to be thorough.\n\nAnother approach could be to use permutations instead of combinations. But since the order doesn't matter in this problem, using combinations is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of hypergeometric distribution, which deals with sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\times \\binom{N - K}{n - k}}{\\binom{N}{n}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(N\\) is the population size (15 balls).\n\n- \\(K\\) is the number of success states in the population (5 red balls).\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of draws (3 balls).\n\n- \\(k\\) is the number of observed successes (2 red balls).\n\nWait, but in this problem, we have two conditions: 2 red and 1 blue. So, maybe I need to adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as first choosing 2 red balls and then 1 blue ball, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball in any order.\n\nBut I think the first method using combinations is correct and sufficient.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the total probability using the step-by-step approach for all possible sequences:\n\n1. RRB: \\(\\frac{5}{15} \\times \\frac{4}{14} \\times \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{8}{273}\\)\n\n2. RBR: \\(\\frac{5}{15} \\times \\frac{4}{14} \\times \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{8}{273}\\)\n\n3. BRR: \\(\\frac{4}{15} \\times \\frac{5}{14} \\times \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{8}{273}\\)\n\nAdding these up: \\(\\frac{8}{273} + \\frac{8}{273} + \\frac{8}{273} = \\frac{24}{273} = \\frac{8}{91}\\)\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the probability is \\(\\frac{8}{91}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{91}} \\]"
