        "content": "So, the problem is that a person reads 20 pages in 30 minutes, and we need to find out how many pages they can read in 2 hours. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between time and the number of pages read. It seems like the reading speed is constant, so I can assume that the number of pages read is directly proportional to the time spent reading.\n\nGiven that, I can set up a ratio or use the concept of rates to solve this problem. Let's consider the reading rate, which is pages per minute or pages per hour.\n\nLet me start by finding the reading rate in pages per minute. If the person reads 20 pages in 30 minutes, then the rate is 20 pages / 30 minutes. Simplifying that, it's 2/3 pages per minute.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many pages they can read in 2 hours. But first, I should convert 2 hours into minutes because my reading rate is in pages per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes.\n\nNow, if the reading rate is 2/3 pages per minute, then in 120 minutes, the number of pages read would be (2/3) pages/minute * 120 minutes.\n\nLet me calculate that: (2/3)*120 = (2*120)/3 = 240/3 = 80 pages.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of proportions. If 30 minutes corresponds to 20 pages, then 120 minutes would correspond to x pages. So, I can set up the proportion: 30/20 = 120/x.\n\nWait, is that correct? Actually, that should be 30 minutes is to 20 pages as 120 minutes is to x pages. So, 30/20 = 120/x.\n\nBut actually, in proportions, when comparing rates, it's better to keep the same units in numerator and denominator. So, perhaps it's better to write it as pages over minutes.\n\nSo, 20 pages / 30 minutes = x pages / 120 minutes.\n\nNow, cross-multiplying: 20*120 = 30*x => 2400 = 30x => x = 2400 / 30 = 80 pages.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using unit rates or something like that.\n\nLet me try finding the number of pages per hour.\n\nFirst, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, in half an hour, the person reads 20 pages. Therefore, in one hour, they would read twice that amount, because there are two half-hours in an hour.\n\nSo, 20 pages * 2 = 40 pages per hour.\n\nNow, in 2 hours, they would read 40 pages/hour * 2 hours = 80 pages.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using the concept of time ratios.\n\nThe time ratio is 30 minutes to 120 minutes, which simplifies to 1:4.\n\nSo, if in 30 minutes they read 20 pages, then in 4 times that time, they should read 4 times the number of pages.\n\nSo, 20 pages * 4 = 80 pages.\n\nOnce more, the same result.\n\nIs there any other method I can use to confirm this?\n\nPerhaps graphing the relationship, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of speed and distance, where speed is pages per unit time, and distance is the total pages read.\n\nIn physics, distance = speed * time.\n\nSimilarly, pages = reading rate * time.\n\nWe already calculated the reading rate as 2/3 pages per minute, and time is 120 minutes, so pages = (2/3)*120 = 80.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 80 pages.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there's any possibility of misunderstanding the problem.\n\nFor example, maybe the reading speed isn't constant, or perhaps there are constraints on the total number of pages in the book.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems like the reading speed is constant, and there's no limitation on the total pages beyond what's asked.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 80 pages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
