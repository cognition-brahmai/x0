The phrase is part of a longer verse from the Roman poet Horace: \"carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero,\" which translates to \"seize the day, putting as little trust as possible in the future.\" This philosophy encourages individuals to make the most of the present moment rather than relying on uncertain future events."
