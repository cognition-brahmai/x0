        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. We have a group of 20 people, out of which 12 have brown eyes and 8 have blue eyes. The question is, if we randomly select two people from this group, what's the probability that both have blue eyes?\n\nOkay, probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step. First, I need to recall the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are the pairs where both people have blue eyes, and the total number of possible outcomes is all possible pairs of people we can select from the group.\n\nSo, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. We're selecting 2 people out of 20, and the order doesn't matter because selecting person A and then person B is the same as selecting person B and then person A. Therefore, we should use combinations here, not permutations.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20 - 2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 18! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 18!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 190 possible pairs of people.\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the pairs where both people have blue eyes. There are 8 people with blue eyes, and we need to choose 2 of them.\n\nAgain, using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 28 pairs where both people have blue eyes.\n\nNow, to find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{28}{190}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{28 \\div 2}{190 \\div 2} = \\frac{14}{95}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability that both selected people have blue eyes is \\( \\frac{14}{95} \\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to calculate probability is to use the formula for independent events, but in this case, the selections are dependent because the probability changes after the first selection.\n\nLet's try that approach. The probability that the first person selected has blue eyes is the number of blue-eyed people divided by the total number of people:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{First blue}) = \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nNow, given that the first person selected has blue eyes, there are now 7 blue-eyed people left and a total of 19 people left to choose from. So, the probability that the second person also has blue eyes is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Second blue} | \\text{First blue}) = \\frac{7}{19}\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen, we multiply these probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Both blue}) = P(\\text{First blue}) \\times P(\\text{Second blue} | \\text{First blue}) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{19} = \\frac{14}{95}\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier result. So, the probability is indeed \\( \\frac{14}{95} \\).\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Suppose I wanted to use permutations instead of combinations. Would I get the same answer?\n\nIf I use permutations, the total number of ways to select 2 people out of 20, considering order, would be:\n\n\\[\nP(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{(20 - 2)!} = 20 \\times 19 = 380\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to select 2 blue-eyed people, considering order, would be:\n\n\\[\nP(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{(8 - 2)!} = 8 \\times 7 = 56\n\\]\n\nThen, the probability would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{56}{380} = \\frac{28}{190} = \\frac{14}{95}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same result. So, regardless of whether I use combinations or permutations, I end up with the same probability.\n\nI think that's reassuring. It confirms that my initial approach was correct.\n\nIs there any other aspect to this problem that I should consider? For example, what if the selections were made with replacement, meaning that after selecting the first person, they are put back into the pool before selecting the second person. How would that affect the probability?\n\nIn that case, the total number of possible outcomes would be \\( 20 \\times 20 = 400 \\), since each selection is independent.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes would be \\( 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\), because each time we select a blue-eyed person, there are still 8 blue-eyed people to choose from.\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{64}{400} = \\frac{16}{100} = \\frac{4}{25}\n\\]\n\nBut in our original problem, selections are made without replacement, meaning that once someone is selected, they can't be selected again. That's why the total number of possible outcomes is 190, not 400, and the probability is \\( \\frac{14}{95} \\), which is approximately 0.147, or 14.7%, compared to 16% if selections were with replacement.\n\nSo, the method of selection affects the probability.\n\nBut again, in this problem, it's specified that selections are made without replacement, so my original answer of \\( \\frac{14}{95} \\) is correct.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe using probabilities of complementary events or something like that.\n\nWait, but in this case, the complementary event would be that not both people have blue eyes, which includes scenarios where one has blue eyes and the other has brown eyes, or both have brown eyes. But since the question specifically asks for the probability that both have blue eyes, it's more straightforward to calculate it directly as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of selecting two blue-eyed people using the concept of conditional probability.\n\nThe conditional probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A)\n\\]\n\nWhich is exactly what I used earlier: the probability that the first person has blue eyes and the second person has blue eyes given that the first one has blue eyes.\n\nAnd that gave me \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{19} = \\frac{14}{95} \\), which matches my previous result.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I've thoroughly analyzed this problem and confirmed the answer using different approaches. The probability that both selected people have blue eyes is \\( \\frac{14}{95} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}} \\]"
