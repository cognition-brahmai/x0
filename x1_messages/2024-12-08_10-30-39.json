More like the magician who's about to be outshined. Again.\n\n**Elijah:** Oh, don't remind me of last year's competition. A simple misdirection trick, and you claim victory? Pathetic.\n\n**Marcus:** Misdirection? Please, Elijah. It was pure genius. You just couldn't see past your own ego.\n\n**Elijah:** Ego? Is that what you call it when someone dedicates their life to perfecting the art of magic? I've spent years mastering illusions, and you think a cheap trick can surpass that?\n\n**Marcus:** Illusions are for amateurs. Real magic is about connecting with the audience, making them believe in the impossible. That's what I do, and that's why they remember me.\n\n**Elijah:** Belief is for fools. Magic is about skill, precision, and execution. Not some cheap emotional appeal.\n\n**Marcus:** Emotional appeal? You call it cheap, but it's what makes magic memorable. People don't come to see tricks; they come to experience wonder.\n\n**Elijah:** Wonder can be achieved through skill alone. Take my disappearing act, for instance. Flawless execution, no emotions needed.\n\n**Marcus:** Your disappearing act? More like your career disappearing after I beat you last time. (Laughs)\n\n**Elijah:** That was a fluke, and you know it. This time, it's different. I've been practicing non-stop, perfecting my techniques.\n\n**Marcus:** Oh, I've heard this speech before. But let's be real, Elijah. You're just desperate to reclaim your title.\n\n**Elijah:** Desperate? Hardly. I'm driven by a passion for magic that you could never understand. You see it as a game, but for me, it's a lifelong commitment.\n\n**Marcus:** A commitment to losing? Maybe you should consider retiring while you still have some dignity left.\n\n**Elijah:** (Grinding teeth) You'll regret those words when I step on that stage and leave you in the dust.\n\n**Marcus:** (Confidently) Bring it on, Elijah. I'm ready to watch you fail again.\n\n**Elijah:** This isn't just about winning, Marcus. It's about proving who the true magician is. And I intend to show everyone what real magic looks like.\n\n**Marcus:** Prove all you want, but in the end, it's the audience who decides. And they've already chosen their favorite.\n\n**Elijah:** We'll see about that. Mark my words, Marcus. This time, it's my turn to shine.\n\n**Marcus:** (Smirking) I can't wait to see you try.\n\n**Elijah:** (Determined) Trust me, you won't be laughing when I leave you in the shadow of my greatness.\n\n**Marcus:** (Undaunted) Bring on the shadows, Elijah. I thrive in the light.\n\n**Elijah:** Light or dark, it makes no difference. Magic is magic, and I am its master.\n\n**Marcus:** Only in your delusional mind, Elijah. Now, shall we proceed to the duel? I'm eager to see what tricks you've got up your sleeve.\n\n**Elijah:** (Taking a deep breath) Let's do this. But remember, Marcus, one day, you'll look back and realize that you were overshadowed by a true talent.\n\n**Marcus:** (Laughing) I'll look back and remember that I defeated you yet again. See you on stage, Elijah.\n\n**Elijah:** (Nodding resolutely) See you there.\n\n**[Both magicians exit, each confident in their own abilities, setting the stage for an epic confrontation.]**"
