        "content": "Let's see. There are 120,000 registered voters in the city, and 60% of them vote in the election. So first, I need to find out how many people actually voted.\n\nTo find 60% of 120,000, I can calculate:\n\nVotes cast = 120,000 * 0.60 = 72,000 votes.\n\nNow, the candidate needs at least 50% plus one vote of those who voted to win. So, to find out what that number is, I'll calculate 50% of the votes cast and then add one.\n\n50% of 72,000 is:\n\n0.50 * 72,000 = 36,000 votes.\n\nSo, the candidate needs 36,000 + 1 = 36,001 votes to win.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of the total votes that this represents. So, I need to find what percentage 36,001 is of the total votes cast, which is 72,000.\n\nTo find the percentage, I use the formula:\n\n( Part / Whole ) * 100 = Percentage\n\nSo,\n\n(36,001 / 72,000) * 100 = ?\n\nFirst, divide 36,001 by 72,000:\n\n36,001 \u00f7 72,000 = 0.5000138889...\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.5000138889 * 100 = 50.00138889...\n\nSo, the candidate needs approximately 50.0014% of the total votes to win.\n\nBut since the question asks for the percentage of the total votes needed to win, and considering that the candidate needs more than 50%, the exact percentage is 50% plus one-vote equivalent in percentage.\n\nAlternatively, since 36,001 votes are needed out of 72,000, and 36,000 would be exactly 50%, adding one more vote makes it slightly over 50%.\n\nSo, the candidate needs more than 50% of the votes to win, specifically 50% plus one vote, which in this case is 36,001 votes, representing approximately 50.0014% of the total votes cast.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50.0014\\%} \\]"
