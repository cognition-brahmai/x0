I need to find a_6.\n\nOkay, so recursive sequences work by using previous terms to find new ones. Here, each term depends on the two preceding terms. Let's start by writing down what I know:\n\na_1 = 3\n\na_2 = 5\n\nNow, to find a_3, I use the formula with n = 1:\n\na_(1+2) = a_(1+1) - a_1\n\nSo, a_3 = a_2 - a_1 = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nGreat, a_3 is 2.\n\nNext, for a_4, I set n = 2:\n\na_(2+2) = a_(2+1) - a_2\n\nSo, a_4 = a_3 - a_2 = 2 - 5 = -3\n\nInteresting, a_4 is -3.\n\nNow, a_5 with n = 3:\n\na_(3+2) = a_(3+1) - a_3\n\nSo, a_5 = a_4 - a_3 = -3 - 2 = -5\n\nA_5 is -5.\n\nFinally, a_6 with n = 4:\n\na_(4+2) = a_(4+1) - a_4\n\nSo, a_6 = a_5 - a_4 = -5 - (-3) = -5 + 3 = -2\n\nTherefore, a_6 is -2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've applied the formula correctly at each step.\n\nStarting with a_1 = 3 and a_2 = 5.\n\nThen a_3 = a_2 - a_1 = 5 - 3 = 2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = a_3 - a_2 = 2 - 5 = -3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = a_4 - a_3 = -3 - 2 = -5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = a_5 - a_4 = -5 - (-3) = -5 + 3 = -2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems correct. So, the value of a_6 is -2.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or see if the sequence repeats.\n\nLet's compute a_7 to see:\n\na_7 = a_6 - a_5 = -2 - (-5) = -2 + 5 = 3\n\nHmm, a_7 is 3, which is the same as a_1.\n\nLet's compute a_8:\n\na_8 = a_7 - a_6 = 3 - (-2) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nA_8 is 5, which is the same as a_2.\n\nSo, it seems like the sequence repeats every 6 terms.\n\nLet's list out the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 3\n\na_2 = 5\n\na_3 = 2\n\na_4 = -3\n\na_5 = -5\n\na_6 = -2\n\na_7 = 3\n\na_8 = 5\n\nYes, it's repeating every 6 terms: 3, 5, 2, -3, -5, -2, 3, 5, 2, -3, -5, -2, and so on.\n\nSo, a_6 is -2, and the sequence has a period of 6.\n\nI think that's all I need to conclude that a_6 is indeed -2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-2} \\]"
