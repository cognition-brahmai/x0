        "content": "Let's see. So, there are three friends sharing a pizza that has 8 slices, and they each eat their equal shares but still have some slices left. I need to figure out how many slices are left.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to divide 8 slices among 3 friends equally. Since 8 divided by 3 doesn't give a whole number, there will be some slices left over.\n\nLet me do the division: 8 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 2. That means each friend gets 2 slices, and there are 2 slices left over.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says they each eat their equal shares but still have some slices left. So, does that mean they each get an equal share, eat it, and then there are slices remaining that no one ate?\n\nIf each friend gets 2 slices and eats them, that's 2 slices per friend times 3 friends, which is 6 slices eaten. And since the pizza had 8 slices, 8 minus 6 equals 2 slices left.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2 slices left.\n\nBut let me double-check. If they each get 2 slices and eat them, that's 6 slices eaten, and 8 minus 6 is indeed 2.\n\nAlternatively, if they were to share the pizza equally including the leftover slices, but the problem says they each eat their equal shares but still have some slices left. It seems like the leftover slices are not being eaten by anyone.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2 slices left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
