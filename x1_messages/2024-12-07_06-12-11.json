Here are five Digimon characters with their basic information in YAML format:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Agumon\n  type: Fresh\n  attribute: Vaccine\n  level: 1\n\n- name: Gabumon\n  type: Fresh\n  attribute: Vaccine\n  level: 1\n\n- name: Tentomon\n  type: Fresh\n  attribute: Data\n  level: 1\n\n- name: Palmon\n  type: Fresh\n  attribute: Vaccine\n  level: 1\n\n- name: Biyomon\n  type: Fresh\n  attribute: Vaccine\n  level: 1\n```\n\nI've included some of the original Digimon from the first season of the anime. Each has the type \"Fresh,\" which is the starting stage before they digivolve into higher forms. Their attributes are either Vaccine or Data, which are common for Fresh-level Digimon. The level is set to 1, indicating their initial stage in the Digimon hierarchy."
