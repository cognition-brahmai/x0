        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a hospital with 100 patients in critical care, and they need different levels of oxygen therapy. We need to figure out how many oxygen cylinders the hospital should have each day to meet this demand, plus a safety margin.\n\nFirst, let's break down the patients based on their oxygen therapy needs:\n\n- 60% of the patients need high-flow oxygen therapy at 15 liters per minute.\n\n- 30% need medium-flow at 10 liters per minute.\n\n- 10% need low-flow at 5 liters per minute.\n\nGiven that there are 100 patients, we can calculate the number of patients in each category:\n\nHigh-flow patients: 60% of 100 = 0.60 * 100 = 60 patients\n\nMedium-flow patients: 30% of 100 = 0.30 * 100 = 30 patients\n\nLow-flow patients: 10% of 100 = 0.10 * 100 = 10 patients\n\nNow, we need to find out the total oxygen consumption per minute for each group and then sum them up to get the total oxygen required per minute for all patients.\n\nFor high-flow patients:\n\n60 patients * 15 liters per minute = 900 liters per minute\n\nFor medium-flow patients:\n\n30 patients * 10 liters per minute = 300 liters per minute\n\nFor low-flow patients:\n\n10 patients * 5 liters per minute = 50 liters per minute\n\nTotal oxygen required per minute: 900 + 300 + 50 = 1250 liters per minute\n\nNext, we need to find out the total oxygen required per day. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, so:\n\nTotal minutes in a day: 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 minutes/day\n\nTotal oxygen required per day: 1250 liters/minute * 1440 minutes/day = 1,800,000 liters/day\n\nNow, oxygen is supplied in cylinders, each containing 6,000 liters. So, the number of cylinders needed per day without considering the safety margin is:\n\n1,800,000 liters/day \u00f7 6,000 liters/cylinder = 300 cylinders/day\n\nBut we need to include a safety margin of 20% to account for any unexpected increases in demand or other variables. To calculate the total cylinders needed including the safety margin:\n\nSafety margin: 20% of 300 cylinders = 0.20 * 300 = 60 cylinders\n\nTotal cylinders needed per day: 300 + 60 = 360 cylinders\n\nSo, the hospital needs 360 cylinders per day to meet the oxygen supply requirements for the critical care units, including a 20% safety margin.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the number of patients in each category:\n\n- High-flow: 60 patients\n\n- Medium-flow: 30 patients\n\n- Low-flow: 10 patients\n\nThat adds up to 100 patients, which is correct.\n\nNow, oxygen consumption per minute:\n\n- High-flow: 60 * 15 = 900 liters/minute\n\n- Medium-flow: 30 * 10 = 300 liters/minute\n\n- Low-flow: 10 * 5 = 50 liters/minute\n\nTotal: 900 + 300 + 50 = 1250 liters/minute\n\nMinutes in a day: 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes/day\n\nTotal oxygen per day: 1250 * 1440 = 1,800,000 liters/day\n\nCylinders needed without margin: 1,800,000 \u00f7 6,000 = 300 cylinders\n\nSafety margin: 20% of 300 = 60 cylinders\n\nTotal cylinders needed: 300 + 60 = 360 cylinders\n\nEverything seems to check out. I think 360 cylinders per day is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
