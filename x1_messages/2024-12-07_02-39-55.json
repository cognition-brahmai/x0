        "content": "Alright, I need to figure out what the main diet of the African elephant is and where they can be found in the wild. I've got these tools to help me: a SearchEngine, a TextParser, a MapLocator, and a QA_Tool. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I probably need to find some basic information about African elephants. I can use the SearchEngine to look that up. So, I'll search for \"African elephant diet and habitat.\"\n\nPlan: Search for \"African elephant diet and habitat\"\n#E1 = SearchEngine[\"African elephant diet and habitat\"]\n\nOkay, #E1 should give me a bunch of search results. Now, I need to go through these results to find reliable information. Maybe I can pick a few top results and use the TextParser to extract key information from them.\n\nPlan: Use TextParser on the top search results from #E1\n#E2 = TextParser[#E1]\n\nWith #E2, I should have some extracted information about the diet and habitat of African elephants. Now, I need to make sure that the information is accurate and consistent across different sources. Maybe I can compare the information from a few different sources.\n\nAlternatively, if the TextParser gives me unclear or conflicting information, I might need to look for more specific sources. For example, I could search for \"African elephant diet\" and \"African elephant habitat\" separately to get more focused results.\n\nPlan: If necessary, search for \"African elephant diet\" and \"African elephant habitat\" separately\n#E3 = SearchEngine[\"African elephant diet\"]\n#E4 = SearchEngine[\"African elephant habitat\"]\n\nThen, use the TextParser on these new search results to get more detailed information.\n\nPlan: Use TextParser on #E3 and #E4\n#E5 = TextParser[#E3]\n#E6 = TextParser[#E4]\n\nNow, I should have a good amount of information about both the diet and the habitat of African elephants. I need to summarize this information to answer the question.\n\nMaybe I can use the QA_Tool to help me formulate a concise answer based on the information I've gathered.\n\nPlan: Use QA_Tool to summarize the diet and habitat based on #E2, #E5, and #E6\n#E7 = QA_Tool[\"What is the main diet of the African elephant and where can they be found in the wild?\", context: #E2, #E5, #E6]\n\nThis should give me a straightforward answer to the question. However, I also need to make sure that the locations mentioned are accurate. Perhaps I can use the MapLocator tool to verify where African elephants can be found in the wild.\n\nPlan: Use MapLocator to find where African elephants live in the wild\n#E8 = MapLocator[\"African elephant habitat\"]\n\n#E8 should show me a map with the regions where African elephants are found. This will help me confirm the information I got from the previous steps.\n\nFinally, I can\u6574\u5408 all this information to give a comprehensive answer to the user's question.\n\nPlan: Combine the information from #E7 and #E8 to provide the final answer\n#E9 = QA_Tool[\"Based on #E7 and #E8, what is the main diet of the African elephant and where can they be found in the wild?\"]\n\nFinal Answer: #E9"
