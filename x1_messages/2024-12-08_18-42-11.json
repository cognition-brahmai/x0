        "content": "So there are 600 students in total, and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. I need to find out how many boys and how many girls there are. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I understand that a ratio of 3:2 means that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. So, the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, these 5 parts represent the total number of students, which is 600. So, each part must represent 600 divided by 5. Let me calculate that:\n\n600 \u00f7 5 = 120.\n\nSo, each part is 120 students.\n\nNow, since there are 3 parts for boys, the number of boys would be 3 times 120, and the number of girls would be 2 times 120.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nBoys: 3 \u00d7 120 = 360.\n\nGirls: 2 \u00d7 120 = 240.\n\nSo, there are 360 boys and 240 girls in the school.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let's add them up to see if they total 600.\n\n360 + 240 = 600. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlso, let's check the ratio:\n\nBoys:Girls = 360:240.\n\nIf I simplify that ratio by dividing both numbers by 120, I get 3:2, which matches the given ratio.\n\nSo, my answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360 \\text{ boys and } 240 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
