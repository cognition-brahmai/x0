        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a C# class for a bank account. It should have methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and check the current balance. I need to make sure that it handles errors properly, like when someone tries to withdraw more money than what's in the account or if someone enters invalid amounts.\n\nFirst, I'll start by creating a class called BankAccount. I'll need to store the current balance, so I'll have a private field for that. Probably, I'll use a decimal type for the balance to handle money accurately.\n\nNow, for the constructor. I should probably allow the initial balance to be set when the account is created, but also handle the case where no initial balance is provided. Maybe set it to zero by default.\n\nNext, the Deposit method. This should take an amount as a parameter and add it to the balance. I need to make sure that the amount is positive; otherwise, it doesn't make sense to deposit a negative amount. So, I'll add a check for that and throw an exception if the amount is negative.\n\nSimilarly, the Withdraw method should take an amount and subtract it from the balance. Here, I need to check two things: first, that the amount is positive, and second, that the account has sufficient funds to cover the withdrawal. If either of these checks fails, I should throw an appropriate exception.\n\nThe CheckBalance method can simply return the current balance.\n\nFor error handling, I'll use exceptions. For invalid inputs, like negative amounts, I can throw ArgumentException. For insufficient funds, I can throw InvalidOperationException or create a custom exception like InsufficientFundsException.\n\nAlso, I should consider making the balance field readonly or encapsulated properly to prevent direct modification from outside the class.\n\nLet me think about thread safety. If multiple threads are accessing the same BankAccount instance, there could be race conditions. For example, two deposits happening at the same time might overwrite each other. To prevent this, I can use locking or make the methods thread-safe.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that the BankAccount instance is not shared between threads and won't handle multithreading issues for now.\n\nNow, for unit tests. I need to test all possible scenarios:\n\n- Creating an account with an initial balance.\n\n- Depositing positive amounts.\n\n- Withdrawing positive amounts without going below zero.\n\n- Handling negative deposits and withdrawals by throwing exceptions.\n\n- Handling withdrawals that exceed the balance by throwing exceptions.\n\nI'll use NUnit or MSTest for writing the unit tests. I'll set up test cases for each of these scenarios.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the class:\n\npublic class BankAccount\n\n{\n\nprivate decimal balance;\n\npublic BankAccount(decimal initialBalance = 0.0m)\n\n{\n\nif (initialBalance < 0)\n\n{\n\nthrow new ArgumentException(\"Initial balance cannot be negative.\");\n\n}\n\nbalance = initialBalance;\n\n}\n\npublic void Deposit(decimal amount)\n\n{\n\nif (amount < 0)\n\n{\n\nthrow new ArgumentException(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\");\n\n}\n\nbalance += amount;\n\n}\n\npublic void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n\n{\n\nif (amount < 0)\n\n{\n\nthrow new ArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\");\n\n}\n\nif (balance < amount)\n\n{\n\nthrow new InvalidOperationException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n}\n\nbalance -= amount;\n\n}\n\npublic decimal CheckBalance()\n\n{\n\nreturn balance;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nFor the unit tests, I'll create a test class BankAccountTests and write methods for each test case.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Test_CreateAccountWithPositiveBalance()\n\n- Test_DepositPositiveAmount()\n\n- Test-WithdrawalWithinBalance()\n\n- Test_DepositNegativeAmount_ThrowsException()\n\n- Test-WithdrawalExceedingBalance_ThrowsException()\n\nI need to make sure that the exceptions are thrown with the correct messages and that the balance is updated correctly in the successful cases.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like depositing or withdrawing zero amount, or creating an account with zero initial balance.\n\nAlright, I think this is a good starting point. Now, I'll proceed to implement the class and the unit tests accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to design a `BankAccount` class in C# that allows users to deposit funds, withdraw funds, and check their balance. The class must handle errors gracefully, such as preventing withdrawals when there are insufficient funds or rejecting invalid inputs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Class Design**:\n   - Use a private field to store the balance.\n   - Provide a constructor to initialize the account with an optional initial balance.\n   - Implement methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n   - Ensure that deposit and withdrawal amounts are positive and that withdrawals do not exceed the balance.\n\n2. **Error Handling**:\n   - Throw `ArgumentException` for invalid amounts (negative or zero).\n   - Throw `InvalidOperationException` for insufficient funds.\n\n3. **Unit Tests**:\n   - Verify correct behavior for valid operations.\n   - Confirm that exceptions are thrown for invalid operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class BankAccount\n{\n    private decimal balance;\n\n    public BankAccount(decimal initialBalance = 0.0m)\n    {\n        if (initialBalance < 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Initial balance cannot be negative.\");\n        }\n        balance = initialBalance;\n    }\n\n    public void Deposit(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount <= 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n        }\n        balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount <= 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n        }\n        if (balance < amount)\n        {\n            throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n        }\n        balance -= amount;\n    }\n\n    public decimal CheckBalance()\n    {\n        return balance;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Unit Tests\n\nTo verify the functionality, we can write unit tests using NUnit:\n\n```csharp\nusing NUnit.Framework;\nusing System;\n\n[TestFixture]\npublic class BankAccountTests\n{\n    [Test]\n    public void Test_CreateAccountWithPositiveBalance()\n    {\n        var account = new BankAccount(100.0m);\n        Assert.AreEqual(100.0m, account.CheckBalance());\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Test_CreateAccountWithZeroBalance()\n    {\n        var account = new BankAccount(0.0m);\n        Assert.AreEqual(0.0m, account.CheckBalance());\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Test_DepositPositiveAmount()\n    {\n        var account = new BankAccount(100.0m);\n        account.Deposit(50.0m);\n        Assert.AreEqual(150.0m, account.CheckBalance());\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Test-WithdrawalWithinBalance()\n    {\n        var account = new BankAccount(100.0m);\n        account.Withdraw(50.0m);\n        Assert.AreEqual(50.0m, account.CheckBalance());\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Test_DepositNegativeAmount_ThrowsException()\n    {\n        var account = new BankAccount(100.0m);\n        Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Deposit(-50.0m));\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Test-WithdrawalExceedingBalance_ThrowsException()\n    {\n        var account = new BankAccount(100.0m);\n        Assert.Throws<InvalidOperationException>(() => account.Withdraw(150.0m));\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Test-WithdrawalZeroAmount_ThrowsException()\n    {\n        var account = new BankAccount(100.0m);\n        Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Withdraw(0.0m));\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Test_DepositZeroAmount_ThrowsException()\n    {\n        var account = new BankAccount(100.0m);\n        Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Deposit(0.0m));\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Test_CreateAccountWithNegativeBalance_ThrowsException()\n    {\n        Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => new BankAccount(-100.0m));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **BankAccount Class**:\n  - Initializes with an optional non-negative balance.\n  - Deposits and withdraws funds with appropriate validations.\n  - Provides a method to check the current balance.\n\n- **Unit Tests**:\n  - Ensure the account is created correctly with various initial balances.\n  - Validate deposit and withdrawal operations with valid and invalid amounts.\n  - Confirm that exceptions are thrown for invalid operations, maintaining the integrity of the account balance."
