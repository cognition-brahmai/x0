        "content": "Let's tackle this age problem step by step. So, we have a father and his son, and we're trying to figure out their current ages based on the information given.\n\nFirst, it says that the father's age is currently three times his son's age. Let's denote the son's current age as S and the father's current age as F. So, according to the first piece of information:\n\nF = 3S\n\nThat makes sense. Now, the second part says that in 10 years, the father will be twice as old as his son. In 10 years, the son's age will be S + 10, and the father's age will be F + 10. According to the problem:\n\nF + 10 = 2(S + 10)\n\nOkay, so now we have two equations:\n\n1) F = 3S\n\n2) F + 10 = 2(S + 10)\n\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S. Let's do that:\n\n3S + 10 = 2(S + 10)\n\nNow, let's solve for S:\n\n3S + 10 = 2S + 20\n\nSubtract 2S from both sides:\n\n3S - 2S + 10 = 20\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nS + 10 = 20\n\nNow, subtract 10 from both sides:\n\nS = 10\n\nSo, the son is currently 10 years old. Now, to find the father's age, we can plug S back into the first equation:\n\nF = 3S = 3 * 10 = 30\n\nTherefore, the father is currently 30 years old, and the son is 10 years old.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. In 10 years, the father will be 30 + 10 = 40, and the son will be 10 + 10 = 20. According to the problem, in 10 years, the father should be twice as old as the son. Is 40 twice 20? Yes, it is. So, our solution checks out.\n\nI think that's correct. Sometimes these age problems can be tricky, but breaking them down into equations makes it clearer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Father is 30 years old and son is 10 years old.}} \\]"
