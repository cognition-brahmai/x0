First, I need to handle the exponentiation, then multiplication, subtraction, and finally division.\n\nSo, starting with the exponentiation: 3^2 is 9. Now the expression becomes (6 * 9 - 4) / (9 - 5).\n\nNext, multiplication: 6 * 9 is 54. So now it's (54 - 4) / (9 - 5).\n\nThen, subtraction inside the parentheses: 54 - 4 is 50, and 9 - 5 is 4. So now it's 50 / 4.\n\nFinally, division: 50 divided by 4 is 12.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12.5."
