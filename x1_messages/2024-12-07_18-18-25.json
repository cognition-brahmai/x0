        "content": "To find the average speed of the entire round trip, we need to consider both the distance traveled and the total time taken for the trip. The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.\n\nLet's denote the distance between Town A and Town B as \\( d \\) kilometers.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total distance for the round trip. Since the train travels from Town A to Town B and back to Town A, the total distance is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = d + d = 2d \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total time taken for the round trip. The trip from Town A to Town B takes 2 hours, and the return trip takes 3 hours. Therefore, the total time is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 2 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{2d}{5} \\text{ kilometers per hour}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we can simplify this expression further. Since \\( d \\) represents the distance between Town A and Town B, and it cancels out in the expression, we can see that the average speed depends only on the total distance and total time.\n\nThus, the average speed of the entire round trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40} \\text{ kilometers per hour}\n\\]"
