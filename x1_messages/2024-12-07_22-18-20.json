        "content": "So I've got this question here: if a bacteria colony doubles in size every 20 minutes, how many times larger will it be after 5 hours? Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the time frames involved. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 5 hours would be 5 times 60, which is 300 minutes.\n\nNow, the bacteria colony doubles every 20 minutes. So, I need to find out how many 20-minute intervals there are in 300 minutes. That should be 300 divided by 20, which is 15. So, there are 15 intervals of 20 minutes in 5 hours.\n\nSince the colony doubles every 20 minutes, that means it multiplies by 2 each time. So, after 15 doublings, the size would be the initial size multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 15.\n\nLet me write that down: final size = initial size \u00d7 2^15.\n\nNow, 2^15 is 32,768. So, the colony would be 32,768 times larger after 5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 5 hours is indeed 300 minutes. 300 divided by 20 is 15. That's correct.\n\nAnd 2 raised to the 15th power is 32,768. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, the colony will be 32,768 times larger after 5 hours.\n\nThat's pretty impressive growth! It just goes to show how quickly exponential growth can escalate.\n\nI think that's the answer: 32,768 times larger.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32768} \\]"
