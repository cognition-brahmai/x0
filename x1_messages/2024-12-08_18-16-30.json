        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 4 white balls and 6 black balls, making a total of 10 balls. We're drawing three balls at random with replacement, and we want to find the probability that exactly two of them are white.\n\nFirst, since we're dealing with replacement, each draw is independent of the others. That means the outcome of one draw doesn't affect the outcomes of the subsequent draws.\n\nNext, let's determine the probability of drawing a white ball in a single draw. There are 4 white balls out of 10 total balls, so the probability of drawing a white ball is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing a black ball in a single draw is 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nNow, we're drawing three balls, and we want exactly two of them to be white. This means that out of the three draws, two should result in white balls, and one should result in a black ball.\n\nTo find the probability of this specific scenario, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k successes in n trials) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\n- n is the number of trials.\n\n- k is the number of successes.\n\nIn our case:\n\n- n = 3 (since we're drawing three balls).\n\n- k = 2 (we want exactly two white balls).\n\n- p = 2/5 (probability of drawing a white ball).\n\n- 1 - p = 3/5 (probability of drawing a black ball).\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(3, 2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 white balls out of 3 draws.\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3-2)!) = (3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 1) = 3.\n\nSo, there are 3 different sequences where we can have exactly two white balls and one black ball in three draws.\n\nNext, we'll calculate p^k = (2/5)^2 = 4/25.\n\nThen, (1 - p)^(n - k) = (3/5)^(3 - 2) = 3/5.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(exactly 2 white balls) = C(3, 2) * (2/5)^2 * (3/5)^1 = 3 * (4/25) * (3/5).\n\nLet's multiply these together:\n\nFirst, 3 * 4/25 = 12/25.\n\nThen, 12/25 * 3/5 = (12 * 3) / (25 * 5) = 36 / 125.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly two white balls in three draws with replacement is 36/125.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the possible sequences that result in exactly two white balls and one black ball:\n\n1. White, White, Black.\n\n2. White, Black, White.\n\n3. Black, White, White.\n\nEach of these sequences has the same probability: (2/5) * (2/5) * (3/5) = 12/125.\n\nSince there are three such sequences, the total probability is 3 * 12/125 = 36/125.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36/125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{36}{125}} \\]"
