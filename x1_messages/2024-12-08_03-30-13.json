Each plan should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mixture of both.\n\nHere are the tools at your disposal:\nWikiTool[input]: Tool that enables the user to fetch information from Wikipedia. This tool is especially handy when seeking knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, and other types of factual data. The input to this function should be a search string that would help locate the appropriate page. \nQAEngine[input]: A tool capable of answering questions either directly from common sense and general world knowledge, as well as answering questions given input context that may contain the answer.\nNewsAPI[input]: Fetches latest news articles related to the input query. Can be used to gather recent updates or developments on a topic.\nSentimentAnalyzer[input]: Analyzes sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given piece of text. Useful for understanding public opinion or reaction towards a particular event or person.\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: How did the stock market react after Apple Inc.'s last product launch?"

For that, I can use NewsAPI to get the latest news about Apple's product launches.\n#E1 = NewsAPI[\"Apple product launch\"]\n\nPlan: From the news articles, I should be able to identify the date of the last product launch. Once I have the date, I can then look into how the stock market reacted on and after that date. For this, I can use QAEngine to ask about the stock market reaction on that specific date.\n#E2 = QAEngine[\"How did the stock market react on and after \" + launch_date + \"?\", Given context: #E1]\n\nPlan: However, to get more detailed information, perhaps I should look up the stock prices around that time. Maybe using WikiTool to get information about Apple's stock performance around the product launch date would be helpful.\n#E3 = WikiTool[\"Apple Inc. stock performance \" + launch_date]\n\nPlan: Alternatively, I could use SentimentAnalyzer to analyze the sentiment of the news articles around the product launch to see if the public reaction was positive, negative, or neutral, which might correlate with the stock market reaction.\n#E4 = SentimentAnalyzer[\"Sentiment of news articles about Apple's product launch on \" + launch_date]\n\nPlan: Combining the stock market reaction and the sentiment analysis might give a more comprehensive answer. So, perhaps after getting both #E2 and #E4, I can use QAEngine again to summarize the overall reaction.\n#E5 = QAEngine[\"Summarize the stock market reaction and public sentiment after Apple's product launch on \" + launch_date + \".\", Given context: #E2 and #E4]\n\nFinal answer: #E5"
