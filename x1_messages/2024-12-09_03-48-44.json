        "content": "So I've got this system of equations to solve: y = 2x + 1 and y = -x + 4. I need to find the values of x and y that make both equations true at the same time. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that since both equations are already solved for y, this should be pretty straightforward. I can set them equal to each other because if both equal y, then they must equal each other. So, 2x + 1 = -x + 4. That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's move all the x terms to one side and the constants to the other. If I add x to both sides, that'll get rid of the -x on the right. So, 2x + x + 1 = 4. That simplifies to 3x + 1 = 4.\n\nNext, subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the x term: 3x = 3.\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 3: x = 1.\n\nOkay, so x is 1. Now, I need to find y. I can plug x = 1 back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first one: y = 2(1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nJust to double-check, let's plug x = 1 into the second equation: y = -1 + 4 = 3. Great, both equations give me y = 3, so that checks out.\n\nSo, the solution to the system is x = 1, y = 3.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe graphically? If I were to graph both lines, they should intersect at the point (1,3). Let's sketch that out mentally.\n\nThe first equation, y = 2x + 1, has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept at (0,1). The second equation, y = -x + 4, has a slope of -1 and a y-intercept at (0,4). If I plot these, they should cross at (1,3).\n\nLet me confirm that:\n\nFor x = 1:\n\nFirst equation: y = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\n\nSecond equation: y = -1 + 4 = 3.\n\nYes, both give y = 3.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's try another value, say x = 0.\n\nFirst equation: y = 2(0) + 1 = 1.\n\nSecond equation: y = -0 + 4 = 4.\n\nSo at x = 0, y is 1 and 4 respectively, which are different, meaning the lines intersect only at x = 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the substitution method, which is what I did, or the elimination method.\n\nLet's try the elimination method just for practice.\n\nWrite both equations:\n\ny - 2x = 1\n\ny + x = 4\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(y + x) - (y - 2x) = 4 - 1\n\nThat simplifies to y + x - y + 2x = 3\n\nCombining like terms: 3x = 3, so x = 1.\n\nThen plug back to find y, as before.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(1,\\ 3)} \\]"
