        "content": "So the car park charges $2 for the first hour and then $1 for each additional hour. If you park for 8 hours, how much would that cost? Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, there's a base charge of $2 for the very first hour. After that, every extra hour costs $1. So, if you park for 8 hours, the first hour costs $2, and the remaining 7 hours cost $1 each.\n\nLet me calculate that. The first hour is $2. Then, for the next 7 hours, it's $1 per hour. So, 7 hours times $1 is $7. Now, add that to the initial $2.\n\nTotal cost = $2 (for the first hour) + $7 (for the next 7 hours) = $9.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If you park for 8 hours, the first hour is $2, and each additional hour is $1. So, additional hours would be 8 - 1 = 7 hours.\n\nYes, 7 additional hours at $1 each is $7, plus the initial $2, totaling $9.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes parking costs are calculated differently, but based on the information given, this seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be sure, let's consider another approach. If the first hour is $2 and each additional hour is $1, then the total cost for n hours would be:\n\nTotal cost = $2 + ($1 * (n - 1))\n\nIn this case, n = 8.\n\nSo, Total cost = $2 + ($1 * (8 - 1)) = $2 + ($1 * 7) = $2 + $7 = $9.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the first hour as a fixed cost, and then add the variable cost based on the number of additional hours.\n\nFixed cost: $2\n\nVariable cost: $1 per additional hour\n\nTotal cost = Fixed cost + (Variable cost * number of additional hours)\n\nNumber of additional hours = total hours - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\n\nSo, Total cost = $2 + ($1 * 7) = $9\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods. I think $9 is the correct total cost for parking for 8 hours under these charges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
