        "content": "Let's see. The bakery sells three types of cookies: chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and sugar. The ratio of these cookies sold is 3:2:1, and the total number of cookies sold in one day is 600. I need to find out how many of each type were sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio like 3:2:1 tells me that for every 3 chocolate chip cookies sold, there are 2 oatmeal raisin cookies and 1 sugar cookie sold. So, the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 parts.\n\nNow, if 6 parts represent the total number of cookies sold, which is 600, then each part must represent 600 divided by 6. Let me calculate that:\n\n600 \u00f7 6 = 100\n\nSo, each part is 100 cookies.\n\nNow, since the ratio for chocolate chip is 3, the number of chocolate chip cookies sold is 3 parts times 100 cookies per part, which is:\n\n3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n\nSimilarly, for oatmeal raisin cookies, the ratio is 2, so:\n\n2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n\nAnd for sugar cookies, the ratio is 1, so:\n\n1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n\nLet me check if these add up to the total cookies sold:\n\n300 (chocolate chip) + 200 (oatmeal raisin) + 100 (sugar) = 600\n\nYes, that matches the total given.\n\nSo, the bakery sold 300 chocolate chip cookies, 200 oatmeal raisin cookies, and 100 sugar cookies in one day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300 \\text{ chocolate chip}, 200 \\text{ oatmeal raisin}, 100 \\text{ sugar}} \\]"
