        "content": "The primary purpose of a pacemaker in biomedical engineering is to regulate abnormal heart rhythms. So, the correct answer is D. To regulate abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nLet me explain this in more detail. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. This device uses low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It's primarily used to treat arrhythmias, which are irregularities in the heart's rhythm.\n\nOption A, \"To monitor heart rate,\" is partially correct because pacemakers do monitor the heart's activity, but their main function is to regulate the heart rhythm, not just to monitor it.\n\nOption B, \"To deliver medication directly to the heart,\" is not accurate. Pacemakers do not deliver medication; they deliver electrical impulses to regulate heart rhythm.\n\nOption C, \"To replace the function of the heart,\" is incorrect. A pacemaker does not replace the heart's function; it only helps regulate the heart's rhythm. The heart still pumps blood and performs its other functions.\n\nOption E, \"All of the above,\" is therefore also incorrect because not all the options accurately describe the primary purpose of a pacemaker.\n\nSo, in summary, while pacemakers do monitor heart activity, their primary function is to regulate abnormal heart rhythms by delivering electrical impulses as needed."
