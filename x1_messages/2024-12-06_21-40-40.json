        "content": "Let's see. So, originally, there are 10 employees, each working 40 hours per week. If the company hires 5 more employees, that makes a total of 15 employees. Then, they decide to reduce everyone's workweek to 35 hours. I need to find out the total number of hours worked by all employees combined after these changes.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of hours worked before the changes. That would be the number of employees times the hours each one works. So, 10 employees times 40 hours per week equals 400 hours per week.\n\nNow, after hiring 5 more employees, there are 15 employees. Each of them will work 35 hours per week. So, the total hours worked would be 15 times 35.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 15 times 35.\n\nWell, 15 times 30 is 450, and 15 times 5 is 75. So, 450 plus 75 equals 525.\n\nSo, after the changes, the total number of hours worked by all employees combined is 525 hours per week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nOriginally, with 10 employees at 40 hours each, that's 400 hours.\n\nAfter hiring 5 more, making it 15 employees, each working 35 hours.\n\n15 times 35 is indeed 525.\n\nSo, even though they reduced the hours per employee, the increase in the number of employees led to an overall increase in total hours worked.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{525} \\]"
