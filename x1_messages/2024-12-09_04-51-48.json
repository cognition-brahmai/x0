The average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nLet's denote the distance between Town A and Town B as \\( d \\) miles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip:\n\n1. **Trip from Town A to Town B:**\n   - Speed: 60 mph\n   - Time: \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours\n\n2. **Trip from Town B back to Town A:**\n   - Speed: 40 mph\n   - Time: \\( t_2 = \\frac{d}{40} \\) hours\n\nNext, we find the total distance and the total time for the round trip:\n\n- **Total distance:** \\( 2d \\) miles (going to Town B and returning to Town A)\n\n- **Total time:** \\( t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{40} \\) hours\n\nTo add these times together, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nt_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{40} = \\frac{2d}{120} + \\frac{3d}{120} = \\frac{5d}{120} = \\frac{d}{24} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, the average speed \\( v_{\\text{avg}} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \\times \\frac{24}{d} = 48 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire round trip is 48 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
