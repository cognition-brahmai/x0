        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 25 students, and there are 5 more girls than boys. We need to find out how many boys and girls there are.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let's say the number of boys is B and the number of girls is G. We know two things:\n\n1. The total number of students is 25, so B + G = 25.\n\n2. There are 5 more girls than boys, so G = B + 5.\n\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for B:\n\nB + (B + 5) = 25\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n2B + 5 = 25\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n2B = 20\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nB = 10\n\nNow that we know there are 10 boys, we can find the number of girls by plugging B back into the second equation:\n\nG = 10 + 5 = 15\n\nSo, there are 10 boys and 15 girls in the class.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. If there are 10 boys and 15 girls, that adds up to 25 students, which matches the first piece of information. Also, there are indeed 5 more girls than boys, since 15 - 10 = 5. Everything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, we could have approached this problem by considering the difference in numbers. Since there are 5 more girls than boys, the difference between the number of girls and boys is 5.\n\nLet's think about it differently. If we imagine that the number of boys and girls were equal, then the total number of students would be an even number because both groups would have the same amount. But in this case, there are 5 more girls, so the total is shifted by that difference.\n\nActually, in this specific problem, the first method is more straightforward, but it's good to consider different approaches to understand the problem better.\n\nSo, to sum it up, there are 10 boys and 15 girls in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ boys and } 15 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
