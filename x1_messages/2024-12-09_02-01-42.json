        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we've got a cruise ship that can carry 3,000 passengers, and it's going to run 7-day trips with tickets averaging $1,500 per passenger. The operating expenses are $2 million per week, covering things like fuel, food, crew salaries, and maintenance. We're supposed to calculate the annual revenue and profit margin, assuming the ship is 95% full on average and operates 52 weeks a year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many passengers are on each trip. With a capacity of 3,000 and an occupancy rate of 95%, the number of passengers per trip would be:\n\n3,000 passengers * 0.95 = 2,850 passengers per trip\n\nEach passenger pays $1,500, so the revenue per trip would be:\n\n2,850 passengers * $1,500/passenger = $4,275,000 per trip\n\nSince each trip is 7 days long and there are 52 weeks in a year, the ship would operate 52 trips in a year. So, the annual revenue would be:\n\n$4,275,000/trip * 52 trips/year = $222,300,000 per year\n\nNow, for the operating expenses. They're given as $2 million per week. Over 52 weeks, that would be:\n\n$2,000,000/week * 52 weeks/year = $104,000,000 per year\n\nTo find the profit, I need to subtract the total expenses from the total revenue:\n\n$222,300,000 - $104,000,000 = $118,300,000 per year\n\nThe profit margin is the profit divided by the revenue, expressed as a percentage. So:\n\n($118,300,000 / $222,300,000) * 100% \u2248 53.22%\n\nWait a minute, that seems pretty high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, passengers per trip: 3,000 * 0.95 = 2,850, that seems correct.\n\nRevenue per trip: 2,850 * $1,500 = $4,275,000, that checks out.\n\nNumber of trips per year: 52, so annual revenue is $4,275,000 * 52 = $222,300,000, correct.\n\nExpenses: $2,000,000 per week * 52 weeks = $104,000,000, that's right.\n\nProfit: $222,300,000 - $104,000,000 = $118,300,000.\n\nProfit margin: ($118,300,000 / $222,300,000) * 100% = approximately 53.22%, yes.\n\nHmm, a 53.22% profit margin seems quite high for a cruise line. Maybe I'm missing some expenses. Are there any other costs that shouldn't be overlooked?\n\nWell, the operating expenses include fuel, food, crew salaries, and maintenance, which are the major ongoing costs. But perhaps there are other expenses like port fees, marketing, overhead, etc., that aren't accounted for here. If those are significant, they would reduce the profit and thus the profit margin.\n\nBut based on the information provided, the annual revenue is $222,300,000 and the profit is $118,300,000, leading to a profit margin of about 53.22%.\n\nI think that's the answer, but it's always good to consider if there's more to the picture. In real life, there might be additional costs, but according to the data given, this seems accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Annual Revenue: } \\$222,300,000, \\text{ Profit Margin: } 53.22\\%} \\]"
