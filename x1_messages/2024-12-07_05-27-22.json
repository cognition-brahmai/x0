        "content": "Implementing a simple chat server in Java using sockets involves several steps. We need to create a server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously and broadcast messages from one client to all others. To achieve this, we'll use Java's built-in socket programming capabilities along with threading to manage multiple client connections.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - Create a server socket that listens for incoming client connections.\n   - Accept connections from clients and create a new thread for each client to handle their communications separately.\n\n2. **Client Handling:**\n   - Each client thread will read messages from its connected client.\n   - When a message is received, it will be broadcasted to all other connected clients.\n\n3. **Broadcast Mechanism:**\n   - Maintain a list of all connected client threads.\n   - When a message is received from one client, iterate through the list and send the message to all other clients.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ChatServer {\n    private static final int PORT = 12345;\n    private static List<ClientHandler> clients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Chat Server started on port \" + PORT);\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n            ClientHandler newClient = new ClientHandler(clientSocket);\n            clients.add(newClient);\n            newClient.start();\n        }\n    }\n\n    static void broadcastMessage(String message, ClientHandler source) {\n        for (ClientHandler client : clients) {\n            if (client != source) {\n                client.sendMessage(message);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass ClientHandler extends Thread {\n    private Socket socket;\n    private BufferedReader in;\n    private PrintWriter out;\n\n    public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n        this.socket = socket;\n    }\n\n    public void run() {\n        try {\n            in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n            out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n            String message;\n            while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                System.out.println(\"Received: \" + message);\n                ChatServer.broadcastMessage(message, this);\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            try {\n                socket.close();\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void sendMessage(String message) {\n        out.println(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **ChatServer Class:**\n   - Listens on a specified port for incoming client connections.\n   - Manages a list of connected `ClientHandler` threads.\n   - Broadcasts messages from one client to all others via the `broadcastMessage` method.\n\n2. **ClientHandler Class:**\n   - Manages communication with a single client.\n   - Reads messages from the client and broadcasts them using the `ChatServer.broadcastMessage` method.\n   - Sends messages to the client via the `sendMessage` method.\n\nThis setup ensures that the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously, and any message received from one client is sent to all other connected clients, creating a basic chat server functionality."
