        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train going from City A to City B at an average speed of 60 mph, and the distance between the cities is 240 miles. Then, it returns to City A at an increased average speed of 20 mph more than the outgoing trip, so that's 60 + 20 = 80 mph.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how long each leg of the trip takes.\n\nFor the trip from A to B:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 60 mph = 4 hours.\n\nFor the return trip from B to A:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.\n\nNow, the total distance for the round trip is twice the one-way distance, so:\n\nTotal distance = 240 miles * 2 = 480 miles.\n\nThe total time for the round trip is the sum of the times for each leg:\n\nTotal time = 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.\n\nThe average speed for the entire round trip is the total distance divided by the total time:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time = 480 miles / 7 hours \u2248 68.57 mph.\n\nBut wait, I should check if this is the correct way to calculate average speed. I recall that average speed is total distance over total time, but sometimes people get confused and just average the two speeds, which would be (60 + 80)/2 = 70 mph, but that's not correct in this context.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time.\n\nTotal distance is 480 miles.\n\nTotal time is 7 hours.\n\n480 divided by 7 is approximately 68.57 mph.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for average speed when two equal distances are traveled at different speeds:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * 60 * 80) / (60 + 80) = (9600) / (140) = 68.57 mph.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire round trip is approximately 68.57 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{68.57 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
