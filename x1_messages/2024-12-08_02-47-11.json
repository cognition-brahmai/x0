        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in the class. 60% passed their math exam, and 80% passed their science exam. I need to find out how many students passed both exams.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate how many students passed math and how many passed science.\n\nNumber of students who passed math:\n\n30 * 60% = 30 * 0.6 = 18 students\n\nNumber of students who passed science:\n\n30 * 80% = 30 * 0.8 = 24 students\n\nNow, I need to find the number of students who passed both exams. I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nIn this case, the \"union\" would be the total number of students who passed at least one of the exams, and the \"intersection\" is the number of students who passed both.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- M = number of students who passed math = 18\n\n- S = number of students who passed science = 24\n\n- B = number of students who passed both exams\n\n- Total students who passed at least one exam = M + S - B\n\nBut I don't know the total number of students who passed at least one exam. However, since there are only 30 students in the class, and M + S = 18 + 24 = 42, which is greater than 30, that means some students must have passed both exams.\n\nIn fact, the overlap (students who passed both) is M + S - total students who passed at least one exam.\n\nBut what is the total number of students who passed at least one exam? It could be up to 30, but without more information, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can assume that some students might have failed both exams. But the problem doesn't mention that. It just asks for the number of students who passed both exams.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the maximum and minimum possible values for B.\n\nThe maximum value for B would be the smaller of M and S, which is 18, since only 18 students passed math.\n\nThe minimum value for B would be M + S - total students = 18 + 24 - 30 = 42 - 30 = 12.\n\nSo, B can range from 12 to 18.\n\nBut I need to find the exact number. Maybe there's more information I can use.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the number of students who passed only math, only science, and both.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Only math: M - B = 18 - B\n\n- Only science: S - B = 24 - B\n\n- Both: B\n\n- Total: (18 - B) + (24 - B) + B = 30\n\nSimplifying:\n\n18 - B + 24 - B + B = 30\n\n42 - B = 30\n\nSo, B = 42 - 30 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 students passed both exams.\n\nAlternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nTotal who passed at least one exam = M + S - B\n\nBut total students are 30, and possibly some failed both exams. But the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nWait, maybe all 30 students passed at least one exam. In that case, M + S - B = 30\n\nSo, 18 + 24 - B = 30\n\n42 - B = 30\n\nB = 12\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, 12 students passed both exams.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if it's possible that some students failed both exams.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that some students failed both exams, say F students.\n\nThen, the total number of students who passed at least one exam is 30 - F.\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nM + S - B = 30 - F\n\n18 + 24 - B = 30 - F\n\n42 - B = 30 - F\n\nB = 42 - 30 + F\n\nB = 12 + F\n\nBut B cannot be greater than M or S, so B \u2264 18.\n\nIf F = 0, B = 12\n\nIf F = 6, B = 18\n\nSo, without knowing F, B can range from 12 to 18.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify the number of students who failed both exams, so perhaps it's safe to assume that F = 0, meaning all students passed at least one exam.\n\nIn that case, B = 12.\n\nAlternatively, if some students failed both exams, B would be higher.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is that at least 12 students passed both exams, but without knowing F, we can't determine an exact number.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for \"how many students passed both exams?\", implying there is a specific number.\n\nGiven the information provided, and assuming that all students passed at least one exam, then B = 12.\n\nAlternatively, if some students failed both exams, then B could be higher, up to 18.\n\nBut without additional information, the most reasonable assumption is that all students passed at least one exam, hence B = 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that 12 students passed both exams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
