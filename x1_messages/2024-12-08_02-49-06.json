        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling from Station A to Station B at a constant speed. Halfway through the journey, it starts raining, and because of that, the train's speed decreases by 25%. The total travel time with this delay is 4 hours. We need to find out how long the trip would have taken without any rain affecting the speed.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the total distance between Station A and Station B is D kilometers. Since the train travels at a constant speed initially, let's call that speed S kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, the train travels halfway, which is D/2 kilometers, at speed S. The time taken for the first half is (D/2)/S = D/(2S) hours.\n\nThen, it starts raining, and the speed decreases by 25%. So, the new speed is S - 0.25S = 0.75S kilometers per hour.\n\nThe remaining half of the journey, another D/2 kilometers, is traveled at this reduced speed. The time taken for the second half is (D/2)/(0.75S) = (D/2)/(3S/4) = (D/2)*(4/(3S)) = (2D)/(3S) hours.\n\nThe total travel time is the sum of the times for both halves, which is D/(2S) + 2D/(3S) hours. According to the problem, this total time is 4 hours. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nD/(2S) + 2D/(3S) = 4\n\nTo solve for D/S, which represents the time it would take to travel the whole distance at the initial speed S, let's first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The common denominator for 2S and 3S is 6S.\n\nRewriting both fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(D/(2S)) * (3/3) = 3D/(6S)\n\n(2D/(3S)) * (2/2) = 4D/(6S)\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n3D/(6S) + 4D/(6S) = 7D/(6S) = 4\n\nSo, 7D/(6S) = 4\n\nWe can solve for D/S:\n\n7D/(6S) = 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 6S:\n\n7D = 24S\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7S:\n\nD/S = 24/7\n\nSo, D/S = 24/7 hours.\n\nBut D/S represents the time it would take to travel the entire distance at the initial speed S, without any rain affecting the speed.\n\nTherefore, the trip would have taken 24/7 hours without the rain.\n\nTo express this in hours and minutes, 24/7 hours is approximately 3.4286 hours, which is 3 hours and 0.4286*60 minutes, which is about 3 hours and 25.714 minutes, or approximately 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects the answer in fractions, 24/7 hours is the exact answer.\n\nSo, the trip would have taken 24/7 hours without the rain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{7}\\text{ hours}} \\]"
