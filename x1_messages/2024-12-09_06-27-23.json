        "content": "That sounds like Tanzania. The Great Rift Valley runs through it, and it's home to Mount Kilimanjaro, which is the highest peak in Africa, and the Serengeti National Park, known for its incredible wildlife migrations. But let me double-check to make sure.\n\nFirst, the Great Rift Valley is a geological feature that runs from Lebanon in the Middle East through eastern Africa to Mozambique. So, several African countries have parts of the Great Rift Valley within their borders, including Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, and others.\n\nMount Kilimanjaro is definitely in Tanzania. It's located near the city of Moshi and is a major tourist attraction for climbers and trekkers.\n\nSerengeti National Park is also in Tanzania. It's famous for its vast grasslands and the annual wildebeest migration, which is one of the largest migrations of wildlife in the world.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Tanzania seems to be the African nation that fits the description. But maybe there's another country that shares some of these features. Let's see.\n\nKenya is another country in eastern Africa that has parts of the Great Rift Valley, and it's home to Mount Kenya, which is the second-highest peak in Africa after Kilimanjaro. Kenya also has the Maasai Mara National Reserve, which is part of the same ecosystem as the Serengeti and where the wildebeest migration also takes place.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions Mount Kilimanjaro and Serengeti National Park, which are both in Tanzania. So, while Kenya shares some of these features, it doesn't have Kilimanjaro or the Serengeti.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Tanzania.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's another country that I'm not thinking of that has both the Great Rift Valley, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Serengeti National Park. Let me think again.\n\nMount Kilimanjaro is solely in Tanzania, although it's near the border with Kenya. Serengeti National Park is also entirely in Tanzania. And the Great Rift Valley passes through Tanzania as well.\n\nSo, Tanzania is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any other countries might fit this description.\n\nEthiopia has parts of the Great Rift Valley, but it doesn't have Mount Kilimanjaro or the Serengeti. So, that's not the right fit.\n\nUganda also has parts of the Great Rift Valley, but again, no Kilimanjaro or Serengeti.\n\nRwanda and Burundi are neighboring countries to Tanzania and have the Rift Valley, but not Kilimanjaro or the Serengeti.\n\nTherefore, it's clear that Tanzania is the African nation that has the Great Rift Valley, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Serengeti National Park.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Tanzania}} \\]"
