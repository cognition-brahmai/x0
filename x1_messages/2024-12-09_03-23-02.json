        "content": "So there are 100 birds sitting on a fence, and a hunter shoots and kills 10 of them. The question is, how many birds are left on the fence?\n\nAt first glance, it seems like a straightforward subtraction problem: 100 birds minus 10 killed birds equals 90 birds left. But let's think about it more carefully.\n\nWhen a hunter shoots and kills some birds, it's likely that the sound of the gunshot would scare the remaining birds off the fence. So, even if some birds are still alive, they might fly away due to the noise.\n\nConsidering this real-world aspect, it's possible that after the hunter shoots and kills 10 birds, the rest of the birds would fly away out of fear. Therefore, there might be no birds left on the fence.\n\nBut perhaps the birds are of a particularly brave species that wouldn't be scared by gunshots, or maybe the fence is far enough from the hunter that the sound doesn't reach them. In that case, the remaining 90 birds might stay on the fence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only some of the birds fly away, and others stay. But without more information, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nGiven that it's a riddle, the answer might be zero, assuming that the gunshot scares all the remaining birds away. But if it's a straightforward math problem, then 90 birds are left.\n\nI think the most likely answer expected in this context is zero, considering the typical assumptions in such puzzles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
