        "content": "So there are 25 red balls and 15 blue balls in a box, making a total of 40 balls. You pick one ball, look at its color, put it back in the box, and then pick another ball. You want to know the probability of picking a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nFirst, since you're putting the ball back each time, each pick is independent. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first try is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So that's 25 red balls out of 40 total balls, which is 25/40 or 5/8.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball on the second try is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 15 blue balls out of 40 total balls, or 15/40, which simplifies to 3/8.\n\nSince these are independent events, to find the probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first picking a red ball and then a blue ball\u2014you multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the probability is (5/8) * (3/8) = 15/64.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red ball followed by a blue ball is 15/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{64}} \\]"
