        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a film production company planning to shoot a movie in different locations around the world, and they have a total budget of $30 million. They've already estimated some costs: $10 million for cast salaries, $8 million for crew salaries, $6 million for equipment rental, and $4 million for location permits. Now, besides these, they also need to account for travel expenses, accommodation, and daily allowances for both the cast and the crew. There are 50 cast members and 200 crew members, and I need to figure out the average amount available per person for these additional expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's already included in the budget and what's left for the additional expenses. The total budget is $30 million, and they've allocated amounts for cast salaries, crew salaries, equipment rental, and location permits. So, I should sum up these allocated amounts and then subtract that total from the overall budget to find out how much is left for travel, accommodation, and daily allowances.\n\nLet's add up the allocated amounts:\n\nCast salaries: $10 million\n\nCrew salaries: $8 million\n\nEquipment rental: $6 million\n\nLocation permits: $4 million\n\nTotal allocated = $10m + $8m + $6m + $4m = $28 million\n\nNow, subtract this from the total budget:\n\nTotal budget - Total allocated = $30m - $28m = $2 million\n\nSo, there's $2 million left for travel expenses, accommodation, and daily allowances for both cast and crew.\n\nNext, I need to find out the total number of people for whom these expenses are to be covered. There are 50 cast members and 200 crew members.\n\nTotal people = 50 cast + 200 crew = 250 people\n\nNow, to find the average amount available per person for these additional expenses, I'll divide the remaining budget by the total number of people.\n\nAverage per person = Remaining budget / Total people = $2,000,000 / 250 = $8,000\n\nWait a minute, does that mean each person gets $8,000 for travel, accommodation, and daily allowances combined? That seems a bit high, but maybe for international travel and staying in various locations, it could be possible.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total allocated expenses: $10m + $8m + $6m + $4m = $28m\n\nTotal budget: $30m\n\nRemaining budget: $30m - $28m = $2m\n\nTotal people: 50 + 200 = 250\n\nAverage per person: $2,000,000 / 250 = $8,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider whether the travel, accommodation, and daily allowances are to be divided equally among all cast and crew members, or if there's a different distribution based on their roles. For example, main cast members might have higher travel and accommodation costs than background actors or some crew members.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the average amount available per person, so it's likely that it's meant to be divided equally among all 250 people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cast and crew have different allowances. Maybe cast members get more because they have higher profiles and might require better accommodations or more expenses covered.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify different rates for cast and crew, I think averaging it out per person is the way to go.\n\nSo, the average amount available per person for travel expenses, accommodation, and daily allowances is $8,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the $2 million is to be divided only among the cast or only among the crew, but the question says \"for the cast and crew,\" so it's probably for both.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are other expenses that should be considered, but according to the problem, the $30 million budget covers all expenses, and we've accounted for the major ones, with $2 million left for these additional expenses.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is $8,000 per person.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8000} \\]"
