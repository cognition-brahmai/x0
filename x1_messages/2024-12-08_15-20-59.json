        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 12 balls. I need to find the probability that when I pick two balls at random without replacement, both are of the same color. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I pick the first ball, it stays outside the bag, and the second ball is picked from the remaining balls. So, the total number of balls changes after the first pick.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability that both balls are the same color. That means either both are red or both are blue. So, I can think of this as two separate events: both red (event A) or both blue (event B). Since these are mutually exclusive events (they can't happen at the same time), the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of event A and event B.\n\nSo, P(same color) = P(both red) + P(both blue)\n\nLet's calculate P(both red) first.\n\nThere are 5 red balls out of 12 total balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball first is 5/12.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 11 balls remaining in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 4/11.\n\nTherefore, P(both red) = (5/12) * (4/11)\n\nNow, let's calculate P(both blue).\n\nThere are 7 blue balls out of 12 total balls. So, the probability of picking a blue ball first is 7/12.\n\nAfter picking one blue ball, there are now 6 blue balls left and a total of 11 balls remaining in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another blue ball is 6/11.\n\nTherefore, P(both blue) = (7/12) * (6/11)\n\nNow, add these two probabilities together to get P(same color).\n\nP(same color) = (5/12)*(4/11) + (7/12)*(6/11)\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, (5/12)*(4/11) = 20/132\n\nSecond, (7/12)*(6/11) = 42/132\n\nAdding them up: 20/132 + 42/132 = 62/132\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2: 31/66\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are of the same color is 31/66.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is C(12,2) = 12*11/2 = 66\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls is C(5,2) = 10\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 blue balls is C(7,2) = 21\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 + 21 = 31\n\nTherefore, the probability is 31/66\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 31/66.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{31}{66}} \\]"
