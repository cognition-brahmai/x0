        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: \"In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing three aces in a row without replacement?\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, and among them, there are 4 aces\u2014one for each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of drawing three aces in a row without replacement. That means once I draw a card, I don't put it back into the deck, so the number of cards left in the deck decreases with each draw.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. But since this is a sequence of events without replacement, I need to consider the probability of each event happening in sequence.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. **First draw:** The probability of drawing an ace from a full deck of 52 cards.\n\n2. **Second draw:** Given that the first card was an ace, the probability of drawing another ace from the remaining 51 cards.\n\n3. **Third draw:** Given that the first two cards were aces, the probability of drawing a third ace from the remaining 50 cards.\n\nThen, since these are sequential events without replacement, I should multiply these probabilities together to get the overall probability.\n\nLet me calculate each step.\n\n**First draw:**\n\nTotal aces: 4\n\nTotal cards: 52\n\nProbability of drawing an ace: 4/52 = 1/13\n\n**Second draw:**\n\nIf the first card was an ace, then:\n\nTotal aces left: 3\n\nTotal cards left: 51\n\nProbability of drawing another ace: 3/51 = 1/17\n\n**Third draw:**\n\nIf the first two cards were aces, then:\n\nTotal aces left: 2\n\nTotal cards left: 50\n\nProbability of drawing a third ace: 2/50 = 1/25\n\nNow, to find the overall probability, I multiply these probabilities together:\n\n(1/13) * (1/17) * (1/25)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply 1/13 by 1/17:\n\n(1/13) * (1/17) = 1/(13*17) = 1/221\n\nThen, multiply that by 1/25:\n\n(1/221) * (1/25) = 1/(221*25)\n\nNow, 221 times 25. Let's see:\n\n200 * 25 = 5000\n\n21 * 25 = 525\n\nSo, 221 * 25 = 5000 + 525 = 5525\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is 1/5525.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 1/13 * 1/17:\n\nYes, that's 1/(13*17) = 1/221\n\nThen, 1/221 * 1/25 = 1/(221*25) = 1/5525\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 3 aces out of 4, divided by the number of ways to choose any 3 cards out of 52.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 aces from 4 is C(4,3) = 4\n\nThe number of ways to choose any 3 cards from 52 is C(52,3) = (52*51*50)/6 = (52/2)*17*25) = 22100/6 = 1771\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me calculate C(52,3) again.\n\nC(52,3) = 52! / (3! * (52-3)!) = (52*51*50)/6 = (52/2)*(51/3)*50 = 26*17*50 = 22100 / 6 = 3771.333, which can't be right because combinations must be whole numbers.\n\nWait, I must have miscalculated.\n\nLet me compute C(52,3) properly:\n\n52 choose 3 is (52*51*50)/(3*2*1) = (52/2)*(51/3)*50 = 26*17*50 = 26*850 = 22100 / 6 = 3771.333, which is not possible.\n\nWait, 52*51*50 = 132600\n\nDivide by 6: 132600 / 6 = 22100\n\nWait, that's not right. Let's calculate it step by step.\n\n52*51 = 2652\n\n2652*50 = 132600\n\nNow, divide by 6: 132600 / 6 = 22100\n\nWait, but 22100 is not divisible by 6, because 6*3683 = 22098, which is 2 less than 22100. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the probability approach I did earlier, which gave me 1/5525.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes: ways to choose 3 aces from 4, which is C(4,3) = 4\n\nTotal possible outcomes: ways to choose any 3 cards from 52, which is C(52,3) = 22100 / 6 = 22100 / 6 = 3771.333, which can't be right because combinations must be whole numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate C(52,3) as follows:\n\nC(52,3) = (52*51*50)/(3*2*1) = (52/2)*(51/3)*50 = 26*17*50 = 26*850 = 22100\n\nWait, but 22100 divided by 6 is 3683.333, which is not a whole number, but combinations must be whole numbers. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the step-by-step probability approach I used earlier, which gave me 1/5525.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the probabilities step by step, considering the decreasing number of cards.\n\nSo, probability of first ace: 4/52 = 1/13\n\nProbability of second ace given first was ace: 3/51 = 1/17\n\nProbability of third ace given first two were aces: 2/50 = 1/25\n\nSo, overall probability: (1/13)*(1/17)*(1/25) = 1/(13*17*25) = 1/(221*25) = 1/5525\n\nNow, to cross-verify, let's consider the combinations approach again.\n\nC(4,3) / C(52,3) = 4 / C(52,3)\n\nC(52,3) = (52*51*50)/6 = (52/2)*(51/3)*50 = 26*17*50 = 26*850 = 22100 / 6 = 3771.333\n\nWait, that's not making sense. Wait, perhaps I should calculate C(52,3) as (52*51*50)/(3*2*1) = (132600)/6 = 22100, which is incorrect because 52*51*50 = 132600, divided by 6 is indeed 22100, but that's not correct because C(52,3) should be 22100 / 6 = 3771.333, which is not possible.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to use a calculator for this.\n\nLet me compute C(52,3) properly.\n\nC(52,3) = 52! / (3! * 49!) = (52*51*50)/(3*2*1) = 132600 / 6 = 22100, which is not correct because 22100 is not divisible by 6.\n\nWait, 132600 divided by 6 is actually 22100, but 22100 is not the correct value for C(52,3). I must be making a mistake.\n\nLet me check with a calculator.\n\nCalculating 52 choose 3:\n\nC(52,3) = 22100 / 6 = 3771.333, which can't be right because combinations must be whole numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the value of C(52,3).\n\nUpon checking, C(52,3) is actually 22100 / 6 = 3771.333, which can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in division.\n\nWait, 52*51*50 = 132600\n\n3*2*1 = 6\n\n132600 / 6 = 22100, which is not correct because 22100 is not divisible by 6.\n\nWait, 22100 divided by 6 is 3683.333, which is not a whole number, but combinations must be whole numbers. There's clearly a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate C(52,3) differently.\n\nC(52,3) = (52*51*50)/6 = (132600)/6 = 22100, which is not correct.\n\nWait, 52*51 = 2652\n\n2652*50 = 132600\n\n132600 / 6 = 22100, but that's not right. Wait, perhaps I need to check my multiplication.\n\n52*51 is indeed 2652.\n\n2652*50 is indeed 132600.\n\n132600 / 6 = 22100, but that can't be right because 22100 is not divisible by 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use a calculator to divide 132600 by 6.\n\n132600 / 6 = 22100, but 22100 is not divisible by 6. Wait, no, 22100 is the result of 132600 / 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should accept that my initial probability calculation is correct, which is 1/5525, and consider that as the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look up the correct value of C(52,3).\n\nUpon checking, C(52,3) is actually 22100, not 22100 / 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, C(52,3) = (52*51*50)/(3*2*1) = 132600 / 6 = 22100\n\nYes, so C(52,3) = 22100\n\nThen, the probability would be C(4,3) / C(52,3) = 4 / 22100 = 1 / 5525\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/5525.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5525}}"
