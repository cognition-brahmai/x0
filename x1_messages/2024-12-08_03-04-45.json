        "content": "So there are 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 3 green balls in a bag, and I need to pick one ball at random without looking. I need to find out the probability that I will pick either a blue or a green ball.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of balls in the bag. Let's add them up:\n\n5 red + 4 blue + 3 green = 12 balls in total.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a blue or a green ball. So, the number of favorable outcomes would be the number of blue balls plus the number of green balls.\n\nThat is 4 blue + 3 green = 7 favorable outcomes.\n\nAnd the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 12.\n\nSo, the probability should be 7/12.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that picking a blue or a green ball are mutually exclusive events. That is, picking a blue ball doesn't affect the probability of picking a green ball, and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, since you're only picking one ball, they are mutually exclusive because you can't pick both a blue and a green ball at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a blue or a green ball is indeed the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 1 minus the probability of picking a red ball.\n\nSince there are 5 red balls out of 12, the probability of picking a red ball is 5/12.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a red ball (which would be picking either blue or green) is 1 - 5/12 = 7/12.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier, so that's a good check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportions.\n\nThere are 4 blue balls and 3 green balls, making 7 non-red balls.\n\nSo, the chance of picking a non-red ball is 7 out of 12.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI think 7/12 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{12}} \\]"
