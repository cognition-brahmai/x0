        "content": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, such as A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], we can use a specific formula. The inverse of a matrix A = [[a, b], [c, d]] is given by (1/determinant(A)) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]], provided that the determinant is not zero.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the determinant of A. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is (a*d - b*c). For matrix A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], the determinant is (1*4 - 2*3) = 4 - 6 = -2.\n\nSince the determinant is not zero, the inverse exists. Now, we can plug the values into the formula for the inverse.\n\nThe inverse of A is (1/-2) * [[4, -2], [-3, 1]].\n\nNow, we multiply each element of the matrix by (1/-2):\n\n- (1/-2)*4 = -2\n\n- (1/-2)*(-2) = 1\n\n- (1/-2)*(-3) = 1.5\n\n- (1/-2)*1 = -0.5\n\nSo, the inverse of A is [[-2, 1], [1.5, -0.5]].\n\nTo verify, we can multiply A by its inverse and check if we get the identity matrix.\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n\nA * A-inverse = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] * [[-2, 1], [1.5, -0.5]]\n\nFirst row, first column: (1*(-2) + 2*1.5) = -2 + 3 = 1\n\nFirst row, second column: (1*1 + 2*(-0.5)) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSecond row, first column: (3*(-2) + 4*1.5) = -6 + 6 = 0\n\nSecond row, second column: (3*1 + 4*(-0.5)) = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nSo, the result is [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which is the identity matrix. Therefore, the inverse is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1 \\\\ 1.5 & -0.5 \\end{bmatrix}} \\]"
