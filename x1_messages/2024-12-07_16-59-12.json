        "content": "Yes, THC can be stored in your fat cells for a long time. This is because THC is fat-soluble, meaning it dissolves in fats and is stored in fatty tissues in the body. Over time, as these fatty tissues are broken down, the THC is released back into the bloodstream, which is why THC can be detected in drug tests for weeks or even months after use, depending on factors such as frequency of use and individual metabolism."
