        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the farmer has 12 apple trees, and each tree produces 20 apples. First, I need to find out the total number of apples the farmer has. That should be straightforward: I just multiply the number of trees by the number of apples per tree.\n\nSo, 12 trees times 20 apples per tree is 240 apples in total. Got it.\n\nNow, the farmer sells these apples in bags of 5. So, I need to figure out how many bags of 5 apples he can make from 240 apples. This seems like a division problem. I'll divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.\n\n240 apples divided by 5 apples per bag should give me the number of bags. Let's do the division: 240 divided by 5 is 48. So, the farmer can sell 48 bags of apples.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if there are any apples left over that don't make a full bag. In other words, is there a remainder when 240 is divided by 5?\n\nLet me check: 5 times 48 is 240, which means there's no remainder. So, all apples are used up in the bags. That makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the farmer can sell bags of fewer than 5 apples. But the problem says he sells them in bags of 5, so probably not. He likely won't sell partial bags.\n\nAlso, maybe I should confirm the initial calculations. 12 trees times 20 apples each is indeed 240 apples.\n\nAnd 240 divided by 5 is definitely 48. Seems solid.\n\nI think that's the straightforward approach, and it probably gives the correct answer. But let's see if there's another way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of units. Each tree produces 20 apples, and each bag contains 5 apples. So, per tree, the number of bags is 20 divided by 5, which is 4 bags per tree.\n\nThen, with 12 trees, the total number of bags would be 12 trees times 4 bags per tree, which is also 48 bags.\n\nThis matches the earlier result, which is a good sign. It's always reassuring when different methods give the same answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the total number of apples and the bag size. Since each bag has 5 apples, the number of bags is simply the total apples divided by 5.\n\nWe already did that and got 48, but maybe I can think about it in terms of multiplication. If the farmer sells x bags of 5 apples, then the total number of apples is 5x. We know the total is 240, so 5x = 240. Solving for x gives x = 240 / 5 = 48.\n\nAgain, the same answer. This reinforces that 48 is the correct number of bags.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, is there a possibility that some apples are defective or can't be sold? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I assume all apples are sellable.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that the apples are sold in bags of 5, so I don't need to consider selling individual apples or different bag sizes.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the farmer can sell fractional bags, but since bags are discrete units, and the problem implies whole bags, I think we're safe assuming only whole bags are sold.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that 240 divided by 5 is a whole number, there are no issues with partial bags.\n\nSo, all paths lead to 48 bags.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can use a different method. Let's try adding up the apples tree by tree and see how many bags that accumulates to.\n\nTake one tree: 20 apples, divided by 5 per bag, is 4 bags.\n\nTwo trees: 40 apples, divided by 5, is 8 bags.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nTree 1: 4 bags\n\nTree 2: 4 bags\n\n...\n\nUp to tree 12.\n\nSo, 12 trees times 4 bags per tree is 48 bags.\n\nAgain, 48 bags.\n\nI think it's clear that the answer is 48 bags.\n\nBut let's think about it in terms of total apples and bag size once more, just to make sure.\n\nTotal apples: 12 trees * 20 apples/tree = 240 apples.\n\nBag size: 5 apples/bag.\n\nNumber of bags: 240 apples / 5 apples/bag = 48 bags.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI can also consider the units to ensure clarity. When I multiply trees by apples per tree, I get apples. Then, dividing apples by apples per bag gives me the number of bags. The units make sense.\n\nAdditionally, if I were to visualize this, imagine 12 trees, each with 20 apples. Picking all the apples and putting them into bags of 5, I would end up with 48 bags.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any ambiguity in the problem statement, and the calculations are straightforward. Therefore, I'm confident that 48 bags is the correct answer.\n\nJust for completeness, maybe I should consider if the farmer sells the bags in any particular order or if there are any restrictions on selling, but the problem doesn't specify anything like that. It's a straightforward calculation of how many bags can be made from the total apples available.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the farmer can sell 48 bags of apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
