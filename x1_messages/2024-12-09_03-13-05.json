        "content": "So there are 10 people in a room, and everyone shakes hands with every other person exactly once. We need to find out how many handshakes take place in total. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that in these kinds of problems, where we have to find the number of unique pairs from a group, we can use combinations. Combinations help us figure out how many ways we can choose a certain number of items from a larger set without regard to the order.\n\nIn this case, we're choosing pairs of people for handshakes, so it's about selecting 2 people out of 10. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items.\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n- \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, for our problem:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\times 8!}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating factorials can get big quickly, but notice that 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!, so the 8! in numerator and denominator will cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2! \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 45 unique handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this approach because sometimes I get confused with combinations and permutations. Permutations consider the order, whereas combinations do not. In handshakes, the order doesn't matter; shaking hands between Tom and Jerry is the same as shaking hands between Jerry and Tom. So, combinations are indeed the right choice here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, the first person shakes hands with 9 others, the second with 8 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), the third with 7, and so on, down to the last person who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already done so with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45\n\nAgain, we get 45 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n-1 natural numbers, since each person shakes hands with n-1 others, and there are n people, but we divide by 2 to avoid double-counting:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total handshakes} = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, all these methods lead us to the same answer: 45 handshakes.\n\nBut the problem mentions Tom, Jerry, and Alice specifically. Do they have any special role in this problem? Hmm. Actually, no. The problem just sets the scene with 10 people, including Tom, Jerry, and Alice, but the handshakes are between everyone, so these names don't affect the calculation. It's just to make the problem more relatable.\n\nHowever, if there were any constraints or special conditions involving these specific people, like they don't shake hands with each other or something, then that would affect the total. But in this case, there are no such constraints mentioned. So, we can ignore the specific names and just focus on the numbers.\n\nWait, to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any assumptions we might be missing. For example, is there a possibility that some people don't shake hands with each other due to personal reasons or whatever? But the problem says \"everyone shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" so no, that's not the case here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether shaking hands is a two-way event. Meaning, if Tom shakes hands with Jerry, does that count as one handshake or two? In real life, it's one handshake between two people. So, in our calculation, each handshake is counted once, not twice.\n\nAlso, no one shakes hands with themselves, which is already accounted for since we're choosing pairs of different people.\n\nSo, I think our calculation is solid. There are 45 handshakes in total.\n\nJust to make sure, let's try another approach. Suppose we have 10 people, and each can shake hands with 9 others. So, total handshakes would be 10 \u00d7 9 = 90. But this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2 to get the correct number: 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nAgain, 45 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, we can list out all possible pairs:\n\nPerson 1 shakes hands with persons 2 through 10: that's 9 handshakes.\n\nPerson 2 shakes hands with persons 3 through 10: that's 8 handshakes (since they already shook hands with person 1).\n\nPerson 3 shakes hands with persons 4 through 10: 7 handshakes, and so on, down to person 9 shaking hands with person 10: 1 handshake.\n\nSo, total handshakes: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's clear now that the total number of handshakes is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
