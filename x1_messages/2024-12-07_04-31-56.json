Each plan should have a corresponding evidence value, which is the output of one of the functions given an input string.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nYahooSearch[input]: A tool that lets the user search for information through the Yahoo search engine. It's useful for locating a variety of sites that could hold the answer to the user's question.\nHyperlinkFinder[input]: Finds hyperlinks from plain text and delivers a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-separated links, where input is one or more links, and yields plain text output containing the content of the links.\nQAModel[input]: A question-answering model powered by artificial intelligence, highly efficient at answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input has to be a text question that refers to a :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: How did the Great Depression impact the global economy?"
