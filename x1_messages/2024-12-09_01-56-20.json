        "content": "Let's see what we've got here. There's a store that sells apples, oranges, and bananas, and we're given some ratios between them. The ratio of apples to oranges is 3:2, and the ratio of oranges to bananas is 5:4. We're also told that there are 60 oranges in stock, and we need to find out how many apples and bananas there are combined.\n\nFirst, I need to understand these ratios. The apples to oranges ratio is 3:2, which means for every 3 apples, there are 2 oranges. Similarly, the oranges to bananas ratio is 5:4, meaning for every 5 oranges, there are 4 bananas.\n\nNow, since we know there are 60 oranges, I can use this information to find out the number of apples and bananas.\n\nLet me start with the apples. The ratio of apples to oranges is 3:2. So, if there are 2 parts of oranges, there are 3 parts of apples.\n\nGiven that there are 60 oranges, which correspond to the '2 parts' in the ratio, I can find out what one part is by dividing 60 by 2.\n\nOne part = 60 / 2 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the number of apples, which is 3 parts, would be:\n\nApples = 3 * 30 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 apples.\n\nNext, let's find out the number of bananas using the oranges to bananas ratio, which is 5:4.\n\nThis means that for every 5 parts of oranges, there are 4 parts of bananas.\n\nWe know there are 60 oranges, which correspond to the 5 parts in the ratio.\n\nSo, one part = 60 / 5 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the number of bananas, which is 4 parts, would be:\n\nBananas = 4 * 12 = 48.\n\nSo, there are 48 bananas.\n\nNow, to find the total number of apples and bananas combined, I just need to add them together:\n\nTotal = Apples + Bananas = 90 + 48 = 138.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for apples:\n\nApples : Oranges = 3 : 2\n\nOranges = 60\n\nOne part = 60 / 2 = 30\n\nApples = 3 * 30 = 90\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, for bananas:\n\nOranges : Bananas = 5 : 4\n\nOranges = 60\n\nOne part = 60 / 5 = 12\n\nBananas = 4 * 12 = 48\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nCombined, apples and bananas are 90 + 48 = 138.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{138} \\]"
