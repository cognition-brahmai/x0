        "content": "So in this problem, it's saying that 3 out of every 5 people in a town own cats, and there are 200 people in total. I need to find out how many people do not own cats.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"3 out of every 5 people own cats\" means. This seems like a ratio or a fraction of the total population that owns cats. So, if 3 out of 5 own cats, that means that for every group of 5 people, 3 have cats and the remaining 2 do not.\n\nTo find out how many people own cats, I can set up a proportion. If 3 out of 5 people own cats, then the number of people who own cats out of 200 can be found by multiplying 200 by 3/5.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nNumber of cat owners = (3/5) * 200\n\nFirst, I'll divide 200 by 5, which is 40. Then, multiply 40 by 3, which gives 120.\n\nSo, 120 people own cats.\n\nNow, to find out how many people do not own cats, I can subtract the number of cat owners from the total population.\n\nNumber of people who do not own cats = Total population - Number of cat owners\n\nNumber of people who do not own cats = 200 - 120 = 80\n\nTherefore, 80 people in the town do not own cats.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by thinking in terms of percentages?\n\nLet me see. If 3 out of 5 people own cats, that's the same as saying 60% of the people own cats because 3 divided by 5 is 0.6, which is 60%.\n\nSo, 60% own cats, which means that 40% do not own cats, since 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nThen, to find 40% of 200, I can calculate 0.4 * 200, which also gives 80.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio directly. The ratio of cat owners to total people is 3:5, so the ratio of non-cat owners to total people is 2:5.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-cat owners is (2/5) * 200, which again is 80.\n\nAll these different approaches confirm that the number of people who do not own cats is 80.\n\nI think that's the answer: 80 people do not own cats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
