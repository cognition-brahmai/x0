Since the question is about a specific event, it's likely that this information is widely available online.\n\n:E1: = DuckDuckGo[\"first manned mission to Mars\"]\n\nPlan: Review the search results from DuckDuckGo to find credible sources that discuss the landing date and the astronauts involved. Look for sources like NASA's official website, scientific journals, or well-known news outlets.\n\n:E2: = AIAnswerer[\"From the search results in :E1:, identify the most credible sources that provide information about the first manned mission to Mars, including the landing date and the names of the astronauts.\"]\n\nPlan: Once credible sources are identified, use the WebsiteReader tool to extract the relevant information from these sources. This will help in getting detailed and accurate data about the mission.\n\n:E3: = WebsiteReader[:E2:]\n\nPlan: Analyze the text obtained from the websites to extract the specific details required: the landing date and the names of the astronauts.
