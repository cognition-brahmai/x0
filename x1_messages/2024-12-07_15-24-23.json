        "content": "Is this a trivia question? It seems like you're asking about a specific U.S. state that is renowned for both its potato production and a notable ski resort called Sun Valley. Let me think about this.\n\nI know that Idaho is famous for its potatoes; in fact, it's often referred to as the \"Potato State.\" But is Sun Valley located in Idaho? I think so. I've heard of Sun Valley before, and I believe it's a popular ski destination.\n\nLet me verify this. Sun Valley is indeed located in Idaho. It's in Blaine County and is known for its world-class ski resort, Sun Valley Resort. So, if you're looking for a U.S. state known for potatoes and home to Sun Valley ski resort, it's Idaho.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there are other states that produce a lot of potatoes and have famous ski resorts. For example, Maine is known for its potatoes too, but I don't think it's as famous for potatoes as Idaho is. And as for ski resorts, while Maine has some, none are as renowned as Sun Valley.\n\nAnother state is Alaska; it produces potatoes, but again, it's not as famous for them as Idaho. And Sun Valley isn't in Alaska, as far as I know.\n\nThen there's California, which has a diverse agriculture industry, including potatoes, and has several ski resorts. However, Sun Valley isn't in California.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion with Sun Valley being in a different state. Let me check that again. According to my knowledge, Sun Valley is in Idaho.\n\nSo, to confirm, Idaho is known for its potatoes and is home to the prestigious Sun Valley ski resort.\n\nBut maybe there's more to this question. Is there another state that fits this description? Let's consider some other states.\n\nOregon produces potatoes and has ski resorts like Mt. Bachelor, but Sun Valley isn't in Oregon.\n\nWashington state also has potato production and ski resorts like Snoqualmie Summit, but again, Sun Valley isn't there.\n\nSo, it seems like Idaho is the correct answer here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trickier and is trying to hint at another state. But based on my knowledge, Idaho is the state that fits both criteria: famous for potatoes and home to Sun Valley ski resort.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to see if I know that Sun Valley is in Idaho. Well, I do know that now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different state that has a Sun Valley ski resort that I'm not aware of. But after checking, Sun Valley is indeed in Idaho.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the U.S. state known for its potatoes and famous for its Sun Valley ski resort is Idaho.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Idaho}} \\]"
