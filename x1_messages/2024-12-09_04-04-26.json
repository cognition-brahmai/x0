Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the formula to calculate distance is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nYou've got the speed: 45 miles per hour. And the time: 2 hours and 30 minutes. But wait, the units need to match. Speed is in miles per hour, so time should be in hours.\n\nNow, 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2.5 hours, right? Because 30 minutes is half an hour, so 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\nDistance = 45 miles/hour \u00d7 2.5 hours\n\nNow, multiplying those together:\n\n45 \u00d7 2.5\n\nLet me do the math here. 45 times 2 is 90, and 45 times 0.5 is 22.5. So, 90 plus 22.5 is 112.5.\n\nTherefore, you would travel 112.5 miles.\n\nBut, just to double-check, let's think about it another way. In one hour, you cover 45 miles. So in 2 hours, you'd cover 90 miles. Then, in half an hour, you'd cover half of 45 miles, which is 22.5 miles. Adding those up: 90 + 22.5 equals 112.5 miles.\n\nYep, that matches. So, the answer should be 112.5 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to work with fractions, 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2.5 hours, which is the same as 5/2 hours. So:\n\nDistance = 45 \u00d7 (5/2) = (45 \u00d7 5)/2 = 225/2 = 112.5 miles\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, it seems like you'll travel 112.5 miles.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this. Suppose you want to break it down by minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 30 minutes, totaling 150 minutes.\n\nYour speed is 45 miles per hour, which is 45 miles per 60 minutes. So, per minute, that's 45/60 miles.\n\nSimplify 45/60: both divisible by 15, so 3/4 miles per minute.\n\nSo, in 150 minutes, distance would be 150 \u00d7 (3/4) miles.\n\nCalculate that: 150 \u00d7 0.75 = 112.5 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems no matter which way you approach it, you end up with 112.5 miles.\n\nIs there any possibility that this could be wrong? Well, if the speed wasn't constant, but since the question says \"average speed of 45 miles per hour,\" we can assume that's the overall average speed for the entire journey.\n\nAlso, we're not considering any stops or variations in speed due to traffic et cetera, as the question doesn't mention any such factors.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the distance traveled is 112.5 miles.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's consider the definition of average speed. Average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, rearranging that, total distance equals average speed multiplied by total time.\n\nWe have average speed (45 mph) and total time (2.5 hours), so distance = 45 \u00d7 2.5 = 112.5 miles.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nAlternatively, if you wanted to use the formula for distance in terms of speed and time, which is d = s \u00d7 t, again, it's the same calculation.\n\nI think we can confidently say that the distance traveled is 112.5 miles.\n\nNow, if the question had provided different units, we might need to convert them, but in this case, everything is consistent in miles and hours, so no conversion is necessary.\n\nOne more thing to consider: sometimes, people might get confused with the units, but here, since we're dealing with miles per hour and hours, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, final answer: 112.5 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112.5} \\]"
