        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer has 120 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular field, and I need to find out what the maximum area he can enclose is. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that for a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all four sides. So, if the rectangle has a length of L meters and a width of W meters, the perimeter P would be:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nI'm given that the total fencing is 120 meters, so P = 120 meters. So, I can write:\n\n2L + 2W = 120\n\nI can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nL + W = 60\n\nAlright, so L + W = 60. Now, I need to find the maximum area that can be enclosed. The area A of a rectangle is given by:\n\nA = L * W\n\nSo, I have A = L * W, and from the perimeter equation, I have L + W = 60. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other to substitute into the area formula.\n\nLet's solve for L in terms of W from the perimeter equation:\n\nL = 60 - W\n\nNow, substitute this into the area formula:\n\nA = (60 - W) * W\n\nA = 60W - W\u00b2\n\nSo, the area A is equal to 60W - W\u00b2. This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of W, and it's in the form of A = -W\u00b2 + 60W.\n\nI recall that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of W\u00b2 is negative, this parabola opens downwards, which means it has a maximum point. That maximum point should correspond to the maximum area.\n\nTo find the maximum point of a parabola given by A = -W\u00b2 + 60W, I can use the vertex formula. The vertex of a parabola given by f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c occurs at x = -b/(2a).\n\nIn this case, a = -1 and b = 60, so:\n\nW = -60 / (2 * -1) = 30\n\nSo, the width W that maximizes the area is 30 meters. Now, plugging this back into the equation for L:\n\nL = 60 - W = 60 - 30 = 30 meters\n\nWait a minute, so both L and W are 30 meters? That would make the rectangle a square. Is that right?\n\nLet me check again. If L = 30 and W = 30, then the perimeter is 2*30 + 2*30 = 120 meters, which matches the given fencing. And the area would be 30*30 = 900 square meters.\n\nBut is this really the maximum area possible? Maybe I should try some other values to see.\n\nSuppose I choose W = 20 meters, then L = 60 - 20 = 40 meters. The area would be 20*40 = 800 square meters, which is less than 900.\n\nWhat if W = 40 meters, then L = 60 - 40 = 20 meters. Area is still 40*20 = 800 square meters.\n\nWhat about W = 25 meters, then L = 60 - 25 = 35 meters. Area is 25*35 = 875 square meters, which is still less than 900.\n\nAnd if W = 35 meters, then L = 60 - 35 = 25 meters. Area is same as above, 35*25 = 875 square meters.\n\nSeems like 30 meters for both length and width gives the maximum area of 900 square meters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider W = 29 meters, then L = 60 - 29 = 31 meters. Area is 29*31 = 899 square meters, which is less than 900.\n\nW = 31 meters, L = 60 - 31 = 29 meters. Area same as above, 31*29 = 899 square meters.\n\nW = 30.5 meters, L = 60 - 30.5 = 29.5 meters. Area is 30.5*29.5 = let's calculate that.\n\n30.5 * 29.5.\n\n30 * 30 = 900\n\nThen, 30 * (-0.5) = -15\n\n29.5 * 0.5 = 14.75\n\nSo, 900 - 15 + 14.75 = 900 - 0.25 = 899.75 square meters.\n\nStill less than 900.\n\nSimilarly, W = 29.5 meters, L = 30.5 meters. Area same as above, 29.5*30.5 = 899.75 square meters.\n\nSo, it seems like the maximum area is indeed 900 square meters when both length and width are 30 meters.\n\nWait a second, this is interesting. So, a square gives the maximum area for a given perimeter. Is that a general rule?\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose I have a fixed perimeter, say P = 120 meters, and I want to enclose a rectangle with maximum area. According to this, the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square.\n\nIs this always true? Let's test it with different perimeters.\n\nSuppose P = 100 meters.\n\nThen, L + W = 50 meters.\n\nSo, L = 50 - W.\n\nArea A = L * W = (50 - W) * W = 50W - W\u00b2.\n\nAgain, this is a quadratic equation with maximum at W = 25 meters, L = 25 meters, and A = 625 square meters.\n\nIf I choose W = 20 meters, L = 30 meters, A = 600 square meters, which is less than 625.\n\nSimilarly, for P = 80 meters, L + W = 40 meters.\n\nMaximum at W = 20 meters, L = 20 meters, A = 400 square meters.\n\nAny other dimensions give less area.\n\nSo, it seems that for a rectangle with a given perimeter, the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square.\n\nThat's interesting. So, in general, for a rectangle with perimeter P, the side lengths that maximize the area are L = W = P/4.\n\nIn this case, P = 120 meters, so L = W = 120/4 = 30 meters, and A = 30*30 = 900 square meters.\n\nBut is there a mathematical proof for this?\n\nWell, going back to the area formula A = L * W, subject to 2L + 2W = P.\n\nFrom the perimeter equation, L + W = P/2.\n\nSo, L = P/2 - W.\n\nSubstitute into the area formula:\n\nA = (P/2 - W) * W = P/2 * W - W\u00b2.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of W: A = -W\u00b2 + (P/2)W.\n\nThe graph of this equation is a parabola that opens downwards (since the coefficient of W\u00b2 is negative), so its maximum value occurs at the vertex.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola given by f(W) = aW\u00b2 + bW + c is at W = -b/(2a).\n\nHere, a = -1, b = P/2, so W = -(P/2) / (2*(-1)) = (P/2)/2 = P/4.\n\nThen, L = P/2 - W = P/2 - P/4 = P/4.\n\nSo, L = W = P/4, which is a square.\n\nTherefore, for a given perimeter, the rectangle with maximum area is a square.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use calculus to find the maximum area.\n\nStarting with A = L * W, subject to 2L + 2W = P.\n\nFrom the perimeter equation, L + W = P/2, so L = P/2 - W.\n\nSubstitute into A:\n\nA = (P/2 - W) * W = P/2 * W - W\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum area, take the derivative of A with respect to W and set it to zero.\n\ndA/dW = P/2 - 2W.\n\nSet dA/dW = 0:\n\nP/2 - 2W = 0\n\n2W = P/2\n\nW = P/4.\n\nThen, L = P/2 - P/4 = P/4.\n\nSo again, L = W = P/4, which is a square.\n\nAnd the second derivative d\u00b2A/dW\u00b2 = -2, which is negative, confirming that this is a maximum.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square.\n\nSo, in this problem, with P = 120 meters, the side length is L = W = 120/4 = 30 meters, and the maximum area is 30*30 = 900 square meters.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other shape that could give a larger area with the same perimeter.\n\nI know that among all shapes with a given perimeter, the circle has the maximum area. But in this problem, it's specified that the field is rectangular, so I have to stick with rectangles.\n\nStill, for comparison, if I were to enclose a circular field with a perimeter of 120 meters, the circumference C = 120 meters.\n\nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius.\n\nSo, r = C/(2\u03c0) = 120/(2\u03c0) = 60/\u03c0 meters.\n\nThen, the area A of the circle is \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*(60/\u03c0)\u00b2 = \u03c0*(3600/\u03c0\u00b2) = 3600/\u03c0 \u2248 1145.92 square meters.\n\nThat's larger than the 900 square meters for the square.\n\nBut again, since the problem specifies a rectangular field, we have to go with the square shape for the maximum area among rectangles.\n\nAlternatively, if the farmer were allowed to choose any shape, the circle would give the maximum area.\n\nBut in this case, it's rectangular, so the maximum area is 900 square meters.\n\nWait, but is there any other way to maximize the area with a rectangle?\n\nWhat if the rectangle is not a square? Would the area be less, as I saw in the earlier examples?\n\nYes, as I tested earlier, if W = 20, L = 40, A = 800; if W = 25, L = 35, A = 875; if W = 30, L = 30, A = 900.\n\nSo, indeed, the square gives the maximum area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to arrange the fencing in a different way to get more area, but within the constraints of a rectangle, I don't think so.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other constraints in the problem, like whether the field needs to be against a wall or anything like that, but the problem just says to enclose a rectangular field with 120 meters of fencing.\n\nSo, I think the answer is that the maximum area is 900 square meters.\n\nBut to be completely sure, let's consider the general case.\n\nFor any perimeter P, the maximum area of a rectangle is (P/4)^2.\n\nIn this case, P = 120 meters, so (120/4)^2 = 30^2 = 900 square meters.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to use the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM inequality).\n\nFor two positive numbers L and W, the AM-GM inequality states that:\n\n(L + W)/2 >= sqrt(L * W)\n\nWith equality if and only if L = W.\n\nGiven that L + W = 60 meters, then:\n\n60/2 >= sqrt(L * W)\n\n30 >= sqrt(A)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n900 >= A\n\nSo, the maximum possible area is 900 square meters, achieved when L = W = 30 meters.\n\nThat's another way to confirm the result.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area that can be enclosed is 900 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
