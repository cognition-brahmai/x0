        "content": "The famous equation developed by Albert Einstein that expresses the relationship between mass and energy is E=mc\u00b2. This equation shows that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared. It demonstrates that mass and energy are interchangeable and fundamental aspects of the same thing."
