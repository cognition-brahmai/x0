        "content": "Let's see here. We have two trains, one leaving Station A at 60 miles per hour and the other leaving Station B at 80 miles per hour, and they're heading towards each other on the same track. The distance between Station A and Station B is 420 miles. We need to find out how long it will take for them to collide.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what's happening here. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other. That makes sense because they're approaching each other.\n\nSo, the speed of the first train is 60 mph, and the second train is 80 mph. If they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. That would be 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nNow, the distance between them is 420 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 420 miles, and the relative speed is 140 mph.\n\nSo, Time = 420 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n420 divided by 140 is 3.\n\nSo, the time it takes for the trains to collide is 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the first train is going at 60 mph for 3 hours, it would cover 180 miles.\n\nThe second train is going at 80 mph for 3 hours, covering 240 miles.\n\nTogether, they cover 180 + 240 = 420 miles, which is the distance between the two stations.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up to 140 mph, and the distance is 420 miles. So, time is indeed 420 / 140 = 3 hours.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
