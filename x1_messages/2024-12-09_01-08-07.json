        "content": "So there's this box with fruits, right? It has 15 apples and 10 oranges. I need to find out the probability of picking an apple without looking. Okay, probability is basically about finding out the chances of something happening. In this case, the chance of picking an apple.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of fruits in the box. There are 15 apples and 10 oranges, so total fruits would be 15 + 10, which is 25 fruits.\n\nNow, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the favorable outcome is picking an apple, and the total possible outcomes are picking any fruit from the box.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of apples, which is 15. And the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of fruits, which is 25.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of picking an apple is P = number of apples / total number of fruits = 15 / 25.\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5, which gives P = 3 / 5.\n\nTo express this as a decimal, I can divide 3 by 5, which is 0.6.\n\nAlternatively, probability can also be expressed as a percentage, so 0.6 is equivalent to 60%.\n\nSo, there's a 60% chance of picking an apple from the box.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 15 apples and 10 oranges, totaling 25 fruits, and I divide 15 by 25, yes, that's 0.6, which is 60%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is, for every 25 fruits I pick, 15 of them are apples. So, the ratio of apples to total fruits is 15:25, which simplifies to 3:5, meaning 3 out of every 5 fruits are apples.\n\nThat makes sense. I can also consider it in terms of percentages. 15 out of 25 is the same as 60 out of 100, which is 60%.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe using combinations. The number of ways to choose 1 apple from 15 apples is C(15,1), and the total number of ways to choose any 1 fruit from 25 fruits is C(25,1). So, the probability is C(15,1)/C(25,1) = 15/25 = 3/5, which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages right from the start. Apples make up 15 out of 25 fruits. To find the percentage, (15/25)*100 = 60%.\n\nOr, decimal form: 15 divided by 25 is 0.6.\n\nSo, all these methods lead to the same conclusion: the probability is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\nI think I've covered it from different angles and the answer remains consistent. So, I'm confident that the probability of picking an apple is 3/5 or 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
