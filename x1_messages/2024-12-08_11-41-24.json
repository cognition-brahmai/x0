        "content": "So the man starts with a jar containing 50 white marbles and 50 black marbles. Then he adds 25 more white marbles to the jar. We need to find out the probability that he will draw a white marble from the jar now.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total number of marbles in the jar after adding the 25 white marbles.\n\nInitially, there are 50 white marbles and 50 black marbles, so the total is:\n\n50 (white) + 50 (black) = 100 marbles.\n\nThen he adds 25 more white marbles, so the new total number of marbles is:\n\n100 (original) + 25 (added white) = 125 marbles.\n\nNow, let's find out how many of these marbles are white.\n\nInitially, there were 50 white marbles, and he added 25 more, so:\n\n50 + 25 = 75 white marbles.\n\nSo, there are 75 white marbles out of a total of 125 marbles.\n\nThe probability of drawing a white marble is the number of white marbles divided by the total number of marbles.\n\nSo, probability P = 75 / 125.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 25:\n\n75 \u00f7 25 = 3\n\n125 \u00f7 25 = 5\n\nSo, P = 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal:\n\n3 \u00f7 5 = 0.6\n\nOr as a percentage:\n\n0.6 \u00d7 100% = 60%\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a white marble is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
