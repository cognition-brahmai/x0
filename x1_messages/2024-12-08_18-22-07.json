        "content": "So I have this problem here. There's a rectangular garden that measures 30 feet by 40 feet, and the gardener wants to create a walking path around it that's 4 feet wide. I need to find out the area of this walking path. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. There's a rectangle that's 30 feet by 40 feet, which is the garden. Now, around this garden, there's going to be a path that's 4 feet wide all around the garden. So, the path is like a border around the garden.\n\nTo find the area of just the path, I think one way is to find the total area including the garden and the path, and then subtract the area of the garden itself. That should give me the area of the path.\n\nLet me try that. First, I need to find the dimensions of the entire area, including the garden and the path.\n\nSince the path is 4 feet wide all around, it means that it adds 4 feet to each side of the garden. So, on each side of the garden, the path extends 4 feet out.\n\nWait a minute, since the path is around all sides, I need to add 4 feet to both sides for each dimension.\n\nLet me clarify: for the length, which is 40 feet, the path adds 4 feet on one end and 4 feet on the other end, so that's a total addition of 8 feet to the length.\n\nSimilarly, for the width, which is 30 feet, the path adds 4 feet on one side and 4 feet on the other side, so again, 8 feet added to the width.\n\nTherefore, the total length including the path would be 40 feet + 8 feet = 48 feet.\n\nAnd the total width including the path would be 30 feet + 8 feet = 38 feet.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nIf the garden is 40 feet long, and the path is 4 feet wide on both ends, then the total length should be:\n\n40 feet (garden) + 4 feet (one side) + 4 feet (other side) = 48 feet.\n\nSimilarly, for the width:\n\n30 feet (garden) + 4 feet (one side) + 4 feet (other side) = 38 feet.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the area including the garden and the path would be:\n\nTotal area = length \u00d7 width = 48 feet \u00d7 38 feet.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n48 \u00d7 38.\n\nI can compute that as:\n\n48 \u00d7 40 = 1920\n\nBut then I have to subtract 48 \u00d7 2 (since 38 is 40 - 2):\n\n48 \u00d7 2 = 96\n\nSo, 1920 - 96 = 1824 square feet.\n\nAlternatively, I can multiply 48 \u00d7 38 directly:\n\n40 \u00d7 30 = 1200\n\n40 \u00d7 8 = 320\n\n8 \u00d7 30 = 240\n\n8 \u00d7 8 = 64\n\nAdding those up: 1200 + 320 = 1520, plus 240 is 1760, plus 64 is 1824 square feet.\n\nOkay, so the total area is 1824 square feet.\n\nNow, the area of the garden itself is 30 feet \u00d7 40 feet = 1200 square feet.\n\nSo, to find the area of the path, I subtract the garden area from the total area:\n\n1824 sq ft - 1200 sq ft = 624 sq ft.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to approach this to confirm?\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the area of the path directly.\n\nSince the path is 4 feet wide around the garden, I can think of it as consisting of two parts: the path along the length and the path along the width.\n\nBut actually, it's a bit more complicated because the path goes around the entire garden, forming a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the path as a larger rectangle minus the garden rectangle.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the area of the path by considering it as consisting of two pairs of rectangles: two longer rectangles along the length of the garden and two shorter rectangles along the width, plus the four corner areas.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and I might make mistakes in adding up all those areas.\n\nLet me see: the path is 4 feet wide, so the two longer rectangles would each be 40 feet long and 4 feet wide, and the two shorter rectangles would each be 30 feet long and 4 feet wide.\n\nBut wait, that would only account for the sides, not the corners.\n\nActually, if I add those up, I get:\n\n2 \u00d7 (40 ft \u00d7 4 ft) + 2 \u00d7 (30 ft \u00d7 4 ft) = 2 \u00d7 160 sq ft + 2 \u00d7 120 sq ft = 320 sq ft + 240 sq ft = 560 sq ft.\n\nBut earlier, I got 624 sq ft, which is different from 560 sq ft.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. So, I must be missing something.\n\nAh, I see. The issue is that when I add the areas of the side rectangles, I'm double-counting the corner areas where the paths intersect.\n\nEach corner is a square of 4 ft by 4 ft, so each corner is 16 square feet.\n\nSince there are four corners, that's 4 \u00d7 16 sq ft = 64 sq ft.\n\nSo, in the previous calculation, I need to add these corner areas to the total.\n\nTherefore, 560 sq ft + 64 sq ft = 624 sq ft, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nOkay, that makes sense now.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 624 square feet.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nI could also think of the path as a frame around the garden.\n\nThe area of the frame would be the total area minus the garden area, which is what I did initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the path as consisting of a long rectangle around the garden, with varying widths, but that seems more complicated.\n\nAnother way is to consider that the path forms a larger rectangle around the garden, and the difference in area between the larger rectangle and the garden is the path area.\n\nWhich is essentially what I did first.\n\nSo, all these approaches lead me to the same answer: 624 square feet.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the area of the walking path is 624 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{624} \\]"
