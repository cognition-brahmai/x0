        "content": "So the factory produces 1000 units of product A and 2000 units of product B each day. For each unit of product A, they need 3 workers, and for each unit of product B, they need 2 workers. I need to find out how many workers the factory needs in total to operate at full capacity.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of workers needed for product A. Since each unit of product A requires 3 workers, and they produce 1000 units per day, I can multiply the number of units by the number of workers per unit:\n\nWorkers for product A = 1000 units * 3 workers/unit = 3000 workers\n\nNext, for product B, each unit requires 2 workers, and they produce 2000 units per day. So, similarly:\n\nWorkers for product B = 2000 units * 2 workers/unit = 4000 workers\n\nNow, to find the total number of workers needed, I just add the workers for product A and product B together:\n\nTotal workers = workers for A + workers for B = 3000 + 4000 = 7000 workers\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's any overlap in the workers or if some workers are shared between the production of product A and product B. The problem doesn't mention anything about workers being shared, so I'll assume that the workers for each product are distinct.\n\nAlso, perhaps the factory has some workers who are involved in both production lines, but again, since it's not specified, I'll stick with the initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the workers are used in shifts, but the question is about the number needed to operate at full capacity, so probably it's the total number of workers required per day.\n\nSo, my final answer is 7000 workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7000} \\]"
