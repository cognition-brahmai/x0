        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the car is traveling at 60 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find out how far it goes in that time, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nThen, the car slows down to 40 miles per hour for another 3 hours. Using the same formula:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 40 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, we just add the two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 240 miles + 120 miles = 360 miles\n\nSo, the car has traveled a total of 360 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
