        "content": "Certainly! Below is a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the second smallest and second largest numbers from that array. I've included comments to explain each step for clarity.\n\n```javascript\nfunction findSecondLowestAndSecondGreatest(numbers) {\n    // First, we need to handle edge cases where the array is too small.\n    if (numbers.length < 2) {\n        throw new Error(\"Array must contain at least two elements.\");\n    }\n\n    // Sort the array in ascending order.\n    numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n    // After sorting, the second element is the second smallest.\n    const secondSmallest = numbers[1];\n\n    // The second largest is the second last element.\n    const secondLargest = numbers[numbers.length - 2];\n\n    // Return both values in an object for clarity.\n    return {\n        secondSmallest: secondSmallest,\n        secondLargest: secondLargest\n    };\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\nconst result = findSecondLowestAndSecondGreatest(nums);\nconsole.log(result); // Output: { secondSmallest: 20, secondLargest: 40 }\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Edge Case Handling:** The function first checks if the array has at least two elements. If not, it throws an error because it's impossible to find the second smallest and second largest in such cases.\n\n2. **Sorting the Array:** The array is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method with a comparator function to ensure numerical sorting.\n\n3. **Finding the Second Smallest and Second Largest:**\n   - The second smallest number is directly accessed at index 1 of the sorted array.\n   - The second largest number is accessed at index `numbers.length - 2` of the sorted array.\n\n4. **Returning the Results:** The function returns an object containing both the second smallest and second largest numbers for clarity.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is straightforward and efficient for finding the required values."
