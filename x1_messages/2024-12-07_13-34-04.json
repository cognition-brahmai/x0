        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a box with red and blue balls, and when we draw two balls at random without replacement, the probability of getting two red balls is 1/2. We need to find the smallest possible total number of balls in the box.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- \\( r \\) is the number of red balls.\n\n- \\( b \\) is the number of blue balls.\n\n- \\( t = r + b \\) is the total number of balls.\n\nThe probability of drawing two red balls without replacement is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{two red balls}) = \\frac{\\text{number of ways to choose two red balls}}{\\text{total number of ways to choose any two balls}} = \\frac{\\binom{r}{2}}{\\binom{t}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{r(r-1)}{2}}{\\frac{t(t-1)}{2}} = \\frac{r(r-1)}{t(t-1)}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this probability is 1/2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r(r-1)}{t(t-1)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n\\[\n2r(r-1) = t(t-1)\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible \\( t \\) such that this equation holds for some positive integers \\( r \\) and \\( b \\), with \\( r + b = t \\) and \\( r \\geq 2 \\) (since we're drawing two red balls).\n\nThis seems like a Diophantine equation, and solving it might require finding integer solutions. Let's try to express \\( t \\) in terms of \\( r \\):\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n\\[\n2r(r-1) = t(t-1)\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic in \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nt^2 - t - 2r(r-1) = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8r(r-1)}}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( t \\) to be an integer, the discriminant \\( 1 + 8r(r-1) \\) must be a perfect square. Let\u2019s denote the discriminant as \\( d \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8r(r-1)\n\\]\n\nWe need \\( d \\) to be a perfect square. Let\u2019s try plugging in small integer values for \\( r \\) to see when \\( d \\) becomes a perfect square.\n\nStart with \\( r = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1 + 16 = 17 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 1 + 48 = 49 \\quad (\\text{which is } 7^2)\n\\]\n\nOkay, so for \\( r = 3 \\), \\( d = 49 \\), which is a perfect square. Let's plug this back into the equation for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm 7}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two possible solutions:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1 + 7}{2} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = \\frac{1 - 7}{2} = -3\n\\]\n\nSince the number of balls can't be negative, \\( t = 4 \\).\n\nNow, let's check if this makes sense. If \\( t = 4 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\), then \\( b = 1 \\).\n\nThe probability of drawing two red balls is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\binom{3}{2}}{\\binom{4}{2}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the given probability. So, with \\( t = 4 \\), the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut the problem asks for the smallest possible number of balls, so we should check if there's a smaller \\( t \\) that also satisfies the condition.\n\nLet's try \\( r = 4 \\) to see what \\( t \\) we get.\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 1 + 96 = 97 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 1 + 160 = 161 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 1 + 240 = 241 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\nIt seems that \\( r = 3 \\) and \\( t = 4 \\) is the only small solution. But maybe there are larger solutions; let's try \\( r = 7 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 1 + 336 = 337 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 8 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 1 + 448 = 449 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 9 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 1 + 576 = 577 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 10 \\times 9 = 1 + 720 = 721 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 11 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 1 + 880 = 881 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 12 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 12 \\times 11 = 1 + 1056 = 1057 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 13 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 13 \\times 12 = 1 + 1248 = 1249 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 14 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 14 \\times 13 = 1 + 1456 = 1457 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n\\]\n\n\\( r = 15 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 15 \\times 14 = 1 + 1680 = 1681 \\quad (\\text{which is } 41^2)\n\\]\n\nAh, now we have another solution. For \\( r = 15 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1681 = 41^2\n\\]\n\nPlugging back into the equation for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1 \\pm 41}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1 + 41}{2} = 21 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = \\frac{1 - 41}{2} = -20 \\quad (\\text{invalid})\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 21 \\) is another possible total number of balls. With \\( r = 15 \\) and \\( t = 21 \\), the number of blue balls \\( b = 6 \\).\n\nLet's verify the probability:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\binom{15}{2}}{\\binom{21}{2}} = \\frac{105}{210} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhich again matches the given probability.\n\nSo, we have two possible total numbers of balls: 4 and 21. But the problem asks for the smallest possible number, which is 4.\n\nHowever, let's check if there are any smaller solutions than 4. We already tried \\( r = 2 \\), which didn't give an integer \\( t \\), and \\( r = 3 \\) gave \\( t = 4 \\). Let's see if \\( r = 1 \\) is possible.\n\nFor \\( r = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 1 + 8 \\times 1 \\times 0 = 1 + 0 = 1 = 1^2\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( d \\) is a perfect square. Plugging back:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1 \\pm 1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = \\frac{1 - 1}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\nBut \\( t = 1 \\) would mean there is only one ball, which can't satisfy drawing two balls, and \\( t = 0 \\) is invalid. So, \\( r = 1 \\) doesn't give a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible total number of balls is 4.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's see if there are any other small solutions.\n\nTrying \\( r = 4 \\) again, we saw that \\( d = 97 \\), which isn't a perfect square. Similarly, \\( r = 5 \\) gives \\( d = 161 \\), which isn't a perfect square.\n\nSo, indeed, the smallest possible total number of balls is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
