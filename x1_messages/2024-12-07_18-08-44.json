Below is a Python script that implements the merge sort algorithm to sort a list of strings alphabetically:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) > 1:\n        # Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n        left_half = arr[:mid]\n        right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n        # Recursively sort both halves\n        merge_sort(left_half)\n        merge_sort(right_half)\n\n        # Merge the sorted halves\n        i = j = k = 0\n        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):\n            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:\n                arr[k] = left_half[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                arr[k] = right_half[j]\n                j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Check if any element was left in the left half\n        while i < len(left_half):\n            arr[k] = left_half[i]\n            i += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Check if any element was left in the right half\n        while j < len(right_half):\n            arr[k] = right_half[j]\n            j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sample_list = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"blueberry\"]\n    print(\"Original list:\", sample_list)\n    merge_sort(sample_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sample_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Divide**: The `merge_sort` function splits the input array into two halves until each sub-array contains a single element.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each sub-array.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted sub-arrays back together to form a single sorted array.\n\nThe `merge_sort` function is called recursively on the left and right halves of the array, and then the merging process combines these halves in sorted order. This ensures that the entire list is sorted alphabetically."
