        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of friends who want to buy a $120 gift, and they're splitting the cost evenly among themselves. If three more people join, the cost per person decreases by $4. We need to find out how many people were originally in the group.\n\nLet's denote the original number of people in the group as \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, the original cost per person is the total cost divided by the number of people, which is \\( \\frac{120}{n} \\).\n\nNow, if three more people join, the number of people becomes \\( n + 3 \\), and the new cost per person is \\( \\frac{120}{n + 3} \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the new cost per person is $4 less than the original cost per person. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{n} - \\frac{120}{n + 3} = 4 \\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The common denominator of \\( n \\) and \\( n + 3 \\) is \\( n(n + 3) \\).\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120(n + 3) - 120n}{n(n + 3)} = 4 \\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[ 120(n + 3) - 120n = 120n + 360 - 120n = 360 \\]\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{360}{n(n + 3)} = 4 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the denominator, multiply both sides by \\( n(n + 3) \\):\n\n\\[ 360 = 4n(n + 3) \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ 90 = n(n + 3) \\]\n\nNow, expand the right side:\n\n\\[ 90 = n^2 + 3n \\]\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ n^2 + 3n - 90 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for \\( n \\). We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -90 \\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-90)}}{2(1)} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 360}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{369}}{2} \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\sqrt{369} \\) is approximately 19.21, since \\( 19^2 = 361 \\) and \\( 20^2 = 400 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-3 \\pm 19.21}{2} \\]\n\nFirst, consider the positive root:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-3 + 19.21}{2} = \\frac{16.21}{2} = 8.105 \\]\n\nSince the number of people must be a whole number, this isn't acceptable.\n\nNow, consider the negative root:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-3 - 19.21}{2} = \\frac{-22.21}{2} = -11.105 \\]\n\nNegative numbers of people don't make sense in this context.\n\nHmm, it seems like there's a mistake here because we're not getting a whole number for \\( n \\), which is necessary since people can't be divided.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ n^2 + 3n - 90 = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 360}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{369}}{2} \\]\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should check if 369 is a perfect square or if I've miscalculated something.\n\nLet me see, \\( 19^2 = 361 \\), \\( 20^2 = 400 \\), so \\( \\sqrt{369} \\) is indeed approximately 19.21, which doesn't give us a whole number for \\( n \\).\n\nMaybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet's try factoring the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ n^2 + 3n - 90 = 0 \\]\n\nWe need two numbers that multiply to \\( -90 \\) and add up to \\( 3 \\). Let's think:\n\nPossible factor pairs of -90:\n\n- 1 and -90\n\n- 2 and -45\n\n- 3 and -30\n\n- 5 and -18\n\n- 6 and -15\n\n- 9 and -10\n\n-1 and 90\n\n-2 and 45\n\n-3 and 30\n\n-5 and 18\n\n-6 and 15\n\n-9 and 10\n\nLooking for a pair that adds up to 3:\n\nLet's see:\n\n- 9 and -10: 9 + (-10) = -1, not 3\n\n- 10 and -9: 10 + (-9) = 1, not 3\n\n- 15 and -6: 15 + (-6) = 9, not 3\n\n- 18 and -5: 18 + (-5) = 13, not 3\n\n- 30 and -3: 30 + (-3) = 27, not 3\n\n- 45 and -2: 45 + (-2) = 43, not 3\n\n- 90 and -1: 90 + (-1) = 89, not 3\n\nHmm, none of these pairs add up to 3. That means I might have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me revisit the original problem.\n\nWe have:\n\nOriginal cost per person: \\( \\frac{120}{n} \\)\n\nNew cost per person: \\( \\frac{120}{n + 3} \\)\n\nThe difference is $4:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{n} - \\frac{120}{n + 3} = 4 \\]\n\nI think my initial setup was correct. Maybe I should try plugging in some whole number values for \\( n \\) to see if I can find a solution that makes sense.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{6} - \\frac{120}{6 + 3} = 20 - \\frac{120}{9} = 20 - 13.\\overline{3} = 6.\\overline{6} \\]\n\nThat's not equal to 4.\n\nTry \\( n = 7 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{7} - \\frac{120}{10} \\approx 17.1429 - 12 = 5.1429 \\]\n\nStill not 4.\n\nn = 8:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{8} - \\frac{120}{11} = 15 - 10.\\overline{9} \\approx 15 - 10.909 = 4.091 \\]\n\nThat's close to 4. Maybe n=8 is acceptable, considering rounding.\n\nBut in the quadratic solution, n was approximately 8.105, which is close to 8.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, originally, there were 8 people in the group.\n\nLet me verify this:\n\nOriginal cost per person: 120 / 8 = $15\n\nAfter 3 more people join: 8 + 3 = 11 people\n\nNew cost per person: 120 / 11 \u2248 $10.909\n\nDifference: 15 - 10.909 \u2248 4.091, which is approximately $4.\n\nGiven that we're dealing with money, which is typically rounded to two decimal places, this seems acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to get an exact whole number solution. Let me check the quadratic equation again.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ n^2 + 3n - 90 = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 360}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{369}}{2} \\]\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{369} \\) is not a perfect square, it confirms that the solution isn't a whole number.\n\nHowever, in the context of the problem, the number of people must be a whole number. It's possible that the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number, which would be 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my interpretation.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the total cost and the change in cost per person when three more people join.\n\nThe total cost is $120.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original number of people as \\( n \\).\n\nOriginal cost per person: \\( c = \\frac{120}{n} \\)\n\nAfter three more people join, number of people: \\( n + 3 \\)\n\nNew cost per person: \\( c - 4 = \\frac{120}{n + 3} \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{n} - 4 = \\frac{120}{n + 3} \\]\n\nWait a minute, this is a different way to set up the equation. Earlier, I set it up as \\( \\frac{120}{n} - \\frac{120}{n + 3} = 4 \\), assuming that the difference between the original and new cost per person is $4.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to set it up as \\( \\frac{120}{n} - 4 = \\frac{120}{n + 3} \\), meaning that the original cost per person minus $4 equals the new cost per person.\n\nActually, both equations are equivalent. Let me show that:\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{n} - 4 = \\frac{120}{n + 3} \\]\n\nThen, rearranging:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120}{n} - \\frac{120}{n + 3} = 4 \\]\n\nWhich is the same as my original equation.\n\nSo, I'm back to the same quadratic equation.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that the solution isn't a whole number, perhaps there's an error in the problem itself, or maybe it's expecting a non-integer solution, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the cost per person decreases by exactly $4, and see if there's a whole number solution that fits closely.\n\nFrom earlier, with n=8, the difference is approximately $4.091, which is slightly more than $4.\n\nIf n=9:\n\nOriginal cost per person: 120 / 9 \u2248 $13.333\n\nNew cost per person: 120 / 12 = $10\n\nDifference: 13.333 - 10 = $3.333, which is less than $4.\n\nSo, n=8 gives a difference closer to $4 than n=9.\n\nGiven that, and since n=8 gives a difference of approximately $4.091, which is closer to $4 than n=9's $3.333, it seems reasonable to conclude that the original number of people was 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there were originally 8 people in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
