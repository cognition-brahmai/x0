        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I'm tossing a fair coin 10 times, and I need to find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, since it's a fair coin, the probability of getting heads (H) on any single toss is 0.5, and the same for tails (T). Each toss is independent of the others, meaning the outcome of one toss doesn't affect the next.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 tosses. This sounds like a job for the binomial probability formula. The binomial distribution is used when there are exactly two mutually exclusive outcomes of a trial, in this case, heads or tails.\n\nThe formula for the binomial probability is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (tosses), which is 10.\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (heads), which is 6.\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on an individual trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin.\n\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \\( \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(6) = \\binom{10}{6} (0.5)^6 (0.5)^{10-6} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{10}{6} \\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{10}{6} = \\frac{10!}{6! \\cdot 4!} \\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n- \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3,628,800 \\)\n\n- \\( 6! = 720 \\)\n\n- \\( 4! = 24 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\binom{10}{6} = \\frac{3,628,800}{720 \\times 24} = \\frac{3,628,800}{17,280} = 210 \\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( (0.5)^6 \\) and \\( (0.5)^4 \\):\n\n\\[ (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \\]\n\n\\[ (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 \\]\n\nNow, multiply these together with the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[ P(6) = 210 \\times 0.015625 \\times 0.0625 \\]\n\nFirst, multiply \\( 210 \\times 0.015625 \\):\n\n\\[ 210 \\times 0.015625 = 3.28125 \\]\n\nThen, multiply that by 0.0625:\n\n\\[ 3.28125 \\times 0.0625 = 0.205078125 \\]\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 tosses is approximately 0.2051, or 20.51%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting again with the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[ \\binom{10}{6} = \\frac{10!}{6!4!} = \\frac{3,628,800}{720 \\times 24} = \\frac{3,628,800}{17,280} = 210 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, \\( (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \\) and \\( (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 \\). Multiplying these together:\n\n\\[ (0.5)^6 \\times (0.5)^4 = (0.5)^{10} = 0.0009765625 \\]\n\nBut according to the binomial formula, it's \\( \\binom{10}{6} \\times (0.5)^6 \\times (0.5)^4 \\), which is \\( 210 \\times 0.0009765625 \\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ 210 \\times 0.0009765625 = 0.205078125 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation. So, the probability is indeed approximately 0.2051, or 20.51%.\n\nAlternatively, since the coin is fair, the probability of getting heads or tails is equal, so the distribution should be symmetric. That means the probability of getting 6 heads should be the same as getting 4 heads, and so on.\n\nLet me verify this using the binomial probability formula for \\( k = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ P(4) = \\binom{10}{4} (0.5)^4 (0.5)^6 \\]\n\nCalculate \\( \\binom{10}{4} \\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{10}{4} = \\frac{10!}{4!6!} = \\frac{3,628,800}{24 \\times 720} = \\frac{3,628,800}{17,280} = 210 \\]\n\nSame as \\( \\binom{10}{6} \\), which makes sense because \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k} \\).\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ P(4) = 210 \\times (0.5)^4 \\times (0.5)^6 = 210 \\times 0.0625 \\times 0.015625 = 210 \\times 0.0009765625 = 0.205078125 \\]\n\nSo, indeed, \\( P(4) = P(6) \\), as expected.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, since \\( n \\) is reasonably large and \\( p = 0.5 \\). The normal approximation has mean \\( np = 5 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sqrt{np(1-p)} = \\sqrt{2.5} \\approx 1.5811 \\).\n\nUsing the continuity correction, to find \\( P(X = 6) \\), we can approximate it as \\( P(5.5 < X < 6.5) \\) in the normal distribution.\n\nBut given that the exact binomial calculation is straightforward, the normal approximation isn't necessary here, and it's better to stick with the exact method.\n\nSo, concluding, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 tosses of a fair coin is approximately 0.2051, or 20.51%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2051} \\]"
