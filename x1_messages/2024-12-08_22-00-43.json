While I can't provide specific figures, I can give you an overview of how travel prices in Europe have generally changed since the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1990s, travel in Europe was significantly different from what it is today. The cost of travel has been influenced by various factors over the years, including economic changes, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.\n\nOne major factor that has impacted travel prices is the introduction and expansion of low-cost carriers (LCCs). Airlines like Ryanair and easyJet revolutionized European aviation by offering inexpensive fares, making air travel more accessible to a broader segment of the population. This increased competition put pressure on traditional carriers to lower their prices or offer more competitive services.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of online booking platforms and travel agencies has made it easier for consumers to compare prices and find the best deals. This increased transparency has likely contributed to downward pressure on prices.\n\nOn the other hand, factors such as fuel costs, airport taxes, and security measures have also influenced travel expenses. For instance, fluctuations in oil prices can affect airline ticket costs, while increased security requirements may lead to higher fees.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the cost of travel can vary significantly depending on the mode of transportation, destination, and time of year. For example, traveling during peak seasons or to popular tourist destinations may still command higher prices.\n\nOverall, while it's challenging to generalize the exact changes in travel prices across Europe since the 1990s, it's safe to say that advancements in technology, increased competition, and greater accessibility have likely led to more affordable travel options for many.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need more detailed information, feel free to ask!"
