        "content": "Alright, so the car rental company wants to add electric vehicles (EVs) to its fleet over the next five years. They currently have 1,000 gasoline-powered cars and plan to replace 20% of them with EVs by the end of the fifth year. Each EV costs $40,000, and the company expects to save $5,000 per year on fuel and maintenance costs compared to a gasoline-powered car. I need to calculate the total investment required for this transition and the expected savings after five years.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many EVs the company plans to add. They want to replace 20% of their 1,000 gasoline-powered cars with EVs. So, 20% of 1,000 is:\n\n0.20 * 1,000 = 200 EVs\n\nSo, they plan to add 200 EVs to their fleet.\n\nNext, each EV costs $40,000. Therefore, the total investment required for purchasing these EVs is:\n\n200 EVs * $40,000 per EV = $8,000,000\n\nThat's the total investment needed to buy the EVs.\n\nNow, regarding the savings. The company expects to save $5,000 per year on fuel and maintenance costs for each EV compared to a gasoline-powered car. Since they're replacing 200 cars with EVs, the annual savings would be:\n\n200 EVs * $5,000 per year per EV = $1,000,000 per year\n\nThat's the annual savings. But we need to find out the total savings after five years. So, over five years, the total savings would be:\n\n$1,000,000 per year * 5 years = $5,000,000\n\nSo, the total investment required is $8,000,000, and the expected savings after five years are $5,000,000.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's more to this. Is there any other cost or savings that I might have missed? For example, maybe there are additional costs associated with charging infrastructure or maintenance that isn't covered here. But based on the information provided, I think this is what's expected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company is replacing the cars gradually over the five years, not all at once. The problem says they plan to add EVs \"over the next five years\" and replace 20% \"by the end of the fifth year.\" So, it might be that they're adding the EVs incrementally each year, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's acceptable to assume they're adding all 200 EVs at once, perhaps spread out over the five years, but without more details, I'll proceed with the initial calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the time value of money, but since this is a straightforward calculation without mentioning discount rates or inflation, I think it's fine to keep it simple.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nTotal investment: 200 EVs * $40,000 = $8,000,000\n\nAnnual savings: 200 EVs * $5,000 = $1,000,000 per year\n\nTotal savings over five years: $1,000,000 * 5 = $5,000,000\n\nTherefore, the company will invest $8,000,000 and expect to save $5,000,000 over five years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total investment required for the transition is \\boxed{8000000} dollars, and the expected savings after five years are \\boxed{5000000} dollars."
