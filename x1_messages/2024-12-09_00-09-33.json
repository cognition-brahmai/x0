        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box with red and blue balls, total of 36 balls. The probability of picking a red ball is 1/3. I need to find out how many blue balls there are. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of outcomes. In this case, the probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, and the total number of balls is 36. So, the number of red balls should be 1/3 of the total number of balls.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of red balls = (1/3) * total number of balls\n\nNumber of red balls = (1/3) * 36\n\nNumber of red balls = 12\n\nAlright, so there are 12 red balls. Now, since the box only contains red and blue balls, the rest must be blue balls. So, to find the number of blue balls, I can subtract the number of red balls from the total number of balls.\n\nNumber of blue balls = total number of balls - number of red balls\n\nNumber of blue balls = 36 - 12\n\nNumber of blue balls = 24\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If there are 12 red balls and 24 blue balls, that adds up to 36, which matches the total. Now, let's check the probability.\n\nProbability of picking a red ball = number of red balls / total number of balls\n\nProbability = 12 / 36 = 1/3\n\nThat matches the given probability. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Suppose I let the number of red balls be R and the number of blue balls be B. I know that R + B = 36, and R / 36 = 1/3.\n\nFrom the second equation, R = 36 * (1/3) = 12, which is the same as before. Then B = 36 - 12 = 24.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of ratios. The probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, which means that for every 3 balls, 1 is red and 2 are blue. So, the ratio of red to blue is 1:2.\n\nGiven that, I can divide the total number of balls into parts. If red is 1 part and blue is 2 parts, then total parts are 3. So, each part represents 36 / 3 = 12 balls.\n\nTherefore, red balls = 1 part = 12, blue balls = 2 parts = 24.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Seems consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using percentages or something, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the probability of picking a blue ball would be 2/3, since it's 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. Then, number of blue balls = (2/3) * 36 = 24.\n\nThat's another way to get to the same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I keep arriving at 24 blue balls.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive. The answer should be 24 blue balls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
