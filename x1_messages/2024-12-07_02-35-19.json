        "content": "Let's see. The car travels a total of 120 kilometers in 2 hours. For the first hour, it's going at a constant speed of 40 kilometers per hour. I need to find out what its speed was during the second hour.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how far the car traveled in the first hour. Since it was going at 40 km/h for one hour, it must have covered 40 kilometers in that time. Right?\n\nSo, total distance is 120 km, and in the first hour, it did 40 km. That means, in the second hour, it must have traveled the remaining distance. Let's subtract the first hour's distance from the total distance: 120 km - 40 km = 80 km.\n\nSo, in the second hour, the car traveled 80 kilometers.\n\nNow, speed is distance divided by time. In this case, the time is one hour, since we're looking at the second hour specifically. So, speed during the second hour is 80 km divided by 1 hour, which is 80 km/h.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average speed for the whole trip. The average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 120 km / 2 hours = 60 km/h.\n\nBut that's the average speed. The problem is asking for the speed during the second hour, given that the first hour was at 40 km/h.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the concept of average speed. If the average speed is 60 km/h over two hours, and the first hour was at 40 km/h, then the second hour must have been at a speed that, when averaged with 40 km/h, gives 60 km/h.\n\nLet me set up an equation for that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the speed during the second hour as v.\n\nThen, the average speed is (40 km/h + v) / 2 = 60 km/h.\n\nNow, solve for v:\n\n(40 + v)/2 = 60\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n40 + v = 120\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides:\n\nv = 80 km/h.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of distance equals speed multiplied by time.\n\nFor the first hour: distance1 = 40 km/h * 1 h = 40 km.\n\nFor the second hour: distance2 = v * 1 h = v km.\n\nTotal distance: distance1 + distance2 = 40 km + v km = 120 km.\n\nSo, 40 + v = 120\n\nTherefore, v = 80 km.\n\nAgain, that confirms the speed during the second hour is 80 km/h.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different way to think about it. Suppose the car traveled a different distance in the second hour, but I don't think so. The problem is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that speed is distance over time, and we know the distance for each hour.\n\nBut no, that's the same as what I did earlier.\n\nI think 80 km/h is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the speed during the second hour. For example, if the car was accelerating or something, but the problem says it traveled at a constant speed of 40 km/h in the first hour, and doesn't mention any acceleration, so I think it's safe to assume that in the second hour, it traveled at a constant speed of 80 km/h.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the car was slowing down or speeding up at some point in the second hour, but again, the problem doesn't specify any changes in speed beyond the first hour, so I think assuming a constant speed of 80 km/h in the second hour is reasonable.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total distance and the time taken. The car traveled 120 km in 2 hours, with the first hour at 40 km/h. So, the remaining 80 km must be covered in the second hour, which means 80 km/h.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nSo, the speed during the second hour is 80 kilometers per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
