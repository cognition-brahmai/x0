        "content": "So there are 500 students in total at this school, and 60% of them are boys. I need to find out how many girls there are. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, if 60% of the students are boys, that means the remaining percentage must be girls, right? So, I can calculate the percentage of girls by subtracting the percentage of boys from 100%. That is:\n\n100% - 60% = 40%\n\nSo, 40% of the students are girls.\n\nNow, to find out how many girls there are, I need to calculate 40% of the total number of students, which is 500.\n\nTo calculate 40% of 500, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply by the total number. 40% as a decimal is 0.40.\n\nSo, number of girls = 0.40 * 500\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.40 * 500 = 200\n\nTherefore, there are 200 girls in the school.\n\nWait a minute, just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's see.\n\nAnother way could be to first find out how many boys there are and then subtract that number from the total number of students to get the number of girls.\n\nSo, if 60% are boys, then number of boys = 60% of 500.\n\n60% as a decimal is 0.60.\n\nSo, number of boys = 0.60 * 500 = 300\n\nThen, number of girls = total students - number of boys = 500 - 300 = 200\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, regardless of the method, I end up with 200 girls in the school.\n\nI think that makes sense. Percentages can sometimes be a bit tricky, but breaking it down like this helps confirm the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
