        "content": "Flamingos stand on one leg to conserve body heat and reduce muscle fatigue. By tucking one leg into their feathers, they can keep it warm and minimize heat loss. Additionally, standing on one leg helps them conserve energy by reducing the amount of muscle activity needed to maintain balance. This behavior is common in many bird species and is an adaptation to their living environments."
