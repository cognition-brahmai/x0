        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a city, half of the population own a cat, a third own a dog, and a fourth own a rabbit. I need to find the minimum possible population of the city. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We have fractions of the population owning different pets: cats, dogs, and rabbits. The fractions are 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 respectively. The question is asking for the smallest possible total population that allows these fractions to be whole numbers because you can't have a fraction of a person.\n\nSo, basically, the population must be divisible by 2, 3, and 4 to ensure that when we take half, a third, and a quarter, we get whole numbers.\n\nThis sounds like a problem involving least common multiples, or LCMs. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set.\n\nLet me list out the denominators of the fractions: 2, 3, and 4.\n\nI need to find the LCM of these numbers.\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 2 and 3.\n\n2 and 3 are both prime numbers, so their LCM is simply their product: 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nNow, take that result and find the LCM with 4.\n\n4 can be factored into 2 * 2.\n\nSo, the LCM of 6 and 4 would include the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number.\n\n6 is 2 * 3.\n\n4 is 2^2.\n\nSo, the LCM would be 2^2 * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12.\n\nThis suggests that the smallest population that satisfies the conditions is 12.\n\nLet me check if this works.\n\nIf the population is 12:\n\n- Half own a cat: 12 * 1/2 = 6 people own a cat.\n\n- A third own a dog: 12 * 1/3 = 4 people own a dog.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 12 * 1/4 = 3 people own a rabbit.\n\nAll of these are whole numbers, so it seems to work.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"own a cat,\" \"own a dog,\" and \"own a rabbit.\" It doesn't specify whether someone can own more than one pet or not.\n\nIf people can own multiple pets, then the total number of pet owners could overlap, meaning some people own both a cat and a dog, for example.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the minimum possible population, so perhaps assuming overlapping ownership could allow for a smaller population.\n\nLet me explore that possibility.\n\nSuppose some people own more than one pet. For example, someone could own a cat and a dog, or a cat and a rabbit, etc.\n\nIf we allow for overlaps, maybe we can have a smaller population that satisfies the fractions.\n\nLet me try with a population smaller than 12, say 11.\n\nCheck if 11 works:\n\n- Half own a cat: 11 * 1/2 = 5.5, which is not a whole number. So, 11 doesn't work.\n\nHow about 10?\n\n- Half own a cat: 10 * 1/2 = 5.\n\n- A third own a dog: 10 * 1/3 \u2248 3.333, which is not a whole number. So, 10 doesn't work.\n\nHow about 9?\n\n- Half own a cat: 9 * 1/2 = 4.5, not a whole number.\n\n- A third own a dog: 9 * 1/3 = 3.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 9 * 1/4 = 2.25, not a whole number.\n\nSo, 9 doesn't work.\n\nHow about 8?\n\n- Half own a cat: 8 * 1/2 = 4.\n\n- A third own a dog: 8 * 1/3 \u2248 2.666, not a whole number.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 8 * 1/4 = 2.\n\nSo, 8 doesn't work because of the dog owners.\n\nHow about 7?\n\n- Half own a cat: 7 * 1/2 = 3.5, not a whole number.\n\n- A third own a dog: 7 * 1/3 \u2248 2.333, not a whole number.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 7 * 1/4 = 1.75, not a whole number.\n\n7 doesn't work.\n\nHow about 6?\n\n- Half own a cat: 6 * 1/2 = 3.\n\n- A third own a dog: 6 * 1/3 = 2.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 6 * 1/4 = 1.5, not a whole number.\n\nSo, 6 doesn't work because of the rabbit owners.\n\nHow about 5?\n\n- Half own a cat: 5 * 1/2 = 2.5, not a whole number.\n\n- A third own a dog: 5 * 1/3 \u2248 1.666, not a whole number.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 5 * 1/4 = 1.25, not a whole number.\n\n5 doesn't work.\n\nHow about 4?\n\n- Half own a cat: 4 * 1/2 = 2.\n\n- A third own a dog: 4 * 1/3 \u2248 1.333, not a whole number.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 4 * 1/4 = 1.\n\nSo, 4 doesn't work because of the dog owners.\n\nHow about 3?\n\n- Half own a cat: 3 * 1/2 = 1.5, not a whole number.\n\n- A third own a dog: 3 * 1/3 = 1.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 3 * 1/4 = 0.75, not a whole number.\n\n3 doesn't work.\n\nHow about 2?\n\n- Half own a cat: 2 * 1/2 = 1.\n\n- A third own a dog: 2 * 1/3 \u2248 0.666, not a whole number.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 2 * 1/4 = 0.5, not a whole number.\n\n2 doesn't work.\n\nFinally, 1:\n\n- Half own a cat: 1 * 1/2 = 0.5, not a whole number.\n\n- A third own a dog: 1 * 1/3 \u2248 0.333, not a whole number.\n\n- A fourth own a rabbit: 1 * 1/4 = 0.25, not a whole number.\n\n1 doesn't work.\n\nSo, it seems that 12 is the smallest population where all the fractions come out to whole numbers without considering any overlaps.\n\nBut let's see if overlaps can allow for a smaller population.\n\nSuppose some people own more than one pet. For example, someone could own both a cat and a dog, or a cat and a rabbit, or all three.\n\nIn that case, the total number of pet owners could be less than the sum of the individual pet ownership fractions.\n\nLet's try to find the minimal population by allowing overlaps.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let C be the number of cat owners.\n\n- Let D be the number of dog owners.\n\n- Let R be the number of rabbit owners.\n\n- Let\u2019s denote the population by N.\n\nGiven:\n\nC = N/2\n\nD = N/3\n\nR = N/4\n\nNow, if there are overlaps, the total number of distinct pet owners could be less than C + D + R.\n\nBut the problem is to find the minimal N such that C, D, and R are all integers.\n\nWait, but in the previous approach, N needs to be divisible by 2, 3, and 4, which means N is a multiple of the LCM of 2, 3, and 4, which is 12.\n\nSo, N must be a multiple of 12.\n\nHence, the smallest possible N is 12.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to have overlapping pet ownership to reduce N.\n\nLet me consider N = 12.\n\nAs before:\n\nC = 6\n\nD = 4\n\nR = 3\n\nNow, if we assume no overlaps, the total number of pet owners would be 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, which is more than the population, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there must be overlaps.\n\nThe maximum possible overlaps would minimize the total number of distinct pet owners.\n\nIn the extreme case, all pet owners own all three pets, but that's not possible because C + D + R = 13, which is greater than N = 12.\n\nSo, there must be some overlaps, but not complete overlaps.\n\nLet me use the inclusion-exclusion principle to model this.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets is:\n\n|C \u222a D \u222a R| = C + D + R - (|C \u2229 D| + |C \u2229 R| + |D \u2229 R|) + |C \u2229 D \u2229 R|\n\nIn this case, |C \u222a D \u222a R| \u2264 N.\n\nWe have C + D + R = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13.\n\nWe need to maximize the overlaps to minimize N.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nX = |C \u2229 D| + |C \u2229 R| + |D \u2229 R|\n\nY = |C \u2229 D \u2229 R|\n\nThen,\n\nN \u2265 C + D + R - X + Y\n\nWe need to minimize N, so we need to maximize X - Y.\n\nBut X and Y are constrained by the individual set sizes.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe another approach: think in terms of pet ownership patterns.\n\nEach person can own none, one, two, or all three types of pets.\n\nWe need to assign ownership in such a way that the fractions add up to the given values, with the smallest possible N.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think in terms of the least common multiple again.\n\nSince the fractions are 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4, and their denominators are 2, 3, and 4, the LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12, as previously determined.\n\nTherefore, N must be a multiple of 12.\n\nHence, the smallest possible N is 12.\n\nI don't see a way to make N smaller than 12 while satisfying all the conditions.\n\nEven if we allow overlaps in pet ownership, the fractions require that N is divisible by 2, 3, and 4, which means N must be a multiple of 12.\n\nTherefore, the minimal population is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
