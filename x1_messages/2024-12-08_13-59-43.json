        "content": "Let's see. So, the cyclist is going at a constant speed of 15 miles per hour for 45 minutes. I need to find out how far he travels in that time.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the time from minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 hours. That simplifies to 0.75 hours.\n\nNow, I can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\nDistance = 15 miles per hour \u00d7 0.75 hours\n\nMultiplying those together:\n\nDistance = 11.25 miles\n\nSo, the cyclist travels 11.25 miles in 45 minutes at a constant speed of 15 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using proportions or something like that?\n\nLet's try. If the cyclist rides for one hour, he would cover 15 miles. But he only rides for 45 minutes, which is 3/4 of an hour. So, 3/4 of 15 miles would be:\n\n(3/4) \u00d7 15 = (3 \u00d7 15)/4 = 45/4 = 11.25 miles\n\nSame answer as before. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the speed to miles per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 miles per hour is:\n\n15 miles / 60 minutes = 0.25 miles per minute\n\nThen, for 45 minutes, the distance would be:\n\n0.25 miles per minute \u00d7 45 minutes = 11.25 miles\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems like no matter which method I use, I end up with 11.25 miles.\n\nMaybe I can double-check with another method. Let's use the fact that distance is also equal to speed multiplied by time.\n\nSpeed is 15 miles per hour, time is 45 minutes. Since 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, multiplying them gives:\n\n15 \u00d7 0.75 = 11.25 miles\n\nOnce more, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the cyclist travels 11.25 miles in 45 minutes at a constant speed of 15 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.25} \\]"
