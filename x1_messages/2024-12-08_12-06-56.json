        "content": "To find the radius of a sphere when you know its surface area, you can use the formula for the surface area of a sphere, which is:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the surface area and \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the surface area \\( A \\) is 314 square centimeters, we can plug this value into the formula and solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ 314 = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nFirst, let's divide both sides of the equation by \\( 4\\pi \\) to isolate \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{314}{4\\pi} \\]\n\nWe can calculate the value of \\( \\pi \\) as approximately 3.1416 for more precision. So,\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{314}{4 \\times 3.1416} \\]\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{314}{12.5664} \\]\n\n\\[ r^2 \\approx 25 \\]\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r \\approx \\sqrt{25} \\]\n\n\\[ r \\approx 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the approximate radius of the sphere is 5 centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
