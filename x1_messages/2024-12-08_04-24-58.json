        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 180 km apart. It starts at 60 km/h and halfway through, which I think is at 90 km, it speeds up to 90 km/h. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if the total distance is 180 km, and I can find the total time, then average speed = total distance / total time.\n\nNow, the train travels the first half at 60 km/h and the second half at 90 km/h. The first half is 90 km at 60 km/h, and the second half is also 90 km at 90 km/h.\n\nI need to find the time taken for each half and then add them up to get the total time.\n\nFirst half:\n\nDistance = 90 km\n\nSpeed = 60 km/h\n\nTime = distance / speed = 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours\n\nSecond half:\n\nDistance = 90 km\n\nSpeed = 90 km/h\n\nTime = distance / speed = 90 / 90 = 1 hour\n\nTotal time = 1.5 hours + 1 hour = 2.5 hours\n\nTotal distance = 180 km\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time = 180 / 2.5 = 72 km/h\n\nWait, but I remember that when you have two equal distances traveled at different speeds, the average speed is not just the arithmetic mean. There's a formula for that. Let me check.\n\nThe formula for average speed when two equal distances are traveled at different speeds is:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2)\n\nIn this case, speed1 = 60 km/h and speed2 = 90 km/h\n\nSo, average speed = (2 * 60 * 90) / (60 + 90) = (2 * 5400) / 150 = 10800 / 150 = 72 km/h\n\nOkay, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut wait, I think there's another way to look at it. Maybe using harmonic mean or something. Let me see.\n\nThe harmonic mean of two speeds for the same distance is the correct way to find the average speed. And that's what I just did.\n\nSo, yes, the average speed is 72 km/h.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nTotal distance: 180 km\n\nTime for first half: 90 km / 60 km/h = 1.5 hours\n\nTime for second half: 90 km / 90 km/h = 1 hour\n\nTotal time: 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 hours\n\nAverage speed: 180 km / 2.5 hours = 72 km/h\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, since the distances are equal, I could use the formula I mentioned earlier.\n\nBut I think the way I did it is fine.\n\nSo, the answer should be 72 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
