The word \"crap\" did not originate from the surname of Thomas Crapper, who was indeed a British plumber in the late 19th century. Crapper is often mistakenly credited with inventing the modern toilet, but in reality, he popularized it and made improvements to existing designs.\n\nThe term \"crap\" actually has a much older origin. It comes from the Old French word \"crappe,\" which referred to chaff or waste material from grain. Over time, the word evolved to mean any kind of waste or rubbish. It wasn't until the 19th century that it began to be used as a slang term for excrement.\n\nSo, while Thomas Crapper played a role in popularizing the toilet, his surname is not the source of the word \"crap.\" The connection between the two is purely coincidental."
