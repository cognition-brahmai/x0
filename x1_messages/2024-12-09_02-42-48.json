        "content": "Yes, it is believed that the Aztec people initially thought that Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his men were gods when they first arrived in Mexico in 1519. This belief was based on several factors.\n\nFirstly, the Aztecs had a prophecy about the return of their god Quetzalcoatl, who was said to be a white-skinned, bearded god who would come from the east to reclaim his throne. Cort\u00e9s and his men matched this description, as they were white, bearded, and arrived from the east by sea.\n\nSecondly, the advanced technology and weaponry of the Spaniards were beyond anything the Aztecs had ever seen. The guns, horses, and steel weapons must have seemed like magical or divine instruments to them.\n\nLastly, the timing of the Spaniards' arrival coincided with significant celestial events and omens that the Aztecs interpreted as signs of impending change and possible doom.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this belief was not universal among all Aztecs, and it didn't last long. As the Spaniards' true intentions became clear through their acts of violence and conquest, the Aztecs soon realized that these were not gods but conquerors.\n\n## Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, the Aztecs initially believed that Cort\u00e9s and his men were gods due to their appearance, technology, and the timing of their arrival, which coincided with Aztec prophecies. However, this belief did not last long as the Spaniards' violent intentions became apparent.}} \\]"
