        "content": "Certainly! To merge two sorted lists into a new sorted list in Python, you can use a straightforward approach by combining the lists and then sorting the result. However, since the input lists are already sorted, a more efficient method is to use a two-pointer technique, which avoids the need for sorting the combined list.\n\nHere's how you can implement both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Combining and Sorting\n\nThis method is simple but less efficient for large lists because sorting has a time complexity of O(n log n).\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1, lst2):\n    return sorted(lst1 + lst2)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Two-Pointer Technique\n\nThis method is more efficient, especially for large lists, as it merges the lists in linear time, O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1, lst2):\n    merged_list = []\n    i = j = 0\n\n    # Loop through both lists and append the smaller element\n    while i < len(lst1) and j < len(lst2):\n        if lst1[i] < lst2[j]:\n            merged_list.append(lst1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged_list.append(lst2[j])\n            j += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in lst1, append them\n    while i < len(lst1):\n        merged_list.append(lst1[i])\n        i += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in lst2, append them\n    while j < len(lst2):\n        merged_list.append(lst2[j])\n        j += 1\n\n    return merged_list\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Method 1:** We concatenate the two lists using the `+` operator and then sort the resulting list using the `sorted()` function.\n\n- **Method 2:** We maintain two pointers, `i` and `j`, initialized to 0, to track the current positions in `lst1` and `lst2`, respectively. We compare the elements at these pointers and append the smaller one to the `merged_list`. We then move the pointer of the list from which the element was appended. This process continues until we exhaust one of the lists. Finally, any remaining elements in the non-exhausted list are appended to `merged_list`.\n\nThe second method is generally preferred for its efficiency, especially when dealing with large sorted lists."
