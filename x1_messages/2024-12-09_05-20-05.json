        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"If five machines can make five widgets in five minutes, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?\" Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a scenario with machines making widgets in a certain amount of time, and we need to scale up both the number of machines and the number of widgets, and find out how the time changes.\n\nOkay, so starting with the initial condition: five machines make five widgets in five minutes. That seems straightforward. Now, if I have 100 machines, which is 20 times more machines (because 100 divided by 5 is 20), and I need to make 100 widgets, which is also 20 times more widgets, I might be tempted to think that the time stays the same. But I need to make sure that's the case.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If five machines can make five widgets in five minutes, that means each machine is making one widget in five minutes. So, each machine is responsible for one widget in that time frame.\n\nNow, if I have 100 machines, and each machine can make one widget in five minutes, then in five minutes, 100 machines would make 100 widgets. That seems logical.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor to consider here? Is there any dependency between machines or any constraints that might affect this linear scaling?\n\nLet me consider if there are any setup times or if the machines need to work together in some way. But the problem doesn't mention any such things. It seems like each machine operates independently, making its own widget without interfering with others.\n\nSo, if each machine makes one widget in five minutes, then regardless of how many machines you have, each one is independently producing one widget in that time. Therefore, 100 machines would make 100 widgets in five minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning. Suppose I have one machine: it makes one widget in five minutes. Two machines would make two widgets in five minutes. Ten machines would make ten widgets in five minutes. So, by extension, 100 machines would make 100 widgets in five minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to look at it. Maybe in terms of machine-minutes or something like that.\n\nLet's try that approach. If five machines make five widgets in five minutes, that's a total of 25 machine-minutes (5 machines * 5 minutes), resulting in five widgets. So, the machine-minutes per widget is 25 divided by 5, which is 5 machine-minutes per widget.\n\nNow, if I need 100 widgets, and each widget requires 5 machine-minutes, then the total machine-minutes needed would be 100 widgets * 5 machine-minutes per widget, which is 500 machine-minutes.\n\nIf I have 100 machines working together, the time required would be the total machine-minutes divided by the number of machines, which is 500 machine-minutes divided by 100 machines, which equals 5 minutes.\n\nSo, both approaches lead me to the same conclusion: it would take five minutes for 100 machines to make 100 widgets.\n\nIs there any chance that the time could be less than five minutes? For example, if more machines allow for some sort of parallel processing or efficiency gains. But in this case, since each machine is independent and each is making its own widget without any interaction, I don't think time can be reduced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a fixed setup time that doesn't scale with the number of machines or widgets, but the problem doesn't mention any setup time, so I'll assume that it's not a factor here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the rate at which machines produce widgets. If five machines make five widgets in five minutes, then the rate is five widgets per five minutes, which is one widget per machine per five minutes.\n\nSo, the rate per machine is one widget every five minutes. Therefore, regardless of how many machines you have, each machine will still produce one widget every five minutes.\n\n Hence, 100 machines will produce 100 widgets in five minutes.\n\nI think this is pretty much it. The answer should be five minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
