        "content": "Sure! Below is an implementation of a C++ class representing a 2D point with x and y coordinates. The class includes methods for calculating the distance between two points, checking if two points are equal, and finding the midpoint between two points. Additionally, the + and - operators are overloaded to add and subtract points.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nclass Point2D {\nprivate:\n    double x;\n    double y;\n\npublic:\n    // Constructor\n    Point2D(double x = 0.0, double y = 0.0) : x(x), y(y) {}\n\n    // Getters\n    double getX() const { return x; }\n    double getY() const { return y; }\n\n    // Setters\n    void setX(double x) { this->x = x; }\n    void setY(double y) { this->y = y; }\n\n    // Method to calculate the distance between two points\n    double distance(const Point2D& other) const {\n        double dx = x - other.x;\n        double dy = y - other.y;\n        return std::sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n    }\n\n    // Method to check if two points are equal\n    bool isEqual(const Point2D& other) const {\n        return (x == other.x && y == other.y);\n    }\n\n    // Method to find the midpoint between two points\n    Point2D midpoint(const Point2D& other) const {\n        double mx = (x + other.x) / 2.0;\n        double my = (y + other.y) / 2.0;\n        return Point2D(mx, my);\n    }\n\n    // Overloaded + operator to add two points\n    Point2D operator+(const Point2D& other) const {\n        return Point2D(x + other.x, y + other.y);\n    }\n\n    // Overloaded - operator to subtract two points\n    Point2D operator-(const Point2D& other) const {\n        return Point2D(x - other.x, y - other.y);\n    }\n\n    // Friend function to output the point\n    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Point2D& point);\n};\n\n// Overloaded << operator to print the point\nstd::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Point2D& point) {\n    os << \"(\" << point.x << \", \" << point.y << \")\";\n    return os;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    Point2D p1(3.0, 4.0);\n    Point2D p2(6.0, 8.0);\n\n    std::cout << \"Point 1: \" << p1 << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Point 2: \" << p2 << std::endl;\n\n    double dist = p1.distance(p2);\n    std::cout << \"Distance between p1 and p2: \" << dist << std::endl;\n\n    bool areEqual = p1.isEqual(p2);\n    std::cout << \"Are p1 and p2 equal? \" << (areEqual ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\n\n    Point2D mid = p1.midpoint(p2);\n    std::cout << \"Midpoint between p1 and p2: \" << mid << std::endl;\n\n    Point2D sum = p1 + p2;\n    std::cout << \"Sum of p1 and p2: \" << sum << std::endl;\n\n    Point2D diff = p1 - p2;\n    std::cout << \"Difference of p1 and p2: \" << diff << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class Definition**:\n   - `Point2D` class has private members `x` and `y` to store the coordinates.\n   - A constructor to initialize the coordinates.\n   - Getter and setter methods for `x` and `y`.\n\n2. **Methods**:\n   - `distance(const Point2D& other) const`: Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.\n   - `isEqual(const Point2D& other) const`: Checks if two points are equal by comparing their coordinates.\n   - `midpoint(const Point2D& other) const`: Computes the midpoint between two points.\n\n3. **Operator Overloading**:\n   - `operator+`: Overloads the + operator to add two points, returning a new point with coordinates that are the sum of the corresponding coordinates of the operands.\n   - `operator-`: Overloads the - operator to subtract one point from another, returning a new point with coordinates that are the difference of the corresponding coordinates of the operands.\n\n4. **Output Operator**:\n   - `operator<<`: Overloads the << operator to allow easy printing of `Point2D` objects using `std::cout`.\n\nThis implementation provides a comprehensive way to handle 2D points in C++, including essential operations and custom operator overloading for enhanced functionality."
