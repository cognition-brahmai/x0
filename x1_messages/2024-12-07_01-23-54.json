        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory produces 150 units every day, and each unit costs $12 to make but is sold for $20. We need to find out the profit after 10 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit is. Profit is basically the amount of money earned after subtracting the costs from the revenue. So, profit equals revenue minus cost.\n\nNow, let's find out the daily revenue and daily cost, and then we can calculate the daily profit. After that, we can multiply the daily profit by 10 to get the profit over 10 days.\n\nAlright, starting with the daily production: 150 units per day.\n\nEach unit is sold for $20, so the daily revenue should be the number of units multiplied by the selling price per unit.\n\nSo, daily revenue = 150 units * $20/unit = $3000.\n\nNext, each unit costs $12 to produce, so the daily cost is the number of units multiplied by the production cost per unit.\n\nDaily cost = 150 units * $12/unit = $1800.\n\nNow, daily profit is revenue minus cost, so:\n\nDaily profit = $3000 - $1800 = $1200.\n\nFinally, to find the profit after 10 days, we multiply the daily profit by 10:\n\nTotal profit = $1200/day * 10 days = $12,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nUnits per day: 150\n\nSelling price per unit: $20\n\nProduction cost per unit: $12\n\nSo, profit per unit = selling price - production cost = $20 - $12 = $8.\n\nThen, daily profit should be profit per unit multiplied by the number of units produced daily:\n\nDaily profit = $8 * 150 = $1200.\n\nOver 10 days, total profit = $1200 * 10 = $12,000.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total revenue and total cost over 10 days.\n\nTotal units produced in 10 days: 150 units/day * 10 days = 1500 units.\n\nTotal revenue: 1500 units * $20/unit = $30,000.\n\nTotal cost: 1500 units * $12/unit = $18,000.\n\nTotal profit: $30,000 - $18,000 = $12,000.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the profit per unit:\n\nProfit per unit: $8.\n\nTotal units: 1500.\n\nTotal profit: $8 * 1500 = $12,000.\n\nEverything points to $12,000 being the correct profit after 10 days.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]"
