        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. We have a group of 50 people, out of which 20 are wearing glasses and 30 are not. We need to find the probability that if we randomly select two people from this group, both of them are wearing glasses.\n\nOkay, probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step. First, I need to recall the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to select two people out of 50. And the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to select two people who are both wearing glasses.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is using combinations, because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. The combination formula is:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 50 is \\( C(50, 2) \\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[ C(50, 2) = \\frac{50!}{2!(50 - 2)!} = \\frac{50!}{2! \\times 48!} \\]\n\nNow, \\( 50! \\) is 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48!, so the 48! cancels out:\n\n\\[ C(50, 2) = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{2450}{2} = 1225 \\]\n\nSo, there are 1225 possible pairs of people.\n\nNext, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 people who are wearing glasses out of the 20 who wear glasses. That would be \\( C(20, 2) \\):\n\n\\[ C(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20 - 2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!} \\]\n\nAgain, \\( 20! \\) is 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!, so:\n\n\\[ C(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190 \\]\n\nSo, there are 190 pairs of people who both wear glasses.\n\nNow, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{190}{1225} \\]\n\nLet's simplify this fraction. Both 190 and 1225 can be divided by 5:\n\n\\[ \\frac{190 \\div 5}{1225 \\div 5} = \\frac{38}{245} \\]\n\nCan this be simplified further? Let's check if 38 and 245 have any common factors. 38 is 2 \u00d7 19, and 245 is 5 \u00d7 49, which is 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7. No common factors, so the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this probability as a decimal or a percentage. Let's calculate it as a decimal:\n\n\\[ \\frac{38}{245} \\approx 0.1551 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.1551, or 15.51%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities sequentially?\n\nLet's think about it. The probability that the first person selected wears glasses is 20 out of 50, which is \\( \\frac{20}{50} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nThen, given that the first person wears glasses, the probability that the second person also wears glasses is \\( \\frac{19}{49} \\), because there are now 19 glasses-wearing people left out of 49 total people left.\n\nSo, the combined probability would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{50} \\times \\frac{19}{49} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{19}{49} = \\frac{38}{245} \\]\n\nLook at that, it's the same result as before: \\( \\frac{38}{245} \\), which is approximately 0.1551 or 15.51%.\n\nSo, both methods give us the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the probability that both selected people are wearing glasses is \\( \\frac{38}{245} \\), or about 15.51%.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the order of selection matters. In combinations, order doesn't matter, which is appropriate here because we're just selecting two people without regard to order.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to consider permutations, where order matters, the total number of ways to select two people would be \\( P(50, 2) = 50 \\times 49 = 2450 \\), and the number of favorable outcomes would be \\( P(20, 2) = 20 \\times 19 = 380 \\). Then, the probability would be \\( \\frac{380}{2450} = \\frac{38}{245} \\), which is the same as before.\n\nSo, whether we use combinations or permutations, we end up with the same probability.\n\nI think that's solid. Unless there's some other factor I'm missing, but based on the information given, this seems correct.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, \\( C(50, 2) = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = 1225 \\). That seems right.\n\nThen, \\( C(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190 \\). Correct.\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{190}{1225} = \\frac{38}{245} \\). That's right, dividing numerator and denominator by 5.\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{38}{245} \\) is approximately 0.1551, which is 15.51%.\n\nAlternatively, using the sequential probability: \\( \\frac{20}{50} \\times \\frac{19}{49} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{19}{49} = \\frac{38}{245} \\). Same result.\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{38}{245}} \\]"
