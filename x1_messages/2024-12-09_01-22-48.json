        "content": "Let's see. The factory starts by producing 200 units in 5 days, and each day they increase production by 10 units. I need to find out how many units they will produce on the 9th day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much they produce each day. Since they increase production by 10 units each day, this sounds like an arithmetic sequence where the production increases by a common difference each day.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\( a_1 \\) as the production on the first day\n\n- \\( d \\) as the common difference, which is 10 units\n\n- \\( n \\) as the day number\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\]\n\nBut wait, I need to find the production on the 9th day, which would be \\( a_9 \\).\n\nHowever, I don't know the production on the first day. I only know that in 5 days, they produce 200 units.\n\nSo, maybe I should find the total production over 5 days and set it equal to 200 units.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\n\\[ s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d) \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nI have \\( s_5 = 200 \\), \\( n = 5 \\), \\( d = 10 \\), and I need to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\nLet me use the first sum formula:\n\n\\[ 200 = \\frac{5}{2} \\times (2a_1 + (5 - 1) \\times 10) \\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 200 = \\frac{5}{2} \\times (2a_1 + 40) \\]\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[ 400 = 5 \\times (2a_1 + 40) \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ 80 = 2a_1 + 40 \\]\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 40 = 2a_1 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ a_1 = 20 \\]\n\nSo, the production on the first day is 20 units.\n\nNow, to find the production on the 9th day, use the nth term formula:\n\n\\[ a_9 = a_1 + (9 - 1)d \\]\n\n\\[ a_9 = 20 + 8 \\times 10 \\]\n\n\\[ a_9 = 20 + 80 \\]\n\n\\[ a_9 = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, on the 9th day, the factory will produce 100 units.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with \\( a_1 = 20 \\), and \\( d = 10 \\), the production each day would be:\n\n- Day 1: 20 units\n\n- Day 2: 30 units\n\n- Day 3: 40 units\n\n- Day 4: 50 units\n\n- Day 5: 60 units\n\nTotal production in 5 days: 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 = 200 units, which matches the given information.\n\nSo, on the 9th day:\n\n- Day 6: 70 units\n\n- Day 7: 80 units\n\n- Day 8: 90 units\n\n- Day 9: 100 units\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
