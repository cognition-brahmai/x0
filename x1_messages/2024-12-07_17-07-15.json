Each plan should correspond to an evidence value derived from the output of a specific function based on either the user query, prior evidence values, or both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nBingSearch[input]: Allows users to conduct online searches via Bing. Useful for obtaining a list of potentially helpful sites related to the user's inquiry.\nURLParser[input]: Retrieves plaintext content from URLs provided in a newline-separated input string.\nHyperlinkDetector[input]: Identifies hyperlinks within plaintext and returns them in a newline-separated format.\nNLM[input]: Natural Language Model capable of answering queries based on supplied textual evidence. Queries should reference an :evidence[n]: variable (e.g., \"What's the weather like, given :evidence1:?\").\n\nOutput Format:\nPlan: [Initial action based on input query]\n:evidence0: = [Function to execute with input parameters]\nPlan: [Subsequent action based on :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to execute with input parameters, possibly referencing earlier evidence (e.g., \"Context: :evidence0\")]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: contains the ultimate solution]\n\nQuestion: Which company developed the first smartphone and when was it released?"
