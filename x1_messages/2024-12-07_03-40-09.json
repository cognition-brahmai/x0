        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: a rectangular room has a length of 20 feet and a width of 14 feet. I need to find out the area of the room in square feet. Alright, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. That makes sense because a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal, and area is basically the space inside the shape.\n\nSo, in this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 14 feet. That means I just need to multiply 20 by 14 to get the area in square feet.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 20 multiplied by 14.\n\nWell, 20 times 10 is 200, and 20 times 4 is 80. So, 200 plus 80 equals 280.\n\nTherefore, the area of the room is 280 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to verify this? Maybe I can use the formula for the area again to double-check.\n\nLength times width: 20 times 14 is indeed 280.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about breaking down the rectangle into smaller parts. For example, imagine the room is divided into two parts: one that's 20 feet by 10 feet and another that's 20 feet by 4 feet.\n\nThe area of the first part would be 20 times 10, which is 200 square feet.\n\nThe area of the second part would be 20 times 4, which is 80 square feet.\n\nAdding those together, 200 plus 80, still gives me 280 square feet.\n\nAlright, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the area is 280 square feet.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using the diagonal or something, but no, that's not necessary for finding the area. The area is straightforward: length times width.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Both the length and width are given in feet, so multiplying them gives square feet, which is the correct unit for area.\n\nIf the dimensions were in different units, I'd need to convert them first, but in this case, they're both in feet, so I'm good.\n\nAlso, I should note that this is a rectangular room, so the formula for the area of a rectangle applies here. If it were a different shape, like a circle or a triangle, the formula would be different.\n\nBut since it's a rectangle, area equals length times width is the way to go.\n\nSo, final answer: 280 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]"
