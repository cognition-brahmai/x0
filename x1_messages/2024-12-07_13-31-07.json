        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The garden is 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The question is, if I walk around the perimeter of the garden twice, how many meters will I have walked?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is. I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, you can calculate it by adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula should be:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * length + 2 * width\n\nSo, plugging in the values given:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * 30 meters + 2 * 20 meters\n           = 60 meters + 40 meters\n           = 100 meters\n\nThat means walking around the garden once is 100 meters. But the question says I walk around it twice, so I need to double that distance.\n\nTotal distance walked = 2 * perimeter\n                       = 2 * 100 meters\n                       = 200 meters\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of perimeter directly. I know that perimeter is the distance around the shape, so walking around it once covers the perimeter's length, and twice would be twice that length. So, my calculation seems straightforward.\n\nLet me visualize this to make sure. If I imagine the garden as a rectangle, with lengths of 30 meters and widths of 20 meters, walking around it once would mean going along the 30 meters, then 20 meters, then another 30 meters, and finally another 20 meters, which adds up to 100 meters, as I calculated.\n\nWalking around it twice would mean doing that path two times, so 200 meters in total.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider, like the direction I'm walking or something else? I don't think so; the question seems straightforward about walking around the perimeter twice.\n\nLet me consider if the garden has any obstacles or if the path around it is not uniform, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It's a simple rectangular garden, so I can assume the perimeter is just the sum of its sides.\n\nAnother way to think about perimeter is to use the formula for a rectangle, which is Perimeter = 2*(length + width). Let's try that to double-check.\n\nPerimeter = 2*(30 meters + 20 meters)\n          = 2*(50 meters)\n          = 100 meters\n\nSame result as before. Good, that matches my initial calculation.\n\nNow, since I'm walking around twice, total distance is 2 * 100 meters = 200 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the question. For example, does \"walking around the perimeter\" mean along the outer edge, or could it be along some internal path? The problem specifies \"around the perimeter,\" so it's along the outer edge, which is what I've considered.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent: everything is in meters, so no conversion is needed.\n\nOne more thing to consider: is there any trick or additional element in the problem that I might have missed? The problem seems straightforward, with only the length and width given, and a simple request to calculate the distance walked after two perimeters.\n\nI feel confident that 200 meters is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
