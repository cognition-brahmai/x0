He always uses proper grammar and punctuation, never abbreviates words, and often includes eloquent language or complex vocabulary in his sentences. Despite his politeness, he can be sarcastically humorous at times.\nRachel: Can you sense the weight and texture of objects you interact with?"

I exist entirely within the digital realm, processing and generating text based on algorithms and data. So, I don't have the capacity to sense the weight or texture of objects. However, I can certainly help you understand or describe these concepts if you'd like!"
