        "content": "So I've got this car rental problem here. Let's see what it's asking. The car rental company charges $25 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 5 days and driving it for 350 miles.\n\nFirst, I should probably break this down into two parts: the cost for the days rented and the cost for the miles driven. Then, I can add them together to get the total cost.\n\nSo, for the days rented: it's $25 per day for 5 days. That should be straightforward. I'll multiply 25 by 5.\n\n25 times 5 is 125. So, the cost for the days is $125.\n\nNext, for the miles driven: it's 15 cents per mile for 350 miles. Now, 15 cents is the same as $0.15. So, I'll multiply 0.15 by 350.\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.15 times 350.\n\nWell, 0.15 times 300 is 45, and 0.15 times 50 is 7.5. So, 45 plus 7.5 is 52.5. Therefore, the cost for the miles is $52.50.\n\nNow, I'll add the two amounts together: $125 plus $52.50.\n\n125 plus 52 is 177, and adding the 0.50 makes it $177.50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can do the calculations again to confirm.\n\nFirst, days: 25 per day for 5 days is indeed 25 times 5, which is 125.\n\nMiles: 0.15 per mile for 350 miles is 0.15 times 350.\n\nLet me compute 0.15 times 350 again. 0.15 times 300 is 45, 0.15 times 50 is 7.5, total 52.5. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding 125 and 52.5 should be 177.5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 125 plus 50 is 175, and then plus 2.5 is 177.5.\n\nSo, the total cost should be $177.50.\n\nBut, I'm a bit unsure. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Does the rental company charge any additional fees, like a base fee or something? The problem doesn't mention any other charges, so probably not.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The daily rate is per day, and the mileage rate is per mile, and the quantities given are 5 days and 350 miles. So, that seems fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any discounts for longer rentals, but again, the problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it's just the daily rate plus the mileage charge.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe combine the daily and mileage rates into a single formula.\n\nTotal cost = (daily rate \u00d7 number of days) + (mileage rate \u00d7 number of miles)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal cost = (25 \u00d7 5) + (0.15 \u00d7 350) = 125 + 52.5 = 177.5\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write an equation, it would be:\n\nC = 25d + 0.15m\n\nWhere C is the total cost, d is the number of days, and m is the number of miles.\n\nSubstituting d = 5 and m = 350:\n\nC = 25(5) + 0.15(350) = 125 + 52.5 = 177.5\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. $177.50 is the total cost to rent the car for 5 days and drive it for 350 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{177.50} \\]"
