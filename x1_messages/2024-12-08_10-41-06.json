        "content": "So, we have three friends who want to share 8 pizzas equally. The question is, how much pizza does each friend get? Hmm, this seems like a division problem, right? I need to divide the total number of pizzas by the number of friends to find out how much each one gets.\n\nFirst, let's identify the total number of pizzas and the number of friends. There are 8 pizzas and 3 friends. So, I need to divide 8 by 3. But, 8 divided by 3 doesn't give a whole number. Let me do the division: 8 \u00f7 3 equals 2 with a remainder of 2, because 3 times 2 is 6, and 8 minus 6 is 2.\n\nSo, each friend gets 2 whole pizzas, and there are 2 pizzas left to share among the three friends. To find out how much of a pizza each friend gets from these remaining 2 pizzas, I need to divide these 2 pizzas by 3.\n\nDividing 2 by 3 gives us 2/3. So, each friend gets an additional 2/3 of a pizza.\n\nTherefore, each friend gets 2 and 2/3 pizzas in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If each friend gets 2 and 2/3 pizzas, and there are 3 friends, then the total amount of pizza distributed would be 2 and 2/3 multiplied by 3.\n\nFirst, convert 2 and 2/3 to an improper fraction: 2 and 2/3 is the same as (2 * 3 + 2)/3 = (6 + 2)/3 = 8/3.\n\nNow, multiply 8/3 by 3: (8/3) * 3 = 8.\n\nYes, that matches the total number of pizzas we started with, which is 8. So, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of pizza slices if each pizza is divided into, say, 3 slices. Then, 8 pizzas would have 8 * 3 = 24 slices. Sharing 24 slices among 3 friends would give each friend 8 slices. Since each slice is 1/3 of a pizza, 8 slices would be 8 * (1/3) = 8/3, which is the same as 2 and 2/3 pizzas.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of fractions from the beginning, each friend gets 1/3 of the total pizzas. So, 1/3 of 8 pizzas is 8/3, which is 2 and 2/3 pizzas.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. Each friend gets 2 and 2/3 pizzas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\frac{2}{3}} \\]"
