        "content": "Let's see. There's a box with red and blue balls, and there are twice as many red balls as blue balls. The total number of balls is 18. I need to find out how many blue balls there are.\n\nOkay, so let's denote the number of blue balls as B. Since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, the number of red balls would be 2B.\n\nThe total number of balls is the sum of blue and red balls, so:\n\nB + 2B = 18\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3B = 18\n\nNow, to find B, I just need to divide both sides by 3:\n\nB = 18 / 3\n\nB = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 blue balls in the box.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If there are 6 blue balls, then there should be twice as many red balls, which would be 12 red balls. Adding those together: 6 + 12 = 18, which matches the total number of balls.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
