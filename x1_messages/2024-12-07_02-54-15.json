        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters. I need to find two things: the area in square meters and the perimeter in meters.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the area. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. Given that the length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters, I can plug those values into the formula.\n\nArea = 15 meters * 8 meters = 120 square meters.\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. Now, for the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is the total distance around the edge. I think the formula for perimeter is twice the sum of the length and the width. So, perimeter equals two times length plus width.\n\nLet me write that down: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).\n\nPlugging in the values: Perimeter = 2 * (15 meters + 8 meters) = 2 * 23 meters = 46 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. The perimeter should be the sum of all four sides. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so it would be length plus width plus length plus width, which is the same as two times length plus two times width, which simplifies to two times the sum of length and width.\n\nSo, Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 8) = 2 * 23 = 46 meters. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can visualize this. Imagine walking around the garden. You start at one corner, walk 15 meters along the length, then turn right and walk 8 meters along the width, turn right again and walk back 15 meters along the length, and finally turn right one more time to walk 8 meters back to the starting point. So, total distance walked is 15 + 8 + 15 + 8 = 46 meters. That matches the calculation.\n\nAlso, for the area, it's like covering the entire garden with square meters. Each square meter is a 1 meter by 1 meter tile. So, if the garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, you'd need 15 times 8, which is 120 tiles. So, 120 square meters.\n\nI think that's it. The area is 120 square meters, and the perimeter is 46 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\boxed{120} square meters, and the perimeter is \\boxed{46} meters."
