        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains: one leaving Station A going towards Station B at 60 km/h, and the other leaving Station B going towards Station A at 90 km/h. The distance between the two stations is 180 km. I need to find out how far from Station A they meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how their positions change over time. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the relative speed is 60 km/h plus 90 km/h, which is 150 km/h. That means they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 150 km per hour.\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is 180 km. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nSo, Time = 180 km / 150 km/h = 1.2 hours.\n\nAlright, so they meet after 1.2 hours. Now, to find out how far from Station A they meet, I can calculate the distance the first train covers in that time.\n\nDistance from A = Speed of Train A * Time\n\nDistance from A = 60 km/h * 1.2 hours = 72 km.\n\nSo, they meet 72 km away from Station A.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the ratios of their speeds. Since they start at the same time and meet at some point, the distances they cover should be in the ratio of their speeds.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the distance from Station A to the meeting point as D_A, and the distance from Station B to the meeting point as D_B. We know that D_A + D_B = 180 km.\n\nThe time taken by both trains to meet should be the same. So, Time = D_A / 60 = D_B / 90.\n\nSince D_B = 180 - D_A, we can substitute:\n\nD_A / 60 = (180 - D_A) / 90\n\nNow, solve for D_A.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n90 * D_A = 60 * (180 - D_A)\n\n90 D_A = 10800 - 60 D_A\n\nNow, add 60 D_A to both sides:\n\n150 D_A = 10800\n\nThen, divide both sides by 150:\n\nD_A = 10800 / 150 = 72 km.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the meeting point is indeed 72 km from Station A.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using relative velocity concepts.\n\nIf I consider Train A as stationary, then Train B is approaching it at a relative speed of 60 + 90 = 150 km/h, as I did before. Then, the time to cover the 180 km gap is 1.2 hours, and in that time, Train A would have traveled 60 * 1.2 = 72 km, which again confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider Train B as stationary, then Train A is approaching it at 150 km/h, and the time to meet is still 1.2 hours, but I'm interested in the distance from A, which is again 60 * 1.2 = 72 km.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods. I think 72 km is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider the speeds in terms of km per minute to see if that gives the same result.\n\nTrain A: 60 km/h = 1 km per minute\n\nTrain B: 90 km/h = 1.5 km per minute\n\nTogether, they cover 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 km per minute.\n\nTotal distance is 180 km, so time to meet is 180 / 2.5 = 72 minutes.\n\nIn 72 minutes, Train A covers 1 km/min * 72 min = 72 km.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The trains meet 72 km away from Station A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
