        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces three types of products: A, B, and C, with a production ratio of 5:3:2. The total production per day is 500 items. I need to find out how many of each type they produce daily.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the ratio means. The ratio 5:3:2 tells me that for every 5 units of product A, there are 3 units of product B and 2 units of product C. So, the total parts of the ratio are 5 + 3 + 2, which is 10 parts altogether.\n\nNow, if the total production is 500 items, these 500 items are divided into 10 parts as per the ratio. To find out how many items each part represents, I can divide the total production by the total number of parts.\n\nSo, number of items per part = total production / total parts = 500 / 10 = 50 items per part.\n\nNow, to find the production of each product type:\n\n- Product A: 5 parts \u00d7 50 items per part = 250 items\n\n- Product B: 3 parts \u00d7 50 items per part = 150 items\n\n- Product C: 2 parts \u00d7 50 items per part = 100 items\n\nLet me check if these add up to the total production:\n\n250 + 150 + 100 = 500 items. Yes, that matches the total given.\n\nSo, the factory produces 250 units of product A, 150 units of product B, and 100 units of product C daily.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250 \\text{ units of A}, 150 \\text{ units of B}, 100 \\text{ units of C}} \\]"
