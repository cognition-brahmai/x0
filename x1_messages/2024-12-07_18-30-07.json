        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a train going from City A to City B at 60 mph and coming back at 80 mph. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I should remember what average speed means. It's not just the average of the two speeds, right? Because the time taken for each part of the trip is different due to the different speeds.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance divided by total time. That makes sense.\n\nLet me assume the distance between City A and City B is D miles. So, the total distance for the round trip is 2D miles.\n\nNow, time taken to go from A to B at 60 mph is D divided by 60 hours.\n\nTime taken to return from B to A at 80 mph is D divided by 80 hours.\n\nSo, total time is (D/60 + D/80) hours.\n\nTo add those fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, 60 and 80 both divide into 240.\n\nSo, D/60 is (4D)/240, and D/80 is (3D)/240.\n\nAdded together, that's (4D + 3D)/240 = 7D/240 hours.\n\nSimplify that, 7D/240 = D/240*7 = D/240*7 = hmm, better to keep it as 7D over 240.\n\nNow, average speed is total distance over total time, which is 2D divided by (7D/240).\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\nSo, 2D divided by (7D/240) is 2D * (240)/(7D).\n\nThe D's cancel out, so it's 2 * 240 / 7 = 480 / 7.\n\nNow, 480 divided by 7 is 68.5714... mph.\n\nSo, the average speed is approximately 68.57 mph.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a formula for this.\n\nI recall that for round trips with different speeds, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe formula for the harmonic mean of two speeds is: 2AB/(A + B), where A and B are the speeds.\n\nSo, plugging in A = 60 and B = 80:\n\n(2 * 60 * 80) / (60 + 80) = (9600) / (140) = 68.5714 mph.\n\nSame as what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I remember the formula for average speed for a round trip: (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nAgain, plugging in the values: (2 * 60 * 80) / (60 + 80) = same as above.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is approximately 68.57 mph.\n\nBut maybe I should express it as a fraction for exactness.\n\n480 divided by 7 is exactly 68 and 4/7 mph.\n\nSo, the average speed is 68 and 4/7 mph.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal form, it's approximately 68.5714 mph.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{68.57 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
