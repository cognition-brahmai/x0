        "content": "So I have this problem: \"What is the sum of all the divisors of the number 360?\" Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is any integer that divides that number completely without leaving a remainder. So, for 360, I need to find all the numbers that divide 360 evenly and then add them up.\n\nOne way to do this is to list out all the divisors of 360 and then sum them up. But that seems time-consuming, especially for a number like 360, which might have a lot of divisors. There has to be a more efficient way.\n\nI recall that there's a formula to find the sum of the divisors of a number based on its prime factorization. So, maybe I should start by factoring 360 into its prime components.\n\nLet's factorize 360:\n\n360 divided by 2 is 180.\n\n180 divided by 2 is 90.\n\n90 divided by 2 is 45.\n\n45 divided by 3 is 15.\n\n15 divided by 3 is 5.\n\n5 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 360 is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1.\n\nNow, the formula for the sum of the divisors is (p^(a+1) - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime p raised to the power a, and then multiply these together for all prime factors.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the sum of the divisors function for a prime power p^a is 1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^a, which is equal to (p^(a+1) - 1)/(p - 1). And for multiple primes, since the divisors are multiplicative, we can multiply these sums together.\n\nSo, for 360 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1, the sum of the divisors should be:\n\n(2^(3+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) * (3^(2+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) * (5^(1+1) - 1)/(5 - 1)\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, for 2^3:\n\n(2^4 - 1)/(2 - 1) = (16 - 1)/1 = 15/1 = 15\n\nNext, for 3^2:\n\n(3^3 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13\n\nThen, for 5^1:\n\n(5^2 - 1)/(5 - 1) = (25 - 1)/4 = 24/4 = 6\n\nNow, multiply them together:\n\n15 * 13 * 6\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 15 * 13:\n\n15*10 = 150\n\n15*3 = 45\n\n150 + 45 = 195\n\nNow, 195 * 6:\n\n100*6 = 600\n\n95*6: 90*6 = 540, 5*6=30, so 540 + 30 = 570\n\nBut wait, actually, 195*6:\n\n100*6 = 600\n\n95*6 = 570\n\nTotal: 600 + 570 = 1170\n\nSo, the sum of the divisors of 360 is 1170.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should verify this by listing some of the divisors and adding them up.\n\nLet's list the divisors of 360.\n\nStarting with 1 and 360.\n\nThen, 2 and 180.\n\n3 and 120.\n\n4 and 90.\n\n5 and 72.\n\n6 and 60.\n\n8 and 45.\n\n9 and 40.\n\n10 and 36.\n\n12 and 30.\n\n15 and 24.\n\n18 and 20.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n\n1 + 360 = 361\n\n2 + 180 = 182\n\n3 + 120 = 123\n\n4 + 90 = 94\n\n5 + 72 = 77\n\n6 + 60 = 66\n\n8 + 45 = 53\n\n9 + 40 = 49\n\n10 + 36 = 46\n\n12 + 30 = 42\n\n15 + 24 = 39\n\n18 + 20 = 38\n\nNow, add these sums together:\n\nStart with 361.\n\nAdd 182: 361 + 182 = 543\n\nAdd 123: 543 + 123 = 666\n\nAdd 94: 666 + 94 = 760\n\nAdd 77: 760 + 77 = 837\n\nAdd 66: 837 + 66 = 903\n\nAdd 53: 903 + 53 = 956\n\nAdd 49: 956 + 49 = 1005\n\nAdd 46: 1005 + 46 = 1051\n\nAdd 42: 1051 + 42 = 1093\n\nAdd 39: 1093 + 39 = 1132\n\nAdd 38: 1132 + 38 = 1170\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier calculation of 1170.\n\nSo, the sum of all the divisors of 360 is 1170.\n\nAlternatively, if I had made a mistake in the listing method, the formula method is also confirmed by the listing method.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1170.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1170} \\]"
