        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that if I pick one fruit at random from each of Alice's, Bob's, and Carol's bags, all three fruits are apples. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in each person's bag:\n\n- Alice has 8 apples and 12 oranges.\n\n- Bob has 15 apples and 5 oranges.\n\n- Carol has 7 apples and 13 oranges.\n\nSo, for each person, I need to find the probability of picking an apple from their respective bags, and then, since these are independent events, multiply those probabilities together to get the overall probability that all three fruits are apples.\n\nLet me start by finding the probability of picking an apple from each person's bag.\n\nFor Alice:\n\nTotal fruits Alice has: 8 apples + 12 oranges = 20 fruits.\n\nProbability of picking an apple from Alice's bag: 8/20 = 2/5.\n\nFor Bob:\n\nTotal fruits Bob has: 15 apples + 5 oranges = 20 fruits.\n\nProbability of picking an apple from Bob's bag: 15/20 = 3/4.\n\nFor Carol:\n\nTotal fruits Carol has: 7 apples + 13 oranges = 20 fruits.\n\nProbability of picking an apple from Carol's bag: 7/20.\n\nNow, since these are independent events, the probability that all three events happen (i.e., picking an apple from each bag) is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, overall probability = (2/5) * (3/4) * (7/20).\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 2/5 by 3/4:\n\n(2/5) * (3/4) = (2*3)/(5*4) = 6/20 = 3/10.\n\nThen, multiply that result by 7/20:\n\n(3/10) * (7/20) = (3*7)/(10*20) = 21/200.\n\nSo, the probability that all three fruits picked are apples is 21/200.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if this makes sense. Each person has 20 fruits in their bag, and we're picking one fruit from each bag independently. The probabilities seem correct, and multiplying them for independent events is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total possible outcomes. The total number of ways to pick one fruit from each bag is 20 * 20 * 20 = 8000 possible outcomes.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes, where all three fruits are apples, would be the number of ways to pick an apple from each bag, which is 8 * 15 * 7 = 840.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 840 / 8000 = 840 \u00f7 8000 = 0.105, which is the same as 21/200 when simplified.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify it further to a decimal to understand it better. 21 divided by 200 is 0.105, which is 10.5%.\n\nSo, there's a 10.5% chance that all three fruits picked are apples.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Suppose I consider the probability of not picking an apple from any bag and then subtract that from 1, but that seems more complicated for this problem since it's easier to directly calculate the probability of all three being apples.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no dependencies or other factors affecting the probabilities. In this case, since the picks are independent, multiplying the individual probabilities is correct.\n\nWait, one thing to consider is whether the fruits are being replaced after picking, but since we're picking one fruit from each bag separately, and presuming that the bags are large enough that removing one fruit doesn't significantly change the probabilities, we can treat them as independent events.\n\nIf the bags were very small, or if we were picking multiple fruits without replacement, that could affect the probabilities, but in this case, with 20 fruits in each bag, removing one shouldn't change the probabilities significantly.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the probability is indeed 21/200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{21}{200}} \\]"
