        "content": "The primary method used by cultural anthropologists in their studies is participant observation. This involves immersing oneself in the community or culture being studied, actively participating in its activities, and observing the social interactions and cultural practices firsthand. This method allows anthropologists to gain deep insights into the daily lives and cultural norms of the people they are studying. While interviews and surveys are also used, participant observation is considered the cornerstone of ethnographic research in cultural anthropology. Experimental methods are less common in cultural anthropology as they are more typical in fields like experimental psychology or sociology."
