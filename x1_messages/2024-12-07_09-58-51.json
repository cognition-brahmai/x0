        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains moving towards each other from City A and City B, which are 540 km apart. The first train from City A is going at 80 km/h, and the second train from City B is going at 100 km/h. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet.\n\nOkay, so since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. That makes sense because the closer they get, the faster they approach each other. So, the combined speed is 80 km/h plus 100 km/h, which is 180 km/h.\n\nNow, the distance between the two cities is 540 km. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 540 km / 180 km/h\n\nLet me calculate that. 540 divided by 180 is 3. So, the time is 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the first train is going at 80 km/h for 3 hours, it would cover 240 km (since 80 times 3 is 240). The second train is going at 100 km/h for 3 hours, which would cover 300 km (100 times 3 is 300). Now, if I add those distances together, 240 km plus 300 km is 540 km, which is exactly the distance between the two cities.\n\nSo, yes, it seems correct. They meet after 3 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using relative speed.\n\nIf two objects are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, again, 80 km/h plus 100 km/h equals 180 km/h.\n\nThen, the time it takes for them to meet would be the distance divided by the relative speed, which is 540 km divided by 180 km/h, which again gives 3 hours.\n\nAlright, both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
