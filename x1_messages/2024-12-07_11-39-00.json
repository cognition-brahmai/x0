        "content": "So the factory normally produces 500 units of product A in 10 hours. If they increase their production rate by 20%, how many units will they produce in 15 hours? Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the normal production rate per hour. So, if they produce 500 units in 10 hours, their regular rate is 500 units divided by 10 hours, which is 50 units per hour.\n\nNow, they're increasing their production rate by 20%. To find the new production rate, I need to calculate 20% of the original rate and add it to the original rate.\n\n20% of 50 units per hour is 0.20 times 50, which is 10 units per hour. So, the new production rate is 50 units per hour plus 10 units per hour, which equals 60 units per hour.\n\nFinally, to find out how many units they'll produce in 15 hours at this new rate, I multiply the new production rate by the number of hours: 60 units per hour times 15 hours.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 60 times 15 is 900 units.\n\nSo, if the factory increases its production rate by 20%, it will produce 900 units of product A in 15 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
