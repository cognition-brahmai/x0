        "content": "Let's see. So, we have three villagers: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each of them makes a statement:\n\n- Alice says, \"Bob is a liar.\"\n\n- Bob says, \"Carol is a liar.\"\n\n- Carol says, \"Alice and Bob are both liars.\"\n\nAnd we know that at least one of them is a truth-teller. I need to figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibilities for each person being a truth-teller or a liar and see if they consistency with each other.\n\nLet's start by assuming Alice is a truth-teller.\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, then her statement \"Bob is a liar\" must be true. So, Bob is a liar.\n\nIf Bob is a liar, then his statement \"Carol is a liar\" is false. Therefore, Carol is a truth-teller.\n\nNow, if Carol is a truth-teller, her statement \"Alice and Bob are both liars\" must be true. But we already assumed Alice is a truth-teller, which contradicts Carol's statement. Therefore, our initial assumption that Alice is a truth-teller must be false.\n\nSo, Alice is a liar.\n\nAlright, now let's assume that Alice is a liar. Then her statement \"Bob is a liar\" is false, which means Bob is a truth-teller.\n\nIf Bob is a truth-teller, his statement \"Carol is a liar\" is true, so Carol is a liar.\n\nIf Carol is a liar, her statement \"Alice and Bob are both liars\" is false. Now, since we've established that Alice is a liar and Bob is a truth-teller, it means that Alice is indeed a liar, but Bob is not a liar. So, \"Alice and Bob are both liars\" is false, which is consistent with Carol being a liar.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Alice: liar\n\n- Bob: truth-teller\n\n- Carol: liar\n\nThis seems consistent. Let's check if there are any other possibilities.\n\nSuppose that Alice is a liar, Bob is a truth-teller, and Carol is a liar. This matches our earlier conclusion and there are no contradictions.\n\nNow, let's consider if all three could be truth-tellers or all liars.\n\nIf all three are truth-tellers:\n\n- Alice says \"Bob is a liar,\" which would be false, but she's a truth-teller, contradiction.\n\nIf all three are liars:\n\n- Alice says \"Bob is a liar,\" which would be true (since Bob is a liar), but Alice is a liar and should be lying, contradiction.\n\nSo, the only consistent scenario is Alice and Carol are liars, and Bob is a truth-teller.\n\nWait a minute, but let's consider another angle. Suppose Bob is a liar.\n\nIf Bob is a liar, his statement \"Carol is a liar\" is false, so Carol is a truth-teller.\n\nIf Carol is a truth-teller, her statement \"Alice and Bob are both liars\" must be true, so Alice is a liar and Bob is a liar, which matches our assumption that Bob is a liar.\n\nBut if Bob is a liar, and Carol is a truth-teller, then Alice is a liar, as per Carol's statement.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- Alice: liar\n\n- Bob: liar\n\n- Carol: truth-teller\n\nBut hold on, if Bob is a liar, and Carol is a truth-teller, then Alice is a liar, which matches Carol's statement.\n\nHowever, earlier I concluded that Alice is a liar, Bob is a truth-teller, and Carol is a liar.\n\nNow, I have two different scenarios where both seem consistent.\n\nLet's check the first scenario:\n\n1. Alice: liar, Bob: truth-teller, Carol: liar.\n\n2. Alice: liar, Bob: liar, Carol: truth-teller.\n\nBoth seem consistent at first glance, but let's see.\n\nIn the first scenario:\n\n- Alice is a liar, so \"Bob is a liar\" is false, hence Bob is a truth-teller.\n\n- Bob is a truth-teller, so \"Carol is a liar\" is true, hence Carol is a liar.\n\n- Carol is a liar, so \"Alice and Bob are both liars\" is false. Since Alice is a liar and Bob is a truth-teller, indeed, they are not both liars. Consistent.\n\nIn the second scenario:\n\n- Alice is a liar, so \"Bob is a liar\" is false, hence Bob is a truth-teller. Wait, but we assumed Bob is a liar. Contradiction.\n\nWait, in the second scenario, I assumed Bob is a liar, but if Alice is a liar, her statement \"Bob is a liar\" is false, which means Bob is a truth-teller. So, I can't have Bob as a liar in this scenario. There's a contradiction here.\n\nTherefore, the second scenario is invalid. So, the only consistent scenario is:\n\n- Alice: liar\n\n- Bob: truth-teller\n\n- Carol: liar\n\nYes, that seems to be the correct conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice and Carol are liars, and Bob is a truth-teller.}} \\]"
