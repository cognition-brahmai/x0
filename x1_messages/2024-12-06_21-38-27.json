        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about finding out how many students in a class don't play any of the three sports: soccer, basketball, or volleyball. We have a total of 30 students, and we're given the numbers for each sport and their overlaps.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Total students, n = 30\n\n- Students who play soccer, A = 12\n\n- Students who play basketball, B = 14\n\n- Students who play volleyball, C = 16\n\n- Students who play both soccer and basketball, A \u2229 B = 5\n\n- Students who play both soccer and volleyball, A \u2229 C = 6\n\n- Students who play both basketball and volleyball, B \u2229 C = 7\n\n- Students who play all three sports, A \u2229 B \u2229 C = 3\n\nWe need to find the number of students who don't play any of these sports. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many students play at least one sport and then subtract that number from the total number of students.\n\nThe formula for the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 12 + 14 + 16 - 5 - 6 - 7 + 3\n\nLet's calculate that step by step:\n\n12 + 14 = 26\n\n26 + 16 = 42\n\n42 - 5 = 37\n\n37 - 6 = 31\n\n31 - 7 = 24\n\n24 + 3 = 27\n\nSo, 27 students play at least one sport.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play any sport, we subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\nTotal students - |A \u222a B \u222a C| = 30 - 27 = 3\n\nTherefore, 3 students don't play any of these sports.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes with these inclusion-exclusion problems, it's easy to make a mistake in accounting for the overlaps.\n\nLet me verify the inclusion-exclusion formula. The formula adds up all the individual sets, subtracts the pairwise intersections to correct for double-counting, and then adds back the triple intersection because those students have been subtracted too many times.\n\nSo, |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nPlugging in again:\n\n12 + 14 + 16 = 42\n\nThen subtract the pairwise intersections: 42 - 5 - 6 - 7 = 24\n\nThen add back the triple intersection: 24 + 3 = 27\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine three circles overlapping. We need to make sure we're counting each student only once, especially those in multiple intersections.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Only soccer: A - (A \u2229 B) - (A \u2229 C) + (A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 12 - 5 - 6 + 3 = 4\n\n- Only basketball: B - (A \u2229 B) - (B \u2229 C) + (A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 14 - 5 - 7 + 3 = 5\n\n- Only volleyball: C - (A \u2229 C) - (B \u2229 C) + (A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 16 - 6 - 7 + 3 = 6\n\n- Only soccer and basketball: A \u2229 B - A \u2229 B \u2229 C = 5 - 3 = 2\n\n- Only soccer and volleyball: A \u2229 C - A \u2229 B \u2229 C = 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Only basketball and volleyball: B \u2229 C - A \u2229 B \u2229 C = 7 - 3 = 4\n\n- All three sports: A \u2229 B \u2229 C = 3\n\nNow, let's add up all these:\n\nOnly soccer: 4\n\nOnly basketball: 5\n\nOnly volleyball: 6\n\nSoccer and basketball: 2\n\nSoccer and volleyball: 3\n\nBasketball and volleyball: 4\n\nAll three: 3\n\nTotal = 4 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 27\n\nAgain, we get 27 students playing at least one sport.\n\nSubtracting from total students: 30 - 27 = 3\n\nSo, the answer should be 3 students who don't play any sport.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of students being counted incorrectly. For example, are there students who are counted in the pairwise intersections but not in the triple intersection? According to the formula, it seems correctly handled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use a different approach to verify this result. For instance, using the concept of sets and their complements.\n\nThe number of students who don't play any sport is equal to the total number of students minus the number who play at least one sport.\n\nWe've already calculated that as 30 - 27 = 3.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the complement, but that might be more complicated in this case.\n\nGiven that both the direct inclusion-exclusion calculation and the Venn diagram approach give us the same answer, I'm confident that the number of students who don't play any of these sports is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
