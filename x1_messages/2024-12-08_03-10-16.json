Tonight reaction from Hollywood, plus a long list of singers who have died at the young age of 27. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was terrible. I can\\'t understand really what happened. LEMON: Massacre in Norway. A home-grown terrorist kills nearly 100 people. Most of them children gathered at a youth camp. Tonight, the suspect is talking to police. A little girl with a heart of gold instead of asking for birthday presents, she asked that people help children half a world away. Tonight her life comes to a tragic end, but her legacy lives on. Good evening, everyone. I\\'m Don Lemon, live in the CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta. We welcome our viewers tonight who are watching around the world. You\\'re in the CNN NEWSROOM. LEMON: TMZ says this is the last time Amy Winehouse was on stage, three days ago in north London. She supported her 13-year-old goddaughter, an aspiring singer herself. Tonight, the world is mourning the singer blessed with a voice beyond her years, but cursed with addictions that may have cut them short. London police say they do not know what killed the Grammy Award winning singer. They found her today in her apartment. But many are speculating her death is connected to her substance abuse. Well, \"Showbiz Tonight\\'s\" Kareen Wynter joins us now from Los Angeles. Kareen, good evening to you. Winehouse\\'s father is now returning to London. KAREEN WYNTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: Over this tragic news, we just learned that her dad, Mitch Winehouse, he got word of his daughter\\'s death. Listen to this, Don. After he got word, he was in New York, he hopped on a plane back to the UK. It turns out Mitch Winehouse, the aspiring jazz singer was in New York At the time rehearsing Friday with his band getting ready for his big debut here in the states. So he cancelled his upcoming show on Monday, he flew home with his manager who also managed his daughter. Imagine that, Mitch, a former cab driver turned singer flying home tonight to be closer to his daughter, Don. LEMON: Celebrities have been mourning since the news broke, Kareen. What have you been hearing? WYNTER: Well, many stars, are of course sad that she died so young. But I have to say, Don, they\\'re not totally surprised by Winehouse\\'s death, you know, with all her struggles with drugs and alcohol. Listen to what a few had to say. VAL KILMER, ACTOR: The thing about addiction that I learned from playing a bunch of these guys that are addicts is that it\\'s not wrong or bad to want to get out of the pain of mortality. That\\'s what we\\'re trying to do. And a lot of artists are just too sensitive for the world. KELLAN LUTZ, ACTOR: Yes, I just heard about Amy passing away today. I\\'m a big fan of her music. And I don\\'t know her personally, but it\\'s always tragic when someone goes. It\\'s just sad. I mean, she\\'s very well gifted and very talented. WYNTER: Those were actors Kellan Lutz, as well as Val Kilmer. Kilmer, Don, interestingly played singer Jim Morrison in the 1991 film \"The Doors.\" Remember that film? Morrison like Winehouse also died at the age of 27, but the big mystery, Don, in all of this right now is that police don\\'t know how the singer died, if it had anything at all to do with drugs, perhaps alcohol and they say they won\\'t put that piece of the puzzle together until they perform that autopsy which could come as early as tomorrow, Don. LEMON: Kareen, do we know what led police to her body? WYNTER: Well, you know, the circumstances, Don, are still quite bizarre. Paramedics found the singer\\'s body today in her London apartment. We\\'ve all seen the eerie video of paramedics removing her covered body, taken out on a stretcher, placed in a private ambulance. London police say they got a call to head to a home which matched Winehouse\\'s address Saturday afternoon in response to a woman found deceased. She was pronounced dead on the scene. And Don, today, an incredible scene outside the singer\\'s home. Hundreds of people from fans paying respects, to police really trying to contain that area. Many fans are just shocked over this talented singer\\'s short life. An international star who won a handful of Grammy\\'s back in 2008 with that unforgettable album \"Back to Black.\" But her personal demons, they often overshadowed her talent. She was booed off at Belgrade stage during a stumbling performance last month. She did another short stint in rehab after that painful performance, Don, where she checked in and checked right back out of rehab. It really was a story of the latter part of her life. A star with so much promise, who had to battle personal demons in the public eye. Don, one thing, I want to add here, something our producer Denise Kwan found out right before our hit. Interestingly enough, her 2007 worldwide breakthrough album \"Back to Black,\" it\\'s number one right now on Amazon.com as well as iTunes. So you can just imagine all the amazing things that this troubled singer could have done in life if things hadn\\'t ended so tragically. LEMON: Kareen Wynter in Hollywood. Thank you, Kareen. AMY WINEHOUSE, SINGER: My management at the time kind of stepped in and thought they were being the good guys by stepping in and strong -- arming me into a rehabilitation center. But I just didn\\'t really need it. LEMON: That was Amy Winehouse in 2007. Just two months ago, the singer\\'s staff issued a statement saying they were doing everything they could to, quote, \"Return her to her best,\" after she cut short her European tour. Celebrity addicts often don\\'t give themselves enough time to recover. That\\'s according to Dr. Drew who is from our sister network, HLN. DR. DREW PINSKY, HOST, \"DR. DREW\": When an opiate addict goes into treatment, opiate addiction takes months to years to treat. And one of the most serious risks in my experience to that recovery for celebrities and particularly musicians, is they return to their career, they return to the road far to prematurely and it\\'s absolutely predictable what will happen. The fact is, you know, funny thing, people look at these stories and go oh, addiction treatment doesn\\'t work. The crazy thing about addiction is part of the disease is a disturbance of thinking, where the addict themselves convinces themselves they don\\'t need to listen to or do what they\\'re being told to do. And if they simply do the recovery process on a daily basis, just simply do it, they will be fine just the way a diabetic is fine if they take their insulin three times a day. LEMON: Again, police say Winehouse\\' cause of death is, quote, \"unexplained.\" EDWARD FORNES, SURVIVOR OF NORWAY RAMPAGE: I ran around for five minutes, then I started swimming. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Was he shooting at you in the ocean? FORNES: Yes, and he missed it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Were people around you hit? FORNES: Yes. LEMON: That young man escaped with his life, but so many others did not. Two attacks in Norway. At least 92 people dead, 85 of them at a youth camp and seven in the bombing in the capital Oslo. So far one man arrested and charged in both attacks. That man identified by local media as Anders Behring Breivik, 32 years old, described as a right winger, a Christian fundamentalist, but police now say they haven\\'t ruled out the possibility that others were involved. A man who identified himself as Breivik\\'s attorney spoke to Norwegian Broadcaster TV 2. He says, \"Breivik believes the terrorist attacks were horrible but, quote, \"In his head, they were necessary.\" That attorney also promises Breivik will explain himself at a hearing on Monday. The accounts from the youth camp and Utoya are chilling. Witnesses say a man showed up in a police uniform reportedly he asked the campers to gather around and started firing with a machine pistol. Because the camp is run by Norway\\'s ruling Labor Party, investigators believe this attack could have been politically motivated. The camp attack followed a car bombing outside a government building not far away in Oslo. A witness says she saw Breivik buy six tons of fertilizer in May. That material may be used to make bombs. For Norway\\'s prime minister, this was more than an assault against his country as CNN Jim Boulden reports, he has a very personal connection to this tragedy. JIM BOULDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In an early morning press conference, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said he feared he would know some of the young people killed on the island he visited every year since 1974. JENS STOLTENBERG, NORWEGIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): It is especially heavy when it is people I know. And I know quite a few of those who lost their lives. I know their parents or several others who lost their lives. And this happened in a place where I became politically active and I said earlier today that it was a paradise for youngsters, and yesterday, it turned into hell. BOULDEN: The prime minister called a meeting of his cabinet Saturday. There were a number of government buildings badly damaged Friday. The prime minister called on all Norwegians to do what they can: to aid those affected by the biggest one day of killing in the country since the Second World War. LEMON: Well, for some of the victims, it was over before they knew what was happening. Others were hunted. The gunman taking his time, stalking them down and the survivors as Diana Magnay reports are still fighting through their shock. DIANA MAGNAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Young survivors sob in each other\\'s arms. The prime minister tries to console the inconsolable. As police and the Red Cross continued their search for the dead, those who survived tell of the horror they witnessed. The killing spree where a lone gunman was able to fire for 19 minutes unchecked. OTTAR FAGERHEIM, SURVIVOR: He seemed calm and he seemed like he was just taking photos when he was shooting people. MAGNAY: What was he wearing? What was he wearing? FORNES: He was wearing fake police uniform. It looked like a saloon rifle. MAGNAY: And his expression, it was blank? FORNES: Completely blank. MAGNAY: But he was shouting? FORNES: Yes, come back. MAGNAY: Come back to those swimming for their lives as he fired in their wake. Many were hit. Boats now troll the water for their bodies. For others the water was the only place to hide. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I started swimming onto the shores, and then got halfway and then I got cramps because I have been laying so long in the water so I got some of the locals saved my life with. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you can hide in the water? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, because it\\'s the only place to hide. All the other places were full of people. MAGNAY: Hundreds of young people had gathered here for a political summer camp, a tradition of the ruling Labor Party which the prime minister attended in his youth. STOLTENBERG (through translator): What was my youth paradise has been turned into a hell for all of the people that were involved yesterday. It has made a major impression in the meetings, to meet the people that survived and the people that got ashore. MAGNAY: Young people determined not to let this nightmare break them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s important that we stay together and keep strong. We can\\'t let a coward like that stop us. Because going on to an island with only youth and killing them, and they have no way to escape, that\\'s a cowardness act. MAGNAY: Diana Magnay, CNN near Utoya Island, Norway. LEMON: They\\'re running out of time to raise the debt ceiling. A late Saturday meeting was held without the president. Was any progress made on the debt ceiling negotiations? And this guy has got the right idea, but when will the rest of us get to cool off from the extreme heat going on across the nation? A live weather forecast is straight ahead.
