        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a construction company building a large shopping mall. They've got two years to complete the project, and they're estimating that they'll need about 200,000 hours of labor. The workers will be working in 8-hour shifts, and there are three categories of workers: skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled, with hourly wages of $30, $20, and $15 respectively. The company wants to maintain a ratio of 2:3:5 for skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers. I need to determine how many workers are needed in each category and then calculate the total labor cost for the project.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many total worker shifts are required. Since each shift is 8 hours, and they need 200,000 hours in total, I can calculate the number of shifts by dividing the total hours by the hours per shift.\n\nTotal shifts = Total hours / Hours per shift\n             = 200,000 hours / 8 hours(shift)\n             = 25,000 shifts\n\nSo, there are 25,000 shifts needed in total.\n\nNow, these shifts need to be distributed among the three categories of workers in the ratio of 2:3:5 for skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers respectively.\n\nLet's denote the number of shifts for skilled workers as 2x, for semi-skilled as 3x, and for unskilled as 5x. The sum of these should equal the total shifts.\n\n2x + 3x + 5x = 25,000 shifts\n10x = 25,000 shifts\nx = 2,500 shifts\n\nNow, I can find the number of shifts for each category:\n\nSkilled: 2x = 2 * 2,500 = 5,000 shifts\nSemi-skilled: 3x = 3 * 2,500 = 7,500 shifts\nUnskilled: 5x = 5 * 2,500 = 12,500 shifts\n\nNext, I need to find out how many workers are needed in each category. Since each shift is 8 hours, and assuming each worker works one shift per day, I need to consider the number of days in two years to find out how many workers are needed.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days in two years. Assuming it's not a leap year:\n\nDays per year = 365 days\nTotal days = 2 * 365 = 730 days\n\nNow, if each worker works one shift per day, then the number of shifts a single worker can complete in two years is equal to the number of days in two years, which is 730 shifts per worker.\n\nHowever, this seems too high because typically workers don't work every single day for two years without any days off. So, I need to account for weekends and holidays.\n\nAssuming a standard 5-day workweek, with weekends off:\n\nWorkdays per week = 5 days\nTotal workdays in two years = 5 days/week * 52 weeks/year * 2 years\n                            = 5 * 52 * 2\n                            = 520 days\n\nAdditionally, there might be public holidays or other non-working days. Let's assume there are 10 public holidays per year.\n\nTotal public holidays in two years = 10 holidays/year * 2 years = 20 holidays\n\nSo, total workdays in two years = 520 days - 20 holidays = 500 days\n\nTherefore, each worker can work up to 500 shifts in two years.\n\nNow, I can calculate the number of workers needed in each category by dividing the total shifts required by the number of shifts one worker can work.\n\nNumber of skilled workers = Total skilled shifts / Shifts per worker\n                          = 5,000 shifts / 500 shifts/worker\n                          = 10 workers\n\nSimilarly,\n\nNumber of semi-skilled workers = 7,500 shifts / 500 shifts/worker\n                               = 15 workers\n\nNumber of unskilled workers = 12,500 shifts / 500 shifts/worker\n                            = 25 workers\n\nSo, the company needs 10 skilled workers, 15 semi-skilled workers, and 25 unskilled workers.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total labor cost for the project.\n\nFirst, find the total hours worked by each category:\n\nSkilled: 5,000 shifts * 8 hours/shift = 40,000 hours\nSemi-skilled: 7,500 shifts * 8 hours/shift = 60,000 hours\nUnskilled: 12,500 shifts * 8 hours/shift = 100,000 hours\n\nNext, calculate the labor cost for each category:\n\nSkilled cost = 40,000 hours * $30/hour = $1,200,000\nSemi-skilled cost = 60,000 hours * $20/hour = $1,200,000\nUnskilled cost = 100,000 hours * $15/hour = $1,500,000\n\nNow, sum these up to get the total labor cost:\n\nTotal labor cost = Skilled cost + Semi-skilled cost + Unskilled cost\n                 = $1,200,000 + $1,200,000 + $1,500,000\n                 = $3,900,000\n\nTherefore, the total labor cost for the project is $3,900,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe number of workers needed are 10 skilled, 15 semi-skilled, and 25 unskilled workers, with a total labor cost of $\\boxed{3900000}$."
