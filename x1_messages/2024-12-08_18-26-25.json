First, I need to calculate the exponentiation, then subtraction, multiplication, addition, and finally division, following the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\nSo, starting with the exponentiation:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow, subtract 1 from that:\n\n16 - 1 = 15\n\nNext, multiply by 6:\n\n15 * 6 = 90\n\nThen, add 12:\n\n90 + 12 = 102\n\nFinally, divide by 3:\n\n102 / 3 = 34\n\nSo, the answer is 34."
