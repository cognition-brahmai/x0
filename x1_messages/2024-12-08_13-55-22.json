        "content": "Let's see. I start with $50. I need to buy 3 books, and each book costs $12. So first, I should find out how much all three books cost together.\n\nIf one book is $12, then three books would be 3 times $12. Let me calculate that: 3 \u00d7 12 equals 36. So, the total cost for the books is $36.\n\nNow, I need to subtract that amount from the $50 I have to find out how much money I have left. So, $50 minus $36.\n\nLet me do the subtraction: 50 minus 36 is 14.\n\nTherefore, after buying the three books, I have $14 left.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can do it another way to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to subtract the cost of each book one by one from the $50.\n\nStarting with $50:\n\nFirst book: $50 minus $12 is $38.\n\nSecond book: $38 minus $12 is $26.\n\nThird book: $26 minus $12 is $14.\n\nAgain, I get $14 left.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of total money and total expenditure.\n\nTotal money: $50\n\nTotal expenditure: 3 books \u00d7 $12 each = $36\n\nMoney left: $50 - $36 = $14\n\nYes, it seems consistent. I can also consider if there's any tax or additional costs, but since nothing else is mentioned, I'll assume that the cost is just $12 per book with no additional fees.\n\nSo, final answer: $14 left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
