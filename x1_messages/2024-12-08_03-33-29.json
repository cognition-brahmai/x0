        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from Town A to Town B. It goes at 60 mph, takes a 30-minute break in Town C, which is halfway between A and B, and the total travel time including the break is 3 hours. I need to find the distance between Town A and Town B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the journey. The train goes from A to C, takes a break, and then goes from C to B. Since C is halfway, the distance from A to C is the same as from C to B.\n\nLet me denote the distance from A to C as D. Therefore, the total distance from A to B is 2D.\n\nThe speed of the train is 60 mph, so the time to travel from A to C is D / 60 hours, and the time from C to B is also D / 60 hours.\n\nThere's a 30-minute break in Town C. I need to make sure that all units are consistent. Since the speed is in mph and the total time is in hours, I'll convert 30 minutes to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.\n\nSo, the total travel time is the time from A to C, plus the break, plus the time from C to B:\n\nTotal time = (D / 60) + 0.5 + (D / 60) = 3 hours.\n\nCombining the terms:\n\n(2D / 60) + 0.5 = 3\n\nNow, I can solve for D.\n\nFirst, subtract 0.5 from both sides:\n\n(2D / 60) = 2.5\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 60:\n\n2D = 2.5 * 60\n\n2D = 150\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nD = 75 miles\n\nSince the total distance from A to B is 2D, that would be 150 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf D is 75 miles, then time from A to C is 75 / 60 = 1.25 hours.\n\nBreak is 0.5 hours.\n\nTime from C to B is another 1.25 hours.\n\nTotal time: 1.25 + 0.5 + 1.25 = 3 hours, which matches the given total travel time.\n\nSo, the distance between Town A and Town B is 150 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
