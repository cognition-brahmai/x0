        "content": "To find out how far the cyclist travels, we can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nGiven that the cyclist's average speed is 15 miles per hour (mph) and the time spent cycling is 45 minutes, we need to make sure that the units for time are compatible with the units for speed. Since speed is given in miles per hour, it would be best to convert the time from minutes to hours.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time in hours} = \\frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, plugging the values into the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 15 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 0.75 \\, \\text{hours} = 11.25 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cyclist travels 11.25 miles in 45 minutes at an average speed of 15 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.25 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
