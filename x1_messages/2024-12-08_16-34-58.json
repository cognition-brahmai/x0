        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to fence the entire field but needs to leave a 5-meter gap on each side for entry and exit. Let's figure out how much fencing he'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. Since it's a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. The lengths are 120 meters each, and the widths are 80 meters each. So, without any gaps, the total perimeter would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) = 2 \\times (120 + 80) = 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nBut there are gaps to consider. He wants to leave a 5-meter gap on each side. Now, the term \"each side\" could be a bit ambiguous. Does that mean a 5-meter gap on each of the four sides, or a total of five meters per side?\n\nLet me clarify: \"each side\" likely means each of the four sides of the rectangle. So, two lengths and two widths, each with a 5-meter gap.\n\nSo, for each length of 120 meters, there's a 5-meter gap, and for each width of 80 meters, there's also a 5-meter gap.\n\nTherefore, the total fencing required would be the perimeter minus the total gaps.\n\nTotal gaps = 5 meters x 4 sides = 20 meters.\n\nSo, total fencing required = 400 meters - 20 meters = 380 meters.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe \"each side\" means that on each length and each width, there is one 5-meter gap.\n\nSo, on one length, one 5-meter gap; on the other length, another 5-meter gap; same for the widths.\n\nThat would still be four gaps in total, so the calculation remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"each side\" means that on each length, there are two gaps, one at each end, but that would be more than five meters per side, which doesn't align with the problem statement.\n\nNo, I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the fence required is 380 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{380} \\]"
