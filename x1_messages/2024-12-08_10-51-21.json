        "content": "The derivative of e^(3x) with respect to x is 3e^(3x). This is because e^(3x) is an exponential function with base e and exponent 3x. When differentiating such a function, we apply the chain rule, which states that the derivative is equal to the derivative of the outer function multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is e^u, where u=3x, and the inner function is u=3x. The derivative of e^u with respect to u is e^u, and the derivative of 3x with respect to x is 3. Therefore, the derivative of e^(3x) is e^(3x) multiplied by 3, which simplifies to 3e^(3x)."
