Let's see how I can use these step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably start with WikiLookup since Wikipedia is a good source for getting a general overview of a topic. So, I'll input \"photosynthesis\" into WikiLookup.\n\nStep 1: Use WikiLookup[\"photosynthesis\"] to get a general overview of photosynthesis.\n\nOnce I have that page, I can read through it to understand the basic concepts. But since I might not need all the information on the page, I can use TextAnalyzer to extract the key points.\n\nStep 2: Use TextAnalyzer on the output of WikiLookup to extract key points about photosynthesis.\n\nThis should give me a summarized version of how photosynthesis works. However, to get a more detailed understanding, I might need to look at additional resources. That's where WebCrawler can be useful. I can use WebCrawler to find more pages that explain photosynthesis in depth.\n\nStep 3: Use WebCrawler[\"photosynthesis in plants\"] to find additional relevant pages.\n\nAfter crawling the web, I'll have a list of pages that talk about photosynthesis in plants. I should pick a few reputable sources from this list and analyze their content using TextAnalyzer.\n\nStep 4: Select a few pages from the WebCrawler output and use TextAnalyzer on each to extract key points.\n\nNow, I have information from both Wikipedia and other reputable sources. To organize all this information and answer the question \"How does photosynthesis work in plants?\" I can use the QAModel. I'll provide the extracted key points from both WikiLookup and WebCrawler as the input context.\n\nStep 5: Compile the key points from Step 2 and Step 4 into a single context.\n\nStep 6: Use QAModel with the compiled context to answer \"How does photosynthesis work in plants?\"\n\nThis should give me a comprehensive answer based on the information gathered from various sources. If there are any specific aspects or details that are unclear, I can iterate the process by searching for more information on those points.\n\nAlternative Step: If after Step 6, there are still unclear points, repeat Steps 1-6 for those specific subtopics related to photosynthesis.\n\nBut for now, this plan should help me understand and explain how photosynthesis works in plants."
