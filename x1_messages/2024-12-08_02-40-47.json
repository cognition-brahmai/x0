        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you calculate the compound interest earned on a principal amount of $1,000 invested at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded annually for 3 years. We'll use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nGiven the values:\n\n- \\( P = 1000 \\) dollars\n\n- \\( r = 5\\% = 0.05 \\) (as a decimal)\n\n- \\( n = 1 \\) (since the interest is compounded annually)\n\n- \\( t = 3 \\) years\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula step by step.\n\nFirst, substitute the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{1}\\right)^{1 \\times 3} \\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ A = 1000 \\left(1 + 0.05\\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 1000 \\left(1.05\\right)^3 \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( (1.05)^3 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.05 \\times 1.05 = 1.1025 \\]\n\nThen, multiply the result by 1.05 again:\n\n\\[ 1.1025 \\times 1.05 = 1.157625 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A = 1000 \\times 1.157625 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 1157.625 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount after 3 years is $1,157.63 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nTo find the compound interest earned, subtract the principal amount from the total amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = A - P \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = 1157.63 - 1000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Compound Interest} = 157.63 \\]\n\nSo, the compound interest earned is $157.63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{157.63} \\]"
