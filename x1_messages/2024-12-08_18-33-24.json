        "content": "I've got this riddle here: \"Lighter than what I am made of, More of me is hidden Than is seen.\" Hmm, let's see. Riddles are all about playing with words and looking for clever connections, so I need to think outside the box here.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"lighter than what I am made of\" is interesting. It suggests that whatever this object is, it has less mass or density compared to the material it's composed of. Wait, that sounds a bit paradoxical because usually, something is as heavy as its components. So maybe it's not about physical weight but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"lighter\" refers to brightness or luminosity rather than weight. But that might not fit well with the second part of the riddle.\n\nLet me consider some examples. For instance, a balloon: it's filled with light gases like helium, which are lighter than air, but the material it's made of, like rubber, is heavier. But that doesn't quite fit the riddle because the balloon itself isn't lighter than the rubber it's made of; it's the gas inside that's lighter than air.\n\nWait, maybe it's something like icebergs. Icebergs are made of ice, which is lighter than water, so they float. But ice is made from water, which is its component, so in a way, ice is lighter than its constituent in liquid form. And we know that most of an iceberg is hidden beneath the water, with only a small part visible above the surface. That seems promising.\n\nSo, iceberg: made of ice, which is lighter than water, and most of it is hidden beneath the water surface. But the riddle says \"lighter than what I am made of,\" and ice is lighter than water, but ice is made of water. Is water the material it's made of? Yes, water frozen into ice. So that could work.\n\nBut maybe there are other answers. Let's think of something else.\n\nHow about a hot air balloon? It's made of fabric and has hot air inside, which is lighter than the cool air outside. Most of the balloon's volume is the air bag, which is filled with hot air, and only a small part is the basket and the burner, which are visible. So, more of it is hidden (the air bag) than seen (the basket). But again, the material it's made of is the fabric, and hot air isn't heavier or lighter than fabric; it's the density difference that makes it float.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps it's not about physical objects but about concepts or ideas.\n\nTake, for example, an iceberg in a more abstract sense. In project management, there's the \"iceberg model,\" where only a small part of a project is visible, and most of the work is hidden beneath the surface. But that might be stretching it.\n\nAlternatively, think about ice cubes in a glass. The ice cubes are made of water, which is lighter in solid form, and most of the ice cube is hidden beneath the water level. But that's similar to the iceberg example.\n\nMaybe it's something else entirely. Let's consider something like a mountain. Mountains are made of earth and rock, which are heavy, but perhaps if there's a mountain made of pumice or some other lightweight material, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, what about a boat? A boat is made of materials like wood or metal, which might be heavier than water, but it's designed to float because its overall density is less than water. However, in this case, the boat is not lighter than what it's made of; it's the shape and the air inside that make it float.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet's look at the second part of the riddle: \"more of me is hidden than is seen.\" This suggests that only a portion of the object is visible, and a larger portion is not visible or hidden from view.\n\nGoing back to the iceberg example, that fits well because only about 10% of an iceberg is visible above water, and 90% is hidden beneath the surface.\n\nAlso, ice is indeed lighter than water, which is why it floats. So, in a way, ice is lighter than water, even though it's made from water.\n\nBut let's see if there are other possibilities.\n\nWhat about a mountain range with extensive cave systems inside the mountains? The caves would be hidden, and only the outer surface is seen. However, caves are hollow spaces, not made of any particular material heavier or lighter than the mountain itself.\n\nAnother idea: a iceberg again, but thinking differently. Ice is less dense than water, so it floats. Similarly, foam is less dense than the material it's made of in its solid form. For example, foam rubber is less dense than solid rubber.\n\nBut foam is composed of gas filled pockets within a solid matrix, so its overall density is reduced. So, more of the foam is hidden within, say, a package, and only the surface is seen.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to fit the riddle as well as the iceberg example.\n\nAlternatively, think about a balloon again, but this time a balloon filled with helium. The balloon material is rubber or latex, which is heavier than air, but the helium inside is lighter than air, so the balloon floats. However, the material it's made of is heavier than the gas inside, so it's not lighter than what it's made of.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about something that is made of a heavy material but is designed to be lightweight.\n\nLike a bicycle, made of light alloys, but that doesn't really fit because the bicycle itself isn't lighter than its materials; it's the choice of materials that makes it light.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps it's something like a feather. A feather is light because of its structure, but it's made of keratin, which is denser. But feathers are actually composed of lightweight materials that make them float in air.\n\nWait, but feathers are not lighter than their constituent materials; they are constructed in a way that makes them lightweight.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider the first part of the riddle: \"Lighter than what I am made of.\"\n\nThis suggests that the object has less mass or density than the materials it's composed of in their standard form.\n\nSo, perhaps it's a structure that incorporates a lot of empty space, like a building with hollow walls or something like that.\n\nWait, but buildings are typically heavier than their materials because they use a lot of materials to construct them.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's air or gas contained within something. For example, a inflated balloon is lighter than the rubber it's made of because the air inside is less dense than the rubber.\n\nBut again, the balloon as a whole is lighter than the rubber alone, but the rubber is heavier than air.\n\nI need to find something where the overall object is lighter than the material it's made of.\n\nThis seems paradoxical because the object is made of its materials, so its weight should be the sum of its parts.\n\nUnless there's a lot of empty space or it's designed in a way that minimizes weight.\n\nWait, maybe it's a wooden boat. Wood is heavier than water, but when shaped into a boat and hollowed out, it can float because the overall density is less than water.\n\nBut is the boat lighter than the wood it's made of? No, because you've removed some wood to make it hollow.\n\nWait, no. If you have a solid block of wood, it displaces water equal to its weight, but if you make it hollow, it can displace more water and float even if it's heavier than water.\n\nBut still, the boat as a whole is not lighter than the wood it's made of; it's just designed to displace enough water to float.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try another angle. Perhaps it's not a physical object but an abstract concept.\n\nFor example, reputation. Reputation is \"lighter\" than the actions that build it because only a part of one's actions are visible to others, and much is hidden.\n\nBut that seems forced.\n\nAlternatively, think about ice cubes in a drink. The ice cubes are made of water, which in liquid form is denser than ice. So ice is lighter than water, which is what it's made of.\n\nWait, but water freezes into ice, which expands and becomes less dense. So ice is indeed lighter than water, which is why it floats.\n\nSo, in this case, ice is made of water, but it's lighter than water in its liquid form.\n\nAnd, in a glass of water with ice cubes, most of the ice is hidden beneath the surface, with only a small part visible above the water.\n\nThis seems to fit both parts of the riddle.\n\nSo, the answer could be ice.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of icebergs, which are also made of ice and have most of their mass hidden beneath the water.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is ice or icebergs.\n\nBut maybe there's a more general answer.\n\nLet's consider any floating object. By Archimedes' principle, a floating object displaces an amount of fluid equal to its own weight.\n\nSo, if an object is floating, the volume that's submerged is proportional to its weight.\n\nIf an object is less dense than the fluid, it will float with a portion submerged.\n\nThe fraction submerged is equal to the ratio of the object's density to the fluid's density.\n\nSo, if something is less dense than the fluid, more of it is hidden (submerged) than is seen (above water).\n\nWait, no. Actually, the submerged part is the part that displaces the water equal to the object's weight.\n\nSo, if the object is less dense than water, it will float with more of it above water, not submerged.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting my buoyancy principles mixed up.\n\nLet me recall: if an object's density is less than the fluid's density, it will float with part of it above the fluid.\n\nThe fraction of the object that is submerged is equal to the ratio of the object's density to the fluid's density.\n\nSo, for example, if the object's density is half that of the fluid, then half of it will be submerged, and half will be above.\n\nWait, but in the riddle, it says \"more of me is hidden than is seen,\" which would mean that more than half is submerged.\n\nSo, if more than half is submerged, that would mean the object's density is less than the fluid's density but greater than half of it.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nIf the object's density is less than the fluid's density, it will float with a portion submerged such that the weight of the displaced fluid equals the weight of the object.\n\nSo, the submerged volume V_submerged = object's weight / fluid's density.\n\nThe total volume V_total = V_submerged / (object's density / fluid's density).\n\nTherefore, the fraction submerged F_submerged = V_submerged / V_total = object's density / fluid's density.\n\nSo, if the object's density is less than the fluid's density, F_submerged < 1.\n\nAnd if F_submerged > 0.5, that would mean object's density / fluid's density > 0.5, or object's density > 0.5 * fluid's density.\n\nSo, in other words, the object's density is less than the fluid's density but more than half of it.\n\nTherefore, for more of the object to be hidden (submerged) than seen (above water), its density needs to be between 0.5 and 1 times the fluid's density.\n\nApplying this to the riddle, if the fluid is water, then the object's density needs to be between 0.5 and 1 times that of water.\n\nSo, any object with density between 0.5 and 1 times that of water would float with more of it hidden than seen.\n\nIce has a density of about 0.92 times that of water, so roughly 92% is submerged and 8% is above water.\n\nSo, ice fits this condition.\n\nBut are there other materials or objects that have densities between 0.5 and 1 times that of water?\n\nYes, for example, some types of wood like cork have lower densities and would float with more of them above water.\n\nBut ice is a common example that fits well.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer to the riddle is ice or icebergs.\n\nSo, the answer is ice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{ice}} \\]"
