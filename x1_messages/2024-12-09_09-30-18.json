        "content": "So I have this problem here about a rectangular garden. The original dimensions are 30 meters in length and 20 meters in width. The task is to increase the area by 50%, but the width stays the same, and I need to find out what the new length should be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current area is. For a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, the original area is 30 meters times 20 meters, which is 600 square meters.\n\nNow, I need to increase this area by 50%. To find out what 50% of 600 square meters is, I can calculate 0.5 times 600, which is 300 square meters. So, the new area should be the original area plus this increase, which is 600 plus 300, equaling 900 square meters.\n\nThe problem states that the width remains unchanged, so the width is still 20 meters. I need to find the new length that, when multiplied by 20 meters, gives me an area of 900 square meters.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the new length as L. So, the equation would be:\n\nL times 20 meters = 900 square meters\n\nTo find L, I can divide both sides of the equation by 20 meters:\n\nL = 900 square meters / 20 meters\n\nWhen I do this division, the units of meters in the denominator and numerator will cancel out, leaving me with just meters as the unit for length.\n\nSo, L = 900 / 20 = 45 meters\n\nTherefore, the new length should be 45 meters to increase the area by 50% while keeping the width the same.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that increasing the area by 50% while keeping the width the same means that only the length is changing. Since area is length times width, and width is constant, the length must be increased by the same proportion needed to increase the area.\n\nSo, if I want the area to be 1.5 times the original area, and the width is unchanged, then the length needs to be 1.5 times the original length.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let\u2019s see.\n\nOriginal area A = L \u00d7 W\n\nNew area A' = L' \u00d7 W\n\nGiven that A' = 1.5 \u00d7 A and W' = W, then:\n\nL' \u00d7 W = 1.5 \u00d7 (L \u00d7 W)\n\nDividing both sides by W:\n\nL' = 1.5 \u00d7 L\n\nSo, L' = 1.5 \u00d7 30 meters = 45 meters\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of proportions. The area is proportional to the product of length and width. Since width is constant, the area is directly proportional to the length.\n\nTherefore, if I want the area to increase by 50%, I need to increase the length by 50% as well.\n\nAgain, this aligns with my previous result.\n\nLet me consider if there\u2019s another way this could be interpreted. Is it possible that the width doesn\u2019t remain exactly the same, but changes in some other way? The problem clearly states that the width remains unchanged, so I can be confident that it stays at 20 meters.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no unit conversions or other factors to consider. All measurements are in meters, so no conversion is needed.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can calculate the original and new areas to confirm the increase.\n\nOriginal area: 30 m \u00d7 20 m = 600 m\u00b2\n\nNew area: 45 m \u00d7 20 m = 900 m\u00b2\n\nIncrease in area: 900 m\u00b2 - 600 m\u00b2 = 300 m\u00b2\n\nPercentage increase: (300 m\u00b2 / 600 m\u00b2) \u00d7 100% = 50%\n\nThis confirms that the area has indeed increased by 50%.\n\nI think this is straightforward, but it\u2019s always good to double-check calculations, especially when dealing with proportions and percentages.\n\nAnother angle to consider: if both dimensions were to change, but in this case, the problem specifies that only the length changes while the width remains the same. So, I don\u2019t need to worry about changing the width.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent is important. In this problem, all units are in meters, so that\u2019s straightforward.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to bring in more complex concepts like calculus or anything beyond basic geometry for this problem.\n\nIn summary, to increase the area of the garden by 50% while keeping the width unchanged, the new length should be 45 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
