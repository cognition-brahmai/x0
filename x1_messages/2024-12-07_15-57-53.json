        "content": "Let's see. I need to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 10 and 20. So, first, I should identify which numbers are even in that range.\n\nStarting from 10 up to 20, the even numbers are: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. Okay, so those are the numbers I need to add together.\n\nLet me write them down: 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20.\n\nNow, I can add them one by one, but that might take a bit of time. Is there a faster way to do this?\n\nI remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: sum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (first term + last term)/2.\n\nWait, does that apply here? Let's check if these numbers form an arithmetic series.\n\nAn arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the difference between consecutive even numbers is 2, which is constant. So yes, this is an arithmetic series.\n\nGreat, so I can use that formula to find the sum.\n\nFirst, I need to find the number of terms. Let's see, starting from 10 to 20 with a common difference of 2.\n\nTo find the number of terms, I can use the formula: number of terms = (last term - first term)/common difference + 1.\n\nPlugging in the values: number of terms = (20 - 10)/2 + 1 = (10)/2 + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 terms.\n\nNow, using the sum formula: sum = number of terms \u00d7 (first term + last term)/2.\n\nPlugging in the values: sum = 6 \u00d7 (10 + 20)/2 = 6 \u00d7 (30)/2 = 6 \u00d7 15 = 90.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check by adding them manually.\n\n10 + 12 = 22\n\n22 + 14 = 36\n\n36 + 16 = 52\n\n52 + 18 = 70\n\n70 + 20 = 90\n\nYes, that matches the sum I got using the formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of the first n even numbers, but since the sequence starts from 10, which is not the first even number, I think using the arithmetic series formula is more appropriate here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nI know that the sum of the first n even numbers is n(n+1).\n\nBut in this case, the sequence doesn't start from 2, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the even numbers between 10 and 20 as 2 times some sequence of integers.\n\nLet's see, 10 is 2\u00d75, 12 is 2\u00d76, 14 is 2\u00d77, 16 is 2\u00d78, 18 is 2\u00d79, and 20 is 2\u00d710.\n\nSo, the sum can be written as 2\u00d7(5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10).\n\nNow, sum inside the parentheses is 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10.\n\nI can calculate that directly: 5 + 6 = 11, 11 + 7 = 18, 18 + 8 = 26, 26 + 9 = 35, 35 + 10 = 45.\n\nThen, multiply by 2: 2\u00d745 = 90.\n\nAgain, I get 90.\n\nThis matches the previous result, so I'm confident that's the correct sum.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series again, but this time without counting the number of terms.\n\nThe formula is also: sum = [(first term + last term) \u00d7 number of terms]/2.\n\nBut I already used that and got 90.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula: sum = n/2 \u00d7 [2a + (n-1)d], where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nn = 6 (as previously calculated), a = 10, d = 2.\n\nPlugging in: sum = 6/2 \u00d7 [2\u00d710 + (6-1)\u00d72] = 3 \u00d7 [20 + 10] = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90.\n\nOnce again, 90.\n\nIt seems like no matter which method I use, I end up with 90.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all even numbers between 10 and 20 is 90.\n\nBut wait a minute, the question says \"between 10 and 20\", which might imply that 10 and 20 are not included.\n\nI need to check the wording.\n\nIt says \"between 10 and 20\", so does that include 10 and 20 or not?\n\nIn mathematics, \"between\" can sometimes be interpreted differently.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if \"between 10 and 20\" includes 10 and 20, then the even numbers are 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and the sum is 90.\n\nSecond, if \"between 10 and 20\" excludes 10 and 20, then the even numbers are 12, 14, 16, 18, and the sum is 12 + 14 = 26, 26 + 16 = 42, 42 + 18 = 60.\n\nSo, in that case, the sum would be 60.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation is correct.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 10 and 20.\"\n\nIn everyday language, \"between 10 and 20\" often includes 10 and 20.\n\nHowever, in mathematics, sometimes \"between a and b\" means strictly greater than a and strictly less than b.\n\nTo be safe, I should consider both possibilities.\n\nBut given that the problem is about even numbers, and 10 and 20 are even, it's likely that they are intended to be included.\n\nMoreover, in programming or mathematics, unless specified otherwise, \"between a and b\" includes a and b.\n\nTherefore, I will assume that 10 and 20 are included.\n\nHence, the sum is 90.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"between 10 and 20\" excludes 10 and 20, then the sum would be 60.\n\nBut based on standard interpretation, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the context.\n\nThe problem is to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 10 and 20.\n\nIf it's a mathematical problem, it's likely that \"between\" includes the endpoints.\n\nIf it's a programming problem, it might exclude the endpoints.\n\nBut since it's a general problem, I'll go with including the endpoints.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 90.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"between 10 and 20\" excludes 10 and 20, then the even numbers are 12, 14, 16, 18, and the sum is 60.\n\nBut I think the standard interpretation includes the endpoints.\n\nHence, the sum is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
