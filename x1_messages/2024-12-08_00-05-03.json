        "content": "I'm trying to recall who that could be. In 2020, there were several Grammy-winning singer-songwriters who might have released a new album and were involved with NBC's The Voice. Let me think about the coaches on The Voice that year. There was Blake Shelton, Adam Levine, Gwen Stefani, and maybe Kelly Clarkson. Wait, Kelly Clarkson is a Grammy winner and has been a coach on The Voice.\n\nLet me check how many studio albums Kelly Clarkson has. I think she's released around eight or nine albums by 2020. Her eighth studio album was \"Kelly Clarkson Album\" released in 2015, and then \"Norman Fucking Rockwell\" in 2019, which might be her ninth. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it was Lady Gaga. She's a Grammy winner, but I don't think she was a coach on The Voice in 2020. Maybe Blake Shelton? He's a coach on The Voice and has released many albums, but I'm not sure about the exact count in 2020.\n\nWait, maybe it was Jennifer Hudson. She's a Grammy winner and has been a coach on The Voice, but I'm not sure about the album release in 2020.\n\nLet me try to find more specific information. In 2020, one of the coaches on The Voice was John Legend. He's a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter. Let's see about his album releases. His eighth studio album is \"A Legendary Christmas,\" but that's a Christmas album. His seventh studio album is \"Darkness and Light,\" released in 2016. So, in 2020, he released \"Bigger Love,\" which was his eighth studio album.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. John Legend released his eighth studio album \"Bigger Love\" in 2020 while he was serving as a coach on NBC's The Voice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{John Legend}} \\]"
