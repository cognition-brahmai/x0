        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 800 students in total, and 60% of them are girls. We need to figure out how many more boys need to enroll for the ratio of boys to girls to be exactly 1:1.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how many girls there are. Since 60% of the students are girls, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 800.\n\nNumber of girls = 60% of 800 = 0.60 \u00d7 800 = 480 girls.\n\nNow, to find out how many boys there are currently, I'll subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.\n\nNumber of boys = Total students - Number of girls = 800 - 480 = 320 boys.\n\nSo, right now, there are 320 boys and 480 girls.\n\nThe problem asks how many more boys need to enroll for the ratio of boys to girls to be 1:1. That means we want the number of boys to be equal to the number of girls.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of additional boys needed as x.\n\nSo, after enrolling x more boys, the number of boys will be 320 + x.\n\nWe want this to be equal to the number of girls, which is 480.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n320 + x = 480\n\nNow, I'll solve for x.\n\nx = 480 - 320 = 160\n\nSo, 160 more boys need to enroll for the ratio of boys to girls to be 1:1.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf we have 320 boys and add 160 more, that makes 320 + 160 = 480 boys.\n\nAnd there are already 480 girls, so the ratio would be 480 boys to 480 girls, which is indeed 1:1.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
