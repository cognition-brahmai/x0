        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got a book with 300 pages, and I'm reading it with a specific pattern: on the first day, I read 20 pages, and each day after that, I read 5 more pages than the day before. I need to figure out how many days it will take to finish the whole book.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pattern of how many pages I'm reading each day. On day 1, it's 20 pages. On day 2, I read 5 more than day 1, so that's 20 + 5 = 25 pages. On day 3, again 5 more than day 2, so 25 + 5 = 30 pages, and so on. So, each day, the number of pages I read increases by 5.\n\nThis sounds like an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant difference. In this case, the first term \\(a_1\\) is 20 pages, and the common difference \\(d\\) is 5 pages.\n\nThe formula for the \\(n\\)th term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\]\n\nSo, on day \\(n\\), I read:\n\n\\[a_n = 20 + (n - 1) \\times 5\\]\n\nNow, to find out how many days it takes to finish the book, I need to find the smallest integer \\(n\\) such that the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of this sequence is at least 300 pages.\n\nThe sum \\(s_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n)\\]\n\nI can also use the formula:\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]\\]\n\nEither formula should work. I'll use the first one for now.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n)\\]\n\nBut \\(a_n = 20 + (n - 1) \\times 5\\), so plugging that in:\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times \\left(20 + 20 + (n - 1) \\times 5\\right)\\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times \\left(40 + 5(n - 1)\\right)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times \\left(40 + 5n - 5\\right)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times \\left(35 + 5n\\right)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times 5(n + 7)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{5n}{2} \\times (n + 7)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{5n(n + 7)}{2}\\]\n\nI need \\(s_n \\geq 300\\), so:\n\n\\[\\frac{5n(n + 7)}{2} \\geq 300\\]\n\nTo make it easier, I can multiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\[5n(n + 7) \\geq 600\\]\n\nThen divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[n(n + 7) \\geq 120\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(n\\) in the inequality \\(n(n + 7) \\geq 120\\). First, let's solve the equation \\(n(n + 7) = 120\\) to find the critical points.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[n^2 + 7n - 120 = 0\\]\n\nI can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 7\\), and \\(c = -120\\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-120)}}{2 \\times 1}\\]\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 480}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{529}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-7 \\pm 23}{2}\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-7 + 23}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\\]\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-7 - 23}{2} = \\frac{-30}{2} = -15\\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) represents the number of days, it can't be negative, so \\(n = 8\\) is the relevant solution.\n\nNow, I need to check if \\(n = 8\\) days are enough to finish the book, or if it takes more days.\n\nLet's calculate \\(s_8\\):\n\n\\[s_8 = \\frac{5 \\times 8(8 + 7)}{2} = \\frac{40 \\times 15}{2} = \\frac{600}{2} = 300\\]\n\nSo, on day 8, I would have read exactly 300 pages. That means I finish the book on day 8.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure there isn't a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the sum formula again:\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (40 + 5(n - 1))\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (40 + 5n - 5)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (35 + 5n)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times 5(n + 7)\\]\n\n\\[s_n = \\frac{5n(n + 7)}{2}\\]\n\nSetting this equal to 300:\n\n\\[\\frac{5n(n + 7)}{2} = 300\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\[5n(n + 7) = 600\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[n(n + 7) = 120\\]\n\nSo, \\(n^2 + 7n - 120 = 0\\), which gives \\(n = 8\\) as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the sum day by day until I reach or exceed 300 pages.\n\nDay 1: 20 pages, total: 20\n\nDay 2: 25 pages, total: 20 + 25 = 45\n\nDay 3: 30 pages, total: 45 + 30 = 75\n\nDay 4: 35 pages, total: 75 + 35 = 110\n\nDay 5: 40 pages, total: 110 + 40 = 150\n\nDay 6: 45 pages, total: 150 + 45 = 195\n\nDay 7: 50 pages, total: 195 + 50 = 245\n\nDay 8: 55 pages, total: 245 + 55 = 300\n\nYes, on day 8, the total reaches exactly 300 pages.\n\nTherefore, it takes 8 days to finish the book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]\n"
