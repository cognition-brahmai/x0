        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple calculator in Python that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. And it should use functions for each operation, and also handle errors like trying to divide by zero. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to define four functions: one for addition, one for subtraction, one for multiplication, and one for division. Each function should take two numbers as input and return the result of the respective operation.\n\nLet's start with addition. That should be straightforward. I'll define a function called add that takes two parameters, say num1 and num2, and returns num1 plus num2.\n\nSimilarly, for subtraction, I'll have a function called subtract that returns num1 minus num2.\n\nFor multiplication, a function called multiply that returns num1 times num2.\n\nAnd for division, a function called divide that returns num1 divided by num2.\n\nBut I have to be careful with division because dividing by zero isn't allowed. So, I need to handle that exception. In Python, division by zero raises a ZeroDivisionError. So, I should probably put the division operation inside a try-except block to catch that error and handle it gracefully.\n\nAlso, I should think about the user interface. How will the user interact with this calculator? Probably, the user should be able to choose which operation to perform and input the two numbers.\n\nMaybe I can display a menu with options like:\n\n1. Add\n\n2. Subtract\n\n3. Multiply\n\n4. Divide\n\n5. Exit\n\nThen, the user can enter a choice, say 1 for addition, and then enter two numbers. The program should then call the appropriate function and display the result.\n\nI should also make sure that the user inputs are valid numbers. If the user enters something that's not a number, I should handle that error as well.\n\nIn Python, I can use the try-except block to catch ValueError exceptions when converting user input to numbers.\n\nSo, the main part of the program could be a loop that displays the menu, takes the user's choice, takes the two numbers, calls the appropriate function, and displays the result. The loop should continue until the user chooses to exit.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the program in my mind.\n\nFirst, define the four functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide.\n\nThen, in the main part:\n\n- Display menu\n\n- Read user's choice\n\n- If choice is 1 to 4, proceed to ask for two numbers\n\n- Call the corresponding function\n\n- Display the result\n\n- If choice is 5, exit the program\n\n- If choice is invalid, display an error message and ask again\n\nAlso, need to handle exceptions for invalid numbers and division by zero.\n\nLet me think about the divide function in more detail. Since division by zero is a possibility, I'll put the division operation inside a try block, and if a ZeroDivisionError occurs, I'll catch it and display an error message.\n\nAlso, for reading user inputs, I'll use the input() function, which returns a string, so I need to convert it to float or int, depending on whether I want to handle decimal numbers or not. For a simple calculator, I'll assume decimal numbers are allowed, so I'll use float.\n\nBut I need to handle the case where the user enters something that can't be converted to a float, like 'abc'. In that case, Python will raise a ValueError, so I'll put the conversion inside a try-except block to catch ValueError and display an appropriate error message.\n\nOkay, I think I have a plan. Let me start writing some pseudocode to organize my thoughts.\n\nDefine add(num1, num2):\n\nreturn num1 + num2\n\nDefine subtract(num1, num2):\n\nreturn num1 - num2\n\nDefine multiply(num1, num2):\n\nreturn num1 * num2\n\nDefine divide(num1, num2):\n\ntry:\n\nreturn num1 / num2\n\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n\nprint(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n\nreturn None\n\nIn the main function:\n\nwhile True:\n\nDisplay menu:\n\nprint(\"Select operation:\n\n1. Add\n\n2. Subtract\n\n3. Multiply\n\n4. Divide\n\n5. Exit\")\n\ntry:\n\nchoice = int(input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): \"))\n\nif choice == 5:\n\nprint(\"Exiting the calculator.\")\n\nbreak\n\nelif choice in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n\ntry:\n\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\ncontinue\n\nif choice == 1:\n\nprint(\"Result:\", add(num1, num2))\n\nelif choice == 2:\n\nprint(\"Result:\", subtract(num1, num2))\n\nelif choice == 3:\n\nprint(\"Result:\", multiply(num1, num2))\n\nelif choice == 4:\n\nresult = divide(num1, num2)\n\nif result is not None:\n\nprint(\"Result:\", result)\n\nelse:\n\ncontinue\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.\")\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid choice.\")\n\nAlright, that seems like a solid structure. Now, I need to write the actual Python code based on this pseudocode.\n\nI should also think about formatting the output, maybe to a certain number of decimal places, to make it look neat. For example, if the result is a floating-point number, I might want to display it with two decimal places.\n\nIn Python, I can use string formatting to achieve that. For example, print(\"Result: {:.2f}\".format(result))\n\nAlso, I should consider what happens if the user enters a negative number or zero. For addition, subtraction, and multiplication, there are no issues. For division, zero as the denominator should be handled, which I already have in the divide function.\n\nLet me also think about reusability. Although this is a simple program, it's good to have functions for each operation, as per the requirement. This makes the code organized and easier to maintain or extend in the future.\n\nIf I wanted to add more operations later, like exponentiation or modulo, I could just define new functions and add them to the menu.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the program should keep running until the user decides to exit. So, the main loop should continue to prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.\n\nI should also make sure that after each operation, the program doesn't exit unless the user chooses to do so.\n\nLet me think about error messages. For invalid choices, I'll display \"Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.\" For invalid numbers, \"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\" And for division by zero, \"Error: Division by zero.\"\n\nI should make sure that these messages are clear and helpful to the user, guiding them on what to do next.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the program doesn't crash due to unhandled exceptions. That's why I'm using try-except blocks to catch potential errors.\n\nLet me consider some test cases to verify that my program works correctly.\n\nTest case 1:\n\n- Choice: 1 (Add)\n\n- Numbers: 5, 3\n\n- Expected result: 8\n\nTest case 2:\n\n- Choice: 4 (Divide)\n\n- Numbers: 10, 0\n\n- Expected output: Error: Division by zero\n\nTest case 3:\n\n- Choice: 3 (Multiply)\n\n- Numbers: 2.5, 4\n\n- Expected result: 10.0\n\nTest case 4:\n\n- Choice: 2 (Subtract)\n\n- Numbers: -5, 3\n\n- Expected result: -8\n\nTest case 5:\n\n- Choice: 5 (Exit)\n\n- Expected output: Exiting the calculator.\n\nAnd edge cases like:\n\n- Invalid choice: 'abc'\n\n- Invalid number input: 'xyz'\n\n- Division by zero\n\nI need to make sure that the program handles all these cases gracefully without crashing.\n\nOkay, I think I've covered all the necessary aspects. Now, I'll proceed to write the actual Python code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple calculator in Python that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, we'll define separate functions for each operation and handle potential exceptions like dividing by zero.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Define Functions for Each Operation:**\n   - `add(num1, num2)`: Returns the sum of `num1` and `num2`.\n   - `subtract(num1, num2)`: Returns the difference of `num1` and `num2`.\n   - `multiply(num1, num2)`: Returns the product of `num1` and `num2`.\n   - `divide(num1, num2)`: Returns the quotient of `num1` divided by `num2`, handling division by zero.\n\n2. **User Interface:**\n   - Display a menu allowing the user to choose an operation or exit.\n   - Based on the user's choice, prompt for two numbers and display the result of the selected operation.\n\n3. **Exception Handling:**\n   - Handle `ZeroDivisionError` when dividing.\n   - Handle `ValueError` if the user enters invalid numbers or choices.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef add(num1, num2):\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef subtract(num1, num2):\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    return num1 * num2\n\ndef divide(num1, num2):\n    try:\n        return num1 / num2\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        print(\"Select operation:\")\n        print(\"1. Add\")\n        print(\"2. Subtract\")\n        print(\"3. Multiply\")\n        print(\"4. Divide\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n        \n        try:\n            choice = int(input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): \"))\n            if choice == 5:\n                print(\"Exiting the calculator.\")\n                break\n            elif choice in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n                try:\n                    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n                    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n                except ValueError:\n                    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n                    continue\n                if choice == 1:\n                    print(\"Result: {:.2f}\".format(add(num1, num2)))\n                elif choice == 2:\n                    print(\"Result: {:.2f}\".format(subtract(num1, num2)))\n                elif choice == 3:\n                    print(\"Result: {:.2f}\".format(multiply(num1, num2)))\n                elif choice == 4:\n                    result = divide(num1, num2)\n                    if result is not None:\n                        print(\"Result: {:.2f}\".format(result))\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid choice.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Functions:** Each operation is encapsulated in its own function for clarity and reusability.\n- **User Interaction:** A menu-driven interface allows the user to select operations or exit the program.\n- **Exception Handling:** The program handles errors gracefully, providing useful messages for invalid inputs and preventing crashes.\n- **Looping:** The main loop continues to run until the user chooses to exit, allowing multiple calculations in a single session."
