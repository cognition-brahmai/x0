        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 20 meters long and 15 meters wide, and I need to figure out how much fencing is required to go around it. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst things first, I know that a rectangle has four sides, right? Two sides are length and two sides are width. So, if the length is 20 meters and the width is 15 meters, then the total fencing needed should be the sum of all four sides.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I draw a rectangle, one side is 20 meters, and the adjacent side is 15 meters. So, opposite sides are equal in a rectangle. That means there are two sides that are 20 meters each and two sides that are 15 meters each.\n\nTo find the total fencing needed, I think I need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, the formula for perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (20 meters + 15 meters) = 2 * (35 meters) = 70 meters\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. If I add up all four sides: 20 + 15 + 20 + 15, that's 70 meters too. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps using the area or something, but no, fencing is about the perimeter, not the area. Area would be useful if I needed to know how much grass to put inside or something, but here it's about the boundary.\n\nAlternatively, if the garden wasn't rectangular, but say, circular or something, it would be different, but it's specifically a rectangle, so the formula should work.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors to consider. Is the garden on a slope or something? Does the fencing need to account for any gates or openings? The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it's a complete enclosure.\n\nAlso, are there any trees or obstacles that might require more fencing? Again, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll stick with the perimeter calculation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I need 70 meters of fencing to go around the garden.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
