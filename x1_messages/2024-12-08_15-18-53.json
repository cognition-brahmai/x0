        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B each day. Product A takes 2 hours to produce, and product B takes 3 hours. I need to find out the total hours spent producing both products in one day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total hours spent on product A. Since each unit of product A takes 2 hours to produce, and they make 500 units, I can multiply 500 by 2. That should give me the total hours for product A.\n\nSo, 500 units * 2 hours/unit = 1000 hours.\n\nNext, for product B, each unit takes 3 hours to produce, and they make 300 units. So, 300 units * 3 hours/unit = 900 hours.\n\nNow, to find the total hours spent on both products, I just need to add the hours for product A and product B together.\n\n1000 hours + 900 hours = 1900 hours.\n\nTherefore, the factory spends 1900 hours producing both products in one day.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check. The problem says \"how many total hours does the factory spend producing both products in one day?\" and I've calculated the total hours by adding the hours for each product based on their production times and quantities.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap in production or if the factory works in shifts, but the problem doesn't mention any of that. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is 1900 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1900} \\]"
