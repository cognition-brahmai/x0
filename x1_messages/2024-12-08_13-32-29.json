        "content": "Let's see. So, the car can travel 400 miles on a full tank, and the fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon. We need to find out how many gallons it would need for a round trip of 1800 miles.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many miles are in the round trip. A round trip means going to the destination and coming back, so it's twice the one-way distance. But in this case, it's already given as 1800 miles, so I guess that's the total distance for the round trip.\n\nNow, if the car has a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon, that means for every gallon of gas, it can travel 25 miles.\n\nTo find out how many gallons are needed for 1800 miles, I can divide the total miles by the miles per gallon.\n\nSo, gallons needed = total miles / miles per gallon\n\nGallons needed = 1800 miles / 25 miles per gallon\n\nLet me do the math: 1800 divided by 25.\n\n25 times 72 is 1800, so it's 72 gallons.\n\nWait, but the car can travel 400 miles on a full tank. Let me see if that information is relevant here.\n\nIf the car can travel 400 miles on a full tank and the fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, I can check how many gallons are in a full tank.\n\nGallons in a full tank = 400 miles / 25 miles per gallon = 16 gallons.\n\nSo, the car has a 16-gallon tank.\n\nNow, for a 1800-mile trip, it needs 72 gallons.\n\nBut since the tank holds 16 gallons, it would need to refuel several times.\n\nTo find out how many times it needs to refuel, I can divide the total gallons needed by the capacity of the tank.\n\nNumber of refills = total gallons needed / gallons per tank\n\nNumber of refills = 72 / 16 = 4.5\n\nSince you can't refuel half a time, it would need to refuel 5 times, assuming it refills the tank completely each time.\n\nBut the question is probably just asking for the total gallons needed, not the number of refills.\n\nSo, the car needs 72 gallons for the 1800-mile round trip.\n\nWait a minute, but the car can only hold 16 gallons at a time. So, it can't just use 72 gallons without refueling.\n\nActually, the calculation of 72 gallons is correct for the total consumption, but in practice, the car would need to be refueled multiple times.\n\nBut perhaps the question is only asking for the total amount of gas needed, regardless of the tank size.\n\nIn that case, the answer is 72 gallons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's trying to ask how many times you need to fill up the tank for the trip.\n\nLet me see.\n\nTotal gas needed: 1800 miles / 25 mpg = 72 gallons.\n\nTank capacity: 400 miles / 25 mpg = 16 gallons.\n\nNumber of fill-ups: 72 / 16 = 4.5.\n\nSince you can't fill up half a time, you would need to fill up 5 times.\n\nBut perhaps the question is just asking for the total gallons needed, which is 72 gallons.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n72 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
