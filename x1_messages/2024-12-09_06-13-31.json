        "content": "So, let's break this down. The car is traveling in two different phases with different speeds and times. First, it goes at 50 miles per hour for 6 hours, and then it speeds up to 60 miles per hour for another 4 hours. We need to find out the total distance it travels.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part:\n\nDistance 1 = Speed 1 \u00d7 Time 1\n\nThat would be:\n\nDistance 1 = 50 mph \u00d7 6 hours = 300 miles\n\nThen, for the second part:\n\nDistance 2 = Speed 2 \u00d7 Time 2\n\nWhich is:\n\nDistance 2 = 60 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2 = 300 miles + 240 miles = 540 miles\n\nSo, the car travels a total of 540 miles.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If the car is traveling at different speeds for different durations, the total distance should indeed be the sum of the distances traveled in each phase, assuming it's moving in a straight line without any changes in direction.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the average speed for the entire journey, I could do that, but the question is only asking for the total distance, not the average speed or the total time, which I already have.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire journey as two segments and calculate each segment's distance separately, then sum them up. That's what I did initially, and it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total distance, like acceleration or stopping time, but the problem doesn't mention any such things. It says it travels at a average speed of 50 mph for 6 hours, then increases to 60 mph for another 4 hours. So, I think it's safe to assume that those are the only speeds and times involved.\n\nTherefore, the total distance is indeed 540 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{540} \\]"
