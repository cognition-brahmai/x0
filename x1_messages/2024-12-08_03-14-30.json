        "content": "So in this class, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 18 prefer chocolate ice cream. That means the rest prefer vanilla, right? So, to find out how many prefer vanilla, I can subtract the number who prefer chocolate from the total number of students.\n\nSo, 30 minus 18 equals 12. So, 12 students prefer vanilla.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the ratio of students who prefer chocolate to those who prefer vanilla. A ratio compares two quantities, so in this case, it's chocolate preferers to vanilla preferers.\n\nSo, the ratio would be 18 to 12. But ratios can be simplified, just like fractions. Both 18 and 12 can be divided by 6.\n\n18 divided by 6 is 3, and 12 divided by 6 is 2. So, the simplified ratio is 3 to 2.\n\nAlternatively, ratios can be expressed using a colon, so it would be 3:2.\n\nAlternatively, ratios can also be expressed as fractions, so 3/2, but in this context, it's probably more appropriate to use the colon notation.\n\nSo, the ratio of students who prefer chocolate to those who prefer vanilla is 3:2.\n\nTo double-check, I can see if 3:2 makes sense with the original numbers. If for every 3 students who prefer chocolate, there are 2 who prefer vanilla, then the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nIf I divide the total number of students, 30, by 5, I get 6. So, each part represents 6 students.\n\nThen, 3 parts (for chocolate) would be 3 times 6, which is 18, and 2 parts (for vanilla) would be 2 times 6, which is 12. That matches the original numbers.\n\nSo, the ratio is definitely 3:2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:2} \\]"
