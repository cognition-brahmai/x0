        "content": "Alright, I'll try to help you with that. So, you need a simple Java program for a library management system, right? It should have classes for 'Book' and 'Member'. Each book has a title, author, and ISBN number. Each member has a name, membership ID, and a list of borrowed books. Also, you need methods to issue and return books. Got it.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to structure these classes. Let's start with the 'Book' class. It seems straightforward. It should have private fields for title, author, and ISBN number, and public getter and setter methods for these fields.\n\nSimilarly, the 'Member' class should have private fields for name, membership ID, and a list of borrowed books. Since a member can borrow multiple books, the list of borrowed books should probably be an ArrayList of Book objects.\n\nNow, for issuing and returning books, I think these methods should be in the 'Member' class. So, there should be an 'issueBook' method that takes a Book object as a parameter and adds it to the member's list of borrowed books. And a 'returnBook' method that takes a Book object as a parameter and removes it from the member's list of borrowed books.\n\nWait a minute, but in a real library system, the library itself would have a collection of books, and members can borrow books from this collection. So, maybe there should be a 'Library' class that has a list of all available books and a list of all members. Then, the methods for issuing and returning books could be in the 'Library' class, where issuing a book would involve removing it from the library's available books and adding it to the member's borrowed books, and returning a book would be the opposite.\n\nThat sounds more comprehensive. So, let's consider having a 'Library' class that manages both books and members.\n\nLet me sketch out the classes:\n\n1. Book class:\n\n- private String title;\n\n- private String author;\n\n- private String ISBN;\n\n- getters and setters for these fields.\n\n2. Member class:\n\n- private String name;\n\n- private String membershipID;\n\n- private List<Book> borrowedBooks;\n\n- getters and setters for name and membershipID;\n\n- methods to add and remove books from borrowedBooks list.\n\n3. Library class:\n\n- private List<Book> availableBooks;\n\n- private List<Member> members;\n\n- methods to add books and members to the library;\n\n- issueBook method that takes a Member and a Book, removes the book from availableBooks, and adds it to the member's borrowedBooks;\n\n- returnBook method that takes a Member and a Book, removes the book from the member's borrowedBooks, and adds it back to availableBooks.\n\nAlso, to make it simple, maybe we can assume that all books are unique, identified by their ISBN numbers. So, no two books will have the same ISBN.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the issueBook and returnBook methods in the Library class.\n\nFor issueBook:\n\n- Check if the book is available in availableBooks.\n\n- If it is available, remove it from availableBooks and add it to the member's borrowedBooks list.\n\n- If it's not available, perhaps throw an exception or return an error message indicating that the book is not available.\n\nFor returnBook:\n\n- Check if the book is in the member's borrowedBooks list.\n\n- If it is, remove it from borrowedBooks and add it back to availableBooks.\n\n- If it's not in the borrowedBooks list, throw an exception or return an error message indicating that the member didn't borrow this book.\n\nAlso, to make things easier, maybe we can use ISBN numbers to identify books when issuing and returning.\n\nWait, instead of passing Book objects to issueBook and returnBook methods, maybe it's better to pass the ISBN number as a parameter. That way, we can look up the book by its ISBN.\n\nThat might be more efficient and avoids having to pass around Book objects.\n\nSo, perhaps issueBook should take a Member object and a String ISBN, and returnBook should take a Member object and a String ISBN.\n\nIn that case, in the Library class, we need a way to find a book by its ISBN.\n\nSimilarly, in the Member class, the borrowedBooks list would be searched by ISBN to remove a returned book.\n\nLet me adjust the class designs accordingly.\n\nUpdated plans:\n\nBook class remains the same.\n\nMember class:\n\n- private String name;\n\n- private String membershipID;\n\n- private List<Book> borrowedBooks;\n\n- getters and setters for name and membershipID;\n\n- method to add a book to borrowedBooks;\n\n- method to remove a book from borrowedBooks by ISBN.\n\nLibrary class:\n\n- private List<Book> availableBooks;\n\n- private List<Member> members;\n\n- method to add a book to availableBooks;\n\n- method to add a member to members;\n\n- issueBook method that takes a Member and a String ISBN, finds the book in availableBooks by ISBN, removes it from availableBooks, and adds it to the member's borrowedBooks.\n\n- returnBook method that takes a Member and a String ISBN, finds the book in the member's borrowedBooks by ISBN, removes it from borrowedBooks, and adds it back to availableBooks.\n\nAlso, maybe we should keep track of whether a book is available or not, so perhaps having a boolean field in the Book class called 'isAvailable', and set it to true or false accordingly.\n\nBut, since we have separate lists for availableBooks and borrowedBooks, maybe that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but in the Library class, availableBooks list contains books that are not borrowed, and each member has their own list of borrowedBooks. So, perhaps the 'isAvailable' field is redundant.\n\nLet's keep it without the 'isAvailable' field.\n\nNow, for the implementation details:\n\n- In Java, we can use ArrayList for the lists of books and members.\n\n- For the issueBook method, we need to find the book in availableBooks whose ISBN matches the provided ISBN, remove it from availableBooks, and add it to the member's borrowedBooks list.\n\n- Similarly, for returnBook, find the book in the member's borrowedBooks list by ISBN, remove it from there, and add it back to availableBooks.\n\n- We should also handle cases where the book is not found in availableBooks or not found in the member's borrowedBooks list.\n\nLet's think about error handling.\n\n- If someone tries to issue a book that's not available, we should inform them that the book is not available.\n\n- If someone tries to return a book that they didn't borrow, we should inform them that they don't have that book.\n\n- Also, maybe check if the member exists in the library's members list before issuing or returning a book.\n\nLet me consider adding some validation in the methods.\n\nAlso, perhaps we can add some constructors to the classes to initialize the fields.\n\nFor example, in the Book class:\n\npublic Book(String title, String author, String ISBN) {\n\nthis.title = title;\n\nthis.author = author;\n\nthis.ISBN = ISBN;\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, in the Member class:\n\npublic Member(String name, String membershipID) {\n\nthis.name = name;\n\nthis.membershipID = membershipID;\n\nthis.borrowedBooks = new ArrayList<>();\n\n}\n\nAnd in the Library class:\n\npublic Library() {\n\nthis.availableBooks = new ArrayList<>();\n\nthis.members = new ArrayList<>();\n\n}\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the issueBook method in the Library class.\n\nSomething like:\n\npublic void issueBook(Member member, String ISBN) {\n\n// Find the book in availableBooks by ISBN\n\nfor (Book book : availableBooks) {\n\nif (book.getISBN().equals(ISBN)) {\n\n// Found the book, remove it from availableBooks and add to member's borrowedBooks\n\navailableBooks.remove(book);\n\nmember.addBorrowedBook(book);\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n// If loop completes without finding the book, it's not available\n\nthrow new RuntimeException(\"Book with ISBN \" + ISBN + \" is not available.\");\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, for returnBook:\n\npublic void returnBook(Member member, String ISBN) {\n\n// Find the book in member's borrowedBooks by ISBN\n\nfor (Book book : member.getBorrowedBooks()) {\n\nif (book.getISBN().equals(ISBN)) {\n\n// Found the book, remove it from borrowedBooks and add back to availableBooks\n\nmember.removeBorrowedBook(book);\n\navailableBooks.add(book);\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n// If loop completes without finding the book, member didn't borrow it\n\nthrow new RuntimeException(\"Member didn't borrow book with ISBN \" + ISBN);\n\n}\n\nAlso, in the Member class, add methods to add and remove borrowed books:\n\npublic void addBorrowedBook(Book book) {\n\nborrowedBooks.add(book);\n\n}\n\npublic void removeBorrowedBook(Book book) {\n\nborrowedBooks.remove(book);\n\n}\n\nAdditionally, perhaps have a method in Member class to get the list of borrowed books:\n\npublic List<Book> getBorrowedBooks() {\n\nreturn borrowedBooks;\n\n}\n\nNow, to test this system, we can write a simple main method in the Library class or in a separate class.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nLibrary library = new Library();\n\n// Add some books\n\nlibrary.addBook(new Book(\"Book1\", \"Author1\", \"ISBN1\"));\n\nlibrary.addBook(new Book(\"Book2\", \"Author2\", \"ISBN2\"));\n\n// Add some members\n\nMember member1 = new Member(\"Member1\", \"ID1\");\n\nlibrary.addMember(member1);\n\n// Issue a book\n\nlibrary.issueBook(member1, \"ISBN1\");\n\n// Return a book\n\nlibrary.returnBook(member1, \"ISBN1\");\n\n}\n\nThis is a basic implementation. We can expand it by adding more features, like tracking due dates for borrowed books, handling multiple copies of the same book, etc.\n\nBut for a simple library management system, this should suffice.\n\nLet me summarize the classes and their methods:\n\n1. Book class:\n\n- private String title;\n\n- private String author;\n\n- private String ISBN;\n\n- public Book(String title, String author, String ISBN);\n\n- public String getTitle();\n\n- public void setTitle(String title);\n\n- public String getAuthor();\n\n- public void setAuthor(String author);\n\n- public String getISBN();\n\n- public void setISBN(String ISBN);\n\n2. Member class:\n\n- private String name;\n\n- private String membershipID;\n\n- private List<Book> borrowedBooks;\n\n- public Member(String name, String membershipID);\n\n- public String getName();\n\n- public void setName(String name);\n\n- public String getMembershipID();\n\n- public void setMembershipID(String membershipID);\n\n- public List<Book> getBorrowedBooks();\n\n- public void addBorrowedBook(Book book);\n\n- public void removeBorrowedBook(Book book);\n\n3. Library class:\n\n- private List<Book> availableBooks;\n\n- private List<Member> members;\n\n- public Library();\n\n- public void addBook(Book book);\n\n- public void addMember(Member member);\n\n- public void issueBook(Member member, String ISBN) throws RuntimeException;\n\n- public void returnBook(Member member, String ISBN) throws RuntimeException;\n\nAnd a main method to test the system.\n\nI think this covers the requirements. If you have any specific features in mind or need further enhancements, let me know.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo implement a simple library management system in Java, we need to create classes for `Book`, `Member`, and `Library`. The `Book` class will store details about the book, the `Member` class will manage member information and their borrowed books, and the `Library` class will handle the overall operations like issuing and returning books.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Book Class**:\n   - Contains fields for `title`, `author`, and `ISBN`.\n   - Provides getters and setters for these fields.\n\n2. **Member Class**:\n   - Contains fields for `name`, `membershipID`, and a list of `borrowedBooks`.\n   - Provides methods to add and remove books from the `borrowedBooks` list.\n\n3. **Library Class**:\n   - Manages lists of available books and members.\n   - Provides methods to add books and members.\n   - Implements `issueBook` and `returnBook` methods to handle book transactions.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nclass Book {\n    private String title;\n    private String author;\n    private String ISBN;\n\n    public Book(String title, String author, String ISBN) {\n        this.title = title;\n        this.author = author;\n        this.ISBN = ISBN;\n    }\n\n    public String getTitle() {\n        return title;\n    }\n\n    public void setTitle(String title) {\n        this.title = title;\n    }\n\n    public String getAuthor() {\n        return author;\n    }\n\n    public void setAuthor(String author) {\n        this.author = author;\n    }\n\n    public String getISBN() {\n        return ISBN;\n    }\n\n    public void setISBN(String ISBN) {\n        this.ISBN = ISBN;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Member {\n    private String name;\n    private String membershipID;\n    private List<Book> borrowedBooks;\n\n    public Member(String name, String membershipID) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.membershipID = membershipID;\n        this.borrowedBooks = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public String getMembershipID() {\n        return membershipID;\n    }\n\n    public void setMembershipID(String membershipID) {\n        this.membershipID = membershipID;\n    }\n\n    public List<Book> getBorrowedBooks() {\n        return borrowedBooks;\n    }\n\n    public void addBorrowedBook(Book book) {\n        borrowedBooks.add(book);\n    }\n\n    public void removeBorrowedBook(Book book) {\n        borrowedBooks.remove(book);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Library {\n    private List<Book> availableBooks;\n    private List<Member> members;\n\n    public Library() {\n        this.availableBooks = new ArrayList<>();\n        this.members = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addBook(Book book) {\n        availableBooks.add(book);\n    }\n\n    public void addMember(Member member) {\n        members.add(member);\n    }\n\n    public void issueBook(Member member, String ISBN) {\n        for (Book book : availableBooks) {\n            if (book.getISBN().equals(ISBN)) {\n                availableBooks.remove(book);\n                member.addBorrowedBook(book);\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Book with ISBN \" + ISBN + \" is not available.\");\n    }\n\n    public void returnBook(Member member, String ISBN) {\n        for (Book book : member.getBorrowedBooks()) {\n            if (book.getISBN().equals(ISBN)) {\n                member.removeBorrowedBook(book);\n                availableBooks.add(book);\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Member didn't borrow book with ISBN \" + ISBN);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Library library = new Library();\n\n        // Adding some books\n        library.addBook(new Book(\"Book1\", \"Author1\", \"ISBN1\"));\n        library.addBook(new Book(\"Book2\", \"Author2\", \"ISBN2\"));\n\n        // Adding some members\n        Member member1 = new Member(\"Member1\", \"ID1\");\n        library.addMember(member1);\n\n        // Issuing a book\n        library.issueBook(member1, \"ISBN1\");\n\n        // Returning a book\n        library.returnBook(member1, \"ISBN1\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Book Class**:\n   - Initializes with title, author, and ISBN.\n   - Provides methods to get and set these properties.\n\n2. **Member Class**:\n   - Initializes with name and membershipID, and maintains a list of borrowed books.\n   - Methods to add and remove books from the borrowed list.\n\n3. **Library Class**:\n   - Manages collections of available books and members.\n   - Methods to add new books and members.\n   - `issueBook` method to handle book issuance by removing from available books and adding to member's borrowed list.\n   - `returnBook` method to handle book return by removing from member's borrowed list and adding back to available books.\n   - A simple `main` method to demonstrate the functionality."
