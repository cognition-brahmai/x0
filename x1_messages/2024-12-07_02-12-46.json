        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a box with 10 white balls, 20 black balls, and 30 green balls. I need to figure out the minimum number of balls I must draw without replacement to guarantee that I get at least one ball of each color. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to guarantee getting at least one of each color. It means that no matter how unlucky I am with the draws, I will still end up with at least one white, one black, and one green ball.\n\nLet's think about the worst-case scenario. The worst that could happen is that I keep drawing balls of the same color or two colors until finally, I am forced to draw the third color.\n\nSo, what's the maximum number of balls I could draw without getting all three colors? If I draw all the balls of two colors first, then the next ball I draw will have to be of the third color.\n\nLet's see: there are 10 white, 20 black, and 30 green balls.\n\nIf I draw all the green balls first, that's 30 balls, and then all the black balls, that's another 20, totaling 50 balls without getting a white ball. But I need to guarantee getting at least one of each color.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the scenario where I haven't gotten all three colors yet.\n\nSo, if I draw all 30 green balls and all 20 black balls, that's 50 balls, and still, I don't have a white ball. The next ball I draw, the 51st ball, must be white because that's all that's left.\n\nSimilarly, if I draw all 30 green balls and all 10 white balls, that's 40 balls, and the next ball, the 41st, must be black.\n\nOr, if I draw all 20 black balls and all 30 green balls, that's 50 balls, and the next ball, the 51st, must be white.\n\nSo, to guarantee getting at least one of each color, I need to consider the scenario where I draw the maximum number of balls without getting all three colors, and then draw one more.\n\nThe maximum number of balls without getting all three colors is drawing all balls of the two most abundant colors. In this case, that's 30 green and 20 black, totaling 50 balls.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of balls I must draw to guarantee getting at least one of each color is 50 + 1 = 51.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this.\n\nSuppose I draw 30 green, 20 black, and then 1 white. That's 51 balls, and I have at least one of each color.\n\nIs there a way to draw fewer than 51 balls and still guarantee having at least one of each color?\n\nLet's say I draw 50 balls. In the worst case, those 50 balls could be all green and black, meaning I haven't drawn any white balls. So, I couldn't guarantee having at least one of each color with 50 balls.\n\nTherefore, 51 is indeed the minimum number of balls I must draw to guarantee having at least one of each color.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total number of balls minus the smallest group. The total number of balls is 10 white + 20 black + 30 green = 60 balls.\n\nIf I draw 60 - 10 = 50 balls, I could still have missed all white balls. So, I need to draw one more to guarantee that I have at least one white ball, making it 51 balls.\n\nWait, but actually, to guarantee having at least one of each color, I need to consider the sum of the two largest groups plus one.\n\nSo, the two largest groups are green (30) and black (20), totaling 50. Drawing 50 balls could mean all green and black, missing white. So, drawing 51 balls ensures that at least one ball is white.\n\nSimilarly, if I consider drawing all but the smallest group, I need to ensure that I can't avoid drawing from the smallest group.\n\nIn this case, the smallest group is white with 10 balls.\n\nSo, drawing 60 - 10 = 50 balls could exclude the white balls, but drawing 51 ensures that at least one white ball is drawn.\n\nAlternatively, if the smallest group was different, I would adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, but in this problem, white has the fewest balls, so drawing 50 could mean all black and green, and drawing 51 guarantees at least one white.\n\nBut, to guarantee at least one of each color, I need to ensure that I have at least one white, one black, and one green.\n\nWait, suppose I draw all 30 green and all 20 black balls first, totaling 50, and then the 51st ball would be white.\n\nAlternatively, if I draw all 30 green and all 10 white balls, that's 40 balls, and the next ball, the 41st, would be black.\n\nOr, drawing all 20 black and all 30 green balls, 50 balls, and the 51st is white.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, I have to draw 51 balls to guarantee having at least one of each color.\n\nBut, is there a better way to think about this?\n\nLet me consider the concept of the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole has more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this context, the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors, and the \"pigeons\" are the balls drawn.\n\nI need to ensure that I have at least one ball in each \"pigeonhole\" (color).\n\nTo apply the pigeonhole principle here, I need to consider the worst-case scenario where I have drawn as many balls as possible without having one of each color.\n\nThat would be drawing all balls of two colors and then drawing one more to ensure the third color.\n\nSo, again, drawing 30 green and 20 black balls, totaling 50, and then drawing one more ensures I get a white ball.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of balls to draw to guarantee having at least one of each color is 51.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think of it in terms of guarantees for each color.\n\nI need to guarantee at least one white, one black, and one green ball.\n\nTo guarantee a white ball, since there are 10 white balls, in the worst case, I could draw all 50 non-white balls first (20 black + 30 green), and the next ball would be white.\n\nSimilarly, to guarantee a black ball, I could draw all 40 balls that are not black (10 white + 30 green), and the next ball would be black.\n\nAnd to guarantee a green ball, I could draw all 30 non-green balls (10 white + 20 black), and the next ball would be green.\n\nBut the question is asking for guaranteeing at least one of each color.\n\nSo, I need to consider the scenario where I have drawn the maximum number of balls possible without having all three colors, and then draw one more.\n\nThat would be drawing all balls of the two most abundant colors, which are green (30) and black (20), totaling 50, and then drawing one more ball, which must be white.\n\nTherefore, 51 balls is the minimum number I need to draw to guarantee having at least one of each color.\n\nBut let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I want to ensure that I have at least one of each color.\n\nI could think about the total number of balls minus the largest group that doesn't include all three colors.\n\nIn this case, the largest group that doesn't include all three colors is the sum of the two largest groups: green (30) and black (20), which is 50.\n\nSo, drawing 50 balls could mean all green and black, missing white.\n\nTherefore, drawing 51 balls ensures that at least one ball is white.\n\nSimilarly, it ensures that I have at least one black and one green ball, because even if I drew all 30 green and 20 black first, the 51st ball would be white.\n\nAlternatively, if I drew all 30 green and some black and white, I still would have at least one of each color by the time I reach 51 balls.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is 51.\n\nWait, but let's think about another scenario.\n\nSuppose I draw balls one by one.\n\nIn the worst case, I draw all 30 green balls first, then all 20 black balls, totaling 50 balls, and still, I don't have a white ball.\n\nBut as soon as I draw the 51st ball, it has to be white because that's all that's left.\n\nTherefore, after drawing 51 balls, I am guaranteed to have at least one white ball, in addition to the black and green balls I've already drawn.\n\nSimilarly, if I draw fewer than 51 balls, say 50 balls, it's possible that I have all green and black balls, missing the white ones.\n\nTherefore, 51 is indeed the minimum number required to guarantee having at least one of each color.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total number of balls is 60 (10 white + 20 black + 30 green).\n\nTo guarantee having at least one of each color, I need to cover the scenario where I miss one color entirely.\n\nThe largest number of balls I can draw without getting one of the smallest group is 50 (30 green + 20 black), excluding white.\n\nTherefore, drawing 51 balls ensures that I have at least one white ball, in addition to the other colors.\n\nSimilarly, if the smallest group was different, I would adjust accordingly.\n\nBut in this case, white has the fewest balls, so 51 is the minimum number needed.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider the sum of the two largest groups plus one.\n\nSo, 30 green + 20 black = 50, plus one more to ensure a green, black, or white.\n\nBut actually, as I thought earlier, drawing 50 could be all green and black, and the 51st ensures white.\n\nAlternatively, if I draw 40 balls, it could be all green and white, missing some black balls, but not guaranteeing all three colors.\n\nWait, no, to guarantee all three colors, I need to ensure that no matter what, I have at least one of each.\n\nSo, the worst-case scenario is drawing all balls of the two most abundant colors first.\n\nIn this case, that's 30 green and 20 black, totaling 50.\n\nThen, the next ball, the 51st, must be white.\n\nTherefore, 51 is the minimum number required.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total number of balls minus the smallest group plus one.\n\nTotal balls are 60, smallest group is 10 white.\n\nSo, 60 - 10 + 1 = 51.\n\nThis formula also gives me the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of balls I must draw to guarantee getting at least one of each color is 51.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{51} \\]"
