        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls are in the class.\n\nThe class has 30 students, and 60% of them are boys. So, to find the number of boys:\n\nNumber of boys = 60% of 30 = (60/100) * 30 = 18 boys\n\nSince the rest are girls, the number of girls is:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 30 - 18 = 12 girls\n\nNow, we're told that half of the boys join the school's sports club. So, the number of boys joining the sports club is:\n\nNumber of boys joining = Half of 18 = 18 / 2 = 9 boys\n\nAdditionally, two-thirds of the girls join the sports club. So, the number of girls joining is:\n\nNumber of girls joining = Two-thirds of 12 = (2/3) * 12 = 8 girls\n\nTo find the total number of students who have joined the sports club, we add the number of boys and girls joining:\n\nTotal students joining = Number of boys joining + Number of girls joining = 9 + 8 = 17 students\n\nSo, 17 students in total have joined the sports club.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
