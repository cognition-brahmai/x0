        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Jane reads 15 pages in 30 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take her to read a 300-page book at the same rate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out her reading speed. If she reads 15 pages in 30 minutes, that means she reads 1 page in how many minutes? Let's see, 30 minutes divided by 15 pages equals 2 minutes per page.\n\nSo, her reading speed is 2 minutes per page.\n\nNow, if the book has 300 pages, and she reads at 2 minutes per page, then the total time would be 300 pages times 2 minutes per page. That would be 600 minutes.\n\nBut wait, 600 minutes seems like a lot. Maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, if she reads 15 pages in 30 minutes, perhaps I can find out how many pages she reads per minute. 15 pages divided by 30 minutes equals 0.5 pages per minute.\n\nThen, to read 300 pages at 0.5 pages per minute, it would take 300 divided by 0.5, which is also 600 minutes.\n\nHmm, same answer. But I feel like it's easier to understand in terms of hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 600 minutes divided by 60 equals 10 hours.\n\nSo, it would take her 10 hours to read the 300-page book.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nSuppose I find out how many 15-page chunks there are in 300 pages. 300 divided by 15 equals 20. So, there are 20 chunks of 15 pages in 300 pages.\n\nSince each 15-page chunk takes 30 minutes, 20 chunks would take 20 times 30 minutes, which is 600 minutes, or 10 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use proportions. If 15 pages take 30 minutes, then 300 pages would take x minutes.\n\nSo, 15/30 = 300/x\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, it should be 15 pages / x minutes = 30 minutes / 300 pages, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me recall the correct way to set up proportions. If A/B = C/D, then A*D = B*C.\n\nIn this case, pages over time should be equal: 15 pages / 30 minutes = 300 pages / x minutes.\n\nSo, 15/30 = 300/x\n\nCross-multiplying: 15*x = 30*300\n\n15x = 9000\n\nx = 9000 / 15\n\nx = 600 minutes.\n\nAgain, 600 minutes is 10 hours.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 10 hours.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there are any breaks or rest periods she might take while reading, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So, I'll assume she reads continuously without breaks.\n\nAlso, perhaps the difficulty of the book could affect reading speed, but again, the problem doesn't provide any information about that. So, I'll stick with the given rate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 10 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
