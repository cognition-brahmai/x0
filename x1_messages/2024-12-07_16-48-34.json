        "content": "Rugby is a sport that was invented in England. The game originated at Rugby School in Warwickshire, England, in 1823 when a young player named William Webb Ellis picked up the ball during a football match and ran with it over the opposition's goal line. This act is often cited as the beginning of rugby football. The sport has since spread globally and is now played in many countries around the world, with international competitions such as the Rugby World Cup."
