We need to find the value of \\( a_6 \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a recursive formula is. A recursive formula defines each term in a sequence based on the preceding term(s). In this case, each term \\( a_n \\) is defined as three times the previous term \\( a_{n-1} \\) minus two.\n\nSince we're given \\( a_1 = 5 \\), we can use the recursive formula to find \\( a_2 \\), then \\( a_3 \\), and so on, up to \\( a_6 \\).\n\nLet's start by finding \\( a_2 \\):\n\n\\( a_2 = 3a_1 - 2 = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 \\)\n\nNow, \\( a_3 \\):\n\n\\( a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 = 3(13) - 2 = 39 - 2 = 37 \\)\n\nNext, \\( a_4 \\):\n\n\\( a_4 = 3a_3 - 2 = 3(37) - 2 = 111 - 2 = 109 \\)\n\nThen, \\( a_5 \\):\n\n\\( a_5 = 3a_4 - 2 = 3(109) - 2 = 327 - 2 = 325 \\)\n\nFinally, \\( a_6 \\):\n\n\\( a_6 = 3a_5 - 2 = 3(325) - 2 = 975 - 2 = 973 \\)\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check those calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n\\( a_1 = 5 \\)\n\n\\( a_2 = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 \\) \u2192 correct\n\n\\( a_3 = 3(13) - 2 = 39 - 2 = 37 \\) \u2192 correct\n\n\\( a_4 = 3(37) - 2 = 111 - 2 = 109 \\) \u2192 correct\n\n\\( a_5 = 3(109) - 2 = 327 - 2 = 325 \\) \u2192 correct\n\n\\( a_6 = 3(325) - 2 = 975 - 2 = 973 \\) \u2192 correct\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But maybe there's a pattern or a closed-form formula that could make this easier for larger n.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for \\( a_n \\).\n\nGiven the recursive formula \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2 \\), I can look for a solution of the form \\( a_n = c \\cdot 3^n + d \\), where c and d are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, let's assume \\( a_n = c \\cdot 3^n + d \\). Plugging this into the recursive formula:\n\n\\( c \\cdot 3^n + d = 3(c \\cdot 3^{n-1} + d) - 2 \\)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\( 3(c \\cdot 3^{n-1}) + 3d - 2 = c \\cdot 3^n + 3d - 2 \\)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\( c \\cdot 3^n + d = c \\cdot 3^n + 3d - 2 \\)\n\nNow, subtract \\( c \\cdot 3^n \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( d = 3d - 2 \\)\n\nSolve for d:\n\n\\( d - 3d = -2 \\)\n\n\\( -2d = -2 \\)\n\n\\( d = 1 \\)\n\nSo, the general solution is \\( a_n = c \\cdot 3^n + 1 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the constant c using the initial condition \\( a_1 = 5 \\):\n\n\\( 5 = c \\cdot 3^1 + 1 \\)\n\n\\( 5 = 3c + 1 \\)\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\( 4 = 3c \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\( c = \\frac{4}{3} \\)\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula for \\( a_n \\) is:\n\n\\( a_n = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot 3^n + 1 \\)\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n\\( a_n = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3^n}{3} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^{n-1} + 1 \\)\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier terms to ensure it's correct.\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\( a_1 = 4 \\cdot 3^{1-1} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^0 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 5 \\) \u2192 correct\n\nFor \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\( a_2 = 4 \\cdot 3^{2-1} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^1 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \\) \u2192 correct\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\( a_3 = 4 \\cdot 3^{3-1} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^2 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 9 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37 \\) \u2192 correct\n\nFor \\( n = 4 \\):\n\n\\( a_4 = 4 \\cdot 3^{4-1} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^3 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 27 + 1 = 108 + 1 = 109 \\) \u2192 correct\n\nFor \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\( a_5 = 4 \\cdot 3^{5-1} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^4 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 81 + 1 = 324 + 1 = 325 \\) \u2192 correct\n\nFor \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\( a_6 = 4 \\cdot 3^{6-1} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^5 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 243 + 1 = 972 + 1 = 973 \\) \u2192 matches our earlier calculation\n\nGreat, so the formula holds up. Now, to find \\( a_6 \\), we can simply plug n = 6 into the formula:\n\n\\( a_6 = 4 \\cdot 3^{6-1} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^5 + 1 = 4 \\cdot 243 + 1 = 972 + 1 = 973 \\)\n\nAlternatively, if we were to continue the recursive calculations:\n\n\\( a_1 = 5 \\)\n\n\\( a_2 = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 \\)\n\n\\( a_3 = 3(13) - 2 = 39 - 2 = 37 \\)\n\n\\( a_4 = 3(37) - 2 = 111 - 2 = 109 \\)\n\n\\( a_5 = 3(109) - 2 = 327 - 2 = 325 \\)\n\n\\( a_6 = 3(325) - 2 = 975 - 2 = 973 \\)\n\nEither way, we arrive at the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another approach to verify this result. Perhaps using the concept of arithmetic or geometric sequences, although this sequence doesn't seem arithmetic or geometric at first glance.\n\nWait a second, the recursive formula is \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2 \\). This looks like a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form \\( a_n - 3a_{n-1} = -2 \\).\n\nTo solve this, we can find the general solution by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\n\\( a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0 \\)\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n\\( r - 3 = 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( r = 3 \\)\n\nSo, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is:\n\n\\( a_n^{(h)} = c \\cdot 3^n \\)\n\nNext, find a particular solution \\( a_n^{(p)} \\) to the nonhomogeneous equation \\( a_n - 3a_{n-1} = -2 \\).\n\nSince the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (-2), we can assume a particular solution that is a constant. Let\u2019s say \\( a_n^{(p)} = k \\), where k is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n\\( k - 3k = -2 \\)\n\n\\( -2k = -2 \\)\n\n\\( k = 1 \\)\n\nTherefore, the particular solution is \\( a_n^{(p)} = 1 \\).\n\nNow, the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is:\n\n\\( a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = c \\cdot 3^n + 1 \\)\n\nThis matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition \\( a_1 = 5 \\):\n\n\\( 5 = c \\cdot 3^1 + 1 \\)\n\n\\( 5 = 3c + 1 \\)\n\n\\( 4 = 3c \\)\n\n\\( c = \\frac{4}{3} \\)\n\nThus, the explicit formula is:\n\n\\( a_n = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot 3^n + 1 = 4 \\cdot 3^{n-1} + 1 \\)\n\nAgain, plugging in n = 6:\n\n\\( a_6 = 4 \\cdot 3^{5} + 1 = 4 \\cdot 243 + 1 = 972 + 1 = 973 \\)\n\nEverything checks out. So, the value of \\( a_6 \\) is 973.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{973} \\]"
