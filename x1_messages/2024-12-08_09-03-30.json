        "content": "So I have this problem here: there are 15 different types of fruits, and I want to buy 5 different types. I need to find out how many different combinations I can choose from. Hmm, combinations, not permutations, because the order in which I pick the fruits doesn't matter, right? It's just about which fruits I end up with, not the sequence I choose them in.\n\nOkay, so the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 15 and k = 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate 15!. That's 15 factorial, which is 15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1. But wait, calculating full factorials can be time-consuming, especially for larger numbers. Is there a better way to compute this without calculating the full factorials?\n\nActually, yes. The formula can be simplified. Since C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), and n! = n \u00d7 (n - 1) \u00d7 (n - 2) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (n - k + 1) \u00d7 (n - k)!), we can cancel out (n - k)! in the numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, C(n, k) = [n \u00d7 (n - 1) \u00d7 (n - 2) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (n - k + 1)] / k!\n\nIn this case, C(15, 5) = [15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11] / 5!\n\nNow, 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nSo, C(15, 5) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11) / 120\n\nLet me calculate the numerator first:\n\n15 \u00d7 14 = 210\n\n210 \u00d7 13 = 2730\n\n2730 \u00d7 12 = 32760\n\n32760 \u00d7 11 = 360360\n\nNow, divide that by 120:\n\n360360 / 120 = 3003\n\nSo, there are 3003 different combinations of 5 fruits that I can choose from 15 different types.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe using Pascal's triangle or some other combinatorial identity?\n\nPascal's triangle shows the values of C(n, k) for different n and k. However, constructing Pascal's triangle up to n = 15 might be tedious. Maybe I can use some properties of combinations to check this.\n\nOne property is that C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). So, C(15, 5) should be equal to C(15, 10). Let me check that.\n\nC(15, 10) = [15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6] / 10!\n\nWait, that seems more complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with C(15, 5).\n\nAlternatively, I can use the multiplication formula for combinations. But I think the way I did it initially is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for the first fruit, I have 15 choices, for the second, 14 choices, and so on, down to the fifth fruit, which has 11 choices. But since the order doesn't matter, I need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 5 fruits, which is 5!.\n\nSo, that's the same as what I did earlier: (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11) / 5! = 3003.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach. Suppose I list out all possible combinations manually. But that's impractical for large n and k, like 15 and 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the combination formula in terms of binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficient C(n, k) represents the number of ways to choose k items from n without regard to order.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I need. So, C(15, 5) = 3003 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can look up a combination calculator online to verify this. But since I'm supposed to solve it without external tools, I'll trust my calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3003 different combinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3003} \\]"
