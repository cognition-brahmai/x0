        "content": "In 1610, Galileo Galilei first observed the planet Jupiter through his telescope and discovered four of its largest moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are now known as the Galilean moons in his honor. Galileo's observations provided strong evidence in support of the heliocentric model of the solar system, which posited that the planets orbit the Sun rather than the Earth. This was a significant departure from the prevailing geocentric model of the time and marked an important milestone in the history of astronomy."
