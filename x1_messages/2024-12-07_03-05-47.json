        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters long and 200 meters wide. He wants to plant crops in rows with 2 meters between each row. The question is, how many rows can he plant?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like the farmer is going to plant rows of crops, and each row will be 2 meters apart from the next one. So, I need to figure out how many such rows can fit into the field.\n\nNow, the field is rectangular, with a length of 300 meters and a width of 200 meters. But the problem doesn't specify along which dimension the rows are being planted. Is he planting the rows along the length or along the width?\n\nHmm, maybe it doesn't matter which direction he plants the rows, but I think I need to assume one direction to proceed. Let's assume that the rows are being planted along the length of the field, which is 300 meters.\n\nSo, if the rows are along the 300-meter length, and each row is 2 meters apart, how many rows can fit into the 200-meter width?\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm confusing the dimensions. If the rows are along the length (300 meters), then the spacing between rows (2 meters) would be along the width (200 meters). So, the number of rows would be determined by how many 2-meter spaces fit into the 200-meter width.\n\nLet me think about that. If the rows are spaced 2 meters apart, and the total width is 200 meters, then the number of rows would be 200 divided by 2, which is 100 rows.\n\nBut wait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything else I need to consider?\n\nMaybe I should consider whether the first row starts at zero, and then each subsequent row is 2 meters apart. So, the distance from the first row to the last row would be (number of rows - 1) times the spacing.\n\nIn other words, if there are n rows, the total space occupied by the rows would be (n - 1) * 2 meters.\n\nThis should be less than or equal to the width of the field, which is 200 meters.\n\nSo, (n - 1) * 2 \u2264 200.\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn - 1 \u2264 100\n\nn \u2264 101\n\nSo, the maximum number of rows is 101.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I thought it was 200 divided by 2, which is 100 rows. But according to this calculation, it's 101 rows.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me visualize this. If there are 101 rows, with 2 meters between each row, then the total spacing between the first and the last row would be (101 - 1) * 2 = 100 * 2 = 200 meters.\n\nThat fits exactly within the 200-meter width.\n\nSo, yes, 101 rows would work.\n\nBut let's check if that makes sense.\n\nImagine the first row at the starting point, and then each subsequent row is 2 meters away.\n\nSo, row 1 at 0 meters\n\nrow 2 at 2 meters\n\nrow 3 at 4 meters\n\n...\n\nrow 100 at 198 meters\n\nrow 101 at 200 meters\n\nSo, the last row is at 200 meters, which is exactly the width of the field.\n\nTherefore, the farmer can plant 101 rows.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if the rows are planted along the other dimension.\n\nWhat if the rows are planted along the width, which is 200 meters, and the spacing is 2 meters along the length, which is 300 meters?\n\nIn that case, the number of rows would be determined by the length divided by the spacing.\n\nSo, 300 meters / 2 meters = 150 rows.\n\nBut in this scenario, the rows are along the width, which might not be what the problem intended.\n\nThe problem says \"plant crops in rows with a spacing of 2 meters between each row.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the direction of the rows, so both possibilities could be valid.\n\nHowever, in agriculture, rows are often planted along the length of the field to maximize the distance for things like irrigation or machinery movement.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst scenario: rows along the length (300 meters), spaced 2 meters apart along the width (200 meters). Number of rows = 101.\n\nSecond scenario: rows along the width (200 meters), spaced 2 meters apart along the length (300 meters). Number of rows = 150.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the direction, perhaps I should consider both options.\n\nBut maybe there's a standard practice in farming that can help decide.\n\nIn general, crop rows are arranged to optimize sunlight exposure, irrigation, and mechanical access. Longer rows are often preferred to minimize turns for planting and harvesting machinery.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that the farmer would plant longer rows along the length of the field, which is 300 meters in this case.\n\nTherefore, the more reasonable assumption is that the rows are along the length, with spacing along the width.\n\nThus, the number of rows would be 101.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps I should check if 150 rows along the width make sense.\n\nIf the rows are along the width (200 meters), and spaced 2 meters apart along the 300-meter length, then yes, that would give 150 rows.\n\nHowever, this would mean that each row is only 200 meters long, which might be less efficient for machinery movement and other farm operations compared to longer rows.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that the farmer would choose to have longer rows along the length of the field.\n\nHence, the number of rows would be 101.\n\nBut to be comprehensive, I should mention both possibilities in my answer.\n\nSo, the farmer can plant either 101 rows along the length or 150 rows along the width, depending on the direction of the rows.\n\nHowever, considering standard farming practices, planting longer rows along the length is more probable.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is 101 rows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{101} \\]"
