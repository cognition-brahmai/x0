        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving from different towns and heading towards each other. Town A and Town B are 420 miles apart. One train leaves Town A going towards Town B at 60 miles per hour, and at the same time, another train leaves Town B going towards Town A at 80 miles per hour. I need to find out how many hours it will take for these two trains to meet.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to visualize the situation. So, imagine Town A and Town B are on a straight line, 420 miles apart. Train 1 starts at Town A, moving towards Town B at 60 mph, and Train 2 starts at Town B, moving towards Town A at 80 mph. They're leaving at the same time and moving towards each other.\n\nNow, the key here is to figure out when their paths will cross, or in other words, when the sum of the distances they've traveled equals the total distance between the towns.\n\nLet me denote the time it takes for them to meet as \"t\" hours. So, in \"t\" hours, Train 1, traveling at 60 mph, will cover a distance of 60t miles. Similarly, Train 2, traveling at 80 mph, will cover a distance of 80t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the total distance they cover together should add up to the entire distance between the towns, which is 420 miles. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n60t + 80t = 420\n\nNow, combining like terms:\n\n140t = 420\n\nThen, solving for \"t\":\n\nt = 420 / 140\n\nt = 3 hours\n\nSo, it should take 3 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the relative speed of the two trains. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speeds add up. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nNow, if they're approaching each other at a combined speed of 140 mph, and the distance between them is 420 miles, then the time it takes for them to meet is the distance divided by their relative speed.\n\nSo, time = distance / relative speed = 420 / 140 = 3 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my first answer. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe considering the proportion of distances each train travels.\n\nFor example, Train 1 is going at 60 mph, and Train 2 at 80 mph. So, the ratio of their speeds is 60:80, which simplifies to 3:4.\n\nThat means that for every hour, Train 1 travels 3 parts of the distance, and Train 2 travels 4 parts, making a total of 7 parts.\n\nWait, but in the context of meeting time, I'm not sure if that's necessary since I already have the straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the time it takes for each train to cover their respective distances, but again, that seems more complicated than the initial method.\n\nI think the first method is sufficient and accurate. The two trains will meet after 3 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any factor I might have missed. For example, is the track straight between the two towns? The problem says \"the distance between the two towns is 420 miles,\" which implies a straight-line distance, and it's reasonable to assume they're moving directly towards each other on a straight track.\n\nAlso, there's no information about stops or changes in speed, so I can assume they're moving at constant speeds.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the units. Both speeds are in miles per hour, and the distance is in miles, so the units are consistent, which is good.\n\nSo, overall, I'm confident that the answer is 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
