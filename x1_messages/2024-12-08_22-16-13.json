        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We've got a city with 20,000 households, and the average annual income for all of them is $50,000. That means if we add up everyone's income and divide by 20,000, we get $50,000.\n\nNow, the top 5% of households earn an average of $200,000 per year. First, I need to figure out how many households are in this top 5%. Five percent of 20,000 is:\n\n0.05 * 20,000 = 1,000 households\n\nSo, there are 1,000 households in the top 5%, each averaging $200,000 per year. The remaining 95% would be:\n\n20,000 - 1,000 = 19,000 households\n\nWe need to find the average annual income for these 19,000 households.\n\nLet's denote the total income of all 20,000 households as T. Since the average is $50,000, we have:\n\nT = 20,000 * 50,000 = $1,000,000,000\n\nNow, the total income of the top 1,000 households is:\n\n1,000 * 200,000 = $200,000,000\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total income of the remaining 19,000 households as T_remaining. Then:\n\nT_remaining = T - (top 1,000 households' total income) = 1,000,000,000 - 200,000,000 = $800,000,000\n\nNow, to find the average income for these 19,000 households, we divide their total income by the number of households:\n\nAverage_remaining = T_remaining / 19,000 = 800,000,000 / 19,000\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n800,000,000 \u00f7 19,000 = 800,000,000 / 19,000\n\nFirst, simplify the denominator:\n\n19,000 = 19 * 1,000\n\nSo,\n\n800,000,000 / 19,000 = (800,000,000 / 19) / 1,000\n\nCalculate 800,000,000 / 19:\n\n800,000,000 \u00f7 19 \u2248 42,105,263.16\n\nNow, divide by 1,000:\n\n42,105,263.16 / 1,000 = 42,105.26316\n\nSo, the average annual income of the remaining 95% of households is approximately $42,105.26.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total income of all households:\n\n20,000 * 50,000 = 1,000,000,000\n\nTotal income of top 1,000 households:\n\n1,000 * 200,000 = 200,000,000\n\nRemaining income:\n\n1,000,000,000 - 200,000,000 = 800,000,000\n\nAverage of remaining 19,000 households:\n\n800,000,000 / 19,000 = 42,105.26316\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can use weighted averages to confirm.\n\nThe overall average is a weighted average of the top 5% and the remaining 95%.\n\nSo:\n\nAverage = (percentage of top * average of top) + (percentage of remaining * average of remaining)\n\nIn decimal form:\n\n5% = 0.05\n\n95% = 0.95\n\nSo:\n\n50,000 = (0.05 * 200,000) + (0.95 * average_remaining)\n\nLet's solve for average_remaining:\n\n50,000 = (0.05 * 200,000) + (0.95 * average_remaining)\n\nFirst, calculate 0.05 * 200,000:\n\n0.05 * 200,000 = 10,000\n\nSo:\n\n50,000 = 10,000 + (0.95 * average_remaining)\n\nSubtract 10,000 from both sides:\n\n50,000 - 10,000 = 0.95 * average_remaining\n\n40,000 = 0.95 * average_remaining\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.95:\n\naverage_remaining = 40,000 / 0.95 = 42,105.26316\n\nSame result as before. So, the average annual income of the remaining 95% of households is approximately $42,105.26.\n\nWait a minute, but in the first method, I got $42,105.26, and in the second method, I got the same. But I think I made a mistake in the first method.\n\nWait, 800,000,000 divided by 19,000 is indeed 42,105.26316, but let's confirm the division.\n\nLet me calculate 800,000,000 \u00f7 19,000 step by step.\n\nFirst, 19,000 goes into 800,000,000 how many times?\n\n19,000 * 42,105 = 19,000 * 42,105\n\nCalculate 19 * 42,105 first:\n\n19 * 42,105 = 799,995\n\nThen, since it's 19,000, we have:\n\n19,000 * 42,105 = 799,995,000\n\nNow, 800,000,000 - 799,995,000 = 5,000\n\nSo, 19,000 goes into 5,000 zero times, with a remainder of 5,000.\n\nTherefore, 800,000,000 \u00f7 19,000 = 42,105 with a remainder of 5,000.\n\nTo express this as a decimal, 5,000 / 19,000 = 0.2631578947368421\n\nSo, overall, 800,000,000 \u00f7 19,000 = 42,105.2631578947368421\n\nRounded to two decimal places, it's $42,105.26.\n\nYes, that matches both methods.\n\nTherefore, the average annual income of the remaining 95% of households is approximately $42,105.26.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's another way to look at this problem or if there are any assumptions I need to consider.\n\nFor example, are there any constraints on the distribution of incomes besides the averages given? The problem doesn't provide any information about the distribution beyond the averages for the overall population and the top 5%.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the approach I took seems valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about it in terms of total income.\n\nTotal income of all households: 20,000 * 50,000 = 1,000,000,000\n\nTotal income of top 1,000 households: 1,000 * 200,000 = 200,000,000\n\nTherefore, total income of remaining 19,000 households: 1,000,000,000 - 200,000,000 = 800,000,000\n\nAverage income of remaining households: 800,000,000 / 19,000 = approximately 42,105.26\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of weighted averages.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- The average income of the top 5%: A1 = 200,000\n\n- The average income of the remaining 95%: A2\n\n- The overall average income: A = 50,000\n\n- The weights: w1 = 5% = 0.05, w2 = 95% = 0.95\n\nThe weighted average formula is:\n\nA = (w1 * A1) + (w2 * A2)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n50,000 = (0.05 * 200,000) + (0.95 * A2)\n\nCalculate 0.05 * 200,000:\n\n0.05 * 200,000 = 10,000\n\nSo:\n\n50,000 = 10,000 + (0.95 * A2)\n\nSubtract 10,000 from both sides:\n\n50,000 - 10,000 = 0.95 * A2\n\n40,000 = 0.95 * A2\n\nNow, solve for A2:\n\nA2 = 40,000 / 0.95 = approximately 42,105.26\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method used, the answer remains consistent.\n\nTherefore, the average annual income of the remaining 95% of households is approximately $42,105.26.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation. For example, are there any households with zero income or negative income? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so it's safe to assume all households have positive incomes.\n\nAlso, the problem states \"average annual income,\" so we don't need to consider any other types of income or expenses.\n\nAdditionally, the problem seems to be purely about averaging and doesn't involve any probability or statistical concepts beyond basic averages.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the approach I've taken is correct, and the answer is approximately $42,105.26.\n\nMaybe I can round it to the nearest dollar for simplicity, making it $42,105.\n\nBut since the original averages are given with two decimal places, it's better to keep two decimal places in the answer as well.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately $42,105.26.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42105.26} \\]"
