        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. I understand that I'm picking one ball at a time, noting its color, and putting it back before picking again. This process is repeated three times. I need to find the probability of picking at least one red ball in these three attempts.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify what \"at least one red ball\" means. It means one or more red balls in the three picks. So, it could be one red, two reds, or all three reds.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the probability of each of these scenarios and then add them up. But that might be a bit tedious. There might be a smarter way.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the complement rule. The complement of picking at least one red ball is picking no red balls at all, which means picking blue balls in all three attempts. So, if I calculate the probability of picking all blue balls and subtract it from 1, I should get the probability of picking at least one red ball.\n\nThat sounds efficient. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, find the probability of picking a blue ball in one attempt. There are 3 blue balls out of 8 total balls, so the probability is 3/8.\n\nSince I'm picking with replacement, each pick is independent, and the probability remains the same for each pick.\n\nSo, the probability of picking blue balls in all three attempts is (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) = (3/8)^3.\n\nCalculating that, (3/8)^3 = 27/512.\n\nNow, the probability of picking at least one red ball is 1 - (probability of picking all blue balls) = 1 - 27/512.\n\nTo subtract fractions, I need a common denominator. 1 can be written as 512/512, so 512/512 - 27/512 = 485/512.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking at least one red ball in three attempts is 485/512.\n\nWait, should I check if this makes sense? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of picking exactly one red, exactly two reds, and exactly three reds, and then add them up.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking exactly one red ball.\n\nThere are three attempts, and I need exactly one red and two blue.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is 5/8, and blue is 3/8.\n\nSo, for one specific sequence, say red first, then blue, then blue, it would be (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8).\n\nBut the red ball could be in any of the three attempts. So, I need to multiply by 3 (for the three possible positions of the red ball).\n\nSo, probability of exactly one red = 3 \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8)^2.\n\nCalculating that: 3 \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (9/64) = 3 \u00d7 (45/512) = 135/512.\n\nNext, exactly two reds.\n\nSimilarly, probability of exactly two reds and one blue.\n\nThe reds can be in any two of the three attempts, so there are 3 choose 2 = 3 ways.\n\nProbability for one specific sequence, say red, red, blue, is (5/8)^2 \u00d7 (3/8).\n\nSo, total probability = 3 \u00d7 (5/8)^2 \u00d7 (3/8) = 3 \u00d7 (25/64) \u00d7 (3/8) = 3 \u00d7 (75/512) = 225/512.\n\nFinally, exactly three reds.\n\nProbability is (5/8)^3 = 125/512.\n\nNow, adding these up: 135/512 + 225/512 + 125/512 = (135 + 225 + 125)/512 = 485/512.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier using the complement rule. Good, that gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of binomial probability, since there are two outcomes (red or blue), independent trials, and constant probabilities.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is P(X = k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k),\n\nWhere n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success on a single trial, and C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nIn this case, n = 3, p = 5/8 (probability of picking a red ball), and k can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo, P(at least one red) = P(X >= 1) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3).\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, P(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X = 0), which is the same as the complement rule I used first.\n\nSo, both approaches lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking at least one red ball in three attempts is 485/512.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{485}{512}} \\]"
