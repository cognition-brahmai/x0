It features gods like Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon, and heroes such as Hercules and Achilles. These stories explain the origins of the world, the nature of gods, and the adventures of heroes. | Greek mythology has had a profound influence on Western literature, art, and architecture. Many words, concepts, and themes in modern culture trace back to Greek myths. For example, the Olympic Games are named after Mount Olympus, the home of the Greek gods. |\n| Native American  | Native American folklore is diverse, varying among different tribes and regions. It includes creation stories, legends of tricksters like Coyote or Raven, and stories about supernatural beings and natural phenomena. These narratives often serve to explain the world and teach moral lessons. | Native American folklore has influenced various aspects of modern American culture, including literature, art, and environmental awareness. Authors like Leslie Marmon Silko and Sherman Alexie incorporate Native American themes and storytelling techniques in their works. Additionally, there is a growing appreciation for Native American perspectives on ecology and spirituality. |\n| Indian           | Indian mythology is a vast collection of stories from various regions and religions, primarily Hinduism, but also Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. It includes epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, which feature gods, demigods, and heroic figures. These myths explore themes of dharma (duty), karma, and moksha (liberation). | Indian mythology has significantly impacted global culture through literature, film, and spirituality. The Mahabharata and Ramayana have been adapted into numerous films, TV series, and books worldwide. Additionally, concepts like yoga, meditation, and the idea of karma have become integral parts of modern spiritual practices across the globe. |\n\nI hope this table gives you a good overview of the folklore and myths from these three societies and their enduring impact on modern culture.
