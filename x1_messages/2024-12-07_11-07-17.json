        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving Station A going towards Station B at 60 mph, and the other leaving Station B going towards Station A at 40 mph. The distance between the stations is 500 miles. I need to find out how far from Station A they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds add up when calculating how quickly they'll meet. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph. That means they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 100 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance they need to cover before they meet is 500 miles. So, the time it takes for them to meet can be calculated by dividing the distance by their combined speed. Time = Distance / Speed = 500 miles / 100 mph = 5 hours.\n\nOkay, so they'll meet after 5 hours. But the question is asking how far from Station A they will meet. Since the first train is going at 60 mph, and it's been traveling for 5 hours, the distance it covers is Speed * Time = 60 mph * 5 hours = 300 miles.\n\nSo, they will meet 300 miles away from Station A.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the ratios of their speeds. The train from A is going at 60 mph, and the one from B at 40 mph. So, the ratio of their speeds is 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nThis means that the train from A covers 3 parts of the distance, and the one from B covers 2 parts, out of a total of 5 parts.\n\nThe total distance is 500 miles, so each part is 500 / 5 = 100 miles.\n\nTherefore, the train from A covers 3 parts, which is 3 * 100 = 300 miles.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 100 mph, and the time to meet is still 5 hours, leading to the same result.\n\nI think 300 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
