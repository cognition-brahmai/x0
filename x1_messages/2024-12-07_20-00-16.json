        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system to increase ridership by 20% over the next three years and maintain an average occupancy rate of at least 75%. We need to figure out how many additional buses are needed, the total mileage they'll cover, and the estimated fuel consumption.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're dealing with. Currently, there are 50,000 passengers riding the buses daily, with an average trip length of 5 miles. So, the total miles traveled by all passengers per day is:\n\nTotal passenger miles per day = Number of passengers \u00d7 Average trip length\n                              = 50,000 passengers \u00d7 5 miles\n                              = 250,000 passenger miles per day\n\nNow, the city wants to increase ridership by 20%. So, the target number of passengers per day will be:\n\nTarget passengers per day = Current passengers + (20% of current passengers)\n                           = 50,000 + (0.20 \u00d7 50,000)\n                           = 50,000 + 10,000\n                           = 60,000 passengers per day\n\nNext, we need to maintain an average occupancy rate of at least 75%. Occupancy rate is the ratio of the number of passengers to the seating capacity of the bus. So, if we know the seating capacity of each bus, we can calculate how many buses are needed to carry 60,000 passengers per day with at least 75% occupancy.\n\nBut wait, we don't know the seating capacity of each bus. Hmm. Maybe we can find that out from the current system. Let's see.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the current system has a certain number of buses, each with a specific seating capacity, and they operate a certain number of trips per day to carry the 50,000 passengers.\n\nHowever, since we don't have information about the current number of buses or their seating capacities, we might need to make some assumptions here.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each bus has a seating capacity of, say, 50 passengers. Is that a reasonable assumption? Bus capacities can vary, but for the sake of this calculation, we'll go with 50 passengers per bus.\n\nGiven that, the current system must be able to carry at least 50,000 passengers per day with buses that have a capacity of 50 passengers each.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current number of bus trips needed per day:\n\nCurrent bus trips per day = Total passengers per day / Seating capacity per bus\n                          = 50,000 passengers / 50 passengers per bus\n                          = 1,000 bus trips per day\n\nNow, if the city wants to increase ridership to 60,000 passengers per day, the number of bus trips needed would be:\n\nTarget bus trips per day = Target passengers per day / Seating capacity per bus\n                          = 60,000 passengers / 50 passengers per bus\n                          = 1,200 bus trips per day\n\nSo, the additional bus trips needed per day are:\n\nAdditional bus trips per day = Target bus trips per day - Current bus trips per day\n                              = 1,200 - 1,000\n                              = 200 bus trips per day\n\nBut we need to find out how many additional buses are needed, not just additional trips. To find that, we need to know how many trips each bus can make in a day.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each bus operates for, say, 12 hours per day. And let's assume the average trip time, including layover and turnaround time, is, say, 30 minutes.\n\nSo, number of trips per bus per day = (Operating hours per day \u00d7 60 minutes) / Trip time in minutes\n                                    = (12 hours \u00d7 60) / 30 minutes\n                                    = 720 minutes / 30 minutes\n                                    = 24 trips per bus per day\n\nTherefore, the number of additional buses needed is:\n\nAdditional buses needed = Additional bus trips per day / Trips per bus per day\n                         = 200 / 24\n                         \u2248 8.33\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bus, we'll need to round up to 9 additional buses.\n\nWait a minute, but we need to consider the occupancy rate. The problem states that the average occupancy rate should be at least 75%. Does our current calculation account for that?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check. Occupancy rate is the ratio of actual passengers to seating capacity. So, if the occupancy rate is 75%, that means each bus is carrying 75% of its seating capacity.\n\nIf the seating capacity is 50 passengers, then at 75% occupancy, each bus carries:\n\nPassengers per bus = Seating capacity \u00d7 Occupancy rate\n                   = 50 \u00d7 0.75\n                   = 37.5 passengers per bus\n\nBut wait, if each bus is only carrying 37.5 passengers on average, but we need to carry 60,000 passengers per day, then the number of bus trips needed would be:\n\nTarget bus trips per day = Target passengers per day / Passengers per bus\n                          = 60,000 / 37.5\n                          = 1,600 bus trips per day\n\nThat's higher than the 1,200 trips we calculated earlier, assuming full capacity.\n\nSo, our earlier calculation was incorrect because it assumed full capacity, but now we need to account for the occupancy rate.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nIf each bus carries 37.5 passengers on average, then to carry 60,000 passengers per day, we need:\n\nTarget bus trips per day = 60,000 / 37.5\n                          = 1,600 bus trips per day\n\nSimilarly, currently, with 50,000 passengers and 37.5 passengers per bus trip, the current number of bus trips should be:\n\nCurrent bus trips per day = 50,000 / 37.5\n                           \u2248 1,333.33 bus trips per day\n\nWait, but earlier we calculated 1,000 bus trips based on full capacity. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether we assume the buses are running at full capacity or at the average occupancy rate.\n\nLet me reframe this.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of buses required to achieve the desired passenger capacity, considering the occupancy rate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each bus has a seating capacity of 50 passengers, and they operate with an average occupancy rate of 75%, meaning each bus carries 37.5 passengers on average per trip.\n\nTo achieve the target of 60,000 passengers per day, we need:\n\nTotal bus trips required = Total passengers per day / Average passengers per bus trip\n                          = 60,000 / 37.5\n                          = 1,600 bus trips per day\n\nNow, if each bus can make 24 trips per day (as calculated earlier), the total number of buses required is:\n\nTotal buses required = Total bus trips required / Trips per bus per day\n                      = 1,600 / 24\n                      \u2248 66.67 buses\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bus, we'll need 67 buses.\n\nSimilarly, currently, with 50,000 passengers per day and the same occupancy rate, the number of bus trips needed is:\n\nCurrent bus trips required = 50,000 / 37.5\n                            \u2248 1,333.33 bus trips per day\n\nAnd the number of buses needed currently is:\n\nCurrent buses required = Current bus trips required / Trips per bus per day\n                        = 1,333.33 / 24\n                        \u2248 55.56 buses\n\nRounding up, that's 56 buses.\n\nTherefore, the additional buses needed are:\n\nAdditional buses needed = Total buses required - Current buses required\n                         = 67 - 56\n                         = 11 buses\n\nSo, the city needs to add 11 buses to its fleet to handle the increased ridership while maintaining a 75% occupancy rate.\n\nNow, let's move on to calculating the total mileage these additional buses will cover.\n\nFirst, we need to find out the mileage per bus trip.\n\nGiven that the average trip length is 5 miles, and assuming that each bus trip is 5 miles, then:\n\nMileage per bus trip = 5 miles\n\nTherefore, the total additional mileage per day is:\n\nAdditional mileage per day = Additional bus trips per day \u00d7 Mileage per bus trip\n                            = 200 bus trips \u00d7 5 miles\n                            = 1,000 miles per day\n\nWait, but earlier we calculated that additional bus trips per day are 200, based on full capacity. However, considering the occupancy rate, the total bus trips needed are 1,600, and current bus trips are approximately 1,333, so additional bus trips are:\n\nAdditional bus trips per day = 1,600 - 1,333\n                              \u2248 267 bus trips per day\n\nTherefore, the additional mileage per day is:\n\nAdditional mileage per day = 267 bus trips \u00d7 5 miles\n                            = 1,335 miles per day\n\nRounding up, approximately 1,335 miles per day.\n\nFinally, we need to estimate the fuel consumption for these additional buses.\n\nGiven that each bus gets 4 miles per gallon, the fuel consumption per mile is:\n\nFuel consumption per mile = 1 / 4 gallons per mile\n                          = 0.25 gallons per mile\n\nTherefore, the total additional fuel consumption per day is:\n\nAdditional fuel consumption per day = Additional mileage per day \u00d7 Fuel consumption per mile\n                                    = 1,335 miles \u00d7 0.25 gallons per mile\n                                    = 333.75 gallons per day\n\nSo, the additional buses will consume approximately 333.75 gallons of fuel per day.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Additional buses needed: 11 buses\n\n- Additional mileage per day: 1,335 miles\n\n- Additional fuel consumption per day: 333.75 gallons\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11 \\text{ buses},\\ 1,335 \\text{ miles},\\ 333.75 \\text{ gallons}} \\]"
