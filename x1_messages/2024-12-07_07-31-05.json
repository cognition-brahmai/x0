        "content": "To calculate the volume of water needed to fill a swimming pool with dimensions 25 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 6 feet deep, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume in cubic feet:**\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{depth}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the given dimensions:\n   \\[\n   V = 25 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 15 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   First, multiply the length and width:\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 15 = 375 \\, \\text{square feet}\n   \\]\n   Then, multiply the result by the depth:\n   \\[\n   375 \\times 6 = 2250 \\, \\text{cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert cubic feet to gallons:**\n   We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, to find the volume in gallons, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume in gallons} = 2250 \\, \\text{ft}^3 \\times 7.48 \\, \\text{gal/ft}^3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the final multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   2250 \\times 7.48 = 16,710 \\, \\text{gallons}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately 16,710 gallons of water to fill the swimming pool."
