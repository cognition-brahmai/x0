        "content": "You're referring to a specific type of bridge that is both functional and historically significant, particularly in London. The bridge you're thinking of is a bascule bridge, which is designed to be raised and lowered to permit the passage of ships. One of the most famous examples of such a bridge is Tower Bridge in London.\n\nTower Bridge is an iconic symbol of London and is recognized worldwide. It spans the River Thames and is known for its distinctive twin towers connected by walkways, with bascules that can be raised to allow large vessels to pass through. The bridge's design combines elements of suspension and bascule engineering, making it not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.\n\nBascule bridges are engineered to open quickly and efficiently, often using counterweights to balance the weight of the bridge deck, which makes raising and lowering it less energy-intensive. This design is particularly useful in areas with heavy maritime traffic, where frequent openings are necessary without causing significant delays to road traffic.\n\nIn summary, the type of bridge you're asking about is a bascule bridge, and Tower Bridge is a prime example of this engineering marvel in action."
