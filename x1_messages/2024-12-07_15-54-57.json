        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in total, each with a different color door. Specifically, there are 3 red doors, 2 blue doors, and the rest are green doors. I need to find out the probability that if I pick a house at random, it will have a green door.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many green doors there are. Since there are 10 houses in total, and 3 are red and 2 are blue, the number of green doors would be:\n\nNumber of green doors = Total houses - Red doors - Blue doors\nNumber of green doors = 10 - 3 - 2\nNumber of green doors = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 green doors.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a house with a green door, and the total possible outcomes are picking any house.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of picking a house with a green door is:\n\nP(green door) = Number of green doors / Total number of houses\nP(green door) = 5 / 10\nP(green door) = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2 or 0.5, which is equivalent to 50%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I know that probability can also be expressed in percentages, but in many mathematical contexts, it's left as a fraction or decimal. Maybe I should present it as a fraction in its simplest form.\n\nYes, 5/10 simplifies to 1/2. So, 1/2 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to express it as a decimal, it would be 0.5.\n\nOr, as a percentage, 50%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form of the answer, any of these would be acceptable. However, in mathematical terms, fractions are often preferred unless decimals or percentages are specified.\n\nLet me make sure there aren't any other factors to consider here. The problem says that each house has a different color door, but then specifies the numbers of red and blue doors, with the rest being green. So, the fact that each house has a different color door might be a bit misleading because it suggests that all doors are unique in color, but actually, there are multiple doors of the same color.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The problem says each house has a different color door, but then specifies that there are 3 red, 2 blue, and the rest green. That seems contradictory at first because if each house has a different color door, I would expect each door to have a unique color. However, perhaps the problem means that there are different colors represented among the houses, but multiple houses share the same color.\n\nActually, re-reading the problem, it says \"each house has a different color door\" and then specifies \"3 red doors, 2 blue doors, and the rest are green doors.\" This seems inconsistent because if each house has a different color door, there shouldn't be multiple houses with the same color door.\n\nPerhaps I misread it. Let me look again.\n\n\"In a small village, there are 10 houses. Each house has a different color door. There are 3 red doors, 2 blue doors, and the rest are green doors. If you randomly pick a house to visit, what is the probability that it will have a green door?\"\n\nWait, this is confusing. If each house has a different color door, how can there be multiple houses with the same color door?\n\nMaybe the \"each house has a different color door\" part is not strictly true, or perhaps it's a typo. In reality, if there are multiple houses with the same door color, then not all doors are of different colors.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial statement \"each house has a different color door\" is incorrect or misphrased. Maybe it's meant to say that there are doors of different colors, but not necessarily each house having a unique color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are 10 different colors, but among them, three are referred to as \"red,\" two as \"blue,\" and five as \"green,\" which would mean there are multiple houses with the same color door, despite the initial statement.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that there are 10 houses, with 3 red doors, 2 blue doors, and 5 green doors, ignoring the \"each house has a different color door\" part, as it seems contradictory.\n\nIn that case, the probability calculation I did earlier still holds: 5 green doors out of 10 houses gives a probability of 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each house has a unique color door, then the statement about 3 red, 2 blue, and the rest green doesn't make sense, because that would imply that some colors are repeated.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe it's meant to say that there are doors of different colors, but multiple houses can have the same color door.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the calculation I did initially: 5 green doors out of 10 houses, giving a probability of 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each house has a unique color door, then the probability would be based on the number of houses with green doors divided by the total number of houses, but in that case, the counts of red and blue doors don't add up to unique colors.\n\nWait, let's try to reconcile this.\n\nSuppose there are 10 houses, each with a unique color door. But then the statement about 3 red, 2 blue, and the rest green doesn't make sense because each door is a unique color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"each house has a different color door\" was meant to describe that in previous scenarios, but in this particular problem, it's overridden by the specific counts given: 3 red, 2 blue, and 5 green.\n\nGiven that, I think it's safe to proceed with the counts provided and calculate the probability based on that.\n\nTherefore, with 5 green doors out of 10 houses, the probability is 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the answer is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
