        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A farmer has a rectangular field that's 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide this field into square plots, all the same size, without leaving any leftover area. I need to figure out what the side length of each square plot should be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The field is rectangular, with dimensions 100m by 60m, and I need to divide it into squares of equal size, meaning all squares have the same side length, and there should be no area left over. So, essentially, the squares should fit perfectly inside the rectangle without any gaps or overlaps.\n\nTo visualize this, imagine a big rectangle, and you're trying to fill it up completely with smaller squares, all of the same size. The side length of these squares needs to be such that it divides both the length and the width of the rectangle evenly. That way, there are no leftover spaces.\n\nSo, mathematically, I need to find a number that divides both 100 and 60 perfectly. In other words, I'm looking for a common divisor of 100 and 60. But since I want the squares to be as large as possible (assuming that's what's being asked, because dividing into the least number of squares is often desirable, but the question doesn't specify), I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 60. The GCD will give me the largest possible side length for the squares that can fit perfectly into both dimensions.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both.\n\nFirst, find the divisors of 100:\n\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nNow, find the divisors of 60:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.\n\nNow, look for the common divisors:\n\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.\n\nThe largest common divisor is 20.\n\nSo, the side length of each square plot should be 20 meters.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if 20 meters indeed divides both 100 and 60 without leaving any remainder.\n\n100 divided by 20 is 5, which is a whole number.\n\n60 divided by 20 is 3, which is also a whole number.\n\nPerfect, so 20 meters is a valid side length.\n\nBut the question is, what is the side length of each square plot? Is there only one possible answer?\n\nWell, actually, there are multiple possible side lengths that would work, as any common divisor would allow the squares to fit perfectly into the rectangle. For example, 10 meters would also work, as 10 divides both 100 and 60 evenly.\n\nBut I think the question is implying to find the largest possible square plot, which would be the GCD, which is 20 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to find all possible side lengths that would work.\n\nLet me see. The question says, \"divide the field into square plots of equal size without any leftover area.\" It doesn't specify that the squares have to be the largest possible, just that they are of equal size and there's no leftover area.\n\nSo, technically, any common divisor of 100 and 60 could be a possible side length for the square plots.\n\nBut perhaps the question is to find the side length of each square plot, implying a single answer, likely the largest possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's to find the side length in general, without specifying the largest.\n\nWait, let's look back at the question: \"What is the side length of each square plot?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify \"the largest possible\" or \"all possible,\" just \"the side length.\"\n\nGiven that, and considering that there could be multiple answers, perhaps the expectation is to provide the largest possible side length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find the side length in a way that the number of square plots is minimized, which would again point to using the largest possible square plots.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider all possible side lengths.\n\nSo, as I listed earlier, the common divisors of 100 and 60 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.\n\nTherefore, the possible side lengths for the square plots are 1m, 2m, 4m, 5m, 10m, and 20m.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting just one answer, the largest possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard approach to this type of problem.\n\nLet me consider the context. This seems like a problem related to finding the greatest common divisor, as that's a common application of GCD in real-world scenarios: dividing areas or lengths into equal parts without waste.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the GCD of 100 and 60 is 20, it makes sense that the largest possible square plot would have a side length of 20 meters.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think about it differently.\n\nIf I choose a side length of 20 meters, then:\n\n- The length of the field is 100m, so 100 / 20 = 5 squares along the length.\n\n- The width is 60m, so 60 / 20 = 3 squares along the width.\n\n- Therefore, the field would be divided into 5 x 3 = 15 square plots of 20m x 20m each.\n\n- Since both 100 and 60 are divisible by 20 without remainder, there would be no leftover area.\n\nNow, if I choose a smaller side length, say 10m:\n\n- Along the length: 100 / 10 = 10 squares.\n\n- Along the width: 60 / 10 = 6 squares.\n\n- Total squares: 10 x 6 = 60 square plots of 10m x 10m.\n\n- Again, no leftover area.\n\nBut the question likely expects the largest possible square plot, which is 20m x 20m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to determine this.\n\nI recall that when dividing a rectangle into squares of equal size without leftover area, the side length of the square should be equal to the GCD of the length and width of the rectangle.\n\nSo, in this case, GCD of 100 and 60 is 20, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the side length of each square plot is 20 meters.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that I might have missed.\n\nFor example, is there a possibility that non-integer side lengths could be considered? The problem states \"square plots of equal size without any leftover area,\" and it gives dimensions in meters, so it's safe to assume that the side lengths are in meters and likely integers, but not necessarily.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, having a fractional meter side length might not be desirable for a farmer, but mathematically, it's possible.\n\nBut since both 100 and 60 are integers, and the divisors are integers, it's reasonable to stick with integer side lengths.\n\nMoreover, the GCD approach ensures that the side length is an integer if the dimensions are integers.\n\nTherefore, the side length of each square plot is 20 meters.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should verify if 20 is indeed the GCD of 100 and 60.\n\nLet me use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying the formula:\n\nGCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b), until b becomes zero.\n\nSo, GCD(100, 60):\n\n100 divided by 60 is 1 with a remainder of 40.\n\nSo, GCD(100, 60) = GCD(60, 40).\n\nNow, GCD(60, 40):\n\n60 divided by 40 is 1 with a remainder of 20.\n\nSo, GCD(60, 40) = GCD(40, 20).\n\nNow, GCD(40, 20):\n\n40 divided by 20 is 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, GCD(40, 20) = GCD(20, 0) = 20.\n\nTherefore, the GCD is indeed 20.\n\nHence, the side length of each square plot is 20 meters.\n\nBut just to explore further, what if the side length was larger than 20 meters? For example, 25 meters.\n\n100 divided by 25 is 4, which is fine.\n\n60 divided by 25 is 2.4, which is not an integer.\n\nSo, there would be leftover area along the width, as 25 meters doesn't divide evenly into 60 meters.\n\nTherefore, 25 meters is not a valid side length for the square plots in this scenario.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose a side length smaller than 20 meters, say 10 meters, as I did earlier, it works, but it's not the largest possible.\n\nTherefore, confirming that 20 meters is indeed the largest possible side length for the square plots that can divide the field without any leftover area.\n\nSo, the answer is that the side length of each square plot is 20 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
