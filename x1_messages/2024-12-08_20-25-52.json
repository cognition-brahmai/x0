        "content": "During the 2020 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris, who was the Democratic nominee for Vice President running alongside Joe Biden, advocated for significant criminal justice reform. Harris emphasized the need to address systemic issues within the criminal justice system, particularly regarding racial disparities and police brutality.\n\nOne of her key proposals was to implement reforms aimed at reducing mass incarceration by addressing mandatory minimum sentences and expanding alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenses. She also supported the legalization of marijuana and the expungement of related criminal records to help individuals rebuild their lives.\n\nMoreover, Harris called for increased police accountability and transparency. She proposed creating a national standard for police use of force and supporting community-led policing initiatives. Harris also advocated for investing in communities most affected by crime and violence, focusing on prevention and rehabilitation rather than solely on punishment.\n\nOverall, Harris's stance on criminal justice reform during the campaign reflected a commitment to addressing inequalities and promoting fairness and safety for all Americans."
