The average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nLet's denote the distance between Town A and Town B as \\( d \\) kilometers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip:\n\n1. **Trip from Town A to Town B:**\n   - Speed: 60 km/h\n   - Distance: \\( d \\) km\n   - Time: \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours\n\n2. **Return trip from Town B to Town A:**\n   - Speed: 90 km/h\n   - Distance: \\( d \\) km\n   - Time: \\( t_2 = \\frac{d}{90} \\) hours\n\nNext, we find the total distance and the total time for the round trip:\n\n- **Total distance:** \\( 2d \\) km (since the train travels from A to B and back to A)\n\n- **Total time:** \\( t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{90} \\) hours\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nt_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{90} = \\frac{3d}{180} + \\frac{2d}{180} = \\frac{5d}{180} = \\frac{d}{36} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, the average speed \\( v_{\\text{avg}} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{36}} = 2d \\times \\frac{36}{d} = 72 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire round trip is 72 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
