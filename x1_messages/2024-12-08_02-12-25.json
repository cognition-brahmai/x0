        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train's average speed. Let me see if I can figure this out. The train travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then it slows down to 30 miles per hour for another 2 hours. I need to find the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. I think it's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Is that right? Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, average speed equals total distance over total time.\n\nAlright, so let's calculate the total distance first. For the first part of the trip, the train is going at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, distance equals speed times time, right? So, 60 miles per hour times 2 hours is 120 miles.\n\nThen, for the second part, it's going at 30 miles per hour for another 2 hours. So, 30 miles per hour times 2 hours is 60 miles.\n\nNow, total distance is 120 miles plus 60 miles, which is 180 miles.\n\nNext, total time is 2 hours plus 2 hours, which is 4 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance over total time, which is 180 miles over 4 hours. That equals 45 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that average speed isn't always just the total distance over total time. Sometimes, if speeds are different for different parts of the trip, you might need to do something else. Maybe I should check if there's another way to calculate it.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I can find the harmonic mean of the speeds, since it's about rates and travel times.\n\nThe formula for average speed when distances are the same is different, I think. But in this case, the distances are not the same. The first part is 120 miles and the second is 60 miles.\n\nWait, no, the times are the same for each part, both are 2 hours. So, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me see, perhaps I should consider the weighted average of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, speed1 is 60 mph for 2 hours, and speed2 is 30 mph for 2 hours.\n\nSo, the weighted average would be (60 mph * 2 hours + 30 mph * 2 hours) divided by total time, which is 4 hours.\n\nThat gives (120 + 60) divided by 4, which is 180 divided by 4, which is still 45 mph.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I think about the entire trip as two equal time intervals. Since both parts are 2 hours each, maybe I can just take the average of the two speeds.\n\nSo, (60 mph + 30 mph)/2 = 45 mph.\n\nAgain, I get 45 mph.\n\nWait, but I recall that averaging speeds directly only works if the distances are equal, not the times. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, actually, averaging speeds directly like that is only for when distances are equal. Since in this case, times are equal, but distances are different, maybe that's why it's working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for average speed, which is total distance over total time, as I did earlier.\n\nLet me double-check with another approach.\n\nSuppose I plot a velocity-time graph. Velocity on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.\n\nFor the first 2 hours, velocity is 60 mph, and then for the next 2 hours, it's 30 mph.\n\nSo, the area under the curve would give me the total distance.\n\nFrom time 0 to 2 hours, it's a rectangle with height 60 and width 2, so area is 120 miles.\n\nFrom time 2 to 4 hours, it's a rectangle with height 30 and width 2, so area is 60 miles.\n\nTotal area is 180 miles, and total time is 4 hours, so average speed is 180/4 = 45 mph.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for average speed when there are two different speeds for equal times.\n\nI think there is a formula for that.\n\nLet me see, average speed = (v1 * t1 + v2 * t2)/(t1 + t2).\n\nIn this case, v1 = 60 mph, t1 = 2 hours, v2 = 30 mph, t2 = 2 hours.\n\nSo, (60*2 + 30*2)/(2+2) = (120 + 60)/4 = 180/4 = 45 mph.\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, if times were different, I would need to adjust accordingly.\n\nBut in this case, since times are equal, it's straightforward.\n\nWait, but I've heard that average speed is not always the arithmetic mean of the speeds.\n\nYes, that's true, especially when distances are equal, you use the harmonic mean.\n\nFor example, if the train travels two equal distances at different speeds, then the average speed would be the harmonic mean.\n\nBut in this problem, the times are equal, not the distances.\n\nSo, in this case, using the arithmetic mean is appropriate.\n\nWait, but in this case, the times are equal, and I'm using the arithmetic mean, which gives me 45 mph.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the distances were equal, then I would use the harmonic mean.\n\nFor example, if the train travels two equal distances, say d miles each, at speeds v1 and v2, then the average speed is (2*d)/(d/v1 + d/v2) = 2*v1*v2/(v1 + v2).\n\nBut in this problem, the times are equal, not the distances.\n\nSo, average speed is (v1*t + v2*t)/(t + t) = (v1 + v2)/2.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nSo, in this case, average speed is indeed the arithmetic mean of the two speeds, since the times are equal.\n\nTherefore, 45 mph is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the times were different.\n\nSuppose the train traveled at 60 mph for 1 hour and then at 30 mph for 3 hours.\n\nThen, total distance would be 60*1 + 30*3 = 60 + 90 = 150 miles.\n\nTotal time is 4 hours.\n\nAverage speed is 150/4 = 37.5 mph.\n\nWhich is not the arithmetic mean of 60 and 30.\n\nThe arithmetic mean would be (60 + 30)/2 = 45 mph, which is not the case here.\n\nSo, in this scenario, where times are different, the average speed is not the arithmetic mean of the speeds.\n\nBut in the original problem, times are equal, so it works out to be the arithmetic mean.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, average speed is 45 mph.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the total distance and total time.\n\nTotal distance is 180 miles, total time is 4 hours, so average speed is 45 mph.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can consider the problem in terms of the definition of average speed.\n\nAverage speed is the rate of change of total distance with respect to total time.\n\nSo, over the entire trip, the train covers 180 miles in 4 hours, so the average speed is 45 mph.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the instantaneous speed at different times, and take the average, it should still be 45 mph.\n\nBut since the speed is constant in each interval, the average is straightforward.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways.\n\nSo, the answer should be 45 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
