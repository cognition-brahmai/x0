        "content": "So I have this cylindrical container, and I need to figure out how many gallons of water it can hold. The container has a radius of 4 inches and a height of 10 inches. I know that 1 gallon is about 231 cubic inches. Okay, first things first, I need to find the volume of the cylinder because that will tell me how much space is inside it, right?\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. So, plugging in the values, that's V = \u03c0*(4 inches)\u00b2*(10 inches). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 4 inches squared is 16 square inches. Then, multiplied by 10 inches, that's 160 cubic inches. Now, I need to multiply that by \u03c0. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 160 inches cubed times 3.1416 is... let's see, 160 * 3.1416 = 502.656 cubic inches.\n\nAlright, so the cylinder can hold about 502.656 cubic inches of water. Now, I need to convert that into gallons. Since 1 gallon is approximately 231 cubic inches, I can find out how many gallons by dividing the total cubic inches by 231.\n\nSo, 502.656 cubic inches \u00f7 231 cubic inches per gallon. Let's do that division. 502.656 \u00f7 231 is roughly 2.176 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the cylindrical container can hold approximately 2.176 gallons of water.\n\nWait a minute, should I consider significant figures here? The given values are 4 inches, 10 inches, and 231 cubic inches, which have 1 significant figure, 2 significant figures, and 3 significant figures respectively. But perhaps I should report the answer to 3 significant figures since that's the most precise given value.\n\nSo, 2.176 gallons would round to 2.18 gallons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the height is given as 10 inches, which might be considered to have 1 significant figure, but typically, when a number like 10 is given, it's ambiguous in terms of significant figures. Maybe I should assume it has 2 significant figures.\n\nGiven that, perhaps reporting to 2 decimal places is appropriate.\n\nSo, 2.18 gallons seems acceptable.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nVolume of cylinder: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0*(4)^2*(10) = \u03c0*16*10 = 160\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, V \u2248 160*3.1416 = 502.656 cubic inches.\n\nNow, 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches.\n\nSo, gallons = 502.656 / 231 \u2248 2.176 gallons.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise value of \u03c0, but since the other values are given to a certain precision, it's probably okay to stick with this.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 2.18 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.18} \\]"
