        "content": "So I have this problem here. I start with 50 apples in my basket. Then, I give away 2 apples to each friend I meet. After meeting 7 friends, I need to figure out how many apples I have left. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to determine how many apples I give away in total. I'm giving 2 apples to each friend, and I meet 7 friends. So, the total number of apples given away should be 2 apples per friend times 7 friends. That is:\n\n2 apples/friend \u00d7 7 friends = 14 apples\n\nNow, I started with 50 apples and gave away 14 apples. To find out how many I have left, I subtract the apples given away from the initial amount:\n\n50 apples - 14 apples = 36 apples\n\nSo, I should have 36 apples left.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way could be to think about it step by step, for each friend I meet. I give away 2 apples each time.\n\nStarting with 50 apples:\n\n- After meeting the 1st friend: 50 - 2 = 48 apples\n\n- After meeting the 2nd friend: 48 - 2 = 46 apples\n\n- After meeting the 3rd friend: 46 - 2 = 44 apples\n\n- After meeting the 4th friend: 44 - 2 = 42 apples\n\n- After meeting the 5th friend: 42 - 2 = 40 apples\n\n- After meeting the 6th friend: 40 - 2 = 38 apples\n\n- After meeting the 7th friend: 38 - 2 = 36 apples\n\nOkay, so again, I end up with 36 apples after meeting 7 friends.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of a formula. If I have an initial number of apples, and I give away a fixed number per friend, the remaining apples would be:\n\nRemaining apples = Initial apples - (Apples per friend \u00d7 Number of friends)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nRemaining apples = 50 - (2 \u00d7 7) = 50 - 14 = 36\n\nSame answer again. Seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. For example, does the order in which I meet friends matter? Probably not, since I'm giving away the same amount to each. Are there any apples being added back to the basket? No, according to the problem. So, no need to account for any additions.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the numbers make sense. Starting with 50, giving away 14, ending with 36. That seems logical and correct.\n\nOne more thing: I should consider if there's a possibility of giving away more apples than I have. But in this case, I'm giving away 14 apples, and I start with 50, so I don't run into any negative numbers or anything like that.\n\nAll right, I think I've confirmed the answer in multiple ways. I'm confident that after meeting 7 friends and giving away 2 apples to each, I have 36 apples left in my basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
