        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a restaurant and their meal options. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are three meal options: A, B, and C. Each day, 40% of customers choose option A, 35% choose option B, and 25% choose option C. The restaurant serves 200 customers per day, and I need to find out how many customers choose each option over a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many customers choose each option per day, and then multiply that by 7 to get the weekly total. That sounds straightforward.\n\nSo, for option A, 40% of 200 customers choose it each day. To find that, I can calculate 40% of 200. Let's see:\n\n40% of 200 is 0.4 times 200, which is 80 customers per day for option A.\n\nSimilarly, for option B, 35% of 200 customers choose it each day. So, 35% of 200 is 0.35 times 200, which is 70 customers per day for option B.\n\nFor option C, 25% of 200 customers choose it each day. So, 25% of 200 is 0.25 times 200, which is 50 customers per day for option C.\n\nNow, to find out how many customers choose each option over a week, I need to multiply these daily numbers by 7.\n\nSo, for option A: 80 customers per day times 7 days is 560 customers per week.\n\nFor option B: 70 customers per day times 7 days is 490 customers per week.\n\nFor option C: 50 customers per day times 7 days is 350 customers per week.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. The percentages add up to 100%, which is good: 40% + 35% + 25% = 100%. And the total customers per day are 200.\n\nSo, per day:\n\n- A: 80\n\n- B: 70\n\n- C: 50\n\nTotal per day: 80 + 70 + 50 = 200, which matches the given number.\n\nThen, over 7 days:\n\n- A: 560\n\n- B: 490\n\n- C: 350\n\nTotal per week: 560 + 490 + 350 = 1400 customers in a week.\n\nAlternatively, 200 customers per day times 7 days equals 1400, which matches.\n\nSo, the restaurant will have 560 customers choosing option A, 490 choosing option B, and 350 choosing option C over a week.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved, like whether the percentages change over the days or if there are any holidays or something. But the problem doesn't mention any variations, so I assume the percentages are constant every day.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the numbers are whole numbers since you can't have a fraction of a customer. In this case, all the calculations resulted in whole numbers, so that's fine.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The restaurant will have 560 customers for option A, 490 for option B, and 350 for option C in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{560 \\text{ customers for option A, } 490 \\text{ for option B, and } 350 \\text{ for option C in a week}} \\]"
