        "content": "Let's calculate the total weight of the candy bars the customer bought.\n\nFirst, we need to find out the weight of the small candy bars. Each small candy bar weighs 80 grams, and the customer bought 3 of them. So, the total weight for the small candy bars is:\n\n3 small candy bars * 80 grams per small candy bar = 240 grams\n\nNext, we'll calculate the weight of the large candy bars. Each large candy bar weighs 150 grams, and the customer bought 2 of them. So, the total weight for the large candy bars is:\n\n2 large candy bars * 150 grams per large candy bar = 300 grams\n\nNow, to find the total weight of all the candy bars combined, we add the weight of the small candy bars and the weight of the large candy bars:\n\n240 grams + 300 grams = 540 grams\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the customer's purchase is 540 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{540 \\text{ grams}} \\]"
