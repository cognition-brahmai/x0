        "content": "Actually, the term \"dark side of the Moon\" is a bit misleading. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, meaning that it always presents the same face towards us. So, from our perspective, there's a far side of the Moon that we can't see directly. However, both sides of the Moon receive sunlight at different times during its orbit.\n\nJust like Earth has day and night cycles, the Moon also experiences daylight and darkness as it orbits the Earth. When we talk about the \"dark side,\" people often think it's always dark, but that's not the case. The far side of the Moon gets sunlight just like the near side; it's just that we don't see it from Earth.\n\nSo, to clarify, there isn't a permanently dark side of the Moon. Both sides experience sunlight and darkness in their own cycles."
