        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 types of candy bars with prices $1.50, $2.00, $2.50, and $3.00. The customer buys an equal number of each type and spends a total of $36. I need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, since the customer buys an equal number of each type, let's say they bought x number of each type. So, they bought x candy bars at $1.50 each, x at $2.00 each, x at $2.50 each, and x at $3.00 each.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total cost. The total cost would be the sum of the costs of each type:\n\nTotal cost = (number of type 1 * price of type 1) + (number of type 2 * price of type 2) + (number of type 3 * price of type 3) + (number of type 4 * price of type 4)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal cost = (x * 1.50) + (x * 2.00) + (x * 2.50) + (x * 3.00)\n\nI can factor out the x:\n\nTotal cost = x * (1.50 + 2.00 + 2.50 + 3.00)\n\nNow, let's add up the prices inside the parentheses:\n\n1.50 + 2.00 = 3.50\n\n3.50 + 2.50 = 6.00\n\n6.00 + 3.00 = 9.00\n\nSo, total cost = x * 9.00\n\nBut I know that the total cost is $36, so:\n\nx * 9.00 = 36\n\nNow, I can solve for x by dividing both sides by 9.00:\n\nx = 36 / 9.00\n\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 4 of each type of candy bar.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If they bought 4 of each type:\n\n4 * 1.50 = 6.00 for type 1\n\n4 * 2.00 = 8.00 for type 2\n\n4 * 2.50 = 10.00 for type 3\n\n4 * 3.00 = 12.00 for type 4\n\nNow, adding those up: 6.00 + 8.00 = 14.00\n\n14.00 + 10.00 = 24.00\n\n24.00 + 12.00 = 36.00\n\nYes, that matches the total spent. So, the answer is 4 of each type.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
