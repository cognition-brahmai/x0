        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual budget of $1,200,000. They allocate 30% to salaries, 20% to office expenses, and 10% to marketing. I need to find out how much money is left unallocated.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much each allocation is in dollars.\n\nStarting with salaries:\n\n30% of $1,200,000 is calculated as:\n\n0.30 * 1,200,000 = 360,000\n\nSo, $360,000 is allocated to salaries.\n\nNext, office expenses:\n\n20% of $1,200,000 is:\n\n0.20 * 1,200,000 = 240,000\n\nSo, $240,000 is allocated to office expenses.\n\nThen, marketing:\n\n10% of $1,200,000 is:\n\n0.10 * 1,200,000 = 120,000\n\nSo, $120,000 is allocated to marketing.\n\nNow, I need to add up these allocated amounts to see how much has been assigned in total.\n\n360,000 (salaries) + 240,000 (office expenses) + 120,000 (marketing) = 720,000\n\nSo, a total of $720,000 has been allocated.\n\nTo find the unallocated amount, I subtract the total allocated amount from the total budget.\n\n1,200,000 - 720,000 = 480,000\n\nTherefore, $480,000 is left unallocated.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to approach this. Instead of calculating each allocation separately and then subtracting, perhaps I can calculate the total percentage allocated and then find the remaining percentage of the budget.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe total percentage allocated is:\n\n30% (salaries) + 20% (office expenses) + 10% (marketing) = 60%\n\nSo, 60% of the budget is allocated, which means 40% is unallocated.\n\nNow, 40% of $1,200,000 is:\n\n0.40 * 1,200,000 = 480,000\n\nAgain, $480,000 is unallocated.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could verify by calculating each allocation again and ensuring the additions and subtractions are correct.\n\nBut both methods give me the same result, so I think $480,000 is the correct unallocated amount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480000} \\]"
