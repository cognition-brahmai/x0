The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the distance is 540 miles and the speed is 45 mph, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{540 \\text{ miles}}{45 \\text{ mph}}\n\\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the car 12 hours to reach its destination, assuming no stops or delays."
