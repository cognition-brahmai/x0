        "content": "So the factory originally produces 500 units of Product A per day. Then, because there's more demand, they want to increase their production by 20%. I need to figure out how many units they produce after this increase.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 20% increase means. Percentage increases are based on the original amount, right? So, 20% of 500 units is the amount they're adding to the original production.\n\nTo find 20% of 500, I can calculate it by multiplying 500 by 20% or 0.20 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 500 times 0.20 equals 100 units.\n\nThat means they're adding 100 units to their original production of 500 units.\n\nTherefore, the new production rate should be 500 plus 100, which equals 600 units per day.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at percentage increases is to multiply the original amount by 1 plus the percentage increase in decimal form.\n\nSo, 1 plus 0.20 equals 1.20.\n\nThen, 500 units times 1.20 equals 600 units.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI can also think about it in terms of proportions. If 100% of production is 500 units, then 20% more would be 120% of the original production.\n\nConverting 120% to decimal is 1.20, and 500 times 1.20 is again 600 units.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The factory produces 600 units of Product A per day after the increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
