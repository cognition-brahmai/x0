        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that's traveling at two different speeds for different durations. First, it goes at 90 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, and then it slows down to 60 kilometers per hour for another 3 hours. We need to find out the total distance it travels.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part of the journey, the distance should be 90 km/h times 5 hours. Let me do that calculation:\n\n90 km/h \u00d7 5 h = 450 kilometers.\n\nOkay, so in the first part, the train travels 450 kilometers.\n\nNow, for the second part, it's traveling at a slower speed of 60 kilometers per hour for 3 hours. So, the distance for this part should be 60 km/h times 3 hours.\n\n60 km/h \u00d7 3 h = 180 kilometers.\n\nSo, in the second part, the train travels 180 kilometers.\n\nTo find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\n450 km + 180 km = 630 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the train travels a total of 630 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the average speed for the entire journey or something like that. But, since the speeds are different for different periods, it might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for average speed, which is total distance over total time. But in this case, I don't know the total distance yet; that's what I'm trying to find. So, maybe that's not helpful right now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the distances separately and then sum them up, which is what I already did. It seems straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst part: 90 km/h \u00d7 5 h = 450 km. That seems correct.\n\nSecond part: 60 km/h \u00d7 3 h = 180 km. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up: 450 km + 180 km = 630 km. Yeah, that's right.\n\nI think that's the answer. The train travels a total of 630 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{630} \\]\n"
