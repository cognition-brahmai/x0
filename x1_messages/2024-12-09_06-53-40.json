        "content": "A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. It plays a crucial role in various chemical processes by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. The catalyst participates in the reaction but is regenerated at the end, remaining chemically unchanged. This property makes catalysts invaluable in industrial processes, where they can be reused multiple times, reducing costs and improving efficiency."
