        "content": "Okay, I have this initial value problem to solve: y'' + 2y' + y = e^(-t), with initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = -1. I need to use Laplace transforms to find the solution. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that the Laplace transform of a function y(t) is denoted by Y(s), where s is a complex variable. The Laplace transform has properties that allow us to transform differential equations into algebraic equations, which are often easier to solve.\n\nSo, I need to take the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation y'' + 2y' + y = e^(-t).\n\nLet's start by finding the Laplace transforms of each term individually.\n\n1. The Laplace transform of y''(t):\n\nI know that the Laplace transform of the second derivative is given by:\n\nL{y''(t)} = s^2 Y(s) - s y(0) - y'(0)\n\nGiven that y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = -1, this becomes:\n\nL{y''(t)} = s^2 Y(s) - s(1) - (-1) = s^2 Y(s) - s + 1\n\n2. The Laplace transform of 2y'(t):\n\nFirst, the Laplace transform of y'(t) is:\n\nL{y'(t)} = s Y(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - 1\n\nTherefore, the transform of 2y'(t) is:\n\n2 L{y'(t)} = 2(s Y(s) - 1) = 2s Y(s) - 2\n\n3. The Laplace transform of y(t):\n\nThis is simply Y(s).\n\n4. The Laplace transform of e^(-t):\n\nI recall that the Laplace transform of e^(at) is 1/(s - a), for a = -1 in this case:\n\nL{e^(-t)} = 1/(s + 1)\n\nNow, putting it all together, the transformed equation is:\n\nL{y''} + 2 L{y'} + L{y} = L{e^(-t)}\n\nSubstituting the expressions we found:\n\n(s^2 Y(s) - s + 1) + 2(s Y(s) - 1) + Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nLet's simplify the left-hand side:\n\ns^2 Y(s) - s + 1 + 2s Y(s) - 2 + Y(s) = (s^2 + 2s + 1) Y(s) - s + 1 - 2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(s^2 + 2s + 1) Y(s) - s - 1 = 1/(s + 1)\n\nNow, solve for Y(s):\n\n(s^2 + 2s + 1) Y(s) = 1/(s + 1) + s + 1\n\nFactor the denominator:\n\ns^2 + 2s + 1 = (s + 1)^2\n\nSo:\n\n(s + 1)^2 Y(s) = 1/(s + 1) + s + 1\n\nTherefore:\n\nY(s) = [1/(s + 1)] / (s + 1)^2 + (s + 1)/(s + 1)^2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nY(s) = 1/(s + 1)^3 + 1/(s + 1)\n\nNow, to find y(t), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s).\n\nFirst, recall that:\n\nL^{-1}{1/(s + a)^n} = (t^{n-1} e^{-at}) / (n-1)!\n\nFor the first term, 1/(s + 1)^3:\n\nL^{-1}{1/(s + 1)^3} = (t^{2} e^{-t}) / 2\n\nFor the second term, 1/(s + 1):\n\nL^{-1}{1/(s + 1)} = e^{-t}\n\nTherefore, the solution y(t) is:\n\ny(t) = (t^2 e^{-t}) / 2 + e^{-t}\n\nSimplify:\n\ny(t) = e^{-t} (1 + t^2 / 2)\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I think I missed something in combining the terms.\n\nActually, the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)^3 + 1/(s + 1) is indeed y(t) = (t^2 e^{-t}) / 2 + e^{-t}.\n\nBut perhaps I should verify this solution by plugging it back into the original differential equation to ensure it satisfies both the equation and the initial conditions.\n\nFirst, check the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = e^{0} (1 + 0) = 1 * 1 = 1, which matches y(0) = 1.\n\ny'(t) = d/dt [e^{-t} (1 + t^2 / 2)]\n\nUse the product rule:\n\ny'(t) = e^{-t} (-1)(1 + t^2 / 2) + e^{-t} (t)\n\nSimplify:\n\ny'(t) = e^{-t} [-1 - t^2 / 2 + t]\n\nAt t = 0:\n\ny'(0) = e^{0} [-1 - 0 + 0] = -1, which matches y'(0) = -1.\n\nNow, let's plug y(t) back into the differential equation:\n\ny'' + 2y' + y = e^{-t}\n\nFirst, find y''(t):\n\ny'(t) = e^{-t} (-1 - t^2 / 2 + t)\n\ny''(t) = d/dt [e^{-t} (-1 - t^2 / 2 + t)]\n\nAgain, use the product rule:\n\ny''(t) = e^{-t} (-1 - t^2 / 2 + t)' + (-1) e^{-t} (-1 - t^2 / 2 + t)\n\nCompute the derivative:\n\n(-1 - t^2 / 2 + t)' = -t + 1\n\nSo:\n\ny''(t) = e^{-t} (-t + 1) + (-1) e^{-t} (-1 - t^2 / 2 + t)\n\nSimplify:\n\ny''(t) = e^{-t} (-t + 1) + e^{-t} (1 + t^2 / 2 - t)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ny''(t) = e^{-t} [(-t + 1) + (1 + t^2 / 2 - t)] = e^{-t} [-2t + 2 + t^2 / 2]\n\nNow, compute y'' + 2y' + y:\n\ny'' + 2y' + y = e^{-t} [-2t + 2 + t^2 / 2] + 2 e^{-t} [-1 - t^2 / 2 + t] + e^{-t} [1 + t^2 / 2]\n\nFactor out e^{-t}:\n\n= e^{-t} [ (-2t + 2 + t^2 / 2) + 2(-1 - t^2 / 2 + t) + (1 + t^2 / 2) ]\n\nExpand the terms:\n\n= e^{-t} [ -2t + 2 + t^2 / 2 - 2 - t^2 + 2t + 1 + t^2 / 2 ]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-2t and +2t cancel out.\n\n+2 and -2 cancel out.\n\nt^2 / 2 and + t^2 / 2 is t^2.\n\n- t^2 cancels out the t^2.\n\n+1 remains.\n\nSo, it simplifies to:\n\ne^{-t} [1]\n\nWhich is e^{-t}, matching the right-hand side of the differential equation.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\nSo, the final solution to the initial value problem is:\n\ny(t) = e^{-t} (1 + t^2 / 2)\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{y(t) = e^{-t} \\left(1 + \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right)} \\]"
