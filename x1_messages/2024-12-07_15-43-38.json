So, Denali and Mount McKinley are two names for the same mountain. The name Denali is the native Alaskan name, while Mount McKinley was named after President William McKinley. In 2015, the U.S. government officially renamed the mountain back to Denali, respecting the wishes of the native Alaskans. However, some people still refer to it as Mount McKinley."
