        "content": "Alright, I need to create a Java program that works like a simple calculator. It should take two numbers and an operator from the user, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, and then show the result. Sounds straightforward. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a new Java project. I'll use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to make things easier. Once I have the project set up, I'll create a new Java class for my calculator program.\n\nNext, I need to handle command-line arguments because the program should accept inputs from the command line. In Java, command-line arguments are passed to the main method as an array of strings. So, I'll make sure my main method looks like this:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    // code here\n}\n```\n\nThe user will provide two numbers and an operator, so I'm expecting three arguments: number1, operator, number2. I need to make sure that exactly three arguments are provided; otherwise, the program should show an error message.\n\nI can check the length of the args array. If it's not equal to 3, I'll print an error message and maybe show how to use the program correctly.\n\n```java\nif (args.length != 3) {\n    System.out.println(\"Usage: java Calculator number1 operator number2\");\n    System.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\nAssuming the user provides exactly three arguments, I need to parse the first and third arguments as numbers. Since the numbers can be decimals, I'll try to parse them as doubles.\n\nI'll use `Double.parseDouble(args[0])` and `Double.parseDouble(args[2])` to convert the string arguments to double values.\n\nBut I need to handle possible exceptions if the parsing fails, like if the user enters a non-numeric value. I'll put the parsing code in a try-catch block to handle `NumberFormatException`.\n\n```java\ndouble num1;\ndouble num2;\ntry {\n    num1 = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);\n    num2 = Double.parseDouble(args[2]);\n} catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n    System.out.println(\"Invalid number format.\");\n    System.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to handle the operator, which is the second argument. The operators are +, -, *, and /. I'll use a switch statement to determine which operation to perform.\n\nBut since switch statements in Java can't directly handle string values until Java 12, and to make this compatible with older versions, I'll use if-else statements to check the operator.\n\nFirst, I'll check if the operator is \"+\", then perform addition.\n\n```java\nif (args[1].equals(\"+\")) {\n    double result = num1 + num2;\n    System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, for subtraction:\n\n```java\nelse if (args[1].equals(\"-\")) {\n    double result = num1 - num2;\n    System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n}\n```\n\nFor multiplication:\n\n```java\nelse if (args[1].equals(\"*\")) {\n    double result = num1 * num2;\n    System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n}\n```\n\nAnd for division:\n\n```java\nelse if (args[1].equals(\"/\")) {\n    if (num2 != 0) {\n        double result = num1 / num2;\n        System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n        System.exit(1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf the operator is none of the above, I'll print an error message.\n\n```java\nelse {\n    System.out.println(\"Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n    System.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\nI should also consider handling any other potential errors, like division by zero, which I've already covered in the division part.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the entire program. I'll create a class called \"Calculator\" with the main method inside it.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the program:\n\n```java\npublic class Calculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length != 3) {\n            System.out.println(\"Usage: java Calculator number1 operator number2\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n\n        double num1;\n        double num2;\n        try {\n            num1 = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);\n            num2 = Double.parseDouble(args[2]);\n        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid number format.\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n\n        if (args[1].equals(\"+\")) {\n            double result = num1 + num2;\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        } else if (args[1].equals(\"-\")) {\n            double result = num1 - num2;\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        } else if (args[1].equals(\"*\")) {\n            double result = num1 * num2;\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        } else if (args[1].equals(\"/\")) {\n            if (num2 != 0) {\n                double result = num1 / num2;\n                System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                System.exit(1);\n            }\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements. Let me test this program with some sample inputs to make sure it works correctly.\n\nFirst, test addition: `java Calculator 5 + 3`\n\nExpected output: `Result: 8.0`\n\nSecond, test subtraction: `java Calculator 10 - 4`\n\nExpected output: `Result: 6.0`\n\nThird, test multiplication: `java Calculator 2 * 4`\n\nExpected output: `Result: 8.0`\n\nFourth, test division: `java Calculator 8 / 2`\n\nExpected output: `Result: 4.0`\n\nFifth, test division by zero: `java Calculator 5 / 0`\n\nExpected output: `Error: Division by zero.`\n\nSixth, test invalid number format: `java Calculator a + 3`\n\nExpected output: `Invalid number format.`\n\nSeventh, test invalid operator: `java Calculator 5 ^ 3`\n\nExpected output: `Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.`\n\nEighth, test incorrect number of arguments: `java Calculator 5 +`\n\nExpected output: `Usage: java Calculator number1 operator number2`\n\nAll these test cases seem to be covered in the program.\n\nI might also consider adding some enhancements, like handling more operators or providing a more user-friendly interface, but for a basic calculator, this should suffice.\n\nOne thing I can improve is the output formatting. For example, if the result is a whole number, I might want to print it without the decimal part. But that's optional.\n\nAnother enhancement could be to handle more types of numbers, like integers or floats, but since I'm using doubles, it should handle most cases.\n\nI should also make sure that the program doesn't crash on any input by properly handling exceptions.\n\nI think this is a good starting point for a basic calculator program in Java.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a Java program that functions as a basic calculator, taking two numbers and an operator as command-line arguments, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check Command-Line Arguments:** Ensure exactly three arguments are provided: two numbers and one operator.\n2. **Parse Numbers:** Convert the first and third arguments to double values.\n3. **Handle Operations:** Use conditional statements to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the operator provided.\n4. **Error Handling:** Manage invalid number formats and disallow division by zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\npublic class Calculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Check if exactly three arguments are provided\n        if (args.length != 3) {\n            System.out.println(\"Usage: java Calculator number1 operator number2\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n\n        double num1;\n        double num2;\n\n        // Parse the numbers from command-line arguments\n        try {\n            num1 = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);\n            num2 = Double.parseDouble(args[2]);\n        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid number format.\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n\n        // Perform the operation based on the operator\n        if (args[1].equals(\"+\")) {\n            double result = num1 + num2;\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        } else if (args[1].equals(\"-\")) {\n            double result = num1 - num2;\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        } else if (args[1].equals(\"*\")) {\n            double result = num1 * num2;\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        } else if (args[1].equals(\"/\")) {\n            if (num2 != 0) {\n                double result = num1 / num2;\n                System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                System.exit(1);\n            }\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Argument Check:** The program first checks if exactly three command-line arguments are provided. If not, it prints usage instructions and exits.\n2. **Number Parsing:** It attempts to parse the first and third arguments as double values. If parsing fails due to invalid formats, it notifies the user and exits.\n3. **Operation Handling:** Based on the operator provided in the second argument, it performs the corresponding mathematical operation:\n   - `+` for addition\n   - `-` for subtraction\n   - `*` for multiplication\n   - `/` for division\n4. **Error Handling:** It handles division by zero by checking if the divisor is zero before performing the division and prints an error message if attempted.\n\nThis simple calculator program effectively handles basic arithmetic operations through command-line inputs, ensuring robustness with proper error handling.\n"
