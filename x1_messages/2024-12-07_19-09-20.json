        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students, and out of those, 18 students passed the exam with a grade of 70% or higher. You want to know what percentage of the class that represents.\n\nAlright, to find the percentage of students who passed, I need to divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students in the class, and then multiply that by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, the formula for percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of students who passed, which is 18, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students, which is 30.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{18}{30} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, I'll divide 18 by 30.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{30} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n\\[\n0.6 \\times 100 = 60\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, 60% of the class passed the exam with a grade of 70% or higher.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: total students = 30, passed = 18.\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage passed} = \\left( \\frac{18}{30} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction 18/30. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 6.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18 \\div 6}{30 \\div 6} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nNow,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[\n0.6 \\times 100 = 60\\%\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportions. If 18 out of 30 students passed, and I want to find out what that is as a percentage, I can set up a proportion where:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{30} = \\frac{x}{100}\n\\]\n\nThen solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n18 \\times 100 = 30 \\times x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1800 = 30x\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1800}{30} = 60\n\\]\n\nAgain, that confirms that 60% of the class passed the exam.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to realize that 30 students represent 100% of the class. So, each student represents \\(\\frac{100\\%}{30} \\approx 3.333\\%\\) of the class.\n\nThen, 18 students would represent:\n\n\\[\n18 \\times 3.333\\% \\approx 60\\%\n\\]\n\nBut this method is a bit more tedious and prone to rounding errors, so the first method is better.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 60% of the class passed the exam with a grade of 70% or higher.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
