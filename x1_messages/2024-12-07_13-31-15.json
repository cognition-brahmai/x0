So, the correct answer is B.\n\nTo elaborate, amortization is a repayment plan by which a loan is paid back in installments over a set period. Each amortized payment includes both principal and interest, and the amount paid toward principal increases with each payment, while the interest portion decreases. This process ensures that the loan is fully paid off by the end of the amortization period.\n\nFor example, if you take out a mortgage to buy a home, the amortization schedule will outline how each monthly payment is divided between principal and interest, and it will show the gradual reduction of the loan balance over time until it reaches zero at the end of the loan term.\n\nSo, to summarize, amortization in real estate finance is all about systematically paying off debt through scheduled payments."
