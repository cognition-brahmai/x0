        "content": "So there's this problem here about forming a committee with some specific conditions. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. We have a group of 8 men and 12 women, so altogether that's 20 people. We need to form a committee of 6 people, and the catch is that there must be at least 2 women in the committee.\n\nOkay, so the first thing I think about is that \"at least 2 women\" means that the committee could have 2 women, 3 women, up to all 6 being women. So, I need to find the total number of ways to form a committee with at least 2 women.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that don't meet the condition, i.e., committees with fewer than 2 women.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 6 people out of 20 without any restrictions is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of committees is \\( C(20, 6) \\).\n\nNow, committees with fewer than 2 women mean committees with 0 women or 1 woman.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of committees with 0 women, which means all 6 members are men. There are 8 men, so the number of such committees is \\( C(8, 6) \\).\n\nNext, the number of committees with 1 woman. We choose 1 woman out of 12 and 5 men out of 8. So, that's \\( C(12, 1) \\times C(8, 5) \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of committees with fewer than 2 women is \\( C(8, 6) + C(12, 1) \\times C(8, 5) \\).\n\nFinally, the number of committees with at least 2 women is the total number of committees minus the number of committees with fewer than 2 women.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of valid committees} = C(20, 6) - \\left[ C(8, 6) + C(12, 1) \\times C(8, 5) \\right]\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate each term step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( C(20, 6) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(20, 6) = \\frac{20!}{6! \\times 14!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 38760\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( C(8, 6) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(8, 6) = \\frac{8!}{6! \\times 2!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( C(12, 1) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 1) = 12\n\\]\n\nAnd \\( C(8, 5) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(8, 5) = \\frac{8!}{5! \\times 3!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( C(12, 1) \\times C(8, 5) = 12 \\times 56 = 672 \\)\n\nNow, the total number of committees with fewer than 2 women is \\( 28 + 672 = 700 \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of committees with at least 2 women is \\( 38760 - 700 = 38060 \\)\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, \\( C(20, 6) = 38760 \\), that seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( C(8, 6) = 28 \\), that's right.\n\n\\( C(12, 1) = 12 \\), obvious.\n\n\\( C(8, 5) = 56 \\), yes.\n\nSo, \\( 12 \\times 56 = 672 \\), and \\( 28 + 672 = 700 \\), then \\( 38760 - 700 = 38060 \\)\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to directly calculate the number of committees with at least 2 women by considering different cases: exactly 2 women, exactly 3 women, and so on, up to 6 women, and then summing those up.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nThe number of committees with exactly 2 women is \\( C(12, 2) \\times C(8, 4) \\)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Exactly 3 women: \\( C(12, 3) \\times C(8, 3) \\)\n\n- Exactly 4 women: \\( C(12, 4) \\times C(8, 2) \\)\n\n- Exactly 5 women: \\( C(12, 5) \\times C(8, 1) \\)\n\n- Exactly 6 women: \\( C(12, 6) \\times C(8, 0) \\)\n\nThen, sum all these up to get the total number of committees with at least 2 women.\n\nLet's calculate each term.\n\nFirst, \\( C(12, 2) \\times C(8, 4) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = 66\n\\]\n\n\\[\nC(8, 4) = \\frac{8!}{4! \\times 4!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 70\n\\]\n\n\\[\n66 \\times 70 = 4620\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( C(12, 3) \\times C(8, 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220\n\\]\n\n\\[\nC(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3! \\times 5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n\\]\n\n\\[\n220 \\times 56 = 12320\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( C(12, 4) \\times C(8, 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 4) = \\frac{12!}{4! \\times 8!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 495\n\\]\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n\\[\n495 \\times 28 = 13860\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( C(12, 5) \\times C(8, 1) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12!}{5! \\times 7!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 792\n\\]\n\n\\[\nC(8, 1) = 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n792 \\times 8 = 6336\n\\]\n\nFinally, \\( C(12, 6) \\times C(8, 0) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 6) = \\frac{12!}{6! \\times 6!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 924\n\\]\n\n\\[\nC(8, 0) = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n924 \\times 1 = 924\n\\]\n\nNow, sum all these up:\n\n\\[\n4620 + 12320 + 13860 + 6336 + 924 = 38060\n\\]\n\nHey, that's the same result as before! So, that gives me confidence that 38060 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a formula or a shorter way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but in this case, the approach we've taken is straightforward and seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total number of committees and subtract the committees that have fewer than 2 women, which is what we did first, and it gave us the same answer.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that the number of ways to form a committee of 6 people with at least 2 women from a group of 8 men and 12 women is 38060.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{38060} \\]"
