        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are 7 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 3 green balls in a bag. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball randomly. Okay, probability is basically the chances of something happening compared to all possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the bag. So, I'll add up all the balls: 7 red + 5 blue + 3 green. That totals up to 15 balls.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball. I think I can approach this by finding the total number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe favorable outcomes are picking a red or a blue ball. So, that's 7 red + 5 blue, which is 12 balls.\n\nSo, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. That would be 12 over 15.\n\nWait, but I can simplify that fraction. 12/15 simplifies to 4/5 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3.\n\nSo, the probability is 4/5.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Another way to think about it is to find the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green balls is 3, so the probability of picking a green ball is 3/15, which simplifies to 1/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball (which means picking either red or blue) is 1 minus the probability of picking green.\n\nSo, 1 - 1/5 equals 4/5.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that 4/5 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of adding the probabilities of picking a red ball and picking a blue ball.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is 7/15, and the probability of picking a blue ball is 5/15.\n\nAdding those together: 7/15 + 5/15 equals 12/15, which again simplifies to 4/5.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to the same answer, which reinforces that I'm correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red or blue ball is 4/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{5}} \\]"
