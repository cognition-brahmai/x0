        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 10 red pens, 15 black pens, and 5 blue pens. That means, in total, there are 10 + 15 + 5 = 30 pens in the box. The question is asking for the probability of picking at least one red pen when I randomly select three pens without replacement.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"at least one red pen\" means. It means that in the three pens I pick, there could be one red pen, or two, or all three could be red. So, I need to find the probability of having one or more red pens in my selection.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the probability directly by adding up the probabilities of picking exactly one red pen, exactly two red pens, and exactly three red pens. But that seems a bit tedious. There might be a simpler way.\n\nWait a minute, in probability, there's often a shortcut for finding \"at least one\" events. Instead of calculating the probability of one or more red pens directly, I can calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is picking no red pens at all, and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the probability of picking at least one red pen.\n\nSo, the complementary event is picking three pens and none of them are red. That means all three pens are either black or blue.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to pick three pens out of 30 without any restrictions. That's a combination problem, since the order doesn't matter. The number of ways to choose 3 pens out of 30 is C(30,3), which is calculated as 30 choose 3.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick three pens that are not red would be the number of ways to choose 3 pens from the non-red pens. There are 15 black pens and 5 blue pens, making a total of 20 non-red pens. So, the number of ways to choose 3 non-red pens is C(20,3).\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking no red pens is C(20,3) divided by C(30,3).\n\nThen, the probability of picking at least one red pen would be 1 minus that probability.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(at least one red) = 1 - P(no red pens)\n\nP(no red pens) = C(20,3) / C(30,3)\n\nSo, P(at least one red) = 1 - [C(20,3)/C(30,3)]\n\nNow, I need to calculate C(20,3) and C(30,3).\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFirst, C(20,3) = 20! / (3! * 17!) = (20*19*18)/(3*2*1) = (20*19*18)/6\n\nLet's calculate that: 20*19 = 380, 380*18 = 6840, and 6840 divided by 6 is 1140.\n\nSo, C(20,3) = 1140.\n\nNext, C(30,3) = 30! / (3! * 27!) = (30*29*28)/(3*2*1) = (30*29*28)/6\n\nCalculate that: 30*29 = 870, 870*28 = 24,360, and 24,360 divided by 6 is 4,060.\n\nSo, C(30,3) = 4,060.\n\nNow, P(no red pens) = 1140 / 4060.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 20.\n\n1140 \u00f7 20 = 57\n\n4060 \u00f7 20 = 203\n\nSo, 1140/4060 = 57/203.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one red) = 1 - (57/203) = (203 - 57)/203 = 146/203.\n\nWait a second, can I simplify 146/203 further? Let's see if 146 and 203 have any common factors.\n\n146 divided by 2 is 73, and 203 divided by 7 is approximately 29. Let's check if 203 is divisible by 7: 7*29 = 203, yes.\n\nSo, 203 = 7*29.\n\nSimilarly, 146 divided by 2 is 73, and 73 is a prime number.\n\nSo, 146 = 2*73, and 203 = 7*29.\n\nThere are no common factors between 146 and 203, so 146/203 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking at least one red pen is 146/203.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a better sense of it.\n\n146 divided by 203 is approximately 0.7192.\n\nSo, roughly 71.92%.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider another approach to confirm this answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the probability of picking at least one red pen directly, which would be the sum of the probabilities of picking exactly one red pen, exactly two red pens, and exactly three red pens.\n\nLet's calculate that and see if it matches my previous result.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking exactly one red pen.\n\nTo pick exactly one red pen out of three, I need to choose one red pen and two non-red pens.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red pen is C(10,1) = 10.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two non-red pens is C(20,2).\n\nC(20,2) = (20*19)/(2*1) = 190.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly one red pen is 10 * 190 = 1,900.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of ways to choose three pens is C(30,3) = 4,060.\n\nTherefore, P(exactly one red) = 1,900 / 4,060.\n\nSimilarly, for exactly two red pens:\n\nNumber of ways to choose two red pens is C(10,2) = (10*9)/2 = 45.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one non-red pen is C(20,1) = 20.\n\nSo, number of favorable outcomes for exactly two red pens is 45 * 20 = 900.\n\nTherefore, P(exactly two red) = 900 / 4,060.\n\nAnd for exactly three red pens:\n\nNumber of ways to choose three red pens is C(10,3) = (10*9*8)/(3*2*1) = 120.\n\nNumber of ways to choose zero non-red pens is C(20,0) = 1.\n\nSo, number of favorable outcomes for exactly three red pens is 120 * 1 = 120.\n\nTherefore, P(exactly three red) = 120 / 4,060.\n\nNow, P(at least one red) = P(one red) + P(two red) + P(three red) = (1,900 + 900 + 120) / 4,060 = 2,920 / 4,060.\n\nSimplify 2,920 / 4,060.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 20.\n\n2,920 \u00f7 20 = 146\n\n4,060 \u00f7 20 = 203\n\nSo, 2,920 / 4,060 = 146 / 203.\n\nWhich matches my previous result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 146/203.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to, I could calculate the probability step by step using conditional probabilities, considering that the picks are without replacement.\n\nSo, the first pick: probability of picking a red pen is 10/30.\n\nIf I pick a red pen first, then for the second pick, there are 9 red pens left and 29 pens in total.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't pick a red pen first, the probabilities adjust accordingly.\n\nBut this seems more complicated than the combination approach I used earlier, and it's prone to errors if not handled carefully.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the combination approach.\n\nJust to verify the decimal approximation:\n\n146 divided by 203 is approximately 0.7192, which is about 71.92%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 71.92% chance of picking at least one red pen when selecting three pens without replacement from the box.\n\nThat makes sense because there are more non-red pens, but still a significant number of red pens, so the probability is substantial.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the probability of not picking any red pens, which is 1140 / 4060 = 57 / 203, which is approximately 0.2808, or 28.08%, which indeed adds up to 100% when added to the previous probability.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, to summarize, the probability of picking at least one red pen is 146/203, or approximately 71.92%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of picking at least one red pen is \\boxed{\\dfrac{146}{203}}."
