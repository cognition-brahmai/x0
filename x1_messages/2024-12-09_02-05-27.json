First, we need to find out how many students received an A grade and how many received a B grade.\n\nThe class has 30 students in total, and 40% of them received an A grade. So, to find the number of A students, we calculate 40% of 30:\n\nNumber of A students = 40% of 30 = (40/100) * 30 = 0.4 * 30 = 12 students\n\nNow, the rest of the students received a B grade. Since there are 30 students in total and 12 of them got an A, the number of B students is:\n\nNumber of B students = Total students - Number of A students = 30 - 12 = 18 students\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total reward money given to A students and B students separately and then sum them up.\n\nEach A student receives a $10 reward, so the total reward for A students is:\n\nTotal A reward = Number of A students * $10 = 12 * $10 = $120\n\nEach B student receives a $5 reward, so the total reward for B students is:\n\nTotal B reward = Number of B students * $5 = 18 * $5 = $90\n\nFinally, the total amount of money given as rewards is the sum of the A and B rewards:\n\nTotal reward = Total A reward + Total B reward = $120 + $90 = $210\n\nSo, the total amount of money given as rewards is $210.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]"
