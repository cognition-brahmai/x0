        "content": "Let's see. I know that in any triangle, the sum of all the interior angles is always 180 degrees. So, if I have two angles measured at 35 degrees and 75 degrees, I can find the third angle by subtracting the sum of these two angles from 180 degrees.\n\nFirst, I'll add the two given angles:\n\n35 degrees + 75 degrees = 110 degrees\n\nNow, I'll subtract this sum from 180 degrees to find the third angle:\n\n180 degrees - 110 degrees = 70 degrees\n\nSo, the measure of the third angle is 70 degrees.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using the properties of triangles or some formula I've forgotten.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the fact that in a triangle, the largest angle is opposite the largest side, but I don't have any information about the sides here. So, maybe that's not helpful right now.\n\nOr, maybe I can consider that this could be a right-angled triangle, but 35 and 75 don't add up to 90, so that doesn't seem likely. Unless there's another angle involved, but the question only mentions two angles.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider if there's a possibility that one of the angles is exterior, but the question specifies that they are both interior angles of the triangle.\n\nLet me make sure about the basic property: the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. I think that's a fundamental geometric fact.\n\nSo, if I have two angles, 35 and 75 degrees, their sum is 110 degrees. Subtracting from 180 gives 70 degrees.\n\nIs there any chance that the triangle could be obtuse, with one angle greater than 90 degrees? Well, 75 degrees is less than 90, and 35 is less than 90, so the third angle must be less than 90 degrees as well, since 180 minus 110 is 70, which is less than 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the sine or cosine rules, but that seems overkill for this problem, and I don't have any side lengths to work with.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider drawing the triangle and measuring the angles, but that's not practical in this scenario.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral, but with angles of 35 and 75 degrees, it can't be equilateral, since all angles in an equilateral triangle are 60 degrees. And for it to be isosceles, two angles would need to be equal, but here we have two different angles, so unless the third angle is equal to one of these, it might not be isosceles.\n\nWait, let's check if the third angle could be 35 degrees or 75 degrees.\n\nIf the third angle were 35 degrees, then the sum would be 35 + 35 + 75 = 145 degrees, which is less than 180 degrees.\n\nIf the third angle were 75 degrees, then the sum would be 35 + 75 + 75 = 185 degrees, which is more than 180 degrees.\n\nNeither of those works, so the third angle must be different from the first two.\n\nBack to the original approach: 180 - (35 + 75) = 70 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the difference between the two given angles. 75 degrees minus 35 degrees is 40 degrees. But I don't see how that directly helps me find the third angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of the angles, but again, that doesn't seem directly relevant here.\n\nI think the simplest and most straightforward way is to use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees and subtract the sum of the two given angles from 180 to find the third angle.\n\nSo, third angle = 180 - (35 + 75) = 180 - 110 = 70 degrees.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70^\\circ} \\]"
