        "content": "So I have this group G presented as <a, b | a^3 = b^2 = 1, ab = ba>. I need to find its order. Let's see what this means.\n\nFirst, the presentation tells me that G is generated by two elements, a and b, with some relations between them. The relations are a^3 = 1, which means a has order 3; b^2 = 1, so b has order 2; and ab = ba, which means a and b commute.\n\nSince a and b commute, G is an abelian group. That simplifies things because in an abelian group, the order of elements and their products behave nicely.\n\nSo, G is generated by a and b, with a of order 3 and b of order 2, and they commute.\n\nI recall that if I have two elements in a group that commute and have finite orders, then the order of their product is the least common multiple of their orders, provided that the orders are coprime.\n\nWait, but in this case, the orders are 3 and 2, which are coprime since gcd(3,2) = 1. So, the order of ab should be lcm(3,2) = 6.\n\nBut hold on, is that the order of the entire group G, or just the order of the element ab?\n\nI think I need to be careful here. The group G is generated by a and b, so every element in G can be written as a product of powers of a and b, considering the relations.\n\nGiven that a and b commute, any element in G can be written in the form a^m b^n, where m and n are integers.\n\nBut since a has order 3, a^3 = 1, so a^m is the same as a^{m mod 3}. Similarly, b has order 2, so b^n = b^{n mod 2}.\n\nTherefore, every element in G can be written as a^m b^n, where m is 0, 1, or 2, and n is 0 or 1.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. a^0 b^0 = 1\n\n2. a^0 b^1 = b\n\n3. a^1 b^0 = a\n\n4. a^1 b^1 = ab\n\n5. a^2 b^0 = a^2\n\n6. a^2 b^1 = a^2 b\n\nSo, there are 6 distinct elements in G: 1, b, a, ab, a^2, a^2 b.\n\nTherefore, the order of G is 6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the order of ab is 6, but now I see that there are 6 distinct elements in G. Is that a coincidence, or is there a connection?\n\nLet me check the orders of these elements:\n\n- 1 has order 1.\n\n- b has order 2, since b^2 = 1.\n\n- a has order 3, since a^3 = 1.\n\n- ab: let's compute (ab)^2 = abab, since ab = ba.\n\nSo, abab = a(ba)b = a(ab)b = a^2 b^2 = a^2 * 1 = a^2.\n\nThen, (ab)^3 = (ab)(ab)(ab) = (ab)(a^2) = a b a^2 = a a^2 b = a^3 b = 1 * b = b.\n\nAnd (ab)^4 = (ab)^3 (ab) = b(ab) = bab = a b^2 = a * 1 = a.\n\n(ab)^5 = (ab)^4 (ab) = a(ab) = a^2 b.\n\n(ab)^6 = (ab)^5 (ab) = a^2 b (ab) = a^2 b a b = a^2 (ba) b = a^2 (ab) b = a^3 b^2 = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSo, (ab)^6 = 1, and no smaller positive power of ab equals 1, so the order of ab is indeed 6.\n\nSimilarly, a^2 b: let's compute (a^2 b)^2 = a^2 b a^2 b = a^2 (ba^2) b = a^2 (a^2 b) b = a^4 b^2 = a * 1 = a.\n\n(a^2 b)^3 = (a^2 b)^2 (a^2 b) = a (a^2 b) = a^3 b = 1 * b = b.\n\n(a^2 b)^4 = (a^2 b)^3 (a^2 b) = b (a^2 b) = ba^2 b^2 = a^2 b^3 = a^2 b.\n\n(a^2 b)^5 = (a^2 b)^4 (a^2 b) = a^2 b (a^2 b) = a^2 (ba^2) b = a^2 (a^2 b) b = a^4 b^2 = a * 1 = a.\n\n(a^2 b)^6 = (a^2 b)^5 (a^2 b) = a (a^2 b) = a^3 b = 1 * b = b.\n\nWait, this seems to be cycling through a, b, a^2 b, etc., but not reaching 1 yet.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake in computing (a^2 b)^2.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n(a^2 b)^2 = a^2 b a^2 b.\n\nSince ab = ba, then ba = ab.\n\nSo, a^2 b a^2 b = a^2 (ba^2) b = a^2 (a^2 b) b = a^4 b^2 = (a^3)(a) (1) = (1)(a)(1) = a.\n\nThen, (a^2 b)^3 = (a^2 b)^2 (a^2 b) = a (a^2 b) = a^3 b = 1 * b = b.\n\n(a^2 b)^4 = (a^2 b)^3 (a^2 b) = b (a^2 b) = ba^2 b = a^2 b^2 = a^2 * 1 = a^2.\n\n(a^2 b)^5 = (a^2 b)^4 (a^2 b) = a^2 (a^2 b) = a^4 b = a * b = ab.\n\n(a^2 b)^6 = (a^2 b)^5 (a^2 b) = ab (a^2 b) = a b a^2 b = a (ba^2) b = a (a^2 b) b = a^3 b^2 = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSo, (a^2 b)^6 = 1, and no smaller positive power of a^2 b equals 1, so the order of a^2 b is also 6.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the order of a^2:\n\n(a^2)^1 = a^2.\n\n(a^2)^2 = a^4 = a.\n\n(a^2)^3 = a^6 = (a^3)^2 = 1^2 = 1.\n\nSo, the order of a^2 is 3.\n\nAnd the order of a is already 3.\n\nAnd b has order 2.\n\nAnd ab has order 6, as we saw.\n\nAnd a^2 b has order 6.\n\nSo, in this group G of order 6, we have elements of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nThis looks like the cyclic group of order 6, C6, which has elements of orders dividing 6.\n\nAlternatively, it could be the symmetric group S3, which also has order 6, but in S3, the elements have orders 1, 2, and 3 only.\n\nWait, but in G, we have elements of order 6, specifically ab and a^2 b.\n\nIn S3, there are no elements of order 6, since the maximum order of any element in S3 is 3 (the 3-cycles).\n\nTherefore, G cannot be isomorphic to S3.\n\nHence, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nTherefore, G is an abelian group of order 6, generated by an element of order 6, namely ab or a^2 b.\n\nSo, the order of G is 6.\n\nAlternatively, since G is generated by a and b, with a of order 3, b of order 2, and ab = ba, we can think of G as the direct product of the cyclic groups generated by a and b, that is, G \u2245 C3 \u00d7 C2.\n\nBut C3 \u00d7 C2 is isomorphic to C6, since 3 and 2 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to C6, and thus has order 6.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of the exponents.\n\nSince a and b commute, any element in G can be written as a^m b^n, with m=0,1,2 and n=0,1.\n\nThus, there are 3 choices for m and 2 choices for n, giving 3*2=6 elements in G.\n\nHence, the order of G is 6.\n\nI think this is sufficient to conclude that the order of G is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
