Dionysus is often depicted holding a thyrsus, a staff entwined with grapevines and leaves, and he is frequently accompanied by panthers or leopards, which symbolize his wild and untamed nature. He is also associated with maenads, female followers who would participate in ecstatic rituals in his honor."
