        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about bacteria doubling every 3 hours. Starting with 1,000 bacteria, and I need to find out how many there will be after 24 hours. Hmm, okay, so first, I need to understand what it means for the bacteria to double every 3 hours.\n\nSo, doubling means the amount multiplied by 2, right? So every 3 hours, the population becomes twice what it was before. So, if I start with 1,000, after 3 hours, it's 2,000. Then after another 3 hours, it's 4,000, and so on.\n\nBut, 24 hours is a whole day, and 3 hours is the doubling period. I need to find out how many doubling periods there are in 24 hours. So, 24 divided by 3 should give me the number of times the bacteria double.\n\nLet me calculate that: 24 \u00f7 3 = 8. So, there are 8 doubling periods in 24 hours.\n\nNow, if the population doubles 8 times, starting from 1,000, how do I calculate the final amount? I think I can use the formula for exponential growth: N = N\u2080 \u00d7 2^n, where N is the final amount, N\u2080 is the initial amount, and n is the number of doubling periods.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: N = 1,000 \u00d7 2^8.\n\nWait, but 2^8 is 256. So, 1,000 \u00d7 256 = 256,000.\n\nIs that right? It seems like a lot, but I think it makes sense because the bacteria are doubling every 3 hours, and over 24 hours, that's 8 doublings, which would be a significant increase.\n\nLet me double-check the formula. Exponential growth for doubling is indeed N = N\u2080 \u00d7 2^n. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it step by step. Starting with 1,000:\n\n- After 3 hours: 1,000 \u00d7 2 = 2,000\n\n- After 6 hours: 2,000 \u00d7 2 = 4,000\n\n- After 9 hours: 4,000 \u00d7 2 = 8,000\n\n- After 12 hours: 8,000 \u00d7 2 = 16,000\n\n- After 15 hours: 16,000 \u00d7 2 = 32,000\n\n- After 18 hours: 32,000 \u00d7 2 = 64,000\n\n- After 21 hours: 64,000 \u00d7 2 = 128,000\n\n- After 24 hours: 128,000 \u00d7 2 = 256,000\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, after 24 hours, there should be 256,000 bacteria.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there any other factor to consider? Like, maybe the growth rate changes over time, or perhaps the petri dish can't support that many bacteria. But the problem doesn't mention any limitations, so I think it's safe to assume unlimited growth in this scenario.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The time is in hours, and the doubling period is also in hours, so that's good.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the exponential growth formula with continuous growth, like N = N\u2080 \u00d7 e^(kt), where k is the growth rate.\n\nBut in this case, since it's doubling every 3 hours, using N = N\u2080 \u00d7 2^(t/T), where T is the doubling time, might be more appropriate.\n\nSo, N = 1,000 \u00d7 2^(24/3) = 1,000 \u00d7 2^8 = 1,000 \u00d7 256 = 256,000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. So, after 24 hours, there will be 256,000 bacteria in the petri dish.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{256000} \\]"
