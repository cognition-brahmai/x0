        "content": "In the woods, where the trees stand tall,\nAmidst the rustle of leaves so small,\nA path winds through, unknown and deep,\nWhere secrets lie, in shadows kept.\n\nAmidst the rustle of leaves so small,\nThe whispers of ancient trees enthrall,\nWhere secrets lie, in shadows kept,\nAnd time seems still, in nature's grasp.\n\nThe whispers of ancient trees enthrall,\nTheir roots entwine, a silent call,\nAnd time seems still, in nature's grasp,\nWhile seasons change, in cycles vast.\n\nTheir roots entwine, a silent call,\nTo those who listen, one and all,\nWhile seasons change, in cycles vast,\nThe forest stands, a timeless tale.\n\nTo those who listen, one and all,\nIts stories woven, tall and small,\nThe forest stands, a timeless tale,\nBeneath the sky, where eagles sail.\n\nIts stories woven, tall and small,\nThrough storms and calm, it withstood all,\nBeneath the sky, where eagles sail,\nIn the woods, where the trees stand tall.\n\nNote: A pantoum is a type of poem in which pairs of lines are repeated in a specific pattern, creating a chain-like structure. In this pantoum, the second line of each stanza is repeated as the first line of the next stanza, and the last stanza's second line repeats the first stanza's first line, completing the cycle. This form was originally from Malaysia but became popular in French literature, and poets like Robert Frost have experimented with it in English."
