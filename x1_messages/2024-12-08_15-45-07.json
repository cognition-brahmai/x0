        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 12 red balls and 8 blue balls. So, total balls in the box are 12 plus 8, which is 20 balls.\n\nNow, the question is: if you pick 2 balls randomly from the box without replacement, what's the probability that both balls are red?\n\nOkay, so without replacement means that once you pick the first ball, you don't put it back before picking the second ball. That changes things because the probabilities change after the first pick.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability that the first ball picked is red. Since there are 12 red balls out of 20 total balls, the probability is 12/20. Simplifying that, it's 3/5.\n\nNow, given that the first ball was red, there are now 11 red balls left and a total of 19 balls left in the box. So, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is 11/19.\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen\u2014both balls are red\u2014I need to multiply these two probabilities together. So, it's (3/5) times (11/19).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 3/5 multiplied by 11/19.\n\nMultiply numerator by numerator: 3 times 11 is 33.\n\nDenominator by denominator: 5 times 19 is 95.\n\nSo, the probability is 33/95.\n\nLet me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, I could think about combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 20 is \u201c20 choose 2,\u201d which is calculated as 20 times 19 divided by 2, which is 190.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 12 is \u201c12 choose 2,\u201d which is 12 times 11 divided by 2, which is 66.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of outcomes, which is 66/190.\n\nSimplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 2, get 33/95.\n\nSo, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlright, so the probability is 33/95.\n\nWait a second, is there another way to think about this to confirm?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of picking two red balls in a row without replacement.\n\nProbability first ball red is 12/20, which is 3/5.\n\nThen, given the first was red, probability second is red is 11/19.\n\nMultiplying them gives 33/95.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability that the first ball is red and the second is not red, and so on, but that\u2019s not necessary since the direct approach gives a clear answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total probability and see if that makes sense.\n\nTotal probability of any two balls being picked is 1, of course.\n\nProbability both red is 33/95.\n\nProbability one red and one blue, or both blue.\n\nBut I don't need to calculate those for this problem.\n\nSo, I think 33/95 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me check if 33 and 95 have any common factors.\n\n33 is 3 times 11, and 95 is 5 times 19. No common factors, so it's already in simplest form.\n\nYes,\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c33/95 \u662f\u6700\u7b80\u5206\u6570\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f 33/95\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{95}} \\]"
