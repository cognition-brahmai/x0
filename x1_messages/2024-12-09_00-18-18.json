        "content": "Yes, carrots can help improve night vision even for people who already have adequate levels of vitamin A. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which is converted into vitamin A in the body. Vitamin A is essential for maintaining good vision, especially in low-light conditions. Consuming carrots regularly can support overall eye health and potentially enhance night vision."
