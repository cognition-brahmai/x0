        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a disease with a prevalence of 0.01, which means that 1% of the population has it. The test for this disease has a sensitivity and specificity of 95%, meaning it correctly identifies 95% of the people who have the disease and 95% of the people who don't have the disease.\n\nWe need to find the probability that someone has the disease given that they tested positive. This sounds like a job for Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, let's recall Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n\nIn this context:\n\n- \\( A \\) is having the disease.\n\n- \\( B \\) is testing positive.\n\nSo, \\( P(A|B) \\) is what we're looking for: the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n\nWe know:\n\n- \\( P(A) = 0.01 \\) (prevalence).\n\n- \\( P(B|A) = 0.95 \\) (sensitivity).\n\nWe also know the specificity is 95%, which is \\( P(\\text{negative test}|\\text{no disease}) = 0.95 \\). Therefore, the probability of a false positive is \\( 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 \\), which is \\( P(B|\\text{no disease}) = 0.05 \\).\n\nNow, to apply Bayes' theorem, we need \\( P(B) \\), the total probability of testing positive. We can find this using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|\\text{no disease}) \\cdot P(\\text{no disease}) \\]\n\nWe already have \\( P(A) = 0.01 \\), so \\( P(\\text{no disease}) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(B) = (0.95 \\times 0.01) + (0.05 \\times 0.99) \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ P(B) = (0.0095) + (0.0495) = 0.059 \\]\n\nNow, plug everything back into Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.01}{0.059} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.059} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) \\approx 0.161 \\]\n\nSo, the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is approximately 16.1%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems surprisingly low. I would expect it to be higher given the high sensitivity and specificity. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- Prevalence, \\( P(A) = 0.01 \\).\n\n- Sensitivity, \\( P(B|A) = 0.95 \\).\n\n- Specificity, \\( P(\\text{negative test}|\\text{no disease}) = 0.95 \\), so false positive rate, \\( P(B|\\text{no disease}) = 0.05 \\).\n\n- \\( P(\\text{no disease}) = 0.99 \\).\n\nTotal probability of testing positive:\n\n\\[ P(B) = (0.95 \\times 0.01) + (0.05 \\times 0.99) = 0.0095 + 0.0495 = 0.059 \\]\n\nNow, applying Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.01}{0.059} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.059} \\approx 0.161 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, even with a positive test result from a test that's 95% sensitive and specific, the probability of having the disease is only about 16.1% due to the low prevalence.\n\nI guess this is a classic example of how prior probabilities affect posterior probabilities in Bayes' theorem. It makes sense because even though the test is pretty accurate, the disease is rare, so there are more false positives than true positives.\n\nLet me try to verify this with different approach, maybe using a contingency table or something similar.\n\nSuppose we have a population of 10,000 people.\n\n- Number with the disease: \\( 10,000 \\times 0.01 = 100 \\).\n\n- Number without the disease: \\( 10,000 - 100 = 9,900 \\).\n\nNow, applying the test:\n\n- True positives: \\( 100 \\times 0.95 = 95 \\).\n\n- False negatives: \\( 100 - 95 = 5 \\).\n\n- False positives: \\( 9,900 \\times 0.05 = 495 \\).\n\n- True negatives: \\( 9,900 - 495 = 9,405 \\).\n\nNow, the total number of positive test results is true positives plus false positives:\n\n\\[ 95 + 495 = 590 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of having the disease given a positive test is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{95}{590} \\approx 0.161 \\]\n\nSame result as before. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for positive predictive value (PPV), which is exactly what we're calculating here:\n\n\\[ PPV = \\frac{\\text{true positives}}{\\text{true positives} + \\text{false positives}} \\]\n\nWhich is what I did in the contingency table approach.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is approximately 16.1%.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we should account for. Is there any possibility of dependency between the test accuracy and the prevalence, or anything like that?\n\nIn this case, the test's sensitivity and specificity are given as conditional probabilities based on whether the person has the disease or not, and they are assumed to be independent of prevalence. So, I think our calculation is solid.\n\nMoreover, Bayes' theorem is specifically designed for these kinds of problems, where we have prior probabilities and conditional probabilities, and we need to find the reverse conditional probability.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that even though the test is pretty accurate, the disease is rare, so the number of false positives outweighs the number of true positives in this scenario.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is approximately 16.1%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.161} \\]"
