It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how quicksort works:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot**: This can be any element in the array. Common choices are the first element, the last element, or the middle element. For simplicity, we'll choose the last element as the pivot.\n\n2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final sorted position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays**: Apply the same process to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n\nNow, let's implement this in JavaScript.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement the quicksort algorithm in JavaScript, we need to define a function that sorts an array of numbers using the divide-and-conquer approach. Here's the implementation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction quicksort(arr, left = 0, right = arr.length - 1) {\n    if (left < right) {\n        const pivotIndex = partition(arr, left, right);\n        quicksort(arr, left, pivotIndex - 1);\n        quicksort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, right);\n    }\n    return arr;\n}\n\nfunction partition(arr, left, right) {\n    const pivot = arr[right];\n    let i = left - 1;\n    for (let j = left; j < right; j++) {\n        if (arr[j] < pivot) {\n            i++;\n            [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];\n        }\n    }\n    [arr[i + 1], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[i + 1]];\n    return i + 1;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Quicksort Function**:\n    - This is the main function that implements the quicksort algorithm.\n    - It takes an array `arr` and optional `left` and `right` indices to specify the portion of the array to be sorted.\n    - If `left < right`, it means there are more than one elements to sort.\n    - It calls the `partition` function to find the pivot index.\n    - It recursively calls itself for the sub-array before the pivot and the sub-array after the pivot.\n\n2. **Partition Function**:\n    - This function is responsible for partitioning the array around a pivot.\n    - It selects the last element as the pivot.\n    - It rearranges the array so that all elements less than the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right.\n    - It returns the index of the pivot after partitioning.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use the `quicksort` function, simply pass an array of numbers:\n\n```javascript\nconst array = [3,6,8,10,1,2,1];\nconsole.log(quicksort(array)); // Output: [1,1,2,3,6,8,10]\n```\n\nThis implementation is efficient and works well for sorting arrays of numbers using the quicksort algorithm."
