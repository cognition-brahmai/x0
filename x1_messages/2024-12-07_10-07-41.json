        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangle that's originally 10 meters long and 6 meters wide. Then, both the length and the width are doubled. I need to find out what the ratio of the area of the new rectangle is compared to the original one.\n\nAlright, first things first. I need to remember how to calculate the area of a rectangle. I think it's just length times width, right? So, for the original rectangle, the area should be 10 meters times 6 meters, which is 60 square meters.\n\nNow, if both the length and the width are doubled, that means the new length is 2 times 10 meters, which is 20 meters, and the new width is 2 times 6 meters, which is 12 meters.\n\nSo, the area of the new rectangle would be 20 meters times 12 meters. Let's see, 20 times 12 is 240 square meters.\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of the new area to the original area. So, that would be the new area divided by the original area. That is 240 square meters divided by 60 square meters.\n\n240 divided by 60 is 4. So, the ratio is 4:1.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to think about this without plugging in the numbers right away? Like, maybe using variables?\n\nLet's try that. Let\u2019s say the original length is L and the original width is W. So, the original area is L times W.\n\nThen, the new length is 2L and the new width is 2W, so the new area is 2L times 2W, which is 4LW.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the new area to the original area is 4LW divided by LW, which simplifies to 4.\n\nSo, no matter what the original lengths are, if you double both the length and the width, the area becomes four times the original area.\n\nThat makes sense because area is two-dimensional, so when you scale both dimensions by a factor, the area scales by the square of that factor. In this case, the scale factor is 2, so the area increases by a factor of 4.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions or something?\n\nWell, the original rectangle has sides in the ratio of L:W, which is 10:6, or simplified, 5:3.\n\nBut I don't think that's relevant for finding the area ratio when both dimensions are scaled equally.\n\nWait, but in this specific case, since both dimensions are scaled by the same factor, the shape remains similar, just larger.\n\nBut again, for the area ratio, it's just the square of the scale factor.\n\nSo, scale factor is 2, area ratio is 2 squared, which is 4.\n\nI think that's the most straightforward way to think about it.\n\nLet me check if there's any other aspect to this.\n\nIs there a possibility that the ratio could be different if the dimensions were scaled differently?\n\nWell, in this problem, both dimensions are scaled by the same factor of 2.\n\nBut just out of curiosity, if only one dimension was doubled, what would happen to the area?\n\nLet's say only the length is doubled, to 20 meters, and the width remains 6 meters.\n\nThen, the new area would be 20 times 6, which is 120 square meters.\n\nSo, the ratio would be 120 divided by 60, which is 2:1.\n\nBut that's not the case here, since both dimensions are doubled.\n\nAlternatively, if only the width was doubled, to 12 meters, and the length remains 10 meters, the new area would be 10 times 12, which is 120 square meters again, leading to the same ratio of 2:1.\n\nBut again, in this problem, both are doubled, leading to a 4:1 ratio.\n\nI think I've confirmed that the ratio is indeed 4:1.\n\nMaybe I can think about this in terms of units.\n\nOriginal area is 10m * 6m = 60 m\u00b2.\n\nNew area is 20m * 12m = 240 m\u00b2.\n\nRatio is 240 m\u00b2 : 60 m\u00b2, which simplifies to 4:1.\n\nAlternatively, 240 divided by 60 is 4.\n\nSo, the new area is 4 times the original area.\n\nI could also consider that doubling each dimension multiplies the area by 2*2=4.\n\nWait, actually, that's the same as saying the area scales with the square of the scale factor.\n\nScale factor is 2, area scale factor is 2\u00b2=4.\n\nThis is a general principle: for similar shapes, the area scales with the square of the linear scale factor.\n\nSimilarly, for three-dimensional shapes, volume scales with the cube of the linear scale factor.\n\nBut since this is a two-dimensional problem, we're dealing with area and the square of the scale factor.\n\nI think I've thoroughly convinced myself that the ratio is 4:1.\n\nIs there any chance that it could be something else?\n\nWell, perhaps if the rectangle was transformed in some other way, but according to the problem, only the length and width are doubled, and nothing else is changed.\n\nSo, no, the ratio should definitely be 4:1.\n\nI don't see any room for misunderstanding here.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the area of the new rectangle is 4 times the area of the original rectangle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
