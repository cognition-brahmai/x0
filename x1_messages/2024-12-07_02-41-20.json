        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 4 classes, and each class has 20 students. That means there are a total of 4 classes times 20 students per class, which gives us 80 students in total.\n\nNow, each student has 5 subjects, and for each subject, they need one book. So, for one student, that's 5 books. Since there are 80 students, we'll need to multiply the number of students by the number of books per student to find the total number of books needed.\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nFirst, find the total number of students:\n\n4 classes \u00d7 20 students/class = 80 students\n\nNext, find the total number of books:\n\n80 students \u00d7 5 books/student = 400 books\n\nSo, the school needs 400 books in total for all the students.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe by considering the number of books per class.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nEach class has 20 students, and each student has 5 books. So, for one class, the number of books needed is:\n\n20 students \u00d7 5 books/student = 100 books per class\n\nSince there are 4 classes, the total number of books would be:\n\n4 classes \u00d7 100 books/class = 400 books\n\nThat matches our earlier calculation, which is a good sign. It looks like 400 is the correct total number of books needed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or if some books are shared among students. The problem says that each student has 5 subjects and each subject has one book, implying that each student needs their own set of 5 books. There's no mention of shared books, so we can safely assume that each student needs their own 5 books.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that each subject has one book, so there are no additional materials or multiple books per subject.\n\nTherefore, the total number of books needed is indeed 400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
