As the pressure drops, cows may feel discomfort or unease, causing them to lie down to alleviate any pressure on their bodies. Additionally, lying down may help them conserve energy in anticipation of adverse weather conditions. So, if you see cows lying down in a field, it could be an indication that rain is on the way."
