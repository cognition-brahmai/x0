This tool is helpful in locating a suitable list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's query. It does not directly answer the question but finds a list of sites that might have the answer.\nTextScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nKnowledgeModel[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what their most famous work is. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020. I can probably find that through a quick search. I'll use DuckDuckGo for this because it's a good search engine.\n\nSo, my first plan is to search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\" using DuckDuckGo. That should give me a list of websites that have the information I need.\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to look through those websites to find the name of the winner. It's possible that the top results will have the answer directly, but I should check a few sources to make sure it's accurate.\n\nAfter I have the name of the winner, my next step is to find out their most famous work. For this, I can either search for \"[Winner's Name] most famous work\" or look for a biography that mentions their notable works.\n\nI might need to scrape some text from websites to get this information, so I can use the TextScraper tool to extract the content from relevant pages.\n\nAlternatively, once I have the name of the winner, I can feed that information into the KnowledgeModel and ask it directly, like \"Who is the Nobel Prize in Literature winner in 2020, and what is their most famous work?\" but I'm not sure how well the KnowledgeModel handles specific queries like this without context. Maybe it's better to use it after I have gathered some information.\n\nLet me think about this again. Maybe I can search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner and their most famous work\" in DuckDuckGo. That way, I might find a website that has both pieces of information.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should probably find the official Nobel Prize website or a reliable news source that announces the winners and their notable works.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1. Use DuckDuckGo to search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\".\n\n2. From the search results, extract the links to potential sources like the official Nobel Prize website, Reuters, BBC, etc.\n\n3. Use TextScraper to extract text from these websites.\n\n4. Look for the name of the winner in the extracted text.\n\n5. Once I have the winner's name, search for \"[Winner's Name] most famous work\" using DuckDuckGo.\n\n6. Extract links from this second search and use TextScraper again to get the text.\n\n7. Look for information about the most famous work in the extracted text.\n\n8. Finally, use the KnowledgeModel to summarize the information and confirm the answers.\n\nBut this seems a bit lengthy. Maybe I can combine some steps.\n\nAlternatively, after finding the winner's name, I can feed the name along with the question to the KnowledgeModel, like \"Who is the Nobel Prize in Literature winner in 2020, and what is their most famous work?\" and see if it can provide the answer directly.\n\nBut I'm not sure how well the KnowledgeModel handles specific queries without additional context. It might be better to provide it with some context from the websites I've scraped.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is:\n\n1. Search for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\" using DuckDuckGo.\n\n2. Extract the links from the search results.\n\n3. Use TextScraper to extract text from these links.\n\n4. Use HyperlinkExtractor to find more relevant links within the extracted text, if necessary.\n\n5. Use KnowledgeModel with the extracted text as context to answer \"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?\"\n\nThis way, the KnowledgeModel has access to the information from the websites and can provide a more accurate answer.\n\nBut perhaps I should specify which evidence to use in the KnowledgeModel. For example:\n\nPlan: Search for the Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.\n\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\nPlan: Extract links from the search results.\n\n:evidence1: = HyperlinkExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Scrape text from the extracted links.\n\n:evidence2: = TextScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Use KnowledgeModel to answer the question based on the scraped text.\n\n:evidence3: = KnowledgeModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given context: :evidence2:\"]\n\nAnswer: :evidence3:\n\nThis seems like a systematic approach. Let's write it out clearly.\n\nPlan: Search for the Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.\n\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\nPlan: Extract links from the search results.\n\n:evidence1: = HyperlinkExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Scrape text from the extracted links.\n\n:evidence2: = TextScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Use KnowledgeModel to answer the question based on the scraped text.\n\n:evidence3: = KnowledgeModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given context: :evidence2:\"]\n\nAnswer: :evidence3:\n\nThis should give me the information I need in a structured way.\n\n**Final Plan**\n\n1. **Search for the Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.**\n   - `:evidence0:` = DuckDuckGo[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner\"]\n\n2. **Extract links from the search results.**\n   - `:evidence1:` = HyperlinkExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\n3. **Scrape text from the extracted links.**\n   - `:evidence2:` = TextScraper[:evidence1:]\n\n4. **Use KnowledgeModel to answer the question based on the scraped text.**\n   - `:evidence3:` = KnowledgeModel[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 and what is their most famous work? Given context: :evidence2:\"]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n`:evidence3:`"
