        "content": "So I have this problem here: In a class of 30 students, 18 play soccer, 12 play basketball, and 6 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play any sport. Hmm, sounds like a typical set theory problem, maybe involving Venn diagrams.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many students play at least one of the sports. Since some students play both sports, I can't just add the number of soccer players and basketball players together because that would count the students who play both sports twice.\n\nSo, the total number of students who play at least one sport is the number who play soccer plus the number who play basketball minus the number who play both. That makes sense.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal playing at least one sport = Soccer players + Basketball players - Both sports players\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal playing at least one sport = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24 students\n\nNow, since there are 30 students in total, the number of students who don't play any sport would be the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport.\n\nSo:\n\nStudents not playing any sport = Total students - Total playing at least one sport\n\nStudents not playing any sport = 30 - 24 = 6 students\n\nWait, but is there another way to verify this? Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or something like that.\n\nLet me think about it again. The principle of inclusion-exclusion for two sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A| is the number of elements in set A (soccer players)\n\n- |B| is the number of elements in set B (basketball players)\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of elements in both sets (both sports players)\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the number of elements in either set A or set B or both\n\nIn this case:\n\n|A| = 18\n\n|B| = 12\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 6\n\nSo,\n\n|A \u222a B| = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24\n\nAnd the total number of students is 30, so students not playing any sport are indeed 30 - 24 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- S = set of soccer players\n\n- B = set of basketball players\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |S| = 18\n\n- |B| = 12\n\n- |S \u2229 B| = 6\n\nWe need to find the number of students who are neither in S nor in B, which is the complement of S \u222a B.\n\nGiven that the total number of students is 30, it's again 30 - |S \u222a B| = 30 - 24 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\n- The overlap (both sports) is 6 students.\n\n- So, only soccer players are 18 - 6 = 12 students.\n\n- Only basketball players are 12 - 6 = 6 students.\n\n- Both sports are 6 students.\n\nAdding up the parts: 12 (only soccer) + 6 (only basketball) + 6 (both) = 24 students play at least one sport.\n\nTotal students are 30, so 30 - 24 = 6 students play no sport.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities or some other method.\n\nWell, since we're dealing with sets and finite numbers, set theory seems the most straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider making a table or a chart to represent the students, but that might be more time-consuming.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance that some students might not play any sport and see if my answer accounts for that.\n\nIn my calculation, I subtracted the number of students playing at least one sport from the total number of students to find those who play no sport.\n\nSo, students not playing any sport = total students - students playing at least one sport.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that in some problems, the numbers might not add up correctly if there are students who play more than two sports, but in this case, it's only soccer and basketball mentioned.\n\nSo, no need to worry about that here.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 6 students do not play any sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
