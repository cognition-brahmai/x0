        "content": "So there are 100 students in a school, and each student knows at least one other student. We need to find out the minimum number of friendships that can exist among them. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. A friendship here seems to mean a relationship between two students who know each other. So, if student A knows student B, that counts as one friendship. But in reality, that's a mutual relationship, right? So, does this mean that each friendship is counted once for each pair that knows each other?\n\nWait, but in graph theory terms, this sounds like a graph where students are vertices and friendships are edges connecting them. Each student knows at least one other student, so no isolated vertices. We need to find the minimum number of edges in such a graph with 100 vertices.\n\nOkay, so in graph theory, the minimal connected graph with no isolated vertices is a tree. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. So, for 100 students, would the minimal number of friendships be 99?\n\nBut wait, the problem says each student knows at least one other student, which means no isolated vertices. However, a tree ensures that there are no isolated vertices and it has the minimal number of edges without having any cycles.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is 99 friendships.\n\nBut let me think differently. Suppose we have some students knowing more than one other student, could we have fewer friendships? Wait, no, because in a tree, which is the minimal connected graph, you have n-1 edges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph doesn't have to be connected. The problem says each student knows at least one other student, but it doesn't say that the entire group is connected. So, could there be multiple connected components?\n\nIf that's allowed, then perhaps we can have more components, which might reduce the total number of edges.\n\nFor example, if we have two separate groups of students, each forming their own tree, then the total number of edges would be (number of students in first tree - 1) + (number of students in second tree -1), and so on.\n\nSo, if we have k components, each being a tree, then the total number of edges would be (100 - k).\n\nBut, to minimize the number of friendships (edges), we need to maximize k, because fewer edges per component.\n\nWait, but each component is a tree, so edges = vertices - 1.\n\nTherefore, total edges = (100 - k).\n\nTo minimize edges, maximize k.\n\nBut, the problem states that every student knows at least one other student, which means no isolated students, so each component must have at least two students.\n\nBecause if a component has only one student, that student doesn't know any other student, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of friendships would be achieved when we have as many components as possible, each with at least two students.\n\nSo, to maximize k, with each component having at least two students, the maximum k is 50, which would be 50 components, each with 2 students.\n\nEach component (which is a tree with 2 students) has 1 edge.\n\nTherefore, total edges = 50 * 1 = 50.\n\nSo, the minimal number of friendships is 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 99 if it's a single tree.\n\nBut with multiple components, we can have fewer edges.\n\nSo, 50 seems to be the minimal number.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nIf we have 50 components, each with 2 students, and each component is a tree with 1 edge, then total edges are 50.\n\nIs there a way to have fewer than 50 edges while ensuring every student knows at least one other student?\n\nSuppose we try to have a component with 3 students. That would be a tree with 2 edges.\n\nBut to minimize edges, we should avoid larger components because they require more edges per student.\n\nWait, no. In terms of edges per student, in a component of size m, edges = m - 1.\n\nSo, for m=2, edges=1; m=3, edges=2; etc.\n\nTherefore, to minimize total edges, we should have as many components of size 2 as possible.\n\nBecause, for example, two components of size 2 have 2 edges, while one component of size 4 has 3 edges.\n\nSo, more small components lead to fewer edges.\n\nHence, with 100 students, the minimal number of friendships is 50.\n\nWait, but in reality, friendships are mutual, so an edge between two students represents a mutual knowledge.\n\nSo, in graph theory terms, this is an undirected graph.\n\nIs there any other consideration I'm missing?\n\nOh, perhaps the problem allows for the possibility of multiple friendships between students, but based on the wording, it seems like simple edges, no multiple edges.\n\nAlso, no self-loops, since a student can't be friends with themselves.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with minimal friendships, we don't need to consider multiple edges.\n\nSo, I think 50 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more optimized way, but I can't see it right now.\n\nSo, the minimal number of friendships is 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
