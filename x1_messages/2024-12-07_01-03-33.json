The park will be built on a 50-acre plot of land, with 60% dedicated to green spaces, 30% for recreational facilities, and the remaining 10% for parking and other amenities. Calculate the total area allocated for each type of space within the park and provide step-by-step reasoning."

        "content": "So I've got this problem about planning a new public park, and I need to figure out how much area is allocated for different things like green spaces, recreational facilities, and parking. The park is on a 50-acre plot, and the percentages are given for each type of space. Let's see:\n\nFirst, the total area of the park is 50 acres.\n\nNow, 60% of that is dedicated to green spaces, 30% to recreational facilities, and 10% to parking and other amenities.\n\nI need to calculate the area for each of these categories.\n\nStarting with green spaces:\n\nGreen spaces are 60% of the total area.\n\nSo, I need to find 60% of 50 acres.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 50 by 0.60.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n50 * 0.60 = 30 acres.\n\nSo, green spaces get 30 acres.\n\nNext, recreational facilities are 30% of the total area.\n\nAgain, I'll multiply 50 acres by 0.30.\n\n50 * 0.30 = 15 acres.\n\nSo, recreational facilities get 15 acres.\n\nFinally, parking and other amenities are 10% of the total area.\n\nSo, 50 acres multiplied by 0.10.\n\n50 * 0.10 = 5 acres.\n\nTherefore, parking and other amenities get 5 acres.\n\nLet me just double-check that all the areas add up to the total.\n\nGreen spaces: 30 acres\n\nRecreational facilities: 15 acres\n\nParking and amenities: 5 acres\n\nTotal: 30 + 15 + 5 = 50 acres.\n\nYes, that matches the total area available.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Green spaces: 30 acres\n\n- Recreational facilities: 15 acres\n\n- Parking and amenities: 5 acres\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Green spaces: } 30 \\text{ acres}, \\text{ Recreational facilities: } 15 \\text{ acres}, \\text{ Parking and amenities: } 5 \\text{ acres}} \\]"
