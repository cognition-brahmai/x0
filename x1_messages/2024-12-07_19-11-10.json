        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people, and their eyes are categorized into three colors: brown, blue, and green. The percentages given are 40% for brown, 30% for blue, and the remaining 30% for green eyes. Additionally, there are 12 more people with brown eyes than with blue eyes. We need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nFirst, let's understand what percentages represent here. Percentages are parts of 100, so if we have a group of people, 40% of them have brown eyes, 30% have blue eyes, and 30% have green eyes. This means that for every 100 people in the group, 40 have brown eyes, 30 have blue eyes, and 30 have green eyes.\n\nBut in this problem, the group isn't necessarily 100 people; it's an unknown number of people, which we'll call \"total people\" or \"N.\" So, 40% of N have brown eyes, 30% of N have blue eyes, and 30% of N have green eyes.\n\nNow, the problem states that there are 12 more people with brown eyes than with blue eyes. That means the number of people with brown eyes is equal to the number of people with blue eyes plus 12.\n\nLet's express this in terms of N:\n\nNumber of people with brown eyes = 40% of N = 0.4N\n\nNumber of people with blue eyes = 30% of N = 0.3N\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n0.4N = 0.3N + 12\n\nNow, we can solve for N:\n\nSubtract 0.3N from both sides:\n\n0.4N - 0.3N = 12\n\n0.1N = 12\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.1:\n\nN = 12 / 0.1\n\nN = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 people in the group.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf there are 120 people in total:\n\n- 40% have brown eyes: 0.4 * 120 = 48 people\n\n- 30% have blue eyes: 0.3 * 120 = 36 people\n\n- 30% have green eyes: 0.3 * 120 = 36 people\n\nNow, checking the difference between brown and blue eyes:\n\n48 (brown) - 36 (blue) = 12 people\n\nYes, that matches the information given in the problem. So, our answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
