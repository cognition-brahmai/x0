        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a train that goes from Town A to Town B at 60 mph, then from Town B to Town C at 80 mph. The total distance from A to C is 420 miles, and the whole trip takes 6 hours. We need to find the distance between Town A and Town B.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the distance from Town A to Town B is \\(d_{ab}\\) miles, and the distance from Town B to Town C is \\(d_{bc}\\) miles. We know that the total distance is 420 miles, so:\n\n\\[ d_{ab} + d_{bc} = 420 \\]\n\nNext, we know the speeds for each part of the trip. From A to B, the speed is 60 mph, and from B to C, it's 80 mph. We also know that the total time for the trip is 6 hours.\n\nTime is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the time from A to B is \\( \\frac{d_{ab}}{60} \\) hours, and the time from B to C is \\( \\frac{d_{bc}}{80} \\) hours. The sum of these times is 6 hours:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d_{ab}}{60} + \\frac{d_{bc}}{80} = 6 \\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( d_{ab} + d_{bc} = 420 \\)\n\n2. \\( \\frac{d_{ab}}{60} + \\frac{d_{bc}}{80} = 6 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find \\(d_{ab}\\).\n\nFirst, let's express \\(d_{bc}\\) in terms of \\(d_{ab}\\) using the first equation:\n\n\\[ d_{bc} = 420 - d_{ab} \\]\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d_{ab}}{60} + \\frac{420 - d_{ab}}{80} = 6 \\]\n\nTo make this easier to solve, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 60 and 80, and their least common multiple is 240. We can multiply both sides of the equation by 240 to eliminate the denominators:\n\n\\[ 240 \\times \\left( \\frac{d_{ab}}{60} + \\frac{420 - d_{ab}}{80} \\right) = 240 \\times 6 \\]\n\n\\[ 240 \\times \\frac{d_{ab}}{60} + 240 \\times \\frac{420 - d_{ab}}{80} = 1440 \\]\n\nNow, calculate each term:\n\n\\[ 240 \\div 60 = 4, \\ so \\ 4 d_{ab} \\]\n\n\\[ 240 \\div 80 = 3, \\ so \\ 3 (420 - d_{ab}) \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 d_{ab} + 3 (420 - d_{ab}) = 1440 \\]\n\nNow, distribute the 3:\n\n\\[ 4 d_{ab} + 1260 - 3 d_{ab} = 1440 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ (4 d_{ab} - 3 d_{ab}) + 1260 = 1440 \\]\n\n\\[ d_{ab} + 1260 = 1440 \\]\n\nSubtract 1260 from both sides:\n\n\\[ d_{ab} = 1440 - 1260 \\]\n\n\\[ d_{ab} = 180 \\]\n\nSo, the distance between Town A and Town B is 180 miles.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If \\(d_{ab} = 180\\) miles, then \\(d_{bc} = 420 - 180 = 240\\) miles.\n\nTime from A to B: \\( \\frac{180}{60} = 3 \\) hours\n\nTime from B to C: \\( \\frac{240}{80} = 3 \\) hours\n\nTotal time: \\( 3 + 3 = 6 \\) hours, which matches the given total time.\n\nEverything checks out, so the answer is indeed 180 miles."
