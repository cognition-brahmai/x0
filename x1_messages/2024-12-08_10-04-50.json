        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a father and his son, and we're trying to figure out their current ages based on the information given.\n\nFirst, it says that the father is three times older than his son right now. So, if we let the son's current age be S, then the father's current age would be 3S, right? Because three times the son's age.\n\nOkay, so:\n\nFather's age = 3S\n\nSon's age = S\n\nNow, the second part says that in 12 years, the father will be twice as old as his son. So, in 12 years, the son's age will be S + 12, and the father's age will be 3S + 12.\n\nAnd at that time, the father's age will be twice the son's age. So, we can write that as:\n\n3S + 12 = 2(S + 12)\n\nAlright, now we just need to solve for S.\n\nLet's expand the right side:\n\n3S + 12 = 2S + 24\n\nNow, subtract 2S from both sides:\n\n3S - 2S + 12 = 2S - 2S + 24\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nS + 12 = 24\n\nNow, subtract 12 from both sides:\n\nS + 12 - 12 = 24 - 12\n\nSo:\n\nS = 12\n\nOkay, so the son is currently 12 years old. Since the father is three times older than the son, that means the father is 3 times 12, which is 36 years old.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this makes sense in 12 years.\n\nIn 12 years, the son will be 12 + 12 = 24 years old.\n\nAnd the father will be 36 + 12 = 48 years old.\n\nIs 48 twice of 24? Yes, because 2 times 24 is 48.\n\nSo, it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the father is currently 36 years old, and the son is 12 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Father: } 36 \\text{ years old, Son: } 12 \\text{ years old}} \\]"
