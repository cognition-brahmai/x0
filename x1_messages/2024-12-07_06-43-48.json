        "content": "To calculate the definite integral of the function \\( g(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2 \\) from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = 5 \\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the antiderivative of \\( g(x) \\):**\n   The antiderivative, also known as the indefinite integral, is found by integrating each term of the function separately.\n\n   \\[\n   \\int (3x^2 - 4x + 2) \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 3x^2 \\) is \\( x^3 \\) because \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2 \\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\( -4x \\) is \\( -2x^2 \\) because \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(-2x^2) = -4x \\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 2 \\) is \\( 2x \\) because \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2 \\).\n\n   So, the antiderivative \\( G(x) \\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   G(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x + C\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration. For definite integrals, the constant will cancel out, so we can proceed without specifying \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (x = 5):**\n\n   \\[\n   G(5) = (5)^3 - 2(5)^2 + 2(5) = 125 - 50 + 10 = 85\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the antiderivative at the lower limit (x = 0):**\n\n   \\[\n   G(0) = (0)^3 - 2(0)^2 + 2(0) = 0 - 0 + 0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the value at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{5} (3x^2 - 4x + 2) \\, dx = G(5) - G(0) = 85 - 0 = 85\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the definite integral of \\( g(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2 \\) from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = 5 \\) is \\( 85 \\).\n\n**Alternative method using the fundamental theorem of calculus:**\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus states that if \\( g(x) \\) is continuous on \\( [a, b] \\) and \\( G(x) \\) is an antiderivative of \\( g(x) \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{a}^{b} g(x) \\, dx = G(b) - G(a)\n\\]\n\nWe have already found \\( G(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x \\), and evaluated it at \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = 0 \\), leading to the same result of \\( 85 \\).\n\n**Checking the result with numerical methods:**\n\nTo verify our result, we can use numerical integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. However, since the function is a polynomial and the antiderivative is exact, the numerical methods should approximate to the same value.\n\nFor example, using the trapezoidal rule with \\( n = 4 \\) intervals:\n\n- Divide the interval \\( [0, 5] \\) into 4 equal parts: \\( \\Delta x = \\frac{5 - 0}{4} = 1.25 \\)\n- The points are \\( x_0 = 0 \\), \\( x_1 = 1.25 \\), \\( x_2 = 2.5 \\), \\( x_3 = 3.75 \\), \\( x_4 = 5 \\)\n- Evaluate \\( g(x) \\) at these points:\n  - \\( g(0) = 2 \\)\n  - \\( g(1.25) = 3(1.25)^2 - 4(1.25) + 2 = 3(1.5625) - 5 + 2 = 4.6875 - 5 + 2 = 1.6875 \\)\n  - \\( g(2.5) = 3(2.5)^2 - 4(2.5) + 2 = 3(6.25) - 10 + 2 = 18.75 - 10 + 2 = 10.75 \\)\n  - \\( g(3.75) = 3(3.75)^2 - 4(3.75) + 2 = 3(14.0625) - 15 + 2 = 42.1875 - 15 + 2 = 29.1875 \\)\n  - \\( g(5) = 3(5)^2 - 4(5) + 2 = 75 - 20 + 2 = 57 \\)\n\n- Apply the trapezoidal rule formula:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{5} g(x) \\, dx \\approx \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\left[ g(x_0) + 2g(x_1) + 2g(x_2) + 2g(x_3) + g(x_4) \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1.25}{2} \\left[ 2 + 2(1.6875) + 2(10.75) + 2(29.1875) + 57 \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.625 \\left[ 2 + 3.375 + 21.5 + 58.375 + 57 \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.625 \\left[ 142.25 \\right] = 88.875\n\\]\n\nThis approximation is \\( 88.875 \\), which is close to our exact value of \\( 85 \\), but not exact due to the limited number of intervals. Increasing \\( n \\) would improve the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe exact value of the integral is \\( 85 \\), as calculated using the antiderivative method. The numerical method provides an approximation that is close but not exact, highlighting the importance of using exact methods when possible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{85} \\]"
