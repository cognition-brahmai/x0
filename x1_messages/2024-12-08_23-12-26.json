        "content": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 8 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 5 + 7 + 8, which is 20 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing exactly one ball of each color when I draw 3 balls without replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a ball, I don't put it back into the bag. So, each draw affects the remaining balls in the bag.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 20 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 20 is C(20, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1140.\n\nSo, there are 1140 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 20.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing exactly one ball of each color. So, one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nSince the balls are drawn without replacement, the order in which I draw them doesn't matter for the combination, but I need to make sure that I'm accounting for each color being represented exactly once.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose one red ball out of five is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one blue ball out of seven is C(7, 1) = 7.\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one green ball out of eight is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nTo find the total number of favorable outcomes, I multiply these together because these are independent choices:\n\n5 (red) \u00d7 7 (blue) \u00d7 8 (green) = 280.\n\nSo, there are 280 ways to draw one ball of each color.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 280 / 1140.\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n280 \u00f7 20 = 14\n\n1140 \u00f7 20 = 57\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 14/57.\n\nWait a minute, can I simplify it further? Let's check.\n\n14 and 57 have no common factors other than 1, so 14/57 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly one ball of each color is 14/57.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the order in which the balls are drawn. Since the problem says \"draw 3 balls without replacement,\" and we're interested in the combination (not permutation), because the order doesn't matter for the colors being represented.\n\nYes, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 14/57.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{57}} \\]"
