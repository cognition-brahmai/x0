Media studies.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Media Studies**: This branch focuses on the content, history, and effects of various media. Social media is a form of media, and studying its impact on society aligns directly with the objectives of media studies. Researchers in this field would examine how social media influences public opinion, social behaviors, and cultural trends.\n\n- **Interpersonal Communication**: While interpersonal communication deals with exchanges between individuals, it primarily focuses on dyadic or small group interactions. Although social media facilitates interpersonal communication, the broader societal impact is more aligned with media studies.\n\n- **Public Speaking**: This area concerns the act of speaking to a live audience. While public speaking can be done through media platforms, the core focus is on the delivery and reception in a direct, face-to-face setting. The impact of social media on society is beyond the scope of public speaking.\n\nTherefore, media studies is the most appropriate choice for studying the impact of social media on society."
