        "content": "So, there's a class with 30 students in total, and out of those, 18 are boys. You want to know how many girls are in the class. Let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that the entire class consists of both boys and girls. So, the total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls. If we let the number of girls be represented by the letter G, then we can write this relationship as:\n\nTotal students = Boys + Girls\n\nWe're given that the total number of students is 30 and the number of boys is 18. So, plugging those numbers into the equation, we get:\n\n30 = 18 + G\n\nNow, to find out what G is, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation. When we do that, we get:\n\n30 - 18 = G\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n12 = G\n\nSo, there are 12 girls in the class.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that if 18 out of 30 students are boys, then the remaining students must be girls. So, subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students gives us the number of girls:\n\nGirls = Total students - Boys\n\nGirls = 30 - 18\n\nGirls = 12\n\nEither way, we arrive at the same conclusion that there are 12 girls in the class.\n\nTo double-check, we can add the number of boys and girls together to see if they total up to 30:\n\n18 boys + 12 girls = 30 students\n\nYes, that matches the total number of students given, so we can be confident that our answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
