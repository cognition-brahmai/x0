Despite these similarities, Venus has a dramatically different climate, being the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. This extreme heat is due to its thick atmosphere, which is composed mostly of carbon dioxide and causes a runaway greenhouse effect."
