        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the baker uses 15 eggs for every 20 cakes she bakes. We need to find out how many eggs she uses if she bakes 100 cakes.\n\nFirst, I should understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cakes. It seems like there's a ratio here: 15 eggs to 20 cakes. Maybe I can simplify this ratio to make it easier to work with.\n\nLet me see, 15 and 20 both divisible by 5. So, 15 divided by 5 is 3, and 20 divided by 5 is 4. So, the simplified ratio is 3 eggs for every 4 cakes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many eggs are used for 100 cakes. Since I have the ratio of eggs to cakes, I can set up a proportion to solve for the number of eggs needed for 100 cakes.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of eggs needed for 100 cakes as x.\n\nSo, the proportion would be:\n\n3 eggs / 4 cakes = x eggs / 100 cakes\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n3 * 100 = 4 * x\n\n300 = 4x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:\n\nx = 300 / 4\n\nx = 75\n\nSo, the baker uses 75 eggs to bake 100 cakes.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to think about this. Since 100 cakes is five times more than 20 cakes (because 20 * 5 = 100), maybe I can just multiply the number of eggs by 5 as well.\n\nLet's check: 15 eggs * 5 = 75 eggs.\n\nThat matches the answer I got from the proportion method. So, either way, it seems like 75 eggs are needed for 100 cakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of eggs per cake. If 15 eggs are used for 20 cakes, then the number of eggs per cake is 15/20 = 0.75 eggs per cake.\n\nThen, for 100 cakes, it would be 0.75 * 100 = 75 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer. It's good that all these different methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I've covered this thoroughly. The answer is 75 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
