        "content": "So, the question is: If every cat has 9 lives, and each life has 7 years, how old is a cat in its last year of its last life? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, it's said that every cat has 9 lives. And each of these lives is 7 years long. So, basically, each life cycle of a cat is 7 years.\n\nNow, if a cat has 9 lives, that means it goes through 9 cycles of 7 years each. So, to find out how old the cat is in total, I need to multiply the number of lives by the number of years per life.\n\nSo, that's 9 lives times 7 years per life:\n\n9 * 7 = 63 years.\n\nBut the question is asking for the age of the cat in its last year of its last life. So, in the 9th life, during its last year, how old is the cat?\n\nWell, if each life is 7 years, then in the 9th life, the cat has already completed 8 lives, which is 8 * 7 = 56 years. Then, in its 9th life, it's in its last year, which is the 7th year of that life.\n\nSo, total age would be 56 years plus 7 years, which is 63 years.\n\nWait, but that seems the same as just multiplying 9 by 7 directly. Is there a different way to look at it?\n\nLet me think another way. If each life is 7 years, and there are 9 lives, then the total span of all lives is 9 * 7 = 63 years.\n\nNow, in its last year of the last life, it's essentially in its 63rd year of life.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's consider that in the first life, it lives 7 years, in the second life, another 7 years, and so on, up to the ninth life.\n\nSo, after eight lives, the cat has lived 8 * 7 = 56 years.\n\nIn the ninth life, it's living its last year, which is the 7th year of that life.\n\nTherefore, it's 56 years plus 7 years, which is 63 years.\n\nAlternatively, since each life is 7 years, and it's in the last year of its ninth life, we can think of it as having completed 8 full lives (8 * 7 = 56 years) plus the current year in its ninth life.\n\nSo, it's 56 years plus 1 year in its ninth life.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies that each life has 7 years, so the last year of the ninth life would be the 63rd year.\n\nWait, there might be some confusion here.\n\nLet me try to clarify.\n\nIf each life is 7 years, and there are 9 lives, then:\n\n- Life 1: years 1 to 7\n\n- Life 2: years 8 to 14\n\n- Life 3: years 15 to 21\n\n- Life 4: years 22 to 28\n\n- Life 5: years 29 to 35\n\n- Life 6: years 36 to 42\n\n- Life 7: years 43 to 49\n\n- Life 8: years 50 to 56\n\n- Life 9: years 57 to 63\n\nSo, in its last year of the ninth life, it would be 63 years old.\n\nWait, but the question might be interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking how old the cat is in terms of human years or something, but I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a trick question, and the cat is always a cat, regardless of the lives it has left.\n\nBut according to the problem, it's 9 lives, each 7 years long, so total age would be 63 years.\n\nSo, in its last year of its last life, it's 63 years old.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]"
