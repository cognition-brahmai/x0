        "content": "In the world of ballet, the term that refers to a full 360-degree turn on one foot is called a \"pirouette.\" Pirouettes are a fundamental technique in ballet and are performed by dancers in many classical ballet pieces. The term \"pirouette\" comes from the French word meaning \"whirl\" or \"spin.\" There are different types of pirouettes, including single, double, and multiple turns, and they can be executed in various positions, such as en dehors (turning outward) or en dedans (turning inward). Mastering pirouettes requires strong core stability, proper alignment, and precise spotting techniques to maintain balance and control during the rotation."
