        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular room that's 24 feet long and 18 feet wide, and I need to cover the floor with square tiles that are 2 feet by 2 feet each. I need to find out the minimum number of these tiles required to cover the entire floor.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the area of the room and the area of one tile, and then see how many tiles fit into the room's area. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the area of the room is length times width, right? So, that would be 24 feet times 18 feet. Let me calculate that:\n\n24 \u00d7 18 = 432 square feet.\n\nNow, each tile is 2 feet by 2 feet, so the area of one tile is 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 square feet.\n\nTo find out how many tiles I need, I should divide the total area of the room by the area of one tile. So, 432 square feet divided by 4 square feet per tile.\n\n432 \u00f7 4 = 108.\n\nSo, I need 108 tiles to cover the floor.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to think about how many tiles fit along the length and how many fit along the width, and then multiply those numbers together.\n\nThe length of the room is 24 feet, and each tile is 2 feet long, so the number of tiles along the length would be 24 \u00f7 2 = 12 tiles.\n\nThe width of the room is 18 feet, and each tile is 2 feet wide, so the number of tiles along the width would be 18 \u00f7 2 = 9 tiles.\n\nThen, the total number of tiles would be 12 tiles along the length times 9 tiles along the width, which is 12 \u00d7 9 = 108 tiles.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it seems like 108 tiles are needed.\n\nBut let me think again: is there any possibility of needing fewer tiles? Maybe if I arrange them differently or something. But since the tiles are square and the room is rectangular, and the dimensions are evenly divisible by the tile size, there shouldn't be any need for cutting tiles or anything like that.\n\nSo, the minimum number of tiles needed is indeed 108.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]"
