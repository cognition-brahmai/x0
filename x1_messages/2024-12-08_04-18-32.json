        "content": "To find out how many gallons of water the cylindrical container can hold, we first need to calculate the volume of the cylinder in cubic inches and then convert that volume to gallons.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nwhere:\n\n- V is the volume\n\n- r is the radius\n\n- h is the height\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 5 inches and the height (h) is 10 inches, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0*(5)\u00b2*10\n\nV = \u03c0*25*10\n\nV = \u03c0*250\n\nNow, the value of \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.1416.\n\nSo,\n\nV \u2248 3.1416 * 250\n\nV \u2248 785.4 cubic inches\n\nNow, we need to convert cubic inches to gallons. We're told that 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches.\n\nSo, the number of gallons (G) the cylinder can hold is:\n\nG = V / 231\n\nG \u2248 785.4 / 231\n\nG \u2248 3.399 gallons\n\nTherefore, the cylindrical container can hold approximately 3.4 gallons of water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.4} \\]"
