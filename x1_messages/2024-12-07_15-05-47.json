        "content": "So, let's see. The store currently sells 20 items per day at an average price of $15. So, their current daily revenue is 20 items times $15 per item, which is $300 per day.\n\nNow, if they increase their sales by 25%, that means they're selling 25% more items. So, 25% of 20 is 5 items. So, 20 plus 5 is 25 items per day.\n\nAdditionally, they're raising the average price to $18 per item. So, the new revenue would be 25 items times $18 per item, which is $450 per day.\n\nTo find out how much more revenue that is compared to before, we subtract the original revenue from the new revenue: $450 minus $300, which is $150.\n\nSo, the store would generate an additional $150 per day with these changes.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, if sales increase by 25%, and prices increase by whatever amount to reach $18 from $15, which is a $3 increase, or a 20% increase.\n\nWait, $18 is $3 more than $15, and 3 divided by 15 is 0.2, or 20%. So, a 20% increase in price.\n\nSo, total revenue change would be the combination of the percentage increase in sales and the percentage increase in price.\n\nSo, total revenue increase percentage would be approximately the sum of the percentage increases plus the product of the percentages. That is, 25% plus 20% plus (25% times 20%).\n\n25% plus 20% is 45%, and 25% of 20% is 5%, so total revenue increase is 50%.\n\nSo, 50% of original revenue is 50% of $300, which is $150. So, again, $450 new revenue.\n\nWait, but I think that's the same as what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, you can calculate it as:\n\nNew revenue = original quantity times (1 + sales increase percentage) times original price times (1 + price increase percentage).\n\nSo, that's 20 times 1.25 times 15 times 1.20.\n\nWait, but that seems off because you're multiplying quantity and price separately by their respective increases.\n\nWait, no, actually, revenue is quantity times price.\n\nSo, new revenue = (original quantity * (1 + sales increase)) * (original price * (1 + price increase))\n\nSo, that's 20 * 1.25 * 15 * 1.20.\n\nWait, but that would be 25 * 18, which is $450, same as before.\n\nSo, yeah, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, using percentages:\n\nOriginal revenue: 20 * 15 = $300.\n\nSales increase: 25%, so additional 5 items, so 25 items.\n\nPrice increase: from $15 to $18, which is a $3 increase, or 20% increase.\n\nSo, new revenue: 25 items * $18 = $450.\n\nDifference: $450 - $300 = $150.\n\nAlternatively, using percentage increases:\n\nTotal revenue change = (1 + sales growth rate) * (1 + price growth rate) - 1.\n\nSo, that's (1 + 0.25) * (1 + 0.20) - 1 = 1.25 * 1.20 - 1 = 1.50 - 1 = 0.50, or 50%.\n\nSo, 50% of original revenue is $150.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same conclusion: the store would generate an additional $150 per day.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way.\n\nSuppose they sell 25 items at the original price of $15: that would be 25 * 15 = $375.\n\nBut they're raising the price to $18, so each item brings in an extra $3.\n\nSo, for 25 items, that's an additional 25 * $3 = $75.\n\nSo, $375 plus $75 is $450, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if they keep the original sales volume of 20 items but raise the price to $18, that would be 20 * 18 = $360.\n\nThen, with the increased sales volume of 25 items at $18, it's 25 * 18 = $450.\n\nSo, again, $450.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of contribution per item.\n\nOriginal: 20 items at $15 = $300.\n\nNew: 25 items at $18 = $450.\n\nDifference: $150.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\n- Additional revenue from increased sales volume: 5 items at $15 = $75.\n\n- Additional revenue from price increase: 25 items * $3 = $75.\n\n- Total additional revenue: $75 + $75 = $150.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right.\n\nWait, if they increase sales first, then price, or vice versa.\n\nWait, actually, it's a combined effect.\n\nBut in reality, it's best to calculate it as new quantity times new price minus original quantity times original price.\n\nSo, 25 * 18 - 20 * 15 = 450 - 300 = 150.\n\nSo, $150 is the correct additional revenue.\n\nAlternatively, using only percentages:\n\nOriginal revenue: R = Q * P.\n\nNew revenue: Q' = Q * (1 + s), where s is sales growth rate.\n\nP' = P * (1 + p), where p is price growth rate.\n\nSo, R' = Q' * P' = Q*(1+s) * P*(1+p) = Q*P*(1+s)*(1+p).\n\nSo, change in revenue: R' - R = R*(1+s)*(1+p) - R = R[(1+s)(1+p) - 1].\n\nSo, percentage change: [(1+s)(1+p) - 1].\n\nSo, plugging in s = 0.25 and p = 0.20:\n\n(1.25)(1.20) - 1 = 1.50 - 1 = 0.50, or 50%.\n\nSo, 50% of original revenue is $150.\n\nSo, all these methods confirm that the store would generate an additional $150 per day with the proposed changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
