        "content": "So there's this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a group of 50 people, and they're divided into vegetarians and non-vegetarians. There are 20 vegetarians and 30 non-vegetarians. Among these, 5 vegetarians and 10 non-vegetarians wear glasses. The question is, if you pick someone at random from this group, what's the probability that they're a vegetarian who wears glasses?\n\nOkay, probability questions can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. First, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of people in the group, which is 50. The favorable outcome is picking a vegetarian who wears glasses. So, I need to find out how many people are vegetarians who wear glasses.\n\nFrom the problem, it says that there are 5 vegetarians who wear glasses. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 5.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 5 (vegetarians who wear glasses) divided by 50 (total people), which simplifies to 1/10 or 0.1.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I'm not missing anything. Is there any other information that might affect this probability? For example, the number of non-vegetarians who wear glasses is given as 10, but since we're only interested in vegetarians who wear glasses, that shouldn't affect our calculation directly.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, maybe I should verify if there's any overlap or other conditions that could change the probability. But in this case, it seems straightforward. We have a specific group: vegetarians who wear glasses, and we're picking one person at random from the entire group.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider it as conditional probability, but actually, it's not, because we're not given any conditions. We're just picking one person at random and wanting to know the probability that they fall into a specific category.\n\nSo, probability = (number of vegetarians who wear glasses) / (total number of people) = 5 / 50 = 1/10.\n\nExpressing it as a decimal, that's 0.1, or as a percentage, 10%.\n\nBut the question might expect the answer in fraction form, so 1/10 is probably the most simplified form.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using combinations or other probability rules, but it seems unnecessary here because it's a straightforward probability calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as: what is the probability of selecting a vegetarian who wears glasses?\n\nGiven that there are 20 vegetarians out of 50, and among those 20, 5 wear glasses.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a vegetarian is 20/50, and then given that they're vegetarian, the probability that they wear glasses is 5/20.\n\nBut that would be the conditional probability P(wears glasses | vegetarian), which is 5/20 = 1/4.\n\nBut the original question is for the joint probability P(vegetarian and wears glasses), which is 5/50 = 1/10.\n\nSo, my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should confirm this with another method.\n\nLet's consider the entire group:\n\n- Total people: 50\n\n- Vegetarians: 20\n\n- Non-vegetarians: 30\n\n- Vegetarians who wear glasses: 5\n\n- Non-vegetarians who wear glasses: 10\n\nSo, the total number of people who wear glasses is 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nBut again, we're specifically interested in vegetarians who wear glasses, which is 5.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 5/50 = 1/10.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the probability of selecting a vegetarian is 20/50 = 2/5, and the probability that a vegetarian wears glasses is 5/20 = 1/4.\n\nIf I were to multiply these, I'd get (2/5) * (1/4) = 2/20 = 1/10, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, that reinforces that 1/10 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can look at it in terms of a table.\n\nLet's create a contingency table:\n\n|                | Vegetarian | Non-vegetarian | Total |\n\n|----------------|------------|----------------|-------|\n\n| Wear glasses   | 5          | 10             | 15    |\n\n| Don't wear glasses | 15       | 20             | 35    |\n\n| Total          | 20         | 30             | 50    |\n\nFrom this table, it's clear that the number of vegetarians who wear glasses is 5, and the total number of people is 50.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/50 = 1/10.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. I've approached the problem in different ways and consistently get the same answer.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen person from the group is a vegetarian who wears glasses is 1/10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{10}} \\]"
