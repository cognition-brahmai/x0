        "content": "So you're asking about the probability of getting exactly 50 heads when you flip a fair coin 100 times. That's an interesting question and it's related to something called the binomial distribution in probability theory.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure we understand what a fair coin is. A fair coin has two sides, heads and tails, and each side has an equal probability of landing face up. So, the probability of getting heads in a single flip is 0.5, and the same goes for tails.\n\nNow, when you flip the coin 100 times, each flip is independent of the others. That means the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the outcome of any other flip. Because of this independence, we can use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of getting exactly 50 heads.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 coin flips)\n\n- k is the number of successful trials you're interested in (here, 50 heads)\n\n- p is the probability of success on an individual trial (0.5 for heads)\n\n- \"n choose k\" is a combination, which calculates the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials without regard to order.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP(50) = (100 choose 50) * (0.5)^50 * (0.5)^(100-50)\n\nSimplify that:\n\nP(50) = (100 choose 50) * (0.5)^50 * (0.5)^50\n\nWhich is:\n\nP(50) = (100 choose 50) * (0.5)^100\n\nNow, \"100 choose 50\" is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n\n(100 choose 50) = 100! / (50! * (100-50)!)\n\nWhere \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, 50! is 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1.\n\nCalculating factorials for large numbers like 100 can be cumbersome, but fortunately, there are ways to compute or approximate them.\n\nAlternatively, since the coin is fair and we're looking for exactly half heads and half tails, there's a symmetry here that might simplify things.\n\nBut to get an exact numerical value, we might need to use a calculator or a software tool that can handle large numbers and factorials.\n\nAlternatively, for large n, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean np and variance np(1-p).\n\nIn this case, mean = 100 * 0.5 = 50, and variance = 100 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 25, so standard deviation is sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nUsing the normal approximation, we can estimate the probability of getting exactly 50 heads. However, since the normal distribution is continuous and we're dealing with discrete values, we need to apply a continuity correction.\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads would be approximately the probability that a normal random variable with mean 50 and standard deviation 5 lies between 49.5 and 50.5.\n\nBut since we're dealing with a large n, the exact binomial calculation is still manageable, especially with computational tools.\n\nLet me try to compute the exact value.\n\nFirst, calculate \"100 choose 50\". This is a large number, but it's a specific value.\n\nUsing a calculator or a computational tool, we find that:\n\n(100 choose 50) = 100891344545564193334812497256\n\nThen, (0.5)^100 is a very small number:\n\n(0.5)^100 = 7.888609052210118e-31\n\nSo, multiplying these together:\n\nP(50) = 100891344545564193334812497256 * 7.888609052210118e-31\n\nCalculating that:\n\nP(50) \u2248 0.0795892\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads in 100 flips of a fair coin is approximately 7.96%.\n\nThat's pretty interesting because, intuitively, you might think that getting exactly half heads and half tails would be more likely, but in reality, it's about 8% chance.\n\nIt's also worth noting that even though 50 heads is the most probable single outcome, the probability is still relatively low because there are many other possible outcomes.\n\nMoreover, the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1, so with many possible k values from 0 to 100, the probability for any one specific k is going to be relatively small.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the standard deviation. With a standard deviation of 5, getting exactly 50 heads is right at the mean, so it's the most likely single outcome, but the probability is still only about 8%.\n\nIf you were to ask for the probability of getting between 45 and 55 heads, for example, that probability would be much higher.\n\nBut specifically for exactly 50 heads, it's about 7.96%.\n\nI hope that helps clarify things! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.0795892} \\]"
