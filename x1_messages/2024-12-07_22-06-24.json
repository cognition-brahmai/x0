        "content": "Alright, I'll guide you through creating a Python script that interacts with an AWS S3 bucket. We'll cover listing files, uploading new files, and deleting existing ones. Make sure you have the Boto3 library installed, as it's essential for AWS interactions.\n\nFirst, you need to set up your AWS credentials. The best practice is to configure your AWS CLI or set environment variables. For this script, I'll assume you've already done that.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Install Boto3\n\nIf you haven't installed Boto3 yet, you can do so using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install boto3\n```\n\n### Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nIn your Python script, import the required libraries:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure Boto3\n\nSet up your Boto3 S3 client. You can specify your AWS region here if needed.\n\n```python\ns3 = boto3.client('s3', region_name='your-region')\n```\n\nReplace `'your-region'` with your actual AWS region, e.g., `'us-west-2'`.\n\n### Step 4: List Files in the Bucket\n\nTo list all files in an S3 bucket, you can use the `list_objects_v2` method.\n\n```python\ndef list_files(bucket_name):\n    try:\n        response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)\n        if 'Contents' in response:\n            for item in response['Contents']:\n                print(item['Key'])\n        else:\n            print(\"No files in the bucket.\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n```\n\n### Step 5: Upload a File to the Bucket\n\nTo upload a file, use the `upload_file` method.\n\n```python\ndef upload_file(bucket_name, file_path, object_name=None):\n    if object_name is None:\n        object_name = file_path\n    try:\n        s3.upload_file(file_path, bucket_name, object_name)\n        print(f\"File {file_path} uploaded as {object_name}.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"The file was not found\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n```\n\n### Step 6: Delete a File from the Bucket\n\nTo delete a file, use the `delete_object` method.\n\n```python\ndef delete_file(bucket_name, object_name):\n    try:\n        s3.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_name)\n        print(f\"File {object_name} deleted.\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n```\n\n### Step 7: Main Function\n\nNow, let's put it all together in a main function where you can choose what operations to perform.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'\n    \n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. List files\")\n        print(\"2. Upload a file\")\n        print(\"3. Delete a file\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n        \n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        \n        if choice == '1':\n            list_files(bucket_name)\n        elif choice == '2':\n            file_path = input(\"Enter the path to the file you want to upload: \")\n            object_name = input(\"Enter the object name (optional): \") or None\n            upload_file(bucket_name, file_path, object_name)\n        elif choice == '3':\n            object_name = input(\"Enter the name of the object you want to delete: \")\n            delete_file(bucket_name, object_name)\n        elif choice == '4':\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **List Files**: Lists all objects in the specified S3 bucket.\n2. **Upload a File**: Uploads a local file to the specified S3 bucket with an optional object name.\n3. **Delete a File**: Deletes a specified object from the S3 bucket.\n4. **Main Function**: Provides a simple text menu for users to select operations.\n\nMake sure to replace `'your-bucket-name'` and `'your-region'` with your actual bucket name and region.\n\nThis script provides a basic interface to manage files in an S3 bucket. You can expand it further based on your requirements, such as handling pagination for large buckets or adding error handling for specific scenarios."
