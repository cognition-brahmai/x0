So in total, there are 9 fruits left on the table.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says I put back 2 oranges. Did I take any oranges away before that? The problem only mentions apples being taken away and oranges being put back. So initially, there were only apples on the table. Then I took away 3 apples, leaving 7 apples. Then I put back 2 oranges, so now there are 7 apples and 2 oranges, making 9 fruits in total.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe \"put back\" implies that I had taken away some oranges earlier, but the problem doesn't say that. It only says I took away apples and then put back oranges. So, starting with 10 apples, after taking away 3 apples, there are 7 apples. Then adding 2 oranges gives a total of 9 fruits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"put back\" means I had taken oranges earlier, but since the problem doesn't mention that, I think it's safe to assume that I'm adding 2 oranges to the table that previously had only apples.\n\nSo, my final answer is 9 fruits left on the table.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
