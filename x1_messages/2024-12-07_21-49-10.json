Each step of your plan should have corresponding evidence, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's query, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to use:\nSearchEngine[input]: A tool that allows you to search for information on the internet. This tool is useful in finding relevant websites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from a webpage link provided as input and produces a plain text output containing the content of the page.\nLinkLister[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response of links.\nInfoBot[input]: A question answering model that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g., What is the capital of France, given #E1?\n\nThe function input should be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., InfoBot[What is the height of Mount Everest, given #E3?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may reference previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who was the architect behind the design of the Sydney Opera House and what other notable buildings did they design?"
