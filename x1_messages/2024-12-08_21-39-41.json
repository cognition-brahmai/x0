        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the factory produces 500 units in 8 hours. First, I need to find out the production rate per hour. To do that, I'll divide the total units by the number of hours it takes to produce them.\n\nSo, production rate per hour = 500 units / 8 hours = 62.5 units per hour.\n\nNow, the factory operates for 12 hours a day. So, to find out how many units it can produce in one day, I'll multiply the hourly production rate by the number of hours it operates daily.\n\nDaily production = 62.5 units/hour * 12 hours = 750 units per day.\n\nFinally, to find out the production over 3 days, I'll multiply the daily production by 3.\n\nTotal production in 3 days = 750 units/day * 3 days = 2250 units.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a easier way to think about this. If the factory produces 500 units in 8 hours, how many units does it produce in 12 hours?\n\nLet me set up a proportion. If 8 hours correspond to 500 units, then 12 hours correspond to x units.\n\nSo, 8/500 = 12/x\n\nWait, actually, that should be 8 hours is to 500 units as 12 hours is to x units, so 8/500 = 12/x.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, it should be 8 hours : 500 units = 12 hours : x units, which means 8/500 = 12/x.\n\nBut actually, that's incorrect. It should be 8 hours produces 500 units, so 12 hours would produce (12/8)*500 units.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, x = (12/8)*500 = (1.5)*500 = 750 units per day.\n\nThen, over 3 days, it would be 750 units/day * 3 days = 2250 units.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the factory can produce 2250 units in 3 days if it operates 12 hours a day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2250} \\]"
