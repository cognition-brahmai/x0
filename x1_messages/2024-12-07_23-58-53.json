        "content": "Let's see. We have three friends: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Alice is older than Bob but younger than Carol. The sum of their ages is 90 years, and the difference between Alice's age and Bob's age is equal to the difference between Carol's age and Alice's age. I need to find out how old Alice is.\n\nFirst, I should assign variables to their ages to make it easier to work with equations. Let's say:\n\n- Let A be Alice's age.\n\n- Let B be Bob's age.\n\n- Let C be Carol's age.\n\nFrom the information given:\n\n1. Alice is older than Bob: A > B\n\n2. Alice is younger than Carol: A < C\n\n3. The sum of their ages is 90: A + B + C = 90\n\n4. The difference between Alice's age and Bob's age is equal to the difference between Carol's age and Alice's age: A - B = C - A\n\nLet me look at that fourth point again. It says that the difference between Alice's age and Bob's age is equal to the difference between Carol's age and Alice's age. So, A - B = C - A.\n\nI can rearrange that equation to solve for one of the variables. Let's see:\n\nA - B = C - A\n\nIf I add A to both sides:\n\n2A - B = C\n\nNow, I have an expression for C in terms of A and B.\n\nBut I have three variables and only two equations so far. I need another relationship to connect these variables.\n\nWait, I have the sum of their ages: A + B + C = 90.\n\nAnd I have C = 2A - B from the previous equation.\n\nI can substitute C in the sum equation:\n\nA + B + (2A - B) = 90\n\nSimplify that:\n\nA + B + 2A - B = 90\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n3A = 90\n\nSo, A = 30\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is that possible?\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf A = 30, then C = 2A - B = 60 - B\n\nAnd from the sum equation: 30 + B + (60 - B) = 90\n\nSimplify: 30 + B + 60 - B = 90\n\nWhich is 90 = 90, which checks out.\n\nBut I need to ensure that Alice is older than Bob and younger than Carol.\n\nSo, A > B and A < C.\n\nGiven A = 30 and C = 60 - B, then 30 < 60 - B, which simplifies to B < 30.\n\nAlso, A > B, which is 30 > B.\n\nSo, B < 30.\n\nTherefore, B can be any value less than 30, and C will be 60 - B, which will always be greater than 30 since B < 30.\n\nWait, but in that case, A is always 30, regardless of B's value, as long as B < 30.\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that there's a specific age for Alice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something in the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"There are three friends named Alice, Bob, and Carol. Alice is older than Bob but younger than Carol. If the sum of their ages is 90 years, and the difference between Alice's age and Bob's age is equal to the difference between Carol's age and Alice's age, how old is Alice?\"\n\nSo, from the equations, it seems that Alice is 30 years old.\n\nBut is there a way to confirm this?\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nGiven that the difference between Alice and Bob is equal to the difference between Carol and Alice, that means Alice is exactly in the middle in terms of age between Bob and Carol.\n\nSo, Alice is the median age among the three.\n\nGiven that, and that the sum of their ages is 90, perhaps the ages are equally spaced.\n\nIn other words, the ages form an arithmetic sequence with Alice being the middle term.\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n\nHere, the difference between Alice and Bob is equal to the difference between Carol and Alice, which fits the definition of an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, if the ages are in arithmetic progression, with Alice being the middle term, then the sum of the ages is 3 times the middle term.\n\nBecause in an arithmetic sequence, the sum of three terms is three times the middle term.\n\nSo, 3A = 90, which again gives A = 30.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, Alice is 30 years old.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are other possible interpretations.\n\nSuppose that the ages are not in an arithmetic sequence. However, given the condition that A - B = C - A, this directly implies that the ages are equally spaced around Alice's age, which is the definition of an arithmetic sequence.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is A = 30.\n\nAlternatively, if there were more information, such as a specific relationship between two of their ages, but in this case, with the given information, Alice must be 30 years old.\n\nSo, the answer is that Alice is 30 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
