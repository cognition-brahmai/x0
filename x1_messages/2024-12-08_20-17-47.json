        "content": "So, the school has 8 classrooms, and each classroom has 25 students. I need to find out how many students there are in total in the school. Hmm, this seems like a multiplication problem because I'm dealing with groups of the same size.\n\nFirst, I should understand what multiplication means in this context. Multiplication is basically repeated addition, right? So, if each classroom has 25 students, and there are 8 classrooms, then I can think of it as adding 25 eight times.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25\n\nThat's adding 25 eight times. But that might take a while to calculate manually, especially with larger numbers. That's why multiplication is a quicker way to do this.\n\nSo, instead of adding, I can multiply the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom:\n\n8 (classrooms) \u00d7 25 (students per classroom)\n\nNow, how do I multiply 8 by 25? I remember that 25 is a quarter of 100, and 100 is an easier number to work with.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 8 \u00d7 10 is 80, and 8 \u00d7 5 is 40, and 25 is 20 + 5, but wait, maybe that's complicating it.\n\nLet me think differently. I know that 10 \u00d7 25 is 250, and 8 is 10 minus 2, but that might not help directly.\n\nWait, another way: 25 is 20 plus 5, so I can multiply each part by 8 and then add them together.\n\nSo, 8 \u00d7 20 = 160\n\nAnd 8 \u00d7 5 = 40\n\nNow, add those together: 160 + 40 = 200\n\nSo, 8 \u00d7 25 = 200\n\nTherefore, there are 200 students in the school.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe I can use another method to confirm.\n\nAnother method: I can think of 25 as 100 divided by 4.\n\nSo, 8 \u00d7 (100 \u00f7 4) = (8 \u00d7 100) \u00f7 4 = 800 \u00f7 4 = 200\n\nOkay, that gives me the same answer, 200.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about place value. 25 is 2 tens and 5 ones. So, 8 \u00d7 2 tens is 16 tens, which is 160, and 8 \u00d7 5 ones is 40 ones, which is 40. Adding them together, 160 + 40 = 200.\n\nYet another way: I can use the distributive property. For example, 8 \u00d7 25 = (10 - 2) \u00d7 25 = (10 \u00d7 25) - (2 \u00d7 25) = 250 - 50 = 200\n\nWait, that's interesting. I get the same answer again, 200.\n\nLet me try one more way to be sure. Maybe I can add 25 eight times:\n\n25 + 25 = 50\n\n50 + 25 = 75\n\n75 + 25 = 100\n\n100 + 25 = 125\n\n125 + 25 = 150\n\n150 + 25 = 175\n\n175 + 25 = 200\n\nYes, again, 200.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 200 as the total number of students in the school.\n\nTherefore, the school has 200 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
