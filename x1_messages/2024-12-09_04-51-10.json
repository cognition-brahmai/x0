        "content": "So we have a committee with 5 members, and they need to elect a president, vice-president, and secretary. We need to figure out how many different ways these positions can be filled.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We have three distinct positions: president, vice-president, and secretary. We need to assign these positions to different members of the committee. Importantly, one person can't hold more than one position.\n\nSo, for the president position, we have 5 choices because there are 5 members.\n\nOnce the president is chosen, there are 4 remaining members to choose from for the vice-president position.\n\nAfter choosing the vice-president, there are 3 members left for the secretary position.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to fill these positions, we multiply the number of choices for each position together. So, it's 5 (for president) times 4 (for vice-president) times 3 (for secretary).\n\nLet me calculate that: 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that in permutations, where order matters, the formula is nP r = n! / (n - r)!, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 and r = 3, since we're choosing 3 positions from 5 members.\n\nSo, 5P3 = 5! / (5 - 3)! = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1) = (120) / (2) = 60.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it as the number of ways to arrange 3 members out of 5 in a specific order, which again is a permutation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for each position, the number of choices decreases by one because no one can hold more than one position.\n\nSo, for president: 5 choices.\n\nFor vice-president: 4 choices (since the president can't also be vice-president).\n\nFor secretary: 3 choices (since the president and vice-president are already chosen).\n\nMultiplying these together gives us 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose we first choose the three members who will hold the positions, and then assign the positions among them.\n\nFirst, choose 3 members out of 5. That's a combination, since the order doesn't matter yet. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! \u00d7 (n - r)!).\n\nSo, 5C3 = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / ((3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 1)) = (120) / (6 \u00d7 2) = 120 / 12 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose which 3 members will hold the positions.\n\nThen, for each of these 10 groups of 3 members, we need to assign the three distinct positions: president, vice-president, and secretary.\n\nThe number of ways to assign these positions is 3! (3 factorial), which is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, total number of ways is 10 (ways to choose the members) times 6 (ways to assign the positions), which is 60.\n\nAgain, we get 60, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both approaches confirm that there are 60 different ways to fill these positions.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any restriction or additional condition that we might have missed.\n\nThe problem states that the committee must elect a president, vice-president, and secretary from its members, and that these are distinct positions. It also implies that no one can hold more than one position, which we've already accounted for.\n\nThere's no mention of any member being unable to hold a specific position or any other constraints, so our calculation should be correct.\n\nMoreover, since the positions are distinct, the order in which we assign them matters, which is why we're using permutations and not combinations.\n\nIn summary, using both the permutation approach and the combination approach followed by arranging the positions, we arrive at the same answer of 60 different ways to fill the positions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
