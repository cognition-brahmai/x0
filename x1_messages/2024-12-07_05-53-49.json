        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangular room that's 12 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I need to cover the entire floor with carpet tiles that are each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters in size. I need to figure out how many of these tiles I'll need.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the area of the room and the area of one carpet tile. Then, I can divide the area of the room by the area of one tile to get the total number of tiles needed.\n\nSo, the area of the room is length times width, right? That would be 12 meters times 8 meters, which is 96 square meters.\n\nNow, each carpet tile is 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters, so the area of one tile is 0.5 times 0.5, which is 0.25 square meters.\n\nTo find out how many tiles I need, I divide the area of the room by the area of one tile: 96 divided by 0.25.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 96 divided by 0.25. Well, dividing by 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4, because 0.25 is a quarter. So, 96 times 4 is 384.\n\nSo, I need 384 tiles to cover the entire floor.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way could be to think about how many tiles fit along the length and how many fit along the width, then multiply those two numbers.\n\nThe room is 12 meters long, and each tile is 0.5 meters long, so the number of tiles along the length is 12 divided by 0.5, which is 24 tiles.\n\nSimilarly, the room is 8 meters wide, and each tile is 0.5 meters wide, so the number of tiles along the width is 8 divided by 0.5, which is 16 tiles.\n\nThen, the total number of tiles is 24 times 16.\n\nLet me calculate that: 24 times 16.\n\n24 times 10 is 240, and 24 times 6 is 144, so 240 plus 144 is 384.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I need 384 tiles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any waste or if tiles need to be cut to fit around the edges, but the problem doesn't mention that. It just asks for how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor, assuming perfect fitting without any waste.\n\nSo, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{384} \\]"
