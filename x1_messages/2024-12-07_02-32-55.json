        "content": "So the factory currently produces 500 units of product A every day. They want to increase production by 40% because of higher demand. I need to find out how many units they will produce daily after this increase.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 40% increase means. Percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. A 40% increase means they're adding 40% of the current production amount to the original amount.\n\nSo, I need to calculate 40% of 500 units and then add that to the original 500 units.\n\nLet me first find out what 40% of 500 is.\n\nI know that \"of\" in mathematics usually means multiplication, so 40% of 500 is the same as 40% multiplied by 500.\n\nBut percentages are fractions of 100, right? So 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.40.\n\nSo, 40% of 500 is 0.40 times 500.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 0.40 \u00d7 500 = 200.\n\nSo, the increase is 200 units.\n\nNow, to find the total production after the increase, I need to add this increase to the original production amount.\n\nThat is, 500 units + 200 units = 700 units.\n\nTherefore, after a 40% increase, the factory will produce 700 units of product A daily.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 500 units.\n\n40% of 500 is 0.4 \u00d7 500 = 200.\n\nAdding that to the original: 500 + 200 = 700.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the new amount by multiplying the original amount by (1 + the percentage increase in decimal form).\n\nSo, in this case, it would be 500 \u00d7 (1 + 0.40) = 500 \u00d7 1.40.\n\nLet me calculate that: 500 \u00d7 1.40 = 700.\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nI think 700 units is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose they say there's a 40% increase. Does that mean the production is multiplied by 1.40, or is there another interpretation?\n\nIn general, a percentage increase is added to the original amount. So, original amount plus the increase equals the new amount.\n\nWhich is what I did: 500 + (0.40 \u00d7 500) = 500 \u00d7 (1 + 0.40) = 700.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a multiplicative increase, like multiplying by 40%, that would be different, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 700 units is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]"
