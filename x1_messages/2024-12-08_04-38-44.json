        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The word is \"ORANGE,\" and we need to find out how many ways we can arrange its letters so that all the vowels stay together.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the vowels in \"ORANGE.\" The vowels are O, A, and E. The consonants are R, N, and G.\n\nSince the vowels must always appear together, I can think of them as a single unit or block. So, instead of having six separate letters to arrange, I have three consonants and one block of vowels. That means I have four units to arrange: the vowel block (OAE), R, N, and G.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these four units is 4 factorial, which is 4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nBut wait, within the vowel block, the vowels themselves can be arranged in different orders. The vowels are O, A, and E, and the number of ways to arrange these three vowels is 3 factorial, which is 3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nSo, for each of the 24 arrangements of the four units, there are 6 ways to arrange the vowels inside their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where the vowels are always together is 24 \u00d7 6 = 144.\n\nLet me just double-check that I haven't missed anything. The word \"ORANGE\" has six distinct letters, so the total number of possible arrangements without any restrictions would be 6! = 720. According to my calculation, the number of arrangements where vowels are together is 144.\n\nTo verify, I can also think of it differently. If I treat the vowels as a single unit, then I have four units to arrange: (OAE), R, N, G. As calculated, that's 4! = 24 ways. Then, within the vowel unit, the vowels can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. Multiplying them gives 24 \u00d7 6 = 144, which matches my previous result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the vowels as a single entity, and then arrange this entity along with the consonants. So, it's like arranging four items, which can be done in 4! ways, and then accounting for the internal arrangement of the vowels.\n\nI think this makes sense. So, the final answer should be 144 ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]"
