        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells books and magazines. Each book costs $15, and each magazine costs $5. The store sold a total of 60 items and made $600 in sales. We need to find out how many books and magazines were sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's use variables to represent the unknowns. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of books sold.\n\n- Let \\( m \\) represent the number of magazines sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items sold is 60.\n\n2. The total sales amount is $600.\n\nSo, we can translate these into equations.\n\nFirst equation: Total items sold\n\n\\[ b + m = 60 \\]\n\nSecond equation: Total sales\n\nSince each book sells for $15 and each magazine for $5, the total sales can be represented as:\n\n\\[ 15b + 5m = 600 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( b + m = 60 \\)\n\n2. \\( 15b + 5m = 600 \\)\n\nI think the best way to solve this is by using the substitution or elimination method. Let\u2019s try the elimination method first.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n\n\\[ b + m = 60 \\]  (Equation 1)\n\n\\[ 15b + 5m = 600 \\]  (Equation 2)\n\nI notice that Equation 2 can be simplified. Let\u2019s divide every term in Equation 2 by 5:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15b}{5} + \\frac{5m}{5} = \\frac{600}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ 3b + m = 120 \\]  (Equation 2 simplified)\n\nNow we have:\n\n1. \\( b + m = 60 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3b + m = 120 \\)\n\nTo eliminate \\( m \\), I can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n\\[ (3b + m) - (b + m) = 120 - 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 3b + m - b - m = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 2b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the number of books sold is 30.\n\nNow, plug this value back into Equation 1 to find \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ 30 + m = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 60 - 30 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the store sold 30 books and 30 magazines.\n\nWait a minute, let\u2019s check if this makes sense. If they sold 30 books at $15 each and 30 magazines at $5 each, let's see if the total sales add up to $600.\n\nCost of books: 30 books * $15/book = $450\n\nCost of magazines: 30 magazines * $5/magazine = $150\n\nTotal sales: $450 + $150 = $600\n\nYes, that matches the total sales given in the problem. So, our solution seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using ratios or other methods, but I think the system of equations is the most straightforward approach here.\n\nIt's also worth noting that sometimes problems like these can have multiple solutions, but in this case, since we have two equations and two variables, there should be a unique solution, which we've found.\n\nIn summary, the store sold 30 books and 30 magazines.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ books and } 30 \\text{ magazines}} \\]\n"
