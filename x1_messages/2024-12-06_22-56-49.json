        "content": "So, the car rental company has 200 cars, and they rent out 75% of them on a particular day. Each rented car brings in $50. We need to find out how much income the company generates that day.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many cars are rented out. Since they have 200 cars and rent out 75% of them, I can calculate the number of rented cars by multiplying 200 by 75%.\n\nBut, I should remember that 75% is the same as 0.75 in decimal form. So, the calculation would be:\n\nNumber of rented cars = 200 * 0.75\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n200 * 0.75 = 150 cars\n\nSo, 150 cars are rented out that day.\n\nNext, each rented car brings in $50. Therefore, to find the total income, I need to multiply the number of rented cars by the income per car.\n\nTotal income = Number of rented cars * Income per car\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal income = 150 * 50\n\nNow, let's do that multiplication:\n\n150 * 50 = 7500\n\nSo, the company generates $7500 in income that day.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Are there any additional costs or variables that might affect the total income? Based on the information provided, it seems like the only income comes from the rented cars at $50 each, and there's no mention of additional costs or fees.\n\nTherefore, the total income generated is $7500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7500} \\]"
