        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains traveling between Station A and Station B. The first train leaves Station A at 2:00 PM and arrives at Station B at 6:00 PM. The second train leaves Station B at 3:00 PM and arrives at Station A at 7:00 PM. Both trains are traveling at constant speeds. The question is asking whether they meet each other at the same time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the time each train takes to complete its journey.\n\nFor the first train:\n\n- Departure from A: 2:00 PM\n\n- Arrival at B: 6:00 PM\n\n- Travel time: 4 hours\n\nFor the second train:\n\n- Departure from B: 3:00 PM\n\n- Arrival at A: 7:00 PM\n\n- Travel time: 4 hours\n\nSo both trains take the same amount of time to travel between the stations, which is 4 hours.\n\nNext, I need to find out if they meet at the same time.\n\nLet me assume the distance between Station A and Station B is D kilometers.\n\nThen, the speed of the first train is:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nSpeed of first train (S1) = D / 4 km/h\n\nSimilarly, the speed of the second train (S2) = D / 4 km/h\n\nWait a minute, both trains have the same speed since they take the same time to cover the same distance.\n\nBut let's confirm that.\n\nIf both trains take 4 hours to cover distance D, then their speeds are equal.\n\nBut the question mentions \"both trains travel at constant speeds,\" but it doesn't specify if their speeds are the same or different.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, since both take the same time to cover the same distance, their speeds should be the same.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider that the speeds could be different if the distances or times are different.\n\nWait, no. If distance is the same and time is the same, then speed must be the same.\n\nBut let's think again.\n\nTrain 1: A to B in 4 hours.\n\nTrain 2: B to A in 4 hours.\n\nSo, S1 = D / 4\n\nS2 = D / 4\n\nTherefore, S1 = S2\n\nSo both trains have the same speed.\n\nNow, I need to find out when and where they meet.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system where Station A is at position 0 and Station B is at position D.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after 2:00 PM.\n\nSo, the position of Train 1 at time t is:\n\nP1(t) = S1 * t (since it's moving from A to B)\n\nTrain 2 leaves Station B at 3:00 PM, which is 1 hour after Train 1 leaves Station A.\n\nSo, the time elapsed since Train 2 leaves is (t - 1) hours.\n\nThe position of Train 2 at time t (for t >= 1) is:\n\nP2(t) = D - S2 * (t - 1) (since it's moving from B to A)\n\nNow, they meet when P1(t) = P2(t)\n\nSo,\n\nS1 * t = D - S2 * (t - 1)\n\nBut since S1 = S2 = D / 4,\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(D / 4) * t = D - (D / 4) * (t - 1)\n\nLet's solve for t:\n\n(D / 4) * t = D - (D / 4) * (t - 1)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate D:\n\nD * t = 4D - D * (t - 1)\n\nDivide both sides by D (assuming D != 0):\n\nt = 4 - (t - 1)\n\nt = 4 - t + 1\n\nt = 5 - t\n\nAdd t to both sides:\n\n2t = 5\n\nt = 2.5 hours\n\nSo, they meet at t = 2.5 hours after 2:00 PM.\n\nWhich is 2:00 PM + 2 hours and 30 minutes = 4:30 PM.\n\nNow, let's check the time according to Train 2's schedule.\n\nTrain 2 leaves at 3:00 PM, so the time elapsed since Train 2 leaves is t - 1 = 2.5 - 1 = 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, Train 2 has been traveling for 1.5 hours when they meet, which is at 4:30 PM.\n\nNow, does Train 2 also meet Train 1 at its own scheduled time?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nThe question is asking whether they meet each other at the same time according to their own schedules.\n\nBut according to our calculation, they meet at 4:30 PM, which is 2.5 hours after Train 1 leaves and 1.5 hours after Train 2 leaves.\n\nNow, is there a way they could be meeting at the same time according to their own schedules?\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding of the question.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"do they meet each other at the same time?\"\n\nI think this means, does the meeting time coincide with a specific time for both trains, like their departure or arrival times.\n\nBut according to our calculation, they meet at 4:30 PM, which is not their departure or arrival times.\n\nTrain 1 departs at 2:00 PM and arrives at 6:00 PM.\n\nTrain 2 departs at 3:00 PM and arrives at 7:00 PM.\n\nThey meet at 4:30 PM, which is between their departure and arrival times.\n\nBut I think the question might be interpreted as whether the time each train's clock shows is the same when they meet.\n\nBut since both trains are on the same time zone, their clocks should show the same time when they meet.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the time each train has been traveling when they meet.\n\nFor Train 1: 2.5 hours\n\nFor Train 2: 1.5 hours\n\nSo, the time each train has been traveling is different when they meet.\n\nBut the actual clock time when they meet is the same, which is 4:30 PM.\n\nSo, in that sense, they meet at the same time.\n\nI think the answer is yes, they meet at the same time, which is 4:30 PM.\n\nBut perhaps the question is trying to ask something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is whether the time each train has been traveling is the same when they meet.\n\nIn that case, the answer is no, since Train 1 has been traveling for 2.5 hours and Train 2 for 1.5 hours when they meet.\n\nBut based on the wording, \"do they meet each other at the same time?\", I think it refers to the clock time when they meet, which is the same for both trains.\n\nSo, yes, they meet at the same time, which is 4:30 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, they meet at the same time, which is 4:30 PM.}} \\]"
