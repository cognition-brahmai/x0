        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 15 cows and 9 goats. Each cow produces 3 gallons of milk per day, and each goat produces 1 gallon per day. I need to find out how much milk the farmer collects in a week.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the daily milk production from the cows and the goats separately, and then add them together to get the total daily production. After that, I can multiply the total daily production by 7 to get the weekly production.\n\nSo, starting with the cows: there are 15 cows, and each produces 3 gallons per day. So, 15 cows times 3 gallons per cow per day equals 45 gallons per day from the cows.\n\nNext, the goats: there are 9 goats, each producing 1 gallon per day. So, 9 goats times 1 gallon per goat per day equals 9 gallons per day from the goats.\n\nNow, to find the total daily milk production, I add the milk from the cows and the goats: 45 gallons plus 9 gallons equals 54 gallons per day.\n\nTo find the weekly production, I multiply the daily production by 7 days: 54 gallons per day times 7 days equals 378 gallons per week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total milk production per day from all animals and then multiply by 7.\n\nSo, total milk per day is (15 cows * 3 gallons/cow) + (9 goats * 1 gallon/goat) = (45) + (9) = 54 gallons per day.\n\nThen, 54 gallons per day * 7 days = 378 gallons per week.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the contribution of each type of animal over the week.\n\nFor the cows: 15 cows * 3 gallons/day * 7 days = 15 * 3 * 7 = 15 * 21 = 315 gallons per week.\n\nFor the goats: 9 goats * 1 gallon/day * 7 days = 9 * 1 * 7 = 63 gallons per week.\n\nThen, total milk per week is 315 + 63 = 378 gallons.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think 378 gallons per week is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{378} \\]"
