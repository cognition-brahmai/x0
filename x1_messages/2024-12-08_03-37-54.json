        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the company has an annual revenue of $500,000, and their expenses are 60% of that revenue. First, I need to find out what their current profit is.\n\nProfit is calculated as revenue minus expenses, right? So, if expenses are 60% of revenue, that means expenses are 0.60 times $500,000, which is $300,000. Therefore, the current profit is $500,000 minus $300,000, which equals $200,000.\n\nNow, the company wants to increase their profit by 20%. So, I need to find out what 20% of the current profit is and then add that to the current profit to find the target profit.\n\n20% of $200,000 is 0.20 times $200,000, which is $40,000. Therefore, the target profit is $200,000 plus $40,000, which equals $240,000.\n\nNext, I need to find out what the new revenue should be to achieve this target profit, assuming that the expense ratio remains the same at 60% of revenue.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the new revenue as R. Then, expenses will be 0.60R, and profit will be R minus 0.60R, which is 0.40R.\n\nWe set this equal to the target profit:\n\n0.40R = $240,000\n\nNow, solve for R:\n\nR = $240,000 / 0.40\n\nR = $600,000\n\nSo, the new revenue should be $600,000 to achieve a 20% increase in profit.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, if expenses remain at 60% of revenue, then profit is 40% of revenue. If they want a 20% increase in profit, that could also mean increasing the profit margin, but in this case, the problem specifies that expenses remain at 60% of revenue.\n\nSo, the first method seems correct. By increasing revenue to $600,000, with expenses at 60% of that (which is $360,000), the profit would be $600,000 minus $360,000, which is indeed $240,000, which is a 20% increase from the original $200,000 profit.\n\nAlternatively, if they could reduce expenses, they might not need to increase revenue as much, but the problem specifies that expenses remain at 60% of revenue, so I think $600,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600000} \\]"
