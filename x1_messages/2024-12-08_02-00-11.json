First, I need to calculate the numerator and the denominator separately, and then divide them.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 4^2 - 3 * 5.\n\n4^2 is 16, and 3 * 5 is 15. So, 16 - 15 equals 1.\n\nNow, the denominator: (2 + 1)^2.\n\n2 + 1 is 3, and 3^2 is 9.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 1 divided by 9, which is 1/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{9}} \\]"
