        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have four friends, and each one can choose from three different toppings: pepperoni, mushrooms, or olives. They can each pick any topping they like, and they don't have to choose the same one as their friends.\n\nSo, for each friend, there are three choices. Since their choices are independent of each other, meaning one friend's choice doesn't affect what another friend chooses, we can use the multiplication principle to find the total number of possible combinations.\n\nThe multiplication principle states that if there are n ways to do one thing, and m ways to do another, then there are n * m ways to do both. We can extend this to more than two events.\n\nIn this case, we have four friends, each with three choices. So, the total number of combinations would be:\n\n3 (choices for friend 1) * 3 (choices for friend 2) * 3 (choices for friend 3) * 3 (choices for friend 4) = 3^4 = 81\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If each friend has three choices, and there are four friends, then yes, 3 to the power of 4 is 81.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to think about it. Let's consider that each friend can choose any of the three toppings, and their choices are independent. So, for each friend, there are three possibilities.\n\nFriend 1: pepperoni, mushrooms, or olives\n\nFriend 2: pepperoni, mushrooms, or olives\n\nFriend 3: pepperoni, mushrooms, or olives\n\nFriend 4: pepperoni, mushrooms, or olives\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of combinations is the product of the number of choices for each friend.\n\nSo, 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as assigning a topping to each friend. For each friend, there are three possible toppings, and since there are four friends, it's 3^4 = 81.\n\nLet me consider if there's any restriction or condition that might change this calculation. The problem says that \"they don't have to pick the same one,\" which implies that they can choose different toppings, and that all friends can choose any topping independently.\n\nSo, there are no restrictions beyond that, meaning that all possible combinations are allowed.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out the possibilities, but that would be time-consuming given the number of combinations. For example:\n\n- All four choose pepperoni.\n\n- Three choose pepperoni, and one chooses mushrooms.\n\n- Three choose pepperoni, and one chooses olives.\n\n- Two choose pepperoni, and two choose mushrooms.\n\n- And so on, covering all possible combinations.\n\nBut listing them all out isn't necessary when we can use the multiplication principle.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether the order of the friends matters. In this problem, since they are four distinct friends, the order in which they make their choices doesn't matter; it's the combination of their choices that matters.\n\nSo, it's a question of combinations, not permutations, because the sequence of their choices isn't important; it's the overall set of choices they make.\n\nBut actually, since each friend is distinct, and they each make an independent choice, it is appropriate to use the multiplication principle directly.\n\nLet me consider a smaller case to verify. Suppose there are two friends and two toppings, say A and B.\n\nFriend 1: A or B\n\nFriend 2: A or B\n\nTotal combinations: AA, AB, BA, BB = 2^2 = 4, which makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, for three friends and two toppings: 2^3 = 8 combinations.\n\nSo, extending that, for four friends and three toppings: 3^4 = 81.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each friend choosing a topping, and the choices are multiplied together.\n\nAnother angle: if they all had to choose the same topping, then there would be only three possibilities: all pepperoni, all mushrooms, or all olives.\n\nBut in this problem, they can choose different toppings, so the number of combinations increases significantly.\n\nSo, yes, 81 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether toppings can be repeated. The problem doesn't say anything about not repeating toppings, so repetitions are allowed.\n\nFor example, two friends choosing pepperoni, one choosing mushrooms, and one choosing olives is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, all four choosing the same topping is also allowed.\n\nSince repetitions are allowed, the total number of combinations is indeed 3^4 = 81.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose we think of it as assigning a topping to each friend.\n\nFriend 1: 3 choices\n\nFriend 2: 3 choices\n\nFriend 3: 3 choices\n\nFriend 4: 3 choices\n\nTotal combinations: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of it in terms of combinations with repetition, the formula is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of types and r is the number of selections.\n\nBut in this case, since the friends are distinct, and the choices are independent, that formula doesn't directly apply.\n\nThe formula (n + r - 1) choose r is for indistinct objects, but here the friends are distinct, so the multiplication principle is more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible combinations of toppings is 81.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{81} \\]"
