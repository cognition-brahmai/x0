        "content": "To show that the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2 is continuous everywhere, we need to demonstrate that it is continuous at every point in its domain. Since f(x) is a polynomial function, its domain is all real numbers, meaning it's defined for every real number x.\n\nPolynomial functions are continuous everywhere by their nature because they are composed of terms with non-negative integer exponents, and such functions are continuous on the entire real line. However, to provide a more detailed explanation, let's recall the definition of continuity at a point and see how it applies to f(x).\n\nA function f is continuous at a point c if the following three conditions are met:\n\n1. f(c) is defined.\n\n2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches c exists.\n\n3. The limit of f(x) as x approaches c equals f(c).\n\nSince f(x) is a polynomial, it satisfies these conditions for all real numbers c. Let's see why:\n\n1. **f(c) is defined:** For any real number c, f(c) = c^3 - 3c + 2 is a real number because it's just arithmetic operations on real numbers.\n\n2. **The limit of f(x) as x approaches c exists:** Polynomial functions are smooth and without breaks, so the limit as x approaches c is simply the value of the function at c.\n\n3. **The limit equals f(c):** Again, because polynomial functions are continuous, the limit as x approaches c is f(c).\n\nTo further illustrate, let's consider the general property of limits for polynomials. If p(x) is a polynomial, then for any real number c,\n\nlim (x\u2192c) p(x) = p(c).\n\nThis is a fundamental property of polynomial functions, and it directly implies that all polynomial functions are continuous everywhere.\n\nIn conclusion, since f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2 is a polynomial function, it is continuous for all real numbers x."
