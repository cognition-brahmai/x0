        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A big hotel chain wants to build a resort on a tropical island with 500 rooms, divided into three types: standard, deluxe, and suites, with percentages of 60%, 30%, and 10% respectively. They want these rooms distributed evenly across five buildings. Also, there's a budget of $75 million for the entire project, with an average construction cost of $300 per square foot. I need to calculate the number of each type of room, distribute them evenly across the five buildings, and then figure out the size of each building based on the budget and construction costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of rooms in each category.\n\nTotal rooms: 500\n\nStandard rooms: 60% of 500\n\nDeluxe rooms: 30% of 500\n\nSuites: 10% of 500\n\nSo,\n\nStandard rooms = 0.60 * 500 = 300 rooms\n\nDeluxe rooms = 0.30 * 500 = 150 rooms\n\nSuites = 0.10 * 500 = 50 rooms\n\nNow, these need to be distributed evenly across five buildings. So, each building should have roughly the same number of each type of room.\n\nNumber of standard rooms per building: 300 / 5 = 60 rooms\n\nNumber of deluxe rooms per building: 150 / 5 = 30 rooms\n\nNumber of suites per building: 50 / 5 = 10 rooms\n\nSo, each building will have 60 standard rooms, 30 deluxe rooms, and 10 suites.\n\nNext, I need to determine the size of each building based on the construction cost and the total budget.\n\nTotal budget: $75,000,000\n\nConstruction cost: $300 per square foot\n\nFirst, let's find out the total square footage that can be built with the budget.\n\nTotal square footage = Total budget / Construction cost per square foot\n\nTotal square footage = $75,000,000 / $300 per sq ft\n\nTotal square footage = 250,000 sq ft\n\nNow, this is for the entire project, which includes all five buildings. So, to find the size of each building, I need to divide this total square footage by the number of buildings.\n\nSize per building = Total square footage / Number of buildings\n\nSize per building = 250,000 sq ft / 5\n\nSize per building = 50,000 sq ft\n\nSo, each building should be approximately 50,000 square feet in size.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should consider if this square footage includes only room space or if it includes other areas like lobbies, restaurants, pools, etc. The problem doesn't specify whether the square footage is just for the rooms or includes all areas of the building. If it's only for the rooms, I would need to know the average size per room type to verify if this distribution is possible.\n\nHowever, since the problem mentions an average construction cost per square foot for the entire project, it's likely that the total square footage includes all areas, not just the rooms. Therefore, the distribution of room types across the buildings is independent of the building sizes, as the building size is determined by the total budget and construction cost, not by the number of rooms.\n\nSo, my building distribution plan is as follows:\n\n- There will be five buildings, each with a size of 50,000 square feet.\n\n- Each building will contain:\n\n- 60 standard rooms\n\n- 30 deluxe rooms\n\n- 10 suites\n\nThis ensures that the rooms are distributed evenly across all five buildings.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other constraints or requirements, such as parking, common areas, or environmental considerations, but based on the information provided, this seems to be a straightforward distribution.\n\nOne thing to note is that in reality, hotel designs consider various factors like guest flow, services, and amenities, but given the scope of this problem, the focus is on room distribution and building sizes within the budget constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50,000 \\text{ square feet per building}} \\]"
