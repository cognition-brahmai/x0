        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that connects to a Redis database, fetches all keys that start with \"user:\", and then prints out the total number of users along with their names and ages. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to make sure I have Redis installed and running somewhere. For the sake of this example, I'll assume that Redis is running locally on the default port, which is 6379. If it's on a different host or port, I can adjust the connection settings later.\n\nNext, I need to connect to the Redis database using Python. To do that, I'll need to use the redis-py library, which is the Python client for Redis. I should check if this library is already installed; if not, I'll need to install it using pip.\n\nSo, the first step is to install the redis-py library if it's not already available. I can do this by running:\n\n```bash\npip install redis\n```\n\nOnce that's installed, I can start writing the Python script.\n\nI need to import the `redis` module and connect to the Redis server. Assuming it's running locally on the default port, the connection code would look like this:\n\n```python\nimport redis\n\n# Connect to Redis\nr = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)\n```\n\nNow, I need to retrieve all keys that start with \"user:\". Redis has a `keys` method that can return all keys matching a specified pattern. So, I can use that with the pattern \"user:*\".\n\n```python\nkeys = r.keys(\"user:*\")\n```\n\nOnce I have all the keys, I need to fetch the data for each user. Assuming that each user's data is stored in a hash, where the key is \"user:<some_id>\" and the hash fields are \"name\" and \"age\", I can use the `hgetall` method to retrieve all fields and values for each user.\n\nSo, for each key in the list of keys, I'll do:\n\n```python\nuser_data = r.hgetall(key)\n```\n\nSince `hgetall` returns a dictionary-like object with bytes as keys and values, I need to decode them to strings.\n\n```python\nuser_data = {k.decode('utf-8'): v.decode('utf-8') for k, v in user_data.items()}\n```\n\nThen, I can extract the \"name\" and \"age\" from this dictionary.\n\n```python\nname = user_data.get('name', 'N/A')\nage = user_data.get('age', 'N/A')\n```\n\nI'll collect all user data into a list or some other data structure, and finally, print the total number of users and their details.\n\nPutting it all together, the script might look like this:\n\n```python\nimport redis\n\ndef main():\n    # Connect to Redis\n    r = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)\n    \n    # Retrieve all keys starting with \"user:\"\n    keys = r.keys(\"user:*\")\n    \n    # List to hold user data\n    users = []\n    \n    # Fetch data for each user\n    for key in keys:\n        user_data = r.hgetall(key)\n        decoded_data = {k.decode('utf-8'): v.decode('utf-8') for k, v in user_data.items()}\n        name = decoded_data.get('name', 'N/A')\n        age = decoded_data.get('age', 'N/A')\n        users.append({'name': name, 'age': age})\n    \n    # Print total number of users\n    print(f\"Total users: {len(users)}\")\n    \n    # Print each user's name and age\n    for user in users:\n        print(f\"Name: {user['name']}, Age: {user['age']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nBefore running this script, I need to make sure that the Redis database contains some user data in the expected format. For example, I might have keys like \"user:1\", \"user:2\", etc., each containing hash fields \"name\" and \"age\".\n\nTo test this, I can manually add some users to Redis using the Redis CLI or any Redis client.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nredis-cli\n127.0.0.1:6379> hset user:1 name \"Alice\" age \"30\"\n127.0.0.1:6379> hset user:2 name \"Bob\" age \"25\"\n127.0.0.1:6379> hset user:3 name \"Charlie\" age \"35\"\n```\n\nThen, running the Python script should retrieve these users and print their names and ages, along with the total count.\n\nThat should do it! This script connects to Redis, retrieves the user keys, fetches the user data, decodes it, and prints the required information.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo accomplish the task of connecting to a Redis database, retrieving all keys starting with \"user:\", and printing the total number of users along with their names and ages, you can use the following Python script. This script uses the `redis-py` library to interact with Redis.\n\nFirst, ensure that the `redis` library is installed:\n\n```bash\npip install redis\n```\n\nThen, use the following script:\n\n```python\nimport redis\n\ndef main():\n    # Connect to Redis\n    r = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)\n    \n    # Retrieve all keys starting with \"user:\"\n    keys = r.keys(\"user:*\")\n    \n    # List to hold user data\n    users = []\n    \n    # Fetch data for each user\n    for key in keys:\n        user_data = r.hgetall(key)\n        decoded_data = {k.decode('utf-8'): v.decode('utf-8') for k, v in user_data.items()}\n        name = decoded_data.get('name', 'N/A')\n        age = decoded_data.get('age', 'N/A')\n        users.append({'name': name, 'age': age})\n    \n    # Print total number of users\n    print(f\"Total users: {len(users)}\")\n    \n    # Print each user's name and age\n    for user in users:\n        print(f\"Name: {user['name']}, Age: {user['age']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connecting to Redis:** The script connects to a local Redis server running on the default port (6379). Adjust the `host` and `port` parameters if your Redis server is configured differently.\n\n2. **Retrieving Keys:** It fetches all keys that start with \"user:\" using the `keys` method with the pattern \"user:*\".\n\n3. **Fetching User Data:** For each retrieved key, it fetches the hash data using `hgetall`, decodes the byte responses to strings, and extracts the 'name' and 'age' fields.\n\n4. **Printing Results:** It prints the total number of users and iterates through the list of users to print each user's name and age.\n\nEnsure that your Redis database contains the appropriate user data in the expected format for this script to work correctly."
