        "content": "To find the slope of the line passing through two points, (2, 4) and (6, 12), we can use the slope formula. The slope (m) of a line through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\]\n\nHere, the coordinates of the first point are \\( (x_1, y_1) = (2, 4) \\) and the second point are \\( (x_2, y_2) = (6, 12) \\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{12 - 4}{6 - 2} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the slope of the line passing through the points (2, 4) and (6, 12) is 2.\n\nTo understand this better, slope represents the steepness of the line. A positive slope means the line rises as we move from left to right, which is the case here since the slope is 2. This indicates that for every unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units.\n\nWe can also verify this by checking another pair of points on the same line. For instance, if we have another point on this line, say (4, 8), applying the slope formula between (2,4) and (4,8):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{8 - 4}{4 - 2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\]\n\nSimilarly, between (6,12) and (4,8):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{8 - 12}{4 - 6} = \\frac{-4}{-2} = 2 \\]\n\nThis consistency confirms that the slope of the line is indeed 2.\n\nAdditionally, the slope can be interpreted as the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between any two points on the line. In this case, moving from (2,4) to (6,12), the rise is 8 units (from 4 to 12) and the run is 4 units (from 2 to 6), giving a slope of \\( \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\).\n\nIt's also worth noting that if we were to plot these points on a graph and draw a straight line through them, the slope would visually represent how tilted the line is. A slope of 2 means the line is fairly steep, rising quickly as we move to the right.\n\nIn summary, using the slope formula and understanding its meaning, we've determined that the slope of the line passing through the points (2,4) and (6,12) is 2."
