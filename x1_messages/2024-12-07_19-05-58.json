        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular room that measures 12 feet by 15 feet, and I need to figure out how many square yards of carpet are needed to cover the entire floor. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the area of the room in square feet because that will tell me how much space the carpet needs to cover. The room is rectangular, so the area is just length times width. The length is 15 feet and the width is 12 feet, so:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 15 feet \u00d7 12 feet = 180 square feet.\n\nOkay, so the room is 180 square feet. But the carpet is measured in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards. Hmm, I remember that 1 yard equals 3 feet, but since we're dealing with area, I need to think about square yards and square feet.\n\nLet me think about this. If 1 yard is 3 feet, then 1 square yard is 3 feet \u00d7 3 feet, which is 9 square feet. So, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet.\n\nNow, to find out how many square yards are in 180 square feet, I can divide the total square feet by the number of square feet in one square yard:\n\nNumber of square yards = total square feet / square feet per square yard = 180 square feet / 9 square feet per square yard = 20 square yards.\n\nSo, it seems like I need 20 square yards of carpet to cover the entire floor.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps I can convert the dimensions from feet to yards first and then calculate the area in square yards.\n\nAlright, so 1 yard = 3 feet. Therefore, to convert feet to yards, I divide by 3.\n\nThe length is 15 feet, so in yards:\n\n15 feet \u00f7 3 = 5 yards.\n\nThe width is 12 feet, so in yards:\n\n12 feet \u00f7 3 = 4 yards.\n\nNow, the area in square yards is length in yards times width in yards:\n\nArea = 5 yards \u00d7 4 yards = 20 square yards.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, indeed, I need 20 square yards of carpet.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like waste or padding. But the problem just asks for the amount needed to cover the entire floor, so I think 20 square yards is the straightforward answer.\n\nOne more thing: sometimes rooms aren't perfectly rectangular, or there might be obstacles, but in this case, it's a straightforward rectangular room, so no need to complicate things.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's redo the math quickly.\n\nFirst method:\n\nArea in square feet: 15 \u00d7 12 = 180 square feet.\n\nConvert to square yards: 180 \u00f7 9 = 20 square yards.\n\nSecond method:\n\nConvert feet to yards: 15 \u00f7 3 = 5 yards, 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 yards.\n\nArea in square yards: 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 square yards.\n\nBoth methods give the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. The answer is 20 square yards of carpet are needed to cover the entire floor of the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
