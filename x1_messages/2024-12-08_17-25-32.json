FINN: The mysterious fishmonger with a suspicious smile.\n- MRS. FELICIA FELDMAN: The worried owner of the missing cat.\n\n(Scene: A bustling fish market. Mr. Finn is behind his stall, arranging a colorful display of fish. DEX and LU enter, both looking slightly out of place among the seafood.)\n\nDEX: (Sighs) Another day, another missing pet case. Why do I always get stuck with these?\n\nLU: (Cheerfully) Because you're the best, Dex! And besides, this could be the case that finally proves we make a great team!\n\nDEX: (Rolls eyes) Yeah, right. Our last partnership ended with you locking me in the evidence room.\n\nLU: (Laughs) That was one time, and it was an accident! Besides, we solved the case, didn't we?\n\nDEX: (Muttering) Barely.\n\n(LU spots Mr. Finn and walks over to him, DEX trailing behind reluctantly.)\n\nLU: Excuse me, Mr. Finn? We're detectives Dogwood and Laughlin. We're here about the missing cat.\n\nMR. FINN: (Smiling politely) Ah, yes. Mrs. Feldman's precious Fluffy. I've been meaning to help, but I just don't know where to start.\n\nDEX: (Skeptical) You don't seem too concerned.\n\nMR. FINN: (Defensive) I care about all animals, detective. But I'm just not sure how I can assist.\n\nLU: Well, perhaps you've seen something unusual around here lately? Any fishy characters, perhaps?\n\nMR. FINN: (Chuckles) Fishy characters? Now that is a funny one. No, nothing out of the ordinary, I assure you.\n\nDEX: (Looking around) This place is a maze. It'd be easy for someone to hide something... or someone.\n\nLU: (Whispering to DEX) Or in this case, a cat.\n\nDEX: (Whispering back) Let's split up. You check the storage area; I'll question the locals.\n\nLU: (Nods) Good plan, partner.\n\n(They split up. LU heads towards a storage area, while DEX approaches some nearby fish sellers.)\n\nDEX: (To a seller) Excuse me, have you seen anything suspicious lately?\n\nSELLER: (Shrugs) Not really, detective. Everything's been pretty normal here.\n\nDEX: (Inspects a tank of fish) These look healthy. No signs of... well, anything unusual.\n\nSELLER: (Nods) Yep, all good here.\n\n(DEX moves on to another seller.)\n\nDEX: (To another seller) Anything out of the ordinary?\n\nSECOND SELLER: (Whispers) Actually, there have been some strange noises coming from Mr. Finn's storage area at night.\n\nDEX: (Raises an eyebrow) Strange noises? Like what?\n\nSECOND SELLER: (Whispers) Meowing, maybe? But I could be wrong.\n\nDEX: (Nods) Thanks for the info.\n\n(DEX makes a mental note and heads back towards Mr. Finn's stall.)\n\nMeanwhile, LU is searching the storage area.\n\nLU: (Looking around) Hmm, this place is a mess. Where to start?\n\n(She hears a faint meowing sound.)\n\nLU: (Follows the sound) Fluffy?\n\n(She finds a small, hidden compartment and opens it to reveal a bunch of cat toys and a note.)\n\nLU: (Reads the note) \"Found a stray cat. Will take care of it. -F.\"\n\nLU: (Smiles) Maybe Fluffy got lost and ended up here.\n\n(She takes a photo of the note and the toys with her phone.)\n\nSuddenly, MR. FINN appears behind her.\n\nMR. FINN: (Startled) What are you doing back here?\n\nLU: (Jumps, then smiles) Oh, Mr. Finn! Just looking for clues. You know, the usual.\n\nMR. FINN: (Nervous) Clues? Well, I hope you find what you're looking for.\n\nLU: (Notices his nervousness) Is there something you're not telling us, Mr. Finn?\n\nMR. FINN: (Sweats) No, no, nothing at all. I just... I really care about animals, and I want to help find Fluffy.\n\nDEX: (Enters, having heard the exchange) Mr. Finn, can you explain why there are cat toys in your storage area?\n\nMR. FINN: (Stammers) Oh, those? Those are for my... um... cat adoption program. I sometimes take in strays and find them homes.\n\nLU: (Looks skeptical) Really? I didn't know you did that.\n\nMR. FINN: (Nods) Yes, it's a small way to give back to the community.\n\nDEX: (Pulls out the note) And what about this note? \"Found a stray cat. Will take care of it. -F.\"\n\nMR. FINN: (Pauses) That must be from when I found a stray a few weeks ago. I took it in and found it a new home.\n\nLU: (Curious) And Fluffy? Do you know anything about her?\n\nMR. FINN: (Shakes head) I'm afraid not. I haven't seen her around here.\n\nDEX: (Skeptical) We'll need to see your records of the cats you've taken in.\n\nMR. FINN: (Nervous) Records? Well, I don't really keep formal records. It's more of a informal thing.\n\nLU: (Smiles sweetly) Oh, that's okay. We're sure you've been doing a great job.\n\nDEX: (More sternly) But for now, we need to confirm if Fluffy was ever in your possession.\n\nMR. FINN: (Defensive) I assure you, detective, I haven't seen Fluffy. If I did, I would have returned her immediately.\n\nDEX: (Nods) We'll need to check this out further.\n\n(LU looks at DEX, then back at MR. FINN.)\n\nLU: (Cheerfully) Well, thanks for your cooperation, Mr. Finn. We'll be in touch.\n\nMR. FINN: (Relieved) Of course, detectives. Good day.\n\n(DEX and LU exit the storage area, discussing.)\n\nDEX: I don't trust him. There's something off about that fishmonger.\n\nLU: (Thinks) Maybe, but we need more evidence. Let's talk to Mrs. Feldman again.\n\nDEX: (Agrees) Yeah, see if she remembers if Fluffy was acting strangely before going missing.\n\n(LU and DEX exit the fish market, heading towards Mrs. Feldman's house.)\n\n(End of Scene)\n\n**Notes:**\n- This scene sets up a light-hearted mystery with two contrasting detectives trying to solve a missing cat case.\n- The inclusion of a mysterious fishmonger adds an element of intrigue and potential suspicion.\n- The use of humor and puns, especially through LU's character, aims to keep the scene entertaining.\n- The scene leaves room for further development and potential twists in subsequent acts."
