        "content": "So, you're asking about the probability of drawing three red cards in a row from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and you're drawing them one at a time without putting them back. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, it's important to know that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into two colors: red and black. The red cards are hearts and diamonds, and the black cards are spades and clubs. So, there are 26 red cards and 26 black cards.\n\nSince we're drawing without replacement, each card we draw affects the probabilities for the next draw. So, we need to calculate the probability step by step for each draw.\n\nLet's start with the first draw:\n\n1. **First card:** The probability that the first card is red.\n\nThere are 26 red cards out of 52 total cards.\n\nSo, P(First red) = 26/52 = 1/2.\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, for the second draw:\n\n2. **Second card:** Given that the first card was red, what's the probability that the second card is also red?\n\nSince we didn't replace the first card, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, and 25 of them are red.\n\nSo, P(Second red | First red) = 25/51.\n\nSimilarly, for the third draw:\n\n3. **Third card:** Given that the first two cards were red, what's the probability that the third card is also red?\n\nNow, there are 50 cards left in the deck, and 24 of them are red.\n\nSo, P(Third red | First two red) = 24/50 = 12/25.\n\nTo find the overall probability of all three events happening in sequence (drawing three red cards in a row without replacement), we need to multiply these probabilities together:\n\nP(Three reds) = P(First red) \u00d7 P(Second red | First red) \u00d7 P(Third red | First two red)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nP(Three reds) = (1/2) \u00d7 (25/51) \u00d7 (12/25)\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 1/2 by 25/51:\n\n(1/2) \u00d7 (25/51) = 25/(2\u00d751) = 25/102\n\nNow, multiply that by 12/25:\n\n(25/102) \u00d7 (12/25) = (25 \u00d7 12) / (102 \u00d7 25)\n\nThe 25s cancel out:\n\n12 / 102 = 2 / 17\n\nSo, the probability is 2/17.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting again:\n\nP(Three reds) = (1/2) \u00d7 (25/51) \u00d7 (12/25)\n\nFirst, (1/2) \u00d7 (25/51) = 25/102\n\nThen, 25/102 \u00d7 12/25 = (25 \u00d7 12) / (102 \u00d7 25) = 12/102 = 2/17\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 red cards out of 26 is C(26,3), and the total number of ways to choose any 3 cards out of 52 is C(52,3).\n\nSo, P(Three reds) = C(26,3) / C(52,3)\n\nLet's calculate that to verify.\n\nC(26,3) = 26! / (3! \u00d7 (26-3)!) = (26 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 24) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (26 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 24) / 6 = (15600) / 6 = 2600\n\nC(52,3) = 52! / (3! \u00d7 (52-3)!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50) / 6 = (132600) / 6 = 22100\n\nSo, P(Three reds) = 2600 / 22100 = 26/221 = 2/17\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing three red cards in a row without replacement is 2/17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{17}} \\]"
