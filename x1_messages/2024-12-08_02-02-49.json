        "content": "To determine the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two six-sided dice, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**\n   Each die has 6 faces, and since the dice are rolled independently, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**\n   We need to find all the pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a\\) is the result of the first die, \\(b\\) is the result of the second die, and \\(a + b = 7\\). Let's list all such pairs:\n   - \\((1, 6)\\)\n   - \\((2, 5)\\)\n   - \\((3, 4)\\)\n   - \\((4, 3)\\)\n   - \\((5, 2)\\)\n   - \\((6, 1)\\)\n   \n   There are 6 such pairs.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability:**\n   The probability \\(P\\) of rolling a sum of 7 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two six-sided dice is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\\)."
