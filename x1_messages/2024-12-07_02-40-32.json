        "content": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. There are 8 red balls and 12 blue balls in a box, making a total of 20 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing one red and one blue ball without looking, and without replacement, I assume, since it's drawing two balls one after the other.\n\nFirst, I should recall the formula for probability. Probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is drawing one red and one blue ball.\n\nBut, I need to be careful about the order in which I draw the balls. Does the order matter here? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll consider both scenarios: drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball, and drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball. Since the problem is about drawing \"one red and one blue ball,\" the order shouldn't matter, but I need to account for both possibilities.\n\nLet me first calculate the probability of drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 8/20, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nAfter drawing a red ball, there are now 19 balls left in the box, with 12 of them being blue. So, the probability of drawing a blue ball next is 12/19.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball is (2/5) * (12/19).\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue ball first is 12/20, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nAfter drawing a blue ball, there are now 19 balls left, with 8 of them being red. So, the probability of drawing a red ball next is 8/19.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball is (3/5) * (8/19).\n\nSince both sequences (red then blue, and blue then red) result in one red and one blue ball, I need to add these two probabilities together to get the total probability.\n\nSo, total probability = (2/5 * 12/19) + (3/5 * 8/19).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 2/5 * 12/19 = (2*12)/(5*19) = 24/95.\n\nSecond, 3/5 * 8/19 = (3*8)/(5*19) = 24/95.\n\nNow, adding them together: 24/95 + 24/95 = 48/95.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing one red and one blue ball is 48/95.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using combinations?\n\nYes, I can use combinations to calculate the probability without concerning about the order.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 20 is C(20,2), which is 20 choose 2.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to draw 1 red out of 8 and 1 blue out of 12 is C(8,1) * C(12,1).\n\nSo, the probability is [C(8,1) * C(12,1)] / C(20,2).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nC(8,1) = 8\n\nC(12,1) = 12\n\nC(20,2) = (20*19)/2 = 190\n\nSo, probability = (8 * 12) / 190 = 96 / 190 = 48 / 95\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 48/95.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of permutations.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls from 20 is 20*19 = 380, considering order.\n\nThe number of ways to draw one red and one blue is:\n\n- Red first, then blue: 8 * 12 = 96\n\n- Blue first, then red: 12 * 8 = 96\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes = 96 + 96 = 192\n\nTherefore, probability = 192 / 380 = 48 / 95\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The probability is 48/95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{48}{95}} \\]"
