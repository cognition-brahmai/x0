        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is:\n\n((7 - 3)^2 * (5 / 4) + 6) - 2 * 8 + 9\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n7 - 3 = 4\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n(4^2 * (5 / 4) + 6) - 2 * 8 + 9\n\nNext, I'll handle the exponent:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow it's:\n\n(16 * (5 / 4) + 6) - 2 * 8 + 9\n\nNext, handle the division inside the parentheses:\n\n5 / 4 = 1.25\n\nNow it's:\n\n(16 * 1.25 + 6) - 2 * 8 + 9\n\nNow, multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n16 * 1.25 = 20\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(20 + 6) - 2 * 8 + 9\n\nAddition inside the parentheses:\n\n20 + 6 = 26\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n26 - 2 * 8 + 9\n\nNext, handle the multiplication:\n\n2 * 8 = 16\n\nSo now it's:\n\n26 - 16 + 9\n\nNow, perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:\n\n26 - 16 = 10\n\nThen, 10 + 9 = 19\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 19.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
