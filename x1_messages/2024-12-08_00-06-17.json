        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total, and 18 of them are boys. So, the rest must be girls. To find out how many girls there are, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\nGirls = Total students - Boys\nGirls = 30 - 18\nGirls = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 girls in the class.\n\nNow, half of the boys wear glasses. Since there are 18 boys, half of them would be:\n\nHalf of boys = 18 / 2\nHalf of boys = 9\n\nSo, 9 boys wear glasses.\n\nNext, two-thirds of the girls wear glasses. With 12 girls in total, two-thirds would be:\n\nTwo-thirds of girls = (2/3) * 12\nTwo-thirds of girls = 8\n\nSo, 8 girls wear glasses.\n\nTo find the total number of students who wear glasses, I'll add the number of boys and girls who wear glasses:\n\nTotal wearing glasses = Boys wearing glasses + Girls wearing glasses\nTotal wearing glasses = 9 + 8\nTotal wearing glasses = 17\n\nTherefore, 17 students in total wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
