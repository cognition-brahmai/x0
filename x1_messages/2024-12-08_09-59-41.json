        "content": "So the store is having a sale on shirts, and they're offering a 25% discount off the original price. The original price of the shirt is $40, and I need to find out what the new price will be after the discount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 25% discount means. Percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. So, 25% means 25 per 100, or in other words, 25/100, which is the same as 0.25 in decimal form.\n\nSo, to find out how much the discount is in dollars, I need to calculate 25% of $40. That should be 0.25 multiplied by 40.\n\nLet me do that: 0.25 times 40 is 10. So, the discount is $10.\n\nNow, to find the new price after the discount, I need to subtract the discount from the original price. So, $40 minus $10 should give me the sale price.\n\n40 - 10 equals 30. So, the new price of the shirt after the discount is $30.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the percentage discount is 25%, which is 0.25 in decimal form. Multiplying that by the original price of $40 gives me $10 discount.\n\nSubtracting $10 from $40 gives me $30. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate what percentage of the original price I have to pay after the discount. If it's a 25% discount, that means I'm paying 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, 75% of $40 should also give me the sale price.\n\nLet me calculate that to verify. 75% is 0.75 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 0.75 times 40 is 30. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with $30 as the new price after the discount.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Percent discounts are pretty common in stores, so it's good to know how to calculate them.\n\nJust to make sure I understand it fully, let's consider another example. Suppose the original price is $100, and the discount is 20%. What would be the new price?\n\nFirst, calculate the discount amount: 20% of $100 is 0.20 times 100, which is $20.\n\nThen, subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $20 = $80.\n\nAlternatively, calculate 80% of $100, since 100% - 20% = 80%. So, 0.80 times 100 is $80.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, $40 minus 25% discount is $30.\n\nI feel confident about that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
