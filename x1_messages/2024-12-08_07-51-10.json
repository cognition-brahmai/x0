        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nA factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and 5% of them are defective. So, out of 1000 widgets, 5% are defective. That means:\n\nDefective widgets = 5% of 1000 = 0.05 * 1000 = 50 widgets.\n\nNon-defective widgets = 1000 - 50 = 950 widgets.\n\nNow, an inspector randomly selects 10 widgets from the production line. I need to find the probability that at least one of these selected widgets is defective.\n\nOkay, probability of at least one defective widget in a sample of 10.\n\nHmm, \"at least one\" often in probability means it's easier to find the complement, which is the probability of none being defective, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, P(at least one defective) = 1 - P(None are defective).\n\nThat seems like a good approach.\n\nFirst, find P(None are defective).\n\nThe total number of ways to select 10 widgets out of 1000 is C(1000, 10), where C is the combination formula.\n\nThe number of ways to select 10 non-defective widgets out of 950 is C(950, 10).\n\nTherefore, P(None are defective) = C(950, 10) / C(1000, 10).\n\nThen, P(at least one defective) = 1 - [C(950, 10) / C(1000, 10)].\n\nAlternatively, since the pool is large (1000), and we're sampling 10 without replacement, I could use the hypergeometric distribution formula.\n\nYes, this is a hypergeometric distribution problem.\n\nJust to recall, the hypergeometric distribution is used when sampling without replacement from a finite population.\n\nThe formula for the hypergeometric probability is:\n\nP(X=k) = [C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\nN = population size (1000)\n\nK = number of success states in the population (defective widgets, 50)\n\nn = number of draws (10)\n\nk = number of observed successes (defective widgets in sample)\n\nIn this case, I want P(X >=1), which is 1 - P(X=0).\n\nSo, P(X>=1) = 1 - P(X=0).\n\nNow, P(X=0) = [C(50, 0) * C(950, 10)] / C(1000, 10).\n\nC(50, 0) = 1, since choosing 0 out of 50 is 1 way.\n\nSo, P(X=0) = [1 * C(950, 10)] / C(1000, 10).\n\nTherefore, P(X>=1) = 1 - [C(950, 10) / C(1000, 10)].\n\nNow, I need to compute this value.\n\nBut calculating combinations with such large numbers can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximation for hypergeometric distribution when the population is large.\n\nIn such cases, the hypergeometric distribution can be approximated by the binomial distribution.\n\nThe binomial distribution has parameters n and p, where n is the number of trials (samples), and p is the probability of success on each trial.\n\nHere, n = 10, and p = probability of a widget being defective = 5% or 0.05.\n\nSo, using the binomial distribution, P(X >=1) = 1 - P(X=0).\n\nP(X=0) in binomial is (1-p)^n = (0.95)^10.\n\nTherefore, P(X>=1) = 1 - (0.95)^10.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 0.95^10.\n\n0.95^10 is approximately 0.59874.\n\nTherefore, P(X>=1) = 1 - 0.59874 = 0.40126.\n\nSo, approximately 40.13%.\n\nBut wait, this is an approximation.\n\nThe exact value using the hypergeometric distribution might be slightly different.\n\nBut given the large population size relative to the sample size, this should be a pretty good approximation.\n\nAlternatively, to get a more exact value, I could use the hypergeometric formula.\n\nBut calculating C(950,10) and C(1000,10) directly is impractical due to the large factorials involved.\n\nInstead, I can use the definition of combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nBut again, factorials of large numbers are hard to compute directly.\n\nA better way is to use the hypergeometric cumulative distribution function.\n\nAlternatively, I can use statistical software or a calculator with hypergeometric functions.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, the binomial approximation is acceptable.\n\nMoreover, in many practical applications, especially when the population is large and the sample size is small relative to the population, the binomial approximation is used for simplicity.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with the binomial approximation.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the selected widgets is defective is approximately 40.13%.\n\nLet me box that as the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.4013} \\]\n\n**Step-by-step**\n\n1. **Identify the problem**: Find the probability that at least one of the 10 randomly selected widgets is defective, given that 5% of 1000 widgets are defective.\n   \n2. **Determine the number of defective and non-defective widgets**:\n   - Defective widgets: \\( 5\\% \\) of 1000 = 50\n   - Non-defective widgets: 1000 - 50 = 950\n\n3. **Use the complement rule**: \n   \\[\n   P(\\text{at least one defective}) = 1 - P(\\text{none are defective})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Hypergeometric distribution approach**:\n   - Total ways to select 10 widgets from 1000: \\( \\binom{1000}{10} \\)\n   - Ways to select 10 non-defective widgets from 950: \\( \\binom{950}{10} \\)\n   - Thus, \\( P(\\text{none are defective}) = \\frac{\\binom{950}{10}}{\\binom{1000}{10}} \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( P(\\text{at least one defective}) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{950}{10}}{\\binom{1000}{10}} \\)\n\n5. **Binomial approximation**:\n   - For large populations and small sample sizes, use binomial distribution with \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( p = 0.05 \\)\n   - \\( P(\\text{none are defective}) = (1 - p)^n = (0.95)^{10} \\)\n   - Calculate \\( (0.95)^{10} \\approx 0.59874 \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( P(\\text{at least one defective}) = 1 - 0.59874 = 0.40126 \\)\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The probability is approximately \\( 40.13\\% \\), or \\( 0.4013 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.4013} \\]"
