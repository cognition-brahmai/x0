She is the goddess of wisdom, courage, inspiration, civilization, law and justice, strategic warfare, mathematics, strength, strategy, the arts, crafts, and skill. As for the brand of olive oil, I'm not sure about that part, but perhaps it's a reference to Athenos or another brand name inspired by Greek mythology."
