        "content": "So I've got this problem here about allocating funds for a new sports complex in a city. The city has a budget of $50 million, and they want to build facilities for different sports based on how popular each sport is among the residents. They've got data on the number of participants in each sport and the average cost per facility for those sports. My task is to figure out how many facilities for each sport they can build within the budget while keeping things fair or equitable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"equitable distribution of resources\" means in this context. Equitable doesn't necessarily mean equal; it might mean that the allocation should consider the popularity of each sport, so sports with more participants get more facilities, but maybe not strictly proportional to the number of participants. Perhaps it's about providing enough access for everyone, considering the cost per user or something like that.\n\nI should probably start by looking at the data they have. They've collected the number of participants in each sport and the average cost per facility for each sport. Let's assume they have a list of sports, say, soccer, basketball, tennis, swimming, etc., with corresponding participant numbers and facility costs.\n\nFor example, let's\u5047\u5b9a some hypothetical numbers to work with:\n\n- Soccer: 10,000 participants, $2 million per facility\n\n- Basketball: 8,000 participants, $1.5 million per facility\n\n- Tennis: 5,000 participants, $1 million per facility\n\n- Swimming: 12,000 participants, $3 million per facility\n\nThese are just made-up numbers to illustrate the process.\n\nNow, one way to approach this is to calculate some sort of efficiency metric for each sport, like the cost per participant per facility. This would tell us how much each facility benefits the participants in terms of cost.\n\nFor soccer:\n\n- Cost per facility: $2 million\n\n- Participants: 10,000\n\n- Cost per participant per facility: $2,000,000 / 10,000 = $200 per participant\n\nFor basketball:\n\n- Cost per facility: $1.5 million\n\n- Participants: 8,000\n\n- Cost per participant per facility: $1,500,000 / 8,000 = $187.50 per participant\n\nFor tennis:\n\n- Cost per facility: $1 million\n\n- Participants: 5,000\n\n- Cost per participant per facility: $1,000,000 / 5,000 = $200 per participant\n\nFor swimming:\n\n- Cost per facility: $3 million\n\n- Participants: 12,000\n\n- Cost per participant per facility: $3,000,000 / 12,000 = $250 per participant\n\nLooking at this, basketball seems to be the most cost-effective in terms of cost per participant per facility, followed by soccer and tennis, and then swimming is the least cost-effective.\n\nBut, we need to think about equity. Just going by cost-effectiveness might not be fair to sports with more participants or those that are more important to the community.\n\nAnother approach could be to allocate facilities based on the proportion of participants in each sport relative to the total participants.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of participants across all sports.\n\nTotal participants = 10,000 (soccer) + 8,000 (basketball) + 5,000 (tennis) + 12,000 (swimming) = 35,000\n\nNow, calculate the proportion for each sport:\n\n- Soccer: 10,000 / 35,000 = 0.2857 or 28.57%\n\n- Basketball: 8,000 / 35,000 = 0.2286 or 22.86%\n\n- Tennis: 5,000 / 35,000 = 0.1429 or 14.29%\n\n- Swimming: 12,000 / 35,000 = 0.3429 or 34.29%\n\nNow, allocate the budget based on these proportions.\n\nTotal budget: $50 million\n\n- Soccer: 28.57% of $50 million = 0.2857 * 50,000,000 = $14,285,000\n\n- Basketball: 22.86% of $50 million = 0.2286 * 50,000,000 = $11,430,000\n\n- Tennis: 14.29% of $50 million = 0.1429 * 50,000,000 = $7,145,000\n\n- Swimming: 34.29% of $50 million = 0.3429 * 50,000,000 = $17,140,000\n\nNow, divide these allocated amounts by the cost per facility for each sport to find out how many facilities can be built.\n\n- Soccer: $14,285,000 / $2,000,000 \u2248 7.14, so 7 facilities\n\n- Basketball: $11,430,000 / $1,500,000 \u2248 7.62, so 7 facilities\n\n- Tennis: $7,145,000 / $1,000,000 \u2248 7.145, so 7 facilities\n\n- Swimming: $17,140,000 / $3,000,000 \u2248 5.71, so 5 facilities\n\nBut wait, if we add up the costs:\n\n- Soccer: 7 * $2,000,000 = $14,000,000\n\n- Basketball: 7 * $1,500,000 = $10,500,000\n\n- Tennis: 7 * $1,000,000 = $7,000,000\n\n- Swimming: 5 * $3,000,000 = $15,000,000\n\nTotal allocated: $14,000,000 + $10,500,000 + $7,000,000 + $15,000,000 = $46,500,000\n\nSo, there's $50,000,000 - $46,500,000 = $3,500,000 left.\n\nHow to allocate the remaining money equitably?\n\nOne way is to look at the remaining fractions of the facilities that weren't built and see which sport has the highest remaining fraction.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Soccer: wanted 7.14, built 7, remaining 0.14\n\n- Basketball: 7.62, built 7, remaining 0.62\n\n- Tennis: 7.145, built 7, remaining 0.145\n\n- Swimming: 5.71, built 5, remaining 0.71\n\nSo, swimming has the highest remaining fraction (0.71), followed by basketball (0.62), then soccer and tennis with lower fractions.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to allocate the remaining money to swimming first, then basketball, and so on.\n\nSwimming's next facility costs $3,000,000, but we only have $3,500,000 left. So, we can build one more swimming facility.\n\nNow, total allocated:\n\n- Swimming: 5 + 1 = 6 facilities, costing $18,000,000\n\n- Soccer: 7 facilities, $14,000,000\n\n- Basketball: 7 facilities, $10,500,000\n\n- Tennis: 7 facilities, $7,000,000\n\nTotal: $18,000,000 + $14,000,000 + $10,500,000 + $7,000,000 = $49,500,000\n\nStill have $500,000 left.\n\nNow, look at the next highest remaining fraction, which is basketball with 0.62.\n\nBasketball's next facility costs $1,500,000, but we only have $500,000 left, which isn't enough. So, we can't build another basketball facility.\n\nPerhaps we can partial fund it, but since we're dealing with whole facilities, that might not be practical.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at which sport can get the most benefit from the remaining $500,000.\n\nLooking at the cost per participant for each sport:\n\n- Soccer: $200 per participant\n\n- Basketball: $187.50 per participant\n\n- Tennis: $200 per participant\n\n- Swimming: $250 per participant\n\nBasketball has the lowest cost per participant, meaning that allocating to basketball would benefit more participants per dollar spent.\n\nHowever, since $500,000 is not enough to build another basketball facility, which costs $1.5 million, perhaps we can consider partial funding or investing in something else, like maintenance, or smaller facilities.\n\nBut, since the problem is about building whole facilities, maybe it's best to leave that $500,000 unallocated or set it aside for future use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city can look into shared facilities or multi-use facilities that can serve multiple sports, but that's getting into more complex planning.\n\nAnother consideration is the actual space required for each facility. Maybe some sports require more land, which could be a limiting factor besides the budget.\n\nBut based on the information given, and focusing on the budget allocation, the above seems a reasonable approach.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Allocate the budget based on the proportion of participants in each sport.\n\n- Calculate the number of facilities for each sport based on the allocated budget and the cost per facility.\n\n- Allocate any remaining funds to the sport with the highest remaining fraction of desired facilities, provided there's enough money for another whole facility.\n\n- If not, leave the remaining money unallocated or find another use that benefits the sports complex as a whole.\n\nThis approach tries to balance popularity and cost-effectiveness while staying within the budget.\n\n**Final Allocation:**\n\n- Soccer: 7 facilities\n\n- Basketball: 7 facilities\n\n- Tennis: 7 facilities\n\n- Swimming: 6 facilities\n\n**Total Cost:** $49,500,000\n\n**Remaining Budget:** $500,000\n\n**Recommendation:** Leave the remaining $500,000 for maintenance or future expansions.\n\n**Note:** The hypothetical numbers used in this example should be replaced with the actual data provided by the city for precise calculations."
