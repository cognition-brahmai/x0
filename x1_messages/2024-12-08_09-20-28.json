        "content": "Given the user input \"Filter out rows from the CSV where the 'status' column equals 'inactive'\", the most suitable function from the available options is `csv_analytics`. This function is designed to handle operations on CSV data, including filtering based on specific conditions.\n\nTo accomplish the task of filtering rows where the 'status' column equals 'inactive', we need to specify the action as \"filter\" and define the filter criteria accordingly.\n\nHere's how we can structure the parameters for the `csv_analytics` function:\n\n- **action**: \"filter\" - This specifies that we want to filter the CSV data based on certain conditions.\n\n- **filters**:\n\n  - **column**: \"status\" - This indicates the column in the CSV file that we want to apply the filter to.\n\n  - **value**: \"inactive\" - This is the specific value we are filtering for in the 'status' column.\n\nBy using these parameters, the `csv_analytics` function will process the CSV data and return only the rows where the 'status' column has the value 'inactive'.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"csv_analytics\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"action\": \"filter\",\n    \"filters\": {\n      \"column\": \"status\",\n      \"value\": \"inactive\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object clearly identifies the function to be used and provides the necessary parameters to perform the desired filtering operation on the CSV data."
