        "content": "So there's this problem here. In a class of 30 students, 60% of them play soccer, and 40% of those who play soccer also play basketball. I need to find out how many students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many students play soccer. Since 60% of the 30 students play soccer, I can calculate that by multiplying 30 by 60%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky. I remember that to find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply. So, 60% is 0.60 in decimal form. So, 30 multiplied by 0.60 should give me the number of students who play soccer.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 30 times 0.60. That's 18 students play soccer.\n\nNow, out of these 18 students who play soccer, 40% of them also play basketball. Again, I need to find 40% of 18.\n\nSimilarly, 40% as a decimal is 0.40. So, 18 multiplied by 0.40 should give me the number of students who play both soccer and basketball.\n\nCalculating 18 times 0.40: 18 times 0.40 is 7.2.\n\nBut wait, I can't have 7.2 students. That doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a student. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. First, 60% of 30 students play soccer. 60% of 30 is indeed 18 students.\n\nThen, 40% of those 18 students also play basketball. 40% of 18 is 7.2, but since we're dealing with people, it should be a whole number.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem or in my approach. Maybe the class has 30 students, and the percentages don't lead to whole numbers, but that seems unusual.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the percentages are approximate, and the actual numbers are rounded. So, perhaps 60% of 30 is exactly 18, and 40% of 18 is 7.2, which I could round to 7 students.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct way to approach it. Maybe I should consider that the problem expects me to work with exact numbers and that percents are just a way to express parts of the whole.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the class has 30 students, and the percentages are meant to correspond to whole numbers only.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think in terms of fractions. 60% is equivalent to 3/5, and 40% is equivalent to 2/5.\n\nSo, 60% of 30 is 3/5 of 30, which is 18 students, as I calculated before.\n\nThen, 40% of 18 is 2/5 of 18. Let's see: 2/5 of 18 is (2/5)*18 = 36/5 = 7.2.\n\nAgain, I end up with 7.2, which is not a whole number.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to round to the nearest whole number, so 7.2 would round to 7 students.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's acceptable to have a fraction of a student in theoretical calculations, but in reality, it doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem is just to demonstrate the calculation process, and the fractional result is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and the numbers should be such that percentages result in whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the percentages are based on different totals.\n\nWait, the problem says 60% of 30 students play soccer, and then 40% of those who play soccer also play basketball.\n\nSo, the first step is correctly calculating 60% of 30, which is 18 students.\n\nThen, 40% of those 18 students play basketball as well.\n\nSo, 40% of 18 is 7.2.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to accept that 7.2 students play both sports, understanding that in reality, it's not possible, but for the sake of the exercise, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the class has a different number of students, but the problem specifies 30.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the class has 30 students, and the percentages are exact only if the numbers work out to whole students.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to illustrate that percentages don't always result in whole numbers, which can be a reality in statistics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the way I'm calculating the percentages.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can use proportions.\n\nIf 60% of 30 students play soccer, then the number of students who play soccer is (60/100)*30 = 18.\n\nThen, 40% of those 18 students also play basketball, so (40/100)*18 = 7.2.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nPerhaps I can think of it as a Venn diagram, where there are students who play only soccer, only basketball, and both.\n\nBut I don't have information about students who play only basketball or neither sport.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the number of students who play both sports is 7.2, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, perhaps the problem is hypothetical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the class has 30 students, and due to rounding, the numbers work out to whole students.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to interpret 7.2 as 7 students.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 40% of 18 is not 7.2, but maybe I miscalculated.\n\nLet me calculate 40% of 18 again. 40% is 0.4, and 0.4 times 18 is 7.2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a ratio. If 40% of soccer players play basketball, then for every 10 soccer players, 4 play basketball.\n\nSo, if there are 18 soccer players, then the number of students who play both is (4/10)*18 = 7.2.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nPerhaps the problem is designed to have a fractional answer to illustrate a point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the class actually has a different number of students to make the percentages work out to whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the number of students who play both sports is 7 or 8, but that would be speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be solved with algebra.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet total students = 30.\n\nLet students who play soccer = S.\n\nGiven that S = 60% of 30 = 0.6*30 = 18.\n\nLet students who play both soccer and basketball = B.\n\nGiven that B = 40% of S = 0.4*18 = 7.2.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem provides additional information that I'm missing, but from the problem statement, that's all the information given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be interpreted differently, such as overlapping percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the percentage of the class that plays both sports.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the number of students who play both sports.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to recognize that the number is 7.2, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, the answer is undefined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be approached using probability.\n\nIf I consider selecting a student at random, the probability that they play soccer is 60%, and given that they play soccer, the probability that they also play basketball is 40%.\n\nSo, the joint probability that a student plays both soccer and basketball is 60% times 40%, which is 24%.\n\nTherefore, 24% of the class plays both sports.\n\nSo, 24% of 30 students is 0.24*30 = 7.2.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the number of students who play both sports, accepting that the answer may not be a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the class actually has a number of students that makes the calculations work out to whole numbers, but the problem specifies 30 students.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be solved using sets and Venn diagrams, but without more information, that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that the number is not a whole number, indicating an inconsistency in the data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved by assuming that the percentages are approximate, and the answer should be rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nIn that case, 7.2 would round to 7 students.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to leave the answer as 7.2 students, understanding that in reality, it's not possible, but for the sake of the exercise, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself, and the numbers are not chosen appropriately to result in whole students.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the class has 30 students, and due to overlapping memberships in soccer and basketball, the numbers work out to fractions, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved using proportional reasoning.\n\nIf 60% of students play soccer, and 40% of those play basketball, then the proportion of the class that plays both is 0.6*0.4=0.24, or 24%.\n\nSo, 24% of 30 is 7.2.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved by setting up equations based on the given percentages.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet total students = 30.\n\nLet students who play soccer = S = 0.6*30 = 18.\n\nLet students who play both soccer and basketball = B = 0.4*S = 0.4*18 = 7.2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved using the inclusion-exclusion principle, but I don't have information about students who play basketball only or neither sport.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to accept that the answer is 7.2 students, understanding that in reality, it's not possible, but for the sake of mathematical exercise, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to interpret the percentages as fractions and calculate accordingly.\n\nSo, 60% is 3/5, and 40% is 2/5.\n\nSo, S = (3/5)*30 = 18.\n\nThen, B = (2/5)*18 = 7.2.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved by assuming that the number of students who play both sports is a whole number, and adjust the percentages accordingly.\n\nBut that seems like altering the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to highlight the importance of whole numbers in real-world scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved by recognizing that the number of students who play both sports is 7 or 8, based on rounding.\n\nBut again, that seems speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved by accepting that sometimes mathematical models don't result in whole numbers, and that's acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information and calculations, the number of students who play both soccer and basketball is 7.2.\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a student, in reality, this would need to be rounded or reconsidered, but according to the problem, the answer is 7.2 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.2} \\]"
