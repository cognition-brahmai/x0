        "content": "Ah, you're referring to Billy Joel, often called \"The Piano Man.\" His 1973 album \"Piano Man\" was indeed a significant release that brought him widespread recognition, but it's worth noting that his self-titled album was released in 1971. That album, \"Billy Joel,\" laid some groundwork for his career, but it was \"Piano Man\" that truly catapulted him to stardom. His piano skills and songwriting talent were highlighted in both albums, making him a household name in the 1970s and beyond."
