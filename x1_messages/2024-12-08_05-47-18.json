        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 people in a room, and each person knows exactly 3 other people there. We need to figure out how many handshakes happen if each person shakes hands with everyone they know.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Each person knows exactly 3 others, so that means each person will shake hands with those 3 people.\n\nSo, if there are 10 people, and each shakes hands with 3 others, you might think to just multiply 10 by 3 to get 30 handshakes. But that can't be right because each handshake involves two people. So, if person A shakes hands with person B, that's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, counting it as 30 would be double-counting each handshake.\n\nTherefore, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, I need to divide that 30 by 2. That would give me 15 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, but is that correct? Let me think about this again.\n\nIn graph theory, this situation can be represented as a graph where each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. So, we have a graph with 10 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of 3, meaning each is connected to 3 other vertices.\n\nThe handshakes correspond to the edges of this graph. There's a formula in graph theory that says the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. That makes sense because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nSo, sum of degrees = 2 * number of edges.\n\nIn this case, sum of degrees is 10 people times 3 degrees each, which is 30. Therefore, 30 = 2 * number of edges, which means the number of edges is 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 handshakes.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Suppose we have a smaller number of people to see if this logic holds.\n\nLet's say there are 4 people, and each knows 2 others. So, sum of degrees is 4 * 2 = 8, and number of edges is 8 / 2 = 4. In this case, it would be a cycle where each person knows two others, and there are indeed 4 handshakes.\n\nAnother example: 6 people, each knows 3 others. Sum of degrees is 18, number of edges is 9. Does that make sense? Well, in a hexagon, if each person knows two others, that would be 6 handshakes, but here each knows three others, which would perhaps be a different configuration, but the formula still holds.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, with 10 people each knowing 3 others, the number of handshakes should be (10 * 3) / 2 = 15.\n\nWait, but is there any other factor to consider? Is there a possibility of overlapping connections that might affect this calculation?\n\nFor example, if person A knows person B, and person B knows person C, and person C knows person A, that forms a triangle. In such a case, the handshakes are still just the edges of the triangle: A-B, B-C, and C-A. So, 3 handshakes, which matches the formula: (3 * 2) / 2 = 3.\n\nSo, it seems the formula holds even in cases of overlapping connections.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that there are 15 handshakes in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
