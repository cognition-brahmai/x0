        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 20 employees, and their average salary is $60,000 per year. That means if you add up all their salaries and divide by 20, you get $60,000.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total salary amount for all employees before the raise. Since the average is $60,000 for 20 people, I can calculate the total salary by multiplying the average by the number of employees:\n\nTotal salary before raise = average salary \u00d7 number of employees = $60,000 \u00d7 20 = $1,200,000.\n\nNow, one employee gets a raise of $10,000. So, the total salary will increase by $10,000.\n\nTotal salary after raise = total salary before raise + raise = $1,200,000 + $10,000 = $1,210,000.\n\nThe number of employees stays the same, which is 20. So, to find the new average salary, I need to divide the new total salary by the number of employees:\n\nNew average salary = total salary after raise \u00f7 number of employees = $1,210,000 \u00f7 20.\n\nLet me do that division: $1,210,000 \u00f7 20 = $60,500.\n\nSo, the new average salary for all employees after the raise is $60,500 per year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a shorter way to think about this. The average salary is the total salary divided by the number of employees. If one employee gets a raise of $10,000, that adds $10,000 to the total salary. Since the number of employees is 20, the average will increase by $10,000 divided by 20.\n\nIncrease in average = raise \u00f7 number of employees = $10,000 \u00f7 20 = $500.\n\nSo, the average salary increases by $500 from the original $60,000 to $60,500. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider that only one employee's salary increased by $10,000, and the others' salaries stayed the same. So, the total increase is indeed $10,000, and dividing that by 20 employees gives an increase of $500 per employee in the average.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the sum of the salaries, initially, it's $1,200,000. After the raise, it's $1,210,000. The difference is $10,000, which again, when divided by 20, gives $500 per employee in the average.\n\nI think this makes sense. So, the new average salary is $60,500 per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60500} \\]"
