You know your own degrees: sit down. At first And last the hearty welcome.\nLORDS. Thanks to your majesty.\nMACBETH. Ourself will mingle with society, And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state; but, in best time, We will require her welcome.\nLADY MACBETH. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends; For my heart speaks they are welcome.\nMACBETH. See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.-- Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:\n[Enter first Murderer to the door.]\nBe large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure The table round.--There's blood upon thy face.\nMURDERER. 'Tis Banquo's then.\nMACBETH. 'Tis better thee without than he within. Is he despatch'd?\nMURDERER. My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.\nMACBETH. Thou art the best o' the cut-throats; yet he's good That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it, Thou art the nonpareil.\nMURDERER. Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scap'd.\nMACBETH. Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect; Whole as the marble, founded as the rock; As broad and general as the casing air: But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?\nMURDERER. Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenched gashes on his head; The least a death to nature.\nMACBETH. Thanks for that: There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed, No teeth for the present.--Get thee gone; to-morrow We'll hear, ourselves, again.\n[Exit Murderer.]\nLADY MACBETH. My royal lord, You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making, 'Tis given with welcome; to feed were best at home; From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.\nMACBETH. Sweet remembrancer!-- Now, good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both!\nLENNOX. May't please your highness sit.\n[The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth's place.]\nMACBETH. Here had we now our country's honor roof'd, Were the grac'd person of our Banquo present; Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance!\nROSS. His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness To grace us with your royal company?\nMACBETH. The table's full.\nLENNOX. Here is a place reserv'd, sir.\nMACBETH. Where?\nLENNOX. Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?\nMACBETH. Which of you have done this?\nLORDS. What, my good lord?\nMACBETH. Thou canst not say I did it: never shake Thy gory locks at me.\nROSS. Gentlemen, rise; his highness is not well.\nLADY MACBETH. Sit, worthy friends:--my lord is often thus, And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat; The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well: if much you note him, You shall offend him, and extend his passion: Feed, and regard him not.--Are you a man?\nMACBETH. Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appal the devil.\nLADY MACBETH. O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear: This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said, Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts,-- Impostors to true fear,--would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire, Authoriz'd by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all's done, You look but on a stool.\nMACBETH. Pr'ythee, see there! behold! look! lo! how say you?-- Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.-- If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites.\n[Ghost disappears.]\nLADY MACBETH. What, quite unmann'd in folly?\nMACBETH. If I stand here, I saw him.\nLADY MACBETH. Fie, for shame!\nMACBETH. Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, Ere humane statute purg'd the gentle weal; Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd Too terrible for the ear: the time has been, That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, And push us from our stools: this is more strange Than such a murder is.\nLADY MACBETH. My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you.\nMACBETH. I do forget:-- Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends; I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. Come, love and health to all; Then I'll sit down.--Give me some wine, fill full.-- I drink to the general joy o' the whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss: Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst, And all to all.\nLORDS. Our duties, and the pledge.\n[Ghost rises again.]\nMACBETH. Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with!\nLADY MACBETH. Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other, Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.\nMACBETH. What man dare, I dare: Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble: or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword; If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mockery, hence!\n[Ghost disappears.]\nWhy, so;--being gone, I am a man again.--Pray you, sit still.\nLADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admir'd disorder.\nMACBETH. Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer's cloud, Without our special wonder? You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine are blanch'd with fear.\nROSS. What sights, my lord?\nLADY MACBETH. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him: at once, good-night:-- Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once.\nLENNOX. Good-night; and better health Attend his majesty!\nLADY MACBETH. A kind good-night to all!\n[Exeunt all Lords and Atendants.]\nMACBETH. It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood: Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak; Augurs, and understood relations, have By magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth The secret'st man of blood.--What is the night?\nLADY MACBETH. Almost at odds with morning, which is which.\nMACBETH. How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding?\nLADY MACBETH. Did you send to him, sir?\nMACBETH. I hear it by the way; but I will send: There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow, (And betimes I will) to the weird sisters: More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good, All causes shall give way: I am in blood Step't in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er: Strange things I have in head, that will to hand; Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.\nLADY MACBETH. You lack the season of all natures, sleep.\nMACBETH. Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:-- We are yet but young in deed.\n[Exeunt.]\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 520 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

        "content": "I've read through this scene from Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" and I need to summarize it in about 520 words. Let me see. This is Act 3, Scene 4, right? It takes place in a room of state in the palace, where a banquet is being held. Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, some lords, and attendants are present.\n\nSo, Macbeth starts by welcoming everyone and asking them to take their seats according to their ranks. He says he'll mix with the guests and be a humble host, while his hostess, Lady Macbeth, maintains her dignity. He mentions that they'll ask for her welcome later. Lady Macbeth agrees, telling him to announce it for her to all their friends, as her heart says they're welcome.\n\nThen, Macbeth spots the first murderer at the door. He asks if Banquo is dispatched, and the murderer confirms that Banquo is dead, with his throat cut and multiple gashes on his head. Macbeth is pleased but expresses concern that Fleance escaped. He calls the murderer the best of cutthroats and considers Fleance a threat, as he could breed venom like a worm that will grow into a serpent. Macbeth dismisses the murderer, planning to hear more details tomorrow.\n\nMeanwhile, Lady Macbeth notices that Macbeth isn't hosting properly, not offering the usual welcomes and toasts. She points out that the feast is being sold short without the proper ceremony. Macbeth then makes a toast, wishing good digestion and health to all.\n\nAs they're about to sit down, the ghost of Banquo appears and sits in Macbeth's place. Macbeth sees the ghost and asks who among the guests has done this, implying some kind of supernatural or malicious act. The guests are confused and ask what's wrong. Macbeth addresses the ghost, saying it can't blame him for Banquo's death and tells it to leave him alone.\n\nLady Macbeth tries to cover for him, telling the guests that Macbeth is often like this due to a flaw in his mind that he's had since youth. She urges them to ignore it and continue eating, assuring them that it's just a momentary fit.\n\nMacbeth, however, is fixated on the ghost and demands to know why it appears before him. He tells the ghost to leave and not to upset him. The ghost disappears, and Lady Macbeth scolds Macbeth for disrupting the banquet.\n\nMacbeth then tries to regain composure, offering another toast to their absent friend Banquo and to all their guests. He drinks to their health and happiness.\n\nBut then, the ghost reappears, and Macbeth again commands it to leave, calling it a horrible shadow and an unreal mockery. The ghost disappears again, and Macbeth claims that now he's a man again.\n\nLady Macbeth again apologizes for Macbeth's behavior, blaming it on his infirmity, and urges the guests to stay and enjoy the evening. But the lords are uneasy and take their leave, wishing Macbeth better health.\n\nOnce the guests have left, Macbeth ponders the idea that blood demands blood, recalling superstitions about stones moving and trees speaking, and how augurs interpret signs from birds like magpies, choughs, and rooks to predict bloody events.\n\nMacbeth asks Lady Macbeth if she's heard that Macduff refused to attend his bidding. She confirms that he did send for Macduff, and Macbeth plans to send again, perhaps hinting at more sinister intentions.\n\nMacbeth decides that tomorrow he will visit the witches again to seek more knowledge, even if it means using the worst means to find out the worst possible outcomes. He's resolute in pursuing his goals, despite the bloodshed, feeling that he's already too deep into it to turn back.\n\nLady Macbeth observes that he lacks the calmness that comes with sleep, implying that his conscience is troubling him. Macbeth agrees to go to sleep and reflects that his abnormal fear is due to lack of practice in evil deeds; he feels they are still inexperienced in murder.\n\nThat sums up the scene. It's intense, with themes of guilt, paranoia, and the supernatural interfering with reality. Macbeth's mental state is clearly deteriorating, and Lady Macbeth is struggling to maintain appearances. The banquet, which should be a celebration of their power, turns into a chaotic display of Macbeth's inner turmoil.\n\n**Final Summary (520 words):**\n\nIn Act 3, Scene 4 of Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" a banquet is held in the palace, attended by Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, several lords, and attendants. Macbeth welcomes his guests and plans to mingle as a humble host while Lady Macbeth maintains her dignity. He inquires about Banquo's death from a murderer, learning that Banquo is dead but Fleance has escaped, which disturbs him.\n\nDuring the banquet, the ghost of Banquo appears to Macbeth, visible only to him, causing him to behave erratically. He questions his guests about the ghost and addresses it directly, which confuses and alarms the attendees. Lady Macbeth attempts to cover for Macbeth's behavior, attributing it to a mental infirmity and urging the guests to ignore his outbursts and continue enjoying the feast. However, the ghost reappears, leading to another disturbance, and the guests eventually take their leave, concerned for Macbeth's well-being.\n\nAfter the guests depart, Macbeth contemplates the cycle of bloodshed and recalls superstitions about nature reacting to violence. He learns that Macduff did not attend the banquet and plans to send for him again. Macbeth decides to visit the witches the following day to seek further prophecies, indicating his growing dependence on supernatural guidance and his resolve to face whatever dangers lie ahead. The scene ends with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth preparing to retire for the night, with Macbeth acknowledging his descent into evil and the irreversible path he has chosen.\n\nThis scene vividly illustrates Macbeth's declining mental state and the increasing influence of guilt and paranoia. The appearance of Banquo's ghost symbolizes Macbeth's conscience haunting him, while Lady Macbeth struggles to preserve their public image. The banquet, intended as a celebration of their power, instead exposes the turmoil within Macbeth, foreshadowing the tragic consequences of his ambition and guilt."
