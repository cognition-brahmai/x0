        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression we have is (6 * 3^2 - 4) / 2. Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that. Let me recall: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Yep, that's the order I need to follow.\n\nSo, looking at the expression: (6 * 3^2 - 4) / 2.\n\nFirst, I see parentheses, so I need to handle what's inside the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, there's multiplication, an exponent, and subtraction. According to PEMDAS, exponents come before multiplication and subtraction.\n\nSo, let's deal with the exponent first: 3^2. That's 3 squared, which is 9. So, now the expression inside the parentheses becomes: 6 * 9 - 4.\n\nNext, multiplication comes before subtraction, so I'll do 6 * 9, which is 54. Now, the expression inside the parentheses is 54 - 4, which equals 50.\n\nSo, now the overall expression is 50 / 2.\n\nFinally, 50 divided by 2 is 25.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't miss anything. Let's go through it again.\n\nOriginal expression: (6 * 3^2 - 4) / 2.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the exponent: 3^2 = 9.\n\nSo, now it's (6 * 9 - 4) / 2.\n\nStep 2: Multiplication: 6 * 9 = 54.\n\nNow, it's (54 - 4) / 2.\n\nStep 3: Subtraction: 54 - 4 = 50.\n\nStep 4: Division: 50 / 2 = 25.\n\nSeems straightforward. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
