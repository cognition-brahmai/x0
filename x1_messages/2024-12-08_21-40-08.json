        "content": "Aha, this one's a music question! I'm a big fan of British singers, so this should be right up my alley. Let's see, \"19\" and \"21,\" both hit albums by the same British singer known for her distinctive voice and emotive songwriting. Hmm, I think I've heard of these albums before.\n\nLet me try to recall some details. The numbers in the album titles suggest that they might be related to the artist's age or maybe significant years in her life. I remember that a lot of British singers have gained international fame, especially in the pop and rock genres.\n\nWait a minute, Adele! She's a British singer with powerful vocals and very emotive songwriting. But I think her albums are titled \"19,\" \"21,\" and \"25.\" Yep, that sounds familiar. \"19\" was her debut album, released when she was 19 years old, and \"21\" was her second album, released when she was 21. Both albums were huge successes, producing hit songs like \"Chasing Pavements,\" \"Make You Feel My Love,\" and \"Someone Like You.\"\n\nI think that's the artist the user is referring to. Adele has a unique voice that's instantly recognizable, and her songwriting is deeply emotional, which matches the description provided.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another British singer with similar characteristics. Let's consider other options. There's Amy Winehouse, who was also a British singer with a distinctive voice and emotive songs, but her albums were titled \"Frank\" and \"Back to Black,\" not \"19\" and \"21.\"\n\nThen there's Ed Sheeran, who's also British and has albums like \"+\" and \"x,\" but those don't match the album titles mentioned. So, unlikely.\n\nAnother contender could be Jessie J, but her albums are titled \"Who You Are\" and \"Alive,\" so that doesn't fit either.\n\nSo, returning to Adele, I think she's the correct answer. To confirm, let's recall some more details about her career. Adele released \"19\" in 2008, which included hits like \"Chasing Pavements\" and \"Hometown Glory.\" Then, \"21\" was released in 2011 and featured songs like \"Rolling in the Deep,\" \"Someone Like You,\" and \"Set Fire to the Rain.\" These albums were immensely popular globally and earned Adele numerous awards.\n\nMoreover, her third album, \"25,\" continued the pattern, being released in 2015 when she was 25, and included hits like \"Hello\" and \"When We Were Young.\"\n\nGiven all this information, it seems clear that the British singer in question is Adele. She matches the description of having a distinctive voice, emotive songwriting, and has released hit albums titled \"19\" and \"21.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Adele}} \\]"
