        "content": "So the factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and each widget has three parts: A, B, and C. The defect rates are 2% for part A, 1% for part B, and 3% for part C. I need to find out how many defective widgets are produced daily.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a widget defective. If any of the parts are defective, does that make the whole widget defective? I think so, because if even one part is defective, the widget might not work properly. So, a widget is considered defective if at least one of its parts is defective.\n\nTo find the number of defective widgets, I could calculate the probability that a widget has at least one defective part and then multiply that by the total number of widgets produced daily.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the probability that a widget has no defective parts and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of having at least one defective part.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, find the probability that part A is not defective. Since the defect rate for part A is 2%, the non-defect rate is 100% - 2% = 98%, or 0.98.\n\nSimilarly, for part B, the defect rate is 1%, so the non-defect rate is 99%, or 0.99.\n\nFor part C, the defect rate is 3%, so the non-defect rate is 97%, or 0.97.\n\nAssuming that the defect rates for each part are independent, the probability that all three parts are not defective is the product of their individual non-defect probabilities.\n\nSo, probability that a widget is not defective = 0.98 * 0.99 * 0.97.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 0.98 * 0.99 = 0.9702.\n\nThen, 0.9702 * 0.97 = 0.940394.\n\nSo, the probability that a widget is not defective is approximately 0.9404.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a widget is defective is 1 - 0.9404 = 0.0596, or about 5.96%.\n\nNow, to find the number of defective widgets produced daily, I can multiply this probability by the total number of widgets produced per day.\n\nSo, defective widgets per day = 1000 * 0.0596 = 59.6.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a widget, I'll round it to the nearest whole number, which is 60.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces approximately 60 defective widgets daily.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the non-defect probabilities:\n\nPart A: 0.98\n\nPart B: 0.99\n\nPart C: 0.97\n\nProduct: 0.98 * 0.99 * 0.97 = 0.940394\n\nThen, defect probability: 1 - 0.940394 = 0.059606\n\nMultiply by 1000: 0.059606 * 1000 = 59.606\n\nRounding to nearest whole number: 60\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of defective parts for each type and see if that matches.\n\nFor part A: 2% of 1000 widgets have defective part A, so 0.02 * 1000 = 20 widgets have defective part A.\n\nFor part B: 1% of 1000 widgets have defective part B, so 0.01 * 1000 = 10 widgets have defective part B.\n\nFor part C: 3% of 1000 widgets have defective part C, so 0.03 * 1000 = 30 widgets have defective part C.\n\nBut if I just add these up, 20 + 10 + 30 = 60, which matches my previous result. Wait, is that coincidental?\n\nNo, because if defects in different parts are independent, the total number of defective widgets would be the sum minus the overlaps where widgets have multiple defective parts.\n\nBut in this case, since the probabilities are relatively small, the overlaps are small, and the approximation is close.\n\nAlternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the exact number would be:\n\nNumber of defective widgets = (A + B + C) - (A\u2229B + A\u2229C + B\u2229C) + (A\u2229B\u2229C)\n\nBut calculating all these intersections might be complicated, and given the small defect rates, the approximation is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces approximately 60 defective widgets daily.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
