        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The garden is 25 meters long and 15 meters wide. The gardener wants to plant flowers along the perimeter, putting one flower every meter. I need to figure out how many flowers they'll need.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is. I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, you can calculate it by adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula should be:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 25 meters + 2 \u00d7 15 meters\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n2 \u00d7 25 = 50 meters\n\n2 \u00d7 15 = 30 meters\n\nSo, the total perimeter is 50 + 30 = 80 meters.\n\nNow, the gardener wants to plant one flower every meter along this perimeter. That means, for every meter of the perimeter, there's one flower.\n\nTherefore, the number of flowers needed should be equal to the perimeter in meters.\n\nSo, 80 meters means 80 flowers.\n\nWait a minute, but I should think about whether there's any overlapping at the corners. Like, when you go from one side to another, does the flower at the corner get counted twice?\n\nLet me consider that. If I'm placing flowers at each meter, and the perimeter is 80 meters, then theoretically, there should be 80 distinct points, each a meter apart, around the rectangle.\n\nBut in practice, when you go around the rectangle, the starting point and the ending point would be the same, right? So, if I start at one corner and place flowers every meter, by the time I get back to the starting point, I would have covered the entire perimeter without double-counting the corners because each corner is part of both the length and the width, but in the perimeter calculation, it's already accounted for in the total distance.\n\nSo, in this case, 80 flowers should be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the number of intervals between flowers. If there's one flower every meter, then the number of flowers should equal the number of meters in the perimeter.\n\nSo, again, 80 flowers.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider a smaller example. Suppose I have a smaller rectangle that's 5 meters long and 3 meters wide.\n\nPerimeter would be 2\u00d75 + 2\u00d73 = 10 + 6 = 16 meters.\n\nIf I place one flower every meter, I should need 16 flowers.\n\nVisualizing that: starting at one corner, move 1 meter, plant a flower; repeat until I go all around the rectangle. When I get back to the start, I've planted 16 flowers, one at each meter.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nTherefore, for the original problem, the gardener will need 80 flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
