        "content": "So the original garden is a rectangle with a length of 15 meters and a width of 10 meters. The owner plans to increase the length by 5 meters and decrease the width by 2 meters. I need to find out what the new area of the garden will be after these changes.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for the original garden, the area would be 15 meters times 10 meters, which is 150 square meters. But since the dimensions are changing, I need to find the new length and new width first.\n\nThe new length will be the original length plus 5 meters. So, that's 15 meters + 5 meters = 20 meters.\n\nThe new width will be the original width minus 2 meters. So, that's 10 meters - 2 meters = 8 meters.\n\nNow, to find the new area, I multiply the new length by the new width: 20 meters times 8 meters.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 20 times 8 is 160.\n\nSo, the new area of the garden will be 160 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, original length is 15 meters, increase by 5 meters: 15 + 5 = 20 meters. That's correct.\n\nOriginal width is 10 meters, decrease by 2 meters: 10 - 2 = 8 meters. That's correct.\n\nArea is length times width: 20 meters * 8 meters = 160 square meters. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how the area changes. The original area is 150 square meters.\n\nIf I increase the length by 5 meters, that would add an extra strip of garden that is 5 meters by 10 meters, which is an additional 50 square meters, making the area 200 square meters.\n\nThen, decreasing the width by 2 meters would remove 2 meters from the width, but since the length is now 20 meters, that would remove 2 meters * 20 meters = 40 square meters.\n\nSo, starting from the original 150 square meters, adding 50 square meters for the increased length makes 200 square meters, then subtracting 40 square meters for the decreased width, that would be 160 square meters.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that the new area is indeed 160 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
