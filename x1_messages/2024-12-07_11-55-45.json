        "content": "So I've got this question here: If there are 7 billion people on Earth and the average person blinks about 15 times per minute, how many times do all humans blink collectively in one hour? Hmm, sounds interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 7 billion people, each blinking on average 15 times per minute, and I need to find out how many times all of them blink in one hour. Okay, so it's about multiplying rates and times across a large number of individuals.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many minutes there are in an hour. I know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, if a person blinks 15 times per minute, then in one hour, one person would blink 15 times/minute multiplied by 60 minutes/hour.\n\nSo, that's 15 * 60 = 900 times per hour per person.\n\nNow, since there are 7 billion people, I need to multiply the number of blinks per hour per person by the total number of people.\n\nSo, 900 blinks/hour/person * 7,000,000,000 people.\n\nWait a minute, 900 times 7 billion. That sounds like a lot. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the blinks per person per hour. 15 blinks/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 900 blinks/hour. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, 7 billion is 7,000,000,000. So, 900 * 7,000,000,000.\n\nI can simplify this multiplication. 900 times 7 is 6,300, and then I have to account for the 9 zeros in 7,000,000,000.\n\nWait, actually, 900 * 7 = 6,300, and then 6,300 * 1,000,000,000 = 6,300,000,000,000.\n\nBut that seems too large. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of powers of ten. 900 is 9 * 10^2, and 7 billion is 7 * 10^9. So, 9 * 10^2 * 7 * 10^9 = 63 * 10^(2+9) = 63 * 10^11.\n\nWait, but 9 * 7 is 63, and 10^2 * 10^9 is 10^11. So, 63 * 10^11 is 6.3 * 10^12.\n\nHold on, I'm getting confused with the exponents. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, 900 * 7,000,000,000.\n\nI can write 900 as 9 * 10^2 and 7,000,000,000 as 7 * 10^9.\n\nSo, (9 * 10^2) * (7 * 10^9) = 9*7 * 10^(2+9) = 63 * 10^11.\n\nBut 63 * 10^11 is the same as 6.3 * 10^12.\n\nWait, no. 63 * 10^11 is 6.3 * 10^12, because moving the decimal point one place to the left increases the exponent by one.\n\nSo, 63 * 10^11 = 6.3 * 10^12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of blinks per hour is 6.3 trillion.\n\nBut let me confirm if there's a simpler way to think about this.\n\nAnother approach: 15 blinks per minute per person, and 60 minutes in an hour, so 15*60=900 blinks per hour per person.\n\nThen, for 7 billion people, it's 900 * 7,000,000,000.\n\nAs before, that's 6,300,000,000,000.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation: 6.3 trillion blinks per hour.\n\nWait a second, is there any other factor I should consider? For example, are there times when people don't blink, like when they're sleeping?\n\nHmm, the question says \"on average,\" so presumably, this average already takes into account that people blink less when they're sleeping.\n\nBut just to be sure, I'll assume that the average of 15 blinks per minute is indeed the overall average for the entire day, including sleeping hours.\n\nSo, I don't need to adjust for sleeping times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of blinks per hour for all humans is 6.3 trillion.\n\nBut maybe I should express it in scientific notation to make it clearer.\n\n6.3 trillion can be written as 6.3 x 10^12.\n\nAlternatively, in standard numerical form, it's 6,300,000,000,000.\n\nWow, that's a huge number! It's mind-boggling to think about all those blinks happening every hour.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 15 blinks per minute per person.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 * 60 = 900 blinks per hour per person.\n\nThen, for 7,000,000,000 people, it's 900 * 7,000,000,000.\n\n900 times 7 is 6,300, and then adding the 9 zeros from 7,000,000,000 gives 6,300,000,000,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using exponents: 900 is 9 * 10^2, and 7,000,000,000 is 7 * 10^9.\n\nMultiplying them: 9*7 = 63, and 10^2 * 10^9 = 10^11, so 63 * 10^11 = 6.3 * 10^12.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.3 \\times 10^{12}} \\]"
