Let's create a simple Java application that calculates the factorial of a given integer using both recursion and iteration methods.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, we'll implement two methods to calculate the factorial:\n\n1. **Recursive method:** This method calls itself with a smaller value until it reaches the base case.\n\n2. **Iterative method:** This method uses a loop to calculate the factorial.\n\nAdditionally, we'll create a simple user interface to take input from the user and display the results.\n\n### Step 1: Create the Java Class\n\nLet's start by creating a new Java class named `FactorialCalculator`.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FactorialCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n        int number = scanner.nextInt();\n        scanner.close();\n\n        if (number < 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\");\n        } else {\n            long recursiveResult = factorialRecursive(number);\n            long iterativeResult = factorialIterative(number);\n            System.out.println(\"Factorial (Recursive): \" + recursiveResult);\n            System.out.println(\"Factorial (Iterative): \" + iterativeResult);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Recursive method to calculate factorial\n    public static long factorialRecursive(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorialRecursive(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Iterative method to calculate factorial\n    public static long factorialIterative(int n) {\n        long result = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            result *= i;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Explanation\n\n1. **Main Method:**\n   - We use `Scanner` to read input from the user.\n   - We check if the input is a non-negative integer.\n   - If the input is valid, we calculate the factorial using both recursive and iterative methods and display the results.\n\n2. **Recursive Method (`factorialRecursive`):**\n   - Base case: If `n` is 0, return 1.\n   - Recursive case: Return `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`.\n\n3. **Iterative Method (`factorialIterative`):**\n   - Initialize a result variable to 1.\n   - Use a for loop from 1 to n, multiplying the result by each number.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nTo run this application:\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `FactorialCalculator.java`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory containing the `FactorialCalculator.java` file.\n4. Compile the code using `javac FactorialCalculator.java`.\n5. Run the compiled program using `java FactorialCalculator`.\n6. Enter a non-negative integer when prompted.\n\nThe program will display the factorial calculated using both recursive and iterative methods.\n\n### Step 4: Testing\n\nLet's test the program with a few inputs:\n\n- **Input:** 5\n  - Expected Output:\n    - Factorial (Recursive): 120\n    - Factorial (Iterative): 120\n\n- **Input:** 0\n  - Expected Output:\n    - Factorial (Recursive): 1\n    - Factorial (Iterative): 1\n\n- **Input:** -1\n  - Expected Output:\n    - Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\nThis should cover the basic functionality of the program.\n\n### Step 5: Considerations\n\n- **Overflow:** Factorials can grow very large very quickly. In Java, `long` can handle factorials up to 20! (20 factorial). For larger numbers, consider using `BigInteger`.\n- **Performance:** For large values of `n`, the recursive method may cause a stack overflow. The iterative method is generally more efficient for larger values.\n\nThat's it! You now have a simple Java application that calculates factorials using both recursion and iteration.
