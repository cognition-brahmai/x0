        "content": "To design a SQL query that retrieves all employees who work in the IT department and have been employed for more than five years, we need to join the \"employee\" and \"department\" tables based on the employee ID and then apply the necessary filters.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Join the Tables:**\n   - We need to join the \"employee\" table with the \"department\" table using the employee_id in the \"department\" table, which corresponds to the id in the \"employee\" table.\n\n2. **Filter by Department:**\n   - We need to select only those records where the department_name is 'IT'.\n\n3. **Calculate Employment Duration:**\n   - We need to calculate the number of years an employee has been employed, which can be done by subtracting the hire_date from the current date.\n\n4. **Filter by Employment Duration:**\n   - We need to select only those employees who have been employed for more than five years.\n\nHere's the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.hire_date\nFROM employee e\nJOIN department d ON e.id = d.employee_id\nWHERE d.department_name = 'IT'\nAND DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), e.hire_date)/365 > 5;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **JOIN Clause:** We join the \"employee\" table (aliased as 'e') with the \"department\" table (aliased as 'd') on the condition that e.id = d.employee_id.\n\n- **WHERE Clause:**\n\n  - `d.department_name = 'IT'`: This ensures we only consider employees in the IT department.\n\n  - `DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), e.hire_date)/365 > 5`: This calculates the difference in days between the current date and the hire_date, then divides by 365 to get the approximate number of years, and checks if it's greater than 5.\n\nThis query will return the ID, first name, last name, and hire date of all employees who meet the specified criteria.\n"
