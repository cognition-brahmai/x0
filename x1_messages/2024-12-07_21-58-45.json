Prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, have a nucleus and other organelles. DNA, which contains the genetic information of an organism, is found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the nucleoid region of prokaryotic cells. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?\nA) All cells have a nucleus.\nB) DNA is not found in prokaryotic cells.\nC) Eukaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles.\nD) Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus.\nE) None of the above."

        "content": "Let's see. I have this question about cells in biology. It says that the cell is the basic unit of life, and all organisms are made up of cells. There are two main types: prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are like bacteria, and they don't have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells do have a nucleus and other organelles. DNA, which carries the genetic information, is in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the nucleoid region of prokaryotic cells.\n\nNow, I need to pick the correct statement from the options given:\n\nA) All cells have a nucleus.\n\nB) DNA is not found in prokaryotic cells.\n\nC) Eukaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles.\n\nD) Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus.\n\nE) None of the above.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"All cells have a nucleus.\" But I remember that prokaryotic cells don't have a nucleus. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B says, \"DNA is not found in prokaryotic cells.\" But the information says that DNA is found in the nucleoid region of prokaryotic cells. So, that's incorrect.\n\nOption C says, \"Eukaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles.\" But actually, eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles like the nucleus, mitochondria, and others. So, this is wrong.\n\nOption D says, \"Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus.\" That matches what I read. Prokaryotic cells don't have a nucleus.\n\nOption E is \"None of the above.\" But since option D seems correct, this wouldn't apply.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the correct statement is D) Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
