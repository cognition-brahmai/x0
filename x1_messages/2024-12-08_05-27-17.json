        "content": "Sure, here's a simple JavaScript function that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing only the elements that are common to both input arrays.\n\n```javascript\nfunction findCommonElements(arr1, arr2) {\n    // Use the filter method to create a new array that contains only elements present in both arrays\n    return arr1.filter(element => arr2.includes(element));\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst array2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8];\nconsole.log(findCommonElements(array1, array2)); // Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the first array (`arr1`) and checking if it exists in the second array (`arr2`) using the `includes` method. If the element is found in both arrays, it's included in the resulting array.\n\nNote that this approach is straightforward but may not be the most efficient for large arrays, as the `includes` method has a time complexity of O(n) for each check. For larger datasets, consider using a `Set` for faster lookups.\n\nHere's an optimized version using a `Set`:\n\n```javascript\nfunction findCommonElementsOptimized(arr1, arr2) {\n    const set2 = new Set(arr2);\n    return arr1.filter(element => set2.has(element));\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst array2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8];\nconsole.log(findCommonElementsOptimized(array1, array2)); // Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\nIn this optimized version, we first convert `arr2` into a `Set`, which allows for O(1) average-time complexity lookups. Then, we use the `filter` method on `arr1` to include only those elements that exist in the `Set` created from `arr2`. This approach is more efficient, especially for larger arrays."
