        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the company has an annual revenue of $1 million. First, we need to find out what its expenses are. The problem says that expenses are 60% of its revenue. So, expenses would be 60% of $1 million.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 1,000,000 by 0.60.\n\n1,000,000 * 0.60 = 600,000\n\nSo, expenses are $600,000.\n\nNext, we need to find out the profit before taxes. Profit before taxes would be revenue minus expenses.\n\nProfit before taxes = Revenue - Expenses\n\nProfit before taxes = 1,000,000 - 600,000 = 400,000\n\nSo, the profit before taxes is $400,000.\n\nNow, the company pays taxes at a rate of 30% on its profit. So, we need to calculate the tax amount.\n\nTax amount = Profit before taxes * Tax rate\n\nTax amount = 400,000 * 0.30 = 120,000\n\nSo, the tax amount is $120,000.\n\nFinally, to find out how much is left after paying all expenses and taxes, we need to subtract both the expenses and the taxes from the revenue.\n\nAmount left = Revenue - Expenses - Taxes\n\nAmount left = 1,000,000 - 600,000 - 120,000 = 280,000\n\nTherefore, the amount left after paying all expenses and taxes is $280,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{280000} \\]"
