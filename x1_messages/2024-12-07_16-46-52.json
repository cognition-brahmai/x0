Okay, so I'll start by writing down the rule and the first term.\n\nFirst term: a\u2081 = 4\n\nRule: a\u2099 = 3 * a\u2099\u208b\u2081 - 2\n\nSo, to find the second term, I'll plug in a\u2081 into the rule.\n\na\u2082 = 3 * a\u2081 - 2 = 3 * 4 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\n\nNow, for the third term, I'll use a\u2082.\n\na\u2083 = 3 * a\u2082 - 2 = 3 * 10 - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28\n\nNext, the fourth term using a\u2083.\n\na\u2084 = 3 * a\u2083 - 2 = 3 * 28 - 2 = 84 - 2 = 82\n\nFinally, the fifth term using a\u2084.\n\na\u2085 = 3 * a\u2084 - 2 = 3 * 82 - 2 = 246 - 2 = 244\n\nSo, the fifth term in the sequence is 244.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with a\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 3 * 4 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2083 = 3 * 10 - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2084 = 3 * 28 - 2 = 84 - 2 = 82 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2085 = 3 * 82 - 2 = 246 - 2 = 244 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems correct. So, the fifth term is indeed 244.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{244} \\]"
