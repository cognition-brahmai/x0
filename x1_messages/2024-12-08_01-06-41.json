NaCl stands for sodium chloride, which is the scientific name for salt. It is a crystalline solid that is widely used as a seasoning and food preservative. Salt is essential for human health, as it plays a crucial role in maintaining proper fluid balance, transmitting nerve impulses, and supporting muscle function. However, excessive consumption of salt can lead to health problems such as high blood pressure and increased risk of heart disease."
