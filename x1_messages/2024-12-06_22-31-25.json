        "content": "I'd be happy to help you calculate the integral of the function h(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2 from x = 0 to x = 4. I'll walk you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what an integral is. In calculus, an integral is used to find areas, volumes, central points, and other useful information. The integral of a function can be thought of as the area under the curve of that function within a certain range.\n\nIn this case, we're dealing with a definite integral, which means we're integrating the function h(x) from a lower limit (x = 0) to an upper limit (x = 4). The notation for this is:\n\n\u222b from 0 to 4 of (3x^2 - 6x + 2) dx\n\nTo solve this, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the antiderivative of h(x):** The antiderivative is the reverse process of differentiation. For each term in the function, we'll increase the exponent by one and then divide by that new exponent.\n\n2. **Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (x = 4):** Plug x = 4 into the antiderivative.\n\n3. **Evaluate the antiderivative at the lower limit (x = 0):** Plug x = 0 into the antiderivative.\n\n4. **Subtract the value obtained at the lower limit from the value obtained at the upper limit:** This will give us the definite integral from 0 to 4.\n\nLet's start with step 1: finding the antiderivative of h(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2.\n\nFor the term 3x^2:\n\n- Increase the exponent from 2 to 3: 3x^3\n\n- Divide by the new exponent: (3/3)x^3 = x^3\n\nFor the term -6x:\n\n- Increase the exponent from 1 to 2: -6x^2\n\n- Divide by the new exponent: (-6/2)x^2 = -3x^2\n\nFor the constant term 2:\n\n- Increase the exponent from 0 to 1: 2x^1 = 2x\n\n- Divide by the new exponent: (2/1)x = 2x\n\nSo, the antiderivative H(x) of h(x) is:\n\nH(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration. However, since we're dealing with a definite integral, the constant will cancel out when we subtract the values at the limits, so we can ignore it for now.\n\nNow, onto step 2: evaluate H(x) at x = 4.\n\nH(4) = (4)^3 - 3*(4)^2 + 2*(4)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(4)^3 = 64\n\n-3*(4)^2 = -3*16 = -48\n\n2*(4) = 8\n\nSo, H(4) = 64 - 48 + 8 = 24\n\nNext, step 3: evaluate H(x) at x = 0.\n\nH(0) = (0)^3 - 3*(0)^2 + 2*(0) = 0 - 0 + 0 = 0\n\nFinally, step 4: subtract H(0) from H(4).\n\n\u222b from 0 to 4 of (3x^2 - 6x + 2) dx = H(4) - H(0) = 24 - 0 = 24\n\nTherefore, the integral of h(x) from x = 0 to x = 4 is 24.\n\nTo double-check our work, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. One alternative method is to factor the polynomial or look for symmetry, but in this case, the straightforward method of finding the antiderivative and evaluating it at the limits is the most efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that the definite integral of a function from a to b is equal to the antiderivative evaluated at b minus the antiderivative evaluated at a. We've already done that, so our answer should be correct.\n\nAnother way to verify is to think about the graph of h(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2 from x = 0 to x = 4. This is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola opening upwards because the coefficient of x^2 is positive. The function has roots at x = 1 and x = 2/3, but within the interval [0, 4], it changes from negative to positive.\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with the area under the curve, and the integral gives us a positive value of 24, it means that the area above the x-axis outweighs the area below the x-axis within this interval.\n\nTo get a better understanding, let's find where h(x) crosses the x-axis in the interval [0, 4].\n\nSet h(x) = 0:\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(36 - 24)] / 6 = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(12)] / 6 = [6 \u00b1 2*sqrt(3)] / 6 = 1 \u00b1 sqrt(3)/3\n\nSo, the roots are at x = 1 - sqrt(3)/3 and x = 1 + sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThese are approximately x \u2248 0.423 and x \u2248 1.577.\n\nThis means that h(x) is negative between these two roots and positive elsewhere in the interval [0, 4].\n\nTherefore, the integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of the areas where the function is above the x-axis minus the areas where it's below, but since the function is mostly positive in this interval, the total integral is positive.\n\nGiven that, our calculation of 24 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, we could split the integral into parts where the function is positive and where it's negative, but that's more complicated and not necessary here since the antiderivative method works fine.\n\nIn conclusion, the integral of h(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
