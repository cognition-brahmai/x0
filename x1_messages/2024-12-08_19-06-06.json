Each step of your plan should have an associated evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nSearchEngine[input]: This tool allows the user to search for information on the internet. The function doesn't directly answer the question; it finds a list of sites that may contain the answer.\nTextScraper[input]: This tool loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: This tool extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAIAnswerer[input]: This is a question answering AI model, useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the history behind the creation of Bitcoin and who was involved?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out about the history of Bitcoin and who was involved in its creation. I think the best way to start is by searching for some information online. So, I'll use the SearchEngine tool to look up \"history of Bitcoin creation.\"\n\nPlan: Use SearchEngine to find sources about the history of Bitcoin creation.\n\n:evidence0: = SearchEngine[\"history of Bitcoin creation\"]\n\nOnce I have those search results, I'll need to look through them to find relevant information. Maybe some of the top results will have detailed articles or reports about how Bitcoin came to be. I should probably pick a few of those links and see what they say.\n\nPlan: Extract links from the search results to find specific sources to read.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\nNow, with these links, I need to actually read through them to find the information I'm looking for. That sounds like a job for the TextScraper tool. I'll input those links into TextScraper to get the text content of those pages.\n\nPlan: Use TextScraper to extract text from the selected links.\n\n:evidence2: = TextScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nWith all this text, it's probably a lot to go through. I need to find the parts that talk about the history and the people involved in creating Bitcoin. Maybe I can look for keywords like \"creation,\" \"history,\" \"founders,\" \"Satoshi Nakamoto,\" etc.\n\nPlan: Look through the scraped text for information about Bitcoin's creation and key figures.\n\nThis seems a bit time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way. Wait, there's an AIAnswerer tool that can answer questions based on a passage of text. If I feed it the scraped text and ask about Bitcoin's history and who was involved, it might be able to summarize it for me.\n\nPlan: Use AIAnswerer to answer the question based on the scraped text.\n\n:evidence3: = AIAnswerer[\"What is the history behind the creation of Bitcoin and who was involved? Given evidence: \" + :evidence2:]\n\nBut I should probably make sure that the information is accurate. Maybe I should cross-verify it with another source. I can use the SearchEngine again to look for more information or to find out if there are any updates or different perspectives on the creation of Bitcoin.\n\nPlan: Perform another search to cross-verify the information.\n\n:evidence4: = SearchEngine[\"Bitcoin creation history verification\"]\n\nThen, extract links from these new search results to find additional sources.\n\nPlan: Extract links from the new search results.\n\n:evidence5: = LinkExtractor[:evidence4:]\n\nScrape the text from these new links.\n\nPlan: Use TextScraper to get text from the additional links.\n\n:evidence6: = TextScraper[:evidence5:]\n\nNow, compare this new information with what I got earlier. If it matches, that increases the confidence in the accuracy. If there are discrepancies, I need to look into that further.\n\nPlan: Use AIAnswerer to compare the new information with the previous evidence.\n\n:evidence7: = AIAnswerer[\"Does the information in evidence6 confirm the history and involved parties in Bitcoin's creation as described in evidence3?\"]\n\nIf there are any inconsistencies, I might need to dig deeper or look for more sources to resolve them.\n\nPlan: If discrepancies are found, perform additional searches to resolve them.\n\nBut for now, assuming the information matches, I can proceed to summarize the history of Bitcoin's creation and the key figures involved based on :evidence3: and :evidence7:.\n\nFinal Answer: :evidence3:"
