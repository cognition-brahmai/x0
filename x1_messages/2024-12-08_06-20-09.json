        "content": "So I've got this hypothesis testing problem here. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. We have a sample of 30 observations, with a mean of 65 and a standard deviation of 8. We need to test if the population mean is actually 60, and we're using a 5% level of significance. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what hypothesis testing is all about. It's a way to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. We have two hypotheses: the null hypothesis, which is what we assume is true unless evidence suggests otherwise, and the alternative hypothesis, which is what we consider if the null is not true.\n\nIn this case, the null hypothesis (H0) is that the population mean is 60. So, H0: \u03bc = 60. The alternative hypothesis (H1) would be that the population mean is not 60. So, H1: \u03bc \u2260 60. This is a two-tailed test because we're interested in deviations in both directions from 60.\n\nNext, we need to decide on a level of significance, which is given as 5%, or 0.05. This is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true, also known as a Type I error.\n\nSince we have the sample mean (x\u0304 = 65), the sample standard deviation (s = 8), and the sample size (n = 30), we can use a t-test because the population standard deviation is unknown. If the population standard deviation was known, we might use a z-test, but in this case, s is provided, so t-test is appropriate.\n\nLet me check the conditions for the t-test. The sample should be random, and the data should be approximately normally distributed, especially since the sample size is small (n < 30). But with n = 30, which is often considered the threshold for using the central limit theorem, the sampling distribution of the mean should be approximately normal even if the population distribution isn't perfectly normal.\n\nAlright, so I'll proceed with the t-test.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x\u0304 - \u03bc) / (s / \u221an)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt = (65 - 60) / (8 / \u221a30)\n\nLet me calculate the denominator:\n\ns / \u221an = 8 / \u221a30 \u2248 8 / 5.477 \u2248 1.461\n\nSo, t \u2248 5 / 1.461 \u2248 3.42\n\nOkay, t \u2248 3.42\n\nNow, I need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a 5% level of significance and n - 1 degrees of freedom. Since n = 30, degrees of freedom (df) = 29.\n\nLooking up the t-distribution table for df = 29 and \u03b1/2 = 0.025 (since it's two-tailed), the critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.045.\n\nSo, if our calculated t-score is greater than 2.045 or less than -2.045, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nIn this case, t \u2248 3.42, which is greater than 2.045. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the p-value associated with t = 3.42 and df = 29, and compare it to the significance level of 0.05. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject H0.\n\nUsing a t-distribution calculator, the p-value for t = 3.42 and df = 29 is approximately 0.002, which is much less than 0.05. So, again, we would reject H0.\n\nTherefore, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that the population mean is not 60 at the 5% significance level.\n\nBut let's double-check our calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, sample mean x\u0304 = 65\n\nPopulation mean \u03bc = 60\n\nSample standard deviation s = 8\n\nSample size n = 30\n\nt = (65 - 60) / (8 / \u221a30) = 5 / (8 / 5.477) = 5 / 1.461 \u2248 3.42\n\nDegrees of freedom df = 30 - 1 = 29\n\nCritical t-value for two-tailed test at 5% significance level: \u00b12.045\n\nSince 3.42 > 2.045, reject H0.\n\nAlternatively, p-value \u2248 0.002 < 0.05, so reject H0.\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, we conclude that the population mean is significantly different from 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Reject } H_0 \\text{ at the 5% significance level.}} \\]"
