        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units every day, and each unit sells for $25. It operates 6 days a week. I need to find out how much revenue the factory generates in one week.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of units produced in one week. Since it produces 500 units per day and operates 6 days a week, I can multiply 500 by 6.\n\n500 units/day * 6 days/week = 3000 units/week\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 3000 units in one week.\n\nNext, each unit sells for $25, so to find the total revenue, I need to multiply the number of units by the price per unit.\n\n3000 units * $25/unit = $75,000\n\nTherefore, the factory generates $75,000 in revenue each week.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Are there any other costs or factors that might affect the revenue? The question asks for revenue, which is the total income from sales, so I think just multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit is sufficient.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check. Revenue is indeed the total income from sales before any costs are subtracted. So, $75,000 should be the correct weekly revenue.\n\nI think that's it. The factory generates $75,000 in revenue per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
