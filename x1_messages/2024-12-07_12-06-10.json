        "content": "So I have this problem here. There's a rectangular garden that measures 30 feet by 40 feet, and the owner wants to build a walkway around it with a uniform width of 2 feet. I need to find out what the area of this walkway will be.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize what's going on. There's a rectangular garden, 30 ft by 40 ft, and around it, there's going to be a walkway that's 2 ft wide all the way around. So, the walkway surrounds the garden on all four sides.\n\nTo find the area of the walkway, I think one way to approach this is to find the total area including both the garden and the walkway, and then subtract the area of the garden itself. That should give me the area of just the walkway.\n\nSo, let's start by finding the total area including the garden and the walkway.\n\nThe garden is 30 ft by 40 ft. The walkway is 2 ft wide around all sides. So, the walkway adds 2 ft to each side of the garden.\n\nWait a minute, actually, since the walkway surrounds the garden on all sides, the total width added to the garden would be 2 ft on each side, so that's 4 ft in total width added (2 ft on one side and 2 ft on the other side).\n\nSimilarly, the length would have 2 ft added to both ends, so again, 4 ft in total length added.\n\nTherefore, the total dimensions including the walkway would be:\n\nLength: 40 ft + 4 ft = 44 ft\n\nWidth: 30 ft + 4 ft = 34 ft\n\nSo, the total area including the garden and the walkway is 44 ft * 34 ft.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n44 * 34.\n\nWell, 40 * 30 = 1200\n\n40 * 4 = 160\n\n4 * 30 = 120\n\n4 * 4 = 16\n\nSo, 1200 + 160 = 1360\n\n1360 + 120 = 1480\n\n1480 + 16 = 1496 sq ft.\n\nNow, the area of the garden itself is 30 ft * 40 ft = 1200 sq ft.\n\nSo, to find the area of the walkway, I subtract the garden area from the total area:\n\n1496 sq ft - 1200 sq ft = 296 sq ft.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to approach this to verify?\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the area of the walkway directly. Since the walkway is uniform around the garden, it forms a frame around the garden.\n\nSo, the walkway consists of two parts: the parts along the length and the parts along the width.\n\nSpecifically, there are two strips along the length (top and bottom) and two strips along the width (sides).\n\nBut wait, actually, since it's a uniform width, it's more like a rectangular frame.\n\nSo, the area of the walkway would be the perimeter of the garden multiplied by the width of the walkway, minus the corners where the strips overlap.\n\nHmm, but that might get complicated. Maybe sticking with the first method is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire area including the walkway and subtract the garden area, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since the walkway is 2 ft wide around all sides, I can calculate the area of the walkway by considering it as four rectangles: two rectangles that are 40 ft long and 2 ft wide (for the top and bottom), and two rectangles that are 30 ft long and 2 ft wide (for the sides).\n\nWait, but that would double-count the corners where the sides meet the top and bottom.\n\nSo, if I calculate two rectangles of 40 ft by 2 ft and two rectangles of 30 ft by 2 ft, that would give me:\n\n2*(40*2) + 2*(30*2) = 2*(80) + 2*(60) = 160 + 120 = 280 sq ft.\n\nBut earlier, I got 296 sq ft using the first method. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method.\n\nLet me double-check the first method.\n\nIn the first method, I added 2 ft to each side of the garden for the walkway.\n\nSo, for the length: 40 ft + 2 ft (one side) + 2 ft (other side) = 44 ft.\n\nSimilarly, for the width: 30 ft + 2 ft + 2 ft = 34 ft.\n\nThen, total area is 44 ft * 34 ft = 1496 sq ft.\n\nGarden area is 30 ft * 40 ft = 1200 sq ft.\n\nWalkway area: 1496 - 1200 = 296 sq ft.\n\nIn the second method, I calculated the area of the walkway as two rectangles of 40 ft by 2 ft and two rectangles of 30 ft by 2 ft, which totals 2*(40*2) + 2*(30*2) = 160 + 120 = 280 sq ft.\n\nBut these two methods give different results. There must be a mistake somewhere.\n\nAh, I see the issue. In the second method, when I calculate the area of the walkway as two rectangles of 40 ft by 2 ft and two rectangles of 30 ft by 2 ft, I'm double-counting the corners where the rectangles overlap.\n\nEach corner is a square of 2 ft by 2 ft, and there are four corners.\n\nSo, in the second method, I've added the area of the corners twice, once in the length strips and once in the width strips.\n\nTherefore, I need to subtract the area of the four corners to get the correct walkway area.\n\nSo, the correction would be:\n\nTotal walkway area = 2*(40*2) + 2*(30*2) - 4*(2*2) = 160 + 120 - 16 = 280 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nBut wait, now I have three different results: 296 sq ft, 280 sq ft, and 264 sq ft.\n\nThis is confusing. There must be a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI can think of the entire area including the walkway as a larger rectangle, and the garden as a smaller rectangle inside it.\n\nThe walkway is the area between these two rectangles.\n\nSo, the area of the walkway is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the smaller rectangle.\n\nEarlier, I calculated the larger rectangle as 44 ft by 34 ft, which is correct, and the garden as 40 ft by 30 ft.\n\nWait, no, the garden is 30 ft by 40 ft, but that's the same as 40 ft by 30 ft.\n\nSo, area of larger rectangle: 44 ft * 34 ft = 1496 sq ft.\n\nArea of garden: 30 ft * 40 ft = 1200 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, walkway area: 1496 - 1200 = 296 sq ft.\n\nThis matches the first method.\n\nIn the second method, when I considered the walkway as four rectangles, I had to account for the overlapping corners.\n\nEach corner is 2 ft by 2 ft, and since I'm adding the side rectangles and the end rectangles, each corner is counted twice.\n\nTherefore, to correct for that, I need to subtract the area of the four corners.\n\nSo, total walkway area = 2*(40*2) + 2*(30*2) - 4*(2*2) = 160 + 120 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nBut this doesn't match the first method's result of 296 sq ft.\n\nThere's still a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the second method.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nThe walkway consists of two strips along the length (top and bottom) and two strips along the width (sides).\n\nEach strip along the length is 40 ft long and 2 ft wide, but actually, since the walkway surrounds the garden, the top and bottom strips would each be 40 ft long, but they overlap with the side strips at the corners.\n\nSimilarly, the side strips are 30 ft long and 2 ft wide, but they also overlap at the corners with the top and bottom strips.\n\nSo, when I add the areas of the top and bottom strips (2*(40*2) = 160 sq ft) and the side strips (2*(30*2) = 120 sq ft), I'm double-counting the area of the four corners.\n\nEach corner is a square of 2 ft by 2 ft, so each corner has an area of 4 sq ft.\n\nSince there are four corners, the total overlapping area is 4*4 = 16 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, to get the correct walkway area, I need to subtract this overlapping area from the total of the strips.\n\nSo, walkway area = 160 + 120 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nBut this differs from the first method's result of 296 sq ft.\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the side strips are not 30 ft long but slightly longer because the walkway extends around the corners.\n\nWait, no, the side strips are indeed 30 ft long because that's the width of the garden, and the walkway is uniform 2 ft wide.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the side strips should be 30 ft plus the walkway width, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently.\n\nI can think of the walkway as consisting of two parts: the perimeter strips minus the overlapping corners.\n\nBut this seems to be leading to confusion.\n\nMaybe I should consider the area difference method again, which gave me 296 sq ft, and accept that as correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of the larger rectangle's area.\n\nLet me recalculate the area of the larger rectangle.\n\nThe garden is 30 ft by 40 ft.\n\nThe walkway is 2 ft wide around all sides.\n\nSo, the larger rectangle's length is 40 ft + 2*(2 ft) = 44 ft.\n\nWidth is 30 ft + 2*(2 ft) = 34 ft.\n\nArea: 44 ft * 34 ft.\n\nLet me confirm this multiplication:\n\n44 * 34.\n\n40*30 = 1200\n\n40*4 = 160\n\n4*30 = 120\n\n4*4 = 16\n\nTotal: 1200 + 160 = 1360\n\n1360 + 120 = 1480\n\n1480 + 16 = 1496 sq ft.\n\nGarden area: 30*40 = 1200 sq ft.\n\nWalkway area: 1496 - 1200 = 296 sq ft.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nNow, in the second method, considering the walkway as four rectangles:\n\nTwo rectangles along the length: 40 ft * 2 ft each, so 2*(40*2) = 160 sq ft.\n\nTwo rectangles along the width: 30 ft * 2 ft each, so 2*(30*2) = 120 sq ft.\n\nTotal: 160 + 120 = 280 sq ft.\n\nBut as previously noted, this double-counts the corners.\n\nEach corner is 2 ft * 2 ft = 4 sq ft, and there are four corners, so total overlapping area is 16 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, walkway area should be 280 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nBut this doesn't match the first method's result of 296 sq ft.\n\nThere's clearly a mistake here somewhere.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the side strips aren't just 30 ft long; perhaps they are 30 ft plus the walkway width.\n\nWait, no, the side strips are alongside the garden's width, which is 30 ft, plus the walkway on both sides.\n\nWait, no, the walkway is uniform 2 ft wide around the garden, so the side strips are indeed 30 ft long and 2 ft wide.\n\nSimilarly, the top and bottom strips are 40 ft long and 2 ft wide.\n\nSo, total area of strips: 2*(40*2) + 2*(30*2) = 160 + 120 = 280 sq ft.\n\nBut this doesn't account for the fact that at the corners, the strips overlap.\n\nEach corner is counted in both the length and width strips, so I need to subtract the area of the four corners to avoid double-counting.\n\nEach corner is 2 ft by 2 ft, so 4 sq ft each, total 16 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, walkway area = 280 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nBut this doesn't match the first method's result of 296 sq ft.\n\nWhat's going on here? I must have miscounted something.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the walkway forms a border around the garden, and its area can be calculated as the area of a rectangle with dimensions (length + 2*width of walkway) and (width + 2*width of walkway), minus the area of the garden.\n\nSo, area of walkway = (30 + 2*2) * (40 + 2*2) - 30*40 = 34*44 - 1200 = 1496 - 1200 = 296 sq ft.\n\nThis matches the first method.\n\nBut why does the second method give 264 sq ft?\n\nWait, perhaps in the second method, I'm not accounting for the fact that the walkway extends beyond the garden on all sides, including the corners.\n\nWait, no, the walkway is uniformly 2 ft wide around the garden, so the corners are included in the strips.\n\nI think the confusion arises from how I'm calculating the area of the strips.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the side strips are not just 30 ft long but 30 ft plus the width of the walkway.\n\nWait, no, the side strips are alongside the garden's width, which is 30 ft, and the walkway is 2 ft wide on each side.\n\nSo, the side strips are 30 ft long and 2 ft wide.\n\nSimilarly, the top and bottom strips are 40 ft long and 2 ft wide.\n\nBut when I add these areas, I get 2*(40*2) + 2*(30*2) = 160 + 120 = 280 sq ft.\n\nThen, subtracting the overlapping corners: 280 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nBut this still doesn't match the first method's result of 296 sq ft.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overlapping corners shouldn't be subtracted in this way.\n\nLet me try to calculate the area of the walkway by dividing it into parts without double-counting the corners.\n\nSo, the walkway consists of two rectangular strips along the length (top and bottom) and two rectangular strips along the width (sides), but the corners are where these strips meet.\n\nSo, to avoid double-counting, I can calculate the area of the top strip as 40 ft * 2 ft = 80 sq ft, the bottom strip as 40 ft * 2 ft = 80 sq ft, the left side strip as 30 ft * 2 ft = 60 sq ft, and the right side strip as 30 ft * 2 ft = 60 sq ft.\n\nTotal area: 80 + 80 + 60 + 60 = 280 sq ft.\n\nBut again, this double-counts the corners.\n\nEach corner is 2 ft by 2 ft, so 4 sq ft, and there are four corners, so total overlapping area is 16 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, to get the correct walkway area, I need to subtract this overlapping area: 280 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nBut this doesn't match the first method's result of 296 sq ft.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side strips should be adjusted for the width of the walkway.\n\nWait, perhaps the side strips should be 30 ft + 4 ft (2 ft on each end due to the walkway), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, the side strips run alongside the garden's width, which is 30 ft, and the walkway is 2 ft wide on each side.\n\nSo, the side strips are indeed 30 ft long and 2 ft wide.\n\nSimilarly, the top and bottom strips are 40 ft long and 2 ft wide.\n\nSo, total area of strips: 2*(40*2) + 2*(30*2) = 160 + 120 = 280 sq ft.\n\nSubtracting the overlapping corners: 280 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nBut this still doesn't match the first method's result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overlapping corners shouldn't be subtracted in this way.\n\nLet me try to think of the walkway as the perimeter of the garden plus the walkway width.\n\nWait, no, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the area of the walkway by considering it as a larger rectangle minus the garden, which is what I did in the first method.\n\nThat gave me 1496 - 1200 = 296 sq ft.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it doesn't match the second method's adjusted result of 264 sq ft.\n\nI think the first method is correct, and there's a flaw in the second method.\n\nPerhaps the second method isn't accounting for the fact that the walkway extends beyond the garden on all sides, including the corners.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the walkway forms a frame around the garden, and its area is the perimeter of the garden multiplied by the walkway width minus the overlapping corners.\n\nWait, the perimeter of the garden is 2*(30 + 40) = 140 ft.\n\nMultiplying by the walkway width: 140 ft * 2 ft = 280 sq ft.\n\nThen, subtracting the overlapping corners: 280 - 16 = 264 sq ft.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match the first method's result.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter method isn't directly applicable here because the walkway has a uniform width around the garden, forming a larger rectangle.\n\nIn that case, the area of the walkway is indeed the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the garden.\n\nSo, 1496 - 1200 = 296 sq ft.\n\nI think this is the correct approach and the correct answer is 296 sq ft.\n\nThe second method is flawed in how I'm accounting for the overlapping corners.\n\nTherefore, the area of the walkway is 296 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{296} \\]"
