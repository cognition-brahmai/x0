It involves file handling and string operations in Python. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, you need to understand how file handling works in Python. Python provides built-in functions for working with files. To read a file, you can use the `open()` function, which returns a file object. You can then iterate over this file object to read each line one by one.\n\nHere\u2019s a basic structure of how you can approach this:\n\n1. **Open the file**: Use the `open()` function with the file name and mode ('r' for reading).\n2. **Read the file line by line**: Use a loop to iterate through each line in the file.\n3. **Check for the keyword**: For each line, check if the keyword is present.\n4. **Print the line**: If the keyword is found in the line, print that line.\n5. **Close the file**: Make sure to close the file after you're done reading from it.\n\nLet's consider an example to make this clearer. Suppose you have a text file named \"example.txt\" with the following content:\n\n```\nPython is a great language.\nIt is widely used in data science.\nMachine learning is also popular with Python.\n```\n\nAnd you want to find all lines containing the keyword \"Python\".\n\nHere\u2019s how you can write the script:\n\n```python\ndef find_lines_with_keyword(file_name, keyword):\n    # Open the file in read mode\n    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:\n        # Iterate over each line in the file\n        for line in file:\n            # Check if the keyword is in the line\n            if keyword in line:\n                # Print the line\n                print(line.strip())  # strip() removes the trailing newline character\n\n# Example usage\nfile_name = \"example.txt\"\nkeyword = \"Python\"\nfind_lines_with_keyword(file_name, keyword)\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- The `with` statement is used to handle the file. It ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way. This is a recommended way to handle files in Python.\n\n- The `for` loop reads the file line by line, which is memory efficient, especially for large files.\n\n- The `if keyword in line` checks if the keyword is present in the line. If it is, the line is printed after stripping the trailing newline character using `strip()` to make the output cleaner.\n\nYou can modify this script according to your needs. For example, you might want to make the search case-insensitive. To do that, you can convert both the line and the keyword to lowercase before comparing:\n\n```python\nif keyword.lower() in line.lower():\n    print(line.strip())\n```\n\nThis way, the search is not affected by the case of the letters in the file or the keyword.\n\nAlso, if you want to take the file name and keyword as inputs from the user, you can use the `input()` function:\n\n```python\nfile_name = input(\"Enter the file name: \")\nkeyword = input(\"Enter the keyword: \")\nfind_lines_with_keyword(file_name, keyword)\n```\n\nThis makes your script more interactive.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with your script!
