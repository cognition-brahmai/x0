        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with marbles: 5 red, 3 blue, and 7 green. So, total marbles in the bag are 5 + 3 + 7, which is 15 marbles.\n\nThe question is, if you pick two marbles without replacement, what's the probability that both are green. Okay, so without replacement means once you pick the first marble, it stays out, and you pick the second one from the remaining marbles.\n\nProbability of both events happening is the probability of the first event multiplied by the probability of the second event given that the first one has already happened.\n\nSo, first, the probability of picking a green marble on the first draw. There are 7 green marbles out of 15 total, so that's 7/15.\n\nNow, since we're not replacing it, there are now 14 marbles left in the bag, and 6 of them are green. So, the probability of picking another green marble is 6/14.\n\nSo, the overall probability should be (7/15) multiplied by (6/14).\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 7/15 * 6/14.\n\nI can simplify this before multiplying. Notice that 7 and 14 both divisible by 7, so 7/14 is 1/2. And 6 and 15, both divisible by 3, so 6/15 is 2/5.\n\nSo, it becomes (1/15/7) * (2/5) = (1/ ) wait, maybe I should do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, 7/15 * 6/14 = (7*6)/(15*14) = 42 / 210.\n\nNow, 42 divided by 210 is 0.2, or in fraction terms, that's 1/5.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check.\n\n42 divided by 210 is indeed 0.2, and 0.2 is 1/5.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/5.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 marbles out of 15 is C(15,2), which is (15*14)/2 = 105.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 green marbles out of 7 is C(7,2), which is (7*6)/2 = 21.\n\nSo, the probability is 21 / 105 = 1/5.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the probability that both marbles are green is 1/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}} \\]"
