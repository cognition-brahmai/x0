        "content": "So the factory currently produces 1500 units per day, and they want to increase that by 25%. I need to find out how many additional units that would be.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate what 25% of 1500 is, because that's the increase they're planning. To find 25% of a number, I can multiply the number by 0.25. So, 1500 times 0.25 should give me the additional units.\n\nLet me do that: 1500 \u00d7 0.25. That's 375. So, they're planning to add 375 units to their daily production.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can check this another way. If I increase 1500 by 25%, the new production amount should be 1500 plus 25% of 1500. Or, another way to look at it is, 1500 times 1.25, because increasing by 25% is the same as multiplying by 1.25.\n\nSo, 1500 \u00d7 1.25 equals 1875. That means the new production amount is 1875 units per day.\n\nTo find the additional units, I can subtract the original production from the new production: 1875 - 1500 equals 375.\n\nSo, both ways, I get 375 additional units.\n\nWait a minute, but the question asks for the additional units produced each day after the increase, which according to my calculations is 375.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps considering that the increase is 25% of the original production, which is 1500, so again, 25% of 1500 is 375.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in fractions. 25% is the same as 1/4, so one-fourth of 1500 is 375.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's verify this with fraction multiplication: 1500 \u00d7 (25/100) = 1500 \u00d7 (1/4) = 375.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think it's clear that the additional units produced each day after the increase will be 375.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
