Let me see what you've got there.\n\nSo, you mentioned that Abraham Lincoln was the 18th President of the United States, born on December 2, 1810, in a large plantation house in Virginia. He's known for ending the Spanish-American War and signing the Declaration of Independence, and he was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr on July 11, 1804.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit off. Let me check the reference you provided: https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/abraham-lincoln.\n\nOkay, visiting this link, it seems there might be some confusion here. Let's clarify a few things based on historical facts.\n\nFirstly, Abraham Lincoln was actually the 16th President of the United States, not the 18th. He served from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865.\n\nSecondly, Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hodgenville, Kentucky, not December 2, 1810, in Virginia. His family lived in a simple log cabin, not a large plantation house.\n\nRegarding his accomplishments, Lincoln is most famously known for leading the country through the American Civil War, preserving the Union and ending slavery. He is the one who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which declared slaves in Confederate-held areas to be free.\n\nThe Spanish-American War occurred in 1898, long after Lincoln's presidency and death, so he couldn't have ended that war. The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, and was primarily drafted by Thomas Jefferson, not Abraham Lincoln.\n\nLastly, the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton happened on July 11, 1804, resulting in Hamilton's death. Abraham Lincoln was not involved in this duel; he was only five years old at that time.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hodgenville, Kentucky.\n\nReference: https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/abraham-lincoln\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion! Let me know if you have more questions."
