        "content": "So, the farmer has a rectangular field that's 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to plant trees along the perimeter of the field, with equal spacing between each tree. The minimum distance between two adjacent trees should be at least 10 meters. We need to find out the maximum number of trees he can plant under these conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the perimeter of the rectangular field. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:\n\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2 * (120 + 80) = 2 * 200 = 400 meters\n\nThat means the total perimeter is 400 meters where trees will be planted.\n\nNow, the trees are to be planted with equal spacing, and the minimum distance between two trees is 10 meters. To maximize the number of trees, I should use the smallest possible spacing that meets the minimum requirement. So, the spacing between trees should be 10 meters.\n\nTo find out how many trees can be planted, I can divide the total perimeter by the spacing between trees:\n\nNumber of trees = Perimeter / spacing = 400 / 10 = 40 trees\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, when you plant trees in a loop (like around a perimeter), the number of trees is equal to the number of spaces between them because the first and last tree meet up. So, in a closed loop, the number of trees is equal to the perimeter divided by the spacing.\n\nBut, I should confirm this. Let's think about a smaller scale. Suppose the perimeter is 10 meters and the spacing is 10 meters. In that case, only one tree would be planted. But according to the formula above, Number of trees = 10 / 10 = 1 tree, which makes sense.\n\nAnother example: perimeter of 20 meters, spacing of 5 meters. Number of trees = 20 / 5 = 4 trees, spaced evenly around the perimeter.\n\nSo, in this case, with a perimeter of 400 meters and spacing of 10 meters, the number of trees would be 400 / 10 = 40 trees.\n\nBut, I should consider if there's a way to increase the number of trees while still maintaining the minimum distance of 10 meters between them.\n\nPerhaps by using a spacing less than 10 meters, but the problem states that the minimum distance between two adjacent trees must be at least 10 meters. So, to maximize the number of trees, I should use exactly 10 meters spacing.\n\nWait, but if I use a spacing greater than 10 meters, the distance between trees would still meet the minimum requirement, but the number of trees would decrease. So, to maximize the number of trees, I should use the smallest possible spacing, which is 10 meters.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of trees he can plant is 40.\n\nBut let me double-check this approach. Maybe there's a smarter way to arrange the trees to fit more in the same perimeter while maintaining the minimum distance.\n\nOne thing I can think of is arranging the trees in a way that some trees are closer to corners, but I don't think that would increase the total number if the spacing between adjacent trees still has to be at least 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different shape for planting, but the field is rectangular, so the perimeter is fixed.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the trees are planted along the perimeter path, and the perimeter is a closed loop.\n\nIn that case, the number of trees is indeed equal to the perimeter divided by the spacing.\n\nSo, 400 meters / 10 meters = 40 trees.\n\nAlternatively, if the trees were planted only at the corners, there would be 4 trees, but that would not maximize the number.\n\nOr, if trees were planted along each side with 10 meters spacing, I can calculate it that way to confirm.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor the longer sides (120 meters each):\n\nNumber of trees per long side = length / spacing + 1 = 120 / 10 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 trees\n\nBut wait, if I plant 13 trees on each long side, the spacing would be 10 meters between them.\n\nSimilarly, for the shorter sides (80 meters each):\n\nNumber of trees per short side = width / spacing + 1 = 80 / 10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 trees\n\nBut if I add up the trees on all four sides: 2 long sides * 13 trees + 2 short sides * 9 trees = 26 + 18 = 44 trees\n\nHowever, this counts the corner trees twice, once for each side that meets at the corner.\n\nSo, to correct for that, I need to subtract the 4 corner trees that were double-counted.\n\nTherefore, total number of trees = 44 - 4 = 40 trees\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation of perimeter / spacing = 400 / 10 = 40 trees.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of trees that can be planted along the perimeter with at least 10 meters between them is 40.\n\nBut let me consider if there's a way to arrange the trees more efficiently, perhaps using a different pattern, like a spiral or something, but given that they have to be along the perimeter, I don't think that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the trees were planted along the diagonals, but the problem specifies along the perimeter.\n\nSo, I think 40 is the correct and maximum number of trees that can be planted with at least 10 meters between each adjacent pair.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
