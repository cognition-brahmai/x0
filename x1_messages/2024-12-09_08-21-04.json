        "content": "So I've got this math problem here. It says that the derivative of a function measures how sensitive the output is to changes in the input. Okay, that makes sense. The function given is y = 3x\u00b2 + 2x - 1, and I need to find the derivative of y with respect to x. There are four options:\n\nA. 6x + 2\n\nB. 3x\u00b2 + 2\n\nC. 6x - 1\n\nD. 3x\u00b2 - 1\n\nAlright, let's recall how to find derivatives. I think the power rule is what I need here. The power rule says that if you have a function like x^n, its derivative is n*x^(n-1). Okay, so let's apply that to each term in the function.\n\nFirst term: 3x\u00b2. The derivative should be 3*2*x^(2-1) = 6x.\n\nSecond term: 2x. The derivative is 2*1*x^(1-1) = 2*1*x^0 = 2*1*1 = 2.\n\nThird term: -1. That's a constant, and the derivative of a constant is zero.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the derivative of y with respect to x should be 6x + 2.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option A. So, I think the answer is A. 6x + 2.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I forgot something. Is there any other rule I need to consider here? Like, are there any product rules, quotient rules, or chain rules involved? Hmm, no, this is just a polynomial, so the power rule should suffice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. 6x + 2: That's what I got.\n\nB. 3x\u00b2 + 2: That's part of the original function, not its derivative.\n\nC. 6x - 1: That's close to what I have, but the constant term should be +2, not -1.\n\nD. 3x\u00b2 - 1: Again, part of the original function, not the derivative.\n\nSo, definitely, A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with that. Derivatives can be tricky sometimes, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
