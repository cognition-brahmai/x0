        "content": "First, I need to find out the total area of the field. Since the field is rectangular, I can calculate the area by multiplying the length by the width.\n\nSo, the length is 200 meters and the width is 150 meters. Therefore, the total area is:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\nArea = 200 m \u00d7 150 m\nArea = 30,000 square meters\n\nNow, the farmer wants to plant corn in 40% of the field. To find out how much area that is, I need to calculate 40% of 30,000 square meters.\n\n40% of 30,000 m\u00b2 = 0.40 \u00d7 30,000 m\u00b2\n= 12,000 square meters\n\nSo, 12,000 square meters will be planted with corn.\n\nThe remaining area will be planted with wheat. To find the remaining area, I need to subtract the corn area from the total area.\n\nRemaining area = total area - corn area\nRemaining area = 30,000 m\u00b2 - 12,000 m\u00b2\n= 18,000 square meters\n\nTherefore, 18,000 square meters will be planted with wheat.\n\nBut let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, since 40% is planted with corn, the remaining percentage planted with wheat is 100% - 40% = 60%.\n\nSo, I can also calculate 60% of the total area to find the wheat planting area.\n\n60% of 30,000 m\u00b2 = 0.60 \u00d7 30,000 m\u00b2\n= 18,000 square meters\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the farmer will plant wheat in 18,000 square meters of the field.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18000} \\]"
