        "content": "Hmm, I think I've heard about this before. So, there's this famous fashion designer who made the \"little black dress\" really popular, and also created a perfume called No. 5. Let me see, is this about Coco Chanel? I think so, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up.\n\nOkay, so Coco Chanel is a well-known fashion designer from France. She started her career designing hats and then moved on to clothing. She's famous for creating the little black dress, which was a simple, elegant dress that became very popular and is still a staple in many wardrobes today.\n\nAlso, Chanel No. 5 is one of the best-selling perfumes of all time. It was the first fragrance that was created by a fashion designer, and it was launched in 1921. So, it seems like Coco Chanel is the person who fits this description.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there are other designers who are associated with little black dresses and famous perfumes. Let's think about Christian Dior \u2013 he's another famous French fashion designer. He's known for the \"New Look\" that he introduced after World War II, which emphasized a feminine silhouette with a nipped-in waist and full skirt. But I don't think he's the one who created the little black dress or a perfume called No. 5.\n\nThen there's Yves Saint Laurent, who was also a French designer. He's known for popularizing the tuxedo suit for women and introducing the concept of ready-to-wear clothing. Again, not directly associated with the little black dress or a perfume named No. 5.\n\nVersace is an Italian fashion house known for its bold prints and luxury goods, but I don't think they created the little black dress or a perfume called No. 5.\n\nSo, going back to Coco Chanel, it seems like she's the one who fits the description. She founded the Chanel brand, which is synonymous with luxury and elegance. The little black dress she designed was revolutionary because it went against the norm of elaborate, colorful dresses that were popular at the time. Her design was simple, versatile, and could be worn for both day and evening occasions.\n\nMoreover, Chanel No. 5 was a groundbreaking perfume because it was the first to use a combination of synthetic and natural ingredients, which gave it a unique scent that was different from the floral perfumes that were popular at the time.\n\nSo, to answer the question, the iconic fashion designer who created the little black dress and founded a luxury brand known for its perfume, No. 5, is Coco Chanel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Coco Chanel}} \\]"
