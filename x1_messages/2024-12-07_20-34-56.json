Each step will have an associated evidence value, which is the output from one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nSearchEngine[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using a general search engine. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebReader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkGrabber[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAnswerBot[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given #E1?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g. AnswerBot[What is the capital of Michigan, given #E3?]\n\nOnly include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E0\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what was their most famous work?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what their most famous work is. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020. I can probably find that through a quick search online. So, I'll use the SearchEngine tool to look up \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.\"\n\nOnce I have the name of the winner, I need to find out what their most famous work is. For that, I might need to look up more information about them, maybe read a biography or look at their list of publications. Maybe I can find a website that has this information.\n\nSo, plan is:\n\n1. Use SearchEngine to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020.\n\n2. Once I have the name, use that name to search for their most famous work.\n\n3. Maybe use WebReader to extract information from relevant websites.\n\n4. Finally, summarize the information to answer the question.\n\nLet me start with the first step.\n\n#E0 = SearchEngine[Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner]\n\nNow, based on the results from #E0, I can find the name of the winner. Let's assume the search results show that the winner was Louise Gl\u00fcck.\n\nNext, I need to find her most famous work. I can search for \"Louise Gl\u00fcck famous works\" or something similar.\n\nSo, the next step would be:\n\n#E1 = SearchEngine[Louise Gl\u00fcck famous works]\n\nThen, I can use LinkGrabber to extract relevant links from the search results.\n\n#E2 = LinkGrabber[#E1]\n\nAfter that, I can use WebReader to read the content from those links.\n\n#E3 = WebReader[#E2]\n\nFinally, I can use AnswerBot to analyze the text and find out what her most famous work is.\n\n#E4 = AnswerBot[What is Louise Gl\u00fcck's most famous work, given #E3?]\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nPlan: Search for the Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner.\n\n#E0 = SearchEngine[Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner]\n\nPlan: Search for the winner's famous works.\n\n#E1 = SearchEngine[Louise Gl\u00fcck famous works]\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the search results.\n\n#E2 = LinkGrabber[#E1]\n\nPlan: Read the content from the extracted links.\n\n#E3 = WebReader[#E2]\n\nPlan: Determine the most famous work of Louise Gl\u00fcck.\n\n#E4 = AnswerBot[What is Louise Gl\u00fcck's most famous work, given #E3?]\n\nFinal answer: #E4\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{#E4}} \\]"
