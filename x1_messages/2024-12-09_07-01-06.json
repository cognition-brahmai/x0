So, you're asking about an iconic landmark in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that's up on this mountain called Corcovado, and it's also one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Let me think about this for a second.\n\nI know that Rio de Janeiro is famous for its beautiful landscapes and architectural marvels. One of the first things that come to mind when I think about Rio is the Christ the Redeemer statue. Is that what you're referring to?\n\nChrist the Redeemer is this enormous Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ, and it's perched on top of Mount Corcovado, which overlooks the city. It was completed in 1931 and has since become a symbol not just of Rio, but of Brazil itself.\n\nI remember seeing pictures of it when I was younger, and it's absolutely breathtaking. The way it stands with its arms outstretched, it's like it's embracing the entire city. It must be incredible to see in person.\n\nNow, about the New Seven Wonders of the World. I think this list was created by the New7Wonders Foundation, which was founded by Swiss adventurer Bernard Weber. They conducted a worldwide poll where people could vote for their favorite landmarks to be included in this list.\n\nI believe the voting took place over several years, and Christ the Redeemer was ultimately selected as one of the winners. The other wonders on the list include the Great Wall of China, the Petra archaeological site in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, the Colosseum in Rome, Chichen Itza in Mexico, and the Taj Mahal in India.\n\nIt's interesting how these wonders represent different cultures and historical periods from around the globe. Christ the Redeemer, being a relatively modern structure compared to some of the others, still holds a significant place in global culture and heritage.\n\nI've heard that the statue is about 30 meters tall, including its base, and the arms stretch out about 28 meters. It's made of reinforced concrete and soapstone, which is a type of sedimentary rock that's easy to carve and resistant to weathering. That must have been quite an engineering feat back in the day.\n\nVisiting Christ the Redeemer is on my bucket list. I imagine the view from up there is just phenomenal, with the entire city spread out below and the lush forests surrounding the mountain. There must be a real sense of peace and spirituality up there.\n\nI've also read that sometimes, due to the weather, the statue can be shrouded in clouds, which must add to its mystique. It would be amazing to experience that firsthand.\n\nBesides the statue itself, I know that Corcovado mountain is part of the Tijuca Forest National Park, which is the largest urban forest in the world. So, apart from the historical and cultural significance, there's also a lot of natural beauty to appreciate.\n\nIf I ever get the chance to visit Rio de Janeiro, I would definitely make it a point to go see Christ the Redeemer. Maybe take a cable car up the mountain or even hike if I'm feeling adventurous.\n\nIn conclusion, the iconic landmark you're referring to is indeed Christ the Redeemer, situated on Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and it's one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It's a magnificent piece of art and engineering that represents not only Brazil but also the enduring power of human creativity and spirituality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Christ the Redeemer}} \\]"
