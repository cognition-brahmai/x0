        "content": "Alright, I've got this question: \"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\" Okay, first things first, I need to find out which building holds the title of the tallest in New York and then figure out when it was built. Since I don't know this off the top of my head, I'll need to look it up. I have some tools to help me with this: YahooSearch, TextScraper, HyperlinkGatherer, and QuerySolver.\n\nSo, starting with YahooSearch, I can use that to find websites that might have the information I need about the tallest building in New York. I'll input the question directly into YahooSearch to see what comes up.\n\nPlan: Use YahooSearch to find relevant websites.\n\n@Evidence0 = YahooSearch[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I'll need to pick out the most relevant links that likely contain the answer. Maybe the first few links are good enough. I can use HyperlinkGatherer to extract the links from the search results.\n\nPlan: Extract hyperlinks from the YahooSearch results.\n\n@Evidence1 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence0]\n\nNow, with these links, I need to visit the websites and scrape the text to get the information. TextScraper should do the job here. I'll input all the links from @Evidence1 into TextScraper to get the plain text content.\n\nPlan: Scrape text from the extracted links.\n\n@Evidence2 = TextScraper[@Evidence1]\n\nAt this point, I have a bunch of text from different websites. Now, I need to find the answer to the question within this text. QuerySolver seems perfect for this because it can answer questions based on a given context. I'll input the original question and refer to @Evidence2 as the context.\n\nPlan: Use QuerySolver to answer the question based on the scraped text.\n\n@Evidence3 = QuerySolver[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence2]\n\nHopefully, @Evidence3 will give me the name of the building and the year it was built. If not, I might need to refine my approach. Maybe I didn't get the right links or the text isn't clear enough. In that case, I could try searching again with a different query or look for more specific keywords.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on official New York city websites or well-known encyclopedia sites would provide more accurate information. I could modify my search query to include \"official\" or \"wikipedia\" to get more reliable sources.\n\nPlan (alternative): Search for official or Wikipedia sources.\n\n@Evidence4 = YahooSearch[\"tallest building in New York wikipedia\"]\n\nThen, extract the link to the Wikipedia page and scrape that page specifically.\n\nPlan (alternative): Extract and scrape the Wikipedia link.\n\n@Evidence5 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence4]\n\nAssuming the first link is the Wikipedia page, I can input that single link into TextScraper.\n\nPlan (alternative): Scrape the Wikipedia page.\n\n@Evidence6 = TextScraper[@Evidence5]\n\nFinally, use QuerySolver to extract the required information from the Wikipedia page.\n\nPlan (alternative): Use QuerySolver with the Wikipedia text.\n\n@Evidence7 = QuerySolver[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence6]\n\nThis might give a more precise answer since Wikipedia is a reliable source for such factual information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a official New York city website that lists the tallest buildings. I could search for \"New York city tallest buildings\" and look for official sources.\n\nPlan (another alternative): Search for official sources.\n\n@Evidence8 = YahooSearch[\"New York city tallest buildings official\"]\n\nThen, extract links and scrape text as before.\n\nPlan (another alternative): Extract and scrape official links.\n\n@Evidence9 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence8]\n\n@Evidence10 = TextScraper[@Evidence9]\n\nAnd then use QuerySolver.\n\nPlan (another alternative): Use QuerySolver with official text.\n\n@Evidence11 = QuerySolver[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence10]\n\nThis might provide another perspective or confirm the information from Wikipedia.\n\nTo make this more efficient, maybe I can combine the searches and scrape multiple sources to cross-verify the information.\n\nPlan: Combine multiple sources.\n\n- Search Yahoo for \"tallest building in New York\" to get general sources.\n\n- Search Yahoo for \"tallest building in New York wikipedia\" for Wikipedia source.\n\n- Search Yahoo for \"New York city tallest buildings official\" for official sources.\n\nThen, gather all the links, scrape the text, and use QuerySolver to analyze the combined context.\n\nPlan: Comprehensive approach.\n\n1. @Evidence0 = YahooSearch[\"tallest building in New York\"]\n\n2. @Evidence1 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence0]\n\n3. @Evidence2 = TextScraper[@Evidence1]\n\n4. @Evidence3 = YahooSearch[\"tallest building in New York wikipedia\"]\n\n5. @Evidence4 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence3]\n\n6. @Evidence5 = TextScraper[@Evidence4]\n\n7. @Evidence6 = YahooSearch[\"New York city tallest buildings official\"]\n\n8. @Evidence7 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence6]\n\n9. @Evidence8 = TextScraper[@Evidence7]\n\n10. Combine @Evidence2, @Evidence5, and @Evidence8 into a single context.\n\n11. @Evidence9 = QuerySolver[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence2 + @Evidence5 + @Evidence8]\n\nThis way, I'm gathering information from general sources, Wikipedia, and official sources, and then using QuerySolver to extract the answer from the combined context. This should increase the accuracy of the response.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use QuerySolver multiple times with different contexts and compare the answers.\n\nPlan: Cross-verify with multiple sources.\n\n1. @Evidence0 = YahooSearch[\"tallest building in New York\"]\n\n2. @Evidence1 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence0]\n\n3. @Evidence2 = TextScraper[@Evidence1]\n\n4. @Evidence3 = QuerySolver[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence2]\n\n5. @Evidence4 = YahooSearch[\"tallest building in New York wikipedia\"]\n\n6. @Evidence5 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence4]\n\n7. @Evidence6 = TextScraper[@Evidence5]\n\n8. @Evidence7 = QuerySolver[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence6]\n\n9. @Evidence8 = YahooSearch[\"New York city tallest buildings official\"]\n\n10. @Evidence9 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence8]\n\n11. @Evidence10 = TextScraper[@Evidence9]\n\n12. @Evidence11 = QuerySolver[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence10]\n\n13. Compare @Evidence3, @Evidence7, and @Evidence11 to find consistent information.\n\nThis way, I can check if all sources are pointing to the same building and the same construction year. If they all agree, I can be more confident in the answer.\n\nIn case there are discrepancies, I might need to look for more sources or consider the credibility of each source to determine the most accurate information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for sources that provide a list of the tallest buildings in New York with their heights and construction dates. Then, identify the building with the greatest height and note its construction date.\n\nPlan: Find a ranked list of tallest buildings.\n\n1. @Evidence0 = YahooSearch[\"tallest buildings in New York list\"]\n\n2. @Evidence1 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence0]\n\n3. @Evidence2 = TextScraper[@Evidence1]\n\n4. @Evidence3 = QuerySolver[\"What is the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence2]\n\nThis approach might be efficient because lists often clearly indicate the ranking of buildings by height.\n\nMoreover, such lists usually include multiple buildings with their heights and other details, making it easier to identify the tallest one and its construction date.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, the \"tallest building\" can be defined in different ways\u2014maybe considering spires, antennas, or just the architectural structure. I should make sure that the definition is consistent across sources.\n\nPlan: Consider different definitions of \"tallest.\"\n\n1. Search for \"tallest building in New York\" and look for sources that specify whether height includes spires or antennas.\n\n2. Check if there are any discrepancies in reported heights due to different measurement standards.\n\n3. Prefer sources that use the same definition to avoid confusion.\n\nThis might not be crucial for this question, but it's good to be aware of such nuances.\n\nAlso, considering that building heights and rankings can change over time with new constructions or alterations, it's important to refer to up-to-date sources.\n\nPlan: Ensure sources are recent.\n\n1. When searching, prefer sources with recent publication dates.\n\n2. Look for websites that are regularly updated, such as official city websites or reputable news organizations.\n\nThis helps in getting the most current information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a specific website or authority that maintains records of building heights in New York City. If I can find that, it would be an authoritative source for this information.\n\nPlan: Find authoritative sources.\n\n1. Search for \"New York City building height records\" or \"New York City skyscraper heights.\"\n\n2. Look for links to official city websites, architectural databases, or recognized authorities on building statistics.\n\n3. Scrape text from these sources and use QuerySolver to extract the required information.\n\nThis approach increases the reliability of the information.\n\nGiven all these considerations, I think the best plan is to search for a list of tallest buildings in New York, scrape the relevant text, and use QuerySolver to find the tallest building and its construction date from that list.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. @Evidence0 = YahooSearch[\"list of tallest buildings in New York\"]\n\n2. @Evidence1 = HyperlinkGatherer[@Evidence0]\n\n3. @Evidence2 = TextScraper[@Evidence1]\n\n4. @Evidence3 = QuerySolver[\"What's the tallest building in New York and when was it built?\", @Evidence2]\n\nIf @Evidence3 provides a clear and consistent answer across multiple sources, that should be the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: @Evidence3"
