The difference is in the shade of red.\n\nOxygenated blood, which is carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, is bright red. Deoxygenated blood, which is returning to the lungs to pick up more oxygen, is darker red.\n\nThe myth that blood is blue before it's oxygenated might come from the fact that veins, which carry deoxygenated blood, often appear blue through the skin. However, this is due to the way light penetrates the skin and is scattered, not because the blood itself is blue.\n\nSo, to summarize, blood is always some shade of red, never blue."
