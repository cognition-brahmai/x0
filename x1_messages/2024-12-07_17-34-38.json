To find the total cost before tax, I need to calculate the cost of the small widgets and the large widgets separately, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, for the small widgets:\n\nNumber of small widgets: 5\n\nCost per small widget: $4\n\nTotal cost for small widgets: 5 * $4 = $20\n\nNext, for the large widgets:\n\nNumber of large widgets: 3\n\nCost per large widget: $9\n\nTotal cost for large widgets: 3 * $9 = $27\n\nNow, to find the total cost before tax, I add the total cost of small widgets and the total cost of large widgets:\n\nTotal cost = $20 + $27 = $47\n\nSo, the total cost before tax is $47.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{47} \\]"
