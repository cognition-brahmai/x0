        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"Five machines can make five widgets in five minutes. How long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?\" Hmm, let's see. At first glance, it seems like a straightforward problem, but I want to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nSo, we know that five machines can produce five widgets in five minutes. I need to find out how long it would take for 100 machines to make 100 widgets. It looks like a problem about rates and proportions.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the rate at which one machine produces widgets. If five machines make five widgets in five minutes, then one machine would make one widget in five minutes, right? Because the number of machines and the number of widgets are both five, so they sort of cancel out.\n\nWait, let me think again. If five machines make five widgets in five minutes, that means collectively, they produce five widgets in five minutes. So, the rate for the group of five machines is five widgets per five minutes, which simplifies to one widget per machine per five minutes.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if five machines make five widgets in five minutes, then the rate per machine is:\n\nNumber of widgets per machine = total widgets / number of machines = 5 widgets / 5 machines = 1 widget per machine.\n\nAnd this happens in five minutes, so each machine makes one widget every five minutes.\n\nOkay, so one machine makes one widget every five minutes.\n\nNow, if I have 100 machines, and each machine makes one widget every five minutes, then all 100 machines working simultaneously would each produce one widget every five minutes.\n\nSo, in five minutes, 100 machines would produce 100 widgets, because each machine makes one widget in that time.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems almost too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the total machine-minutes required to produce the widgets.\n\nIf five machines make five widgets in five minutes, then the total machine-minutes is 5 machines * 5 minutes = 25 machine-minutes for five widgets.\n\nTherefore, the machine-minutes per widget is 25 machine-minutes / 5 widgets = 5 machine-minutes per widget.\n\nSo, to make one widget, it requires five machine-minutes.\n\nNow, if I need to make 100 widgets, the total machine-minutes required would be 100 widgets * 5 machine-minutes per widget = 500 machine-minutes.\n\nIf I have 100 machines working simultaneously, the time required would be total machine-minutes divided by the number of machines, which is 500 machine-minutes / 100 machines = 5 minutes.\n\nSo, both approaches lead me to the same conclusion: it would take five minutes for 100 machines to make 100 widgets.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. Is there any setup time, or is there a limit to how many machines can operate simultaneously? The problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so I'll assume that all machines can operate independently and simultaneously without any interference.\n\nAlso, I'm assuming that the machines are identical and each operates at the same rate. The problem states \"machines,\" so I'll assume they are all the same.\n\nAnother angle: if five machines make five widgets in five minutes, then one machine makes one widget in five minutes. Therefore, the time it takes for one machine to make one widget is five minutes.\n\nIf I have 100 machines, and each is making one widget, then since they all operate simultaneously, the time remains five minutes.\n\nSo, regardless of the number of machines, as long as they are working in parallel, the time to produce the widgets remains the same.\n\nWait, but actually, if I have more machines, I can produce more widgets in the same amount of time. But in this specific case, since the number of machines and the number of widgets both scale up by the same factor, the time remains constant.\n\nLet me compare it to a different scenario. Suppose I have one machine that makes one widget in five minutes. Then, if I have two machines, they can make two widgets in five minutes. Similarly, 100 machines can make 100 widgets in five minutes.\n\nSo, in general, the time remains the same as long as the number of machines and the number of widgets increase proportionally.\n\nAlternatively, if I had five machines and wanted to make 100 widgets, since five machines make five widgets in five minutes, to make 100 widgets, it would take 100/5 = 20 times longer, which would be 5 minutes * 20 = 100 minutes.\n\nBut in this case, since both the number of machines and the number of widgets are scaled up by the same factor, the time remains the same.\n\nWait, but in the previous thought, if five machines make five widgets in five minutes, then to make 100 widgets, it would take 100 minutes.\n\nBut in this problem, we have 100 machines making 100 widgets, which should take the same five minutes, because the machines are scaled up accordingly.\n\nSo, yes, the answer should be five minutes.\n\nLet me see if there's a formulaic way to approach this.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Number of machines: M\n\n- Number of widgets: W\n\n- Time: T\n\nFrom the given information:\n\n5 machines make 5 widgets in 5 minutes.\n\nSo, M1 = 5, W1 = 5, T1 = 5\n\nWe need to find T2 when M2 = 100, W2 = 100.\n\nAssuming that the production rate is directly proportional to the number of machines and the number of widgets, we can set up a proportion.\n\nOne way is to consider that the product of machines and time gives the total capacity to produce widgets.\n\nSo, M1 * T1 / W1 = M2 * T2 / W2\n\nBut does that make sense? Let's see.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n5 * 5 / 5 = 100 * T2 / 100\n\n25 / 5 = 100 * T2 / 100\n\n5 = T2\n\nSo, T2 = 5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that the time is inversely proportional to the number of machines for a given number of widgets.\n\nThat is, T \u221d W / M\n\nSo, T = k * W / M, where k is a constant.\n\nFrom the initial information:\n\n5 = k * 5 / 5\n\n5 = k * 1\n\nSo, k = 5\n\nThen, for M2 = 100, W2 = 100:\n\nT2 = 5 * 100 / 100 = 5 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the rate per machine.\n\nRate per machine: 1 widget per 5 minutes.\n\nTotal rate for 100 machines: 100 widgets per 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, to make 100 widgets, it would take 5 minutes.\n\nAll these approaches confirm that the time required is five minutes.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here and convinced myself that the answer is indeed five minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
