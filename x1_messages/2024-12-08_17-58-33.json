Each plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that enables users to search for information via DuckDuckGo search engine. It finds a list of sites that might have the answer to the user's question.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. Input is one or more links, and it produces plain text output containing the link contents.\nLinkCollector[input]: Extracts links from plain text and provides a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nQuerySolver[input]: A question-answering language model. Particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n#E1 = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [Next function to call and input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the tallest building in New York City and when was it completed?"
