Realism\n\nRealism in political science posits that the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no central authority above states to enforce rules or resolve disputes. In this environment, states are the primary actors, and they act primarily in their own self-interest to ensure their survival and security. Realists focus on power politics, national interest, and the balance of power as key determinants of state behavior in the international arena.\n"
