        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of friends going out for dinner, and they decide to split the bill evenly among themselves. Let's denote the original number of friends as \\( n \\) and the total bill as \\( b \\) dollars.\n\nGiven that they split the bill evenly, each person pays \\( \\frac{b}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nNow, the problem states two scenarios:\n\n1. If two more people had joined them, each person would pay $10 less.\n\n2. If three fewer people had come, each person would pay $15 more.\n\nLet's translate these scenarios into mathematical equations.\n\n**First Scenario:**\n\nIf two more people joined, the number of people becomes \\( n + 2 \\), and each person pays \\( \\frac{b}{n + 2} \\) dollars, which is $10 less than the original payment.\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{n + 2} = \\frac{b}{n} - 10\n\\]\n\n**Second Scenario:**\n\nIf three fewer people had come, the number of people becomes \\( n - 3 \\), and each person pays \\( \\frac{b}{n - 3} \\) dollars, which is $15 more than the original payment.\n\nSo, the equation for this scenario is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{n - 3} = \\frac{b}{n} + 15\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables, \\( n \\) and \\( b \\). Our goal is to solve for \\( n \\), the original number of friends.\n\nLet's look at these equations again:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{b}{n + 2} = \\frac{b}{n} - 10 \\)\n\n2. \\( \\frac{b}{n - 3} = \\frac{b}{n} + 15 \\)\n\nI think it might be easier to solve one of these equations for \\( b \\) and then substitute into the other equation.\n\nLet's start with the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{n + 2} = \\frac{b}{n} - 10\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( b \\):\n\nFirst, get rid of the denominators by multiplying both sides by \\( n(n + 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nb \\cdot n = b \\cdot (n + 2) - 10n(n + 2)\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nbn = bn + 2b - 10n^2 - 20n\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( bn \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = 2b - 10n^2 - 20n\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\n2b = 10n^2 + 20n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb = 5n^2 + 10n\n\\]\n\nAlright, now we have \\( b \\) in terms of \\( n \\). Let's substitute this expression for \\( b \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{n - 3} = \\frac{b}{n} + 15\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( b = 5n^2 + 10n \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n - 3} = \\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n} + 15\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n} = 5n + 10\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n - 3} = 5n + 10 + 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n - 3} = 5n + 25\n\\]\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by \\( n - 3 \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n5n^2 + 10n = (5n + 25)(n - 3)\n\\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[\n5n^2 + 10n = 5n^2 - 15n + 25n - 75\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5n^2 + 10n = 5n^2 + 10n - 75\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, something seems off. If I subtract \\( 5n^2 + 10n \\) from both sides, I get:\n\n\\[\n0 = -75\n\\]\n\nThat can't be right.

There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait a second, let's check the derivation of the two expressions for \\( b \\). From equation 1, I got \\( b = 5n^2 + 10n \\), and from equation 2, \\( b = 5n^2 - 15n \\). But these can't both be true unless \\( n = 0 \\), which is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my initial setup of the equations is incorrect. Maybe I need to reconsider how I'm interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me try approaching this differently. Perhaps I should consider the total bill \\( b \\) as a constant and find a relationship between the number of people and the payment per person.\n\nLet the original number of friends be \\( n \\), and the payment per person is \\( \\frac{b}{n} \\).\n\nIf two more people join, the number of people is \\( n + 2 \\), and the payment per person is \\( \\frac{b}{n + 2} \\), which is $10 less than the original payment:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{n + 2} = \\frac{b}{n} - 10\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, if three fewer people come, the number of people is \\( n - 3 \\), and the payment per person is \\( \\frac{b}{n - 3} \\), which is $15 more than the original payment:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{n - 3} = \\frac{b}{n} + 15\n\\]\n\nMaybe instead of solving for \\( b \\) in terms of \\( n \\), I can solve one equation for \\( b \\) and substitute into the other.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{n + 2} = \\frac{b}{n} - 10\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n(n + 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nb \\cdot n = b \\cdot (n + 2) - 10n(n + 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nbn = bn + 2b - 10n^2 - 20n\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( bn \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = 2b - 10n^2 - 20n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2b = 10n^2 + 20n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb = 5n^2 + 10n\n\\]\n\nNow, plug this expression for \\( b \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{n - 3} = \\frac{b}{n} + 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n - 3} = \\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n} + 15\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n} = 5n + 10\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n - 3} = 5n + 10 + 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5n^2 + 10n}{n - 3} = 5n + 25\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply both sides by \\( n - 3 \\):\n\n\\[\n5n^2 + 10n = (5n + 25)(n - 3)\n\\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[\n5n^2 + 10n = 5n^2 - 15n + 25n - 75\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5n^2 + 10n = 5n^2 + 10n - 75\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 5n^2 + 10n \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = -75\n\\]\n\nThis is not possible, indicating that there might be no solution, which contradicts the problem's premise. However, this suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the initial setup of the equations.\n\nLet me try a different approach.

But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider that the payment per person is inversely proportional to the number of people, but with the added constants, it complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider solving for \\( n \\) directly by eliminating \\( p \\) or \\( b \\).\n\nLet me go back to the two equations:\n\n1. \\( 0 = -10 n + 2 p - 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( 0 = 15 n - 3 p - 45 \\)\n\nLet me solve these two equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\[\n2 p = 10 n - 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 5 n - 10\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n\\[\n0 = 15 n - 3(5 n - 10) - 45\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 = 15 n - 15 n + 30 - 45\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 = -15\n\\]\n\nAgain, this is impossible. This suggests that there is no solution to the system of equations, which implies that the problem has no solution.\n\nHowever, since the problem is presented as having a solution, perhaps there is a different interpretation or a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me try assigning variables differently. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the original number of friends.\n\n- Let \\( p \\) be the original payment per person.\n\nThen, the total bill is \\( b = n p \\).\n\nFirst condition: If two more people join, each pays $10 less.\n\nSo, \\( n + 2 \\) people, each pays \\( p - 10 \\).\n\nThus, \\( b = (n + 2)(p - 10) \\).\n\nSecond condition: If three fewer people come, each pays $15 more.\n\nSo, \\( n - 3 \\) people, each pays \\( p + 15 \\).\n\nThus, \\( b = (n - 3)(p + 15) \\).\n\nNow, set up the equations:\n\n1. \\( n p = (n + 2)(p - 10) \\)\n\n2. \\( n p = (n - 3)(p + 15) \\)\n\nExpand equation 1:\n\n\\[\nn p = n p - 10 n + 2 p - 20\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( n p \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = -10 n + 2 p - 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 p = 10 n - 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 5 n - 10\n\\]\n\nExpand equation 2:\n\n\\[\nn p = n p + 15 n - 3 p - 45\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( n p \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = 15 n - 3 p - 45\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3 p = 15 n - 45\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 5 n - 15\n\\]\n\nNow, set the two expressions for \\( p \\):\n\n\\[\n5 n - 10 = 5 n - 15\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 5 n \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-10 = -15\n\\]\n\nThis is a contradiction, indicating that there is no solution.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there is a typo in the problem, or perhaps I need to consider that the number of people can't be less than or equal to 3 in the second condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the number of people must be greater than 3 to avoid negative or zero division in the equations.\n\nHowever, mathematically, it seems there is no solution. Perhaps the problem is misstated or there is an implicit assumption I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the total bill is a specific amount, but that seems unlikely without additional information.\n\nGiven that, I'm stuck. I can't find a valid number of friends that satisfies both conditions as presented.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No solution}} \\]"
