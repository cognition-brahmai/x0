        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 8 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 7 green balls. So, total number of balls is 8 + 5 + 7, which is 20 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing three balls at random without replacement, and getting exactly one ball of each color. Okay, that means one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when drawing three balls out of 20. Since the order doesn't matter, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 20 is C(20, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1140.\n\nSo, there are 1140 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 20.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing one ball of each color. So, one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red ball out of 8 is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one blue ball out of 5 is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one green ball out of 7 is C(7, 1) = 7.\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices:\n\n8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 280.\n\nSo, there are 280 ways to draw one ball of each color.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 280 / 1140.\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n280 \u00f7 20 = 14\n\n1140 \u00f7 20 = 57\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 14/57.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly one ball of each color is 14/57.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the different orders in which we can draw the balls. For example, red first, then blue, then green, or any other order. Since the order doesn't matter in this problem, but in probability without replacement, sometimes it's easier to consider ordered draws.\n\nSo, let's think about it that way.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is 8/20.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a blue ball second is 5/19, since one ball has already been drawn.\n\nFinally, the probability of drawing a green ball third is 7/18.\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (red, then blue, then green) is (8/20) \u00d7 (5/19) \u00d7 (7/18).\n\nBut, since the order doesn't matter, there are other sequences that also result in one ball of each color. Specifically, there are 3! = 6 possible orders: RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BGR, BRG.\n\nWait, but since we're dealing with without replacement, each sequence has the same probability.\n\nSo, the total probability is 6 \u00d7 (8/20 \u00d7 5/19 \u00d7 7/18).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, calculate 8/20 \u00d7 5/19 \u00d7 7/18:\n\n(8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7) / (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) = 280 / 6840.\n\nNow, multiply by 6:\n\n6 \u00d7 280 / 6840 = 1680 / 6840.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 120:\n\n1680 \u00f7 120 = 14\n\n6840 \u00f7 120 = 57\n\nSo, again, we get 14/57.\n\nOkay, that matches the previous result. Good, that gives me more confidence in the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red, one blue, and one green ball is C(8,1) \u00d7 C(5,1) \u00d7 C(7,1) = 8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 280, as before.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any three balls is C(20,3) = 1140.\n\nSo again, probability is 280 / 1140 = 14/57.\n\nAlright, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nSuppose I use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability of drawing one ball of each color in three draws without replacement.\n\nFirst draw: any ball, since there's no restriction on the first draw in terms of color.\n\nBut actually, it's easier to think in terms of the sequence of draws, considering the constraints.\n\nWait, I think I've already covered the main approaches, and they all lead to the same answer.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the probability is 14/57.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{57}} \\]"
