        "content": "Let's see. If I'm walking at a pace of 3.5 miles per hour for 2 hours and 45 minutes, I need to find out how many miles that would be. First, I should probably convert the time into hours since the speed is in miles per hour.\n\nSo, 2 hours and 45 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60, which is 0.75 hours. So, total time is 2 + 0.75 = 2.75 hours.\n\nNow, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, distance = 3.5 miles per hour times 2.75 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3.5 times 2.75.\n\nFirst, 3.5 times 2 is 7. Then, 3.5 times 0.75. What's 3.5 times 0.75?\n\nWell, 3.5 times 0.7 is 2.45, and 3.5 times 0.05 is 0.175. So, 2.45 plus 0.175 is 2.625.\n\nSo, 7 plus 2.625 is 9.625 miles.\n\nWait, but I can also do it differently. Maybe I should check my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, 3.5 miles per hour for 2.75 hours.\n\nAlternatively, 3.5 times 2 is 7, and 3.5 times 0.75 is 2.625, total 9.625 miles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in minutes.\n\n60 minutes is 1 hour, so 3.5 miles per 60 minutes.\n\nBut that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the time in hours and the speed in miles per hour, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the total distance walked would be 9.625 miles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can convert everything to minutes to double-check.\n\n2 hours and 45 minutes is 165 minutes.\n\n3.5 miles per hour is 3.5 miles per 60 minutes.\n\nSo, miles per minute is 3.5 divided by 60, which is 0.058333... miles per minute.\n\nThen, 0.058333 miles per minute times 165 minutes equals:\n\n0.058333 times 165.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n0.058333 times 100 is 5.8333.\n\n0.058333 times 60 is 3.5 miles per hour, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 0.058333 times 165.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as 3.5 miles per hour for 2.75 hours is indeed 3.5 times 2.75.\n\nAlternatively, 3.5 times 2 is 7, and 3.5 times 0.75 is 2.625, total 9.625 miles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of 2.75 hours as 11/4 hours, since 2.75 is 11/4.\n\nSo, 3.5 times 11/4.\n\n3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 times 11/4 is 77/8, which is 9.625 miles.\n\nSo, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the total distance walked is 9.625 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9.625} \\]"
