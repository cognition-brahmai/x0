I need to find out how many friends are in the group.\n\nSo, if each person contributes $12.50, and the total is $100, I think I can just divide the total amount by the contribution per person. That should give me the number of friends.\n\nSo, $100 divided by $12.50 per person.\n\nLet me do the math: 100 divided by 12.50.\n\nWell, 12.50 times 8 is 100, right? Because 12.50 times 8 is 100.\n\nSo, that means there are 8 friends in the group.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If each of 8 friends contributes $12.50, then 8 times 12.50 is indeed 100.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as finding how many 12.50's are there in 100.\n\nSo, 100 divided by 12.50.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to convert 12.50 to cents to make the division easier. 12.50 dollars is 1250 cents, and 100 dollars is 10,000 cents.\n\nSo, 10,000 cents divided by 1250 cents per person.\n\n10,000 divided by 1250 is 8.\n\nAgain, that gives me 8 friends.\n\nOr, I can think of 12.50 as 12 + 0.50, and see how many of those make 100.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can move the decimal places to make it easier: 12.50 is the same as 1250 divided by 100, so 100 divided by (1250/100) is the same as 100 * (100/1250) which is 10,000 / 1250, which is 8.\n\nSame answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, it seems like there are 8 friends in the group.\n\nI don't think there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 friends.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
