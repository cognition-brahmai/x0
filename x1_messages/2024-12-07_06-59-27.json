        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangular room that's 12 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I need to cover the entire floor with square tiles that are each 0.5 meters on each side. I need to figure out how many tiles I'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the area of the room and the area of one tile, and then see how many tiles fit into the room's area. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangular room is length times width, right? So, that would be 12 meters times 8 meters, which is 96 square meters.\n\nNow, each tile is a square that's 0.5 meters on each side. So, the area of one tile is 0.5 meters times 0.5 meters, which is 0.25 square meters.\n\nTo find out how many tiles I need, I can divide the total area of the room by the area of one tile. So, 96 square meters divided by 0.25 square meters per tile.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 96 divided by 0.25. Well, dividing by 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4, because 0.25 is a quarter. So, 96 times 4 is 384.\n\nSo, I need 384 tiles to cover the entire floor.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way could be to think about how many tiles fit along the length and how many fit along the width, and then multiply those two numbers.\n\nSo, the length of the room is 12 meters, and each tile is 0.5 meters long. So, the number of tiles along the length is 12 divided by 0.5, which is 24 tiles.\n\nSimilarly, the width of the room is 8 meters, and each tile is 0.5 meters wide. So, the number of tiles along the width is 8 divided by 0.5, which is 16 tiles.\n\nThen, the total number of tiles is 24 tiles along the length times 16 tiles along the width, which is also 384 tiles.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier using the area method. So, I'm pretty confident that 384 tiles is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any waste or if tiles need to be cut to fit around the edges, but the problem just asks for the number of tiles needed to cover the entire floor, assuming perfect fitting without any waste.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I need 384 tiles to cover the floor of the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{384} \\]"
