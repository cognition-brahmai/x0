        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company has a flat fee of $20 per day and an additional $0.15 per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 5 days and driving it for 300 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost of renting the car for 5 days. Since the flat fee is $20 per day, I'll multiply $20 by 5 days.\n\n$20/day * 5 days = $100\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost for driving 300 miles. The charge is $0.15 per mile, so I'll multiply $0.15 by 300 miles.\n\n$0.15/mile * 300 miles = $45\n\nNow, I'll add the two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\n$100 + $45 = $145\n\nSo, the total cost to rent the car for 5 days and drive it for 300 miles would be $145.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{145} \\]"
