HyperNut - The Overactive Squirrel\n\n---\n\n(Scene opens with SHELLSWORTH SENIOR sluggishly traversing the stage.)\n\nHYPERNUT (Bursting in): Yo, yo, yo! Shellsworth Senior! Guess what?\n\nSHELLSWORTH SENIOR (Groans deeply): What's the matter now, HyperNut?\n\nHYPERNUT: I just had a race with Cheetah Jerry and guess who came out on top!\n\nSHELLSWORTH SENIOR: Let me take a wild guess...Jerry?\n\nHYPERNUT: No! It was a draw! \n\nSHELLSWORTH SENIOR: A draw? How did you pull that off?\n\nHYPERNUT: Well, he got sidetracked by a butterfly.\n\n(SHELLSWORTH SENIOR chuckles)\n\nSHELLSWORTH SENIOR: You're fortunate, HyperNut. One of these days, your overactivity will land you in hot water.\n\nHYPERNUT: Oh, lighten up, Shellsworth Senior! Life's too fleeting to be sluggish and grumpy all the time.\n\nSHELLSWORTH SENIOR: And life's too extended to be speedy and careless all the time.\n\n(Enter LION, yawning audibly)\n\nLION: Can you two quiet down? Some of us are attempting to sleep here!\n\nHYPERNUT: Apologies, Lion! We'll try to lower our voices!\n\n(LION departs, shaking his head)\n\nSHELLSWORTH SENIOR: You see, HyperNut. That's precisely what I mean. Your liveliness bothers others.\n\nHYPERNUT: But Shellsworth Senior, isn't it preferable to live a short life full of thrill than a long one full of monotony?\n\nSHELLSWORTH SENIOR: Not if it implies bothering everyone else around you, HyperNut.\n\n(HYPERNUT appears pensive for a moment, then shrugs)\n\nHYPERNUT: Eh, I think I'll stick to my style. After all, you can't teach an old squirrel new tricks!\n\n(The curtain descends as SHELLSWORTH SENIOR shakes his head and HYPERNUT dashes offstage.)\n\n(END OF PLAY)"
