        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of candies: type X and type Y. Type X costs $2 each, and type Y costs $3 each. The customer buys a total of 15 candies and spends exactly $40. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of type X candies.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of type Y candies.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candies is 15. So, \\( x + y = 15 \\).\n\n2. The total cost is $40. Since type X candies cost $2 each and type Y candies cost $3 each, the total cost can be expressed as \\( 2x + 3y = 40 \\).\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 15 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 3y = 40 \\)\n\nWe need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 15 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 2(15 - y) + 3y = 40 \\)\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\( 30 - 2y + 3y = 40 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 30 + y = 40 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 30 from both sides:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nSo, the number of type Y candies is 10.\n\nNow, plug this back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x + 10 = 15 \\)\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\( x = 5 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 5 type X candies and 10 type Y candies.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it's correct. If they bought 5 type X candies at $2 each, that's \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) dollars. For type Y candies, 10 at $3 each is \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) dollars. Adding those up: \\( 10 + 30 = 40 \\) dollars, which matches the total spent. Also, \\( 5 + 10 = 15 \\) candies, which matches the total number of candies bought.\n\nSo, the solution is correct. The customer bought 5 type X candies and 10 type Y candies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ type X candies and } 10 \\text{ type Y candies}} \\]"
