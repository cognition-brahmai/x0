        "content": "So, there's this scenario where a group of people needs to split a bill evenly, and there's a tip involved too. Let's see: the total bill is $120, and they want to leave a 20% tip. There are 5 people in the group, and we need to find out how much each person should pay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly needs to be divided among the 5 people. Is it just the original bill, or is it the bill plus the tip? I think it's the total amount, which includes both the bill and the tip.\n\nSo, step one is to calculate the tip amount. The tip is 20% of the total bill. The total bill is $120, so the tip would be 20% of $120.\n\nTo calculate 20% of $120, I can multiply 120 by 0.20.\n\nLet me do that: 120 \u00d7 0.20 = 24. So, the tip is $24.\n\nNow, I need to add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount that needs to be paid.\n\nTotal amount = bill + tip = 120 + 24 = $144.\n\nAlright, now this $144 needs to be split evenly among 5 people.\n\nSo, to find out how much each person should pay, I need to divide the total amount by 5.\n\nSo, $144 divided by 5.\n\nLet me do the division: 144 \u00f7 5 = 28.8.\n\nTherefore, each person should pay $28.80.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, tip is 20% of $120, which is $24.\n\nTotal amount is $120 + $24 = $144.\n\nDivided by 5 people: $144 \u00f7 5 = $28.80 per person.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a method where you calculate the total amount each person needs to pay by considering the bill plus the tip as a single unit.\n\nSo, each person's share would be 1/5 of the total bill plus 1/5 of the tip.\n\nBut that seems more complicated than just calculating the total amount and then dividing it by 5.\n\nLet me see: 1/5 of $120 is $24, and 1/5 of $24 is $4.80. So, $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages.\n\nIf the total bill is $120, and they want to leave a 20% tip, the total amount is 120 \u00d7 1.20 = $144.\n\nThen, divide $144 by 5 to get $28.80 per person.\n\nThat's another way to look at it.\n\nI think no matter which way you approach it, the answer remains the same.\n\nTherefore, each person should pay $28.80.\n\nBut let me confirm one more thing.\n\nIs there any other factor that might affect this calculation?\n\nFor example, do they want to round up the amount for simplicity?\n\nOr is there tax involved that hasn't been mentioned?\n\nThe question seems straightforward: just the bill and the tip, split among 5 people.\n\nSo, unless there's additional information, $28.80 per person is the answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28.80} \\]"
