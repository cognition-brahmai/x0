        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing sports. There are 30 students in total. Out of these, 12 play football, 18 play basketball, and 8 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play any sport.\n\nSo, 12 play football and 18 play basketball. If I just add those two numbers together, I get 12 + 18 = 30. But wait, that's the same as the total number of students. Does that mean that all students play at least one sport? But then, there are 8 students who play both sports. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nI recall that when dealing with overlapping sets, I need to account for the overlap to avoid double-counting. So, if 8 students play both football and basketball, those students are included in both the football and basketball counts. Therefore, if I simply add 12 and 18, I'm counting those 8 students twice.\n\nTo correct for that, I need to subtract the number of students who play both sports from the total when I add the two groups together. So, the number of students who play at least one sport would be:\n\nNumber playing at least one sport = (Number playing football) + (Number playing basketball) - (Number playing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber playing at least one sport = 12 + 18 - 8 = 22\n\nSo, 22 students play either football or basketball or both.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play any sport, I subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\nNumber not playing any sport = Total students - Number playing at least one sport\n\nNumber not playing any sport = 30 - 22 = 8\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal students = 30\n\nFootball players = 12\n\nBasketball players = 18\n\nBoth sports = 8\n\nSo, number playing at least one sport = 12 + 18 - 8 = 22\n\nThen, students not playing any sport = 30 - 22 = 8\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sets. Let's denote:\n\nF = set of football players\n\nB = set of basketball players\n\nWe know that:\n\n|F| = 12\n\n|B| = 18\n\n|F \u2229 B| = 8\n\nWe want to find the number of students who don't play any sport, which is the number of students not in F or B, i.e., the complement of (F \u222a B).\n\nFirst, find |F \u222a B| = |F| + |B| - |F \u2229 B| = 12 + 18 - 8 = 22\n\nThen, the number not playing any sport is total students minus |F \u222a B| = 30 - 22 = 8\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the students who play only football, only basketball, and both, and then see how many are left who don't play any sport.\n\nNumber playing only football = total football players - those who play both = 12 - 8 = 4\n\nNumber playing only basketball = total basketball players - those who play both = 18 - 8 = 10\n\nNumber playing both = 8\n\nSo, total playing at least one sport = only football + only basketball + both = 4 + 10 + 8 = 22\n\nAgain, students not playing any sport = 30 - 22 = 8\n\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\nI think it's clear now that the number of students who don't play either sport is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
