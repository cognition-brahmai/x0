        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store selling apples and oranges. Apples are $1 each, and oranges are $2 each. Jane buys a total of 8 fruits and spends exactly $12. We need to find out how many apples and how many oranges she bought.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being asked. We need to find two numbers: the number of apples and the number of oranges. These two numbers should add up to 8 because she bought a total of 8 fruits. Also, the total cost of these fruits should be $12.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up. Maybe I can use some variables to represent the unknowns. Let's say:\n\n- Let A be the number of apples.\n\n- Let O be the number of oranges.\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\n1. A + O = 8 (because total fruits are 8)\n\n2. 1*A + 2*O = 12 (because apples are $1 each and oranges are $2 each, and total cost is $12)\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\nEquation 1: A + O = 8\n\nEquation 2: A + 2O = 12\n\nHmm, now I need to solve these two equations together to find the values of A and O.\n\nI know that in systems of equations, I can use either substitution or elimination method. Maybe I'll try the substitution method first.\n\nFrom Equation 1: A = 8 - O\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for A into Equation 2.\n\nSo, Equation 2 becomes: (8 - O) + 2O = 12\n\nLet's simplify that: 8 - O + 2O = 12\n\nCombining like terms: 8 + O = 12\n\nNow, subtract 8 from both sides: O = 4\n\nSo, Jane bought 4 oranges.\n\nNow, plug this back into Equation 1 to find A: A + 4 = 8 \u2192 A = 4\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf A = 4 and O = 4, then total fruits are 4 + 4 = 8, which matches.\n\nTotal cost is 1*4 + 2*4 = 4 + 8 = 12, which also matches.\n\nOkay, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the elimination method.\n\nLet's see: I have:\n\nEquation 1: A + O = 8\n\nEquation 2: A + 2O = 12\n\nIf I subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: (A + 2O) - (A + O) = 12 - 8\n\nWhich simplifies to: A + 2O - A - O = 4 \u2192 O = 4\n\nAgain, O = 4, and then A = 8 - 4 = 4.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nGood, both methods give me the same answer.\n\nIs there another way to think about this problem?\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of the difference in cost.\n\nApples are $1 each, oranges are $2 each. So, each orange costs $1 more than each apple.\n\nIf all 8 fruits were apples, the total cost would be 8 * $1 = $8.\n\nBut Jane spent $12, which is $4 more than $8.\n\nSince each orange costs $1 more than an apple, the $4 extra must come from the oranges.\n\nSo, number of oranges = $4 / $1 = 4.\n\nThen, number of apples = 8 - 4 = 4.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nThis is a nice check that my answer is consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I use trial and error.\n\nStart with assuming different numbers of apples and oranges that add up to 8 and see which combination gives $12.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 5 apples and 3 oranges: 5*1 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11 \u2192 too low.\n\n- 4 apples and 4 oranges: 4*1 + 4*2 = 4 + 8 = 12 \u2192 perfect.\n\n- 3 apples and 5 oranges: 3*1 + 5*2 = 3 + 10 = 13 \u2192 too high.\n\nSo, again, 4 apples and 4 oranges is the correct combination.\n\nThis reinforces my previous conclusion.\n\nIs there a graphical way to visualize this?\n\nYes, I can plot the two equations on a graph.\n\nLet\u2019s set up the axes: let\u2019s say A is on the x-axis and O is on the y-axis.\n\nEquation 1: A + O = 8\n\nThis is a straight line with intercepts at (8,0) and (0,8).\n\nEquation 2: A + 2O = 12\n\nThis is another straight line with intercepts at (12,0) and (0,6).\n\nThe point where these two lines intersect is the solution.\n\nLet\u2019s see: if A = 4, O = 4, that should be the intersection point.\n\nPlotting these lines would show that they intersect at (4,4), which matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, graphically too, the solution is 4 apples and 4 oranges.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the average cost per fruit.\n\nTotal cost is $12 for 8 fruits, so average cost per fruit is 12/8 = $1.50.\n\nSince apples are $1 and oranges are $2, the average cost suggests a mix of apples and oranges.\n\nIn this case, since $1.50 is exactly halfway between $1 and $2, it makes sense that the number of apples and oranges is equal, which is 4 each.\n\nThis is a nice intuition check.\n\nLet me consider if there are any constraints I should be aware of.\n\nFor example, can Jane buy negative fruits? No, that doesn't make sense. So, A and O must be non-negative integers.\n\nIn this case, A = 4 and O = 4 are both positive integers, so that's fine.\n\nAre there multiple solutions possible?\n\nIn this specific problem, it seems like there's only one solution that satisfies both equations.\n\nIf the numbers were different, maybe there could be multiple solutions, but here it's unique.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other combinations of A and O that satisfy both equations.\n\nFrom Equation 1: A = 8 - O\n\nPlugging into Equation 2: (8 - O) + 2O = 12 \u2192 8 + O = 12 \u2192 O = 4\n\nSo, O must be 4, and A must be 4.\n\nNo other values satisfy both equations simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the solution is unique.\n\nLet me also consider if the prices or the total amount spent allow for fractional fruits.\n\nBut since the problem states \"fruits,\" it's reasonable to assume that only whole numbers are allowed.\n\nSo, non-integer solutions wouldn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, 4 apples and 4 oranges is the only valid solution.\n\nIn conclusion, Jane bought 4 apples and 4 oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ apples and } 4 \\text{ oranges}} \\]"
