        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and we're drawing four cards at random. We want to find out the probability that all four of those cards are queens. There are four queens in a deck: the Queen of Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.\n\nFirst off, I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to draw four queens, and the total outcomes are all the possible ways to draw any four cards from the deck.\n\nLet me try to think of different methods to compute this.\n\n**Method 1: Using combinations**\n\nI remember that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here since we're just drawing four cards without regard to the order. The number of ways to choose four queens from the four available queens is C(4,4), which is 1, because there's only one way to choose all four queens. The total number of ways to choose any four cards from the deck is C(52,4). So, the probability should be C(4,4) divided by C(52,4).\n\nLet me calculate that. C(4,4) is 1, and C(52,4) is 52! / (4! * 48!) = (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 270725. So, the probability is 1/270725.\n\n**Method 2: Sequential probability**\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the probability of drawing a queen each time, step by step, without replacement. So, the probability that the first card is a queen is 4/52, since there are four queens out of 52 cards. Then, given that the first card was a queen, the probability that the second card is also a queen is 3/51, because there are now three queens left out of 51 cards. Similarly, the third card would be 2/50, and the fourth card would be 1/49.\n\nSo, the overall probability would be (4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) * (1/49). Let's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 4/52 simplifies to 1/13.\n\nThen, 1/13 * 3/51 = (1*3)/(13*51) = 3/663 = 1/221.\n\nNext, 1/221 * 2/50 = (1*2)/(221*50) = 2/11050 = 1/5525.\n\nFinally, 1/5525 * 1/49 = 1/270625.\n\nWait a minute, in Method 1 I got 1/270725, and now in Method 2 I got 1/270625. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nIn Method 1, C(52,4) is calculated as (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 270725. That seems correct.\n\nIn Method 2, (4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) * (1/49) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) = 24 / 6,497,400 = 1 / 270,725. Wait, now I'm getting 1/270,725 in both methods. Maybe I miscalculated earlier in Method 2.\n\nYes, earlier in Method 2, I simplified step by step, but I must have made an arithmetic error. Let's do the multiplication again:\n\n(4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) * (1/49) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) = 24 / 6,497,400 = 1 / 270,725.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is 1/270,725.\n\n**Method 3: Permutations**\n\nMaybe I can also think about this using permutations. Since the order doesn't matter, but let's see.\n\nThe number of ways to choose four queens in a specific order would be P(4,4) = 4! = 24.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any four cards in a specific order would be P(52,4) = 52 * 51 * 50 * 49.\n\nSo, the probability would be P(4,4) / P(52,4) = 24 / (52 * 51 * 50 * 49) = 24 / 6,497,400 = 1 / 270,725.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\n**Method 4: Complementary counting**\n\nHmm, maybe I can try to calculate the probability by considering the complementary events, but that seems more complicated for this problem. The complementary event would be drawing four cards where not all are queens, which includes a lot of possibilities. It's probably easier to stick with the direct methods.\n\n**Method 5: Using binomial coefficients for each draw**\n\nAnother way is to think of it step by step, similar to Method 2, but using binomial coefficients.\n\nThe probability of drawing a queen on the first draw is 4/52.\n\nThen, given that, the probability of drawing another queen is 3/51, and so on, just like in Method 2. So, this would essentially be the same as Method 2.\n\n**Comparison of methods**\n\n- **Method 1 (combinations)**: This is straightforward and concise. It directly applies the concept of combinations to calculate the probability. It's easy to understand and less error-prone because it involves fewer steps.\n\n- **Method 2 (sequential probability)**: This method breaks down the process step by step, which can be helpful for understanding the sequence of events. However, it involves more calculations and a higher chance of arithmetic errors.\n\n- **Method 3 (permutations)**: This method is similar to Method 2 but uses permutations instead of combinations. It's a bit more complicated because it considers order, which isn't necessary for this problem.\n\n- **Method 4 (complementary counting)**: This method is not efficient for this problem because the complementary event includes many possibilities, making the calculation more complex without any clear advantage.\n\n- **Method 5 (binomial coefficients for each draw)**: This is essentially the same as Method 2, just framed differently. It doesn't offer any new insights and is equally prone to calculation errors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAmong these methods, Method 1 (using combinations) is the most straightforward and least error-prone. It directly applies the fundamental probability formula using combinations, which is appropriate for this scenario where order doesn't matter. Therefore, the most correct and comprehensible computation is Method 1, yielding a probability of 1 in 270,725."
