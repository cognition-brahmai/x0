        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know there are 450 students in total, and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. That means for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. So, the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, if 5 parts represent the total number of students, which is 450, then one part must be 450 divided by 5. Let's calculate that:\n\n450 \u00f7 5 = 90\n\nSo, one part is 90 students.\n\nNow, since there are 3 parts for boys, the number of boys would be 3 times 90, and for girls, it's 2 times 90.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nBoys: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n\nGirls: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n\nSo, there are 270 boys and 180 girls in the school.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that to make sure it's correct. If we add 270 boys and 180 girls, we get:\n\n270 + 180 = 450\n\nThat matches the total number of students, so it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could use proportions to solve this. The ratio of boys to total students is 3 out of 5, and girls are 2 out of 5.\n\nSo, the number of boys would be 3/5 of the total students, and girls would be 2/5.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nBoys: (3/5) \u00d7 450 = (3 \u00d7 450) / 5 = 1350 / 5 = 270\n\nGirls: (2/5) \u00d7 450 = (2 \u00d7 450) / 5 = 900 / 5 = 180\n\nAgain, we get the same numbers: 270 boys and 180 girls.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. If the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2, then the fraction of students who are boys is 3/5, and girls is 2/5.\n\nSo, boys: 3/5 of 450 = 270\n\nGirls: 2/5 of 450 = 180\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, we could set up equations to solve this.\n\nLet\u2019s let the number of boys be 3x and the number of girls be 2x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nThen, 3x + 2x = 450\n\n5x = 450\n\nx = 450 / 5 = 90\n\nSo, boys: 3x = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n\nGirls: 2x = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same numbers.\n\nI think it's clear that there are 270 boys and 180 girls in the school.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the ratio. Sometimes ratios can be tricky, but in this case, it's straightforward. The ratio 3:2 means boys to girls, so 3 parts boys and 2 parts girls, totaling 5 parts.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the ratio multiplier. We know that 3x + 2x = 450, which simplifies to 5x = 450, so x = 90, and then multiply back to find the number of boys and girls.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to use percentages, boys make up 60% of the students (since 3 out of 5 is 60%), and girls make up 40%.\n\nSo, boys: 60% of 450 = 0.6 \u00d7 450 = 270\n\nGirls: 40% of 450 = 0.4 \u00d7 450 = 180\n\nOnce again, we get the same numbers.\n\nI think it's safe to say that there are 270 boys and 180 girls in the school.\n\nJust for completeness, let's consider if the ratio was reversed, but in the problem, it explicitly says the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2, so it's not reversed.\n\nIf it were girls to boys, it would be 2:3, but it's not the case here.\n\nSo, sticking with the given ratio of 3:2 for boys to girls, the answer remains 270 boys and 180 girls.\n\nOne more thing to consider: sometimes ratios can be given in different terms, like \"for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls,\" which is the same as 3:2.\n\nAlternatively, it could be expressed as \"the ratio of boys to girls is 3 to 2,\" which is again the same.\n\nSo, no matter how it's phrased, the ratio remains 3:2 for boys to girls.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys is 270 and the number of girls is 180.\n\nI think that's pretty much all the angles to cover for this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270 \\text{ boys and } 180 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
