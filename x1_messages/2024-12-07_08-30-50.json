        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a town, there are 100 people. Among them, 45 people have cats, 60 people have dogs, and 20 people have both cats and dogs. I need to find out how many people don't have either a cat or a dog.\n\nOkay, so it seems like a problem about sets and maybe using Venn diagrams to figure out the overlaps. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try.\n\nFirst, there are 100 people in total. Out of these, some have cats, some have dogs, and some have both.\n\nI know that if someone has both a cat and a dog, they are included in both the cat group and the dog group. So, if I just add the number of people who have cats and the number who have dogs, I would be double-counting those who have both.\n\nSo, to find out how many people have either a cat or a dog or both, I should add the number of cat owners and the number of dog owners and then subtract those who have both, so I don't double-count them.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of people who have either a cat or a dog or both = Number of cat owners + Number of dog owners - Number of people who have both cats and dogs.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 45 (cats) + 60 (dogs) - 20 (both)\n\n= 105 - 20\n\n= 85\n\nSo, 85 people have either a cat, a dog, or both.\n\nNow, to find out how many people don't have either, I subtract this number from the total number of people in the town.\n\nNumber of people who don't have either = Total number of people - Number of people who have either a cat or a dog or both.\n\n= 100 - 85\n\n= 15\n\nTherefore, 15 people in the town don't have either a cat or a dog.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal people = 100\n\nCat owners = 45\n\nDog owners = 60\n\nBoth = 20\n\nSo, people who only have cats = cat owners - both = 45 - 20 = 25\n\nPeople who only have dogs = dog owners - both = 60 - 20 = 40\n\nPeople who have both = 20\n\nTotal people who have pets = only cats + only dogs + both = 25 + 40 + 20 = 85\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, people without pets = total - pet owners = 100 - 85 = 15\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle, which is basically what I did. The formula is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A| is the number of people who have cats\n\n- |B| is the number of people who have dogs\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of people who have both cats and dogs\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the number of people who have either cats or dogs or both\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n|A \u222a B| = 45 + 60 - 20 = 85\n\nAnd then, people without pets = total - |A \u222a B| = 100 - 85 = 15\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nI think 15 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
