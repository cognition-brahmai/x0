Hmm, okay, let's think of something clever and tricky, but not too hard to figure out.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\nI'm a force that can make things fly,\nOr cause trees to sway in the sky.\nI can be gentle like a breeze,\nOr strong enough to uproot trees.\n\nWhat am I?\n\nSo, in this riddle, the answer would be \"\u98ce\" (F\u0113ng), which means \"wind\" in Chinese, and it starts with the letter F. The riddle describes wind's ability to make things fly, like kites or leaves, and to move trees. It can be gentle, like a soft breeze, or strong, capable of uprooting trees during a storm. This should give the user a good hint to guess the answer.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like me to include in the riddle, or any particular theme you have in mind?"
