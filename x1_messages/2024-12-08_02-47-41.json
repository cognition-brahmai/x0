        "content": "So there are 100 employees in a company, and each one sends an email to every other employee exactly once. I need to figure out how many emails are sent in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"every other employee\" means. If there are 100 employees, then each one will send emails to 99 others, right? Because they don't send an email to themselves.\n\nSo, if each of the 100 employees sends 99 emails, then total emails would be 100 times 99, which is 9,900. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Is there something I'm missing here?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose there are only a few employees. Let's say there are 3 employees: A, B, and C.\n\n- A sends emails to B and C (2 emails)\n\n- B sends emails to A and C (2 emails)\n\n- C sends emails to A and B (2 emails)\n\nSo total emails sent would be 6. But actually, A to B is the same as B to A, but in this case, since each sends to each other separately, it's 2 emails for every pair.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each employee sends an email to every other employee once, meaning A sends to B, and B sends to A, both are counted separately.\n\nSo, in the case of 3 employees, it's 3 * 2 = 6 emails.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 employees, it would be 4 * 3 = 12 emails.\n\nSo, generalizing, for n employees, total emails would be n * (n - 1).\n\nIn this problem, n is 100, so 100 * 99 = 9,900.\n\nBut earlier, I had a doubt if there was something missing. Maybe I need to consider that emails are being sent in both directions, but no, since each sending is counted separately.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem said that each employee sends one email to every other employee, but didn't specify direction, maybe it could be interpreted differently. But here, it clearly says \"each employee sends an email to every other employee once.\"\n\nSo, I think 9,900 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is through combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 employees where order matters (since A sending to B is different from B sending to A) is permutations.\n\nThe formula for permutations is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!.\n\nHere, n is 100 and k is 2, since each email involves 2 employees: the sender and the receiver.\n\nSo, P(100, 2) = 100! / 98! = 100 * 99 = 9,900.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using graph theory. If each employee is a node, and each email is a directed edge, then the total number of directed edges in a complete directed graph with 100 nodes is 100 * 99 = 9,900.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the total number of emails sent is 9,900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9900} \\]"
