        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 families in the village, and each family has 2 children. So, the total number of children in the village is 4 families \u00d7 2 children per family, which equals 8 children.\n\nNow, half of these children have blue eyes, and the other half have brown eyes. So, the number of blue-eyed children is 8 \u00f7 2 = 4, and the number of brown-eyed children is also 4.\n\nIf one child from each family moves away, and there are 4 families, then a total of 4 children move away. So, the number of children remaining in the village is 8 - 4 = 4.\n\nThe question is asking for the ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed children remaining in the village. But here's the thing: we don't know anything about the eye colors of the children who moved away. They could have been all blue-eyed, all brown-eyed, or a mix of both.\n\nSince we don't have any information about which children moved away, we have to assume that the children who stayed are a random selection from the original group. But wait, that might not be the case because the problem doesn't specify anything about the selection process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies that one child from each family moves away, and since each family has two children, perhaps one of each eye color from each family moves away. But that's assuming that each family has one blue-eyed and one brown-eyed child, which isn't necessarily true based on the information given.\n\nLet me go back to the beginning. Each family has 2 children, and half of all the children in the village have blue eyes and half have brown eyes. So, overall, there are 4 blue-eyed and 4 brown-eyed children among the 8.\n\nIf one child from each family moves away, and there are 4 families, then 4 children move away, leaving 4 children in the village.\n\nWithout additional information about the distribution of eye colors within each family, it's impossible to determine exactly how many blue-eyed and brown-eyed children remain.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a way to approach this probabilistically. If we assume that each child has an equal chance of moving away, regardless of eye color, then the remaining children should maintain the same ratio of eye colors as the original group.\n\nIn other words, since originally half the children have blue eyes and half have brown eyes, the remaining children should also have half blue-eyed and half brown-eyed, assuming a random selection.\n\nSo, if 4 children remain, and half have blue eyes, that would be 2 blue-eyed and 2 brown-eyed children remaining.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed children remaining in the village would be 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1.\n\nBut is this the correct approach? Maybe there's a different way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider the possible distributions of eye colors within the families.\n\nEach family has 2 children. There are a few possible combinations for each family:\n\n1. Both children have blue eyes.\n\n2. Both children have brown eyes.\n\n3. One child has blue eyes and the other has brown eyes.\n\nNow, since half of all children in the village have blue eyes and half have brown eyes, the distribution across families must average out to an equal number of each eye color.\n\nBut without knowing how the eye colors are distributed within each family, it's difficult to determine exactly how many children of each eye color remain after one from each family moves away.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider all possible scenarios.\n\nLet's denote B for blue-eyed and R for brown-eyed.\n\nPossible family compositions:\n\n- Family 1: BB\n\n- Family 2: BB\n\n- Family 3: RR\n\n- Family 4: RR\n\nIn this case, if one child from each family moves away, and assuming they take one B from each BB family and one R from each RR family, then the remaining children would be:\n\n- Family 1: B\n\n- Family 2: B\n\n- Family 3: R\n\n- Family 4: R\n\nSo, remaining children: 2B and 2R, ratio 1:1.\n\nAnother possible composition:\n\n- Family 1: BB\n\n- Family 2: BR\n\n- Family 3: BR\n\n- Family 4: RR\n\nTotal children: 2B + 1B+1R + 1B+1R + 2R = 4B and 4R, which matches the given.\n\nIf one child moves away from each family:\n\n- Family 1: BB, remove one B \u2192 remaining B\n\n- Family 2: BR, remove one child: could be B or R\n\n- Family 3: BR, remove one child: could be B or R\n\n- Family 4: RR, remove one R \u2192 remaining R\n\nSo, the remaining children would be:\n\n- Family 1: B\n\n- Family 2: B or R\n\n- Family 3: B or R\n\n- Family 4: R\n\nThus, possible remaining combinations:\n\n1. B (F1), B (F2), B (F3), R (F4) \u2192 3B and 1R\n\n2. B (F1), B (F2), R (F3), R (F4) \u2192 2B and 2R\n\n3. B (F1), R (F2), B (F3), R (F4) \u2192 2B and 2R\n\n4. B (F1), R (F2), R (F3), R (F4) \u2192 1B and 3R\n\nSo, in this scenario, the ratio could be 3:1 or 1:1 or 1:3, depending on which children move away.\n\nWait a minute, this suggests that without additional information, the ratio could vary.\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that there is a specific answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's assumed that the children who move away are randomly selected, and we're to find the expected ratio.\n\nIn that case, since the original ratio is 1:1, and children are selected randomly, the expected ratio should remain 1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's assumed that from each family, one child of each eye color moves away, but that doesn't make sense because each family has only 2 children.\n\nWait, if each family has two children, and one moves away, then the remaining child in each family is one of the two.\n\nBut without knowing the composition of each family, it's impossible to determine the eye color of the remaining child.\n\nHowever, if we assume that each family has one blue-eyed and one brown-eyed child, then when one child moves away from each family, the remaining children would be either all blue-eyed or all brown-eyed, depending on which child was removed.\n\nBut that assumption may not be accurate, as the problem states that half of the children in the village have blue eyes and half have brown eyes, but doesn't specify the distribution within families.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the families are such that two families have two blue-eyed children each, and the other two families have two brown-eyed children each. In that case, if one child moves away from each family, the remaining children would be one blue-eyed from each of the blue-eyed families and one brown-eyed from each of the brown-eyed families, resulting in two blue-eyed and two brown-eyed children remaining, maintaining the 1:1 ratio.\n\nBut again, this is just one possible scenario.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the distribution of eye colors within families, it seems that the safest assumption is that the ratio remains 1:1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed children remaining in the village is 1:1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1:1} \\]"
