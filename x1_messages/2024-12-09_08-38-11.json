First, we need to find out how much revenue is generated from each product separately and then add them together.\n\nFor product A:\n- The factory produces 500 units each day.\n- Each unit sells for $10.\n\nSo, the daily revenue from product A is:\n500 units * $10/unit = $5,000\n\nFor product B:\n- The factory produces 300 units each day.\n- Each unit sells for $15.\n\nSo, the daily revenue from product B is:\n300 units * $15/unit = $4,500\n\nNow, to find the combined daily revenue from both products, we add the revenues together:\n\n$5,000 (from A) + $4,500 (from B) = $9,500\n\nTherefore, the combined daily revenue from both products is $9,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9500} \\]"
