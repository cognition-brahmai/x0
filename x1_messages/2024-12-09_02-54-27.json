        "content": "Let's see. Alice bought 4 fruits in total, and they cost $6 altogether. Apples are $1 each and oranges are $2 each. I need to figure out how many apples she bought.\n\nFirst, let's think about this. If she bought all apples, that would be 4 apples at $1 each, totaling $4. But she spent $6, so that's not enough. If she bought all oranges, that would be 4 oranges at $2 each, totaling $8. That's too much. So she must have bought some apples and some oranges.\n\nLet me try to set up some equations here. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let A be the number of apples.\n\n- Let O be the number of oranges.\n\nWe know that:\n\n1. A + O = 4 (because she bought 4 fruits in total)\n\n2. 1*A + 2*O = 6 (because apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each, and the total cost is $6)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. A + O = 4\n\n2. A + 2O = 6\n\nHmm, how can I solve these equations?\n\nWell, I can subtract the first equation from the second one to eliminate A.\n\nSo, (A + 2O) - (A + O) = 6 - 4\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nA + 2O - A - O = 2\n\nSo, O = 2\n\nOkay, so she bought 2 oranges.\n\nNow, plug that back into the first equation:\n\nA + 2 = 4\n\nSo, A = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nTherefore, Alice bought 2 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that.\n\nIf she bought 2 apples at $1 each, that's $2, and 2 oranges at $2 each, that's $4, so total $6. Yeah, that matches.\n\nIs there another way to solve this?\n\nMaybe I can try different numbers.\n\nSuppose she bought 1 apple and 3 oranges.\n\nThat would be 1*1 + 3*2 = 1 + 6 = $7, which is too much.\n\nOr 3 apples and 1 orange: 3*1 + 1*2 = 3 + 2 = $5, which is too little.\n\nOr 0 apples and 4 oranges: 0*1 + 4*2 = 0 + 8 = $8, too much.\n\nOr 4 apples and 0 oranges: 4*1 + 0*2 = 4 + 0 = $4, too little.\n\nSo, only 2 apples and 2 oranges add up to $6.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of the extra cost of oranges.\n\nEach orange costs $1 more than an apple.\n\nShe spent $6 for 4 fruits.\n\nIf all were apples, it would cost $4.\n\nThe extra $2 must have come from the oranges, since each orange adds an extra $1.\n\nSo, number of oranges is $2 extra / $1 extra per orange = 2 oranges.\n\nTherefore, A = 4 - 2 = 2 apples.\n\nYeah, that makes sense too.\n\nSo, the answer is 2 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
