        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 10 red balls, 20 blue balls, and 15 green balls. So, in total, there are 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 balls in the bag. The question is, if I pick one ball at random, what's the probability that it's not red?\n\nOkay, probability. I remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is 45, since there are 45 balls in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where I don't pick a red ball. So, that means I can pick either a blue ball or a green ball.\n\nThere are 20 blue balls and 15 green balls, so the total number of favorable outcomes is 20 + 15 = 35.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a ball that's not red is 35/45.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. Both 35 and 45 are divisible by 5.\n\n35 \u00f7 5 = 7\n\n45 \u00f7 5 = 9\n\nSo, 35/45 simplifies to 7/9.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? I know that the probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event happening. So, the probability of not picking a red ball should be equal to 1 minus the probability of picking a red ball.\n\nLet me check if I get the same answer this way.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 10/45.\n\nSimplify that: 10 \u00f7 5 = 2, and 45 \u00f7 5 = 9, so 10/45 is 2/9.\n\nThen, the probability of not picking a red ball is 1 - 2/9.\n\n1 is the same as 9/9, so 9/9 - 2/9 = 7/9.\n\nCool, I get the same answer both ways. That gives me more confidence that 7/9 is the correct probability.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Is there any possibility that there are balls of other colors or any trick in the problem? Doesn't seem like it. The problem clearly states there are only red, blue, and green balls, and we're to pick one at random.\n\nAlso, since the balls are picked without looking, we can assume that each ball has an equal chance of being picked, so our approach is valid.\n\nSo, the probability that the ball picked is not red is 7/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{9}} \\]"
