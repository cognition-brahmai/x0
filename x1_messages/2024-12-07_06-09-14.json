        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular garden that's currently 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The owner wants to increase its area by 50% by extending it in only one direction, either lengthwise or widthwise. We need to figure out how many meters to extend it in the chosen direction.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width, right? So, the current area is 30 meters * 20 meters = 600 square meters.\n\nNow, the owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, we need to find what 50% of the current area is and then add that to the current area to find the new area.\n\n50% of 600 square meters is 0.5 * 600 = 300 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the new area should be 600 + 300 = 900 square meters.\n\nOkay, now the garden is to be extended in only one direction, either lengthwise or widthwise. We need to consider both options and see which one makes more sense or which one is being asked for. But since the problem doesn't specify which direction to extend, we can choose either. Maybe we should consider both to see the difference.\n\nLet's first consider extending the length.\n\nIf we extend the length, the width remains the same at 20 meters, and the new length will be 30 meters + x meters, where x is the extension we need to find.\n\nSo, the new area would be (30 + x) meters * 20 meters = 900 square meters.\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\n(30 + x) * 20 = 900\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 20:\n\n30 + x = 900 / 20\n\n30 + x = 45\n\nThen, subtract 30 from both sides:\n\nx = 45 - 30\n\nx = 15 meters\n\nSo, if extending lengthwise, the garden needs to be extended by 15 meters.\n\nNow, let's consider extending the width.\n\nIf we extend the width, the length remains the same at 30 meters, and the new width will be 20 meters + y meters, where y is the extension we need to find.\n\nSo, the new area would be 30 meters * (20 + y) meters = 900 square meters.\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n30 * (20 + y) = 900\n\nDivide both sides by 30:\n\n20 + y = 900 / 30\n\n20 + y = 30\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\ny = 30 - 20\n\ny = 10 meters\n\nSo, if extending widthwise, the garden needs to be extended by 10 meters.\n\nInteresting, so extending the width by 10 meters or the length by 15 meters both result in the same new area of 900 square meters, which is a 50% increase from the original area.\n\nBut the problem says to extend it in only one direction. It doesn't specify which one to choose, but perhaps there's a preference or a standard approach.\n\nMaybe we should consider which option is more practical or which one results in a more desirable shape for the garden.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to choose one and justify it.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't ask for justification, just how many meters to extend in the chosen direction.\n\nSo, perhaps we can choose either, but maybe it's better to consider both options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to generalize it.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the extension amount as x meters, and the direction to extend as either length or width.\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n1. Extending the length: new length = 30 + x, width remains 20.\n\nNew area = (30 + x) * 20 = 900\n\n2. Extending the width: new width = 20 + x, length remains 30.\n\nNew area = 30 * (20 + x) = 900\n\nWe already solved both equations and got x=15 for lengthwise extension and x=10 for widthwise extension.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to approach this without considering both separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of ratios or percentages.\n\nThe original area is 600 square meters, and we need to increase it by 50%, so to 900 square meters, as we've already determined.\n\nIf we're extending in only one direction, that means we're keeping one dimension constant and changing the other.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the constant dimension as a and the changing dimension as b.\n\nSo, original area: a * b = 600\n\nNew area: a * (b + x) = 900\n\nWhere x is the extension.\n\nSo, a * (b + x) = 900\n\nBut a * b = 600, so substitute:\n\n600 + a * x = 900\n\nTherefore, a * x = 300\n\nSo, x = 300 / a\n\nNow, depending on which dimension we choose to be constant, a, we get different x.\n\nIf we choose a = 20 meters (width remains constant), then:\n\nx = 300 / 20 = 15 meters\n\nWhich matches our earlier result for extending the length.\n\nIf we choose a = 30 meters (length remains constant), then:\n\nx = 300 / 30 = 10 meters\n\nWhich matches our earlier result for extending the width.\n\nSo, this generalized approach confirms our previous calculations.\n\nNow, since the problem says \"extend it in only one direction,\" but doesn't specify which one, perhaps we can choose either.\n\nBut maybe there's an implication or a standard practice in such problems.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider extending the longer side or the shorter side.\n\nIn this case, the length is longer (30 meters vs. 20 meters), so extending the longer side by 15 meters or the shorter side by 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a consideration of available space or cost, but that's not mentioned.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects us to choose one and state it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's intended to have both options presented.\n\nBut to answer the question directly, \"how many meters should the garden be extended in the chosen direction?\", we can provide the specific values for each direction.\n\nSo, if extending lengthwise, extend by 15 meters.\n\nIf extending widthwise, extend by 10 meters.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify which direction to extend, perhaps the answer should include both possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes extending the length, given it's usually referred to first.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps we should present both options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem specifies to extend in only one direction, but doesn't specify which one, so maybe the approach is to consider the extension in terms of the ratio of the sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical relationship that can be exploited to find a general solution.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nGiven that we have two scenarios and both lead to different extension amounts, perhaps the answer is to present both possibilities.\n\nSo, the garden can be extended by either 15 meters in length or 10 meters in width to achieve the desired 50% increase in area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to choose the direction that requires less extension, which would be extending the width by 10 meters.\n\nBut again, that's assuming minimizing the extension is desirable, which may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe extending the length is more practical, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer should include both options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as extending the length, given it's mentioned first.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps we should consider both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find a single value that works for both directions, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we extend the garden in both directions by the same amount, but the problem specifies only one direction.\n\nWait, no, it says only one direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the perimeter or other factors, but that's not necessary for area calculation.\n\nI think the initial approach is correct.\n\nCalculate the extension for each direction and present the results accordingly.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- If extending the length, extend by 15 meters.\n\n- If extending the width, extend by 10 meters.\n\nTherefore, the garden should be extended by either 15 meters in length or 10 meters in width to achieve a 50% increase in area.\n\nBut the problem says \"extend it in only one direction,\" which might imply choosing one option.\n\nHowever, since it doesn't specify which direction, perhaps stating both options is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to choose the direction that requires less extension, to save on, say, landscaping costs, but that's assuming too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the extension in a specific direction, but since it's not specified, perhaps it's to choose one and calculate accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to extend the width by 10 meters.\n\nBut to be comprehensive, perhaps we should present both options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the ratio of the sides after extension, but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"extending it in only one direction,\" which likely means either extending the length or the width, but not both.\n\nWe've already calculated both scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to express the extension in terms of the original dimensions.\n\nWait, but that seems unnecessary when we've already calculated specific values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that directly gives the extension based on the percentage increase.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nIf we want to increase the area by 50%, that means the new area is 150% of the original area.\n\nSo, if we keep one dimension constant and change the other, the ratio of the new dimension to the original dimension should be equal to the ratio of the new area to the original area.\n\nIn other words, if a is the constant dimension and b is the changing dimension, then:\n\nb_new = (area_new / a)\n\nSince area_new = 1.5 * area_original\n\nTherefore, b_new = (1.5 * area_original) / a\n\nAnd the extension x = b_new - b_original\n\nWhich is what we've already used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to think about it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to extend the width by 10 meters.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps we should consider the implications of each choice.\n\nFor example, extending the length by 15 meters would make the new dimensions 45 meters in length and 20 meters in width.\n\nExtending the width by 10 meters would make the new dimensions 30 meters in length and 30 meters in width, which would make the garden a square.\n\nPerhaps the square shape is more desirable, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the available space allows for only certain extensions.\n\nBut since that's not specified, perhaps it's irrelevant.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer should be to extend the width by 10 meters, as it requires less extension.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost of extension is proportional to the extension length, in which case extending the width is more economical.\n\nBut again, that's assuming cost is a factor, which may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to choose the direction that maintains the aspect ratio, but increasing the area by extending only one side will inevitably change the aspect ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that extending in one direction affects the perimeter or other factors, but the problem is solely focused on area.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nCalculate the extension for each direction and provide the corresponding extension amount.\n\nTherefore, the garden should be extended by 15 meters in length or by 10 meters in width to achieve a 50% increase in area.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify which direction to choose, perhaps presenting both options is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to choose one and state it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to extend the width by 10 meters.\n\nBut to ensure completeness, perhaps I should confirm if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to extend the garden in one direction, but allowing for extension in both length and width proportionally.\n\nWait, no, it says \"only one direction.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the garden is extended in one direction, meaning in one linear dimension.\n\nWait, but that's similar to extending either length or width.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps interpreting \"one direction\" as extending the garden in one particular side, but that would be more complex, involving adding a strip to one side.\n\nBut I think the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nSo, to conclude, the garden should be extended by either 15 meters in length or 10 meters in width to achieve a 50% increase in area.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ meters (widthwise)} \\text{ or } 15 \\text{ meters (lengthwise)}} \\]"
