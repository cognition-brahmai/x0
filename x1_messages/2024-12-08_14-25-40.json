        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a group of 8 friends who went to an amusement park. They could either buy individual ride tickets for $3 each or all-day passes for $20 each. Together, they spent a total of $100 on tickets. We need to find out how many of them bought all-day passes.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of friends who bought all-day passes.\n\n- Therefore, the number of friends who bought individual ride tickets would be \\( 8 - x \\), since there are 8 friends in total.\n\nNext, we need to set up an equation based on the total amount spent. Each all-day pass costs $20, so the total cost for the all-day passes is \\( 20x \\). Each individual ride ticket costs $3, so the total cost for the individual tickets is \\( 3(8 - x) \\). The sum of these amounts equals the total amount spent, which is $100. So, our equation is:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3(8 - x) = 100 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n\\[ 20x + 24 - 3x = 100 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 17x + 24 = 100 \\]\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 17x = 76 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 17:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{76}{17} \\]\n\nHmm, 76 divided by 17. Let's see:\n\n17 times 4 is 68.\n\n68 plus 8 is 76.\n\nSo, \\( x = 4 + \\frac{8}{17} \\), but that doesn't make sense because the number of people should be a whole number.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.\n\nWe have 8 friends in total.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of all-day pass buyers.\n\nThen, \\( 8 - x \\) is the number of individual ticket buyers.\n\nEach all-day pass is $20, so total cost for all-day passes is \\( 20x \\).\n\nEach individual ticket is $3, so total cost for individual tickets is \\( 3(8 - x) \\).\n\nTotal spent is $100, so:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3(8 - x) = 100 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nLet me solve it again.\n\n\\[ 20x + 24 - 3x = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 17x + 24 = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 17x = 76 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{76}{17} \\]\n\nBut \\( \\frac{76}{17} \\) is approximately 4.47, which isn't a whole number. But the number of people should be a whole number. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup or in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that some friends might have bought multiple individual tickets. But the problem says they could buy either individual ride tickets or an all-day pass, implying that each friend buys only one type of ticket.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for friends to buy multiple individual tickets. The problem says \"buy either individual ride tickets or an all-day pass.\" So, a friend could buy multiple individual tickets but only one all-day pass, since an all-day pass is a single item.\n\nLet me reconsider.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each friend buys only one type of ticket, but multiple individual tickets if they choose that option. But that would complicate things, as we don't know how many individual tickets each friend bought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intends that each friend buys only one ticket, either one individual ride ticket or one all-day pass.\n\nIf that's the case, then the equation I set up initially should be correct, leading to \\( x = \\frac{76}{17} \\), which is not a whole number. But that's impossible since the number of people must be whole numbers.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption that each friend buys only one ticket might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps friends can buy multiple individual ride tickets but only one all-day pass.\n\nIn that case, let\u2019s define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of friends who bought the all-day pass (each buys one all-day pass).\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the total number of individual ride tickets bought by the remaining friends.\n\nThen, the total cost equation would be:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3y = 100 \\]\n\nAnd the total number of friends is 8, so:\n\n\\[ x + \\text{(number of friends who bought individual tickets)} = 8 \\]\n\nBut since one friend can buy multiple individual tickets, the number of friends who bought individual tickets is less than or equal to 8 - x.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem assumes that each friend buys only one ticket, either one individual ride ticket or one all-day pass.\n\nIf that's the case, then with 8 friends and total spending of $100, the equation is:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3(8 - x) = 100 \\]\n\nWhich gives \\( x = \\frac{76}{17} \\), which is not a whole number.\n\nBut since the number of people must be whole numbers, perhaps there is no solution under this assumption, meaning the assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows friends to buy multiple individual ride tickets.\n\nIn that case, we need to find non-negative integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that:\n\n\\[ x + y \\leq 8 \\] (since there are 8 friends)\n\n\\[ 20x + 3y = 100 \\]\n\nBut this seems too broad. Let\u2019s try to find integer solutions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy both equations.\n\nFirst, from the total cost equation:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3y = 100 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{100 - 20x}{3} \\]\n\nFor \\( y \\) to be an integer, \\( 100 - 20x \\) must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet\u2019s find values of \\( x \\) that make \\( 100 - 20x \\) divisible by 3.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 0 = 100 \\]\n\n100 divided by 3 is 33.333\u2026, not an integer.\n\n\\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \\]\n\n80 divided by 3 is 26.666\u2026, not an integer.\n\n\\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \\]\n\n60 divided by 3 is 20, which is an integer.\n\nSo, \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 20 \\)\n\nCheck if \\( x + y \\leq 8 \\):\n\n2 + 20 = 22, which is greater than 8. But this would mean that there are more individual tickets bought than there are friends, which is possible if friends buy multiple tickets. However, it contradicts the total number of friends being 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that each friend can buy multiple individual tickets.\n\nLet\u2019s think differently.\n\nSuppose \\( x \\) friends buy all-day passes, and the remaining \\( 8 - x \\) friends buy individual ride tickets.\n\nIf each of the \\( 8 - x \\) friends buys \\( t \\) individual ride tickets, then the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3t(8 - x) = 100 \\]\n\nBut this introduces another variable, \\( t \\), which is the number of tickets per friend.\n\nThis makes the problem underdetermined, as there are now two variables and one equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that each friend buys only one ticket, either one individual ride ticket or one all-day pass.\n\nIn that case, the initial equation is correct:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3(8 - x) = 100 \\]\n\nBut as we saw, this gives \\( x = \\frac{76}{17} \\), which is not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that the problem might have a mistake, or perhaps the assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the all-day pass allows unlimited rides, so those who buy all-day passes don't buy individual tickets.\n\nIn that case, the equation is correct as initially set up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that some friends bought multiple all-day passes, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the total amount spent is not $100, or the number of friends is not 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost of the all-day pass is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the cost of the all-day pass is not $20, but something else.\n\nWait, no, the problem states $20 for the all-day pass and $3 for individual ride tickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of friends is not 8.\n\nWait, no, the problem states 8 friends.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total amount spent is not $100.\n\nWait, no, the problem says $100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows friends to share all-day passes, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends that only some friends bought all-day passes, and the rest bought individual ride tickets, with some friends possibly buying multiple individual ride tickets.\n\nIn that case, we have:\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of friends who bought all-day passes.\n\nLet \\( y \\) be the total number of individual ride tickets bought by all friends.\n\nThen, the total cost is:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3y = 100 \\]\n\nAlso, since there are 8 friends, and each friend can buy either an all-day pass or one or more individual ride tickets, we have:\n\n\\[ x + \\text{(number of friends who bought individual ride tickets)} = 8 \\]\n\nBut since one friend can buy multiple individual ride tickets, the number of friends who bought individual ride tickets is less than or equal to \\( 8 - x \\).\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each friend buys only one ticket, either one individual ride ticket or one all-day pass.\n\nIn that case, as previously determined, \\( x = \\frac{76}{17} \\), which is not an integer, suggesting that such an assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no solution with the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of all-day passes is less than or equal to 8, and find a value of \\( x \\) that makes \\( y \\) an integer and \\( x + y \\leq 8 \\).\n\nFrom earlier, when \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\), but \\( x + y = 22 \\), which is greater than 8.\n\nWhen \\( x = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ 20*5 + 3y = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 100 + 3y = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 3y = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 0 \\]\n\nAnd \\( x + y = 5 + 0 = 5 \\), which is less than or equal to 8.\n\nSo, \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y = 0 \\) is a possible solution.\n\nSimilarly, when \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 20 \\), but \\( x + y = 22 \\), which is greater than 8, so that's invalid.\n\nWhen \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), \\( x + y = 5 \\), which is less than or equal to 8.\n\nThis would mean that 5 friends bought all-day passes, and the remaining 3 friends bought no tickets at all, which might not make sense in the context of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows some friends to not buy any tickets, which is possible.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as the problem says they \"spent a total of $100 on tickets,\" implying that all friends bought some type of ticket.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all friends bought at least one ticket, but possibly more.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the maximum and minimum possible spending.\n\nIf all 8 friends bought all-day passes, the total cost would be \\( 8 * 20 = 160 \\) dollars, which is more than $100.\n\nIf all 8 friends bought individual ride tickets, the total cost would be \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\) dollars, which is less than $100.\n\nSo, the total spending of $100 is somewhere between these two extremes.\n\nLet\u2019s see how much each friend contributes on average:\n\n\\[ \\frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \\] dollars per friend.\n\nNow, an all-day pass is $20, which is more than $12.5, and an individual ride ticket is $3, which is less than $12.5.\n\nSo, some friends bought all-day passes, and some bought individual ride tickets.\n\nBut as previously determined, if each friend buys only one ticket, the equation \\( 20x + 3(8 - x) = 100 \\) leads to a non-integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, if friends can buy multiple individual ride tickets, then we have the equation \\( 20x + 3y = 100 \\), with \\( x + z \\leq 8 \\), where \\( z \\) is the number of friends who bought individual ride tickets, and \\( y \\) is the total number of individual ride tickets bought.\n\nThis seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each friend buys only one ticket, and the total spending is $100, but maybe the number of friends is different.\n\nWait, no, the problem clearly states 8 friends.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself, and the numbers don't align properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some friends bought all-day passes and some bought multiple individual ride tickets.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find integer solutions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the equation \\( 20x + 3y = 100 \\), with \\( x + y \\leq 8 \\).\n\nWe can try different values of \\( x \\):\n\n- \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 3y = 100 \\) \u2192 \\( y = 100 / 3 \\approx 33.333 \\), not an integer.\n\n- \\( x = 1 \\): \\( 20 + 3y = 100 \\) \u2192 \\( 3y = 80 \\) \u2192 \\( y = 80 / 3 \\approx 26.666 \\), not an integer.\n\n- \\( x = 2 \\): \\( 40 + 3y = 100 \\) \u2192 \\( 3y = 60 \\) \u2192 \\( y = 20 \\). But \\( x + y = 22 \\), which is greater than 8.\n\n- \\( x = 3 \\): \\( 60 + 3y = 100 \\) \u2192 \\( 3y = 40 \\) \u2192 \\( y = 40 / 3 \\approx 13.333 \\), not an integer.\n\n- \\( x = 4 \\): \\( 80 + 3y = 100 \\) \u2192 \\( 3y = 20 \\) \u2192 \\( y = 20 / 3 \\approx 6.666 \\), not an integer.\n\n- \\( x = 5 \\): \\( 100 + 3y = 100 \\) \u2192 \\( 3y = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( y = 0 \\). Here, \\( x + y = 5 + 0 = 5 \\), which is less than or equal to 8.\n\nSo, \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y = 0 \\) is a possible solution.\n\nThis would mean that 5 friends bought all-day passes, and the remaining 3 friends bought no tickets, which might not make sense in the context of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows some friends to not buy any tickets.\n\nBut the problem says they \"spent a total of $100 on tickets,\" which suggests that all friends contributed to the spending, possibly by buying tickets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some friends contributed money without buying tickets, but that's not clear.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the problem has no solution with the given numbers, or perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved differently.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each friend buys only one ticket, either one all-day pass or one individual ride ticket.\n\nThen, the equation is:\n\n\\[ 20x + 3(8 - x) = 100 \\]\n\nSolving:\n\n\\[ 20x + 24 - 3x = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 17x + 24 = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 17x = 76 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{76}{17} \\approx 4.47 \\]\n\nNot an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows friends to buy fractional tickets, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the total amount spent is not $100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of friends is not 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the costs are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to have a different setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some friends bought all-day passes and others bought multiple individual ride tickets.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a combination where the total cost is $100 and the number of friends is 8.\n\nSuppose 4 friends bought all-day passes:\n\n\\[ 4 * 20 = 80 \\] dollars.\n\nThen, the remaining amount is \\( 100 - 80 = 20 \\) dollars, which could be spent on individual ride tickets.\n\nEach individual ride ticket is $3, so \\( 20 / 3 \\approx 6.666 \\) tickets, which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, suppose 3 friends bought all-day passes:\n\n\\[ 3 * 20 = 60 \\] dollars.\n\nRemaining amount: \\( 100 - 60 = 40 \\) dollars.\n\nNumber of individual ride tickets: \\( 40 / 3 \\approx 13.333 \\), not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, suppose 2 friends bought all-day passes:\n\n\\[ 2 * 20 = 40 \\] dollars.\n\nRemaining amount: \\( 100 - 40 = 60 \\) dollars.\n\nNumber of individual ride tickets: \\( 60 / 3 = 20 \\) tickets.\n\nBut if only 2 friends bought all-day passes, the remaining 6 friends would have to buy 20 individual ride tickets.\n\nThat would mean, on average, each of the 6 friends bought \\( 20 / 6 \\approx 3.333 \\) tickets each, which is possible, but the problem might expect whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some friends bought more tickets than others.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so maybe this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, suppose 5 friends bought all-day passes:\n\n\\[ 5 * 20 = 100 \\] dollars.\n\nThen, no money left for individual ride tickets.\n\nBut there are 8 friends in total, so 3 friends didn't buy any tickets, which might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for that.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the solution is that 5 friends bought all-day passes, and the remaining 3 friends didn't buy any tickets.\n\nBut the problem says they \"spent a total of $100 on tickets,\" which might imply that all friends contributed to the spending, but it's not explicitly stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for some friends to not buy any tickets.\n\nGiven that, \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y = 0 \\) is a possible solution, meaning 5 friends bought all-day passes, and the remaining 3 friends bought no tickets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that all friends bought at least one ticket, which would make the only possible solution \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 20 \\), but that would require 20 individual ride tickets among 6 friends, which is possible but perhaps not the intended scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no solution with the given numbers, or there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that 5 friends bought all-day passes, and the remaining 3 friends bought no tickets.\n\nBut that seems unsatisfactory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have a different setup, and I need to consider that friends can buy fractional all-day passes, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and the total amount spent is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of friends is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the costs are different.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is unsolvable with the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some friends bought multiple all-day passes, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using a different method.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the solution is that 5 friends bought all-day passes, and the remaining 3 friends bought no tickets.\n\nSo, the number of friends who bought all-day passes is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
