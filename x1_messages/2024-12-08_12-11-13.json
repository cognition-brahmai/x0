        "content": "So, the train usually goes at 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours to reach its destination. If it went twice as fast, meaning 120 miles per hour, how long would it take to reach the same destination?\n\nFirst, I need to find out how far the destination is. Since speed is distance over time, distance should be speed multiplied by time. So, 60 miles per hour times 2 hours equals 120 miles. That's the distance to the destination.\n\nNow, if the train travels twice as fast, that's 120 miles per hour. I need to find out how long it takes to cover 120 miles at 120 miles per hour. Again, time is distance divided by speed. So, 120 miles divided by 120 miles per hour should give me the time.\n\nLet me do the math: 120 divided by 120 is 1. So, it would take 1 hour to reach the destination if the train traveled at 120 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? If the train is going twice as fast, it should take half the time, right? Because speed and time are inversely proportional when distance is constant.\n\nLet me check: original time is 2 hours, half of that is 1 hour. Yep, that matches what I calculated.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1 hour.\n\nBut let me think about this differently. If the train is going twice as fast, it covers more distance in the same amount of time. So, in 1 hour at 120 mph, it would cover 120 miles. That matches the distance to the destination, so it makes sense that it would take 1 hour.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula time = distance / speed. We have distance (120 miles) and the new speed (120 mph), so time is 120 / 120 = 1 hour.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this to confirm?\n\nSuppose I consider the ratio of speeds. Original speed is 60 mph, new speed is 120 mph, so the speed ratio is 2:1. Since time is inversely proportional to speed for a given distance, the time should be halved.\n\nOriginal time is 2 hours, so new time should be 1 hour. That matches my previous calculations.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
