        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car rental company charges $50 per day to rent a car, and on top of that, there's an additional charge of $0.25 for every mile you drive. You want to know the total cost if you rent the car for 3 days and drive it for 200 miles.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the cost of renting the car for 3 days. Since it's $50 per day, I can multiply 50 by 3:\n\n50 * 3 = 150\n\nSo, the rental cost for 3 days is $150.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 200 miles. The charge is $0.25 per mile, so I can multiply 0.25 by 200:\n\n0.25 * 200 = 50\n\nSo, the mileage cost is $50.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the rental cost and the mileage cost together:\n\n150 + 50 = 200\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for 3 days and drive it for 200 miles would be $200.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nRental cost: $50 per day * 3 days = $150\n\nMileage cost: $0.25 per mile * 200 miles = $50\n\nTotal cost: $150 + $50 = $200\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in a different way. Maybe there's a formula or a different approach that could confirm this.\n\nLet me see: total cost = (daily rental rate * number of days) + (mileage rate * number of miles)\n\nPlugging in the numbers: total cost = (50 * 3) + (0.25 * 200) = 150 + 50 = 200\n\nSame result.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's something else I should consider. Is there any additional fee or tax that might be applied? The problem doesn't mention any extra charges, so I think it's safe to assume that the total cost is just the sum of the rental and mileage costs.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct units. The rental rate is per day and the mileage rate is per mile, and the quantities given are 3 days and 200 miles, so everything matches up correctly.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the cost per mile and per day separately and then combine them, but that seems unnecessarily complicated since the problem provides straightforward rates.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this as an equation, it would be:\n\nTotal cost = (rental rate per day * number of days) + (mileage rate per mile * number of miles)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nI could also consider the cost per day including mileage, but since the mileage cost depends on the number of miles driven, it's better to keep them separate as given in the problem.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total cost for renting the car for 3 days and driving it for 200 miles is $200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
