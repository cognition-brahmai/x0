        "content": "So there are 25 red balls and 75 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 100 balls. If I pick one ball at random, the probability that it's red should be the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, right? So that would be 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4 or 25%. Make sense?\n\nNow, if I put that ball back into the bag and mix them up again, the total number of balls is still 100, with 25 red balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball again should be the same as the first time, which is still 25/100 or 25%. Because I'm replacing the ball, the conditions don't change between the two picks.\n\nBut wait, what if I didn't put the ball back? What would happen then? Let's say I pick one red ball and don't replace it. Then, for the second pick, there would be only 24 red balls and 75 blue balls left, totaling 99 balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball the second time would be 24/99, which is about 24.24%. That's slightly less than the first pick because I didn't replace the ball.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I am putting the ball back, the probability remains the same for each pick. So, for two picks with replacement, the probability of getting red both times would be 25% for each pick.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for the probability of both events happening together: picking a red ball twice in a row with replacement. If that's the case, then I need to calculate the combined probability of two independent events both occurring.\n\nSince the picks are independent (because of replacement), the combined probability would be the product of the individual probabilities. So, 25% times 25% is 6.25%. So, there's a 6.25% chance that both balls picked are red.\n\nBut looking back, the question seems to be asking for two separate probabilities: first, the probability of picking a red ball once, and second, if I pick again with replacement, what's the probability that the second ball is also red.\n\nSo, the first probability is 25/100 = 25%, and the second probability is also 25/100 = 25%, since the conditions are the same for both picks.\n\nMaybe I should confirm this. Let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst pick:\n\nTotal balls: 100 (25 red + 75 blue)\n\nProbability of picking red: 25/100 = 25%\n\nSecond pick (with replacement):\n\nI put the first ball back, so total balls are still 100 (25 red + 75 blue)\n\nProbability of picking red again: again 25/100 = 25%\n\nSo, each pick independently has a 25% chance of being red.\n\nBut if I want to know the probability that both picks are red, then I multiply the probabilities: 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nWait, but the question seems to be asking for the probability of the first pick being red, and then separately, the probability of the second pick being red after replacing the first ball.\n\nSo, it's not necessarily asking for both events to happen together, but rather two separate probabilities.\n\nSo, the answer would be:\n\nProbability of first pick being red: 25%\n\nProbability of second pick being red (with replacement): 25%\n\nUnless the question is asking for the probability of both events happening together, in which case it would be 6.25%.\n\nI think I need to read the question again to make sure.\n\n\" If you randomly pick one ball from the bag, what is the probability that it is red? If you then put the ball back into the bag and mix the balls again, what is the probability that the second ball you pick is also red?\"\n\nSo, it's asking for two separate probabilities: the first pick being red, and then the second pick being red after replacement.\n\nSo, each probability is 25%.\n\nBut maybe it's also implying that I should consider both events happening together, but technically, they are two separate events.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a setup for understanding independent events in probability.\n\nIn any case, the probability for each pick being red, with replacement, is 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\%} \\]"
