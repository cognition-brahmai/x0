        "content": "Sure, I'll help you with that. First, we need to create a new table named 'Employees' with the specified fields: ID (integer), Name (varchar), Age (integer), and Salary (decimal). Then, we'll insert five records into this table and finally, write a query to retrieve employees who earn more than $5000.\n\nLet's start by creating the table. In SQL, the CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Employees (\n    ID INT,\n    Name VARCHAR(100),\n    Age INT,\n    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n);\n```\n\nIn this statement:\n\n- `ID INT` defines an integer field for the employee's ID.\n\n- `Name VARCHAR(100)` creates a variable character field for the employee's name, with a maximum length of 100 characters.\n\n- `Age INT` defines an integer field for the employee's age.\n\n- `Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)` creates a decimal field for the employee's salary, with a total of 10 digits and 2 digits after the decimal point.\n\nNext, we need to insert five records into this table. The INSERT INTO statement is used for this purpose. Here's an example of how to insert five employees:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Age, Salary) VALUES\n(1, 'John Doe', 30, 5500.00),\n(2, 'Jane Smith', 25, 6000.00),\n(3, 'Alice Johnson', 35, 4500.00),\n(4, 'Bob Brown', 40, 7000.00),\n(5, 'Charlie Davis', 28, 5000.00);\n```\n\nIn this statement:\n\n- We specify the table name (`Employees`) and the columns we're inserting data into (`ID`, `Name`, `Age`, `Salary`).\n\n- Then, we provide the values for each record. Each set of values corresponds to one employee.\n\nFinally, we need to retrieve employees who earn more than $5000. We can use the SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter the records based on the Salary field. Here's the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 5000.00;\n```\n\nThis query will select all columns (`*`) from the `Employees` table where the `Salary` is greater than $5000.\n\nPutting it all together, here are the three SQL statements:\n\n1. Create the table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Employees (\n    ID INT,\n    Name VARCHAR(100),\n    Age INT,\n    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n);\n```\n\n2. Insert five records:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Age, Salary) VALUES\n(1, 'John Doe', 30, 5500.00),\n(2, 'Jane Smith', 25, 6000.00),\n(3, 'Alice Johnson', 35, 4500.00),\n(4, 'Bob Brown', 40, 7000.00),\n(5, 'Charlie Davis', 28, 5000.00);\n```\n\n3. Retrieve employees earning more than $5000:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 5000.00;\n```\n\nThese statements should be executed in the order provided to ensure that the table exists and is populated before attempting to retrieve data from it.\n\nI hope this helps!
