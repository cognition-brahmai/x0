The expression is:\n\n((3^2 - 4) * 6) / 2 + 8\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting inside the parentheses:\n\n3^2 - 4\n\n3^2 is 9, because 3 squared is 9.\n\nThen, 9 - 4 is 5.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n(5 * 6) / 2 + 8\n\nNext, multiplication and division from left to right.\n\n5 * 6 is 30.\n\nThen, 30 / 2 is 15.\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n15 + 8\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n15 + 8 equals 23.\n\nSo, the final answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]"
