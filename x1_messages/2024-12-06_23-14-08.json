        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about cars in a parking lot. It says there are 4 times as many blue cars as green cars, and twice as many red cars as blue cars. And there are 24 green cars in total. I need to find out how many cars there are in the parking lot altogether.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably figure out how many blue cars there are. Since there are 4 times as many blue cars as green cars, and there are 24 green cars, I can calculate the number of blue cars by multiplying 24 by 4. Let me do that:\n\nBlue cars = 4 \u00d7 green cars = 4 \u00d7 24 = 96\n\nSo, there are 96 blue cars.\n\nNext, it says there are twice as many red cars as blue cars. So, to find the number of red cars, I need to multiply the number of blue cars by 2.\n\nRed cars = 2 \u00d7 blue cars = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n\nAlright, so there are 192 red cars.\n\nNow, to find the total number of cars in the parking lot, I need to add up all the green, blue, and red cars.\n\nTotal cars = green cars + blue cars + red cars = 24 + 96 + 192\n\nLet me add those up:\n\n24 + 96 = 120\n\n120 + 192 = 312\n\nSo, there are 312 cars in the parking lot in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of variables. Let\u2019s assign a variable to the number of green cars. Let\u2019s say g = 24.\n\nThen, blue cars b = 4 \u00d7 g = 4 \u00d7 24 = 96\n\nAnd red cars r = 2 \u00d7 b = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n\nTotal cars = g + b + r = 24 + 96 + 192 = 312\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could express everything in terms of green cars. Since blue cars are 4 times green cars and red cars are twice blue cars, which is 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 times green cars.\n\nSo, total cars = g + 4g + 8g = 13g\n\nGiven that g = 24, total cars = 13 \u00d7 24 = 312\n\nAgain, that gives me the same answer, 312.\n\nAlright, I think that's correct. So, the parking lot has 312 cars in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{312} \\]"
