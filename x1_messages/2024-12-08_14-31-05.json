        "content": "The disease you're referring to is scurvy. It's caused by a deficiency in vitamin C, which is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein that plays a crucial role in the body's connective tissues. Scurvy was indeed a common ailment among sailors during long voyages before the importance of vitamin C was understood and preventive measures were implemented.\n\nSymptoms of scurvy include fatigue, weakness, swollen and bleeding gums, joint pain, and in severe cases, skin hemorrhages and even death. The disease was particularly prevalent among sailors because their diets on long voyages often lacked fresh fruits and vegetables, which are rich sources of vitamin C.\n\nThe connection between scurvy and the lack of fresh produce in the diet was first noted in the 18th century. Scottish surgeon James Lind conducted some of the earliest clinical trials in 1747, demonstrating that citrus fruits could prevent and cure scurvy. Based on this knowledge, the British Royal Navy began issuing lime juice to sailors, which led to a significant reduction in scurvy cases. This practice is believed to be the origin of the term \"limey,\" which was used to refer to British sailors.\n\nToday, scurvy is rare in developed countries due to the availability of fresh foods and dietary supplements, but it can still occur in people with poor diets, especially those who rely heavily on processed foods that are low in vitamin C. Prevention is straightforward: ensuring an adequate intake of vitamin C through a balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables such as oranges, strawberries, bell peppers, and broccoli.\n\nIn summary, scurvy is a disease resulting from vitamin C deficiency, historically affecting sailors on long voyages due to the absence of fresh produce in their diets. Its prevention and treatment involve consuming sufficient amounts of vitamin C through diet or supplements."
