        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in the room. 70% are wearing glasses, so that's 70 people. 80% are wearing hats, which is 80 people. And 60% are wearing both glasses and hats, that's 60 people.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many people are wearing neither glasses nor hats. To do that, I should probably first find out how many people are wearing either glasses or hats or both.\n\nI recall there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle. It says that to find the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats, I should add the number wearing glasses to the number wearing hats and then subtract the number wearing both, so I don't double-count those wearing both.\n\nSo, total wearing glasses or hats or both = (number wearing glasses) + (number wearing hats) - (number wearing both).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 70 + 80 - 60 = 90 people.\n\nSo, 90 people are wearing either glasses or hats or both. Therefore, the number of people wearing neither would be the total number of people minus those wearing something.\n\nTotal people = 100.\n\nPeople wearing neither = 100 - 90 = 10 people.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 60 people are wearing both, and 70 are wearing glasses, that means 70 - 60 = 10 people are wearing only glasses.\n\nSimilarly, 80 are wearing hats, so 80 - 60 = 20 people are wearing only hats.\n\nAnd 60 are wearing both.\n\nSo, total wearing something is 10 (only glasses) + 20 (only hats) + 60 (both) = 90 people.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the number of people wearing neither is 100 - 90 = 10.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
