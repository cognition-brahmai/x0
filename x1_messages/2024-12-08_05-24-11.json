        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 mph, and the distance is 180 miles. Then it comes back to Town A at half that speed, which would be 30 mph. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I should remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I need to find the total distance and the total time taken for the trip.\n\nThe distance from A to B is 180 miles, and then back from B to A is another 180 miles, so total distance is 360 miles.\n\nNow, time taken from A to B at 60 mph. Time is distance over speed, so 180 miles divided by 60 mph is 3 hours.\n\nThen, from B to A at 30 mph. Again, time is distance over speed, so 180 miles divided by 30 mph is 6 hours.\n\nTotal time is 3 hours plus 6 hours, which is 9 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance divided by total time: 360 miles divided by 9 hours is 40 mph.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that when speeds are different for the same distance, there's a formula for average speed, which is harmonic mean or something like that. Maybe I should check if my answer is correct.\n\nLet me look it up. Oh, I remember now. The formula for average speed when the distance is the same but speeds are different is: average speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nIn this case, speed1 is 60 mph and speed2 is 30 mph.\n\nSo, average speed = (2 * 60 * 30) / (60 + 30) = (2 * 1800) / 90 = 3600 / 90 = 40 mph.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is 40 mph.\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Let me think again. The train goes to B at 60 mph and returns at 30 mph. So, it takes more time to come back, which means the average speed should be closer to the slower speed.\n\nBut according to the calculations, it's 40 mph, which is between 30 and 60. Does that make sense?\n\nLet me check with another approach. If the train goes to B at 60 mph in 3 hours and comes back in 6 hours, total time is 9 hours for 360 miles, which again gives 40 mph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of time spent at each speed.\n\nBut no, I think the first method is correct. The average speed is indeed 40 mph.\n\nMaybe I can consider another example to verify. Suppose the distance is 60 miles, speed to B is 60 mph, time is 1 hour. Speed back is 30 mph, time is 2 hours. Total distance 120 miles, total time 3 hours, average speed 40 mph. Same as before.\n\nSo, yes, I think 40 mph is the correct average speed for the entire trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
