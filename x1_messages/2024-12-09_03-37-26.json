        "content": "To determine the break-even point for the company, we need to find out how many units must be sold so that the total revenue equals the total cost. The break-even point is where there is no profit or loss.\n\nFirst, let's define the components involved:\n\n1. **Fixed Costs (FC):** These are costs that do not change with the level of production or sales. In this case, the monthly fixed cost for rent and utilities is $5,000.\n\n2. **Variable Costs (VC):** These are costs that vary directly with the level of production. Here, the variable cost per unit is $10.\n\n3. **Selling Price per Unit (SP):** This is the price at which each unit is sold. In this scenario, it's $25 per unit.\n\nThe break-even point in units (BEU) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nBEU = \\frac{FC}{SP - VC}\n\\]\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n\n\\[\nBEU = \\frac{5000}{25 - 10} = \\frac{5000}{15} \\approx 333.33\n\\]\n\nSince the company cannot sell a fraction of a unit, they need to sell at least 334 units to cover all their costs and break even.\n\nTo verify this, let's calculate the total revenue and total cost at 334 units:\n\n- **Total Revenue (TR):** TR = BEU * SP = 334 * 25 = $8,350\n\n- **Total Cost (TC):** TC = FC + (BEU * VC) = 5000 + (334 * 10) = 5000 + 3,340 = $8,340\n\nAt 334 units, the revenue ($8,350) is slightly higher than the cost ($8,340), resulting in a very small profit. If they sell only 333 units:\n\n- TR = 333 * 25 = $8,325\n\n- TC = 5000 + (333 * 10) = 5000 + 3,330 = $8,330\n\nHere, the revenue ($8,325) is less than the cost ($8,330), resulting in a small loss. Therefore, selling 334 units is indeed the break-even point.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the difference between the selling price and the variable cost per unit (SP - VC = $15) is known as the contribution margin per unit. This amount contributes to covering the fixed costs. Hence, dividing the fixed costs by the contribution margin per unit gives the break-even point in units.\n\nIn summary, the company must sell at least 334 units each month to break even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{334} \\]"
