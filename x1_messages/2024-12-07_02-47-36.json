        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle with an area of 84 square units, and the length is 3 times the width. We need to find both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, I recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if we let the width be \\( w \\) units, then the length must be \\( 3w \\) units because it's 3 times the width.\n\nNow, plugging these into the area formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 3w \\times w = 3w^2\n\\]\n\nWe know the area is 84 square units, so:\n\n\\[\n3w^2 = 84\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( w \\), I need to solve this equation. First, I'll divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nw^2 = \\frac{84}{3} = 28\n\\]\n\nNext, take the square root of both sides to solve for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\nw = \\sqrt{28}\n\\]\n\nHmm, 28 can be simplified since it's 4 times 7:\n\n\\[\nw = \\sqrt{4 \\times 7} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{7} = 2\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nSo, the width is \\( 2\\sqrt{7} \\) units. Now, to find the length, which is 3 times the width:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = 3 \\times 2\\sqrt{7} = 6\\sqrt{7} \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but I feel like there might be a simpler way to express this, or maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting again: area = length \u00d7 width, and length = 3 \u00d7 width.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n84 = 3w \\times w = 3w^2\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nw^2 = \\frac{84}{3} = 28\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = 3 \\times 2\\sqrt{7} = 6\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nThis seems consistent. But maybe I can approximate this to get a better sense of the numbers. Let's see, \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) is approximately 2.6458.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nw \\approx 2 \\times 2.6458 \\approx 5.2916 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} \\approx 6 \\times 2.6458 \\approx 15.8748 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nBut since the problem gives measurements in terms of square units without specifying, and since we have an exact value involving a square root, perhaps leaving it in terms of \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rationalize it differently. Let me consider if 28 is a perfect square. No, 28 is not a perfect square; its square root is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the width is \\( w \\) and length is \\( 3w \\). Maybe there's another relationship between length and width that I'm missing.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the length of the rectangle is 3 times its width.\" So, yes, length = 3 \u00d7 width seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, like using the perimeter or something else, but the problem only mentions the area and the relationship between length and width.\n\nLet me try plugging in the values to check if they make sense.\n\nIf width \\( w = 2\\sqrt{7} \\), and length \\( l = 6\\sqrt{7} \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = l \\times w = 6\\sqrt{7} \\times 2\\sqrt{7} = 12 \\times 7 = 84\n\\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the simplification of \\( \\sqrt{28} \\). Let's see:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{28} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 7} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{7} = 2\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in decimal form. If that's the case, then:\n\n\\[\nw \\approx 5.2915 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nl \\approx 15.8745 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nBut since the problem deals with square roots, it's likely that the expected answer is in terms of \\( \\sqrt{7} \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express both dimensions in terms of \\( \\sqrt{7} \\):\n\nWidth: \\( 2\\sqrt{7} \\) units\n\nLength: \\( 6\\sqrt{7} \\) units\n\nAlternatively, factor out \\( \\sqrt{7} \\):\n\nLet \\( k = \\sqrt{7} \\), then:\n\nWidth: \\( 2k \\) units\n\nLength: \\( 6k \\) units\n\nBut that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me consider if \"length\" is always the longer side. In some contexts, width can be longer than length. However, in standard conventions, length is usually the longer side, so assuming length = 3 \u00d7 width seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to test something else, but I think I've arrived at the correct dimensions.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle are:\n\nWidth: \\( 2\\sqrt{7} \\) units\n\nLength: \\( 6\\sqrt{7} \\) units\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the rectangle are \\boxed{2\\sqrt{7} \\text{ units} \\text{ (width)} \\text{ and } 6\\sqrt{7} \\text{ units} \\text{ (length)}}."
