        "content": "Finding words that contain all vowels is a bit tricky, but I think I've got this. Let's see, words like \"sequoia\" and \"education\" come to mind. Wait, \"sequoia\" has all vowels, and \"education\" almost does, but it's missing the 'u'. Hmm, maybe \"facetious\" is another one. Let me check:\n\n- Sequoia: s-e-q-u-o-i-a, that's a-e-i-o-u.\n\n- Facetious: f-a-c-e-t-i-o-u-s, that's a-e-i-o-u.\n\n- Education: e-d-u-c-a-t-i-o-n, that's a-e-i-o-u, but it has two u's. Wait, does it have all vowels? Let's see: a, e, i, o, u. It has a, e, u, i, o. Yeah, it's got all vowels.\n\nSo, I can use \"sequoia\" and \"education\" in a haiku. Now, a haiku is a Japanese poetic form that typically consists of three phrases with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern. It often focuses on nature or profound insights and includes a kigo, which is a word that suggests a particular season.\n\nLet me think about how to incorporate these words naturally into a haiku. Maybe something about a sequoia tree and education.\n\nHere's a try:\n\nIn sequoia's shade,\n\nEducation whispers soft,\n\nWisdom takes root.\n\nWait, that might work. Let's count the syllables:\n\n- In sequoia's shade, (5 syllables)\n\n- Education whispers soft, (7 syllables)\n\n- Wisdom takes root. (5 syllables)\n\nPerfect. And it incorporates both words with all vowels. The image of learning under a ancient tree seems fitting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nAmidst educative,\n\nSequoia stands tall, a sage,\n\nNature's classroom.\n\nLet's count:\n\n- Amidst educative, (5 syllables)\n\n- Sequoia stands tall, a sage, (7 syllables)\n\n- Nature's classroom. (3 syllables)\n\nOh, that last line is only 3 syllables. That doesn't fit the 5-7-5 pattern. Maybe I need to adjust it.\n\nHow about:\n\nBeneath sequoia's,\n\nEducative boughs, we learn,\n\nNature's wisdom.\n\nSyllable count:\n\n- Beneath sequoia's, (5 syllables)\n\n- Educative boughs, we learn, (7 syllables)\n\n- Nature's wisdom. (3 syllables)\n\nAgain, the last line is short. Maybe I can expand it.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nIn sequoia's embrace,\n\nEducation's gentle touch,\n\nWisdom blooms here.\n\nSyllable count:\n\n- In sequoia's embrace, (5 syllables)\n\n- Education's gentle touch, (7 syllables)\n\n- Wisdom blooms here. (5 syllables)\n\nThat works. I like that one better.\n\nSo, here are two options:\n\n1. In sequoia's shade,\n\nEducation whispers soft,\n\nWisdom takes root.\n\n2. In sequoia's embrace,\n\nEducation's gentle touch,\n\nWisdom blooms here.\n\nI think the second one flows better. What do you think?\n\nAlright, I'll go with the second one.\n\nIn sequoia's embrace,\n\nEducation's gentle touch,\n\nWisdom blooms here.\n\nThat should do it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{In sequoia's embrace,\\\\ Education's gentle touch,\\\\ Wisdom blooms here.}} \\]"
