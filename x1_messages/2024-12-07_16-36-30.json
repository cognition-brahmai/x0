        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a farmer who has 120 acres of land, and he plants both corn and wheat. The problem says he plants three times as many acres of corn as wheat. We need to figure out how many acres of each crop he plants.\n\nFirst, let's define what we don't know. We don't know how many acres of wheat he plants, and we don't know how many acres of corn he plants. But we do know the total land is 120 acres, and the relationship between the acres of corn and wheat.\n\nLet's use some variables to represent the unknowns. Let's say:\n\n- Let W be the number of acres of wheat.\n\n- Since he plants three times as many acres of corn as wheat, the number of acres of corn would be 3W.\n\nNow, the total land is the sum of the acres of wheat and the acres of corn. So, we can write an equation:\n\nW + 3W = 120\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\n4W = 120\n\nNow, to find W, we divide both sides by 4:\n\nW = 120 / 4\n\nW = 30\n\nSo, the farmer plants 30 acres of wheat.\n\nNow, since the corn is three times the wheat, we can find the corn acres:\n\nCorn = 3 * W = 3 * 30 = 90 acres\n\nLet's check if this makes sense. Total land is 30 acres of wheat plus 90 acres of corn, which equals 120 acres. That matches the total land he has. Also, 90 is indeed three times 30, so the relationship holds.\n\nSo, the farmer plants 30 acres of wheat and 90 acres of corn.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ acres of wheat and } 90 \\text{ acres of corn}} \\]"
