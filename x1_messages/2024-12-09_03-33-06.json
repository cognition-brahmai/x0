        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a car that's traveling in two different phases: first, it goes at 50 miles per hour for 4 hours, and then it speeds up to 70 miles per hour for another 3 hours. We need to find out the total distance it covers.\n\nOkay, so for the first part, it's going at 50 miles per hour for 4 hours. I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, distance equals speed times time, or d = s * t.\n\nSo, for the first phase:\n\nd1 = 50 mph * 4 hours = 200 miles.\n\nGot it.\n\nNow, for the second phase, it's going faster, 70 miles per hour, for 3 hours. So, using the same formula:\n\nd2 = 70 mph * 3 hours = 210 miles.\n\nAlright, now to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together.\n\nTotal distance = d1 + d2 = 200 miles + 210 miles = 410 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me see: the car first travels at 50 mph for 4 hours, which is indeed 200 miles. Then it travels at 70 mph for 3 hours, which is 210 miles. Adding them up gives 410 miles.\n\nHmm, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe calculating the average speed overall and then multiplying by the total time.\n\nLet's try that. Total time traveled is 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.\n\nNow, to find the average speed, it would be the total distance divided by the total time. But wait, we don't know the total distance yet, that's what we're trying to find.\n\nSo, maybe that's not the way to go. Or is there another approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the problem in terms of graphs, like plotting speed against time, and then finding the area under the curve, which would give us the distance.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating things, since we have constant speeds for different intervals.\n\nLet me consider another angle. What if the car didn't change speed, and kept going at 50 mph for all 7 hours? Then the distance would be 50 * 7 = 350 miles. But it didn't; it went faster for the last 3 hours.\n\nSo, the additional speed for those 3 hours accounts for extra distance. Let's see: for those 3 hours, instead of going at 50 mph, it went at 70 mph, which is 20 mph faster.\n\nSo, in those 3 hours, it covered an extra 20 mph * 3 hours = 60 miles, compared to if it had stayed at 50 mph.\n\nTherefore, the total distance would be the distance if it had gone at 50 mph for 7 hours, which is 350 miles, plus the extra 60 miles, totaling 410 miles.\n\nOkay, this matches what I got earlier. So, that gives me more confidence that 410 miles is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Is the car traveling on the same route without any stops or changes in direction? The problem doesn't specify, so I'm assuming it's a straight path with no stops.\n\nAlso, are there any units I need to convert? The speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The total distance traveled by the car is 410 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{410} \\]"
