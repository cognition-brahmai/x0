        "content": "The character Jay Gatsby in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel \"The Great Gatsby\" is often associated with the color green, but it's not accurate to say he obsesses over it. Green in the novel symbolizes various themes, including wealth, jealousy, and the American Dream. Gatsby's obsession is more accurately directed towards his love for Daisy Buchanan and his desire to be with her again, which is reflected in his parties and his relentless pursuit of status and wealth.\n\nHowever, the color green does play a significant role in the novel. For instance, the green light at the end of Daisy's dock is a central symbol that represents Gatsby's hopes and dreams for the future, particularly his longing for Daisy. The color green also appears in other contexts, such as the green countryside and the green breast of the new world, which can symbolize growth, prosperity, and envy.\n\nSo while Gatsby doesn't obsess over the color green per se, the color is deeply intertwined with his character and the themes of the novel. If you have any more questions about \"The Great Gatsby\" or any other topic, feel free to ask!"
