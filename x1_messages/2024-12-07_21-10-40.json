        "content": "Assuming the e-commerce database has tables for orders, order items, products, and categories, with appropriate relationships between them, the SQL query would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.category_name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_sales\nFROM categories c\nJOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id\nJOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id\nJOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id\nWHERE o.order_date >= DATEADD(month, -1, GETDATE())\nGROUP BY c.category_name\nORDER BY total_sales DESC;\n```\n\nThis query calculates the total sales for each product category in the last month by joining the categories, products, order_items, and orders tables. It filters orders based on the order_date being within the last month, calculates the total sales per category by summing the product of quantity and unit_price from order_items, and finally sorts the results in descending order of total_sales.\n\nPlease note that the function `DATEADD(month, -1, GETDATE())` is used to get the date one month ago from the current date. This function is specific to SQL Server; if you're using a different SQL database system, you might need to adjust this part accordingly. For example, in MySQL, you would use `DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)` instead.\n\nAlso, ensure that the table and column names match those in your actual database schema. The provided query is based on common e-commerce database structures but may need adjustments to fit specific schemas."
