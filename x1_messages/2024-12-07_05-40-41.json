        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of pens: blue ones that cost $1.50 each and red ones that cost $2.00 each. The customer bought a total of 12 pens and spent $22.50. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue pens.\n\n- Let \\( r \\) be the number of red pens.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of pens is 12.\n\n2. The total cost is $22.50.\n\nSo, I can write two equations:\n\n1. \\( b + r = 12 \\) (since the total number of pens is 12)\n\n2. \\( 1.50b + 2.00r = 22.50 \\) (since the total cost is $22.50)\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I need to solve for \\( b \\) and \\( r \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( b \\):\n\n\\( b = 12 - r \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( b \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 1.50(12 - r) + 2.00r = 22.50 \\)\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for \\( r \\):\n\nFirst, distribute the 1.50:\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times 12 = 18.00 \\)\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times (-r) = -1.50r \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( 18.00 - 1.50r + 2.00r = 22.50 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\( 18.00 + ( -1.50r + 2.00r ) = 22.50 \\)\n\n\\( 18.00 + 0.50r = 22.50 \\)\n\nNext, subtract 18.00 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.50r = 4.50 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50 to solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\( r = \\frac{4.50}{0.50} \\)\n\n\\( r = 9 \\)\n\nSo, the customer bought 9 red pens.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation for \\( b \\):\n\n\\( b = 12 - r \\)\n\n\\( b = 12 - 9 \\)\n\n\\( b = 3 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 3 blue pens and 9 red pens.\n\nTo double-check, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 1.50 = 4.50 \\) (for blue pens)\n\n\\( 9 \\times 2.00 = 18.00 \\) (for red pens)\n\nTotal: \\( 4.50 + 18.00 = 22.50 \\)\n\nYes, that matches the total amount spent. So, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ blue pens and } 9 \\text{ red pens}} \\]"
