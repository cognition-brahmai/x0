        "content": "Let's tackle this train problem step by step. So, we have two stations, A and B, which are 480 miles apart. One train leaves Station A at 9 AM going towards Station B at 60 miles per hour. Another train leaves Station B at 10 AM going towards Station A at 80 miles per hour. We need to find out when these two trains will meet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how far each train has traveled by the time they meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up, which might help in calculating the time they take to cover the distance between them.\n\nLet me consider the time traveled by each train. The first train leaves at 9 AM and the second at 10 AM, so there's a one-hour difference. That means the first train has been traveling for one hour before the second train even starts.\n\nIn that one hour, the first train would have covered some distance. Let's calculate that. Speed is 60 mph, so in one hour, it covers 60 miles. So, by 10 AM, when the second train starts, the remaining distance between the two trains is 480 miles minus the 60 miles already covered by the first train, which is 420 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. The first train is going at 60 mph and the second at 80 mph. So, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nNow, we have a remaining distance of 420 miles, and they're approaching each other at 140 mph. The time it takes for them to meet can be found by dividing the distance by their relative speed: time = distance / speed = 420 miles / 140 mph.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 420 divided by 140 is 3 hours.\n\nSo, the second train starts at 10 AM, and they will meet 3 hours later, which would be at 1 PM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The first train has a head start of one hour, covering 60 miles, leaving 420 miles between them at 10 AM. Then, both trains are closing that gap at a combined speed of 140 mph, so 420 miles divided by 140 mph does indeed give 3 hours. Adding 3 hours to 10 AM brings us to 1 PM.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total time each train has been traveling when they meet. Let's say the first train has been traveling for t hours when they meet. Since the second train started an hour later, it has been traveling for t - 1 hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the first train is 60t miles, and the distance covered by the second train is 80(t - 1) miles. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they've covered should equal the initial distance between the stations, which is 480 miles.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n60t + 80(t - 1) = 480\n\nLet me solve for t:\n\n60t + 80t - 80 = 480\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n140t - 80 = 480\n\nAdding 80 to both sides:\n\n140t = 560\n\nDividing both sides by 140:\n\nt = 4 hours\n\nSo, the first train has been traveling for 4 hours when they meet. Since it left at 9 AM, adding 4 hours brings us to 1 PM.\n\nWait, earlier I got 1 PM by a different method, and now again I'm getting 1 PM. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this problem to confirm. Maybe using relative speed from the perspective of one train.\n\nSuppose we consider the first train's motion. It's moving at 60 mph, and the second train starts an hour later at 80 mph in the opposite direction.\n\nFrom the first train's perspective, the second train is approaching it at a relative speed of 60 + 80 = 140 mph, since they're moving towards each other.\n\nBut the first train has already covered 60 miles by the time the second train starts, so the remaining distance is 420 miles, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the time for the second train to cover that 420 miles at the relative speed of 140 mph is indeed 3 hours, leading to the meeting time at 1 PM.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the time from 9 AM, the first train has been traveling for t hours, and the second train for t - 1 hours, leading to the same equation as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The answer should be 1 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1\\ \\text{PM}} \\]"
