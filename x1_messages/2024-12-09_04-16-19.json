        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a roller coaster with a maximum capacity of 24 passengers per train, and each train completes one ride every 3 minutes. The park operates for 12 hours each day. We need to find out the maximum number of passengers the roller coaster can accommodate daily and estimate the waiting time for each passenger, assuming there are 2000 visitors per day and a uniform distribution of riders throughout the operating hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the maximum number of passengers the roller coaster can handle in a day.\n\n1. **Determine the number of rides per day:**\n\n   - The park operates for 12 hours a day.\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so total minutes per day is \\(12 \\times 60 = 720\\) minutes.\n   - Each ride takes 3 minutes, so the number of rides per day is \\(720 \\div 3 = 240\\) rides.\n\n2. **Calculate the total passenger capacity per day:**\n\n   - Each train can carry 24 passengers.\n   - So, total passengers per day are \\(240\\) rides \\(\\times 24\\) passengers = \\(5760\\) passengers.\n\nSo, the roller coaster can accommodate up to 5760 passengers daily.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the waiting time for each passenger, assuming there are 2000 visitors per day and a uniform distribution of riders throughout the operating hours.\n\n3. **Determine the total number of rides needed for 2000 visitors:**\n\n   - Since the roller coaster can carry 24 passengers per ride, the number of rides required for 2000 visitors is \\(2000 \\div 24\\).\n\n   Let's calculate that:\n\n   \\[2000 \\div 24 = 83.\\overline{3}\\]\n\n   So, approximately 83.33 rides are needed. Since you can't have a fraction of a ride, we'll consider 84 rides are needed to accommodate all 2000 visitors.\n\n4. **Calculate the total time required to complete 84 rides:**\n\n   - Each ride takes 3 minutes, so for 84 rides, it would be \\(84 \\times 3 = 252\\) minutes.\n\n5. **Determine the operating time in minutes:**\n\n   - The park operates for 12 hours a day, which is \\(12 \\times 60 = 720\\) minutes.\n\n6. **Calculate the number of rides that can be completed in the operating time:**\n\n   - As calculated earlier, 240 rides can be completed in 720 minutes.\n\n7. **Estimate the waiting time per passenger:**\n\n   - If the roller coaster can complete 240 rides in 720 minutes, but only 84 rides are needed for 2000 visitors, it seems there's some confusion here.\n\n   Wait a minute. Let's rethink this.\n\n   If the roller coaster can do 240 rides in a day, carrying 24 passengers each, that's 5760 passengers. But we're told there are only 2000 visitors per day.\n\n   So, actually, the roller coaster can handle 5760 passengers, but there are only 2000 visitors. That means not all the capacity is used.\n\n   But the question is about estimating the waiting time per passenger, assuming 2000 visitors per day.\n\n   Perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\n   Let's consider that visitors arrive uniformly throughout the 12-hour day.\n\n   Total operating time: 12 hours = 720 minutes.\n\n   Number of visitors: 2000.\n\n   So, the arrival rate of visitors is \\( \\lambda = \\frac{2000 \\text{ visitors}}{720 \\text{ minutes}} \\approx 2.778 \\) visitors per minute.\n\n   Now, the service rate of the roller coaster is one train every 3 minutes, carrying 24 passengers.\n\n   So, the service rate \\( \\mu = \\frac{24 \\text{ passengers}}{3 \\text{ minutes}} = 8 \\) passengers per minute.\n\n   This looks like a queuing theory problem, specifically an M/M/1 queue, where arrivals are Poisson and service times are exponential.\n\n   In an M/M/1 queue, the average waiting time in the system (W) is given by:\n\n   \\[ W = \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda} \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[ W = \\frac{1}{8 - 2.778} = \\frac{1}{5.222} \\approx 0.1915 \\] minutes per passenger.\n\n   But this seems too low. Let's verify the approach.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of total time required to serve all passengers.\n\n   Total number of passengers: 2000.\n\n   Each ride serves 24 passengers every 3 minutes.\n\n   So, the number of rides needed is \\( \\frac{2000}{24} \\approx 83.33 \\) rides.\n\n   Total time required to serve all passengers: \\( 83.33 \\times 3 = 250 \\) minutes.\n\n   But the park operates for 720 minutes.\n\n   So, the average waiting time per passenger can be estimated by dividing the total time required to serve all passengers by the number of passengers.\n\n   Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\n   Maybe a better approach is to calculate the average waiting time based on the utilization factor.\n\n   Utilization factor (rho, \u03c1) is the ratio of arrival rate to service rate.\n\n   Here, \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu} = \\frac{2.778}{8} = 0.34725 \\).\n\n   In queuing theory, the average waiting time in the queue (Wq) for an M/M/1 queue is:\n\n   \\[ Wq = \\frac{\\rho}{\\mu(1 - \\rho)} \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[ Wq = \\frac{0.34725}{8(1 - 0.34725)} = \\frac{0.34725}{8 \\times 0.65275} = \\frac{0.34725}{5.222} \\approx 0.0665 \\] minutes.\n\n   That's about 3.99 seconds per passenger.\n\n   But this seems too short, considering the number of visitors and the operating hours.\n\n   Maybe I need to consider that multiple passengers are in the system at the same time.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the average waiting time based on the total time required to serve all passengers and the number of passengers.\n\n   Total time required to serve all passengers is 250 minutes, as calculated earlier.\n\n   Total number of passengers is 2000.\n\n   So, average waiting time per passenger is \\( \\frac{250 \\text{ minutes}}{2000 \\text{ passengers}} = 0.125 \\) minutes per passenger, which is 7.5 seconds.\n\n   This is closer to the previous calculation.\n\n   However, this seems counterintuitive because if the total time required to serve all passengers is 250 minutes, and there are 2000 passengers, then the average time each passenger spends waiting in line would be less than a minute, which seems too short for such a high number of visitors.\n\n   Maybe I need to consider the queuing more carefully.\n\n   Let's try another approach.\n\n   Assume that passengers arrive uniformly throughout the 720 minutes.\n\n   Passengers per minute: \\( \\frac{2000}{720} \\approx 2.778 \\).\n\n   Service rate: 8 passengers per minute.\n\n   Since the service rate is higher than the arrival rate, the queue should be manageable.\n\n   The formula for average waiting time in an M/M/1 queue is:\n\n   \\[ Wq = \\frac{\\rho}{\\mu(1 - \\rho)} \\]\n\n   Where:\n\n   - \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu} \\) is the utilization factor.\n\n   - \\( \\lambda \\) is the arrival rate.\n\n   - \\( \\mu \\) is the service rate.\n\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n\n   \\[ \\rho = \\frac{2.778}{8} = 0.34725 \\]\n\n   \\[ Wq = \\frac{0.34725}{8(1 - 0.34725)} = \\frac{0.34725}{8 \\times 0.65275} = \\frac{0.34725}{5.222} \\approx 0.0665 \\] minutes.\n\n   Which is approximately 3.99 seconds.\n\n   This seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\n   Therefore, the average waiting time per passenger is roughly 4 seconds.\n\n   However, this seems too short given the number of visitors and the operating hours. Maybe there's a mistake in the approach.\n\n   Let's consider that the roller coaster has a finite capacity and that passengers have to wait for their turn based on the ride's frequency.\n\n   Each ride takes 3 minutes, and each train can carry 24 passengers.\n\n   In 720 minutes, the roller coaster can run 240 rides, accommodating up to 5760 passengers.\n\n   But there are only 2000 visitors, so the roller coaster isn't operating at full capacity.\n\n   Perhaps the waiting time should be calculated based on the demand.\n\n   Let's try calculating the total ride time required for 2000 passengers.\n\n   Number of rides needed: \\( \\frac{2000}{24} \\approx 83.33 \\) rides.\n\n   Time required: \\( 83.33 \\times 3 = 250 \\) minutes.\n\n   Now, if the park operates for 720 minutes, and the total ride time needed is 250 minutes, then the average waiting time per passenger can be calculated as follows:\n\n   Total time passengers spend waiting and riding:\n\n   - Total ride time: 250 minutes.\n\n   - Total waiting time: \\( Wq \\times 2000 \\), where \\( Wq \\) is the average waiting time per passenger.\n\n   - Total time in the system per passenger: \\( W = Wq + \\text{ride time per passenger} \\).\n\n   But ride time per passenger is the ride duration divided by the number of passengers per ride.\n\n   Wait, no. The ride time is 3 minutes per ride, and each ride carries 24 passengers.\n\n   So, for each passenger, the ride time is 3 minutes.\n\n   Therefore, total time in the system per passenger is \\( W = Wq + 3 \\) minutes.\n\n   Total time spent by all passengers in the system is \\( 2000 \\times W \\).\n\n   This should equal the sum of all individual waiting times plus the total ride time.\n\n   But this seems to be getting complicated.\n\n   Maybe a simpler approach is to consider that the total time required to serve all passengers is 250 minutes, and since the passengers are distributed uniformly over 720 minutes, the waiting time per passenger depends on how the rides are spaced out.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of passengers waiting at any given time.\n\n   Let's calculate the number of passengers arriving per minute: \\( \\lambda = \\frac{2000}{720} \\approx 2.778 \\) passengers per minute.\n\n   The number of passengers that can be served per minute is \\( \\mu = \\frac{24}{3} = 8 \\) passengers per minute.\n\n   Since \\( \\mu > \\lambda \\), the queue is stable.\n\n   The average number of passengers in the system (waiting plus being served) is given by Little's law:\n\n   \\[ L = \\lambda \\times W \\]\n\n   Where \\( W \\) is the average time spent in the system per passenger.\n\n   We also have:\n\n   \\[ Lq = \\frac{\\rho^2}{1 - \\rho} \\]\n\n   Where \\( Lq \\) is the average number of passengers in the queue.\n\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n\n   \\[ Lq = \\frac{(0.34725)^2}{1 - 0.34725} = \\frac{0.1206}{0.65275} \\approx 0.1847 \\] passengers in the queue on average.\n\n   Then, the average waiting time in the queue is:\n\n   \\[ Wq = \\frac{Lq}{\\lambda} = \\frac{0.1847}{2.778} \\approx 0.0665 \\] minutes, which again is about 4 seconds.\n\n   This consistency suggests that the waiting time is indeed around 4 seconds per passenger.\n\n   However, this seems counterintuitive because with 2000 passengers in 720 minutes, and each ride taking 3 minutes for 24 passengers, one might expect longer waiting times.\n\n   Perhaps the issue is that the service rate is being calculated per minute, but the ride time is in minutes.\n\n   Let me try redefining the service rate.\n\n   The roller coaster can serve 24 passengers every 3 minutes, which is equivalent to 8 passengers per minute, as I calculated earlier.\n\n   Given that the arrival rate is 2.778 passengers per minute, and the service rate is 8 passengers per minute, the system can handle the load without significant waiting times.\n\n   Therefore, the average waiting time per passenger is approximately 4 seconds.\n\n   So, to summarize:\n\n   - Maximum daily capacity: 5760 passengers.\n\n   - Average waiting time per passenger: approximately 4 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe maximum number of passengers the roller coaster can accommodate daily is \\boxed{5760}, and the average waiting time per passenger is approximately \\boxed{4 \\text{ seconds}}."
