Nah, I don't think there's a musical instrument called a spoon, unless you're thinking about spoon taps or something. Maybe a sieve? No, that doesn't ring a bell. Oh, wait, is it a strainer? Hmm, not sure.\n\nLet me try another approach. What musical instruments start with 'S'?\" There's the saxophone, but that's not a kitchen utensil. There's the synthesizer, but that's electronic music gear. Oh, there's the spoons! Wait, spoons are used in music, right? Like spoon clicking or something?\n\nYes, I recall that in some folk music, especially Irish and Scottish, there's a form of percussion where people clash spoons together. So, spoons are both a kitchen utensil and a musical instrument.\n\nBut let's double-check. Spoons are definitely used in cooking for stirring, serving, eating, etc. And in music, particularly in rhythmic patterns where they're clicked together or played against a surface to create beats.\n\nSo, the answer should be spoons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{spoons}} \\]"
