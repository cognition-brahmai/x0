        "content": "Let's tackle this bonus distribution problem step by step. So, we've got a company that's decided to give a total bonus of $600 to its employees. There are 3 managers and 17 regular employees. The twist here is that managers receive 50% more than the regular employees. Our goal is to find out how much each manager and each regular employee gets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a fixed total bonus amount, and we need to split it between managers and regular employees, with managers getting a higher amount specifically 50% more than the regular employees.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say each regular employee gets a certain amount, which I'll call \"x\" dollars. Since managers get 50% more than the regular employees, each manager would get \"x + 0.5x\" which simplifies to \"1.5x\" dollars.\n\nNow, we have 17 regular employees and 3 managers. So, the total bonus can be expressed as the sum of the bonuses for all regular employees plus the sum of the bonuses for all managers.\n\nIn other words:\n\nTotal bonus = (number of regular employees * bonus per regular employee) + (number of managers * bonus per manager)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n600 = (17 * x) + (3 * 1.5x)\n\nNow, let's simplify that equation.\n\nFirst, calculate the total bonus for regular employees: 17x\n\nThen, calculate the total bonus for managers: 3 * 1.5x = 4.5x\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n600 = 17x + 4.5x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n600 = 21.5x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 600 / 21.5\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n600 divided by 21.5...\n\nFirst, 21.5 times 20 is 430.\n\nSubtract 430 from 600: 600 - 430 = 170.\n\nNow, 21.5 times 8 is 172.\n\nSubtract 172 from 170: wait, that's over. So, 21.5 times 7 is 150.5.\n\n170 - 150.5 = 19.5.\n\nNow, 21.5 times 0.9 is 19.35.\n\n19.5 - 19.35 = 0.15.\n\nSo, x is approximately 20 + 7 + 0.9 = 27.9 dollars.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem precise. Maybe I should use division directly.\n\n600 \u00f7 21.5 = ?\n\nWell, 21.5 goes into 600 how many times?\n\n21.5 * 27.9 = let's check:\n\n21.5 * 20 = 430\n\n21.5 * 7 = 150.5\n\nTotal: 430 + 150.5 = 580.5\n\nDifference: 600 - 580.5 = 19.5\n\nNow, 21.5 * 0.9 = 19.35\n\nAdd that to 580.5: 580.5 + 19.35 = 600 - 0.15, almost.\n\nSo, x \u2248 27.9 dollars.\n\nBut for accuracy, I'll use the exact division.\n\n600 \u00f7 21.5 = 6000 \u00f7 215 = 27.90697674... Let's round it to two decimal places: $27.91 per regular employee.\n\nNow, each manager gets 1.5 times that amount.\n\nSo, manager's bonus = 1.5 * 27.91 = let's calculate that.\n\n1.5 * 27.91 = 41.865, which rounds to $41.87 per manager.\n\nBut wait, let's check if the total adds up to $600.\n\nTotal from regular employees: 17 * 27.91 = let's see.\n\n17 * 27 = 459\n\n17 * 0.91 = 15.47\n\nTotal: 459 + 15.47 = 474.47\n\nTotal from managers: 3 * 41.87 = 125.61\n\nNow, sum them up: 474.47 + 125.61 = 599.99 + 0.10 = $600.08\n\nHmm, slightly over. Maybe it's due to rounding. Let's adjust.\n\nPerhaps we should use the exact value of x without rounding.\n\nx = 600 / 21.5 = 27.906976744186046 dollars\n\nLet's keep more decimal places for accuracy.\n\nSo, x \u2248 27.907 dollars per regular employee.\n\nThen, manager's bonus = 1.5 * 27.907 = 41.8605 \u2248 $41.86 per manager.\n\nNow, recalculate the totals.\n\nRegular employees: 17 * 27.907 = 474.419 dollars\n\nManagers: 3 * 41.8605 = 125.5815 dollars\n\nTotal: 474.419 + 125.5815 = 600.0005 dollars, which is effectively $600.\n\nSo, the slight discrepancy was due to rounding. It works out.\n\nTherefore, each regular employee receives approximately $27.91, and each manager receives approximately $41.86.\n\nBut to be precise, we can say:\n\n- Regular employee bonus: $27.91\n\n- Manager bonus: $41.86\n\nAnd the total bonus distributed is $600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Each regular employee receives } \\$27.91 \\text{ and each manager receives } \\$41.86.} \\]"
