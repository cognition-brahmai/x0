        "content": "So I've got this problem here: in a certain city, it rains every third day. I need to find out the probability that it will rain exactly three times in a week. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"it rains every third day\" means. Does it mean that it rains exactly every three days, like on days 3, 6, 9, and so on? Or does it mean that the probability of rain on any given day is such that, on average, it rains every third day?\n\nI think the latter interpretation makes more sense in the context of probability. So, if it rains every third day on average, that means the probability of rain on any given day is 1/3.\n\nAlright, so probability of rain on any day, p = 1/3.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that it rains exactly three times in a week. Assuming a week has 7 days.\n\nThis sounds like a binomial probability problem. In binomial probability, the probability of getting exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials is given by the formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (days in a week, so n=7)\n\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days, so k=3)\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (probability of rain on any given day, p=1/3)\n\n- \"n choose k\" is the binomial coefficient, which is n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = (7 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^4\n\nFirst, calculate \"7 choose 3\":\n\n7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / (3*2*1 * 4*3*2*1) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1) = 210 / 6 = 35\n\nNext, (1/3)^3 = 1/27\n\nThen, (2/3)^4 = (16/81)\n\nNow, multiply them all together:\n\nP(X = 3) = 35 * (1/27) * (16/81) = 35 * 16 / (27 * 81) = 560 / 2187\n\nLet me check if this fraction can be simplified. 560 and 2187 don't have any common factors besides 1, so it's already in simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the decimal value:\n\n560 / 2187 \u2248 0.2561\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2561, or 25.61%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the Poisson distribution, since it deals with events happening at a certain rate over time.\n\nIf it rains every third day, that's like a rate of 1/3 per day. Over a week (7 days), the expected number of rainy days, \u03bb, would be 7 * (1/3) = 7/3 \u2248 2.333.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-\u03bb) * \u03bb^k) / k!\n\nSo, P(X = 3) = (e^(-7/3) * (7/3)^3) / 3!\n\nLet me calculate this.\n\nFirst, e^(-7/3) \u2248 e^(-2.333) \u2248 0.1003\n\nThen, (7/3)^3 = (7/3) * (7/3) * (7/3) = (343 / 27) \u2248 12.7037\n\nAnd 3! = 6\n\nSo, P(X = 3) = 0.1003 * 12.7037 / 6 \u2248 0.1003 * 2.1173 \u2248 0.2122\n\nHmm, that's approximately 0.2122, or 21.22%, which is different from the binomial probability I calculated earlier.\n\nWhy the difference? Which one is correct?\n\nI think the binomial model is more appropriate here because we have a fixed number of independent trials (days in a week), each with the same probability of success (rain).\n\nThe Poisson distribution is often used for modeling the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant mean rate of occurrence. In this case, since we have a known probability of rain each day, the binomial distribution is more straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the binomial probability of 560/2187 or approximately 25.61% is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret \"it rains every third day.\"\n\nMaybe it means that it rains exactly every three days, with certainty. So, in a week, it would rain on days 3 and 6, for example, with no variability.\n\nBut that would mean it rains exactly twice in a week, assuming the week starts on day 1. But the problem asks for the probability that it rains exactly three times in a week, so that interpretation doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"it rains every third day\" means that the rains are spaced three days apart, but with some randomness in the starting point.\n\nBut I think the initial interpretation of p = 1/3 per day is the most reasonable.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the \"every third day\" refers to a cyclical pattern, like it rains on every third day in a repeating cycle.\n\nFor example, if the week starts on day 1, it would rain on day 3 and day 6.\n\nBut that's only two rainy days in a week, which doesn't match the problem's request for exactly three rainy days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is over a longer period.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a repeating cycle every three days, and see how that fits into a week.\n\nLet's consider the days of the week as days 1 through 7.\n\nIf it rains every third day, starting from day 1, it would rain on day 1, day 4, and day 7.\n\nThat's three rainy days in a week: days 1, 4, and 7.\n\nAlternatively, if it starts on day 2, it would rain on day 2, day 5, and day 8 (which is beyond the week).\n\nSo, in that case, only days 2 and 5 would be rainy days in the week.\n\nIf it starts on day 3, it would rain on day 3, day 6, and day 9 (beyond the week), so only days 3 and 6 are rainy.\n\nStarting on day 4: days 4 and 7.\n\nStarting on day 5: day 5.\n\nStarting on day 6: day 6.\n\nStarting on day 7: day 7.\n\nSo, depending on the starting day, the number of rainy days in a week can be 2 or 3.\n\nWait a minute, only when starting on day 1, it rains on days 1, 4, and 7, which are three days.\n\nIn other cases, it's only two days.\n\nBut the problem asks for the probability that it rains exactly three times in a week, implying that there is some variability in the starting point.\n\nPerhaps we can consider that the starting day of the rain cycle is uniformly distributed over the seven days of the week.\n\nSo, there are seven possible starting points, each with equal probability of 1/7.\n\nOut of these seven starting points, only one results in three rainy days (starting on day 1).\n\nThe other six starting points result in only two rainy days.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it rains exactly three times in a week is 1/7.\n\nWait, but this seems too straightforward. Is there more to it?\n\nLet me verify.\n\nIf the rain cycle starts on day 1, rainy days are 1,4,7 (three days).\n\nStarts on day 2: 2,5 (two days).\n\nStarts on day 3: 3,6 (two days).\n\nStarts on day 4: 4,7 (two days).\n\nStarts on day 5: 5 (one day).\n\nStarts on day 6: 6 (one day).\n\nStarts on day 7: 7 (one day).\n\nSo, only one out of seven starting points results in three rainy days.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/7.\n\nBut earlier, using the binomial model, I got approximately 0.2561, which is roughly 1/4.\n\nThese two approaches are giving different answers.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet's think about this differently.\n\nThe binomial model assumes that each day has an independent probability of 1/3 of raining, which may not accurately capture the \"every third day\" pattern.\n\nIn reality, \"every third day\" suggests a regular interval, not independent daily probabilities.\n\nTherefore, the binomial model might not be the best fit here.\n\nOn the other hand, the cyclical model where the starting point is uniformly distributed over the seven days seems more accurate in capturing the \"every third day\" pattern.\n\nIn this model, only one starting point out of seven leads to three rainy days in a week, so the probability is 1/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to model this.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the rainy days in the week.\n\nSince it rains every third day, the rainy days are spaced three days apart.\n\nSo, if it rains on day x, then on day x+3, x+6, etc.\n\nIn a seven-day week, the possible sets of rainy days are:\n\n- {1,4,7}\n\n- {2,5}\n\n- {3,6}\n\n- {7}\n\nWait, not {7} alone, because starting on day 5 would be day 5 and day 8 (which is beyond the week), but day 8 is not in the week, so only day 5.\n\nSimilarly, starting on day 6 is day 6, and starting on day 7 is day 7.\n\nSo, the possible rainy day sets are:\n\n- {1,4,7}\n\n- {2,5}\n\n- {3,6}\n\n- {5}\n\n- {6}\n\n- {7}\n\nOut of these, only one set has three rainy days: {1,4,7}.\n\nThere are a total of seven possible starting points, each equally likely.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/7.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the cycle is every three days, and seven and three are coprime, the cycle will repeat every three weeks.\n\nWait, no, seven and three are coprime, so the cycle repeats every three weeks.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of ways to have exactly three rainy days in a week, given the \"every third day\" constraint.\n\nFrom the earlier analysis, only starting on day 1 gives three rainy days in a week.\n\nTherefore, with seven possible starting points, each equally likely, the probability is 1/7.\n\nBut I recall that in some repeating cycle problems, the probability might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the number of times each starting point occurs in a longer period.\n\nBut given that the starting point is uniformly distributed, I think 1/7 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nSuppose we think of the week as a circle, with seven days.\n\nThen, placing rainy days every three days would give different patterns depending on the starting point.\n\nBut in a seven-day cycle, with steps of three days, we have:\n\n- Starting at day 1: 1,4,7\n\n- Starting at day 2: 2,5\n\n- Starting at day 3: 3,6\n\n- Starting at day 4: 4,7,1\n\n- Starting at day 5: 5,1\n\n- Starting at day 6: 6,2\n\n- Starting at day 7: 7,3\n\nWait, if we consider the cycle to wrap around, then starting at day 4 would give 4,7,1 (which is similar to starting at day 1).\n\nSimilarly, starting at day 5: 5,1 (similar to starting at day 2).\n\nStarting at day 6: 6,2 (similar to starting at day 3).\n\nStarting at day 7: 7,3 (similar to starting at day 4).\n\nWait, but in a seven-day week, with rain every three days, and considering the week as a cycle, some starting points lead to the same set of rainy days.\n\nFor example, starting at day 1: 1,4,7\n\nStarting at day 4: 4,7,1 (same as starting at day 1)\n\nSimilarly, starting at day 2: 2,5, (and 2+3=5, 5+3=8 which is 1, but 1 is already in the set)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nIn a seven-day week, with rain every three days, the number of distinct cycles depends on the greatest common divisor of 3 and 7, which is 1, since 3 and 7 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, the cycle will hit all seven days before repeating.\n\nBut in a single week, depending on the starting day, the number of rainy days varies.\n\nFrom earlier, only starting on day 1 gives three rainy days in the week.\n\nTherefore, the probability remains 1/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the process over multiple weeks to see the pattern.\n\nBut given that the problem is focused on a single week, and assuming the starting point is uniformly distributed, 1/7 seems correct.\n\nHowever, earlier, using the binomial model with p=1/3 gave a different result.\n\nI think the binomial model is not appropriate here because it assumes independence between days, which is not the case with the \"every third day\" constraint.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to consider the cyclical nature of the rain pattern, leading to a probability of 1/7.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[
