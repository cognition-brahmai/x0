So, you want a Go program that simulates a producer-consumer scenario where the producer generates random numbers and the consumer calculates their average. We'll use goroutines and channels for this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a producer-consumer problem is. In this pattern, one part of the program (the producer) generates data, and another part (the consumer) processes that data. The challenge is to make sure that the producer doesn't overwhelm the consumer with too much data at once, and that the consumer doesn't try to process data that isn't available yet.\n\nIn Go, we can use channels to communicate between the producer and consumer goroutines. Channels provide a way to synchronize data passing between goroutines and can be used to implement this pattern efficiently.\n\nHere's a basic outline of what we'll do:\n\n1. Create a channel to pass the random numbers from the producer to the consumer.\n2. Start a goroutine for the producer that generates random numbers and sends them into the channel.\n3. Start another goroutine for the consumer that reads numbers from the channel, calculates their average, and prints it.\n4. Use some mechanism to signal when the producer is done sending numbers, so the consumer knows when to stop waiting for new numbers.\n\nWe'll also need to handle potential issues like the producer finishing before the consumer has processed all the numbers, or vice versa. To manage this, we can use a finite channel buffer or use a wait group to ensure all data is processed before the program exits.\n\nLet's dive into the code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Go program that simulates a producer-consumer scenario using goroutines and channels. The producer will generate random numbers, and the consumer will calculate their average.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Channels**: Use a channel to pass random numbers from the producer to the consumer.\n2. **Goroutines**: \n   - Start one goroutine for the producer to generate random numbers and send them into the channel.\n   - Start another goroutine for the consumer to read numbers from the channel, calculate their average, and print it.\n3. **Synchronization**: \n   - Use a separate channel to signal when the producer is done sending numbers.\n   - The consumer will wait for this signal to know when to stop processing.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math/rand\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\nfunc producer(ch chan int, done chan bool) {\n\tdefer close(done)\n\tfor i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\n\t\tnum := rand.Intn(100) // Generate a random number between 0 and 99\n\t\tch <- num\n\t\ttime.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 500) // Sleep for half a second\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc consumer(ch chan int, done chan bool) {\n\tvar sum int\n\tcount := 0\n\tfor num := range ch {\n\t\tsum += num\n\t\tcount++\n\t}\n\tavg := float64(sum) / float64(count)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Average: %.2f\\n\", avg)\n\t<-done // Wait for the producer to finish\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\trand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) // Seed the random number generator\n\n\tch := make(chan int)\n\tdone := make(chan bool)\n\n\tgo producer(ch, done)\n\tgo consumer(ch, done)\n\n\t<-done // Wait for the producer to finish\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Producer Function**:\n   - Generates 10 random numbers between 0 and 99.\n   - Sends each number to the channel `ch`.\n   - Sleeps for 500 milliseconds between each number generation.\n   - Closes the `done` channel to signal that it has finished generating numbers.\n\n2. **Consumer Function**:\n   - Reads numbers from the channel `ch` until the channel is closed.\n   - Calculates the sum and count of the numbers.\n   - Computes the average once all numbers have been read.\n   - Waits for the `done` channel to ensure the producer has finished.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Seeds the random number generator.\n   - Creates the channels `ch` for numbers and `done` for synchronization.\n   - Starts the producer and consumer goroutines.\n   - Waits for the `done` channel to ensure the producer has finished before the program exits.\n\nThis approach ensures that the consumer correctly calculates the average of all numbers produced by the producer and handles the synchronization between the two goroutines effectively."
