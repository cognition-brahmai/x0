        "content": "Let's see. The car dealership sells cars at an average price of $25,000 each, and they're offering a 15% discount during a sale event. If they sell 50 cars during this event, I need to find out how much revenue they would generate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the discounted price of each car is. If they're giving a 15% discount on each car, that means each car is being sold for 85% of its original price, right? Because 100% - 15% = 85%.\n\nSo, the discounted price per car would be $25,000 multiplied by 85%, which is $25,000 * 0.85.\n\nLet me calculate that: $25,000 * 0.85 = $21,250 per car.\n\nNow, if they sell 50 cars at this discounted price, the total revenue would be 50 times $21,250.\n\nSo, 50 * $21,250 = $1,062,500.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the discount is 15% off $25,000, so the discount amount per car is $25,000 * 0.15 = $3,750.\n\nSubtracting the discount from the original price: $25,000 - $3,750 = $21,250 per car.\n\nThen, selling 50 cars at $21,250 each: 50 * $21,250 = $1,062,500.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as selling 50 cars at the original price and then subtracting the total discount.\n\nSo, 50 cars at $25,000 each would be 50 * $25,000 = $1,250,000.\n\nThen, the total discount is 50 * $3,750 = $187,500.\n\nSubtracting the total discount from the total original price: $1,250,000 - $187,500 = $1,062,500.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident now.\n\nTherefore, the revenue generated from selling 50 cars during the sale event would be $1,062,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1062500} \\]"
