        "content": "So the recipe says that 2 cups of sugar make 24 cookies. But I need to make 72 cookies. How do I figure out how much sugar I need for that?\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how much sugar is needed for one cookie, and then multiply that by 72. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if 2 cups of sugar make 24 cookies, then the amount of sugar per cookie would be 2 cups divided by 24 cookies. Let me do that calculation.\n\n2 divided by 24 is... hmm, 2 divided by 24 is 0.0833 cups per cookie. That seems really small. Maybe I should leave it in fractions.\n\n2 cups divided by 24 cookies is the same as 2/24, which simplifies to 1/12 cup per cookie.\n\nOkay, so each cookie requires 1/12 cup of sugar.\n\nNow, to find out how much sugar is needed for 72 cookies, I can multiply the amount of sugar per cookie by 72.\n\nSo, 1/12 cup times 72 cookies.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n1/12 times 72 is 72 divided by 12, which is 6.\n\nSo, 6 cups of sugar would be needed for 72 cookies.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 24 cookies require 2 cups of sugar, then 72 cookies would require x cups of sugar.\n\nSo, we can set up a proportion: 24 cookies is to 2 cups as 72 cookies is to x cups.\n\nThat is, 24/2 = 72/x.\n\nWait, no. Actually, proportions are set up by setting ratios equal to each other.\n\nSo, the ratio of cookies to cups should be equal.\n\nTherefore, 24 cookies / 2 cups = 72 cookies / x cups.\n\nSo, 24/2 = 72/x.\n\nWait, but 24 divided by 2 is 12, and 72 divided by x should also be 12.\n\nSo, 72 divided by x equals 12.\n\nTherefore, x = 72 / 12, which is 6 cups.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at it?\n\nMaybe by thinking about how many times larger 72 is compared to 24.\n\nSo, 72 divided by 24 is 3.\n\nThat means 72 cookies is 3 times the amount of 24 cookies.\n\nTherefore, I need 3 times the amount of sugar.\n\nSo, 2 cups times 3 is 6 cups.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nAlright, so all these methods point to needing 6 cups of sugar for 72 cookies.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I should account for.\n\nIs there any possibility that scaling up the recipe would change the sugar ratio?\n\nFor example, maybe at larger scales, some ingredients don't need to be increased proportionally.\n\nBut in this case, the recipe doesn't specify any such exceptions, so I'll assume that sugar scales linearly with the number of cookies.\n\nAlso, I should consider if measuring in cups is the best way.\n\nMaybe I should convert cups to grams for more accuracy.\n\nBut since the recipe gives sugar in cups, and I'm supposed to find the answer in cups, I'll stick with cups.\n\nMoreover, the question asks for the answer in cups, so no need to convert.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see if there's a way to verify this without doing the math.\n\nSuppose I make three batches of the original recipe.\n\nEach batch makes 24 cookies, so three batches would make 72 cookies.\n\nAnd each batch requires 2 cups of sugar, so three batches would require 6 cups of sugar.\n\nThat matches my calculation.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that 6 cups of sugar are needed for 72 cookies.\n\nOne more thing: I should consider if the sugar is packed or loosely measured.\n\nBut since the recipe doesn't specify, I'll assume that the measuring method remains consistent.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the angles here.\n\nThe answer is 6 cups of sugar needed for 72 cookies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
