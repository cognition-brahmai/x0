He's famous for creating mankind from clay and stealing fire from the gods to give to humans, which allowed them to advance culturally and technologically. This act of defiance against the chief god, Zeus, led to Prometheus being punished by being chained to a rock where an eagle ate his liver daily, only for it to regenerate and the cycle to repeat. It's a powerful story that highlights themes of creativity, suffering, and the quest for knowledge."
