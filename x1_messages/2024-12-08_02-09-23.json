Now that Voldemort's gone and everything's sort of... settled.\n\nHermione: Oh, Harry, there's so much to think about! First of all, I think we should focus on rebuilding. So many people and places were damaged in the war. Maybe we could help with that.\n\nHarry: That's a great idea. I was actually thinking about going back to Godric's Hollow. You know, to see where my parents lived, where it all began.\n\nHermione: That sounds really important, Harry. It would be a way to connect with your past, understand more about who you are. Maybe you could find some clues about your parents or even about Voldemort's early life.\n\nHarry: Yeah, maybe. Though I'm not sure what I'd find there now, after all these years. But it feels like something I need to do.\n\nHermione: I'll come with you, of course. And maybe after that, we could look into some of the magical artifacts that were lost during the war. There must be valuable knowledge in them.\n\nHarry: Artifacts sound interesting. But Hermione, don't you think it's time for us to think about our future too? Like, what we want to do with our lives now that the war is over.\n\nHermione: Well, I've been thinking about that too. I was considering going back to school, maybe studying more about magical law or something like that. What about you?\n\nHarry: I don't know yet. Maybe I'll try to be an Auror, like I always wanted. But to be honest, I'm a bit tired of fighting. Maybe I should consider something different.\n\nHermione: That's understandable, Harry. There are so many other careers in the magical world. You could be a Quidditch player, or maybe even a teacher at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry: A teacher? Hmm, maybe. I always enjoyed learning from Professor Dumbledore and McGonagall. But I don't know if I'm ready for that yet.\n\nHermione: Take your time, Harry. We're young, and we have our whole lives ahead of us. For now, let's focus on healing and exploring.\n\nHarry: Yeah, you're right. So, when do you think we should head to Godric's Hollow?\n\nHermione: How about next weekend? We can Apparate there early in the morning and spend a couple of days exploring.\n\nHarry: Perfect. I'll let Ron know too, see if he wants to come along.\n\nHermione: Great, let's make it a trio adventure once again.\n\nHarry: A trio adventure. Sounds just like old times.\n\nHermione: Only this time, without the danger, hopefully.\n\nHarry: Fingers crossed. But you know me, Hermione. Adventure seems to find me, whether I look for it or not.\n\nHermione: I know, Harry. But this time, let's make sure it's an adventure of our choosing, one that brings us peace and understanding.\n\nHarry: Agreed. Let's do this.\n\nHermione: Excellent. I'll start packing tomorrow.\n\nHarry: Me too. Can't wait to see what awaits us in Godric's Hollow.\n\nHermione: Nor I, Harry. Nor I."
