        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere's a class with 30 students: 18 girls and 12 boys. We need to find the probability that if we randomly select 5 students, exactly 3 of them will be girls.\n\nAlright, probability problems can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 5 students out of 30, regardless of gender.\n\nAnd the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose exactly 3 girls out of 18 and 2 boys out of 12.\n\nSo, it seems like we're dealing with combinations here, not permutations, because the order in which we select the students doesn't matter.\n\nLet me remember the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 students out of 30.\n\nSo, total outcomes = C(30, 5)\n\nSimilarly, favorable outcomes = C(18, 3) * C(12, 2)\n\nBecause we're choosing 3 girls from 18 and 2 boys from 12, and these are independent choices.\n\nThen, the probability would be:\n\nP = [C(18, 3) * C(12, 2)] / C(30, 5)\n\nAlright, now I need to compute these combinations.\n\nLet's start with C(30, 5).\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5! * 25!) =\n\nI don't need to calculate the full factorials, as many terms will cancel out.\n\nLet's compute it step by step.\n\n30! / 25! = 30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 26\n\nSo, C(30, 5) = (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 26) / 5!\n\nAnd 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n\nSo, C(30, 5) = (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 26) / 120\n\nLet me calculate the numerator:\n\n30 \u00d7 29 = 870\n\n870 \u00d7 28 = 24,360\n\n24,360 \u00d7 27 = 657,720\n\n657,720 \u00d7 26 = 17,100,720\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n17,100,720 / 120 = 142,506\n\nSo, C(30, 5) = 142,506\n\nNext, C(18, 3):\n\nC(18, 3) = 18! / (3! * 15!) = (18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 16) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (4,896) / 6 = 816\n\nAnd C(12, 2):\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 132 / 2 = 66\n\nNow, favorable outcomes = 816 * 66 = let's calculate that.\n\n816 \u00d7 66:\n\nFirst, 800 \u00d7 66 = 52,800\n\nPlus 16 \u00d7 66 = 1,056\n\nTotal = 52,800 + 1,056 = 53,856\n\nSo, favorable outcomes = 53,856\n\nNow, probability P = 53,856 / 142,506\n\nLet's simplify this fraction if possible.\n\nFirst, check if both numbers are divisible by 6.\n\n53,856 \u00f7 6 = 8,976\n\n142,506 \u00f7 6 = 23,751\n\nSo, P = 8,976 / 23,751\n\nCheck if these numbers have any common divisors.\n\nLet's see if both are divisible by 3.\n\n8,976 \u00f7 3 = 2,992\n\n23,751 \u00f7 3 = 7,917\n\nSo, P = 2,992 / 7,917\n\nAgain, check if divisible by 11.\n\n2,992 \u00f7 11 = 272\n\n7,917 \u00f7 11 = 721\n\nSo, P = 272 / 721\n\nNow, check if 272 and 721 have any common divisors.\n\n272 is divisible by 17: 272 \u00f7 17 = 16\n\n721 \u00f7 17 = 42.411, which is not an integer.\n\nSo, 272 and 721 have no common divisors other than 1.\n\nTherefore, the simplified probability is 272/721.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal.\n\n272 \u00f7 721 \u2248 0.377\n\nSo, P \u2248 0.377 or 37.7%\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, C(30, 5) = 142,506, that seems correct.\n\nC(18, 3) = 816, that's correct.\n\nC(12, 2) = 66, correct.\n\nFavorable outcomes = 816 * 66 = 53,856, correct.\n\nTotal outcomes = 142,506\n\nP = 53,856 / 142,506 = 53,856 \u00f7 6 = 8,976; 142,506 \u00f7 6 = 23,751\n\n8,976 / 23,751 \u00f7 3 = 2,992 / 7,917\n\n\u00f7 11 = 272 / 721\n\n272 and 721 have no common divisors, so 272/721 is the simplified fraction.\n\nAs a decimal, that's approximately 0.377, or 37.7%.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as a fraction.\n\nBut let me confirm if this makes sense.\n\nGiven that there are more girls than boys in the class, the probability of selecting exactly 3 girls out of 5 should indeed be significant.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the hypergeometric distribution formula, which is exactly what we've done here.\n\nThe hypergeometric distribution is used when we're sampling without replacement from a finite population.\n\nIn this case, we have a population of 30 students, with 18 girls (success states) and 12 boys (failure states).\n\nWe're sampling 5 students without replacement, and we want exactly 3 girls.\n\nThe formula for the hypergeometric probability is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (30)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (18 girls)\n\n- n is the number of draws (5)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (3 girls)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = [C(18, 3) * C(12, 2)] / C(30, 5)\n\nWhich is exactly what we've calculated.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 272/721, or approximately 37.7%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{272}{721}} \\]"
