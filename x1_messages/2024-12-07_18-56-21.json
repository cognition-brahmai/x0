        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 10 black balls, 15 white balls, and 5 yellow balls. So in total, there are 10 + 15 + 5 = 30 balls in the box. The problem is asking for the probability that at least one ball is black when you pick two balls without replacement.\n\nOkay, first thing I need to understand is what \"at least one ball is black\" means. It means that either one ball is black, or both balls are black. So, I need to find the probability of either one or both balls being black.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the probability of each scenario separately and then add them up. So, probability of exactly one black ball plus the probability of both balls being black.\n\nBut there's another way to think about it, which might be simpler. Since it's \"at least one black ball,\" I can also calculate the probability of the opposite event, which is \"no black balls,\" and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least one black ball.\n\nLet me consider both approaches to see which one is easier.\n\nFirst approach: Probability of exactly one black ball plus probability of both black balls.\n\nTo find the probability of exactly one black ball, I need to consider that one ball is black and the other is not black. Also, since the order doesn't matter, I have to account for both possibilities: first ball black and second not black, or first ball not black and second black.\n\nSo, probability of first ball black and second not black is (10/30) * (20/29), because there are 10 black balls out of 30 initially, and then 20 non-black balls out of the remaining 29.\n\nSimilarly, probability of first ball not black and second black is (20/30) * (10/29).\n\nSo, total probability for exactly one black ball is (10/30)*(20/29) + (20/30)*(10/29).\n\nNow, probability of both balls being black is (10/30)*(9/29), since after picking one black ball, there are 9 left out of 29.\n\nSo, total probability of at least one black ball would be the sum of the above two probabilities.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, (10/30)*(20/29) = (1/3)*(20/29) = 20/87.\n\nSecond, (20/30)*(10/29) = (2/3)*(10/29) = 20/87.\n\nSo, total for exactly one black ball: 20/87 + 20/87 = 40/87.\n\nNow, probability of both balls being black: (10/30)*(9/29) = (1/3)*(9/29) = 9/87.\n\nSo, total probability of at least one black ball: 40/87 + 9/87 = 49/87.\n\nNow, let's consider the second approach: 1 minus the probability of no black balls.\n\nProbability of no black balls means both balls are not black.\n\nSo, probability of first ball not black is 20/30 = 2/3.\n\nThen, probability of second ball not black given the first was not black is 19/29.\n\nSo, probability of both balls not black is (20/30)*(19/29) = (2/3)*(19/29) = 38/87.\n\nTherefore, probability of at least one black ball is 1 - 38/87 = 49/87.\n\nOkay, both approaches give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one ball is black is 49/87.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{87}} \\]"
