        "content": "Green's theorem is a powerful tool that allows us to convert a line integral around a closed curve into a double integral over the region enclosed by that curve. It's particularly useful when the line integral is complicated or difficult to evaluate directly. Let's walk through an example to see how it works.\n\n### Example Problem\n\nSuppose we have a vector field \\(\\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (P(x, y), Q(x, y))\\), where \\(P(x, y) = y^2\\) and \\(Q(x, y) = x^2\\), and a closed curve \\(C\\) that is the boundary of the region \\(D\\), which is the unit disk \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\). We want to evaluate the line integral \\(\\oint_C P\\,dx + Q\\,dy\\) using Green's theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: State Green's Theorem\n\nGreen's theorem states that for a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed curve \\(C\\) and a plane region \\(D\\) bounded by \\(C\\), if \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have continuous partial derivatives on an open region containing \\(D\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\oint_C P\\,dx + Q\\,dy = \\iint_D \\left( \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} \\right) dA\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Compute the Partial Derivatives\n\nFirst, we need to compute the partial derivatives \\(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\).\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nP(x, y) = y^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad Q(x, y) = x^2\n\\]\n\nCompute \\(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2) = 2x\n\\]\n\nCompute \\(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2) = 2y\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Set Up the Double Integral\n\nUsing Green's theorem, the line integral becomes:\n\\[\n\\oint_C y^2\\,dx + x^2\\,dy = \\iint_D (2x - 2y)\\,dA = 2 \\iint_D (x - y)\\,dA\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Choose Coordinates for the Double Integral\n\nSince the region \\(D\\) is a disk centered at the origin with radius 1, it's convenient to use polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, \\(x = r \\cos \\theta\\), \\(y = r \\sin \\theta\\), and \\(dA = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the integrand:\n\\[\nx - y = r \\cos \\theta - r \\sin \\theta = r (\\cos \\theta - \\sin \\theta)\n\\]\n\nThus, the double integral becomes:\n\\[\n2 \\iint_D r (\\cos \\theta - \\sin \\theta) \\, r\\,dr\\,d\\theta = 2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^1 r^2 (\\cos \\theta - \\sin \\theta) \\, dr\\,d\\theta\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Evaluate the Double Integral\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to \\(r\\):\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 r^2 \\, dr = \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo the integral simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\cos \\theta - \\sin \\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{2}{3} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\cos \\theta - \\sin \\theta) \\, d\\theta\n\\]\n\nNow, integrate with respect to \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos \\theta \\, d\\theta = \\left[ \\sin \\theta \\right]_0^{2\\pi} = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin \\theta \\, d\\theta = \\left[ -\\cos \\theta \\right]_0^{2\\pi} = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} (0 - 0) = 0\n\\]\n\n#### Step 6: State the Final Answer\n\nThe value of the line integral is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGreen's theorem provides a straightforward method to evaluate line integrals by converting them into double integrals, which can often be easier to compute, especially when the region \\(D\\) has a simple shape like a disk. In this case, the integral evaluates to zero, which makes sense given the symmetry of the vector field and the region."
