        "content": "I'm here to help you with your Java program that connects to a PostgreSQL database and performs the specified tasks. Let's break down the problem into smaller steps and tackle each one at a time.\n\nFirst, we need to set up the connection to the PostgreSQL database. To do this, we'll need the JDBC driver for PostgreSQL. Make sure you have it included in your project's classpath. If you're using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>\n    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>\n    <version>42.2.18</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nNext, we'll need to establish a connection to the database. We'll use the `java.sql.DriverManager` class for this purpose. Here's a sample code snippet to connect to the database:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\n\npublic class DatabaseConnector {\n    public static Connection connect() throws SQLException {\n        String url = \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database\";\n        String user = \"your_username\";\n        String password = \"your_password\";\n        return DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `\"your_database\"`, `\"your_username\"`, and `\"your_password\"` with your actual database name, username, and password.\n\nNow, let's move on to creating the tables. We need a table to store information about employees, including their ID, name, salary, and department. We'll use the `java.sql.Statement` class to execute SQL commands.\n\nHere's the SQL command to create the `employees` table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\nIn Java, you can execute this command as follows:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.Statement;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\n\npublic class TableCreator {\n    public static void createEmployeesTable(Connection conn) throws SQLException {\n        String sql = \"CREATE TABLE employees (\" +\n                     \"id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\" +\n                     \"name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\" +\n                     \"salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\" +\n                     \"department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\" +\n                     \");\";\n        try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n            stmt.execute(sql);\n            System.out.println(\"Employees table created successfully.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, we need to insert sample data into the `employees` table. Let's prepare some sample data and insert it using the `java.sql.PreparedStatement` class for better performance and security.\n\nHere's an example of inserting a single employee:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.PreparedStatement;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\n\npublic class DataInserter {\n    public static void insertEmployee(Connection conn, String name, double salary, String department) throws SQLException {\n        String sql = \"INSERT INTO employees (name, salary, department) VALUES (?, ?, ?);\";\n        try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n            pstmt.setString(1, name);\n            pstmt.setDouble(2, salary);\n            pstmt.setString(3, department);\n            pstmt.executeUpdate();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can call this method multiple times with different data to insert multiple employees.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\nDataInserter.insertEmployee(conn, \"John Doe\", 50000.00, \"HR\");\nDataInserter.insertEmployee(conn, \"Jane Smith\", 60000.00, \"Engineering\");\nDataInserter.insertEmployee(conn, \"Mike Johnson\", 55000.00, \"HR\");\n// Add more employees as needed\n```\n\nNow, the most complex part is retrieving the top 5 highest paid employees from each department. To achieve this, we'll use a SQL query with window functions, specifically the `ROW_NUMBER()` function, which assigns a unique row number to each row within a partition of a result set.\n\nHere's the SQL query to accomplish this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT department, name, salary\nFROM (\n    SELECT department, name, salary,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn\n    FROM employees\n) sub\nWHERE rn <= 5;\n```\n\nIn this query, we're partitioning the data by department and ordering each partition by salary in descending order. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique row number to each employee within their department based on their salary. Finally, we select only those rows where the row number is less than or equal to 5, which gives us the top 5 highest paid employees in each department.\n\nIn Java, you can execute this query and process the results as follows:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.ResultSet;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.sql.Statement;\n\npublic class TopEmployeesRetriever {\n    public static void getTopEmployees(Connection conn) throws SQLException {\n        String sql = \"SELECT department, name, salary \" +\n                     \"FROM (\" +\n                     \"    SELECT department, name, salary,\" +\n                     \"           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn\" +\n                     \"    FROM employees\" +\n                     \") sub \" +\n                     \"WHERE rn <= 5;\";\n        try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n             ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql)) {\n            while (rs.next()) {\n                String department = rs.getString(\"department\");\n                String name = rs.getString(\"name\");\n                double salary = rs.getDouble(\"salary\");\n                System.out.println(\"Department: \" + department + \", Name: \" + name + \", Salary: \" + salary);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, let's put all these pieces together in a main class to execute the entire program:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Connection conn = null;\n        try {\n            conn = DatabaseConnector.connect();\n            TableCreator.createEmployeesTable(conn);\n            DataInserter.insertEmployee(conn, \"John Doe\", 50000.00, \"HR\");\n            DataInserter.insertEmployee(conn, \"Jane Smith\", 60000.00, \"Engineering\");\n            DataInserter.insertEmployee(conn, \"Mike Johnson\", 55000.00, \"HR\");\n            // Insert more employees as needed\n            TopEmployeesRetriever.getTopEmployees(conn);\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            System.err.println(e.getMessage());\n        } finally {\n            try {\n                if (conn != null) {\n                    conn.close();\n                }\n            } catch (SQLException ex) {\n                System.err.println(ex.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program will connect to your PostgreSQL database, create the `employees` table, insert sample data, and retrieve the top 5 highest paid employees from each department.\n\nRemember to handle exceptions properly and close database resources to avoid leaks. Also, ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible with the provided connection parameters.\n\nI hope this helps you complete your task!
