The question is asking for the ratio of boys to girls, and to simplify it, and also to explain how I got there.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, in this case, I'm comparing the number of boys to the number of girls. So, the ratio of boys to girls is 18 to 12.\n\nNow, ratios can be written in different ways: like 18:12, or as a fraction 18/12. I think writing it as a fraction might make it easier to simplify.\n\nSo, 18/12. To simplify this fraction, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 12 and then divide both the numerator and the denominator by that number.\n\nLet's see, the factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, and the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. So, the greatest common divisor is 6.\n\nNow, dividing both numerator and denominator by 6: 18 \u00f7 6 = 3, and 12 \u00f7 6 = 2. So, the simplified fraction is 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio of boys to girls is 3:2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 18 boys and 12 girls, and I've simplified that to 3:2, does that make sense? Well, 3:2 means that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. Let's see if that holds up.\n\nIf I divide the number of boys by 3, I get 18 \u00f7 3 = 6, and the number of girls by 2, which is 12 \u00f7 2 = 6. So, both give me 6, which means the ratio is indeed 3:2.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if multiplying 3 and 2 by the same number gives me 18 and 12. So, 3 \u00d7 6 = 18, and 2 \u00d7 6 = 12. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's a smaller ratio possible. Is there a number smaller than 6 that divides both 18 and 12?\n\nWell, 3 divides both 18 and 12: 18 \u00f7 3 = 6, 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, which gives me 6:4. But 6:4 can be simplified further by dividing both by 2, which brings me back to 3:2.\n\nSimilarly, 2 divides both 18 and 12: 18 \u00f7 2 = 9, 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, which is 9:6, and that can be simplified by dividing both by 3 to get 3:2 again.\n\nAnd 1 divides both, but that would just give 18:12, which again simplifies to 3:2.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the simplest form of the ratio is 3:2.\n\nI think that's the answer. But the question also asks to explain the reasoning. So, let me try to put it in words.\n\nWe have a class with 18 boys and 12 girls. To find the ratio of boys to girls, we compare the number of boys to the number of girls using division. So, the ratio is 18 to 12, which can be written as 18:12 or as a fraction 18/12.\n\nTo simplify this ratio, we need to reduce the fraction to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 18 and 12 is 6.\n\nDividing both 18 and 12 by 6, we get 3 and 2, respectively. Therefore, the simplified ratio is 3:2.\n\nThis means that for every 3 boys in the class, there are 2 girls.\n\nI think that adequately explains the reasoning behind the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:2} \\]"
