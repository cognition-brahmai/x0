        "content": "So I've got this problem here about finding the surface area of a rectangular box. The dimensions are given: length is 6 inches, width is 4 inches, and height is 3 inches. I need to find out what the surface area is.\n\nFirst off, I remember that a rectangular box has six faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right. To find the total surface area, I need to find the area of each of these faces and then add them all together.\n\nLet me think about the areas of these faces:\n\n1. **Top and Bottom:** These two faces are identical. The area of each should be length times width. So, that's 6 inches times 4 inches, which is 24 square inches each. Since there are two of them, that's a total of 48 square inches.\n\n2. **Front and Back:** These two faces are also identical. The area of each should be height times length. Wait, no! Actually, the front and back faces are height times width. So, that's 3 inches times 4 inches, which is 12 square inches each. For both, that's 24 square inches.\n\n3. **Left and Right:** These two faces are identical as well. The area of each should be height times length. So, that's 3 inches times 6 inches, which is 18 square inches each. For both, that's 36 square inches.\n\nNow, I'll add up all these areas: 48 square inches (top and bottom) plus 24 square inches (front and back) plus 36 square inches (left and right). That totals up to 108 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, is there a formula for this? I think there is a standard formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism. Let me recall it.\n\nThe formula should be: Surface Area = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l is length, w is width, and h is height.\n\nPlugging in the values: 2*(6*4) + 2*(6*3) + 2*(4*3) = 2*(24) + 2*(18) + 2*(12) = 48 + 36 + 24 = 108 square inches.\n\nOkay, that matches what I calculated earlier by finding each pair of faces separately.\n\nIs there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe by visualizing the net of the rectangular box.\n\nIf I unfold the box, it would consist of:\n\n- One large rectangle of dimensions length by width (6 inches by 4 inches).\n\n- Two rectangles of height by width (3 inches by 4 inches).\n\n- Two rectangles of height by length (3 inches by 6 inches).\n\nWait, no, in the net, there would be:\n\n- Two length by width rectangles (top and bottom).\n\n- Two height by width rectangles (front and back).\n\n- Two height by length rectangles (left and right).\n\nYes, same as before. So, areas would be:\n\n- Two of 6*4 = 24 each, total 48.\n\n- Two of 3*4 = 12 each, total 24.\n\n- Two of 3*6 = 18 each, total 36.\n\nTotal surface area: 48 + 24 + 36 = 108 square inches.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for surface area of a rectangular prism, which is indeed 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, leading to the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. Surface area is 108 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]"
