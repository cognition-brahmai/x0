        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Let's classify each of these bread types as either leavened or unleavened.\n\n1. **Sourdough**: This is a leavened bread. Sourdough uses a natural leavening agent made from fermented flour and water, which contains wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. This fermentation process causes the dough to rise, giving it its characteristic texture and flavor.\n\n2. **Pita**: Pita is also a leavened bread. It's made using yeast as a leavening agent, which helps the dough rise. When baked at high temperatures, the moist dough causes the bread to puff up, creating the pocket that is characteristic of pita bread.\n\n3. **Baguette**: A baguette is a leavened bread. It's a type of French bread that is known for its long, thin shape and crisp crust. Yeast is used to leaven the dough, which is then shaped and baked to achieve its distinctive characteristics.\n\n4. **Tortilla**: Tortillas can be either leavened or unleavened, but traditionally, they are unleavened. Classic corn tortillas, for example, are made from masa harina (a type of corn flour) and water, without any leavening agents. However, some wheat tortillas may include yeast or other leavening agents to make them lighter and fluffier.\n\n5. **Naan**: Naan is a leavened bread. It's a type of flatbread that originates from South Asia. Naan dough typically includes yeast or baking powder as a leavening agent, which helps it rise and gives it a soft, slightly puffy texture when baked in a tandoor oven.\n\n6. **Ciabatta**: Ciabatta is a leavened bread. It's an Italian bread known for its airy texture and crisp crust. Ciabatta dough is usually made with yeast, and it's known for its long fermentation period, which contributes to its complex flavor and open crumb structure.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- Leavened: sourdough, pita, baguette, naan, ciabatta\n- Unleavened: tortilla (traditionally)\n\nI hope that helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n"
