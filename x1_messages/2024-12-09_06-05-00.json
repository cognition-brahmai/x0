        "content": "Alright, I'll guide you through writing a Java program that interacts with AWS S3 to create a bucket, upload a file, and list all files in the bucket. Make sure you have the AWS SDK for Java set up in your project. If you're using Maven, you'll need to include the AWS SDK dependencies in your `pom.xml`.\n\nFirst, you need to set up your AWS credentials. The easiest way is to have them in the `~/.aws/credentials` file or set them as environment variables.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Add AWS SDK Dependency:**\n\n   If you're using Maven, add this to your `pom.xml`:\n\n   ```xml\n   <dependency>\n       <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>\n       <artifactId>s3</artifactId>\n       <version>2.17.96</version>\n   </dependency>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create the Java Program:**\n\n   Here's a sample program that does what you're asking for:\n\n   ```java\n   import software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region;\n   import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3Client;\n   import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.model.*;\n\n   import java.io.File;\n   import java.io.IOException;\n   import java.util.List;\n\n   public class S3Example {\n\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           // Replace with your AWS region\n           Region region = Region.US_WEST_2;\n           S3Client s3 = S3Client.builder().region(region).build();\n\n           // Replace with your bucket name\n           String bucketName = \"your-unique-bucket-name\";\n\n           // Create a new bucket\n           createBucket(s3, bucketName);\n\n           // Upload a file to the bucket\n           String filePath = \"/path/to/your/local/file.txt\";\n           String keyName = \"file.txt\";\n           uploadFile(s3, bucketName, filePath, keyName);\n\n           // List all files in the bucket\n           listObjects(s3, bucketName);\n\n           s3.close();\n       }\n\n       private static void createBucket(S3Client s3, String bucketName) {\n           CreateBucketRequest request = CreateBucketRequest.builder()\n                   .bucket(bucketName)\n                   .createBucketConfiguration(\n                           CreateBucketConfiguration.builder()\n                                   .locationConstraint(s3.region())\n                                   .build())\n                   .build();\n\n           try {\n               s3.createBucket(request);\n               System.out.println(\"Bucket created: \" + bucketName);\n           } catch (BucketAlreadyExistsException e) {\n               System.err.println(\"Bucket already exists. Please choose a different name.\");\n           } catch (BucketAlreadyOwnedByYouException e) {\n               System.err.println(\"You already own this bucket. Please choose a different name.\");\n           } catch (SdkException e) {\n               System.err.println(\"Error creating bucket: \" + e.getMessage());\n           }\n       }\n\n       private static void uploadFile(S3Client s3, String bucketName, String filePath, String keyName) {\n           File file = new File(filePath);\n           try {\n               PutObjectRequest request = PutObjectRequest.builder()\n                       .bucket(bucketName)\n                       .key(keyName)\n                       .build();\n               s3.putObject(request,RequestBody.fromFile(file));\n               System.out.println(\"File uploaded: \" + keyName);\n           } catch (SdkException e) {\n               System.err.println(\"Error uploading file: \" + e.getMessage());\n           }\n       }\n\n       private static void listObjects(S3Client s3, String bucketName) {\n           try {\n               ListObjectsV2Request request = ListObjectsV2Request.builder()\n                       .bucket(bucketName)\n                       .build();\n\n               ListObjectsV2Response response = s3.listObjectsV2(request);\n               List<S3Object> objects = response.contents();\n               if (objects != null) {\n                   for (S3Object object : objects) {\n                       System.out.println(\" - \" + object.key());\n                   }\n               } else {\n                   System.out.println(\"No objects found in bucket: \" + bucketName);\n               }\n           } catch (SdkException e) {\n               System.err.println(\"Error listing objects: \" + e.getMessage());\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Replace placeholders:**\n\n   - Replace `\"your-unique-bucket-name\"` with a unique name for your S3 bucket.\n   - Replace `\"/path/to/your/local/file.txt\"` with the path to the file you want to upload.\n   - Set the `Region` to the appropriate AWS region where you want to create the bucket.\n\n4. **Run the Program:**\n\n   Compile and run your Java program. It should create the bucket, upload the specified file, and list all files in the bucket.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- Ensure that your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to perform S3 operations (create bucket, put object, list objects).\n- Bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts, so choose a unique name.\n- Be cautious with AWS costs. Buckets and stored objects incur charges based on AWS pricing.\n\nThis should get you started with basic S3 operations using the AWS SDK for Java.
