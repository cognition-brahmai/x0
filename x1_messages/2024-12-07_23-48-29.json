        "content": "So, the company has 200 employees, and they're planning to give everyone a 10% raise. The current average salary is $50,000 per year. We need to find out how much the total payroll will increase.\n\nFirst, let's understand what payroll is. Payroll is the total amount of money a company pays to its employees for their work. So, if the average salary is $50,000 and there are 200 employees, the total current payroll would be 200 times $50,000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 200 * 50,000 = $10,000,000. So, the current total payroll is $10,000,000.\n\nNow, each employee is getting a 10% raise. That means each employee's salary will increase by 10% of their current salary.\n\nSince the average salary is $50,000, the average raise per employee would be 10% of $50,000.\n\nLet's calculate that: 10% of 50,000 is 0.10 * 50,000 = $5,000.\n\nSo, each employee is getting an average raise of $5,000.\n\nNow, to find the total increase in payroll, we need to multiply the average raise per employee by the number of employees.\n\nThat would be 200 employees * $5,000 = $1,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the total payroll will increase by $1,000,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that a 10% raise across the board means the total payroll will also increase by 10%.\n\nSo, 10% of the current payroll of $10,000,000 is 0.10 * 10,000,000 = $1,000,000.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total payroll will increase by $1,000,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose the salaries are not all exactly $50,000. Maybe some are higher and some are lower, but the average is $50,000.\n\nWhen you give a 10% raise to each employee, are there any complications because of the variation in salaries?\n\nWell, no, because the raise is a percentage of each employee's salary, and the average salary is $50,000, so the average raise is $5,000, and multiplying by the number of employees still gives $1,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, since the raise is a percentage, the total raise should be equal to the percentage increase times the total payroll, which is again 10% of $10,000,000, which is $1,000,000.\n\nSo, regardless of how the salaries are distributed, as long as the average salary is $50,000, the total raise will be $1,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the total payroll will increase by $1,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000000} \\]"
