        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that travels at 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours to reach its destination without any stops. But in this scenario, the train stops for 15 minutes every hour. We need to find out the total time it actually takes for the train to reach its destination including these stops.\n\nFirst, let's understand the basic travel time without stops. The train travels at 60 miles per hour and takes 2 hours to reach the destination. So, the distance to the destination is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, the train stops for 15 minutes every hour. Since the total travel time without stops is 2 hours, we need to determine how many stops the train makes during this time.\n\nIf the train stops every hour, then in 2 hours, it would stop twice, once after each hour of travel.\n\nEach stop is 15 minutes long. So, the total time spent stopping is:\n\nTotal stop time = Number of stops \u00d7 Duration per stop = 2 \u00d7 15 minutes = 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the actual time taken to reach the destination, including stops, would be the travel time plus the stop time:\n\nActual time = Travel time + Stop time = 2 hours + 30 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about this again. Does the train stop after every hour of travel, or is there a stop at the end of the journey? For example, does the train stop after the first hour and then again after the second hour, or is there only one stop in between?\n\nThe problem says the train stops for 15 minutes every hour. This suggests that every full hour of travel, the train stops for 15 minutes. So, in a 2-hour journey, there would be stops after the first hour and after the second hour.\n\nBut, if the train stops after the second hour, that would be right before it reaches the destination. So, perhaps the last stop doesn't occur if the train has already reached its destination.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"the train stops for 15 minutes every hour.\" It doesn't specify whether the stop is at the end of each hour of travel or every full hour mark. This could be ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stops are scheduled at the end of each hour of travel, meaning after every hour spent traveling.\n\nGiven that, in a 2-hour journey, there would be stops after the first hour and after the second hour.\n\nBut, if the train reaches its destination before the next stop is due, perhaps no stop is made at the end.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Perhaps it's better to calculate the number of stops based on the total travel time.\n\nIf the train travels for 2 hours without stops, but stops every hour, then in 2 hours, it would stop twice, once after each hour.\n\nAlternatively, if the stops are every full hour, starting from the first hour, then in 2 hours, there would be two stops.\n\nBut, perhaps the first stop occurs after the first hour of travel, and the second stop after the second hour.\n\nHowever, if the train reaches its destination right at the end of the second hour, maybe the second stop doesn't occur.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the stops as occurring at the end of each hour of travel, but not beyond the total travel time.\n\nGiven that, in a 2-hour journey, there would be stops after the first hour and after the second hour.\n\nTherefore, two stops of 15 minutes each, totaling 30 minutes.\n\nAdding this to the original 2 hours of travel time gives a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut, perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe the train travels for an hour, stops for 15 minutes, then travels another hour, and stops again for 15 minutes.\n\nSo, the sequence would be:\n\n- Travel 1 hour\n\n- Stop 15 minutes\n\n- Travel another hour\n\n- Stop 15 minutes\n\nTotal time: 1 hour + 15 minutes + 1 hour + 15 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nHowever, perhaps the last stop isn't necessary if the train has already reached its destination. In that case, after the second hour of travel, the train arrives at the destination, and no stop is needed.\n\nBut the problem says \"the train stops for 15 minutes every hour.\" This seems to imply that the stops occur regularly every hour during the journey.\n\nGiven that, if the journey is exactly 2 hours, then there would be stops after the first hour and after the second hour.\n\nTherefore, two stops in total.\n\nThus, the total time is 2 hours of travel plus 30 minutes of stops, equaling 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stops occur during the travel time, effectively reducing the traveling time.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because stops are additional time added to the travel time, not subtracted.\n\nWait, no. Stops are times when the train is not moving, so they should be added to the total travel time.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that the train's overall journey time includes both moving and stopped time.\n\nIn other words, the \"travel time\" is the time spent moving, and the \"stop time\" is additional time when the train is not moving.\n\nTherefore, the total actual time is the sum of travel time and stop time.\n\nGiven that, in our earlier calculation, 2 hours of travel plus 30 minutes of stops equals 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nLet's consider the speed of the train. It travels at 60 miles per hour, and the distance is 120 miles, as calculated earlier.\n\nWithout stops, it takes 2 hours to cover 120 miles.\n\nBut with stops, the train spends less time moving because it's stopped for some time.\n\nWait, but in reality, when a train stops, it's not moving during that time, so the total time to cover the distance increases because part of the time is spent stopped.\n\nWait, no. If the train stops for 15 minutes every hour, that means that for every hour of travel, there is an additional 15 minutes of stop time.\n\nSo, for 2 hours of travel, there would be 30 minutes of stop time, making the total time 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut let's think about it in terms of effective travel time.\n\nIf the train travels for 1 hour, then stops for 15 minutes, then travels another hour, and stops again for 15 minutes, the sequence is:\n\n- Travel 1 hour: covers 60 miles, time elapsed 1 hour\n\n- Stop 15 minutes: time elapsed 1 hour and 15 minutes\n\n- Travel another hour: covers another 60 miles, time elapsed 2 hours plus the previous 1 hour and 15 minutes, totaling 2 hours and 15 minutes\n\n- Stop 15 minutes: time elapsed 2 hours and 30 minutes\n\nSo, the total time is 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if the train travels for 1 hour, stops for 15 minutes, then travels another 55 minutes to cover the remaining distance, since it's traveling at 60 miles per hour.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate.\n\nLet me recast this.\n\nIf the train stops for 15 minutes every hour, then the effective travel time increases because of the stops.\n\nSo, the train is moving for less than the total time due to the stops.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the total time based on the distance and the effective speed, considering the stops.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, the train travels at 60 miles per hour, and stops for 15 minutes every hour.\n\nSo, in a 60-minute hour, the train is moving for 45 minutes and stopped for 15 minutes.\n\nWait, no. If it stops for 15 minutes every hour, then in each hour of travel time, there is an additional 15 minutes of stop time.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the train's moving time and the stop time separately.\n\nThe train moves at 60 miles per hour, and for every hour of moving, it stops for 15 minutes.\n\nSo, for each hour of moving, the total time is 1 hour plus 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, for 2 hours of moving, the total time is 2 hours plus 2 \u00d7 15 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nThis aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stops are not exactly every hour of moving, but every full hour of the clock.\n\nFor example, if the train starts at time zero, after 1 hour, it stops for 15 minutes, then continues moving, and after another hour of moving, stops again for 15 minutes.\n\nBut this seems similar to the previous approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stops are based on the clock time, not the moving time.\n\nBut that might complicate things further.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the simplest and most straightforward approach is to consider that for each hour of moving, there is an additional 15 minutes of stop time.\n\nTherefore, for 2 hours of moving, the stop time is 2 \u00d7 15 minutes = 30 minutes.\n\nThus, the total time is 2 hours of moving plus 30 minutes of stops, equaling 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut to ensure this is correct, let's consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose the train travels for 1 hour, covers 60 miles, then stops for 15 minutes.\n\nThen, it travels another hour, covers another 60 miles, and stops for another 15 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 1 hour (travel) + 15 minutes (stop) + 1 hour (travel) + 15 minutes (stop) = 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if the train reaches its destination before the next stop is due, we might need to adjust the stop time.\n\nBut in this case, since the journey is exactly 2 hours of moving, with stops after each hour, the total time remains 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the actual time taken for the train to reach its destination, including stops, is 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours and } 30 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
