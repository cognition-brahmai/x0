        "content": "So there's this box with 12 apples and 8 oranges, right? So in total, there are 12 plus 8, which is 20 fruits in the box.\n\nNow, the first question is: if you pick a fruit randomly without looking, what's the probability that it's an apple?\n\nWell, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking an apple, and there are 12 apples. The total number of fruits is 20. So, the probability should be 12 divided by 20. Let's see, that simplifies to 3/5, or 0.6, which is 60%. So, there's a 60% chance that you'll pick an apple first.\n\nOkay, now the second part: after picking one apple, what's the probability that the next fruit you pick is also an apple?\n\nHmm, so if you've already picked one apple, that means there are now 11 apples left and still 8 oranges, because you only picked an apple. So, the total number of fruits now is 11 plus 8, which is 19.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another apple is 11 divided by 19. Let's calculate that. 11 divided by 19 is approximately 0.5789, which is about 57.89%.\n\nSo, the probability decreases slightly from 60% to about 57.89% after picking one apple.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Yes, because you've removed one apple, so there are fewer apples left in the box, which should make the probability slightly lower for picking another apple.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about it in terms of combinations. The probability of picking two apples in a row without replacement.\n\nThe first pick: 12 apples out of 20 fruits, which is 12/20.\n\nThe second pick: 11 apples out of the remaining 19 fruits, which is 11/19.\n\nSo, the combined probability would be (12/20) times (11/19).\n\nLet's calculate that: (12/20) * (11/19) = (3/5) * (11/19) = 33/95.\n\n33 divided by 95 is approximately 0.347, or 34.7%.\n\nBut wait, that seems different from what I thought earlier. Let me see.\n\nOh, I think I'm confusing two different things here. The first part was the probability of the first pick being an apple, which is 12/20 or 60%.\n\nThe second part is the probability of the second pick being an apple given that the first pick was an apple.\n\nSo, it's a conditional probability.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nIn this case, P(first apple and second apple) = P(first apple) * P(second apple | first apple was an apple).\n\nWe already have P(first apple) = 12/20 = 3/5.\n\nP(second apple | first apple) = 11/19.\n\nSo, P(two apples in a row) = (3/5) * (11/19) = 33/95, which is about 34.7%.\n\nBut the question was: after picking one apple, what is the probability that the next fruit picked will also be an apple?\n\nSo, it's asking for P(second apple | first apple), which is 11/19, or about 57.89%.\n\nI think I was getting confused between the combined probability and the conditional probability.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- The probability of picking an apple first is 12/20 = 60%.\n\n- Given that the first pick was an apple, the probability that the second pick is also an apple is 11/19, which is about 57.89%.\n\n- The probability of both picks being apples is (12/20) * (11/19) = 33/95, or about 34.7%.\n\nBut the question specifically asked for the probability that the next fruit picked will also be an apple after picking one apple, which is the conditional probability, so 11/19.\n\nAlright, that makes sense now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe probability that the next fruit picked will also be an apple after picking one apple is \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{19}}."
