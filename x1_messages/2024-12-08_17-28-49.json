Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mixture of both.\n\nTools available:\nNetSearch[input]: Allows the user to search for information online. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may or may not contain the answer to the user's question.\nPageLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkGrabber[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Language model for answering questions, especially effective when answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who founded SpaceX and what were their motivations?"
