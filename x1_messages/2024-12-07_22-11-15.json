        "content": "So there are 10 people in a room, including Alex and Beth. If half of the people leave the room, how many people remain?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. There are 10 people in total. Half of them leave. So, half of 10 is 5. Therefore, 5 people leave the room.\n\nNow, to find out how many people remain, we subtract the number of people who left from the total number of people initially in the room.\n\nThat is:\n\n10 (initial number of people) - 5 (number of people who left) = 5 people remain.\n\nSo, 5 people remain in the room.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this again. The question says \"including Alex and Beth.\" Does that mean that Alex and Beth are part of the 10 people, which we already accounted for.\n\nYes, they are included in the 10 people. So, when we say 5 people leave, it could be any 5 people from the 10, including or excluding Alex and Beth.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify who leaves, just that half of the people leave.\n\nSo, regardless of who leaves, the calculation remains the same: half of 10 is 5, so 5 people leave, and 5 remain.\n\nUnless, perhaps, there's some trick here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the \"including Alex and Beth\" is just to set the scene and doesn't affect the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that Alex and Beth are special and perhaps they don't leave, but that's not suggested by the wording.\n\nThe statement is straightforward: half of the people leave the room.\n\nSo, again, half of 10 is 5, so 5 people leave, and 5 remain.\n\nI think the answer is 5 people remain.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if the number of people remaining could be different.\n\nSuppose Alex and Beth are two of the people who leave. Then, 5 people leave, including Alex and Beth, and 5 remain, excluding them.\n\nAlternatively, if Alex and Beth stay, then they are among the 5 who remain.\n\nOr, any combination where any 5 people leave.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify who stays or leaves, just that half leave.\n\nTherefore, the number of people remaining is 5.\n\nSo, the final answer is [ 5 ] people remain in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
