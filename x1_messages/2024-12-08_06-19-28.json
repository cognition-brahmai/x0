        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a car that's driving at two different speeds for different amounts of time, and we need to find out the total distance it travels.\n\nFirst, the car drives at an average speed of 50 miles per hour (mph) for 6 hours. To find out how far it goes in that time, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 50 mph \u00d7 6 hours\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n50 \u00d7 6 = 300 miles\n\nOkay, so the car travels 300 miles during the first 6 hours.\n\nNext, the car slows down to 30 mph for another 4 hours. Again, we use the same formula to find the distance for this part:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 30 mph \u00d7 4 hours\n\nCalculating that:\n\n30 \u00d7 4 = 120 miles\n\nSo, in the next 4 hours, the car travels 120 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, we just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082\n\nThat is:\n\nTotal Distance = 300 miles + 120 miles = 420 miles\n\nTherefore, the car travels a total of 420 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. The first part: 50 mph for 6 hours is indeed 300 miles. The second part: 30 mph for 4 hours is 120 miles. Adding them up gives 420 miles. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think about average speed over the entire journey, but in this case, since the speeds are different for different time intervals, we don't need to calculate the overall average speed. Just summing up the distances from each part should give us the total distance.\n\nI think that's the correct approach and answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{420} \\]"
