        "content": "Let's see. So, the car goes from Town A to Town B, which is 120 miles away, and it takes 2 hours to get there. First, I need to find out the speed of the car on the way to Town B.\n\nI know that speed is equal to distance divided by time, right? So, if the distance is 120 miles and the time is 2 hours, then the speed should be 120 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, on the way back from Town B to Town A, the car's speed is increased by 10 mph. So, if the original speed was 60 mph, then the new speed is 60 plus 10, which is 70 mph.\n\nI need to find out how long it takes to travel back to Town A at this new speed. Again, time is equal to distance divided by speed. The distance is still 120 miles, and the speed is now 70 mph.\n\nSo, time equals 120 miles divided by 70 mph. Let me calculate that: 120 divided by 70 is approximately 1.714 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it as a fraction for more precision. 120 divided by 70 is the same as 12/7 hours. To convert that to hours and minutes, I can see how many whole hours there are and then convert the decimal part to minutes.\n\n12/7 hours is 1 hour plus 5/7 of an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 5/7 of an hour is (5/7)*60 minutes, which is about 42.857 minutes.\n\nSo, the time it takes to travel back is approximately 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the speed to Town B: distance is 120 miles, time is 2 hours, so speed is indeed 60 mph.\n\nThen, the return speed is 60 mph plus 10 mph, which is 70 mph.\n\nTime to travel back: distance 120 miles divided by speed 70 mph, which is 12/7 hours, which is approximately 1.714 hours.\n\nConverting 0.714 hours to minutes: 0.714 * 60 \u2248 42.857 minutes, so roughly 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula time = distance / speed, keep it in fractions to avoid decimals.\n\nTime = 120 / 70 = 12/7 hours, which is 1 hour and 5/7 of an hour.\n\n5/7 of an hour in minutes is (5/7)*60 = 300/7 \u2248 42.857 minutes, so indeed, about 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour and } 43 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
