        "content": "To find out how many times you'd have to travel around the Earth to cover a distance equal to the average distance between the Earth and the Moon, you can divide the distance to the Moon by the circumference of the Earth.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nNumber of trips around Earth = Distance to Moon / Circumference of Earth\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of trips around Earth = 238,900 miles / 24,901 miles\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\nNumber of trips around Earth \u2248 9.59\n\nSo, you would have to travel around the Earth approximately 9.59 times to cover a distance equal to the average distance between the Earth and the Moon.\n\nTo make it more understandable, you could say about 9.6 times or roughly 10 times around the Earth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9.59} \\]"
