        "content": "So, let's see here. The car travels at two different speeds for different amounts of time, and we need to find out the total distance it has traveled. I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time, so maybe I can calculate the distance for each part of the trip separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, the car travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, the distance for this part should be 60 miles per hour times 3 hours, which is 180 miles.\n\nThen, it travels at 45 miles per hour for another 2 hours. So, the distance for this part is 45 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 90 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together: 180 miles plus 90 miles equals 270 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the average speed for the entire trip and then multiplying by the total time?\n\nLet's try that. The total time traveled is 3 hours plus 2 hours, which is 5 hours.\n\nNow, to find the average speed for the entire trip, I would need to divide the total distance by the total time. But in this case, I don't know the total distance yet, which is what I'm trying to find. So, maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use weighted averages for the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, the average speed would be (60 mph * 3 hours + 45 mph * 2 hours) divided by the total time, which is 5 hours.\n\nLet's calculate that: (60 * 3) is 180, (45 * 2) is 90, so 180 plus 90 is 270. Then, 270 divided by 5 is 54 mph.\n\nSo, the average speed is 54 mph, and since the total time is 5 hours, the total distance would be 54 mph * 5 hours, which is also 270 miles.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the total distance the car has traveled is 270 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
