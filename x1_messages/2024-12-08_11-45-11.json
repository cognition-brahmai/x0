        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of friends who planned to share a $90 meal equally. If one more friend joins, everyone pays $2 less. We need to find out how many friends were originally planning to eat.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being asked. We have an original number of friends, say \\( n \\), who are going to split $90 equally. So, each person's share is \\( \\frac{90}{n} \\).\n\nNow, if one more friend joins, the number of friends becomes \\( n + 1 \\), and each person's share becomes \\( \\frac{90}{n + 1} \\). According to the problem, this new share is $2 less than the original share. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{n} - \\frac{90}{n + 1} = 2 \\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( n \\).\n\nAlright, let's try to solve this equation. First, I'll find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The common denominator of \\( n \\) and \\( n + 1 \\) is \\( n(n + 1) \\). So, let's rewrite the equation with this common denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90(n + 1) - 90n}{n(n + 1)} = 2 \\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[ 90(n + 1) - 90n = 90n + 90 - 90n = 90 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{n(n + 1)} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, cross-multiplying to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ 90 = 2n(n + 1) \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to simplify:\n\n\\[ 45 = n(n + 1) \\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ n^2 + n - 45 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for \\( n \\). I can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -45 \\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 180}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{181}}{2} \\]\n\nHmm, \\( \\sqrt{181} \\) is not a perfect square. It's approximately 13.453. So,\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-1 + 13.453}{2} \\approx \\frac{12.453}{2} \\approx 6.2265 \\]\n\nOr\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-1 - 13.453}{2} \\approx \\frac{-14.453}{2} \\approx -7.2265 \\]\n\nBut the number of friends can't be negative or a fraction. So, this approach doesn't seem to be giving us a whole number solution, which is what we need since the number of friends has to be a whole number.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me think differently. Let's assume there are \\( n \\) friends originally. Each pays \\( \\frac{90}{n} \\). If one more friend joins, making it \\( n + 1 \\) friends, each pays \\( \\frac{90}{n + 1} \\), and this is $2 less than the original share.\n\nSo, the equation should be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{n} - \\frac{90}{n + 1} = 2 \\]\n\nI think I set it up correctly. But maybe I should try plugging in some whole number values for \\( n \\) and see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{5} - \\frac{90}{6} = 18 - 15 = 3 \\]\n\nBut the difference should be $2, not $3. So, not correct.\n\nTry \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{6} - \\frac{90}{7} = 15 - 12.857 \\approx 2.143 \\]\n\nClose but not exactly $2.\n\nTry \\( n = 9 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{9} - \\frac{90}{10} = 10 - 9 = 1 \\]\n\nToo low.\n\nHmm, maybe \\( n = 8 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{8} - \\frac{90}{9} = 11.25 - 10 = 1.25 \\]\n\nStill not $2.\n\nOkay, maybe I need to be more systematic. Let's try \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{10} - \\frac{90}{11} = 9 - 8.181 \\approx 0.819 \\]\n\nToo low.\n\nLooks like \\( n = 6 \\) gave a difference of about $2.143, which is close but not exact. Maybe there's no integer solution, but that seems unlikely for a word problem.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider that the difference is exactly $2. Maybe the initial approach of setting up the equation is correct, and the solution isn't an integer. But that doesn't make sense for the number of friends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the problem allows for fractional shares, but that also doesn't make sense in reality. Perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the total cost and how it's divided. Original share per person: \\( \\frac{90}{n} \\). New share: \\( \\frac{90}{n + 1} \\). The difference is $2.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{90}{n} - \\frac{90}{n + 1} = 2 \\). I can multiply both sides by \\( n(n + 1) \\) to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[ 90(n + 1) - 90n = 2n(n + 1) \\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[ 90n + 90 - 90n = 90 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 90 = 2n(n + 1) \\), which simplifies to:\n\n\\[ n^2 + n - 45 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is the same quadratic equation I had before. Solving it gives non-integer solutions, which doesn't make sense for the number of friends.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number. If \\( n \\approx 6.2265 \\), then perhaps the original number of friends is 6.\n\nLet me check with \\( n = 6 \\):\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{90}{6} = 15 \\) dollars.\n\nWith one more friend: \\( \\frac{90}{7} \\approx 12.857 \\) dollars.\n\nDifference: \\( 15 - 12.857 \\approx 2.143 \\) dollars, which is approximately $2.\n\nMaybe the problem expects us to accept this approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or my interpretation. Maybe the total cost isn't exactly $90, or perhaps there's a typo.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider that the difference is exactly $2, and see if that leads to an integer solution.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{90}{n} - \\frac{90}{n + 1} = 2 \\).\n\nAs before, this leads to \\( n^2 + n - 45 = 0 \\), with no integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference is exactly $2, but that's not resulting in an integer \\( n \\). Perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the number of friends must be an integer, and choose the closest integer value.\n\nGiven that \\( n \\approx 6.2265 \\), and \\( n = 6 \\) gives a difference of about $2.143, which is close to $2, maybe that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem should have a total cost that leads to integer solutions. Maybe it's a hypothetical scenario to practice setting up and solving equations, even if the solution isn't an integer.\n\nIn real life, the number of friends has to be an integer, so perhaps the problem is designed to illustrate that not all mathematical solutions correspond to real-world possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the $2 less is per person's payment, and perhaps there's a different way to model the cost sharing.\n\nLet me consider another angle: perhaps the $2 less is the total amount saved by all participants when one more joins.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The problem says \"everyone will pay $2 less,\" which means each person's share decreases by $2.\n\nI think I need to stick with the original equation.\n\nLet me try to solve \\( n^2 + n - 45 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula again:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 180}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{181}}{2} \\]\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{181} \\) is approximately 13.453, then:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-1 + 13.453}{2} \\approx 6.2265 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, \\( n \\approx 6 \\).\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects us to round to 6 friends originally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total cost isn't $90, but something else that leads to an integer solution. But as per the problem, it's $90.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the problem allows for friends to pay fractions of a dollar, which is plausible in real life with digital payments.\n\nIn that case, \\( n = 6.2265 \\) could be acceptable, but it's unusual for counting people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my algebra. Let me double-check the equation setup.\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{90}{n} \\)\n\nNew share: \\( \\frac{90}{n + 1} \\)\n\nDifference: \\( \\frac{90}{n} - \\frac{90}{n + 1} = 2 \\)\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( n(n + 1) \\):\n\n\\[ 90(n + 1) - 90n = 2n(n + 1) \\]\n\n\\[ 90n + 90 - 90n = 2n^2 + 2n \\]\n\n\\[ 90 = 2n^2 + 2n \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ 45 = n^2 + n \\]\n\nSo, \\( n^2 + n - 45 = 0 \\)\n\nThis is consistent with what I had before. No mistake in the algebra.\n\nPerhaps the problem is designed to have a non-integer solution to illustrate a point, but that seems unlikely for a basic algebra problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the number of friends is 9.\n\nWait, let's try \\( n = 9 \\):\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{90}{9} = 10 \\) dollars.\n\nWith one more friend: \\( \\frac{90}{10} = 9 \\) dollars.\n\nDifference: \\( 10 - 9 = 1 \\) dollar, which is not $2.\n\nNot matching.\n\nTry \\( n = 5 \\):\n\nOriginal share: \\( \\frac{90}{5} = 18 \\) dollars.\n\nWith one more friend: \\( \\frac{90}{6} = 15 \\) dollars.\n\nDifference: \\( 18 - 15 = 3 \\) dollars, which is more than $2.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to set up the equation differently. Let's let \\( n \\) be the original number of friends.\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{90}{n} - \\frac{90}{n + 1} = 2 \\)\n\nAs before, this leads to the same quadratic equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that with one more friend, each person pays $2 less than the original share per person, considering the new total cost.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"A group of friends decided to share the cost of a $90 meal equally. If one more friend joins, everyone will pay $2 less. How many friends were originally planning to eat?\"\n\nI think I interpreted it correctly, but maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $2 less is the total amount saved per person, not the difference in individual shares.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"everyone will pay $2 less,\" which still refers to the individual share.\n\nI'm stuck with the quadratic equation \\( n^2 + n - 45 = 0 \\), which doesn't have integer solutions.\n\nPerhaps the problem is intended to have a non-integer solution, and the answer is approximately 6 friends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and the total cost is different.\n\nFor example, if the total cost were $90.75, then:\n\n\\[ n^2 + n - 45.375 = 0 \\]\n\nBut that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference is not exactly $2, but approximately $2, and we're expected to round.\n\nGiven that, \\( n \\approx 6 \\) would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of friends is 9.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the problem is meant to be solved by testing integer values for \\( n \\).\n\nLet me make a table:\n\n| n | original share | new share | difference |\n\n|---|----------------|-----------|------------|\n\n| 5 | 18.00          | 15.00     | 3.00       |\n\n| 6 | 15.00          | 12.857    | 2.143      |\n\n| 7 | 12.857         | 11.571    | 1.286      |\n\n| 8 | 11.25          | 10.00     | 1.25       |\n\n| 9 | 10.00          | 9.00      | 1.00       |\n\n|10 | 9.00           | 8.182     | 0.818      |\n\nFrom this, \\( n = 6 \\) gives a difference closest to $2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to set up the equation and solve it, accepting a non-integer solution.\n\nBut typically, for counting people, integer solutions are expected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of friends is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total cost and how it's divided.\n\nOriginal scenario: \\( n \\) friends share $90, so each pays \\( \\frac{90}{n} \\).\n\nNew scenario: \\( n + 1 \\) friends share $90, so each pays \\( \\frac{90}{n + 1} \\).\n\nThe difference is $2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{n} - \\frac{90}{n + 1} = 2 \\]\n\nAs before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{n} = \\frac{90}{n + 1} + 2 \\]\n\nThen, subtract \\( \\frac{90}{n + 1} \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{90}{n} - \\frac{90}{n + 1} = 2 \\]\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can multiply both sides by \\( n(n + 1) \\):\n\n\\[ 90(n + 1) - 90n = 2n(n + 1) \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ 90n + 90 - 90n = 2n^2 + 2n \\]\n\n\\[ 90 = 2n^2 + 2n \\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[ 45 = n^2 + n \\]\n\nSo, \\( n^2 + n - 45 = 0 \\)\n\nAgain, same quadratic equation.\n\nI think I need to accept that the solution isn't an integer and choose the closest whole number, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the original number of friends planning to eat was approximately 6.\n\nBut this seems unsatisfactory because the difference isn't exactly $2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem means that with one more friend, the total amount paid by the group is $2 less per person.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total bill is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have a non-integer solution, and we're supposed to interpret it accordingly.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is that there were originally 6 friends planning to eat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
