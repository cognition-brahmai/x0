        "content": "So there are 7 billion people on Earth, and each person breathes an average of 16 times per minute. I need to find out how many breaths all humans take together in one hour. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many breaths one person takes in one minute. That's given as 16 breaths per minute.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many breaths one person takes in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can multiply the breaths per minute by 60.\n\nSo, breaths per hour per person = 16 breaths/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 960 breaths/hour.\n\nNow, there are 7 billion people on Earth. So, to find the total breaths taken by all humans in one hour, I need to multiply the breaths per hour per person by the total number of people.\n\nTotal breaths per hour = 960 breaths/hour/person * 7,000,000,000 people.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n960 * 7,000,000,000 = 960 * 7 * 1,000,000,000 = 6,720,000,000,000.\n\nSo, that's 6.72 trillion breaths per hour for all humans combined.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total breaths per minute for all humans and then multiply by 60 to get the hourly total.\n\nFirst, breaths per minute per person = 16.\n\nTotal breaths per minute for all humans = 16 breaths/minute/person * 7,000,000,000 people = 112,000,000,000 breaths/minute.\n\nThen, breaths per hour = 112,000,000,000 breaths/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 6,720,000,000,000 breaths/hour.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total number of breaths taken by all humans together in one hour is 6.72 trillion.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the average breathing rate is exactly 16 breaths per minute. I recall that the average breathing rate for an adult at rest is about 12-20 breaths per minute, so 16 is within that range. But babies breathe faster, around 30-40 breaths per minute, and children breathe faster than adults but slower than babies. So, assuming an average of 16 breaths per minute for the entire population might be reasonable.\n\nAlso, this calculation assumes that all 7 billion people are breathing at the same rate, which isn't entirely accurate because people are asleep or awake at different times, and breathing rates can vary with activity levels. But since we're looking for an estimate, this should be close enough.\n\nAdditionally, the world population is constantly changing, but using 7 billion is a reasonable approximation for the sake of this calculation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, all humans together take approximately 6.72 trillion breaths in one hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.72 \\text{ trillion breaths per hour}} \\]"
