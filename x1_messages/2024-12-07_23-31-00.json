        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a car uses 3 gallons of gas to drive 100 miles, and I need to find out how much gas it'll use on a 450-mile trip. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the miles driven and the gas used. The problem says that the car uses 3 gallons for every 100 miles. So, it's a ratio of 3 gallons per 100 miles. I need to find out how many gallons it uses for 450 miles.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find out how much gas the car uses per mile, and then multiply that by 450 miles. So, if it uses 3 gallons for 100 miles, then for one mile, it would use 3/100 gallons. That sounds right.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3 divided by 100 is 0.03 gallons per mile. So, for each mile, the car uses 0.03 gallons of gas.\n\nNow, for a 450-mile trip, I'll multiply 0.03 gallons per mile by 450 miles. Let's do that multiplication: 0.03 times 450.\n\nWell, 0.03 is the same as 3 hundredths, so 3 hundredths times 450. That should be 13.5 gallons. Wait, does that make sense?\n\nLet me check another way. If 100 miles require 3 gallons, then 400 miles would require 4 times that, right? Because 400 is 4 times 100.\n\nSo, 4 times 3 gallons is 12 gallons for 400 miles. Then, for the remaining 50 miles, which is half of 100 miles, it should use half of 3 gallons, which is 1.5 gallons.\n\nSo, total gas used would be 12 gallons plus 1.5 gallons, which is 13.5 gallons. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up a proportion. If 100 miles corresponds to 3 gallons, then 450 miles corresponds to x gallons. So, 100 miles / 3 gallons = 450 miles / x gallons.\n\nTo find x, I can cross-multiply: 100 * x = 3 * 450, which simplifies to 100x = 1350. Then, divide both sides by 100 to solve for x: x = 1350 / 100, which is 13.5 gallons.\n\nAll these methods are leading me to the same answer: 13.5 gallons. I think that's pretty confident.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is the car's gas consumption constant regardless of speed or conditions? The problem doesn't specify anything else, so I'll assume that the consumption rate is constant.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The trip is 450 miles, and the consumption is given in gallons per 100 miles, but ultimately, the answer is in gallons, which seems correct.\n\nSo, I'm pretty sure that 13.5 gallons is the right answer. But let's try one more approach to confirm.\n\nIf I think about it in terms of fuel efficiency, which is often measured in miles per gallon (mpg), I can calculate that first and then find the gas used.\n\nGiven that the car uses 3 gallons for 100 miles, its fuel efficiency is 100 miles / 3 gallons, which is approximately 33.33 mpg.\n\nThen, for a 450-mile trip, the gas used would be 450 miles divided by 33.33 mpg. Let's do that division: 450 divided by 33.33 is approximately 13.5 gallons.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Okay, I'm convinced.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of rounding errors or if the problem expects a different form of the answer.\n\nI had to divide 1350 by 100 to get 13.5, which is precise. Alternatively, 13.5 gallons could also be expressed as 27/2 gallons, but the decimal form is more straightforward.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify whether to round to a certain decimal place, but since the given consumption is 3 gallons per 100 miles, which is precise, and the trip is exactly 450 miles, I think 13.5 gallons is acceptable.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. It seems like a straightforward proportional reasoning problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13.5} \\]"
