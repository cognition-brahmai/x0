        "content": "So there are 10 red balls and 20 blue balls in a box, and I need to find the probability of picking a red ball randomly. Alright, probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the box, which are both red and blue.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of balls in the box. There are 10 red and 20 blue, so total balls = 10 + 20 = 30 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls, which is 10.\n\nSo, probability of picking a red ball = number of red balls / total number of balls = 10 / 30.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10, which gives me 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but probabilities can also be expressed as decimals or percentages. Let me see, 1 divided by 3 is approximately 0.333, which is about 33.3%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 33.3% chance of picking a red ball.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form, I can probably leave it as a fraction.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
