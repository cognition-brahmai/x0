        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour and it takes 5 hours. So, the distance between Town A and Town B is speed times time, which is 60 miles per hour times 5 hours, so that's 300 miles.\n\nNow, on the way back from Town B to Town A, the train stops at Town C for 30 minutes. But the problem doesn't say anything about the speed on the way back or any other stops, so I'll assume it travels back at the same speed of 60 miles per hour, unless told otherwise.\n\nSo, the time to travel back from Town B to Town A would be the distance divided by the speed. Distance is 300 miles, speed is 60 miles per hour, so time is 300 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, which is 5 hours.\n\nBut there's a stop at Town C for 30 minutes. So, I need to add that stop time to the travel time.\n\nFirst, convert 30 minutes to hours because the other times are in hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.\n\nSo, total time for the round trip including the stop is time from A to B plus time from B to A plus stop time.\n\nThat's 5 hours + 5 hours + 0.5 hours = 10.5 hours.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the stop at Town C affects the back journey. The problem says \"on its way back to Town A, the train stops at Town C for 30 minutes.\" So, the stop is during the back journey.\n\nSo, the total time would be the time to go from A to B, which is 5 hours, plus the time to go from B to A, which is 5 hours, plus the 0.5 hours stop.\n\nSo, 5 + 5 + 0.5 = 10.5 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if the stop is included in the back journey time. Maybe the 5 hours back already includes the stop. But the problem says \"the train stops at Town C for 30 minutes,\" so I think that's in addition to the travel time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stop is during the back journey, so it's already included in the 5 hours.\n\nWait, but if the train is stopping at Town C, that's probably an additional time beyond the travel time.\n\nBut perhaps in train travel, stop times are already included in the total journey time.\n\nI'm a bit confused now.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nTypically, in train schedules, the travel time includes all stops along the way. So, the 5 hours from B to A probably already includes the stop at Town C.\n\nIn that case, the total time for the round trip would just be the time from A to B plus the time from B to A, which is 5 hours + 5 hours = 10 hours.\n\nBut the problem specifically mentions that the train stops at Town C for 30 minutes on its way back. So, maybe it's an additional stop not already included in the 5-hour back journey.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 hours from B to A includes all stops, including Town C.\n\nBut since the problem specifies the stop at Town C on the way back, perhaps it's an additional stop beyond the usual schedule.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider the time from A to B is 5 hours.\n\nTime from B to A is also 5 hours, assuming the same speed and distance.\n\nNow, there's an additional stop at Town C for 30 minutes on the way back.\n\nSo, total time is 5 hours (A to B) + 5 hours (B to A) + 0.5 hours (stop at C) = 10.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if the stop at Town C is already included in the 5-hour back journey, then the total time would be just 10 hours.\n\nBut since the problem specifically mentions the stop at Town C on the way back, I think it's safe to assume that it's an additional 30 minutes beyond the 5-hour journey time.\n\nTherefore, total time is 10.5 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the possibility that the stop is included in the 5 hours.\n\nIn that case, the total time would be 10 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stop is in addition to the 5-hour journey time, making it 5.5 hours for the back journey.\n\nIn that case, total time would be 5 hours (A to B) + 5.5 hours (B to A) = 10.5 hours.\n\nI think the safest assumption is that the stop is additional, so the total time is 10.5 hours.\n\nSo, the answer is 10.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
