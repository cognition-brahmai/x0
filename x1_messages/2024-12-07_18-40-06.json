        "content": "Ah, that sounds like a riddle! \"Who is he that runs without a leg and his house on his back?\" Hmm, let's see. Running without a leg suggests something that moves but doesn't have legs like we do. And carrying his house on his back means it has some sort of shelter or shell attached to it.\n\nCould it be a snail? Snails move using a single foot, which isn't really a leg in the traditional sense, and they carry their homes on their backs in the form of shells. That seems to fit both parts of the riddle.\n\nBut maybe there are other possibilities. For example, a turtle also carries its house on its back, but turtles have legs. So that might not fit because the riddle specifies \"without a leg.\" Although turtles have legs, perhaps the riddle is emphasizing that the main mode of movement isn't using legs but rather the shell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a crab. Crabs have legs, but they move sideways, which could be considered \"running without a leg\" in a metaphorical sense. But again, they do have legs, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, what about a tortoise? Similar to a turtle, but generally living on land. But again, tortoises have legs.\n\nPerhaps it's a snail, as I initially thought. Snails move by gliding on a muscular foot and secrete mucus to reduce friction, which is quite different from the way animals with legs move. So, in a way, they run without legs.\n\nLet me check if there are any other creatures that fit this description. Maybe a slug? But slugs don't have a house on their back; they don't carry shells.\n\nSo, among the options, snails seem to be the best fit. They move without legs and carry their houses on their backs.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any mythical or fictional creatures that fit this description. For example, a hermit crab might come to mind because they carry shells, but they do have legs.\n\nAlternatively, in some mythologies, there are creatures called \"back-creatures\" or something similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a\u8717\u725b (snail in Chinese), which is literally translated as \"spiral creature\" or something similar in other languages.\n\nIn some cultures, there might be different interpretations, but based on what I know, snails are the most likely answer.\n\nLet me see if there's any famous riddle that matches this description. In literature or folklore, is there a character or creature described this way?\n\nFor instance, in \"The Hobbit,\" there are talking animals, but I don't recall any that fit this specific description.\n\nAlternatively, in Aesop's fables, there are various animals with different traits, but I don't remember one that matches this exactly.\n\nPerhaps it's just a straightforward riddle meant to describe a snail.\n\nAlternatively, could it be applied metaphorically to something else? Like a person carrying a heavy burden on their back, metaphorically their house, and moving without legs, perhaps referring to someone who is immobilized or confined.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch. The most straightforward answer is likely the correct one: a snail.\n\nLet me consider the phrasing again: \"runs without a leg.\" Snails do move, but they don't run in the way we think of running. Maybe the riddle is being playful with words.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's referring to a rolling object, like a wheel with a house on it. But that doesn't make much sense in the context of running without legs.\n\nWait, what about a rolling stone? But that doesn't carry a house on its back.\n\nMaybe it's a type of insect or crustacean that carries a shell.\n\nWait, is there such a thing as a pill bug or woodlouse? They curl up into a ball, resembling a tiny armadillo, and they do have legs, but maybe the legs aren't easily visible when they're curled up.\n\nBut they don't exactly run; they crawl.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is more abstract. Maybe it's referring to a cloud, which moves across the sky without legs and has a house on its back in the form of precipitation or something.\n\nBut that seems too far-fetched.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of vehicle, like a tank, which moves on treads rather than legs and carries armor on its back.\n\nBut that feels like a modern interpretation, and riddles often have classic answers.\n\nI think I'll stick with the snail as the most likely answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{snail}} \\]"
