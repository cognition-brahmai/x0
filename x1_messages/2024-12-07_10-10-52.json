        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to understand what the factory is currently producing and then see how that changes with the increase in production rate.\n\nSo, the factory currently produces 500 units of product X in 8 hours. That means we can calculate the current production rate per hour. To find that, we divide the total units by the total hours:\n\nProduction rate = Total units / Total hours\nProduction rate = 500 units / 8 hours\nProduction rate = 62.5 units per hour\n\nNow, the factory is increasing its production rate by 25%. To find the new production rate, we need to calculate 25% of the current production rate and then add that to the current rate.\n\nFirst, let's find 25% of 62.5 units per hour:\n\n25% of 62.5 = 0.25 * 62.5\n             = 15.625 units per hour\n\nNow, add that to the current production rate to get the new production rate:\n\nNew production rate = Current production rate + Increase\nNew production rate = 62.5 + 15.625\nNew production rate = 78.125 units per hour\n\nNext, we need to find out how many units will be produced in 10 hours at this new production rate.\n\nTotal units = New production rate * Total hours\nTotal units = 78.125 units/hour * 10 hours\nTotal units = 781.25 units\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a unit in most cases, we might need to round this to the nearest whole number. But let's check if the problem specifies how to handle fractions.\n\nIf we're to round to the nearest whole number, 781.25 rounds to 781 units.\n\nWait a minute, but in some contexts, especially in manufacturing, you might not produce a partial unit, so it could be reasonable to consider only complete units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product can be divided, but since it's not specified, I'll assume we need whole units.\n\nBut to be precise, let's consider that the factory produces 781.25 units. If partial units are not acceptable, then it would be 781 units.\n\nHowever, perhaps I should verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recalculate the production rate increase:\n\nOriginal production rate: 62.5 units/hour\nIncrease: 25% of 62.5 = 0.25 * 62.5 = 15.625 units/hour\nNew production rate: 62.5 + 15.625 = 78.125 units/hour\n\nThen, in 10 hours: 78.125 * 10 = 781.25 units\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to increase the total production by 25% and then see how much is produced in 10 hours.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total production with the increased rate over the new time period.\n\nLet's think differently. If the factory increases its production rate by 25%, that means it's now operating at 125% of its original production rate.\n\nSo, original production in 8 hours: 500 units\n\nFirst, find the original production rate per hour: 500 / 8 = 62.5 units/hour\n\nThen, new production rate: 62.5 * 1.25 = 78.125 units/hour\n\nThen, in 10 hours: 78.125 * 10 = 781.25 units\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the total production with the increased rate.\n\nOriginal production in 8 hours: 500 units\n\nIncreased by 25%, so new production in 8 hours: 500 * 1.25 = 625 units\n\nBut wait, this is if the total production is increased by 25%, not the production rate.\n\nWait, the problem says the factory increases its production rate by 25%.\n\nSo, it's the rate that increases, not the total production.\n\nTherefore, my first approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of proportion.\n\nIf the production rate increases by 25%, the new rate is 125% of the original rate.\n\nSo, if originally in 8 hours it produces 500 units, then with a 25% increase in rate, in the same 8 hours, it would produce 500 * 1.25 = 625 units.\n\nBut we need to find out production in 10 hours.\n\nSo, now, we need to find the production in 10 hours at this new rate.\n\nFirst, find the new production rate per hour: 625 units / 8 hours = 78.125 units/hour\n\nThen, in 10 hours: 78.125 * 10 = 781.25 units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this.\n\nLet me recall that rate * time = production.\n\nOriginal rate: R = 500 / 8 = 62.5 units/hour\n\nNew rate: R_new = R * 1.25 = 62.5 * 1.25 = 78.125 units/hour\n\nProduction in new time: P_new = R_new * T_new = 78.125 * 10 = 781.25 units\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use ratios.\n\nIf the rate increases by 25%, the new rate is 125% of the old rate.\n\nSo, the production is directly proportional to the rate and the time.\n\nTherefore, P_new = P_original * (R_new / R_original) * (T_new / T_original)\n\nBut since R_new = R_original * 1.25, and T_new is different, we can plug in:\n\nP_new = 500 * (1.25) * (10 / 8)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 1.25 * (10 / 8) = 1.25 * 1.25 = 1.5625\n\nThen, P_new = 500 * 1.5625 = 781.25 units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nThis gives me confidence that 781.25 units is the correct production in 10 hours with a 25% increase in production rate.\n\nNow, considering that partial units may not be possible, we might need to round this to the nearest whole number.\n\n781.25 rounds to 781 units if we're dealing with whole units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory can produce half units or fractions, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume whole units.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 781 units in 10 hours with a 25% increase in production rate.\n\nWait, but mathematically, it's 781.25 units. In reality, the factory might produce 781 units completely and have half of the 782nd unit produced.\n\nBut typically, in such problems, if it's not specified, we might leave it as 781.25 units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory measures production in units and fractions are acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 781.25 units.\n\nBut to present it neatly, perhaps we can box the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{781.25} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{781} \\]"
