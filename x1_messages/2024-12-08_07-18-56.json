Let's see...\n\n(Verse 1)\nIn the quiet corners of our lives,\nWhere laughter and whispers intertwine,\nThere's a bond that stretches far and wide,\nLike the colors of a sunset so divine.\n\nWe walk together through the seasons,\nHand in hand, side by side,\nThrough the ups and downs, the highs and lows,\nOur friendship is a guiding light, never to subside.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, friendship, sweet friendship,\nYou're the melody that fills my heart,\nWith every beat, with every breath,\nYou're the rhythm that makes me start.\n\nOh, friendship, true and faithful,\nIn you, I find my strength and might,\nTogether we'll face whatever comes,\nHand in hand, through day and night.\n\n(Verse 2)\nRemember the days when we were young,\nFull of dreams and endless possibilities,\nWe built castles in the air,\nAnd chased after rainbows so fiercely.\n\nNow, as time goes by and we grow older,\nOur friendship only grows stronger still,\nA treasure that we hold so dear,\nA bond that nothing can fulfill.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, friendship, pure and simple,\nYou're the song that plays in my mind,\nWith every chord, with every note,\nYou're the harmony that I find.\n\nOh, friendship, ever-lasting,\nIn you, I see the future bright,\nTogether we'll make memories to last,\nThrough thick and thin, through day and night.\n\n(Bridge)\nWhen the world seems cold and distant,\nAnd shadows try to take their hold,\nOur friendship warms my heart and soul,\nMaking everything feel whole.\n\nSo here's to us, to our journey,\nTo the miles we've walked together,\nMay our friendship never fade away,\nBut continue to flourish, forever and ever.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, friendship, dear companion,\nYou're the verse that completes my song,\nWith every strum, with every lyric,\nYou're the chorus that we all belong.\n\nOh, friendship, strong and steady,\nIn you, I find my anchor's hold,\nTogether we'll navigate life's seas,\nHand in hand, growing old.\n\n(Outro)\nSo here's to friendship, the Beatles way,\nMay it shine like the sun every day,\nIn every note, in every rhyme,\nOur friendship is a beautiful chime.\n\n**End of Song**"
