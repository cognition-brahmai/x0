The sunlight filters through the dense canopy above, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. You feel a sense of tranquility wash over you as you take your first steps into this magical realm.\n\nTo your left, you see a path that winds its way deeper into the forest, lined with luminous mushrooms that glow softly in the dim light. To your right, there's a gentle stream flowing over smooth stones, its crystal-clear waters inviting you to dip your toes in. Straight ahead, an ancient oak tree stands tall, its branches reaching out as if to welcome you.\n\nWhich direction would you like to explore first? The glowing mushroom path, the serene stream, or the majestic oak tree?"
