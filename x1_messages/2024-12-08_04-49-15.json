        "content": "The theory that suggests society is best understood as a complex system characterized by inequality and conflict that generate social change is Conflict Theory. So, the correct answer is A. Conflict Theory.\n\nTo elaborate, Conflict Theory is a sociological perspective that argues society is in a state of perpetual conflict because of competition for limited resources. This competition is influenced by factors like class, race, gender, and other social categories that lead to inequality and power imbalances. According to this theory, these conflicts and inequalities are the primary drivers of social change.\n\nFunctionalism, on the other hand, views society as a well-organized system with interconnected parts that work together to maintain stability and equilibrium. It emphasizes social consensus and the idea that social institutions fulfill necessary functions for the smooth operation of society.\n\nSymbolic Interactionism focuses on the day-to-day interactions between individuals and how they create meaning and understanding through symbols and language. It's more micro-level, looking at individual behaviors and interactions rather than large-scale social structures.\n\nRational Choice Theory is an economic and social theory that suggests that individuals make choices based on rational calculations, aiming to maximize their own interests or utilities. It's often used in sociology to explain social phenomena by assuming that people act in their own self-interest.\n\nSo, among these options, Conflict Theory is the one that emphasizes inequality and conflict as drivers of social change."
