        "content": "Let's see. There are 25 students in the chemistry class, and each student needs 0.5 liters of solution A and 0.3 liters of solution B for their experiment. I need to find out how much of each solution the teacher should prepare for the whole class.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total amount of solution A needed. Since each student needs 0.5 liters and there are 25 students, I can multiply 0.5 liters by 25.\n\nSo, 0.5 liters/student \u00d7 25 students = 12.5 liters of solution A.\n\nNext, for solution B, each student needs 0.3 liters. Again, there are 25 students, so I'll multiply 0.3 liters by 25.\n\n0.3 liters/student \u00d7 25 students = 7.5 liters of solution B.\n\nTherefore, the teacher needs to prepare 12.5 liters of solution A and 7.5 liters of solution B for the entire class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.5 \\text{ liters of solution A and } 7.5 \\text{ liters of solution B}} \\]"
