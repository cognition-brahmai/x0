        "content": "To find the average speed for the entire round trip, we need to consider both the distance traveled and the time taken for each leg of the journey. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n\nLet's denote the distance between City A and City B as \\( d \\) kilometers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time taken for the trip from City A to City B. The speed is 80 km/h, so the time taken is:\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{d}{80} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time taken for the return trip from City B to City A. The speed is 100 km/h, so the time taken is:\n\\[\nt_2 = \\frac{d}{100} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = d + d = 2d \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nThe total time for the round trip is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{80} + \\frac{d}{100} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 80 and 100 is 400. So:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{80} = \\frac{5d}{400} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d}{100} = \\frac{4d}{400}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{5d}{400} + \\frac{4d}{400} = \\frac{9d}{400} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, the average speed \\( v \\) is:\n\\[\nv = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{9d}{400}} = 2d \\times \\frac{400}{9d} = \\frac{800d}{9d} = \\frac{800}{9} \\approx 88.89 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire round trip is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{800}{9} \\text{ km/h}}\n\\]\nor approximately \\( 88.89 \\) km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{800}{9} \\text{ km/h}}"
