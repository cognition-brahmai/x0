        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 8 green balls. So, in total, there are 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 balls in the box. I need to find the probability of picking a red or blue ball without looking.\n\nOkay, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball. So, the number of favorable outcomes should be the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, which is 5 + 7 = 12.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 20.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking a red or blue ball should be P = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 12 / 20.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives P = 3 / 5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal, which is 0.6, or as a percentage, which is 60%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of mutually exclusive events. Picking a red ball and picking a blue ball are mutually exclusive events because I can't pick both at the same time, right? So, the probability of picking red or blue should be the sum of the probabilities of picking red and picking blue.\n\nLet me calculate that. The probability of picking red is number of red balls divided by total balls, which is 5/20 = 1/4 = 0.25.\n\nThe probability of picking blue is 7/20 = 0.35.\n\nSo, the probability of picking red or blue should be 0.25 + 0.35 = 0.6, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nGood, it's consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what if I consider the probability of not picking green? Because the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green balls is 8, so the probability of picking green is 8/20 = 0.4.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking green is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, which again matches the previous results.\n\nSo, all these approaches lead me to the same answer: the probability is 0.6 or 60% or 3/5.\n\nI think I've covered it from different angles and confirmed the answer is consistent. Unless there's some trick I'm missing, but based on the information given, this seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
