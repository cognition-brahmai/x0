        "content": "So, there's this puzzle about barbers in a small town, right? There are five barbers, and each one says they only shave people who don't shave themselves. The question is, who shaves the barbers?\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let me try to wrap my head around it. So, if a barber only shaves those who don't shave themselves, that means he doesn't shave people who do shave themselves, right? So, does that mean he doesn't shave himself?\n\nWait a minute, if he doesn't shave himself, then according to his rule, he should be shaved by someone else because he doesn't shave himself. But all the other barbers have the same rule, so they also only shave people who don't shave themselves.\n\nSo, if a barber doesn't shave himself, then another barber should shave him, but that other barber only shaves those who don't shave themselves. So, if the first barber doesn't shave himself, then the second barber can shave him, but only if the first barber doesn't shave himself, which he doesn't.\n\nBut then, who shaves the second barber? If the second barber doesn't shave himself, then he needs to be shaved by a third barber, who also only shaves those who don't shave themselves.\n\nThis seems like it could go in a circle, where each barber shaves another barber, and none of them shave themselves. Is that possible?\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Suppose we have five barbers: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n- A shaves B, who doesn't shave himself.\n\n- B shaves C, who doesn't shave himself.\n\n- C shaves D, who doesn't shave himself.\n\n- D shaves E, who doesn't shave himself.\n\n- E shaves A, who doesn't shave himself.\n\nSo, in this setup, each barber shaves another barber, and none of them shave themselves. That seems to satisfy the condition that each barber only shaves those who don't shave themselves.\n\nBut is there a problem with this arrangement? Let's check.\n\nIf A shaves B, and B doesn't shave himself, that's fine. Similarly, B shaves C, who doesn't shave himself, and so on, up to E shaving A, who doesn't shave himself.\n\nEverything seems consistent here. So, in this scenario, each barber is shaved by another barber, and no barber shaves himself.\n\nWait, but the question is, who shaves the barbers? In this case, each barber is shaved by another barber in a circular fashion.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. What if one of the barbers decides to shave himself?\n\nLet's say, for example, barber A decides to shave himself. But according to the rule, he only shaves those who don't shave themselves. So, if he shaves himself, that means he is shaving someone (himself) who does shave himself, which contradicts his rule.\n\nTherefore, no barber can shave himself. They must all be shaved by another barber.\n\nSo, in that case, the only possibility is that they shave each other in some arrangement where no barber shaves himself.\n\nBut in the circular arrangement I proposed earlier, that seems to work. So, perhaps that's the answer: each barber is shaved by another barber in a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different arrangement. For example, perhaps some barbers shave more than one other barber.\n\nLet me consider that. Suppose barber A shaves barbers B and C, barber B shaves barbers C and D, barber C shaves barbers D and E, barber D shaves barbers E and A, and barber E shaves barbers A and B.\n\nBut wait, in this case, each barber is shaving other barbers who don't shave themselves, which they don't, so it seems consistent.\n\nHowever, this seems more complicated than the initial circular arrangement. Maybe the simplest solution is the best: a single cycle where each barber shaves exactly one other barber.\n\nSo, in conclusion, each barber is shaved by another barber in a circular fashion, and no barber shaves himself. This satisfies the condition that each barber only shaves those who don't shave themselves.\n\nIs there any other possible arrangement? For example, could there be a hierarchy where one barber shaves the others, but not vice versa?\n\nLet's see. Suppose barber A shaves barbers B, C, D, and E, and none of them shave themselves or each other.\n\nBut in this case, barber A is shaving barbers who don't shave themselves, which is consistent with his rule. However, who shaves barber A? If barber A doesn't shave himself, then he needs to be shaved by one of the other barbers, but they are all shaved by barber A, so that can't happen.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction because if barber A shaves the other barbers, who shaves barber A?\n\nTherefore, this arrangement doesn't work. So, it's not possible for one barber to shave all the others without creating a paradox.\n\nThus, the only viable arrangement is the circular one where each barber shaves exactly one other barber, and is shaved by another barber in turn.\n\nSo, the answer is that each barber is shaved by another barber in a cycle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Each barber is shaved by another barber in a cycle.}} \\]"
