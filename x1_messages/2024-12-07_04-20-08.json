        "content": "So the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system. They've got 100 buses right now, each holding 50 passengers. They want to increase the total passenger capacity by 25%, and they want to keep an average of 70% occupancy. They need to figure out how many more buses they need and how to spread out the routes for these new buses. And they have to think about busy times, where people live, and what's already in place for transportation.\n\nFirst, let's understand what they have now. They have 100 buses, each with a capacity of 50 passengers. So, the total capacity now is 100 buses times 50 passengers, which is 5,000 passengers.\n\nThey want to increase this by 25%. So, 25% of 5,000 is 1,250 additional passengers. That means they want a total capacity of 5,000 plus 1,250, which is 6,250 passengers.\n\nBut they want an average occupancy rate of 70%. That means, on average, they want each bus to be 70% full. So, if we let \u2018n\u2019 be the total number of buses needed to carry 6,250 passengers at 70% capacity, we can set up an equation.\n\nEach bus has a capacity of 50 passengers. At 70% occupancy, each bus carries 50 times 0.7, which is 35 passengers.\n\nSo, if each bus carries 35 passengers, and they want a total capacity of 6,250 passengers, then the total number of buses needed is 6,250 divided by 35.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6,250 divided by 35 is approximately 178.57 buses. Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, they'd need 179 buses in total.\n\nThey already have 100 buses, so they need 179 minus 100, which is 79 additional buses.\n\nNow, for the optimal route distribution, they need to consider a few factors: peak travel times, population density, and existing transit infrastructure.\n\nFirst, peak travel times. Typically, people travel to work in the morning and back in the evening, so there are peak hours in the morning and evening. They need to make sure that there are enough buses during these times to handle the higher demand.\n\nSecond, population density. Areas with more people will need more frequent buses or larger buses to handle the passenger load. So, routes that go through densely populated areas should have more buses assigned to them.\n\nThird, existing transit infrastructure. They need to look at where buses already run and maybe fill in gaps where there's no service or insufficient service. They should also consider transferring points, where passengers can switch from one bus to another, to make sure that connections are efficient.\n\nSo, in terms of distributing the new buses, they could:\n\n1. Add more buses to existing routes during peak hours to reduce wait times and accommodate more passengers.\n\n2. Extend existing routes into areas that are currently underserved but have high population density.\n\n3. Create new routes in areas that are growing or have been neglected by the current system.\n\n4. Improve connections between different parts of the city by enhancing transfer points.\n\nThey should also consider the efficiency of the routes. For example, avoiding too many stops that can slow down the buses, or optimizing the routes to cover the most populated areas in the shortest possible time.\n\nAdditionally, they might want to look into demand-responsive transport, where buses can be rerouted based on real-time demand, but that might be more complex to implement.\n\nIn summary, they need 79 additional buses to meet the increased capacity requirement while maintaining a 70% occupancy rate. For route distribution, they should focus on enhancing service during peak times, covering areas with high population density, and improving the overall connectivity of the transit network.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{79} \\]"
