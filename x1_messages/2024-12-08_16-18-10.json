        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple text-based calculator in Python that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator should take user input as a string in the format \"number1 operator number2\", like \"5 + 3\", and then perform the operation and display the result. Also, it needs to validate the input and show an error message if the format is incorrect.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to think about how to accept and parse the user's input. Since the input is a string in a specific format, I'll probably need to split the string into parts: number1, the operator, and number2. In Python, the split() function can be useful here. It can split a string based on spaces by default, so \"5 + 3\" would be split into [\"5\", \"+\", \"3\"].\n\nNext, I need to validate that the input consists of exactly three parts: two numbers and one operator in between. So, after splitting the input, I should check if the list has exactly three elements. If not, I'll print an error message.\n\nAssuming the input has three parts, I need to convert the first and third parts (number1 and number2) into actual numbers, probably floats, to handle decimal points. I'll use the float() function for that. If the conversion fails, meaning that number1 or number2 isn't a valid number, I should catch the exception and display an error message.\n\nThen, I need to check what operator is provided and perform the corresponding operation.\n\n- If the operator is '+', I'll add number1 and number2.\n\n- If it's '-', I'll subtract number2 from number1.\n\n- If it's '*', I'll multiply them.\n\n- If it's '/', I'll divide number1 by number2, but I need to check if number2 is not zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nIf the operator is none of these, I'll display an error message saying the operator is not supported.\n\nFinally, I'll print the result of the operation.\n\nI should also think about looping this process so that the user can perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. Maybe I can put the whole functionality in a loop and ask the user if they want to perform another calculation after each operation.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start a loop (e.g., while True:) to keep the calculator running.\n\n2. Prompt the user to enter a calculation in the format \"number1 operator number2\".\n\n3. Read the user's input.\n\n4. Split the input by spaces into a list.\n\n5. Check if the list has exactly three elements; if not, print an error message and continue to the next iteration.\n\n6. Try to convert the first and third elements to floats.\n\n7. If conversion fails, print an error message and continue to the next iteration.\n\n8. Check the operator:\n\n- If '+', add the numbers.\n\n- If '-', subtract.\n\n- If '*', multiply.\n\n- If '/', divide, but check for division by zero.\n\n- If none of these, print an error message.\n\n9. Print the result.\n\n10. Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.\n\n11. If yes, continue the loop; otherwise, exit.\n\nI need to make sure to handle potential exceptions, like division by zero, and invalid inputs gracefully, providing clear error messages to the user.\n\nLet me consider some edge cases:\n\n- Input with only two parts, like \"5 +\".\n\n- Input with more than three parts, like \"5 + 3 - 2\".\n\n- Invalid numbers, like \"five + three\".\n\n- Invalid operators, like \"5 % 3\".\n\n- Division by zero, like \"5 / 0\".\n\nFor each of these cases, I should have error handling in place to inform the user what went wrong without crashing the program.\n\nI should also think about the user interface. Keeping it simple and straightforward would be best. Maybe I can display a welcome message and instructions on how to use the calculator.\n\nAdditionally, I can add an option to exit the program, perhaps by allowing the user to enter 'quit' or 'exit' instead of a calculation.\n\nLet me sketch a rough code structure:\n\nwhile True:\n\nprint(\"Enter calculation in the format 'number1 operator number2' (e.g., '5 + 3').\")\n\nprint(\"Enter 'quit' to exit.\")\n\nuser_input = input(\">>> \")\n\nif user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n\nbreak\n\nparts = user_input.split()\n\nif len(parts) != 3:\n\nprint(\"Error: Input must contain exactly three parts.\")\n\ncontinue\n\ntry:\n\nnum1 = float(parts[0])\n\noperator = parts[1]\n\nnum2 = float(parts[2])\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(\"Error: Invalid number format.\")\n\ncontinue\n\nif operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n\nprint(\"Error: Unsupported operator.\")\n\ncontinue\n\nif operator == '+':\n\nresult = num1 + num2\n\nelif operator == '-':\n\nresult = num1 - num2\n\nelif operator == '*':\n\nresult = num1 * num2\n\nelif operator == '/':\n\nif num2 == 0:\n\nprint(\"Error: Division by zero.\")\n\ncontinue\n\nresult = num1 / num2\n\nprint(\"Result:\", result)\n\nprint()  # For better readability between calculations.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to implement this in Python.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple text-based calculator in Python that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can follow the steps below. This calculator will take user input in the format \"number1 operator number2\" (e.g., \"5 + 3\"), validate the input, perform the operation, and display the result.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Read user input and split it into parts based on spaces.\n2. **Validation**: Ensure the input consists of exactly three parts: two numbers and one operator.\n3. **Conversion**: Convert the numbers from strings to floats.\n4. **Operation**: Perform the specified operation based on the operator provided.\n5. **Error Handling**: Manage errors such as invalid format, unsupported operators, and division by zero.\n6. **Looping**: Allow the user to perform multiple calculations or choose to quit.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    print(\"Enter calculation in the format 'number1 operator number2' (e.g., '5 + 3').\")\n    print(\"Enter 'quit' to exit.\")\n    user_input = input(\">>> \")\n    \n    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':\n        break\n    \n    parts = user_input.split()\n    if len(parts) != 3:\n        print(\"Error: Input must contain exactly three parts.\")\n        continue\n    \n    try:\n        num1 = float(parts[0])\n        operator = parts[1]\n        num2 = float(parts[2])\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid number format.\")\n        continue\n    \n    if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        print(\"Error: Unsupported operator.\")\n        continue\n    \n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero.\")\n            continue\n        result = num1 / num2\n    \n    print(\"Result:\", result)\n    print()  # For better readability between calculations.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input as a string and splits it into a list based on spaces.\n2. **Validation**: Checks if the split list has exactly three elements. If not, it prompts an error.\n3. **Conversion**: Tries to convert the first and third elements to floats. If conversion fails, it alerts the user.\n4. **Operation**: Depending on the operator, it performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n5. **Error Handling**: Handles errors for invalid formats, unsupported operators, and division by zero.\n6. **Looping**: Continuously prompts for new calculations until the user chooses to quit.\n\nThis straightforward approach ensures the calculator is user-friendly and robust against invalid inputs."
