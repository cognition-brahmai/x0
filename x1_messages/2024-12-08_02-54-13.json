        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters long and 200 meters wide. He wants to plant trees along the perimeter at intervals of 25 meters. I need to figure out how many trees he needs.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the perimeter of the field because that's where the trees will be planted. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). So, plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2*(300 + 200) = 2*(500) = 1000 meters.\n\nNow, trees are to be planted at intervals of 25 meters along this 1000-meter perimeter. To find out how many trees are needed, I can divide the perimeter by the interval:\n\nNumber of trees = Perimeter / Interval = 1000 / 25 = 40.\n\nWait a minute, but this seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. When planting trees at intervals along a closed shape like a rectangle, the starting point and the ending point coincide, so the first tree and the last tree would be the same if I just divide the perimeter by the interval. That means I might be counting one tree twice.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct number of trees is actually one less than my initial calculation. Let's see:\n\nNumber of trees = (Perimeter / Interval) - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39.\n\nBut, I'm not sure about this. Maybe I should think differently. Maybe I should calculate the number of trees along each side and then sum them up, making sure not to double-count the corner trees.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nStarting with the length sides:\n\nEach length is 300 meters. If trees are planted at 25-meter intervals, the number of intervals along one length is 300 / 25 = 12. So, the number of trees along one length would be 12 + 1 = 13 (since you need a tree at both ends).\n\nWait, but in a closed loop, the ends are connected, so perhaps it's different.\n\nActually, for a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths.\n\nFor the lengths:\n\nEach length is 300 meters. Number of intervals per length = 300 / 25 = 12. So, number of trees per length = 12 + 1 = 13.\n\nBut since the field is rectangular, the corners are shared by both sides. So, if I just multiply the number of trees per length by 2, I would be double-counting the corner trees.\n\nSimilarly, for the widths:\n\nEach width is 200 meters. Number of intervals per width = 200 / 25 = 8. So, number of trees per width = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAgain, the corners are shared.\n\nSo, total number of trees = (2 * number of trees per length) + (2 * number of trees per width) - 4 (to account for the four corners that are double-counted).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal trees = (2*13) + (2*9) - 4 = 26 + 18 - 4 = 40.\n\nHmm, this matches my initial calculation.\n\nBut earlier I thought about subtracting one because it's a closed loop, but according to this method, it's 40.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the perimeter division is accurate in this case.\n\nLet me consider another way. If I imagine starting at one corner and planting trees every 25 meters around the perimeter, the last tree would be at the starting point, completing the loop. So, in this case, the first and last tree are the same, so maybe the number is indeed 40.\n\nWait, but in the perimeter division method, 1000 / 25 = 40, which matches this thought.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the first tree is planted at the starting point and then every 25 meters, the last tree would be at the 1000-meter mark, which is back at the starting point, so that would be 40 trees in total.\n\nSo, both methods give me 40 trees.\n\nBut I recall that in some similar problems, the number is one less because the starting and ending trees coincide. Maybe I need to think about whether to count the starting tree only once or not.\n\nLet me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have a square with perimeter 100 meters, planting trees every 25 meters.\n\nThe perimeter is 100 meters, intervals of 25 meters, so number of trees = 100 / 25 = 4.\n\nSo, I would have trees at 0 meters, 25 meters, 50 meters, 75 meters, and back to 100 meters, which is the same as 0 meters. So, in this case, it seems like I have 4 trees in total.\n\nBut according to my earlier method, perimeter divided by interval is 4, which matches.\n\nIf I apply the same logic to the original problem, 1000 / 25 = 40 trees.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to plant 40 trees.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether to count the starting tree again at the end, but in reality, since it's a closed loop, the starting tree is the same as the ending tree, so it's correctly counted once.\n\nSo, the final answer is 40 trees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
