        "content": "Let's see. So, in this class, there are 30 students in total, and there are twice as many girls as boys. Then, 5 more boys join the class, and we need to find out how many girls will be in the class after that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many boys and girls are there initially. Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. According to the problem, G = 2B, because there are twice as many girls as boys. Also, the total number of students is 30, so B + G = 30.\n\nNow, substituting G with 2B in the total equation, we get B + 2B = 30, which simplifies to 3B = 30. Therefore, B = 10. That means there are 10 boys initially. Since G = 2B, G = 2 * 10 = 20. So, there are 20 girls initially.\n\nNow, 5 more boys join the class. So, the number of boys becomes 10 + 5 = 15. But the number of girls remains the same unless specified otherwise. So, there are still 20 girls in the class.\n\nWait a minute, the question asks for the number of girls in the class after 5 more boys join. Since no girls are added or removed, the number of girls remains 20.\n\nBut let me double-check. The problem says, \"If 5 more boys join the class, how many girls will be in the class?\" So, the addition of boys doesn't affect the number of girls unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the number of girls stays the same at 20.\n\nHowever, maybe the question is trying to mislead me or test if I'm paying attention. Maybe there's something else I'm missing. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a class of 30 students, there are twice as many girls as boys. If 5 more boys join the class, how many girls will be in the class?\"\n\nNo, it seems straightforward. The number of girls doesn't change just because boys are added. So, the answer should be 20 girls.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the ratio changes or something. Let's explore that.\n\nInitially, boys are 10 and girls are 20. Total students are 30.\n\nAfter 5 more boys join, total boys become 15, and total students become 35.\n\nBut the number of girls is still 20.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is trying to say that after 5 more boys join, the ratio changes, and we need to find the new number of girls based on the new ratio. But that's not specified.\n\nLooking back, the problem clearly states: \"there are twice as many girls as boys.\" That is, G = 2B.\n\nThen, 5 more boys join, so the number of boys becomes B + 5.\n\nBut the number of girls remains G, unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, the number of girls is still G, which is 20.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if the ratio changes after the new boys join.\n\nInitially, B = 10, G = 20.\n\nAfter 5 boys join, B' = 15.\n\nTotal students now are 35.\n\nThe ratio of girls to boys now is G : B' = 20 : 15 = 4 : 3.\n\nBut the original ratio was G : B = 20 : 10 = 2 : 1.\n\nSo, yes, the ratio changes, but the number of girls remains the same unless stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the number of girls in the class after 5 more boys join is still 20.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is expecting me to find the new number of girls based on the new ratio. Perhaps I need to assume that the ratio remains the same after the new boys join.\n\nLet me check that possibility.\n\nIf the ratio of girls to boys remains the same even after 5 more boys join, then G : (B + 5) = 2 : 1.\n\nBut initially, G = 2B.\n\nSo, if G : (B + 5) = 2 : 1, then G = 2(B + 5).\n\nBut we already have G = 2B from the initial condition.\n\nSo, setting them equal: 2B = 2(B + 5).\n\nThat would imply 2B = 2B + 10, which is not possible unless B is infinite, which doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the ratio cannot remain the same if 5 more boys join, given the initial conditions.\n\nHence, my initial approach is correct: the number of girls remains 20 after 5 more boys join the class.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the new ratio, but it's not specified. The problem clearly asks for the number of girls after 5 more boys join, implying that only boys are added and girls remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 girls.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose that when 5 more boys join, the number of girls changes accordingly to maintain some ratio, but that's not stated in the problem.\n\nThe problem states a initial condition and an addition of boys, and asks for the number of girls after that addition.\n\nSince no girls are added or removed, and no other conditions are specified, the number of girls remains 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 20 girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
