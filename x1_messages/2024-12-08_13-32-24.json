        "content": "So, there's this square garden with a perimeter of 48 feet, and John wants to build a fence around it, but he needs to leave a 4-foot-wide opening for a gate. We need to figure out how much fencing John needs.\n\nFirst, since it's a square garden, all four sides are equal in length. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4. So, if the perimeter is 48 feet, we can find the length of one side by dividing 48 by 4.\n\nLet's do that: 48 divided by 4 is 12 feet. So, each side of the square garden is 12 feet long.\n\nNow, John wants to build a fence around the garden but leave a 4-foot opening for the gate. That means the total length of the fencing needed will be the perimeter minus the width of the gate.\n\nSo, fencing needed = perimeter - gate width.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: fencing needed = 48 feet - 4 feet = 44 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but let's double-check.\n\nWe know the perimeter is 48 feet, and the gate is 4 feet wide. So, the fencing should cover the entire perimeter except for the 4 feet where the gate will be.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, John needs 44 feet of fencing.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSince the garden is square, and each side is 12 feet, we can think about where the gate will be placed.\n\nAssume the gate is placed along one of the sides. If the gate is 4 feet wide, then on that particular side, instead of fencing the entire 12 feet, he'll only fence 12 - 4 = 8 feet.\n\nSo, for that side, fencing needed is 8 feet.\n\nFor the other three sides, fencing needed is full length, which is 12 feet each.\n\nSo, total fencing needed would be: 12 + 12 + 12 + 8.\n\nLet's add that up: 12 + 12 is 24, plus another 12 is 36, plus 8 is 44 feet.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, whether we subtract the gate width from the total perimeter or subtract it from one side and add up all the sides, we get 44 feet of fencing needed.\n\nTherefore, John needs 44 feet of fencing.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{44} \\]\n"
