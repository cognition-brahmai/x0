        "content": "Let's see. So, we have a game with three players: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each gets one turn, and they have different probabilities of winning on their turn. Alice has a 1/2 chance, Bob has 1/3, and Carol has 1/4. We need to find out the probability that the game ends after all three have had their turns.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the game to end after all three players have had their turns. That probably means that none of them won on their first turn, and then Carol wins on her turn.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the game ends after all three players have had their turns.\" So, perhaps it means that all three players take their turns, and then the game ends, regardless of who wins.\n\nBut looking back, it seems that each player has a chance to win on their turn, and the game ends as soon as someone wins. So, if Alice wins on her turn, the game ends immediately, and Bob and Carol don't get to play. Similarly, if Bob wins on his turn, Carol doesn't get to play.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probability that the game ends after all three have had their turns. That would mean that neither Alice nor Bob won on their turns, and then Carol wins on her turn.\n\nSo, to calculate this, I need to find the probability that Alice doesn't win on her turn, and Bob doesn't win on his turn, and then Carol wins on her turn.\n\nFirst, the probability that Alice doesn't win on her turn is 1 minus her winning probability, which is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nNext, given that Alice didn't win, it's Bob's turn. The probability that Bob doesn't win on his turn is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nThen, if both Alice and Bob didn't win, it's Carol's turn. The probability that Carol wins on her turn is 1/4.\n\nSo, the overall probability that the game ends after all three players have had their turns is the product of these probabilities:\n\n(1/2) * (2/3) * (1/4)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, (1/2) * (2/3) = (1*2)/(2*3) = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nThen, (1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/12.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game can also end after all three players have had their turns if none of them win, and then the cycle repeats. But the problem seems to suggest that each player gets only one turn, so maybe it's a single cycle.\n\nBut let's check the problem again: \"each player gets one turn.\" So, it's a sequence: Alice, then Bob, then Carol, and then the game ends, regardless of who wins.\n\nWait, no, the game ends as soon as someone wins. So, if Alice wins on her turn, Bob and Carol don't get to play. Similarly, if Bob wins, Carol doesn't get to play. Only if neither Alice nor Bob wins does Carol get a chance to win.\n\nSo, the scenario where all three have had their turns is only when none of them won on their previous turns, and then Carol wins on her turn.\n\nBut the problem says \"the game ends after all three players have had their turns.\" That could also mean that all three have had their turns, and none of them won, and then the game ends.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let's read the problem again: \"What is the probability that the game ends after all three players have had their turns?\"\n\nI think it means that all three players have taken their turns, and then the game ends, implying that none of them won on their turns.\n\nBut, according to the rules, the game ends as soon as someone wins. So, if any player wins on their turn, the game ends immediately.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the game to end after all three have had their turns is if none of them won on their turns.\n\nSo, the probability would be the probability that Alice doesn't win, and Bob doesn't win, and Carol doesn't win.\n\nSo, it's (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/4) = (1/2) * (2/3) * (3/4) = (1*2*3)/(2*3*4) = 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 1/12.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to distinguish between the game ending because Carol wins on her turn versus the game ending because all three players have had their turns without anyone winning.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the probability that the game ends after all three players have had their turns?\"\n\nIf the game ends as soon as someone wins, then the only way for the game to proceed to all three players having their turns is if neither Alice nor Bob wins on their turns, and then Carol either wins or doesn't win.\n\nBut the problem seems to be specifying that the game ends after all three have had their turns, which would imply that none of them won on their turns, and then the game ends.\n\nWait, but if Carol wins on her turn, the game ends immediately, so the game only goes to Carol's turn if neither Alice nor Bob won on their turns, and then if Carol wins, the game ends on her turn.\n\nBut if Carol doesn't win on her turn, then according to the problem, each player gets only one turn, so if Carol doesn't win, the game ends without a winner.\n\nSo, in that case, the game ends after all three have had their turns either if Carol wins on her turn or if she doesn't win.\n\nWait, but the problem is specifying \"the game ends after all three players have had their turns.\"\n\nSo, perhaps it's asking for the probability that the game proceeds to all three players having their turns, which only happens if neither Alice nor Bob wins on their turns.\n\nThen, regardless of whether Carol wins or not, the game ends after her turn.\n\nSo, the probability that the game ends after all three have had their turns would be the probability that neither Alice nor Bob wins on their turns.\n\nSo, that would be (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) = (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3.\n\nBut earlier I thought about including Carol's probability, but perhaps not.\n\nWait, if neither Alice nor Bob wins, then Carol gets a turn, and regardless of whether she wins or not, the game ends after her turn.\n\nSo, the probability that the game ends after all three have had their turns is the probability that neither Alice nor Bob wins, which is (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the game ends after all three have had their turns, regardless of whether Carol wins or not, then it's the probability that neither Alice nor Bob wins, and then Carol either wins or doesn't win, but the game ends anyway.\n\nSo, in this case, it's still (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3.\n\nBut earlier I thought about including Carol's winning probability, but perhaps it's not necessary because the game ends after her turn regardless of whether she wins or not.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation, I had (1/2) * (2/3) * (3/4) = 1/4, but that included the probability that Carol doesn't win, which might not be relevant if the game ends after her turn anyway.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct probability is indeed 1/3.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nThe game can end in several ways:\n\n1. Alice wins on her turn: probability 1/2.\n\n2. Alice doesn't win, and Bob wins on his turn: (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6.\n\n3. Neither Alice nor Bob wins, and Carol wins on her turn: (1/2) * (2/3) * (1/4) = 1/12.\n\n4. Neither Alice nor Bob nor Carol wins: (1/2) * (2/3) * (3/4) = 1/4.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability that the game ends after all three players have had their turns.\n\nLooking at the above scenarios:\n\n- In case 1, the game ends after Alice's turn.\n\n- In case 2, it ends after Bob's turn.\n\n- In case 3, it ends after Carol's turn.\n\n- In case 4, it ends after Carol's turn without a winner.\n\nSo, cases 3 and 4 are scenarios where the game ends after all three have had their turns.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of cases 3 and 4, which is 1/12 + 1/4 = 1/12 + 3/12 = 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability that the game ends after all three players have had their turns is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, since the game ends after all three have had their turns only if neither Alice nor Bob wins on their turns, which is (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3, regardless of what Carol does.\n\nSo, both ways, I arrive at 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
