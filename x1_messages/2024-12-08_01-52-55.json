        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field with a length of 150 meters and a width of 80 meters. The farmer wants to plant crops in rows that are evenly spaced 2 meters apart. We need to find out how many rows he can plant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what is meant by \"rows that are evenly spaced 2 meters apart.\" I think this means that from the beginning to the end of the field, along the width, there will be rows separated by 2 meters each.\n\nSo, the width of the field is 80 meters, and the rows are spaced 2 meters apart. To find out how many rows can be planted, I should divide the width by the spacing between the rows.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of rows = width / spacing\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNumber of rows = 80 meters / 2 meters\n\nNumber of rows = 40\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there's anything else to consider. Maybe I need to consider the direction of the rows. Are the rows planted along the length or the width?\n\nLet me see. If the rows are planted along the length, that means they would be 150 meters long, and the spacing would be along the width.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the width is 80 meters, and rows are spaced 2 meters apart across the width.\n\nSo, dividing 80 by 2 gives 40. But I need to think about how rows are arranged. If the first row is at the starting edge, then each subsequent row is 2 meters away from the previous one.\n\nSo, the positions of the rows would be at 0 meters, 2 meters, 4 meters, and so on, up to 80 meters.\n\nWait, but at 80 meters, would there be a row? Let's see.\n\nIf the first row is at 0 meters, then the last row would be at 78 meters, because 0, 2, 4, ..., 78 meters, which is 39 intervals of 2 meters, making 40 rows.\n\nWait, but 0 to 78 is 39 intervals of 2 meters, because each interval is between two rows.\n\nLet me calculate it differently.\n\nNumber of rows = (width / spacing) + 1\n\nWait, no. That's not correct. Actually, the number of rows is equal to the number of intervals plus one.\n\nSo, if the width is 80 meters and the spacing is 2 meters, then the number of intervals is 80 / 2 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the number of rows is 40 + 1 = 41.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nImagine a smaller example. Suppose the width is 2 meters and the spacing is 2 meters.\n\nThen, there would be rows at 0 meters and 2 meters, which is 2 rows.\n\nSo, number of rows = (width / spacing) + 1\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nIn this case, width is 80 meters, spacing is 2 meters.\n\nNumber of rows = (80 / 2) + 1 = 40 + 1 = 41\n\nAlternatively, think about it as the number of positions including both ends.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 41 rows.\n\nBut let me confirm this with the initial straightforward approach.\n\nIf width is 80 meters and rows are spaced 2 meters apart, then the positions are 0, 2, 4, ..., up to 80 meters.\n\nTo find the number of terms in this sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nLast term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n80 = 0 + (n - 1) * 2\n\nSolving for n:\n\n80 = (n - 1) * 2\n\n40 = n - 1\n\nn = 41\n\nYes, that confirms it. There are 41 rows.\n\nSo, the farmer can plant 41 rows of crops in his field.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41} \\]"
