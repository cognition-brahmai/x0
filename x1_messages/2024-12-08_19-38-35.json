        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. So, the store is offering a 20% discount on an item that costs $250 originally. Then, on top of that, the customer has a coupon for an additional 10% off after the initial discount. We need to find out the final price the customer will pay.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the 20% discount on $250. To find 20% of $250, I can multiply 250 by 0.20.\n\n250 * 0.20 = 50\n\nSo, the first discount is $50. Now, subtract that from the original price:\n\n250 - 50 = 200\n\nNow, the price is $200 after the first discount. Next, the customer has a coupon for an additional 10% off. I need to find 10% of $200.\n\n200 * 0.10 = 20\n\nSo, the additional discount is $20. Subtract that from the already discounted price:\n\n200 - 20 = 180\n\nTherefore, the final price the customer will pay is $180.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes, with percentages, it's easy to get confused about whether to apply them sequentially or all at once. But in this case, it's clear: first, a 20% discount, then an additional 10% off the already discounted price.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the item's price being multiplied by 0.80 (which is 100% - 20%) and then by 0.90 (which is 100% - 10%).\n\nSo, starting with $250:\n\n250 * 0.80 = 200\n\nThen,\n\n200 * 0.90 = 180\n\nSame result, $180.\n\nI think that's correct. But to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret the discounts.\n\nSometimes, stores might apply both discounts simultaneously, meaning they combine the percentages. But in this case, it's specified that it's a 20% discount followed by an additional 10% off after the initial discount. So, it's sequential: first 20%, then 10% off the new price.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the overall discount. The first discount is 20%, and then an additional 10% on the discounted price. So, the total discount isn't simply 30%, because the second discount is applied to the already discounted price.\n\nLet me verify that. If I were to add the discounts directly:\n\n20% + 10% = 30%\n\nAnd then apply 30% off $250:\n\n250 * 0.30 = 75\n\n250 - 75 = 175\n\nBut earlier, I got $180, which is different from $175. So, adding the percentages directly is incorrect in this scenario.\n\nWhy is that? Because the additional 10% is applied to the already discounted price of $200, not to the original $250. So, it's not a cumulative 30% off the original price, but rather 20% off followed by 10% off the reduced price.\n\nTo generalize, if you have multiple successive percentage discounts, you can't just add them up. Each discount is applied to the price after the previous discount has been subtracted.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Suppose I calculate the combined discount factor. The first discount is 20%, which is equivalent to paying 80% of the original price. Then, an additional 10% off on that amount is equivalent to paying 90% of the already discounted price.\n\nSo, the overall discount factor is:\n\n0.80 * 0.90 = 0.72\n\nNow, multiply the original price by this combined discount factor:\n\n250 * 0.72 = 180\n\nAgain, $180. This matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if the discounts were applied simultaneously, meaning a total discount of 30% off the original price, then:\n\n250 * 0.70 = 175\n\nBut that's not the case here, as the discounts are applied sequentially.\n\nTo ensure I'm not missing anything, let's think about the order of operations. Does it matter if I apply the 10% coupon first and then the 20% discount? Let's see.\n\nIf the coupon is applied first, which is 10% off the original $250:\n\n250 * 0.10 = 25\n\n250 - 25 = 225\n\nThen, apply the 20% discount on $225:\n\n225 * 0.20 = 45\n\n225 - 45 = 180\n\nAgain, $180. So, regardless of the order in which the discounts are applied, the final price is the same.\n\nThat's good to know. It seems that when discounts are applied multiplicatively, the order doesn't affect the final price.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors to consider, such as tax. But the question doesn't mention tax, so I assume it's not relevant here. If tax were to be applied, it would be on the final discounted price, but since it's not mentioned, I'll proceed without considering tax.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the coupons and discounts are applicable to the item. But again, the question states that the store offers a 20% discount and the customer has an additional 10% off coupon, so I assume both apply to the item in question.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the coupon is applied before or after taxes, but since there are no taxes in this scenario, it's not an issue.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if the coupon has any usage restrictions, like a minimum purchase amount or exclusions on certain items. But since the question doesn't mention any restrictions, I'll assume it's applicable to this purchase.\n\nSo, to summarize, the original price is $250. A 20% discount is applied first, reducing the price to $200. Then, an additional 10% off coupon is applied to the $200, reducing it further to $180.\n\nTherefore, the final price the customer will pay is $180.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But to be absolutely sure, let me try calculating it another way.\n\nSuppose the combined discount is not 30%, but rather the product of the discount factors, as I did earlier: 0.80 * 0.90 = 0.72, and 250 * 0.72 = 180.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total discount percentage.\n\nThe first discount is 20%, and the second is 10% off the already discounted price.\n\nSo, the total discount is 20% plus 10% of the remaining 80%.\n\nThat is: 20% + (10% of 80%) = 20% + 8% = 28%.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the second discount is 10% off the price after the first discount. So, it's 10% of 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, total discount is 20% plus 10% of 80%:\n\n20% + (10% * 80%) = 20% + 8% = 28%.\n\nBut 28% of $250 is:\n\n250 * 0.28 = 70\n\n250 - 70 = 180\n\nAgain, $180. So, this matches my previous calculations.\n\nWait, earlier I thought about adding the discounts directly: 20% + 10% = 30%, but that's incorrect in this scenario. The correct way is to consider the second discount applied to the already discounted price, which effectively makes it 28% total discount, leading to a final price of $180.\n\nAlternatively, considering the combined discount factor of 0.80 * 0.90 = 0.72, which is equivalent to paying 72% of the original price, also resulting in $180.\n\nSo, all these methods confirm that the final price is $180.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles and confirmed the answer through multiple approaches. There doesn't seem to be any ambiguity in the question, and the calculations are straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the final price the customer will pay is $180.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
