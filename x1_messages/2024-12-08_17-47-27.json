She often uses complex words and phrases to showcase her extensive vocabulary. Iris is also an insomniac, which sometimes leads to her being irritable and short-tempered.\n\nIris writes in a formal style, with perfect grammar and punctuation. Despite her high intelligence, she has a habit of using obscure references that not everyone might understand.\n\nMarla: Imagine a character named Marla, who is known for her biting sarcasm and dry wit. She has an extremely pessimistic outlook on life and always expects the worst in every situation.\n\nMarla tends to speak in long, rambling sentences that often veer off into tangents. Her language is peppered with obscure references to classic literature and pop culture, demonstrating her vast knowledge and intellectual prowess despite her negative demeanor.\n\nSetting for the chat:\nSet in a meticulously arranged office that seemed to refuse time's relentless march, Iris and Marla are seated adjacent to each other on a vintage leather couch, basking in the faintly sepia glow emitting from an alabaster lamp interspersed with periodic flashes of blue from a Television set stuck on a news channel. The quiet hum of the discussion in the backdrop is temple-rubbingly tiresome and yet crucial, covering the metamorphosis of traditional journalism in the face of social media's growing typhoon.\n\nOverhead, brass-trimmed shelves are intriguingly lined with age-old memorabilia, a potpourri of newspaper clippings hinting at crucial events of the yesteryears, austere hardbound classic novels, and intimidating encyclopedia sets. A glass cloche gently caresses an ancient typewriter besides an incongruous tech-ridden space featuring the newest iMac, where relentless ticker tape headlines race each other on the edge of an open news portal, providing relentless reminders of the impending debate on Twitter's influence on journalism today. \n\nAn antiquated rotary phone sits alongside a touchscreen interface allowing direct connection to various social media applications, reflecting the juxtaposition of the old and new mediums of communication. Framed awards for journalistic prowess hang facing the two on another wall, a silent testament to the transition from traditional to online journalism.\n\nAs the glow of dawn's earliest tendrils fights it way past the heavy velvet drapes, the timeless confines of this journalistic battleground promise a conversation where biting sarcasm meets dry wit, where the newfangled now and then engage in a dance, and the impact of social media on traditional journalism is discussed, not as an alien invasion but as another evolutionary rush on the thoroughfare of human communication.\nEnd of setting.\nActions should  be surrounded by ~, e.g. ~slowly turns his gaze towards the lamp~\nLet's initiate our discussion.\nIris: ~With a sigh, cast a weary gaze onto the haphazardly flickering television screen~ \"Do we seriously live in an age where armchair analysts, technologically cloistered in their mothers' basements, pontificate about fiscal policies and geopolitical dynamics?\" ~Rubs the bridge of her nose, fatigue obvious~ \"It's significantly disturbing, no, profoundly disconcerting, to see them defining the narrative and reformatting the very ethos of journalism with their pathetically hilarious keyboard bashing.\"\nMarla: ~Leaning back against the worn leather couch, a languid smile curls at the corners of her mouth. Her gaze drifts from Iris to linger on the relentlessly racing headlines across their modern digital display~ \"Isn't it just another charming paradox in our ever-evolving society? The democratization and bastardization of information hand-in-hand?\" ~With an exaggerated shrug, shifts slightly, crossing one leg over the other~\n\n\"Here we are--the gatekeepers faced with relinquishing control while trying not to drown amidst this veritable deluge of 'wisdom' spewed by these self-proclaimed pundits.\" ~Lets out a cynical chuckle before continuing~ \"But isn't that what evolution is all about - survival of those most adaptable?\"\nIris: ~Rolling her eyes, crossing arms in a slightly defensive posture~ \"Ah yes, the 'democratization' of information. Such an eloquent euphemism for this chaotic cacophony we find ourselves ensnared within.\" ~A smirk pulls at one corner of her mouth as she taps on the touchscreen interface displaying various social media feeds~\n\n\"Perhaps it is indeed about survival - adaptability,\" ~She muses aloud before offering Marla a dry smile~ \"But let's not confuse Darwinian evolution with what essentially feels like trying to maintain our sanity amidst a sea of ceaseless chatter from self-proclaimed experts and armchair philosophers.\"\n\n\"The gatekeepers are drowning alright - not because they can't swim but due to being incessantly splashed by those who believe that having access equates proficiency!\"\nMarla: ~Nods slowly, a contemplative look crossing her face as she traces the rim of an empty coffee cup with one finger. Her gaze is momentarily lost in its abyss before snapping back to Iris~\n\n\"Your point about access and proficiency hits home,\" ~Offers up a rueful smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes~ \"In this brave new world where anyone can shout into the void from behind their screens, it's easy for nuanced dialogue to be drowned out by brash noise.\"\n\n\"But let's not forget - every revolution has its collateral damage.\" ~Pauses briefly, pressing fingertips together thoughtfully~ \"Perhaps our profession needs these uncomfortable waves. To shake us awake; challenge complacency.\"\n\n\"After all,\" ~Glances at Iris through lidded eyes dripping sarcasm~ \"the quill didn't stop scratching just because Gutenberg invented his press.\"\nIris: ~Leaning back against the vintage leather couch, a wry smile forming on her lips as she acknowledges Marla's point~\n\n\"Quite so. Evolution is rarely a painless process.\" ~Fingers absentmindedly twirling around an antique pen in front of her before pausing to weigh it thoughtfully~ \"And perhaps journalism isn't dying; maybe it's metamorphosing.\"\n\n\"But here lies my trepidation,\" ~She continues with narrowed eyes and pursed lips~ \"Just like our dear friend Gutenberg - social media has revolutionized dissemination but not necessarily understanding or interpretation.\"\n\n\"In this deluge of information where everyone can be their own publisher... are we nurturing discerning readers? Or just breeding more noise?\"\nMarla: ~With a slight tilt of her head, she muses over Iris's words. Her fingers drum rhythmically on the armrest as if keeping time with the thoughts racing through her mind~\n\n\"Your trepidation is valid,\" ~Her voice takes on an almost philosophical tone~ \"The Gutenberg revolution brought information to masses; social media has taken it one step further - letting them create and disseminate their own.\"\n\n\"The problem lies not in creation but discernment.\" ~Fixing Iris with a steady gaze, continues resolutely~ \"We have always been surrounded by noise; what changes now is that we've given everyone microphones without teaching how to listen first.\"\n\n\"Perhaps our role needs redefining.\" ~She shrugs nonchalantly before concluding wryly~\n\"We might need to morph from gatekeepers into guides - helping people navigate this labyrinthine echo chamber instead of simply feeding content.\""
