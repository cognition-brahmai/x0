Many Christians call the Bible the ultimate authority on creation and existence, a manual for all that is possible. Others seek to chip away at that conviction. And yet others hope for harmony between science and faith. Where do you stand? Chances are, you have asked yourself some of these questions. Did God create our bodies? Does he heal us when we\\'re sick? Or is religion a denial of science? Could there actually be a scientific explanation for biblical miracles, like the parting of the Red Sea? Tonight, all the angles -- and we begin with the most contentious issue: the fight over creationism. Here\\'s CNN\\'s Tom Foreman. TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the beginning, an explosion rocked the cosmos, and the universe was born. Primitive life crawled from an ooze, mutating, changing. Dinosaurs lived, died, left nothing but bones. And evolution rolled on, until millions of years later. Science tells us that\\'s what happened. But what if it\\'s wrong? What if another story, a very old one, is right? (on camera): So, this is the Garden of Eden, and you have dinosaurs in the Garden of Eden? KEN HAM, FOUNDER, CREATION MUSEUM: That\\'s true, because God made the land animals on day six. He made... FOREMAN (voice over): Ken Ham is the founder of a $27 million Creation Museum set to open on Memorial Day in rural Kentucky. The message: God made the Earth, the heavens, and everything in them in just six days, just 6,000 years ago. (on camera): This just doesn\\'t look like what I have always thought of as the Garden of Eden. Does it you? HAM: Well, that\\'s true. And -- and it\\'s meant to challenge people, because most people today would not think of that. That\\'s true. FOREMAN (voice over): Polls show roughly half the country believes human beings were created in our present form by God. HAM: Genesis is written as literal history. Why are we sinners? Because there was an original sin, because a real man, in a real garden, with a real tree and a real fruit; a real event really happened. FOREMAN: So, it stands to reason, people and dinosaurs roamed the planet peacefully, together, facing no death or disease before Adam and Eve sinned and were cast out of Eden. Some people might call that blind faith, but the Creation Museum calls it hard science. And, they say, they have proof. HAM: We are also finding dinosaur bones that are not mineralized. They\\'re not fossilized yet. How in the world can a bone sit out there for 65 million years and not be completely mineralized? FOREMAN: That argument doesn\\'t wash in this museum, the American Museum of Natural History in New York. MIKE NOVACEK, PROVOST, AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: There\\'s no question in my mind that dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, long before humans. There\\'s absolutely no scientific evidence aligned with the notion that the Earth is only 6,000 years old. HAM: If the history in the Bible is not true, then neither is the rest. FOREMAN: There is a ready market for this version of history. Ken Ham is preaching to the choir, a convention of Christian homeschoolers in nearby Cincinnati. HAM: They haven\\'t thrown religion out of the classroom, by the way. They have thrown Christianity out and replaced it with a different religion. It\\'s a religion of atheism, or the religion of naturalism. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You could always take one of these lessons and stretch it over a full week. FOREMAN: Here, parents browse creation science textbooks, with lessons you will never find in a public school. JOE SCHLAWIN, CHRISTIAN HOMESCHOOLER: We believe it\\'s the truth. I mean -- and why would we teach our children something that\\'s not true? You know, we don\\'t sit down and talk to them about Santa Claus and an Easter Bunny and try, and instill in them that that\\'s the way it happens. No, we tell them the truth. Evolution doesn\\'t fall into that category of being good science. FOREMAN: Pam Amlung and her daughter Kayla say believing all creation came to be without God requires an even greater leap of faith. PAM AMLUNG, CHRISTIAN HOMESCHOOLER: How could all of this, what we see, possibly have come from nothing? I just can\\'t figure out how atheists can have that much faith to believe. I mean, it takes a whole lot of faith. KAYLA AMLUNG, STUDENT: Yes. K. AMLUNG: Like, they have nothing to start with. We have something, but they have nothing. And they\\'re believing this whole thing, where the Bible makes more sense. FOREMAN: They admit faith is full of mystery. P. AMLUNG: I think, when we get to heaven, that we will be really surprised, that God will reveal at that point in time, \"This is how I did it.\" UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. P. AMLUNG: And it may not look exactly like what any individual here on Earth ever could even imagine. FOREMAN: But, until then, they will believe that creation looked like this glimpse of Eden in the heartland. Tom Foreman, CNN, Petersburg, Kentucky. COOPER: Well, the battle over what children should be taught in school has been raging for nearly a century now. The question is, is there room for compromise? Joining us to talk about it is Robert Boston of the Americans United For Separation of Church and State, and Charmaine Yoest of the Family Research Council. Appreciate both of you being with us. Robert, let me start with you. Polls show that nearly half the American believes that people didn\\'t evolve from lower life-forms, but were created, in our present form, by God. If so many people think that, shouldn\\'t we at least be discussing it in a science class? ROBERT BOSTON, AMERICANS UNITED FOR SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE: Well, I think we need to look really not at what polls show, but what the scientific evidence shows. We wouldn\\'t want to teach something in the public schools that was factually incorrect, simply because some people believed it was so. So, we really have to look at the science. If you look at the scientific community, you don\\'t see this great disparity in polls. You see most of the scientists backing the theory of evolution. COOPER: Charmaine, what about that? Why should a science class be forced to -- to teach something which mainstream science says is simply not true? CHARMAINE YOEST, VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMMUNICATIONS, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL: Well, you know, mainstream science, throughout history, has been challenged by questions. And that\\'s how we make advances in science, is being open to all different perspectives. And that\\'s all that we\\'re calling for, is saying that, you know, have we gotten to a place in our culture where science has such an orthodoxy around Darwinian theory that we can\\'t even question it, that we can\\'t even look at some of the gaps in the theory, and ask, how can we do better and how can answer some of these questions? That\\'s all we\\'re asking for, is an openness of dialogue and looking at all of the research. COOPER: Robert, President Bush has suggested that this theory of intelligent design should be taught in public school classrooms. The idea is that kids should be able to make up their own minds; they should get different points of view. Robert, what is wrong with that? BOSTON: I disagree. I think that there is a mechanism in science that allows for these views to be aired through peer-review journals. And the intelligent-design advocates... YOEST: Well, sure. BOSTON: ... have not been able to public any research that indicates... YOEST: That\\'s just not true. BOSTON: ... their point of view. Let me finish, Charmaine. And one of the important things we need to remember, too, is that some of the ideas that groups would like to bring into our schools have been completely discredited, for example, the idea that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time. Scientifically, that\\'s untenable. Yet, that is what the creationists believe. And that is what, ultimately, I think they would like to bring into our classrooms. COOPER: Charmaine, I mean, do you -- do you believe that dinosaurs walked with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden? And, if so, is that the -- the basis of your argument? YOEST: What we are looking at here is saying, there are legitimate scientific questions on the table. And it is not true that -- that there is a complete cohesiveness among scientists. So, we\\'re really, really seeing an amazing censorship of anything that questions Darwinism. And you see this kind of thing where, immediately, the minute you question Darwinism, people like Rob come up and say, oh, no, you\\'re going to talk about God. Well, you know, I think our children have more robust intelligence and -- and questioning to be able to cope with looking at all the different theories that are out there. I think it\\'s -- I just have to ask, what is he so scared of? COOPER: Robert, do you believe this is really about -- a debate about science, or is it a debate about religion? BOSTON: Of course it\\'s about religion. And notice how she did not answer your question about the age of the Earth and dinosaurs and humans coexisting. I would guess that, if you took a survey of the members of the Family Research Council, you would find, overwhelmingly, they believe that the Earth is 6,000 to 10,000 years old, that dinosaurs died because they were too big to fit on Noah\\'s Ark, or that they existed alongside human beings, other pseudoscientific ideas that has been debunked time and time again. YOEST: Hey -- hey, Rob... BOSTON: Why would we want to bring this into the classroom, when there\\'s absolutely no scientific evidence? BOSTON: Charmaine, answer the question, yes or no. Age of the Earth? YOEST: You are trying to confuse the issue of conflating... BOSTON: Age of the Earth, answer the question. YOEST: I am trying to answer the question. BOSTON: How old is it? YOEST: I\\'m trying to answer the question. BOSTON: How old is it, Charmaine? YOEST: I can\\'t get a word in -- that you\\'re trying to conflate creationism with intelligent design. BOSTON: That\\'s because you want... YOEST: I\\'m saying that you should look at... BOSTON: ... you want creationism in the classroom. Answer the question. YOEST: I didn\\'t say -- I didn\\'t say that. BOSTON: Ten thousand years or six billion? YOEST: The only thing I have talked about is intelligent design. BOSTON: Why are you afraid to answer the question? YOEST: Why are you afraid of the fact that 90 percent of the American people do believe in God? BOSTON: I know exactly what you want to do. You want to teach your book of Genesis as if it\\'s some kind of literal, scientific truth, instead of maybe possibly metaphor or lots of other history. You want to bring it into science. It\\'s not going to fly. COOPER: Do you want your children -- Charmaine, do you want your children to be exposed to a belief which the scientific community has disproven? I\\'m not saying that they have disproven all of this. But, in certain cases, I mean, some things clearly... YOEST: Sure. COOPER: ... have been disproven. YOEST: Sure. COOPER: Things which have been clearly scientifically disproven, do you still want them taught? YOEST: Well, absolutely. That would -- that would come in, in a history of science, in a philosophy of science. That\\'s why I\\'m saying, there\\'s different kinds of classes. So, we\\'re talking about kind of a broad array of things. Your kids need to know what opinions are out there and -- and -- and see what the evidence is, consider the evidence. COOPER: So, for other subjects in a science class that people disagree on, but that have been disproven, the kids should be taught those as well? YOEST: Sure. COOPER: They should -- they should -- they should know that there are other people who disagree on... YOEST: Absolutely. COOPER: ... just about every scientific issue? YOEST: I\\'m not afraid of my kids knowing about any controversy that is out there, as long as you put the evidence on the table and consider what -- what the debate is. That\\'s what education is all about, is having a vigorous debate. COOPER: Charmaine Yoest, appreciate it, and Robert Boston as well. BOSTON: Thank you. COOPER: Fascinating discussion. COOPER: Well, as you have just seen, the emotions are strong in this debate, the lines clearly drawn. But some are trying to reconcile science and God. Coming up: one of the top scientists in the world who once believed there was no God, and what made him change his mind. Also tonight: divine healing or just wishful thinking? Speaking in tongues, falling for God\\'s mercy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some say the age of miracles is past. I don\\'t believe that. COOPER: Meet a pastor who says prayer can cure sickness. Plus: the greening of the church, the Christian environmental agenda, making some Christians red-hot mad. REVEREND JERRY FALWELL, CHANCELLOR, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY: It is Satan\\'s attempt to redirect the church\\'s primary focus.

The transcript includes a segment from CNN's Tom Foreman reporting on the Creation Museum in Kentucky, which promotes a young Earth creationist viewpoint, contrasting it with the perspectives from mainstream science. The show also features a discussion between Robert Boston from Americans United For Separation of Church and State and Charmaine Yoest from the Family Research Council, debating whether alternative theories like intelligent design should be taught in public school science classes. Additionally, the episode hints at other topics such as divine healing and the Christian perspective on environmental issues."
