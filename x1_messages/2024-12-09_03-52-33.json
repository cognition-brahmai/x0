        "content": "Let's see. I have this question about the Spanish language and its literature. So, first, it says that Spanish is a Romance language that evolved from Latin, and it has a complex grammatical structure. It uses prepositions and postpositions, has many verb tenses, and word order is important for meaning. Then, it mentions that Miguel de Cervantes is really important, especially his work \"Don Quixote,\" and that there was a Golden Age in Spanish literature during the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nNow, I have to choose which statement is most accurate based on this info. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Spanish evolved from Greek and has a simple grammatical structure.\n\nWell, the text says Spanish evolved from Latin, not Greek. And it's described as having a complex grammatical structure, not a simple one. So, this statement is incorrect on both counts.\n\nB. Word order is not important in Spanish.\n\nBut the text explicitly says that Spanish places a strong emphasis on word order for meaning. So, this statement is directly contradicted by the information provided.\n\nC. The works of Miguel de Cervantes are not significant in Spanish literature.\n\nThe text clearly states that Cervantes' works, particularly \"Don Quixote,\" are considered seminal in Spanish literature. So, this statement is also incorrect.\n\nD. The Golden Age was a period of prolific literary production in Spain.\n\nThis matches exactly with what the text says: \"The literature of Spain is also marked by the Golden Age, a period of prolific literary production in the 16th and 17th centuries.\"\n\nSo, based on the information provided, statement D is the most accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
