        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says that the original length is 12 inches and the width is 8 inches. Then, it tells me to increase the length by 50% and decrease the width by 25%, and I need to find out what the new area will be after these changes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to increase the length by 50%. If the original length is 12 inches, increasing it by 50% means I'm adding half of its original length to itself. So, half of 12 inches is 6 inches. Therefore, the new length should be 12 inches plus 6 inches, which is 18 inches.\n\nNext, decreasing the width by 25%. The original width is 8 inches. 25% of 8 inches is 2 inches. So, decreasing the width by 2 inches means the new width will be 8 inches minus 2 inches, which is 6 inches.\n\nNow, to find the area of a rectangle, I know that area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, with the new dimensions, the area should be the new length times the new width, which is 18 inches times 6 inches.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 18 times 6 is 108. So, the new area should be 108 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, increasing the length by 50%: 50% of 12 is indeed 6, and 12 plus 6 is 18. That seems correct.\n\nThen, decreasing the width by 25%: 25% of 8 is 2, and 8 minus 2 is 6. That also seems correct.\n\nFinally, multiplying the new length and width: 18 times 6 is indeed 108. So, I think the new area is 108 square inches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach the problem differently. Perhaps I can calculate the area before and after the changes and see if it makes sense.\n\nOriginal area is length times width, which is 12 times 8, which is 96 square inches.\n\nNow, increasing the length by 50% and decreasing the width by 25%. Instead of calculating the new dimensions separately, maybe I can think about how the area changes directly.\n\nIf I increase the length by 50%, that's like multiplying the length by 1.5. Decreasing the width by 25% is like multiplying the width by 0.75. So, the new area should be the original area times 1.5 times 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate that: 96 times 1.5 is 144, and 144 times 0.75 is 108. So, again, I get 108 square inches.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems definite that the new area is 108 square inches.\n\nJust to explore a bit more, I wonder if there's a general formula for this kind of problem. Like, if you have a rectangle with length L and width W, and you increase the length by a certain percentage and decrease the width by another percentage, how does that affect the area?\n\nIn general, if you increase the length by a percentage, you're multiplying the length by (1 + the percentage in decimal form). Similarly, decreasing the width by a percentage is multiplying the width by (1 - the percentage in decimal form).\n\nSo, the new area would be L*(1 + P) times W*(1 - Q), where P is the percentage increase for length and Q is the percentage decrease for width, both in decimal form.\n\nIn this case, P is 0.50 and Q is 0.25. So, new area is L*1.5 * W*0.75 = 1.5*0.75*L*W = 1.125*L*W.\n\nSo, the new area is 1.125 times the original area. Since the original area is 96 square inches, 1.125 times 96 is indeed 108 square inches.\n\nThis is consistent with my previous calculations. It's good to see that different approaches lead to the same answer, which reinforces that 108 square inches is correct.\n\nI think that's all I need to do for this problem. The new area of the rectangle after increasing the length by 50% and decreasing the width by 25% is 108 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]"
