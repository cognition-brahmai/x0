        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the car factory produces 20 cars every hour. We need to find out how many cars it produces in a whole week. To do that, we'll need to figure out how many hours the factory operates in a week and then multiply that by the production rate per hour.\n\nFirst, we should assume that the factory operates continuously without any breaks, unless specified otherwise. So, typically, there are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of hours in a week would be:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 168 hours/week\n\nNow, if the factory produces 20 cars every hour, then in 168 hours, it would produce:\n\n20 cars/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = 3360 cars/week\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe the factory doesn't operate 24/7. Perhaps it has shifts or downtime. But the problem doesn't specify any breaks or downtime, so it's safe to assume it operates continuously.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes factories might operate in shifts, like two 12-hour shifts per day, with crew changes. If that's the case, then the operating hours per day would be 12 hours \u00d7 2 shifts = 24 hours, which is the same as continuous operation.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation:\n\n20 cars/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = 3360 cars/week\n\nLet me verify this again. If the factory makes 20 cars every hour and operates for 168 hours in a week, then multiplying those should give the total weekly production.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the daily production first and then multiply by 7 for the number of days in a week.\n\nDaily production:\n\n20 cars/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 480 cars/day\n\nThen, weekly production:\n\n480 cars/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 3360 cars/week\n\nSame result. So, it seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect production, like maintenance time, worker breaks, or machinery downtime. But since the problem doesn't mention any of these, we'll assume perfect operation without any interruptions.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 3360 cars in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3360} \\]"
