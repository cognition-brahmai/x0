        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 houses in a row, each with one child, and the number of toys each child has corresponds to their house number. That means:\n\n- House 1: 1 toy\n\n- House 2: 2 toys\n\n- House 3: 3 toys\n\n- House 4: 4 toys\n\n- House 5: 5 toys\n\n- House 6: 6 toys\n\n- House 7: 7 toys\n\n- House 8: 8 toys\n\n- House 9: 9 toys\n\n- House 10: 10 toys\n\nNow, a new family moves into an empty house between two existing houses, and their child has 5 toys. The question is, how many children now have fewer toys than the new child?\n\nFirst, I need to understand where this new house is being added. The problem says \"between two existing houses,\" so the new house isn't at either end; it's somewhere in the middle.\n\nBut actually, wait a minute, the problem says \"between two existing houses,\" but in a row of 10 houses, if we're adding one more house, it could potentially be between any two existing houses or possibly at one of the ends, depending on the exact interpretation. However, the problem specifies \"between two existing houses,\" which suggests it's not at the ends.\n\nSo, let's assume the new house is inserted between two existing houses, say between house i and house i+1, where i ranges from 1 to 9.\n\nBut actually, the exact position might not matter for this particular question, because the number of toys each child has is based on their house number, and the new child has 5 toys, regardless of where the house is added.\n\nThe question is asking how many children now have fewer toys than the new child. The new child has 5 toys, so we need to count how many children have fewer than 5 toys.\n\nLooking back at the original distribution:\n\n- House 1: 1 toy (fewer than 5)\n\n- House 2: 2 toys (fewer than 5)\n\n- House 3: 3 toys (fewer than 5)\n\n- House 4: 4 toys (fewer than 5)\n\n- House 5: 5 toys (not fewer than 5)\n\n- House 6: 6 toys (not fewer than 5)\n\n- ...\n\n- House 10: 10 toys (not fewer than 5)\n\nSo, originally, houses 1 through 4 have fewer than 5 toys.\n\nNow, a new child with 5 toys is added. This doesn't change the number of toys the other children have; it just adds one more child with 5 toys.\n\nSo, the children with fewer toys than the new child (which has 5 toys) are still those with fewer than 5 toys, which are the children in houses 1 through 4.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 children who have fewer toys than the new child.\n\nWait a second, but the new child has 5 toys, and the problem is asking for children with fewer toys than the new child. So, the new child doesn't have fewer toys than themselves; they have equal number of toys.\n\nBut the question is about children who have fewer toys than the new child, so the new child isn't included in that count.\n\nTherefore, the answer should still be 4.\n\nHowever, perhaps I should consider if the new child affects the toy distribution in some way, but the problem states that the new child has 5 toys, and the other children's toy counts remain the same.\n\nSo, no, the addition of the new child doesn't change the number of toys the existing children have; it just adds one more child with 5 toys.\n\nTherefore, the number of children with fewer toys than the new child remains 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies that the new house is assigned a house number, and the child's toy count is based on the house number, but the problem states that the new child has 5 toys, so perhaps it's an exception.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it seems the new child has 5 toys regardless of the house number.\n\nSo, my final answer is that 4 children now have fewer toys than the new child.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
