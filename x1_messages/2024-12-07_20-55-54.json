        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a man has 12 coins, some of which are fake. If he randomly picks one coin, the probability of getting a fake coin is 1/3. I need to figure out how many of those coins are fake.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what probability means in this context. Probability is basically the likelihood of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking a fake coin, and the total number of possible outcomes is picking any coin, whether it's fake or real.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a fake coin is the number of fake coins divided by the total number of coins.\n\nThe problem states that this probability is 1/3, and the total number of coins is 12.\n\nLet's denote the number of fake coins as F.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of picking a fake coin is F divided by 12.\n\nSo, P = F / 12.\n\nBut we know that P is 1/3, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1/3 = F / 12.\n\nNow, to find F, I can solve this equation by cross-multiplying.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12, I get:\n\nF = (1/3) * 12.\n\nCalculating that, F = 4.\n\nSo, there are 4 fake coins out of the 12 coins.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 4 fake coins out of 12, then the probability of picking a fake coin would indeed be 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using percentages or something else, but I think this straightforward probability approach is the most straightforward method.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trick or additional layer to this problem. The problem says \"some of which are fake,\" and gives the probability of picking a fake coin as 1/3. It seems pretty straightforward; there's no mention of multiple picks or conditional probabilities, so I think the answer is simply 4 fake coins.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's imagine if there were more fake coins. For example, if there were 5 fake coins, the probability would be 5/12, which is greater than 1/3. Similarly, if there were 3 fake coins, it would be 3/12 = 1/4, which is less than 1/3. So, indeed, 4 fake coins give the exact probability of 1/3.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. The answer is 4 fake coins.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
