        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a car travels 400 miles on a full tank of gas, which holds 16 gallons. I need to figure out how many miles the car can travel on just 3 gallons of gas. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the miles traveled and the gallons of gas used. It seems like the car can go 400 miles on 16 gallons. So, maybe I can find out how many miles it can go per gallon, and then use that to find out for 3 gallons.\n\nLet me try that. If 16 gallons allow for 400 miles, then per gallon, it should be 400 miles divided by 16 gallons. Let me do that calculation: 400 divided by 16. Hmm, 16 times 25 is 400, so 400 divided by 16 is 25 miles per gallon.\n\nAlright, so the car gets 25 miles per gallon. Now, if I have 3 gallons, I can multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons to find out how far it can go. So, 25 miles per gallon times 3 gallons should give me the total miles.\n\nLet me calculate that: 25 times 3 is 75. So, the car can travel 75 miles on 3 gallons of gas.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. First, 400 miles on 16 gallons means 400 divided by 16 is 25 miles per gallon. That seems right. Then, 25 miles per gallon times 3 gallons is 75 miles. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as setting up a proportion. If 16 gallons correspond to 400 miles, then 3 gallons correspond to x miles. So, I can set up the proportion: 16 gallons is to 400 miles as 3 gallons is to x miles. In mathematical terms, that's 16/400 = 3/x.\n\nWait, actually, that should be 16 gallons : 400 miles = 3 gallons : x miles, which is 16/400 = 3/x. But actually, it's better to think of it as miles per gallon to make it clearer.\n\nAlternatively, I can set it up as gallons to miles: gallons/miles = constant, if the car's fuel efficiency is constant.\n\nSo, 16 gallons correspond to 400 miles, so the ratio is 16/400 or 400/16, depending on which way I set it up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the concept of proportionality more carefully.\n\nLet me think again. If 16 gallons allow for 400 miles, then 1 gallon would allow for 400 divided by 16 miles, which is 25 miles per gallon, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, 3 gallons would allow for 3 times 25 miles, which is 75 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if I set up the proportion as gallons to miles, it should be 16 gallons is to 400 miles as 3 gallons is to x miles. So, 16/400 = 3/x.\n\nWait, is that the correct set-up? Let me think about the proportion.\n\nActually, in proportions, if a/b = c/d, then a*d = b*c.\n\nSo, if 16 gallons correspond to 400 miles, and 3 gallons correspond to x miles, then 16/400 = 3/x.\n\nCross-multiplying, 16*x = 400*3, so 16x = 1200.\n\nThen, x = 1200 divided by 16, which is 75 miles.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same answer: 75 miles.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of unit rates. The car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, for every gallon, the car can go 25 miles. Therefore, for 3 gallons, it's 3 times 25, which is 75 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the total miles being proportional to the amount of gas, then again, 3 gallons is 3/16 of the full tank.\n\nSince the full tank allows for 400 miles, 3/16 of the tank should allow for 3/16 of 400 miles.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3/16 * 400 = (3*400)/16 = 1200/16 = 75 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The car can travel 75 miles on 3 gallons of gas.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor I might have missed, like different fuel efficiencies at different tank levels or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 75 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
