        "content": "Okay, I'm going to try to make a simple text editor in C++. I've never done this before, but I think it's a good challenge. So, first things first, I need to understand what a text editor does. From what I know, a text editor should allow users to write text, edit it, and save it to a file. So, in this case, I need to create a program that can handle these operations.\n\nI should probably start by planning out the features and how I want the program to work. Since it's a basic text editor, I don't need anything too fancy. The essential operations are:\n\n1. Adding text: Users should be able to input text into the editor.\n\n2. Deleting text: Users should be able to remove text from the editor.\n\n3. Saving to disk: Users should be able to save the current text to a file.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider error handling to make sure the program doesn't crash if something goes wrong, like trying to save a file with an invalid name or running out of disk space.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the program. Since it's command-line based, I'll need to handle user inputs through the console. I can use a loop that keeps running until the user decides to exit. Inside the loop, I'll present options to the user like \"Add text\", \"Delete text\", \"Save file\", and \"Exit\". Based on the user's choice, I'll perform the corresponding operation.\n\nFor storing the text, I can use a string or a vector of strings. Using a vector might be better because it can handle larger amounts of text more efficiently. Each element in the vector can represent a line of text.\n\nLet's sketch out a rough outline of the program:\n\n1. Initialize an empty vector to store the text lines.\n\n2. Display a menu with options:\n\n- Add text\n\n- Delete text\n\n- Save file\n\n- Exit\n\n3. Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding operation:\n\n- Add text: Prompt the user to enter text and add it to the vector.\n\n- Delete text: Prompt the user for the line number to delete and remove that line from the vector.\n\n- Save file: Prompt for a filename and write the vector contents to that file.\n\n- Exit: Save any changes and quit the program.\n\nI need to make sure that the program handles errors gracefully. For example, if the user tries to delete a line that doesn't exist, I should display an error message instead of crashing.\n\nLet me consider how to implement each operation in more detail.\n\nAdding text:\n\n- Prompt the user to enter the text they want to add.\n\n- Read the input and append it to the vector.\n\n- Optionally, allow adding text at a specific position.\n\nDeleting text:\n\n- Prompt the user for the line number they want to delete.\n\n- Validate the line number to ensure it's within the vector's bounds.\n\n- If valid, remove the line; otherwise, display an error message.\n\nSaving to disk:\n\n- Prompt the user for a filename.\n\n- Open the file in write mode.\n\n- Write each line of the vector to the file, adding newline characters as needed.\n\n- Handle any file I/O errors, like permission issues or full disk.\n\nExiting:\n\n- Optionally, prompt the user if they want to save changes before exiting.\n\n- If yes, perform the save operation.\n\n- Then, exit the program.\n\nI should also think about how to handle multiple file operations, like opening an existing file, but since this is a basic editor, I'll focus on creating a new file for now.\n\nLet me start by writing some pseudocode to get a better idea.\n\nInitialize text_lines as an empty vector of strings.\n\nDisplay menu:\n\nPrint \"1. Add text\"\n\nPrint \"2. Delete text\"\n\nPrint \"3. Save file\"\n\nPrint \"4. Exit\"\n\nRead user choice.\n\nBased on choice:\n\nIf 1:\n\nPrint \"Enter text to add:\"\n\nRead input and add to text_lines.\n\nIf 2:\n\nPrint \"Enter line number to delete:\"\n\nRead line_number.\n\nIf line_number is valid:\n\nDelete line from text_lines.\n\nElse:\n\nPrint \"Invalid line number.\"\n\nIf 3:\n\nPrint \"Enter filename to save:\"\n\nRead filename.\n\nOpen file for writing.\n\nIf file opens successfully:\n\nWrite text_lines to file.\n\nClose file.\n\nElse:\n\nPrint error message.\n\nIf 4:\n\nExit program.\n\nWait, I should probably put this menu in a loop so that the user can perform multiple operations without restarting the program.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I'll use a while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit.\n\nI should also think about how to handle line numbering for deletion. Since vectors are zero-indexed in C++, but humans count lines starting from 1, I need to adjust for that. So, if the user says line 1, it corresponds to index 0 in the vector.\n\nAdditionally, I should display the current text content to the user so they can see what they're working with. Maybe after each operation, I can print the current text.\n\nLet me think about the user experience. It would be helpful to have an option to view the current text without saving or modifying it.\n\nHmm, maybe I should add a \"View text\" option to the menu.\n\nUpdated menu:\n\n1. Add text\n\n2. Delete text\n\n3. View text\n\n4. Save file\n\n5. Exit\n\nThat way, users can see what they've entered so far.\n\nAlso, for adding text, I should consider whether to append to the end or insert at a specific position. To keep it simple, I'll start with appending to the end.\n\nFor deleting text, I'll allow specifying the line number to delete. Later, I can think about deleting multiple lines or ranges.\n\nI should also handle cases where the vector is empty, to avoid errors when trying to delete lines or view text.\n\nLet me start outlining the code structure.\n\nInclude necessary headers:\n\n- iostream for input/output\n\n- vector for storing text lines\n\n- fstream for file operations\n\nUsing namespace std;\n\nDefine the main function.\n\nInside main:\n\n- Initialize vector<string> text_lines;\n\n- Display menu in a loop until user chooses to exit.\n\n- Read user choice using cin.\n\n- Based on choice, perform operations.\n\nFor adding text:\n\n- Use getline(cin, input) to read possibly multi-line input.\n\n- Add input to text_lines.\n\nFor deleting text:\n\n- Read line_number from user.\n\n- Convert to integer.\n\n- Check if line_number-1 is within vector bounds.\n\n- If yes, erase that line using vector's erase function.\n\n- Else, display error.\n\nFor viewing text:\n\n- Iterate through text_lines and print each line with its line number.\n\nFor saving file:\n\n- Read filename from user.\n\n- Open file in write mode using ofstream.\n\n- If file opens successfully, write each line in text_lines to the file.\n\n- Handle file I/O errors.\n\nFor exiting:\n\n- Break the loop to exit the program.\n\nI should also handle invalid menu choices by displaying an error message and prompting again.\n\nLet me think about how to handle multi-line input for adding text. C++'s getline function can read a whole line, including spaces, but if I want to allow multiple lines, I might need a different approach.\n\nOne way is to read lines one by one until the user indicates they're done, maybe by entering a specific delimiter like \"END\" or an empty line.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll start by allowing single-line input for adding text. Later, I can enhance it to handle multi-line input.\n\nSimilarly, for deleting text, I'll start by allowing deletion of a single line specified by its line number.\n\nI should also consider that if a user deletes a line, the line numbers of subsequent lines change. So, after deletion, if the user wants to delete another line, the line numbers are updated.\n\nBut for this basic version, I'll assume that the user won't need to delete multiple lines in a single session.\n\nWait, no, I should make sure that after each deletion, the line numbers are updated correctly.\n\nAlso, when viewing the text, I should display line numbers starting from 1.\n\nLet me write some sample code to see how this would look.\n\nFor viewing text:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < text_lines.size(); i++) {\n\ncout << i+1 << \": \" << text_lines[i] << endl;\n\n}\n\nThat should work.\n\nFor deleting text:\n\nint line_number;\n\ncout << \"Enter line number to delete: \";\n\ncin >> line_number;\n\nif(line_number > 0 && line_number <= text_lines.size()) {\n\ntext_lines.erase(text_lines.begin() + line_number - 1);\n\n} else {\n\ncout << \"Invalid line number.\" << endl;\n\n}\n\ncin.ignore(); // To consume the newline character left in the input buffer.\n\nWait, why is cin.ignore() needed?\n\nBecause after reading the integer line_number, there's a newline character left in the input buffer, which can cause issues if the next operation expects input.\n\nSo, it's a good practice to use cin.ignore() after reading with cin.\n\nAlso, I should consider that if the user enters something that's not an integer for line_number, cin >> line_number will fail, and I need to handle that.\n\nI can check if the input was successful and prompt the user again if it was not.\n\nSimilarly, for reading filenames and text inputs, I need to handle non-integer inputs.\n\nTo make the program more robust, I should validate user inputs and handle errors appropriately.\n\nLet me think about how to handle invalid inputs for menu choices.\n\nI can read the choice as a string and then try to convert it to an integer.\n\nIf conversion fails, display an error message.\n\nAlternatively, I can read the choice as an integer and handle failures.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the user enters valid integers for menu choices.\n\nFor more advanced error handling, I can add try-catch blocks or check the state of cin.\n\nBut for this basic version, I'll keep it simple.\n\nAnother consideration is that after performing an operation, I should clear the console screen to provide a cleaner interface.\n\nIn C++, I can use system(\"cls\") for Windows or system(\"clear\") for Unix-based systems to clear the console.\n\nBut using system calls is generally discouraged because it's not portable and can pose security risks.\n\nInstead, I can just print a bunch of newlines to scroll up the previous output.\n\nSo, I'll define a function to print, say, 50 newlines.\n\nvoid clear_screen() {\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n\ncout << endl;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThat should scroll up the previous content.\n\nAlternatively, I can use ANSI escape codes to clear the screen, but that might not work on all systems.\n\nFor now, I'll go with printing newlines.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of operations in the program.\n\n1. Display menu.\n\n2. Read user choice.\n\n3. Perform the chosen operation.\n\n4. Optionally, display the current text.\n\n5. Loop back to step 1.\n\nI should also think about how to handle saving the file.\n\nShould I overwrite the file each time or append to it?\n\nFor this basic version, I'll stick with overwriting the file.\n\nBut I should inform the user that the file will be overwritten if it already exists.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where the file cannot be opened for writing, such as permission issues or full disk.\n\nIn such cases, I should display an error message to the user.\n\nLet me consider how to implement the save operation.\n\nPrompt the user for the filename.\n\nThen, try to open the file in write mode using ofstream.\n\nIf the file opens successfully, iterate through text_lines and write each line to the file, followed by a newline.\n\nThen, close the file.\n\nIf there's an error opening or writing to the file, display an appropriate error message.\n\nAlso, after saving, I can inform the user that the file has been saved successfully.\n\nNow, about adding text.\n\nAs I thought earlier, starting with single-line input would be easier.\n\nBut to make it more user-friendly, I can allow multi-line input.\n\nOne way to do this is to read lines until the user enters a specific delimiter, like \"END\" or an empty line.\n\nFor example, the user can keep entering lines of text, and when they want to finish, they enter \"END\" on a separate line.\n\nThen, I can add all the lines entered between the last \"END\" and the current one.\n\nLet me try to implement that.\n\nWhen the user chooses to add text:\n\n- Print \"Enter text (type 'END' on a separate line to finish):\"\n\n- Read lines one by one using getline(cin, input)\n\n- If input is \"END\", stop reading and add the previous lines to text_lines.\n\n- Else, keep reading lines.\n\nBut this might add \"END\" itself to the text_lines, which I don't want.\n\nSo, I need to check if the input is \"END\" and only then stop reading.\n\nHere's some pseudocode:\n\nvector<string> new_lines;\n\nstring input;\n\ncout << \"Enter text (type 'END' on a separate line to finish):\" << endl;\n\nwhile(true) {\n\ngetline(cin, input);\n\nif(input == \"END\") {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\nnew_lines.push_back(input);\n\n}\n\ntext_lines.insert(text_lines.end(), new_lines.begin(), new_lines.end());\n\nThis way, \"END\" isn't added to the text_lines.\n\nThat seems good.\n\nI can use a similar approach for deleting multiple lines, but for now, I'll keep deletion to single lines.\n\nLet me think about the user interface.\n\nEach time the program starts or after each operation, I can display the current state of the text.\n\nFor example, after adding text or deleting a line, show the updated text.\n\nThis will help the user see the changes they've made.\n\nAlso, before saving, show the text that will be saved.\n\nBut that might be too much information if the text is large.\n\nMaybe I can provide an option to view the current text.\n\nAs I thought earlier, adding a \"View text\" option to the menu would be useful.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the code.\n\nSince it's a small program, I can keep everything in the main function.\n\nBut for better organization, I can define separate functions for each operation: add_text, delete_text, view_text, save_file.\n\nThis will make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\nLet me outline the functions:\n\nvoid add_text(vector<string>& text_lines) {\n\nvector<string> new_lines;\n\nstring input;\n\ncout << \"Enter text (type 'END' on a separate line to finish):\" << endl;\n\nwhile(true) {\n\ngetline(cin, input);\n\nif(input == \"END\") {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\nnew_lines.push_back(input);\n\n}\n\ntext_lines.insert(text_lines.end(), new_lines.begin(), new_lines.end());\n\n}\n\nvoid delete_text(vector<string>& text_lines) {\n\nint line_number;\n\ncout << \"Enter line number to delete: \";\n\nif(!(cin >> line_number)) {\n\ncout << \"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\" << endl;\n\ncin.clear();\n\ncin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nif(line_number > 0 && line_number <= text_lines.size()) {\n\ntext_lines.erase(text_lines.begin() + line_number - 1);\n\ncout << \"Line deleted successfully.\" << endl;\n\n} else {\n\ncout << \"Invalid line number.\" << endl;\n\n}\n\ncin.ignore();\n\n}\n\nvoid view_text(const vector<string>& text_lines) {\n\nif(text_lines.empty()) {\n\ncout << \"No text entered.\" << endl;\n\n} else {\n\nfor(size_t i = 0; i < text_lines.size(); i++) {\n\ncout << i+1 << \": \" << text_lines[i] << endl;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nvoid save_file(const vector<string>& text_lines) {\n\nstring filename;\n\ncout << \"Enter filename to save: \";\n\ngetline(cin, filename);\n\nofstream outfile(filename);\n\nif(outfile.is_open()) {\n\nfor(const auto& line : text_lines) {\n\noutfile << line << endl;\n\n}\n\noutfile.close();\n\ncout << \"File saved successfully.\" << endl;\n\n} else {\n\ncout << \"Error opening file for writing.\" << endl;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nIn the main function, I can display the menu and call these functions based on user choice.\n\nI should also handle the case where the user tries to save an empty text_lines vector.\n\nMaybe I should prompt them to confirm if they want to save an empty file.\n\nBut for now, I'll allow it, as sometimes users might want to create an empty file.\n\nI should also think about error handling in file operations.\n\nFor example, if the file cannot be opened due to permission issues, or if there's no space left on the disk.\n\nIn such cases, ofstream::is_open() will return false, and I can display an error message.\n\nSimilarly, if writing to the file fails, I should check outfile.good() after writing.\n\nBut for this basic version, checking if the file opened successfully should suffice.\n\nLet me think about how to handle large amounts of text.\n\nSince I'm using a vector of strings, it should handle a reasonable amount of text.\n\nBut if the text is too large, it might consume a lot of memory.\n\nTo handle very large files, I could read and write in chunks, but that's more complex and beyond the scope of this basic editor.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the text is small enough to fit into memory.\n\nAnother consideration is that when reading lines with getline, lines that are too long might not be handled properly.\n\nBut again, for a basic editor, I'll assume that lines aren't excessively long.\n\nIf needed, I can set a maximum line length or handle long lines differently.\n\nNow, let's think about the main loop.\n\nI can use a do-while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit.\n\nHere's a rough structure:\n\nint choice;\n\ndo {\n\n// Display menu\n\ncout << \"Menu:\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"1. Add text\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"2. Delete text\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"3. View text\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"4. Save file\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"5. Exit\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"Enter your choice: \";\n\ncin >> choice;\n\n// Clear the newline character left in the input buffer\n\ncin.ignore();\n\n// Perform the chosen operation\n\nswitch(choice) {\n\ncase 1:\n\nadd_text(text_lines);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 2:\n\ndelete_text(text_lines);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 3:\n\nview_text(text_lines);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 4:\n\nsave_file(text_lines);\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 5:\n\ncout << \"Exiting...\" << endl;\n\nbreak;\n\ndefault:\n\ncout << \"Invalid choice. Please try again.\" << endl;\n\n}\n\n// Optionally, clear the screen or print newlines to separate operations\n\n} while(choice != 5);\n\nThat should work.\n\nI should also consider that after choosing to view text or save file, the user might want to perform another operation immediately.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that the screen is cleared or that the output is separated clearly.\n\nI can define a function to print a separator or clear the screen between operations.\n\nAs I thought earlier, I'll just print a bunch of newlines to scroll up the previous output.\n\nLet me define a function for that.\n\nvoid clear_screen() {\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n\ncout << endl;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen, call this function before displaying the menu or after performing an operation.\n\nThis will help in keeping the console clean.\n\nBut in some environments, printing 50 newlines might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use cout << string(50, '\\n'); to print 50 newlines.\n\nThat might be more efficient.\n\nLet me update the clear_screen function.\n\nvoid clear_screen() {\n\ncout << string(50, '\\n');\n\n}\n\nBetter.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to call this function.\n\nPerhaps after each operation, before redisplaying the menu.\n\nThis will help separate different operations visually.\n\nLet me also think about how to handle errors in input.\n\nFor example, if the user enters a non-integer value for the menu choice or line number.\n\nIn such cases, cin >> choice will fail, and I need to handle that.\n\nI can check if cin.fail() and reset the input state if necessary.\n\nSimilarly, after a failed input, I need to clear the error state of cin and ignore the remaining input.\n\nHere's how I can handle it:\n\ndo {\n\nclear_screen();\n\n// Display menu\n\ncout << \"Menu:\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"1. Add text\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"2. Delete text\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"3. View text\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"4. Save file\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"5. Exit\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"Enter your choice: \";\n\nif(!(cin >> choice)) {\n\ncout << \"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\" << endl;\n\ncin.clear();\n\ncin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n// Wait for user to press enter before continuing\n\ncout << \"Press Enter to continue...\" << endl;\n\ncin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\ncontinue;\n\n}\n\ncin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n// Perform the chosen operation\n\nswitch(choice) {\n\n// ...\n\n}\n\n} while(choice != 5);\n\nThis way, if the input is invalid, I clear the input state, ignore the remaining input, display an error message, and wait for the user to press enter before redisplaying the menu.\n\nThis should handle most input errors.\n\nI should also consider that if the user tries to save a file with a invalid filename, like one containing invalid characters for the filesystem, the ofstream might fail to open the file.\n\nBut handling all possible filename errors would be complex, so I'll rely on ofstream's error flags to inform the user if the file can't be opened.\n\nSimilarly, if the user tries to delete a line from an empty vector, I should handle that gracefully.\n\nIn the delete_text function, I can check if text_lines is empty and display an appropriate message.\n\nif(text_lines.empty()) {\n\ncout << \"No text to delete.\" << endl;\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nThen proceed with deleting the specified line.\n\nAlso, for viewing text, if the vector is empty, I can inform the user that there's no text entered yet.\n\nIn the view_text function:\n\nif(text_lines.empty()) {\n\ncout << \"No text entered.\" << endl;\n\n} else {\n\n// Display the text\n\n}\n\nThat's good.\n\nLet me think about how to test the program.\n\nI should test various scenarios, like:\n\n- Adding single and multiple lines of text.\n\n- Deleting existing and non-existing lines.\n\n- Saving to a new file and overwriting an existing file.\n\n- Handling invalid inputs for menu choices and line numbers.\n\n- Trying to delete from an empty vector.\n\n- Trying to save an empty vector.\n\nI should also check if the file is saved correctly with the right content and formatting.\n\nMake sure that each line is written with a newline character.\n\nIn the save_file function, I'm writing each line followed by endl, which should handle the newline appropriately for the platform.\n\nAlso, I should consider that some platforms use different newline characters, but ofstream should handle that based on the system.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial display.\n\nWhen the program starts, I should welcome the user and explain what the program does.\n\nFor example:\n\ncout << \"Welcome to the Basic Text Editor!\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"You can add, delete, view, and save text.\" << endl;\n\nThen proceed to the menu loop.\n\nAlso, before exiting, I can prompt the user if they want to save changes.\n\nBut for this basic version, I'll assume that the user will remember to save their work.\n\nAdding a prompt before exiting can be a nice feature, but it complicates the program.\n\nI'll leave that for a more advanced version.\n\nLet me also consider that if the user chooses to add text multiple times, the new text is appended to the existing text.\n\nIf I want to allow inserting text at a specific position, I can add that functionality later.\n\nFor now, adding text will always append to the end.\n\nSimilarly, deleting text will only delete a single specified line.\n\nIf I want to delete multiple lines, I can consider allowing the user to specify a range, but that's more advanced.\n\nLet me think about how to handle line numbers when viewing text.\n\nI should make sure that line numbers start from 1 and are aligned properly.\n\nFor example:\n\n1: First line\n\n2: Second line\n\n3: Third line\n\nI can use cout's formatting options to align the line numbers.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll just print the line number followed by a colon and the text.\n\nNow, about the code organization.\n\nI'll include the necessary headers:\n\n- iostream for input and output\n\n- vector to store text lines\n\n- fstream to handle file operations\n\n- limits to use numeric_limits for ignoring input\n\nI'll also use the std namespace to avoid qualifying standard library names.\n\nLet me list out the headers:\n\n#include <iostream>\n\n#include <vector>\n\n#include <fstream>\n\n#include <limits>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nThen define the functions as outlined earlier.\n\nI should also consider defining a constant for the number of newlines to print in clear_screen, so it's easier to change if needed.\n\nconst int SCREEN_CLEAR_LINES = 50;\n\nvoid clear_screen() {\n\ncout << string(SCREEN_CLEAR_LINES, '\\n');\n\n}\n\nThat's flexible.\n\nNow, putting it all together, here's a rough sketch of the code:\n\n#include <iostream>\n\n#include <vector>\n\n#include <fstream>\n\n#include <limits>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function prototypes\n\nvoid add_text(vector<string>& text_lines);\n\nvoid delete_text(vector<string>& text_lines);\n\nvoid view_text(const vector<string>& text_lines);\n\nvoid save_file(const vector<string>& text_lines);\n\nint main() {\n\nvector<string> text_lines;\n\ncout << \"Welcome to the Basic Text Editor!\" << endl;\n\ncout << \"You can add, delete, view, and save text.\" << endl;\n\nint choice;\n\ndo

We will use a vector to store the text lines and handle file operations using standard C++ libraries.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Menu-Driven Interface**: Use a loop to display a menu allowing the user to choose operations: add text, delete text, view text, save file, or exit.\n2. **Text Management**:\n   - **Add text**: Read multiple lines of input from the user and store them in a vector.\n   - **Delete text**: Remove a specified line from the vector.\n   - **View text**: Display current text lines with their line numbers.\n   - **Save file**: Write the vector contents to a specified file.\n3. **Error Handling**: Ensure the program handles invalid inputs and file operation errors gracefully.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <limits>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function prototypes\nvoid add_text(vector<string>& text_lines);\nvoid delete_text(vector<string>& text_lines);\nvoid view_text(const vector<string>& text_lines);\nvoid save_file(const vector<string>& text_lines);\nvoid clear_screen();\n\nint main() {\n    vector<string> text_lines;\n    cout << \"Welcome to the Basic Text Editor!\" << endl;\n    cout << \"You can add, delete, view, and save text.\" << endl;\n    int choice;\n    do {\n        clear_screen();\n        cout << \"Menu:\" << endl;\n        cout << \"1.
