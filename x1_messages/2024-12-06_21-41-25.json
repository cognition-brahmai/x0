        "content": "So there are 200 students in total at this school. Half of them play soccer, which means 100 students play soccer because half of 200 is 100. Then, one-third of them play basketball. One-third of 200 is approximately 66.67, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, maybe it's 67 students, or perhaps it's rounded differently. Wait, actually, 200 divided by 3 is exactly 66.666..., so maybe the problem expects us to round it to 67 students.\n\nSo, if 100 play soccer and 67 play basketball, that adds up to 167 students. Then, the rest play volleyball. So, 200 minus 167 is 33 students. Therefore, 33 students play volleyball.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem wants us to consider exact fractions without rounding. So, if one-third of 200 is exactly 200/3, which is 66 and two-thirds. But since we can't have two-thirds of a student, perhaps the problem assumes that 66 students play basketball.\n\nSo, 100 soccer + 66 basketball = 166 students. Then, 200 - 166 = 34 students play volleyball.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider the exact fraction and deal with it accordingly. Let's see.\n\nTotal students = 200\n\nSoccer players = 1/2 of 200 = 100\n\nBasketball players = 1/3 of 200 = 200/3 \u2248 66.67\n\nVolleyball players = total students - (soccer players + basketball players) = 200 - (100 + 66.67) = 200 - 166.67 = 33.33\n\nAgain, we can't have a fraction of a student, so we need to decide how to handle this.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that exactly one-third play basketball, which would be 66 students, since 3 * 66 = 198, which is less than 200, and then volleyball players would be 200 - 100 - 66 = 34.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 67 basketball players, making volleyball players 200 - 100 - 67 = 33.\n\nI think the most accurate way is to consider that basketball players are exactly one-third of 200, which is 200/3 = 66.666..., and since we can't have a fraction of a student, we might need to assume that it's either 66 or 67 students.\n\nBut the problem says \"one-third of them play basketball\", so perhaps it's exact, meaning 66.666..., but since we can't have that, maybe the problem has a mistake or needs to be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"rest play volleyball\" accounts for the fraction.\n\nBut in reality, the number of students playing basketball should be a whole number, so maybe the problem expects us to round 200/3 to the nearest whole number, which is 67.\n\nSo, 100 soccer + 67 basketball = 167 students, and 200 - 167 = 33 students play volleyball.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that exactly 200/3 play basketball, and the rest play volleyball, with the understanding that the numbers might not be whole numbers.\n\nBut since we're dealing with people, it's unusual to have a fraction of a person, so probably the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that 33 students play volleyball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{34} \\]"
