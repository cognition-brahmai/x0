        "content": "Let's see. So, there are four friends who decide to split the cost of a gift equally. That means each person was supposed to pay the same amount. But one friend forgets his wallet, so only three friends end up paying. And because of that, each of the three pays an extra $5 to cover the cost.\n\nI need to find out what the original price of the gift was.\n\nLet me try to set this up with some variables. Let\u2019s say the total cost of the gift is C dollars.\n\nIf all four friends were splitting the cost equally, each would pay C/4 dollars.\n\nBut since one friend didn\u2019t pay, the other three had to cover his share. So each of the three paid an extra $5.\n\nThat means each of the three paid their original share plus an extra $5.\n\nSo, each of the three paid: (C/4) + 5 dollars.\n\nBut since only three are paying, the total amount they pay should equal the entire cost C.\n\nSo, 3 * [(C/4) + 5] = C.\n\nNow, I can solve for C.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n3*(C/4) + 3*5 = C\n\nThat\u2019s (3C)/4 + 15 = C\n\nNow, subtract (3C)/4 from both sides to get:\n\n15 = C - (3C)/4\n\n15 = (4C)/4 - (3C)/4\n\n15 = (1C)/4\n\nSo, C/4 = 15\n\nTherefore, C = 15 * 4\n\nC = 60\n\nSo, the original price of the gift was $60.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf the gift costs $60, and four friends split it, each would pay $15.\n\nBut one friend doesn\u2019t pay, so the other three have to cover his $15.\n\nSo, the extra amount each pays is $5, and there are three of them, so they cover the $15 total.\n\nEach of the three pays their original $15 plus an extra $5, totaling $20 each.\n\nAnd 3 * $20 = $60, which matches the total cost.\n\nSo, yeah, the original price was $60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
