        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about candies in a bag. There are red, blue, and green candies, and I'm given some ratios between them. The ratio of red to blue candies is 3:2, and the ratio of blue to green candies is 5:4. I need to find the ratio of red to green candies.\n\nOkay, so ratios can be a bit tricky, but if I break it down step by step, I should be able to figure this out.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, when they say the ratio of red to blue candies is 3:2, it means that for every 3 red candies, there are 2 blue candies.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of blue to green candies is 5:4, meaning for every 5 blue candies, there are 4 green candies.\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of red to green candies. But I don't have a direct ratio between red and green; I only have their relationships through blue candies.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to relate red and green candies using the blue candies as a bridge.\n\nOne way to do this is to express both ratios in terms of a common quantity, which in this case would be blue candies.\n\nLet's denote the number of red candies as R, blue candies as B, and green candies as G.\n\nFrom the first ratio, red to blue is 3:2, which can be written as:\n\nR / B = 3 / 2\n\nSimilarly, the second ratio, blue to green is 5:4, which is:\n\nB / G = 5 / 4\n\nI need to find R / G.\n\nHmm.\n\nIf I solve the first equation for R, I get:\n\nR = (3/2) * B\n\nAnd from the second equation, I can solve for G:\n\nG = (4/5) * B\n\nNow, to find R / G, I can substitute these expressions:\n\nR / G = [(3/2) * B] / [(4/5) * B]\n\nOh, I see. The B's will cancel out.\n\nSo, R / G = (3/2) / (4/5)\n\nDividing fractions: dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\nSo, (3/2) divided by (4/5) is (3/2) times (5/4).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(3/2) * (5/4) = (3*5) / (2*4) = 15 / 8\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red to green candies is 15:8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to make the common term, which is blue candies, have the same value in both ratios.\n\nSo, in the first ratio, red to blue is 3:2.\n\nIn the second ratio, blue to green is 5:4.\n\nI need to make the blue part the same in both ratios.\n\nLet's find the least common multiple (LCM) of the blue parts, which are 2 and 5.\n\nThe LCM of 2 and 5 is 10.\n\nSo, I'll adjust both ratios so that the blue candies are 10 in each.\n\nFirst ratio: red to blue is 3:2.\n\nTo make blue = 10, I need to multiply both parts by 5.\n\nSo, red = 3*5 = 15, blue = 2*5 = 10.\n\nSo, red to blue is 15:10.\n\nSecond ratio: blue to green is 5:4.\n\nTo make blue = 10, I need to multiply both parts by 2.\n\nSo, blue = 5*2 = 10, green = 4*2 = 8.\n\nSo, blue to green is 10:8.\n\nNow, since blue is the same in both ratios, I can combine them.\n\nRed : blue : green = 15 : 10 : 8\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red to green candies is 15:8.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the ratio of red to green candies is 15:8.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15:8} \\]"
