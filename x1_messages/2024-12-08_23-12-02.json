It seeks to understand the universe as a whole, from its birth in the Big Bang to its current state and future evolution. Cosmologists study a wide range of phenomena, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the distribution of galaxies, the expansion of the universe, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. They use a variety of tools and techniques, including observations from telescopes, computer simulations, and theoretical models, to explore the mysteries of the cosmos."
