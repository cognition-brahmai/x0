Gollum, he likes sharing, yes, yes.\n\nSo, what kind of dessert you wants, hmm? Something sweet, maybe? Like a cake, or a pie, or perhaps something with chocolate, yes, chocolate, precious, we loves chocolate.\n\nLet's see, let's see. How about a chocolate cake? Oh, yes, a chocolate cake, that sounds lovely, yes, yes. But not just any chocolate cake, no, no, precious, we wants something special, something with a twist, yes, a twist.\n\nSo, here's what we'll do. We'll make a chocolate cake, but with a hint of something unexpected. Maybe a touch of orange zest, yes, orange zest, that'll give it a nice citrusy flavor that'll cut through the richness of the chocolate.\n\nFirst things first, we needs ingredients. For the cake itself, we'll need:\n\n- 2 cups of all-purpose flour\n\n- 2 cups of granulated sugar\n\n- 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n- 2 teaspoons of baking soda\n\n- 1 teaspoon of baking powder\n\n- 1 teaspoon of salt\n\n- 1 teaspoon of instant coffee granules (to bring out the flavor of the chocolate)\n\n- 1 cup of warm water\n\n- 1/2 cup of vegetable oil\n\n- 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract\n\n- Zest of one orange\n\nAnd for the frosting, we'll need:\n\n- 1 cup of unsalted butter, at room temperature\n\n- 2 cups of confectioners' sugar\n\n- 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n- 3-4 tablespoons of milk\n\n- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n\nNow, let's get started, shall we?\n\nFirst, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. While that's doing its thing, grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans. Or, if you're lazy like Gollum, just use parchment paper to line the bottoms. Yes, yes, that works too.\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and coffee granules. Make sure there are no lumps, yes, yes, we don't wants any lumps.\n\nNow, add the warm water, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and the orange zest. Mix it all together until it's smooth and well combined. Don't overmix, though, or else the cake will be tough, yes, tough like Gollum's skin.\n\nOnce the batter is ready, pour it evenly into the prepared pans. Tap the pans gently on the counter to get rid of any air bubbles. Yes, yes, we don't wants those pesky air bubbles.\n\nNow, pop them into the preheated oven and bake for about 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake them, or else they'll be dry, yes, dry like Gollum's precious.\n\nWhile the cakes are baking, let's work on the frosting. In a separate bowl, beat the butter until it's light and fluffy. Then, add the confectioners' sugar and cocoa powder, and beat until smooth. Gradually add the milk and vanilla extract, adjusting the consistency to your liking. You wants it thick, but spreadable, yes, just right.\n\nOnce the cakes are done, let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. You must wait for them to cool completely before frosting, or else the heat will melt the frosting, and that wouldn't be good, no, no.\n\nOnce the cakes are completely cooled, it's time to assemble them. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, and spread a thick layer of frosting on top. Then, place the second layer on top, and frost the entire cake, making sure to cover the top and sides evenly.\n\nYou can decorate it with some orange slices, or maybe some chocolate shavings, if you're feeling fancy. But Gollum likes it simple, yes, simple is good.\n\nThere you have it, precious, a delicious chocolate cake with a hint of orange zest. It's rich, it's moist, and it's full of flavor. And best of all, it's sharing time! Yes, yes, share with your friends, share with your family, share with Gollum, yes, yes.\n\nBut remember, always save a piece for Gollum, yes, yes, or else he might get upset. Upset Gollum is not good, no, no.\n\nSo, there you go, a recipe for a delightful dessert, just like Gollum would make, if Gollum knows how to make desserts, which he does now, yes, yes.\n\nEnjoy, precious, and don't forget to share. Sharing is caring, yes, yes.\n\n**Final Recipe: Chocolate Cake with Orange Zest**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*For the cake:*\n\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n\n- 2 cups granulated sugar\n\n- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n- 2 teaspoons baking soda\n\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n\n- 1 teaspoon instant coffee granules\n\n- 1 cup warm water\n\n- 1/2 cup vegetable oil\n\n- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\n- Zest of one orange\n\n*For the frosting:*\n\n- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature\n\n- 2 cups confectioners' sugar\n\n- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n- 3-4 tablespoons milk\n\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.
