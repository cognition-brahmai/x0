This phenomenon occurs when the desire for group consensus overrides people's common sense desire to present alternatives, critique a position, or express an unpopular opinion. The desire for group cohesion effectively drives out good decision-making and problem solving. It is often observed in highly cohesive groups where the pressure for conformity is strong.\nWhich of the following is a likely consequence of groupthink?\nA. Increased creativity due to diverse viewpoints.\nB. Poor decision-making due to lack of critical evaluation.\nC. Increased individuality due to resistance to conformity.\nD.

        "content": "Let's dive into this question about groupthink. So, groupthink is this concept in social psychology where people in a group prioritize harmony and consensus over critical thinking and rational decision-making. It's like when everyone just goes along with the flow to avoid conflict, even if they have doubts or better ideas.\n\nThe question is asking about the likely consequences of groupthink, and there are four options:\n\nA. Increased creativity due to diverse viewpoints.\n\nB. Poor decision-making due to lack of critical evaluation.\n\nC. Increased individuality due to resistance to conformity.\n\nD. Improved problem-solving due to collective intelligence.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what groupthink is all about. From what I remember, groupthink happens when a group is so focused on maintaining unity that they don't consider all possible alternatives or critique ideas thoroughly. This can lead to some pretty bad decisions because they might overlook important information or not think through the consequences properly.\n\nOption A says increased creativity due to diverse viewpoints. But wait, groupthink is actually the opposite of that. It suppresses diverse viewpoints because people are afraid to speak up or go against the group's opinion. So, I don't think creativity increases in groupthink situations; instead, it might decrease because people aren't sharing their unique ideas.\n\nOption B is poor decision-making due to lack of critical evaluation. This sounds spot on. One of the main issues with groupthink is that decisions are made without thoroughly evaluating all options and considering potential risks. People just go along with the majority opinion to maintain group harmony, which can lead to suboptimal or even disastrous decisions.\n\nOption C suggests increased individuality due to resistance to conformity. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Groupthink is all about conformity and avoiding dissent. So, if anything, individuality is suppressed in groupthink scenarios, not increased. People are more likely to conform to the group's thinking rather than asserting their individual opinions.\n\nOption D talks about improved problem-solving due to collective intelligence. While collective intelligence can be beneficial, in groupthink situations, the collective intelligence isn't being used effectively because not everyone is contributing their thoughts openly. So, the group might think they're being smart, but in reality, they're missing out on valuable input from some members.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like option B is the most accurate consequence of groupthink: poor decision-making due to lack of critical evaluation.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think about real-life examples. One famous case is the Bay of Pigs invasion during the Kennedy administration. The decision to invade was influenced by groupthink, where the group of advisors didn't critically evaluate the plan and instead went along with the consensus. The result was a failed invasion and a embarrassment for the U.S.\n\nAnother example is the Challenger space shuttle disaster. Managers at NASA overlooked warnings about the O-ring seals because of groupthink pressures, leading to the tragic explosion.\n\nThese examples reinforce that groupthink leads to poor decision-making because the group fails to critically evaluate all aspects of the situation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
