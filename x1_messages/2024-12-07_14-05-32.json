        "content": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. It's an NP-hard problem, meaning that as the number of cities increases, the time required to find an exact solution grows exponentially.\n\n### Approach\n\nWe will use dynamic programming to solve the TSP. The idea is to maintain a state that represents the current city and the set of cities that have already been visited. For each state, we compute the shortest path that reaches the current city from the starting city, visiting the set of cities exactly once.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef tsp_dp(distances):\n    n = len(distances)\n    all_sets_minus_start = (1 << n) - 1  # All cities except the starting city\n    dp = {}  # Dictionary to store the dp states\n\n    # Generate all possible subsets\n    for subset in range(1 << n):\n        for current_city in range(n):\n            if not (subset & (1 << current_city)):\n                continue\n            # Base case: starting city with no cities visited\n            if subset == 1 << current_city:\n                dp[(subset, current_city)] = distances[0][current_city]\n            else:\n                min_distance = sys.maxsize\n                for last_city in range(n):\n                    if last_city != current_city and (subset & (1 << last_city)):\n                        new_distance = dp[(subset ^ (1 << current_city), last_city)] + distances[last_city][current_city]\n                        if new_distance < min_distance:\n                            min_distance = new_distance\n                dp[(subset, current_city)] = min_distance\n\n    # Find the minimum distance to return to start\n    min_distance = sys.maxsize\n    for city in range(1, n):\n        distance = dp[(all_sets_minus_start, city)] + distances[city][0]\n        if distance < min_distance:\n            min_distance = distance\n\n    return min_distance\n\n# Example usage\ndistances = [\n    [0, 10, 15, 20],\n    [10, 0, 35, 25],\n    [15, 35, 0, 30],\n    [20, 25, 30, 0]\n]\nprint(tsp_dp(distances))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We have a distance matrix `distances` where `distances[i][j]` represents the distance from city `i` to city `j`.\n   - We use a dictionary `dp` to store the minimum cost for each state, where the state is represented by a pair `(subset, current_city)`. Here, `subset` is a bitmask indicating which cities have been visited, and `current_city` is the current city.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:\n   - For each subset of cities and for each current city in that subset:\n     - If the subset consists of only the starting city and the current city, the cost is directly from the starting city to the current city.\n     - Otherwise, we iterate over all possible last cities visited before coming to the current city and take the minimum of these possibilities.\n\n3. **Final Solution**:\n   - After computing all states, we consider all possible cities to be the last city visited before returning to the starting city and take the minimum of these total distances.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- The time complexity is \\( O(n^2 2^n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of cities.\n- This is because there are \\( O(n \\times 2^n) \\) states, and for each state, we perform up to \\( O(n) \\) operations to compute the minimum distance.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the shortest path by reusing previously computed results, significantly reducing the computation time compared to a brute-force approach.\n"
