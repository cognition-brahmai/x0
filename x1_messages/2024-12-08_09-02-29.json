To find the number of edges in such a graph, we can use the formula for combinations, since each edge is a unique pair of vertices.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of n is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of edges} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor a complete graph with 10 vertices (K\u2081\u2080):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of edges} = \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nTherefore, a complete graph with 10 vertices has 45 edges."
