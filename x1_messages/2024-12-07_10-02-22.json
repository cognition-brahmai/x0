        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A group of people are working on a project that requires 120 hours to complete. They can only work 4 hours per day and have 10 days to finish it. I need to figure out how many people need to be in the group to get this done on time.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. The total work required is 120 hours. They have 10 days to work on it, and each day they can work 4 hours. So, each person can contribute 4 hours per day for 10 days. That means each person can contribute a total of 4 hours/day * 10 days = 40 hours per person.\n\nNow, the total work is 120 hours, and each person can contribute 40 hours. So, the number of people needed would be the total work divided by the work each person can do. That is, 120 hours / 40 hours per person = 3 people.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Let's see another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total work hours available per day. If there are P people, and each works 4 hours per day, then the total work per day is 4P hours. They have 10 days to complete 120 hours of work. So, the total work done would be 4P hours/day * 10 days = 40P hours.\n\nThis needs to equal the total work required, which is 120 hours. So, 40P = 120. Solving for P, I get P = 120 / 40 = 3 people.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer. It seems that 3 people are needed to complete the project in 10 days, working 4 hours each day.\n\nBut let me make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Is there anything else mentioned in the problem that I might have missed? It doesn't look like it. The problem is pretty straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any constraints or additional information that might affect the number of people needed. For example, are there any dependencies in the project that might require more or fewer people? The problem doesn't specify anything like that, so I'll assume that the work can be evenly distributed among the people.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any partial people \u2013 like, can you have a fraction of a person? But since you can't have a fraction of a person in reality, and the calculation gave me a whole number, that's fine.\n\nSo, my final answer is that 3 people are needed in the group to complete the project in the given time frame.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
