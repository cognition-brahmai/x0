        "content": "So the movie theater has 20 rows, and each row has 15 seats. If the theater sells out for a show, that means every seat is filled. I need to find out how many people attended the show in that case.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of seats in the theater. Since there are 20 rows and each row has 15 seats, I can multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row to get the total number of seats.\n\nSo, total seats = number of rows \u00d7 number of seats per row\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal seats = 20 \u00d7 15\n\nNow, 20 multiplied by 15. I know that 20 times 10 is 200, and 20 times 5 is 100, so 20 times 15 would be 200 plus 100, which is 300.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 15 as 10 + 5, so:\n\n20 \u00d7 15 = 20 \u00d7 (10 + 5) = (20 \u00d7 10) + (20 \u00d7 5) = 200 + 100 = 300\n\nOr, I could do it like this:\n\n   20\n\n\u00d7 15\n\n------\n\n 100   (20 \u00d7 5)\n\n+200   (20 \u00d7 10)\n\n------\n\n 300\n\nSo, the total number of seats in the theater is 300.\n\nNow, if the theater sells out for a show, that means all seats are occupied, so the number of people attending the show would be equal to the total number of seats.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who attended the show is 300.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the number of attendees. For example, sometimes theaters might have reserved seats or VIP areas, but in this problem, it's just 20 rows with 15 seats each, and it's sold out.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no seats that are not available for sale, like broken seats or seats reserved for staff, but again, the problem says it's sold out, so I think 300 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the seating arrangement. If it's 20 rows with 15 seats each, it's probably a rectangular arrangement. The total seating capacity would be the product of the number of rows and the number of seats per row, which is 20 \u00d7 15 = 300.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if the theater sells out for a show, 300 people attended the show.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
