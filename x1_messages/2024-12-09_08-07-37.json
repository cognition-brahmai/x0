We need to find out how many days it will take to produce 30,000 units of A and 50,000 units of B.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many days are needed for each product separately and then see which one takes longer, because the factory produces both products simultaneously.\n\nSo, for product A:\n\nTotal units needed: 30,000\n\nDaily production: 1500\n\nDays needed for A = 30,000 / 1500 = 20 days\n\nFor product B:\n\nTotal units needed: 50,000\n\nDaily production: 2500\n\nDays needed for B = 50,000 / 2500 = 20 days\n\nHmm, both products take 20 days to produce the required amounts. So, it seems like it will take 20 days in total.\n\nBut wait, maybe the factory can produce both products at the same time. Does that change anything?\n\nWell, since the productions are happening simultaneously, the factory is producing 1500 A and 2500 B each day. We need 30,000 A and 50,000 B.\n\nSo, after 20 days, we'd have:\n\nA: 1500 * 20 = 30,000\n\nB: 2500 * 20 = 50,000\n\nPerfect, that matches what I need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to combine the productions or something, but I think 20 days is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
