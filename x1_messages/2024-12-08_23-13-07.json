        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 1200 students in total. Out of these, 60% participate in sports activities. That means we first need to find out how many students actually participate in sports.\n\nTo find 60% of 1200, I can multiply 1200 by 0.60 (since 60% equals 0.60 in decimal form). Let me do that:\n\n1200 \u00d7 0.60 = 720\n\nSo, 720 students participate in sports activities.\n\nNow, among these sports participants, 40% play basketball. So, I need to find out what 40% of 720 is. Again, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal, so 40% becomes 0.40. Then, I'll multiply 720 by 0.40:\n\n720 \u00d7 0.40 = 288\n\nTherefore, 288 students play basketball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the total number of students, which is 1200, and 60% participate in sports:\n\n1200 \u00d7 0.60 = 720\n\nThat seems correct. Then, 40% of these 720 students play basketball:\n\n720 \u00d7 0.40 = 288\n\nYes, that looks right. So, the final answer is 288 students play basketball.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can approach the problem differently to confirm. Let's see, another way to look at it is to find 40% of 60% of the total students, which should give me the same result.\n\nFirst, 60% of 1200 is 720, as before. Then, 40% of 720 is 288. Alternatively, I could calculate it in one step:\n\n1200 \u00d7 0.60 \u00d7 0.40 = ?\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n1200 \u00d7 0.60 = 720\n\n720 \u00d7 0.40 = 288\n\nSame result. Alternatively, I could multiply 1200 by 0.60 times 0.40 directly:\n\n1200 \u00d7 (0.60 \u00d7 0.40) = 1200 \u00d7 0.24 = 288\n\nAgain, 288 students.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find 24% of 1200, since 60% of 40% is 24% (because 0.60 \u00d7 0.40 = 0.24). So, 24% of 1200 should be:\n\n1200 \u00d7 0.24 = 288\n\nOnce more, confirming the answer is 288 students.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The problem is straightforward once you break it down into steps. Sometimes percentages can be tricky, but by converting them to decimals and multiplying step by step, it's easy to get the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
