        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving Station A going towards Station B at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaving Station B going towards Station A at 80 miles per hour. The distance between the two stations is 280 miles. I need to find out when they meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds add up. That means the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is 60 mph plus 80 mph, which is 140 mph.\n\nNow, if they are covering a distance of 280 miles together at a combined speed of 140 mph, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their combined speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 280 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n280 divided by 140 is 2. So, the time is 2 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nMaybe I should verify this by thinking about it differently. Let's consider how far each train travels in that time.\n\nIf the first train is going at 60 mph, in 2 hours it would cover:\n\n60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nThe second train is going at 80 mph, so in 2 hours it would cover:\n\n80 mph * 2 hours = 160 miles.\n\nNow, if I add the distances they've each traveled: 120 miles + 160 miles = 280 miles, which is exactly the distance between the two stations.\n\nSo, yes, they would meet after 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which again is 140 mph. So, the time it takes for them to cover the 280 miles at that relative speed is still 2 hours.\n\nI think this is correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nPerhaps using the concept of closing the gap. Initially, the gap between the two trains is 280 miles. Each hour, the gap closes by the sum of their speeds, which is 140 miles per hour. So, to close a 280-mile gap at 140 miles per hour, it would take 2 hours.\n\nAnother way is to use the formula for relative motion: the time to meet is the distance divided by the relative speed. Again, that's 280 miles divided by 140 mph, which is 2 hours.\n\nI keep getting the same answer, which reinforces my confidence in it.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that might affect the meeting time, like stops or acceleration, but the problem doesn't mention any such things. It seems the trains are moving at constant speeds.\n\nAlso, the problem states that both trains leave at the same time, so no need to account for any time difference in their departures.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the trains will meet after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
