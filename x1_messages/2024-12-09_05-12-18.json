        "content": "The Battle of Waterloo was fought in present-day Belgium. It occurred on June 18, 1815, near Waterloo, which is located about 15 kilometers south of Brussels. The battle was a decisive engagement between Napoleon's French army and the combined forces of the Seventh Coalition, primarily consisting of Anglo-allied and Prussian troops. Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo led to his exile on the remote South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821."
