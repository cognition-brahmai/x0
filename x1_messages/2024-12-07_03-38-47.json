        "content": "So the company has 120 employees in total, and 70% of them are full-time workers. I need to find out how many part-time workers there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many full-time workers there are. Since 70% of the employees are full-time, I can calculate that by taking 70% of 120.\n\nTo calculate 70% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.70.\n\n120 * 0.70 = 84\n\nSo, there are 84 full-time workers.\n\nNow, to find the number of part-time workers, I need to subtract the number of full-time workers from the total number of employees.\n\nTotal employees - full-time workers = part-time workers\n\n120 - 84 = 36\n\nTherefore, there are 36 part-time workers in the company.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of part-time workers directly.\n\nIf 70% are full-time, then the remaining percentage must be part-time. So, 100% - 70% = 30% are part-time workers.\n\nNow, to find 30% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.30.\n\n120 * 0.30 = 36\n\nAgain, I get 36 part-time workers.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It looks like there are 36 part-time workers in the company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
