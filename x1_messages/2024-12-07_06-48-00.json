Behavioral psychology, also known as behaviorism, focuses on how our environment influences our actions, particularly through the use of reinforcement and punishment. Rewards are a form of positive reinforcement, which is a key concept in behavioral psychology. This approach suggests that behaviors followed by rewards are more likely to be repeated in the future.\n\nIn the context of a child's learning process, behavioral psychology would explore how rewards can shape and reinforce desired behaviors or learning outcomes. For example, praising a child for completing their homework on time or giving them stickers for good behavior are examples of rewards that can encourage continued positive actions.\n\nWhile other sub-disciplines may also touch upon aspects of learning and behavior, behavioral psychology is most directly concerned with the relationship between environmental stimuli and observable behaviors, making it the most appropriate choice for studying the impact of rewards on learning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
