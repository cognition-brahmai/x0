        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a bag with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 5 green balls. That's a total of 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 balls. We're picking two balls without replacement, and we want to find the probability that both balls are the same color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to pick two balls without replacement. It means that once I pick the first ball, it doesn't go back into the bag, so the total number of balls decreases by one for the second pick.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible ways to pick two balls out of 12.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to pick two balls out of 12, I can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 12 is C(12, 2). Let's calculate that:\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, there are 66 possible ways to pick two balls from the bag.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the ways to pick two balls of the same color.\n\nThere are three colors: red, blue, and green. So, we'll calculate the number of ways to pick two red balls, two blue balls, and two green balls, and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to pick two red balls. There are 4 red balls, so C(4, 2):\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2!)) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to pick two red balls.\n\nNext, the number of ways to pick two blue balls. There are 3 blue balls, so C(3, 2):\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3 - 2)!) = (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1) = 3.\n\nSo, there are 3 ways to pick two blue balls.\n\nFinally, the number of ways to pick two green balls. There are 5 green balls, so C(5, 2):\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to pick two green balls.\n\nNow, add up all the favorable outcomes: 6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 10 (green) = 19.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are the same color is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 19/66.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem, just to verify.\n\nAnother way to calculate probability is to consider the probabilities of each sequence of events and then add them up.\n\nSo, for example, the probability of picking two red balls can be calculated as the probability of picking a red ball first and then another red ball second, without replacement.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is 4/12, since there are 4 red balls out of 12 total balls.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 3 red balls left and a total of 11 balls left in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 3/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking two red balls in a row is (4/12) \u00d7 (3/11) = (1/3) \u00d7 (3/11) = 1/11.\n\nSimilarly, for blue balls:\n\nProbability of picking a blue ball first: 3/12 = 1/4.\n\nThen, probability of picking another blue ball: 2/11.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two blue balls is (1/4) \u00d7 (2/11) = 2/44 = 1/22.\n\nFor green balls:\n\nProbability of picking a green ball first: 5/12.\n\nThen, probability of picking another green ball: 4/11.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two green balls is (5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) = 20/132 = 5/33.\n\nNow, to find the total probability of picking two balls of the same color, we add up these probabilities:\n\nProbability same color = Probability both red + Probability both blue + Probability both green = 1/11 + 1/22 + 5/33.\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. Let's see, 11, 22, and 33 are all multiples of 11.\n\n22 is 2 \u00d7 11, and 33 is 3 \u00d7 11. So, the least common multiple is 66.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n1/11 = 6/66\n\n1/22 = 3/66\n\n5/33 = 10/66\n\nAdd them up: 6/66 + 3/66 + 10/66 = 19/66.\n\nSo, we get the same result as before, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are the same color is 19/66.\n\nWait, but I should check if this can be simplified. 19 and 66 don't have any common factors besides 1, so it's already in simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the general formula for the probability of drawing two items of the same type without replacement.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nP(same) = \u03a3 [ (n_i / N) * ( (n_i - 1) / (N - 1) ) ]\n\nWhere n_i is the number of items of type i, and N is the total number of items.\n\nIn this case, N = 12, and we have three types: red (n=4), blue (n=3), green (n=5).\n\nSo, P(same) = [ (4/12)*(3/11) ] + [ (3/12)*(2/11) ] + [ (5/12)*(4/11) ].\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(4/12)*(3/11) = (1/3)*(3/11) = 1/11\n\n(3/12)*(2/11) = (1/4)*(2/11) = 1/22\n\n(5/12)*(4/11) = (5/12)*(4/11) = 20/132 = 5/33\n\nNow, add them up: 1/11 + 1/22 + 5/33.\n\nAs before, convert to a common denominator of 66:\n\n1/11 = 6/66\n\n1/22 = 3/66\n\n5/33 = 10/66\n\nTotal: 6/66 + 3/66 + 10/66 = 19/66.\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that 19/66 is the correct probability.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of ways to pick two balls of the same color and divide by the total number of ways to pick any two balls.\n\nWe already did that earlier and got 19/66.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the probability of picking two balls of different colors and subtract that from 1 to get the probability of picking two balls of the same color.\n\nLet's try that as another check.\n\nFirst, find the probability that the two balls are different colors.\n\nThere are three possible pairs of different colors: red and blue, red and green, blue and green.\n\nWe can calculate the probability for each pair and then add them up.\n\nProbability of first ball red and second ball blue:\n\n(4/12)*(3/11) = 1/3 * 3/11 = 1/11\n\nProbability of first ball red and second ball green:\n\n(4/12)*(5/11) = 1/3 * 5/11 = 5/33\n\nProbability of first ball blue and second ball red:\n\n(3/12)*(4/11) = 1/4 * 4/11 = 1/11\n\nProbability of first ball blue and second ball green:\n\n(3/12)*(5/11) = 1/4 * 5/11 = 5/44\n\nProbability of first ball green and second ball red:\n\n(5/12)*(4/11) = 5/12 * 4/11 = 20/132 = 5/33\n\nProbability of first ball green and second ball blue:\n\n(5/12)*(3/11) = 5/12 * 3/11 = 15/132 = 5/44\n\nNow, add up all these probabilities:\n\n1/11 + 5/33 + 1/11 + 5/44 + 5/33 + 5/44.\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. The denominators are 11, 33, and 44. The least common multiple of 11, 33, and 44 is 132.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n1/11 = 12/132\n\n5/33 = 20/132\n\n1/11 = 12/132\n\n5/44 = 15/132\n\n5/33 = 20/132\n\n5/44 = 15/132\n\nNow, add them up: 12 + 20 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 15 = 94.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two balls of different colors is 94/132.\n\nSimplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 2, get 47/66.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking two balls of the same color is 1 minus the probability of picking two balls of different colors:\n\n1 - 47/66 = (66/66) - (47/66) = 19/66.\n\nAgain, the same result. This reinforces that 19/66 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the problem in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the second ball matches the color of the first ball.\n\nSo, P(second ball matches first) = P(second ball is the same color as the first)\n\nThis can be calculated by considering the color of the first ball and then the probability that the second ball matches that color.\n\nSince the first ball can be any color, we can use the law of total probability.\n\nP(second matches first) = P(second is red | first is red) * P(first is red) + P(second is blue | first is blue) * P(first is blue) + P(second is green | first is green) * P(first is green)\n\nWe already have:\n\nP(first is red) = 4/12 = 1/3\n\nP(second is red | first is red) = 3/11\n\nSo, P(second is red | first is red) * P(first is red) = (3/11)*(1/3) = 1/11\n\nSimilarly:\n\nP(first is blue) = 3/12 = 1/4\n\nP(second is blue | first is blue) = 2/11\n\nSo, P(second is blue | first is blue) * P(first is blue) = (2/11)*(1/4) = 1/22\n\nAnd:\n\nP(first is green) = 5/12\n\nP(second is green | first is green) = 4/11\n\nSo, P(second is green | first is green) * P(first is green) = (4/11)*(5/12) = 20/132 = 5/33\n\nNow, add them up: 1/11 + 1/22 + 5/33\n\nAs before, convert to a common denominator of 66:\n\n1/11 = 6/66\n\n1/22 = 3/66\n\n5/33 = 10/66\n\nTotal: 6/66 + 3/66 + 10/66 = 19/66\n\nOnce again, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that the probability is 19/66.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nWe can think about the problem in terms of permutations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick two balls in order is 12 \u00d7 11 = 132.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two red balls in order is 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two blue balls in order is 3 \u00d7 2 = 6.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two green balls in order is 5 \u00d7 4 = 20.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is 12 + 6 + 20 = 38.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 38/132.\n\nSimplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 19/66.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis reinforces confidence in the result.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider combinations, as I did earlier, we get the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that no matter which approach we take, the probability comes out to be 19/66.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 19/66.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{66}} \\]"
