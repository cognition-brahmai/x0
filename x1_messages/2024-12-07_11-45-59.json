        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Ruby script that converts an input string into Morse code. I'm not super familiar with Morse code, but I know it's a way of encoding text into a series of dots and dashes. Each letter and number has its own unique code, and there are also codes for some punctuation marks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Morse code looks like and what characters it supports. I think it includes all the letters of the English alphabet, numbers from 0 to 9, and some common punctuation signs like period, comma, question mark, etc. Each character is represented by a combination of dots and dashes, and there are spaces between the codes for different characters.\n\nI should probably start by finding a list of Morse code mappings for each character. I can look that up online to get an accurate list. Once I have that, I can create a dictionary or a hash in Ruby that maps each character to its corresponding Morse code.\n\nNext, I need to think about how to handle the input string. The user will provide a string, and I need to convert each character in that string to its Morse code equivalent using the hash I've created. I should also consider case sensitivity. For example, should the script treat uppercase and lowercase letters differently? In Morse code, letters are typically case-insensitive, meaning that 'A' and 'a' both correspond to the same code. So, I might want to convert the entire input string to uppercase or lowercase to standardize it.\n\nAlso, I need to decide how to handle characters that are not in the Morse code mapping. For example, if the input string contains special characters or symbols that don't have a Morse code representation, I should decide whether to ignore them or to replace them with some sort of indicator, like a question mark in Morse code.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the spacing between the Morse code characters. In Morse code, there is a space between each letter, and a larger space between words. So, in the output, I need to ensure that there are spaces separating the codes for different letters, and perhaps a larger gap, like using a slash or something, to separate words.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps I need to follow:\n\n1. Create a hash that maps each character to its Morse code.\n\n2. Prompt the user to enter a string.\n\n3. Convert the input string to uppercase (or lowercase) to handle case insensitivity.\n\n4. Iterate through each character in the string:\n\na. If the character is in the hash, append its Morse code to the result string, followed by a space.\n\nb. If the character is a space (indicating a word break), append a larger space or a slash to the result string.\n\nc. If the character is not in the hash, perhaps append a question mark's Morse code or ignore it.\n\n5. Output the final Morse code string.\n\nI should also think about edge cases, like if the input string is empty, or if it contains only non-alphabetic characters. I need to make sure the script handles these situations gracefully.\n\nLet me start by finding a list of Morse code mappings. I'll look that up now.\n\n[Looks up Morse code mappings online]\n\nOkay, I found a standard Morse code chart. Here's what I've got:\n\n- A: .-\n\n- B: -...\n\n- C: -.-.\n\n- D: -..\n\n- E: .\n\n- F: ..-.\n\n- G: --.\n\n- H: ....\n\n- I: ..\n\n- J: .---\n\n- K: -.-\n\n- L: .-..\n\n- M: --\n\n- N: -.\n\n- O: ---\n\n- P: .--.\n\n- Q: --.-\n\n- R: .,.\n\n- S: ...\n\n- T: -\n\n- U: ..-\n\n- V: ...-\n\n- W: .--\n\n- X: -..-\n\n- Y: -.--\n\n- Z: --..\n\nAnd for numbers:\n\n- 0: -----\n\n- 1: .----\n\n- 2: ..---\n\n- 3: ...--\n\n- 4: ....-\n\n- 5: .....\n\n- 6: -....\n\n- 7: --...\n\n- 8: ---..\n\n- 9: ----.\n\nAnd some punctuation:\n\n- Period: .-.-.-\n\n- Comma: --..--\n\n- Question mark: ..--..\n\n- Slash: -..-.\n\n- Dash: -....-\n\n- Parenthesis: -.--.\n\n- Quote: .-...\n\n- Colon: ---...\n\n- Semicolon: -.-.-.\n\n- Equal sign: -...-\n\n- Plus sign: .-.-.\n\n- Minus sign: -....-\n\n- Multiplication sign: .-..\n\n- Division sign: -..-.\n\n- Exclamation point: -.---.\n\n- Ampersand: .-...\n\n- At sign: .--.-.\n\n- Underscore: ..--..\n\n- Space (between words): / or larger space\n\nI might not need all of these, but it's good to have a reference. Now, I'll create a hash in Ruby to map each character to its Morse code.\n\nIn Ruby, hashes are defined using curly braces, with keys and values separated by arrows. For example:\n\ncode_mapping = {\n\n 'A' => '.-', 'B' => '-...', 'C' => '-.-.',\n\n # and so on for all letters, numbers, and punctuation\n\n}\n\nI need to make sure that the keys are strings or symbols, and the values are the corresponding Morse code strings.\n\nOnce I have this hash, I can proceed to write the script.\n\nLet me start by writing a draft of the script, and I'll refine it as I go along.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Ruby script that converts an input string into Morse code, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Morse Code Mapping:** Create a hash that maps each character (letters, numbers, and punctuation) to its corresponding Morse code.\n\n2. **Handle User Input:** Read the input string from the user and standardize it to uppercase to handle case insensitivity.\n\n3. **Convert to Morse Code:** Iterate through each character in the input string:\n   - If the character is a letter, number, or supported punctuation, append its Morse code to the result.\n   - If the character is a space, indicate a larger space between words (e.g., using a slash `/`).\n   - Optionally, handle or ignore characters not in the Morse code mapping.\n\n4. **Output the Result:** Print the Morse code representation of the input string.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```ruby\n# Define the Morse code mapping\nMORSE_CODE = {\n  'A' => '.-', 'B' => '-...', 'C' => '-.-.', 'D' => '-..', 'E' => '.', 'F' => '..-.', 'G' => '--.', 'H' => '....',\n  'I' => '..', 'J' => '.---', 'K' => '-.-', 'L' => '.-..', 'M' => '--', 'N' => '-.', 'O' => '---', 'P' => '.--.',\n  'Q' => '--.-', 'R' => '.-.', 'S' => '...', 'T' => '-', 'U' => '..-', 'V' => '...-', 'W' => '.--', 'X' => '-..-',\n  'Y' => '-.--', 'Z' => '--..', '0' => '-----', '1' => '.----', '2' => '..---', '3' => '...--', '4' => '....-',\n  '5' => '.....', '6' => '-....', '7' => '--...', '8' => '---..', '9' => '----.', '.' => '.-.-.-', ',' => '--..--',\n  '?' => '..--..', '/' => '-..-.', '-' => '-....-', '(' => '-.--.', ')' => '-.--.-', '\"' => '.-..-.', ':' => '---...',\n  ';' => '-.-.-.', '=' => '-...-', '+' => '.-.-.', '-' => '-....-', '*' => '.-..', '/' => '-..-.', '!' => '-.-.--',\n  '&' => '.-...', '@' => '.--.-.', '_' => '..--..'\n}\n\ndef string_to_morse(input)\n  # Convert the input to uppercase to handle case insensitivity\n  input.upcase!\n\n  morse_code = []\n  words = input.split(' ')\n\n  words.each do |word|\n    morse_word = word.chars.map do |char|\n      MORSE_CODE[char] || '?'\n    end.join(' ')\n    morse_code << morse_word\n  end\n\n  # Join all Morse code words with a slash to separate words\n  morse_code.join(' / ')\nend\n\n# Get user input\nprint \"Enter a string to convert to Morse code: \"\ninput = gets.chomp\n\n# Convert and print the Morse code\nputs string_to_morse(input)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Morse Code Mapping:** A hash `MORSE_CODE` is defined to map each character to its Morse code.\n2. **User Input Handling:** The script reads input from the user, converts it to uppercase, and splits it into words.\n3. **Conversion Logic:** Each character in the input is converted to its corresponding Morse code. Spaces between words are represented by a slash `/`.\n4. **Output:** The Morse code for the entire input string is printed.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to convert text to Morse code, handling letters, numbers, and some punctuation."
