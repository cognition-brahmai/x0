        "content": "Let's see. There are 8 people in the room initially. Half of them have blue eyes, and the other half have green eyes. So, that means 4 people have blue eyes and 4 have green eyes.\n\nNow, one person with blue eyes leaves the room. So, the number of blue-eyed people decreases by one. That means there are now 3 blue-eyed people.\n\nThen, a person with brown eyes enters the room. So, the total number of people in the room goes back to 8, but now there are 3 blue-eyed people, 4 green-eyed people, and 1 brown-eyed person.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of blue-eyed to green-eyed people now. So, we need to find the ratio of blue-eyed people to green-eyed people.\n\nCurrently, there are 3 blue-eyed people and 4 green-eyed people. Therefore, the ratio is 3:4.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? The person who left had blue eyes, and the person who entered had brown eyes. So, the number of green-eyed people remains unchanged at 4.\n\nYes, so the ratio of blue to green is 3 to 4.\n\nI think that's the answer. But let me double-check.\n\nInitially:\n\n- Blue-eyed: 4\n\n- Green-eyed: 4\n\nAfter one blue-eyed person leaves:\n\n- Blue-eyed: 3\n\n- Green-eyed: 4\n\nThen, one brown-eyed person enters:\n\n- Blue-eyed: 3\n\n- Green-eyed: 4\n\n- Brown-eyed: 1\n\nBut the ratio requested is only between blue and green-eyed people, so the brown-eyed person doesn't affect that ratio.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is indeed 3:4.\n\nAlternatively, it can be expressed as 3/4 or 0.75, but since it's a ratio, 3:4 is fine.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total number of people again to ensure accuracy.\n\nInitially, 8 people: 4 blue, 4 green.\n\nAfter one blue leaves, 7 people: 3 blue, 4 green.\n\nThen, one brown enters, making it 8 people again: 3 blue, 4 green, 1 brown.\n\nSo, blue to green is still 3:4.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think there's more to it. It's a straightforward problem in ratios and basic arithmetic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}} \\]"
