But I think the best way to handle stress is to just take it one step at a time, like when I'm trying to kick that football. I have to focus and not let the pressure get to me.\n\nMaybe talking to someone helps too, like talking to Snoopy or Linus. They might not always understand, but it feels good to share my worries. And sometimes, doing something I enjoy, like playing baseball or flying kites, can take my mind off things.\n\nAlso, remembering that it's okay to make mistakes. I mean, I've fallen flat on my face more times than I can count, but each time, I get back up and try again. Stress is just another obstacle, and overcoming it makes me stronger.\n\nSo, in short, take deep breaths, talk to friends, do things you enjoy, and remember that it's okay to not be perfect. That's what I tell myself, anyway."
