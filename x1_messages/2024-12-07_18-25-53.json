        "content": "The Pythagorean theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who is traditionally credited with its discovery and proof. However, it's essential to note that the theorem was known and used by various ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians and Indians, centuries before Pythagoras. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship is expressed as a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c represents the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides."
