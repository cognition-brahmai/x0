        "content": "So I have this matrix:\n\n| 2  1 |\n\n| 1  2 |\n\nAnd I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I remember that eigenvalues are scalars that satisfy the equation (A - \u03bbI)v = 0, where A is the matrix, \u03bb is the eigenvalue, I is the identity matrix, and v is the eigenvector.\n\nFirst, I need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is the determinant of (A - \u03bbI) equals zero. So, let's compute A - \u03bbI.\n\nA - \u03bbI = | 2 - \u03bb   1    |\n\n         | 1     2 - \u03bb |\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix is (2 - \u03bb)(2 - \u03bb) - (1)(1) = (2 - \u03bb)^2 - 1.\n\nLet me expand that: (2 - \u03bb)^2 - 1 = 4 - 4\u03bb + \u03bb^2 - 1 = \u03bb^2 - 4\u03bb + 3.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is \u03bb^2 - 4\u03bb + 3 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve for \u03bb. This is a quadratic equation, so I can use the quadratic formula: \u03bb = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 - 12)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(4)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 2] / 2.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb1 = (4 + 2)/2 = 6/2 = 3, and \u03bb2 = (4 - 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are \u03bb1 = 3 and \u03bb2 = 1.\n\nNext, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nLet's start with \u03bb1 = 3.\n\nI need to solve (A - 3I)v = 0.\n\nFirst, compute A - 3I:\n\nA - 3I = | 2 - 3   1   | = | -1   1   |\n\n         | 1     2 - 3 |   | 1    -1  |\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n-1*x + 1*y = 0\n\n1*x - 1*y = 0\n\nBoth equations are essentially the same: -x + y = 0, which implies y = x.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb1 = 3 can be any scalar multiple of |1, 1|.\n\nSo, eigenvector v1 = |1|\n\n                      |1|\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvector for \u03bb2 = 1.\n\nI need to solve (A - I)v = 0.\n\nFirst, compute A - I:\n\nA - I = | 2 - 1   1   | = | 1   1   |\n\n       | 1     2 - 1 |   | 1   1   |\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n1*x + 1*y = 0\n\n1*x + 1*y = 0\n\nAgain, both equations are the same: x + y = 0, which implies y = -x.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb2 = 1 can be any scalar multiple of |1, -1|.\n\nSo, eigenvector v2 = |1|\n\n                      |-1|\n\nJust to summarize:\n\nEigenvalues: \u03bb1 = 3, \u03bb2 = 1\n\nEigenvectors: v1 = |1|, v2 = |1|\n\n                            |1|        |-1|\n\nI should also note that eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, so any non-zero scalar multiple of these vectors would also be acceptable eigenvectors.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(A - \u03bbI) = (2 - \u03bb)^2 - 1*1 = \u03bb^2 - 4\u03bb + 3 = 0.\n\nSolving \u03bb^2 - 4\u03bb + 3 = 0 gives \u03bb = 3 and \u03bb = 1. That seems correct.\n\nFor \u03bb = 3:\n\nA - 3I = |-1  1|\n\n         | 1 -1|\n\nSolving -x + y = 0 gives y = x, so v1 = |1| is correct.\n\n                            |1|\n\nFor \u03bb = 1:\n\nA - I = |1 1|\n\n        |1 1|\n\nSolving x + y = 0 gives y = -x, so v2 = |1| is correct.\n\n                              |-1|\n\nEverything checks out. I think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda_1 = 3 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = 1 \\), with corresponding eigenvectors \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), respectively."
