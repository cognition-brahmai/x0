The second day of meetings begins at the NATO summit in just over an hour from now. It follows the first day of blistering criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump on allies\\' defense spending. He also called Germany captive to Russia for its energy reliance. An emotional reunion in Thailand even separated by glass as those rescued boys are seeing their parents for the first time in weeks. Doctors say most of the boys should be out of the hospital in about a week from now. And new video shows the divers bringing the boys through the cave\\'s flooded and narrow passages. A court in Munich has found a key member of a German neo-Nazi network guilty of killing 10 people and sentenced her to life in prison. Prosecutors said Beate Zschaepe was part of the National Socialist Underground group which killed eight Turks, a Greek citizen and a German police officer 2000 and 2007. > Now back to the moment at the NATO summit when President Trump accused Germany of being captive to Russia. Talk about awkward and not just for European diplomats. The reaction from the President\\'s senior advisers spoke louder than words. Here\\'s Tom Foreman. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Germany is totally controlled by Russia. TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The President\\'s scathing critique of Russia made diplomats cringe, but no more so than his own team. Watch U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison look away from her NATO counterparts squirming. You can see chief of staff John Kelly look away from the President and pucker his mouth. When the President renewed the attack using the word \"captive\" -- TRUMP: Captive to Russia -- FOREMAN: Some turned their heads, some fidgeted, and like that scene in \"The Devil Wears Prada\" -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There\\'s the pursing of the lips. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Which means? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Catastrophe. FOREMAN: Catastrophe may be too much. After all, President Trump has famously given his European counterparts an eyeful of body language before. And when the press secretary was asked about the chief of staff\\'s reaction, she told \"The Washington Post\", Kelly was displeased because he was expecting a full breakfast and there was only pastries and cheese. Still, body language can be louder than words at these international gatherings. When Trump shoved the Prime Minister of Montenegro aside in a photo-op critics and comics erupted. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who does that? FOREMAN: But his fans. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We love it. We\\'re America. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We\\'re rude? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, we\\'re not rude. We\\'re dominant. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That\\'s not rude. After eight he made America great again on the world stage. FOREMAN: Clearly tough body language works for some, but not all. Especially considering the times the President has grabbed for the first lady\\'s hand only to have her push his away. So when the President says he\\'s great at reading people, experts in body language say -- DR. JACK BROWN, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT: He\\'s not as skilled as he claims to be with that, with assessing someone else\\'s body language. He\\'s more like a bull in a China shop. FOREMAN: Certainly it\\'s more art than science figuring out what people mean by the way they hold their body, but the body language of team Trump has absolutely raised a lot of eyebrows around here. Tom Foreman, CNN -- Washington. VAUSE: For more on that NATO summit, Fabrice Pothier is the former NATO director of policy planning and current chief strategy officer at Rasmussen Global. He joins us once more from Brussels. So Fabrice -- only once in the history of NATO has Article 5 been invoked -- the agreement within the alliance that an attack on one member would be considered an attack on all. The date, September 12th, 2001 -- a day after the terror attack on the World Trade Center. Listen to this. GEORGE ROBERTSON, FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL OF NATO: The 19 nations of NATO last night made a historic decision to invoke this Article 5 for the first time in history because of the enormity of what happened. And these nations did so conscious of the fact that this was not just symbolic. It was not just an act of solidarity, although it was both of them. It was also a very clear declaration that this one nation in the alliance has been attacked and they regard that as being an attack on all of them. VAUSE: And then in the days which followed, you know, 200,000 people attended a memorial service at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, there was a moment of silence in the U.K. parliament, there was another moment of silence in the European parliament. I mean the French President at the time Jacques Chirac, the first foreign leader to meet with George W. Bush after the terror attack. And then there was the NATAO commitment of troops in Afghanistan. Given what we saw in Brussels this week, what are the chances NATO would react in the same way if the U.S. was hit by a similar terror attack now? FABRICE POTHIER, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, RASMUSSEN GLOBAL: I think it\\'s quite a speculative question, but you can assume that there would be the same show of solidarity. That, I think, would be pretty clear for most, if not all the allies. However, what you have to remember is, after invoking Article 5 for the first and only time, actually the United States did not ask NATO to do anything more than just invoking Article 5. The then U.S. administration decided to go away in a coalition of the willing in Afghanistan without basically wasting time, according to some people in the administration at the time, with the alliance. So I think it also tells you about the paradox of the alliance showing solidarity with the U.S. But the U.S. not necessarily wanting the alliance\\'s help in doing what it felt that it had to do in Afghanistan. VAUSE: But NATO eventually did turn up in Afghanistan and committed forces there. They remain there to this day. Britain announced it was doubling its troop numbers just this week. POTHIER: Yes. But that was not part of, in a way, Article 5 operation. It was later on that NATO came in and took over a part, and then the whole territory. But the NATO -- the Afghanistan operation started with a coalition of the willing called \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" which is still going on nowadays in parallel to the NATO training mission. So obviously NATO played an important role and helped to sustain the U.S. Presidents in Afghanistan over now more than 15 years. And I will actually recall two years ago when the Obama administration was contemplating withdrawing from Afghanistan, the German chancellor calling on Obama and saying, we\\'ve got to stay, we\\'ve got to finish the job. So it\\'s interesting that Germany was actually a few years ago, the one telling the U.S. we\\'ve got to, you know, stay and finish the job in Afghanistan. VAUSE: Ok, so when this president asks on Twitter, what good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? What is the answer? POTHIER: Well, the answer is not going to be as straightforward as a tweet. NATO is good for the U.S. because it gives it -- to the U.S., a group of friends. And it allows the U.S. to do a little bit less when it\\'s engaged in some operations in the wider Middle East like you see in Afghanistan. It\\'s obviously not always ideal. I think the U.S. would wish there would be more European troops deployed that already the thousands of European troops deployed mean that you don\\'t have to put thousands of American troops. That\\'s one important. The second thing is that, and this is probably the most important, NATO gives an important credibility and international legitimacy to whatever the U.S. wants to do. So U.S. alone is, I think, practically possible, but in terms of international perceptions and legitimacy, it\\'s always more difficult to manage. So it\\'s good to have a group of friends and to have this group of friends in a military organization that puts together operations and deployment. VAUSE: Here\\'s a Gallup poll from January. It reads, \"One year into Donald Trump\\'s presidency, the image of U.S. leadership is weaker worldwide than it was under his two predecessors\" -- this is Donald Trump. Meaning approval of U.S. leadership across 134 countries and areas stands at a new low of 30 percent. You know, some would argue, what does it matter? Estonia or Germany, for example can\\'t go vote for a U.S. President but there are consequences when there\\'s a lack of global goodwill towards the U.S. POTHIER: Absolutely. Starting with defense spending. And I know that some leaders have warned Donald Trump already when he started talking about 2 percent last year saying, the more you push this argument down our throat, the more difficult it\\'s going to be for us as heads of argument to argue for more defense spending with our taxpayers because if we have to do it for Donald Trump, taxpayers will not want it. So there\\'s indeed some toxicity. VAUSE: You know, I\\'m sorry -- we\\'re almost out of time. I want to get to this last question because after Brussels, the President goes to the U.K. And then he\\'s off to Helsinki to meet Vladimir Putin. He says that could quite be easy, the easiest part of this overseas trip. It will be easy if he doesn\\'t call Putin out for election meddling and other issues. What happens and what will be the reaction within NATO if Donald Trump turns up to Helsinki and gives a great big bro hug to Vladimir Putin? Especially in the context of how he\\'s been for the last day or so at the NATO summit? POTHIER: Well, everybody\\'s nervous. Everybody\\'s always nervous when the U.S. has a summit with Russia because we feel that Europe will be given away but even more with this president. The question is how much damage he can do. He\\'s VAUSE: Ok. Fabrice -- hey thank you so much. We appreciate you being with us for both hours, two interesting topics of discussion. So thank you, sir. POTHIER: Thank you. All right. VAUSE: Republicans in Congress seem to be having second thoughts about President Trump\\'s use of trade tariffs especially when applied against allies. The U.S. Senate voted 88 to 11 on Wednesday that the President should get congressional approval before imposing tariffs in the name of national security. Mostly a symbolic gesture as the resolution was non-binding. But it did speak to the disapproval many lawmakers feel towards Donald Trump\\'s policies. Asian markets are back in positive territory after Wednesday\\'s sell off. But in New York, the Dow Jones index was down almost 220 points at the close. At least some of that was pessimism due to the White House planning another round of tariffs, this time on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Andrew Stevens is covering all this for us in Seoul, South Korea. Andrew -- $200 billion, that\\'s actually more than the total amount of U.S. exports to China. So what will the Chinese be able to do in this sort of tit for tat war if they want to match those tariffs? ANDREW STEVENS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we don\\'t know exactly what the details are at this stage, John. But the Chinese are very clear in the fact that they would take countermeasures against this new plan by Donald Trump to impose $200 billion, or 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of exports coming in from China. What we know at this stage is it\\'s going to take a few weeks before this comes into play, if it, in fact, does come into play. There has to be a consultation period in the U.S. But China making no bones about the fact that it will respond. So how would it respond? As you say, $200 billion is quite a lot more than the total amount of U.S. exports to China, around about $130 billion. So what the Chinese could do, things like instead of whacking 10 percent tariffs so it would match the U.S., it could increase the level of tariffs quite significantly. It could also do other non-tariff sort of action. This could be just making it much more difficult for U.S. companies to operate in the U.S. It could put new regulatory hurdles in the way. It could stop purchases of U.S. goods, government purchases of U.S. goods. It could bring about a public boycott of U.S. goods. So it does have various methods at its disposal. And what it would do quite likely, though, is antagonize Donald Trump to the point where he could easily follow through on his earlier threats to increase that $200 billion to $500 billion, John. And then you have major, major trouble between the world\\'s two biggest economies, which would obviously bleed across global economic performance. And you know, it would be a very, very tough outlook for the global economy in general. VAUSE: What are those -- what\\'s the possibility that the Chinese could actually pressure its trading partners to go after U.S. exports, imposing their own tariffs or, you know, trying to reduce those exports which they buy from the United States? STEVENS: Well, that\\'s a dangerous game, particularly with this administration. If China tries to get other countries that it\\'s close to -- to start doing sort of countermeasures against the U.S., given the fact that the U.S. is still such an important export market to so many countries. I mean the question is really can the U.S. or can China withstand the pain? Who can withstand the pain of a much escalated trade war easiest? Now if you talk to economists, if that $200 billion, the tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods comes into play, John, you\\'re talking potentially of a drop in growth in China from 6.8 percent to about 6.4 percent, which is a significant fall. Now the Chinese have the advantage of being able to wear that, because, a, they\\'ve got massive amounts of reserves they can throw money at the economy to soften the blow if they wanted to. And Xi Jinping doesn\\'t have to worry about what the voters think. Whereas Donald Trump very much does have to worry about what the voters are doing. Just interestingly, on that point, the Brookings Institution did a survey looking at that $200 billion worth of goods, what industries it would affect. And it would affect those industries which employed about 2.1 million people in the U.S., across about 3,000 counties. Interestingly, John, in those 300,000 VAUSE: We\\'re out of time, but you know, yes, the U.S. may have the advantage in one trade war on one front, but they\\'re fighting up front on four different fronts in the E.U., Canada and Mexico, everywhere. So I wonder -- you know, it makes you wonder how they\\'re going to win this trade war. Andrew -- thank you. Good to see you. Still to come here, a hard-won victory in extra time has given Croatia their first trip to the World Cup final. But the French, they\\'re hungry -- hungry for the title too.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
