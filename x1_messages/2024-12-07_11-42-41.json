        "content": "So I've got this quadratic function: f(x) = -2(x - 3)^2 + 4. I need to find its vertex and the axis of symmetry. I remember that quadratic functions are graphed as parabolas, and the vertex is like the highest or lowest point of the parabola, depending on whether it's opening up or down. The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex and divides the parabola into two mirror images.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the vertex. The function is given in what looks like vertex form, which is f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Comparing this with my function, f(x) = -2(x - 3)^2 + 4, I can see that h = 3 and k = 4. So, the vertex should be at the point (3, 4).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The general vertex form is f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, and in my function, it's f(x) = -2(x - 3)^2 + 4. Yes, h is 3 and k is 4, so the vertex is (3, 4). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the axis of symmetry. I know that for a parabola, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. Since the vertex is at x = 3, the axis of symmetry should be the line x = 3. That makes sense because in the vertex form, the axis of symmetry is always x = h.\n\nLet me confirm this by recalling another way to find the axis of symmetry. I remember that for a quadratic function in standard form, f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, the axis of symmetry is x = -b/(2a). But my function is already in vertex form, so it's easier to just read off the h value.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can convert this vertex form into standard form and then use the formula to find the axis of symmetry. Let's see:\n\nStart with f(x) = -2(x - 3)^2 + 4.\n\nFirst, expand (x - 3)^2: (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nNow, multiply by -2: -2(x^2 - 6x + 9) = -2x^2 + 12x - 18.\n\nThen, add 4: -2x^2 + 12x - 18 + 4 = -2x^2 + 12x - 14.\n\nSo, in standard form, a = -2, b = 12, and c = -14.\n\nNow, using the formula for the axis of symmetry: x = -b/(2a) = -12/(2*(-2)) = -12/-4 = 3.\n\nOkay, so I get x = 3 again, which matches what I got earlier from the vertex form. That's reassuring. It looks like whether I use the vertex form or convert to standard form and use the formula, I end up with the same axis of symmetry.\n\nAlso, since the coefficient a is negative (-2), I know that the parabola opens downwards, which means the vertex is the maximum point of the parabola.\n\nJust to make sure I understand this completely, let's consider what would happen if a were positive. If a were positive, the parabola would open upwards, and the vertex would be the minimum point.\n\nIn this case, with a = -2, the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex at (3, 4) is the highest point.\n\nAlright, I think I've got a good grasp on this. The vertex is (3, 4), and the axis of symmetry is x = 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe vertex of the quadratic function \\( f(x) = -2(x - 3)^2 + 4 \\) is \\(\\boxed{(3, 4)}\\), and the axis of symmetry is \\(\\boxed{x = 3}\\)."
