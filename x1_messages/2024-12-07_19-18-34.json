Alice has more money than Bob.\n\n2. Alice has less money than Carol.\n\n3. Dave has more money than Carol.\n\nWe need to determine who has the least amount of money among them.\n\nFirst, let's try to arrange their amounts based on the given information.\n\nFrom point 1: Alice > Bob\n\nFrom point 2: Carol > Alice\n\nFrom point 3: Dave > Carol\n\nCombining these, we get:\n\nDave > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\nSo, the order from the most money to the least is Dave, Carol, Alice, and Bob.\n\nTherefore, Bob has the least amount of money.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure there are no inconsistencies.\n\nGiven that Alice has more than Bob but less than Carol, that places Alice between Bob and Carol in terms of money amount.\n\nAdditionally, Dave has more than Carol, so he is at the top.\n\nThus, the sequence is indeed Dave > Carol > Alice > Bob.\n\nHence, Bob has the least amount of money.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bob}} \\]"
