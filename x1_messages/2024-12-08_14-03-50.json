Hmm, let's break it down step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the exponentiation. 3^2 means 3 multiplied by itself, so that's 3 * 3, which equals 9.\n\nNow, the expression looks like this: (9 * 4) / (6 - 2) + 10.\n\nNext, I should do the multiplication and division from left to right, and similarly for addition and subtraction.\n\nSo, inside the numerator, I have 9 * 4, which is 36.\n\nIn the denominator, 6 - 2 is 4.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to 36 / 4 + 10.\n\nDividing 36 by 4 gives me 9.\n\nSo now it's 9 + 10.\n\nAdding those together gives me 19.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet's go through it again.\n\nStarting with (3^2 * 4) / (6 - 2) + 10.\n\nFirst, exponentiation: 3^2 = 9.\n\nThen, multiplication: 9 * 4 = 36.\n\nNext, subtraction in the denominator: 6 - 2 = 4.\n\nNow, division: 36 / 4 = 9.\n\nFinally, addition: 9 + 10 = 19.\n\nSeems consistent. I think the answer is 19.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
