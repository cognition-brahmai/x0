        "content": "So the e-commerce company wants to improve its delivery times by opening more distribution centers. They currently have 5 centers serving 2 million people, and they want to reduce delivery times by 25%. To achieve this, they need to increase the number of distribution centers by 40%. I need to calculate the total number of new distribution centers required and estimate the potential increase in operational costs associated with this expansion. The current annual operating cost per center is $1 million.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many new distribution centers are required. They want to increase the number of centers by 40%. So, I'll calculate 40% of the current number of centers, which is 5.\n\n40% of 5 is calculated as:\n\n0.40 * 5 = 2\n\nSo, they need to open 2 new distribution centers.\n\nWait a minute, but increasing by 40% of 5 is 2, but 5 + 2 = 7, which is a 40% increase from 5. Let me confirm that.\n\nPercentage increase is calculated as:\n\n( increase / original number ) * 100%\n\nSo, if they add 2 centers to the original 5, that's:\n\n(2 / 5) * 100% = 40%\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of centers after the increase by multiplying the original number by 1 plus the percentage increase in decimal form.\n\nSo, 5 * 1.40 = 7 centers.\n\nTherefore, they need to open 2 new centers to reach a total of 7 centers.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the potential increase in operational costs associated with this expansion.\n\nGiven that the current annual operating cost per center is $1 million, I can calculate the additional cost by multiplying the number of new centers by the operating cost per center.\n\nAdditional cost = number of new centers * operating cost per center\n\nAdditional cost = 2 * $1,000,000 = $2,000,000\n\nSo, the potential increase in operational costs is $2 million per year.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? For example, are there any economies of scale or other factors that might affect the operating cost per center when they add new centers?\n\nThe problem states to assume the current annual operating cost per center is $1 million, so I'll stick with that.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that reducing delivery times by 25% requires increasing the number of distribution centers by 40%. This suggests that there's a specific relationship between the number of centers and delivery times.\n\nBut for this problem, I don't need to delve into that relationship, as the required increase in the number of centers is already provided.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Current number of distribution centers: 5\n\n- Required increase: 40%\n\n- Number of new centers: 2\n\n- Total number of centers after expansion: 7\n\n- Increase in operational costs: $2 million per year\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ new distribution centers, with an increase in operational costs of } \\$2,000,000 \\text{ per year}} \\]"
