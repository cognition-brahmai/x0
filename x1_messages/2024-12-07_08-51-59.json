        "content": "So the problem is: a baker uses 2 eggs to make 12 cupcakes. How many eggs does he need to make 100 cupcakes? Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cupcakes. The problem says that 2 eggs are used for 12 cupcakes. So, I can think of this as a ratio or a proportion problem.\n\nStep 1: Find out how many eggs are needed for one cupcake.\n\nIf 2 eggs make 12 cupcakes, then the number of eggs per cupcake is 2 eggs divided by 12 cupcakes. That is:\n\n2 eggs \u00f7 12 cupcakes = 1/6 egg per cupcake\n\nSo, each cupcake requires 1/6 of an egg.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of eggs needed for 100 cupcakes.\n\nIf one cupcake requires 1/6 of an egg, then 100 cupcakes would require:\n\n100 cupcakes \u00d7 (1/6 egg per cupcake) = 100/6 eggs\n\nSimplifying 100/6, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n100 \u00f7 2 = 50\n\n6 \u00f7 2 = 3\n\nSo, 50/3 eggs\n\nStep 3: Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number.\n\n50 divided by 3 is 16 with a remainder of 2, because 3 \u00d7 16 = 48, and 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nTherefore, 50/3 eggs is the same as 16 and 2/3 eggs.\n\nSo, the baker needs 16 and 2/3 eggs to make 100 cupcakes.\n\nBut, in practical terms, the baker can't use a fraction of an egg. So, he would probably need to use 17 eggs, rounding up to the nearest whole egg.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf he uses 16 eggs, that would be:\n\n16 eggs \u00d7 (12 cupcakes per 2 eggs) = 16 \u00f7 2 = 8 sets of 12 cupcakes, which is 96 cupcakes.\n\nBut we need 100 cupcakes, so that's not enough.\n\nIf he uses 17 eggs:\n\n17 \u00f7 2 = 8.5 sets of 12 cupcakes.\n\n8 sets would give 96 cupcakes, and the remaining 0.5 set would give 6 cupcakes (since 12 \u00d7 0.5 = 6).\n\nSo, total cupcakes: 96 + 6 = 102 cupcakes.\n\nThat's more than 100, but better than not having enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me try another method.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of eggs needed per dozen cupcakes.\n\nSince 2 eggs make 12 cupcakes, that's 2 eggs per dozen.\n\nStep 2: Find out how many dozens are in 100 cupcakes.\n\n100 cupcakes \u00f7 12 cupcakes per dozen = 8.333... dozens\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total eggs needed.\n\n8.333... dozens \u00d7 2 eggs per dozen = 16.666... eggs\n\nWhich is the same as 16 and 2/3 eggs.\n\nAgain, practically, the baker would need to use 17 eggs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of proportions.\n\nSet up a proportion:\n\n2 eggs / 12 cupcakes = x eggs / 100 cupcakes\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = (2 eggs \u00d7 100 cupcakes) / 12 cupcakes\n\nx = 200/12 eggs\n\nSimplify 200/12:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n200 \u00f7 4 = 50\n\n12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\nSo, x = 50/3 eggs, which is again 16 and 2/3 eggs.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the baker needs 16 and 2/3 eggs to make 100 cupcakes.\n\nIn practice, since you can't use a fraction of an egg, the baker would need to use 17 eggs.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a way to be more precise or to check this another way.\n\nLet me consider the number of eggs per cupcake again.\n\n2 eggs for 12 cupcakes means each cupcake requires 2/12 = 1/6 egg.\n\nSo, for 100 cupcakes, it's 100 \u00d7 (1/6) = 100/6 = 16.666... eggs.\n\nAgain, 16 and 2/3 eggs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many cupcakes one egg can make.\n\nIf 2 eggs make 12 cupcakes, then one egg makes 6 cupcakes.\n\nSo, if one egg makes 6 cupcakes, how many eggs are needed for 100 cupcakes?\n\nLet's see:\n\nNumber of eggs = 100 cupcakes \u00f7 6 cupcakes per egg = 16.666... eggs\n\nSame result again.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 16 and 2/3 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 16 and 2/3 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16 \\frac{2}{3}} \\]"
