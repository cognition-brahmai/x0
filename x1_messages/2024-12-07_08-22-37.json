        "content": "So I've got this math problem here: (3^2 - 4) * (6 / 2) + 5 * (2 + 1). Hmm, let's see how to tackle this. I remember that in math problems like these, there's a specific order I need to follow, called the order of operations. I think it's often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS or something like that. Let me recall: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, first things first, I need to handle what's inside the parentheses. There are two sets here: (3^2 - 4) and (2 + 1). Let's start with the first one: (3^2 - 4). Inside here, I have an exponent and a subtraction. According to PEMDAS, exponents come before subtraction, so I'll calculate 3^2 first.\n\n3^2 is 3 multiplied by itself, which is 9. So, that part becomes (9 - 4). Now, subtracting 4 from 9 gives me 5. So, (3^2 - 4) simplifies to 5.\n\nNext, the second set of parentheses: (2 + 1). That's straightforward; 2 plus 1 is 3. So, that simplifies to 3.\n\nNow, the expression has simplified to: 5 * (6 / 2) + 5 * 3.\n\nNext up, I need to handle the multiplication and division from left to right. So, first, I see (6 / 2). Division comes first because it's before multiplication in the order. 6 divided by 2 is 3. So, that part becomes 5 * 3.\n\nNow, the expression is: 5 * 3 + 5 * 3.\n\nNext, I perform the multiplications. 5 multiplied by 3 is 15, and again, 5 multiplied by 3 is another 15. So, now the expression is: 15 + 15.\n\nFinally, adding those together: 15 plus 15 equals 30.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 30.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't miss anything. Let's go through it step by step again.\n\nOriginal expression: (3^2 - 4) * (6 / 2) + 5 * (2 + 1)\n\nFirst, parentheses:\n\n- (3^2 - 4) = (9 - 4) = 5\n\n- (2 + 1) = 3\n\nSo, expression becomes: 5 * (6 / 2) + 5 * 3\n\nNext, division:\n\n- 6 / 2 = 3\n\nNow, expression is: 5 * 3 + 5 * 3\n\nThen, multiplications:\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n- 15 + 15 = 30\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think 30 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
