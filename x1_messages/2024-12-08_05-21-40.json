        "content": "Social constructionism is a theory in sociology that suggests that social phenomena are not fixed or natural but are created, institutionalized, and made into tradition by humans through their interactions and shared understandings. It emphasizes that the reality we perceive is shaped by our social and cultural contexts rather than being an objective, independent entity. So, among the options provided, the closest definition is:\n\nB. The idea that social phenomena are created, institutionalized, and made into tradition by humans.\n\nHowever, to provide a more comprehensive understanding, social constructionism argues that categories of people, objects, events, and even emotions are not given by nature but are constructed through social processes. For example, concepts like gender, race, mental illness, and even the self are seen as socially constructed because they are defined and shaped by cultural norms, language, and social interactions.\n\nThis theory is often associated with the work of scholars like Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, who in their book \"The Social Construction of Reality\" (1966), detailed how individuals collectively create their social reality through social interaction. They argued that reality is a dynamic process that is continually being constructed and reconstructed through our daily interactions.\n\nSocial constructionism also has implications for understanding power dynamics in society. Since social constructs are created and maintained by social processes, they can be influenced by those with power and authority, leading to the perpetuation of certain norms and ideologies.\n\nIn contrast to social constructionism, other sociological perspectives might view society as organized in specific ways (option A), focus on social interactions and their impact on individuals (option C), or emphasize inequality and conflict as fundamental aspects of society (option D). While these perspectives are not mutually exclusive, social constructionism provides a unique lens through which to understand how societal norms and categories are formed and maintained.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question, the term \"social constructionism\" in sociology refers to the idea that social phenomena are created, institutionalized, and made into tradition by humans through their social interactions and shared understandings.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nBerger, P.
