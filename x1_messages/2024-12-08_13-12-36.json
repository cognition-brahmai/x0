        "content": "In ancient days, when the world was young,\nAnd the forests stretched wide and strong,\nThere stood a realm where the trees did sing,\nA place of wonder, a fairy ring.\n\nIn the heart of the woods, where the light did play,\nLived the wise old trees, in their ancient way.\nWith roots deep set in the earth's rich soil,\nThey whispered secrets, both old and foul.\n\nThe leaves did rustle, like voices soft,\nTelling tales of times long forgot.\nOf dragons fierce and of elves so fair,\nAnd the battles fought, beyond compare.\n\nThe forest paths, winding and vague,\nLed travelers to places strange.\nThrough misty glades and shadowy dells,\nWhere moonlight danced on sparkling wells.\n\nIn the canopy above, birds took flight,\nTheir songs a melody, pure and bright.\nSquirrels chattered, and rabbits played,\nIn this woodland realm, where nature's charms were displayed.\n\nBut beware the dark corners, where shadows dwell,\nFor there lurk creatures, both wild and well.\nOgres and trolls, with hearts of stone,\nGuarding treasures, their own alone.\n\nYet, in the heart of the forest, a glade so bright,\nWhere sunlight filtered, in beams of light.\nThere danced the Dryads, with laughter sweet,\nTheir beauty enchanting, their presence complete.\n\nOh, forests fair, with your timeless grace,\nYou hold within you, a sacred space.\nA place where magic and wonder abide,\nIn the heart of the woods, where the spirits reside.\n\nSo venture forth, if your courage holds,\nInto the forest, where legends unfold.\nBut remember always, to tread with care,\nFor in the woods, both joy and peril await you there.\n\n**Finis**"
