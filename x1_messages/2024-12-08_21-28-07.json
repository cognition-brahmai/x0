        "content": "I believe the animal you're referring to is the giraffe. Giraffes are indeed known for their exceptionally long necks and distinctive spotted coats. They are the tallest living terrestrial animals on Earth, with some individuals reaching heights of up to 18 feet (approximately 5.5 meters). Their long necks allow them to reach leaves and buds high up in trees, which other herbivores can't access. Each giraffe's coat pattern is unique, similar to human fingerprints, which helps in identifying individual animals. They are native to the African continent and are found in various savanna and woodland habitats."
