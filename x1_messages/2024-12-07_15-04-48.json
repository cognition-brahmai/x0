        "content": "Let's tackle this bacteria growth problem. So, we've got a colony that doubles every 6 hours, and we start with 500 bacteria. We need to find out how many there will be after 2 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the time frames involved. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days would be 48 hours. The colony doubles every 6 hours, so I should figure out how many 6-hour periods there are in 48 hours.\n\nTo find that, I can divide 48 by 6:\n\n48 \u00f7 6 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 doubling periods in 2 days.\n\nNow, starting with 500 bacteria, and doubling every 6 hours for 8 times, I need to calculate the final population.\n\nI recall that exponential growth can be modeled by the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount \u00d7 (growth rate)^(number of periods)\n\nIn this case, the growth rate is doubling, which is a multiplication by 2 each period.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nFinal amount = 500 \u00d7 2^8\n\nFirst, calculate 2^8:\n\n2^8 = 256\n\nThen multiply by the initial amount:\n\n500 \u00d7 256 = 128,000\n\nWait, that seems really big. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 500 bacteria:\n\nAfter 6 hours: 500 \u00d7 2 = 1,000\n\nAfter 12 hours: 1,000 \u00d7 2 = 2,000\n\nAfter 18 hours: 2,000 \u00d7 2 = 4,000\n\nAfter 24 hours: 4,000 \u00d7 2 = 8,000\n\nAfter 30 hours: 8,000 \u00d7 2 = 16,000\n\nAfter 36 hours: 16,000 \u00d7 2 = 32,000\n\nAfter 42 hours: 32,000 \u00d7 2 = 64,000\n\nAfter 48 hours: 64,000 \u00d7 2 = 128,000\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, after 2 days, there would be 128,000 bacteria.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother method could be to use the exponential growth formula:\n\nN = N0 \u00d7 e^(kt)\n\nWhere:\n\nN is the final amount\n\nN0 is the initial amount\n\nk is the growth rate\n\nt is time\n\nHowever, in this problem, the growth is discrete, doubling every 6 hours, so the first method seems more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to find the continuous growth rate, I could use this formula, but it's unnecessary for this problem since the growth is specified in discrete intervals.\n\nLet me also consider if the doubling time is exact or if there's any variability, but the problem states that it doubles every 6 hours, so I can assume it's a constant rate.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any limitations to growth, like resource constraints or space, but the problem doesn't mention any limitations, so I can assume unlimited growth within this time frame.\n\nFurthermore, I should ensure that the time units are consistent. The doubling time is in hours, and the total time is in days, so converting days to hours was necessary, which I did correctly.\n\nLet me also verify the calculation of the number of periods:\n\n2 days = 48 hours\n\n48 hours \u00f7 6 hours per period = 8 periods\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, calculating the final amount:\n\n500 \u00d7 2^8 = 500 \u00d7 256 = 128,000\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nI can also consider logarithms to solve for the final amount, but that would be more complicated than necessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the formula for exponential growth with discrete compounding:\n\nN = N0 \u00d7 (1 + r)^t\n\nWhere r is the growth rate per period, and t is the number of periods.\n\nIn this case, since the population doubles every period, r would be 1 (because it increases by 100%), so:\n\nN = 500 \u00d7 (1 + 1)^8 = 500 \u00d7 2^8 = 128,000\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, after 2 days, the bacteria population would be 128,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{128000} \\]"
