The problem says that Alice has twice as many apples as Bob, and Claire has half as many apples as Bob. Hmm.\n\nAlright, first I need to assign variables to the number of apples each person has. Let's say:\n\n- Let B represent the number of apples Bob has.\n\n- Then, Alice has twice as many as Bob, so Alice has 2B apples.\n\n- Claire has half as many as Bob, so Claire has B/2 apples.\n\nNow, together they have 42 apples, so I can write an equation that adds up their apples:\n\nAlice's apples + Bob's apples + Claire's apples = 42\n\nSubstituting the variables:\n\n2B + B + B/2 = 42\n\nOkay, now I need to solve for B.\n\nFirst, let's combine like terms. 2B + B is 3B, and then plus B/2.\n\nSo, 3B + B/2 = 42\n\nTo make it easier, I can combine 3B and B/2. But to do that, I need a common denominator.\n\n3B is the same as 6B/2, so:\n\n6B/2 + B/2 = 7B/2\n\nSo, 7B/2 = 42\n\nNow, to solve for B, I can multiply both sides by 2:\n\n7B = 84\n\nThen, divide both sides by 7:\n\nB = 12\n\nSo, Bob has 12 apples.\n\nNow, Alice has twice as many as Bob, so Alice has 2 * 12 = 24 apples.\n\nClaire has half as many as Bob, so Claire has 12 / 2 = 6 apples.\n\nLet's check if together they add up to 42:\n\n24 (Alice) + 12 (Bob) + 6 (Claire) = 42\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice has 24 apples, Bob has 12 apples, and Claire has 6 apples.}} \\]"
