        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100, and the postman delivers mail to houses that are multiples of 3 or 5 but not both. So, we need to find out how many houses get mail under this condition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to be a multiple of 3 or 5 but not both. That means houses that are multiples of 3 only, or multiples of 5 only, but not multiples of both 3 and 5.\n\nI know that multiples of 3 are numbers like 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on. Similarly, multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. Now, multiples of both 3 and 5 would be multiples of 15, because 15 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5. So, houses like 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 are multiples of both.\n\nThe condition is to deliver mail to houses that are multiples of 3 or 5 but not both. That means we need to exclude those houses that are multiples of both, i.e., multiples of 15.\n\nSo, maybe I can find the number of houses that are multiples of 3, add the number of houses that are multiples of 5, and then subtract twice the number of houses that are multiples of 15. Wait, why twice?\n\nLet me think again. If I add the multiples of 3 and the multiples of 5, I'm including the multiples of 15 twice, once in each. But I want to exclude those houses that are multiples of both. So, perhaps I should add the multiples of 3 and the multiples of 5, and then subtract the multiples of 15.\n\nBut the problem says \"or 5 but not both,\" which means we want houses that are multiples of 3 alone or multiples of 5 alone, excluding those that are multiples of both.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\n(Number of multiples of 3) + (Number of multiples of 5) - 2*(Number of multiples of 15)\n\nBecause we want to exclude the houses that are multiples of both completely from the count.\n\nWait, maybe another way to think about it is:\n\n- Find the number of houses that are multiples of 3 but not 5.\n\n- Find the number of houses that are multiples of 5 but not 3.\n\n- Add them together.\n\nSo, it would be:\n\n(Number of multiples of 3 not multiples of 5) + (Number of multiples of 5 not multiples of 3)\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nFirst, find the number of multiples of 3 from 1 to 100.\n\nTo find the number of multiples of 3, we can divide 100 by 3 and take the integer part.\n\n100 \u00f7 3 = 33.333..., so there are 33 multiples of 3.\n\nSimilarly, for multiples of 5:\n\n100 \u00f7 5 = 20, so there are 20 multiples of 5.\n\nNow, the multiples of both 3 and 5 are multiples of 15.\n\n100 \u00f7 15 = 6.666..., so there are 6 multiples of 15.\n\nNow, the number of houses that are multiples of 3 but not 5 would be:\n\nNumber of multiples of 3 - Number of multiples of 15 = 33 - 6 = 27\n\nSimilarly, the number of houses that are multiples of 5 but not 3 would be:\n\nNumber of multiples of 5 - Number of multiples of 15 = 20 - 6 = 14\n\nNow, add these two together:\n\n27 + 14 = 41\n\nSo, 41 houses receive mail.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe total number of houses that are multiples of 3 or 5 is:\n\nNumber of multiples of 3 + Number of multiples of 5 - Number of multiples of both (i.e., 15)\n\nSo, 33 + 20 - 6 = 47\n\nBut this includes houses that are multiples of both 3 and 5.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"or 5 but not both,\" which means we need to exclude those houses that are multiples of both.\n\nSo, from the 47, we need to subtract the 6 houses that are multiples of both.\n\nTherefore, 47 - 6 = 41\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we could have directly added the houses that are multiples of 3 only and those that are multiples of 5 only, which is what I did first.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nLet me try to verify this with a smaller set to ensure I'm correct.\n\nSuppose there are 15 houses numbered from 1 to 15.\n\nMultiples of 3: 3,6,9,12,15 (5 houses)\n\nMultiples of 5: 5,10,15 (3 houses)\n\nMultiples of both: 15 (1 house)\n\nNow, applying the same logic:\n\nMultiples of 3 only: 5 - 1 = 4\n\nMultiples of 5 only: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nTotal houses that receive mail: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal multiples of 3 or 5: 5 + 3 - 1 = 7\n\nBut we need to exclude those that are multiples of both, so 7 - 1 = 6\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with 100 houses, the answer should be 41 houses receive mail.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41} \\]"
