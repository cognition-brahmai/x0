        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find out how much total revenue the restaurant generates in a week from selling hamburgers and hot dogs.\n\nFirst, we know that the restaurant sells 120 hamburgers each day, and each hamburger is priced at $6. So, the daily revenue from hamburgers would be the number of hamburgers sold multiplied by the price per hamburger. That is:\n\nDaily hamburger revenue = 120 hamburgers * $6/hamburger\n\nSimilarly, the restaurant sells 80 hot dogs each day, with each hot dog priced at $4. So, the daily revenue from hot dogs would be:\n\nDaily hot dog revenue = 80 hot dogs * $4/hot dog\n\nOnce we have the daily revenue from both hamburgers and hot dogs, we can add them together to get the total daily revenue.\n\nTotal daily revenue = Daily hamburger revenue + Daily hot dog revenue\n\nNow, to find the weekly revenue, we need to multiply the total daily revenue by the number of days in a week. Assuming a week has 7 days, the weekly revenue would be:\n\nWeekly revenue = Total daily revenue * 7 days\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the daily hamburger revenue:\n\n120 hamburgers * $6/hamburger = $720\n\nNext, calculate the daily hot dog revenue:\n\n80 hot dogs * $4/hot dog = $320\n\nNow, add these to get the total daily revenue:\n\n$720 + $320 = $1040\n\nFinally, multiply by 7 to get the weekly revenue:\n\n$1040/day * 7 days = $7280\n\nSo, the restaurant will generate $7280 in revenue in a week from selling hamburgers and hot dogs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7280} \\]"
