        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets at a rate of 200 per hour. It operates for 16 hours a day and is closed on Sundays. I need to find out how many widgets are produced in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days the factory is open. Since it's closed on Sundays, and assuming a standard week, that means it's open 6 days a week (Monday through Saturday).\n\nSo, the number of operating days in a week is 6.\n\nNext, the factory produces 200 widgets per hour, and it operates for 16 hours each day. So, the daily production would be:\n\n200 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day = 3200 widgets/day.\n\nNow, to find the weekly production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of operating days in a week:\n\n3200 widgets/day * 6 days/week = 19,200 widgets/week.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me verify the calculations.\n\nFirst, 200 widgets per hour for 16 hours a day:\n\n200 * 16 = 3200 widgets per day.\n\nThen, 3200 widgets per day for 6 days a week:\n\n3200 * 6 = 19,200 widgets per week.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in total hours operated in a week and then multiply by the production rate.\n\nThe factory operates 16 hours each day for 6 days, so total hours in a week:\n\n16 hours/day * 6 days/week = 96 hours/week.\n\nThen, producing 200 widgets per hour:\n\n200 widgets/hour * 96 hours/week = 19,200 widgets/week.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think 19,200 widgets per week is the correct production amount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19200} \\]"
