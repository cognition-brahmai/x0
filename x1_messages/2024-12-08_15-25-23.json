        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 students in total. Out of these, 12 play soccer, 8 play basketball, and 4 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try.\n\nFirst, there are 12 students who play soccer and 8 who play basketball. But, 4 of them play both sports. So, if I just add 12 and 8, that would be 20, but that includes the 4 who play both twice, once in soccer and once in basketball. So, I need to subtract those 4 to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, the total number of students who play at least one sport is 12 + 8 - 4 = 16.\n\nNow, since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be 20 - 16 = 4.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me draw a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\n- The soccer circle has 12 students.\n\n- The basketball circle has 8 students.\n\n- The overlapping area, where students play both sports, has 4 students.\n\nSo, the part of the soccer circle that doesn't overlap with basketball is 12 - 4 = 8 students.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap with soccer is 8 - 4 = 4 students.\n\nNow, adding up the unique parts and the overlap: 8 (only soccer) + 4 (only basketball) + 4 (both) = 16 students play at least one sport.\n\nTherefore, 20 - 16 = 4 students don't play either sport.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula is:\n\nTotal students = students who play soccer + students who play basketball - students who play both + students who play neither.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n20 = 12 + 8 - 4 + neither.\n\nSolving for neither: 20 - (12 + 8 - 4) = 20 - 16 = 4.\n\nSo, again, 4 students don't play either sport.\n\nI think this is correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I list out the students:\n\n- 12 play soccer:\n\n- Out of these, 4 also play basketball.\n\n- So, 12 - 4 = 8 play only soccer.\n\n- 8 play basketball:\n\n- Out of these, 4 also play soccer.\n\n- So, 8 - 4 = 4 play only basketball.\n\n- 4 play both sports.\n\n- And the remaining students don't play either sport.\n\nTotal students playing at least one sport: 8 (only soccer) + 4 (only basketball) + 4 (both) = 16.\n\nSo, 20 - 16 = 4 students don't play either sport.\n\nYes, this matches my previous conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the students who play soccer and those who play basketball, and account for the overlap, I still get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4 students who don't play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
