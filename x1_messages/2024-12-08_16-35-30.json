        "content": "I'm excited to help you with this project! Creating a Golang program that generates random math problems with varying difficulty levels sounds like a fun and educational tool. Let's break down the requirements and plan out how we can implement this step by step.\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. **Generate Random Math Problems:**\n   - Support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n   - Vary difficulty levels based on user input.\n\n2. **Present Problems to User:**\n   - Display the generated math problem.\n\n3. **Accept User's Answer:**\n   - Read the user's input for the answer.\n\n4. **Provide Feedback:**\n   - Inform the user if their answer is correct or incorrect.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - We can define difficulty levels based on the range of numbers used in the problems.\n   - For example:\n     - Easy: numbers between 1 and 10\n     - Medium: numbers between 11 and 50\n     - Hard: numbers between 51 and 100\n\n2. **Problem Types:**\n   - Addition: a + b\n   - Subtraction: a - b\n   - Multiplication: a * b\n   - Division: a / b (ensure division by zero is handled)\n\n3. **Randomness:**\n   - Randomly select the type of operation.\n   - Randomly select numbers within the difficulty range.\n\n4. **User Interaction:**\n   - Prompt the user to choose a difficulty level.\n   - Present the problem and wait for the user's input.\n   - Provide feedback based on the correctness of the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math/rand\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\n// Difficulty levels and their corresponding number ranges\nvar difficulties = map[string][2]int{\n\t\"easy\":   {1, 10},\n\t\"medium\": {11, 50},\n\t\"hard\":   {51, 100},\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Println(\"Welcome to the Math Problem Generator!\")\n\treader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)\n\n\t// Seed the random number generator\n\trand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())\n\n\t// Prompt user for difficulty level\n\tfmt.Println(\"Choose difficulty level:\")\n\tfor diff, _ := range difficulties {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"-\", diff)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter difficulty level: \")\n\tdifficultyInput, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\tdifficulty := strings.TrimSpace(difficultyInput)\n\n\t// Validate difficulty level\n\trangeNumbers, exists := difficulties[difficulty]\n\tif !exists {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Invalid difficulty level.\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Generate a random math problem\n\toperation := rand.Intn(4) // 0: addition, 1: subtraction, 2: multiplication, 3: division\n\ta := rand.Intn(rangeNumbers[1]-rangeNumbers[0]+1) + rangeNumbers[0]\n\tb := rand.Intn(rangeNumbers[1]-rangeNumbers[0]+1) + rangeNumbers[0]\n\n\tvar problem string\n\tvar correctAnswer float64\n\n\tswitch operation {\n\tcase 0:\n\t\tproblem = fmt.Sprintf(\"%d + %d\", a, b)\n\t\tcorrectAnswer = float64(a + b)\n\tcase 1:\n\t\tproblem = fmt.Sprintf(\"%d - %d\", a, b)\n\t\tcorrectAnswer = float64(a - b)\n\tcase 2:\n\t\tproblem = fmt.Sprintf(\"%d * %d\", a, b)\n\t\tcorrectAnswer = float64(a * b)\n\tcase 3:\n\t\t// Handle division by zero\n\t\tfor b == 0 {\n\t\t\tb = rand.Intn(rangeNumbers[1]-rangeNumbers[0]+1) + rangeNumbers[0]\n\t\t}\n\t\tproblem = fmt.Sprintf(\"%d / %d\", a, b)\n\t\tcorrectAnswer = float64(a) / float64(b)\n\t}\n\n\t// Present the problem to the user\n\tfmt.Println(\"Solve the following problem:\")\n\tfmt.Println(problem)\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter your answer: \")\n\tanswerInput, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\tuserAnswerStr := strings.TrimSpace(answerInput)\n\n\t// Convert user's answer to float64\n\tuserAnswer, err := strconv.ParseFloat(userAnswerStr, 64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Check if the answer is correct, considering floating point precision for division\n\ttolerance := 0.0001\n\tif operation == 3 {\n\t\tif abs(userAnswer-correctAnswer) < tolerance {\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Correct!\")\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is %.2f.\\n\", correctAnswer)\n\t\t}\n\t} else {\n\t\tif userAnswer == correctAnswer {\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Correct!\")\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is %.0f.\\n\", correctAnswer)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n// Helper function to calculate absolute difference\nfunc abs(x float64) float64 {\n\tif x < 0 {\n\t\treturn -x\n\t}\n\treturn x\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - We use a map to associate difficulty levels with number ranges.\n\n2. **Random Problem Generation:**\n   - We randomly select the type of operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n   - Numbers are randomly selected based on the chosen difficulty level.\n\n3. **User Interaction:**\n   - The user is prompted to choose a difficulty level.\n   - The generated problem is displayed, and the user's input is read and evaluated.\n\n4. **Feedback:**\n   - The program checks the user's answer against the correct answer and provides feedback.\n   - For division problems, a tolerance is considered due to floating-point precision issues.\n\nThis program should meet the requirements and provide an interactive way for users to practice their math skills at varying difficulty levels."
