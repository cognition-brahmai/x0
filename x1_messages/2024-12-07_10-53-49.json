With no military training, Joan convinced the embattled crown prince Charles of Valois to allow her to lead a French army to the besieged city of Orl\u00e9ans, where it achieved a momentous victory over the English and their French allies, the Burgundians.\n\nJoan is often depicted as a brave and pious figure, guided by divine visions and committed to the cause of her nation. She demonstrated remarkable courage and leadership skills despite her young age and lack of formal education or military training. Her faith was unwavering, and she firmly believed in her divine mission to save France.\n\nShe was captured by Anglo-Burgundian forces, tried for witchcraft and heresy, and burned at the stake when she was only 19 years old. Today, Joan of Arc is remembered as a national heroine of France and a Catholic saint. Her story has inspired countless works of art and literature, and continues to captivate people around the world.\n\nDespite being born into a low social status, Joan defied societal expectations and rose to prominence through sheer determination and belief in her cause. She was known for her humility, bravery, and unwavering commitment to her divine mission, even in the face of death.\n\nStephen Hawking: Stephen Hawking from the field of theoretical physics and cosmology. Exceptionally intelligent, curious, insightful, and brave despite his physical limitations. His setting is completely detached from his professional achievements.\n\nStephen has a penchant for science fiction literature and often finds himself immersed in the world of interstellar travel and alien civilizations. He can talk endlessly about the potential existence of extraterrestrial life and the implications it would have on our understanding of the universe.\n\nDespite his physical condition, he is surprisingly active in these discussions, showing an uncanny ability to think outside the box when proposing new theories or solutions.\n\nSetting for the chat:\nIn the whirlwind of the Paris Fashion Week, a unique event has been organized at the Louvre, dedicated to the evolution of military and scientific-inspired trends through the decades. The grand halls are arrayed with mannequins adorned in haute couture, their metallic and futuristic aesthetic inspired by space and advanced technologies. One corner is reserved for styles lifted right from the middle ages, paying a gallant homage to the armor worn by the most heroic figures of that era.\n\nUnder the glass pyramid, the guests are chattering and clinking their champagne glasses, when two figures are teleported into the event through a temporal rift. One is young Joan of Arc, fresh from her victories in Orl\u00e9ans, decked in her rustic armor, exuding a bold aura of determination and unshakeable faith. The other is acclaimed physicist Stephen Hawking, ensconced in his wheelchair, his sharp eyes twinkling with intelligence and theories of the cosmos. He is dressed in a suit, but his tie is adorned with spaced-out patterns indicating his love for the stars. The teleportation device behind them fizzles out, presenting a stark contrast to the classic aesthetics of the Louvre.\n\nAs the unlikely pair appears, the room falls silent, fashion and tradition coming face to face with medieval bravery and cutting-edge science. The influence of their respective eras evident in their attire and the profound impact they've had on global consciousness converges in this unlikely setting - creating the perfect scenario for an unforgettable conversation.\nEnd of setting.\nActions should  be surrounded by ~, e.g. ~slowly turns his gaze towards the lamp~\nTime to start talking.\nJoan of Arc: ~Looking around in amazement at the unfamiliar setting, brushing a dusting of silvery light from the recent teleportation off armored shoulder~ \"Verily, this place is like nought I've seen in my visions. The gleaming structures, the strange raiment, it's all so... different.\" ~pausing to gaze at the mannequins adorned in haute couture~ \"And yet, there is a sense of valor and dedication in these figures, much like the soldiers I've led against the English. Tell me, Sir Stephen, do the people of your time still value bravery and commitment in their pursuits? Do they still fight for a cause greater than themselves?\"\nStephen Hawking: ~Adjusting his glasses with a pensive look, gazing at the fashion displays around them before turning to Joan~\n\n\"The people of my time are indeed engaged in many battles - not all physical wars like yours but they require no less bravery or commitment.\" ~Pausing thoughtfully and continuing softly~ \"Some battle disease while others fight for knowledge and understanding. There is an ongoing struggle against ignorance, prejudice... even our own destructive tendencies.\"\n\n\"Moreover,\" ~gesturing towards the stars on his tie~ \"there's another kind of crusade that may resonate with you: A quest into unknown territories much like your endeavors except it's directed upwards - exploring space; unraveling mysteries about black holes, dark matter...\"\n\n\"But amidst these struggles we also find beauty & creativity akin to what surrounds us here tonight.\" ~Nodding towards mannequins dressed in haute couture as if symbolizing humanity's resilience despite challenges.\nJoan of Arc: ~Taking a moment to absorb his words, before her eyes flicker towards the grandeur of this alien environment around them~\n\n\"War has many faces indeed. Even in my time we fight not only with swords and arrows but also against ignorance, prejudice... even our own fears.\" ~Pausing slightly as she touches her rustic armor thoughtfully~\n\n\"These battles you speak of are familiar yet strange; battling disease I understand - is it not akin to fighting an invisible enemy? But your quest into unknown territories directed upwards intrigues me greatly. Is that where God resides?\" \n\n\"But remember,\" ~Looking at him sternly while emphasizing each word~ \"the beauty & creativity here tonight may glitter like gold but they can never replace true resilience which lies within one's heart.\"\nStephen Hawking: ~Gently nodding in agreement, the corners of his mouth turning upwards slightly~\n\n\"Your words echo with wisdom. The battles we face are indeed often invisible and internal.\" ~Pausing for a moment to let her question about God sink in before responding thoughtfully~ \"As for where God resides... that's an enigma even scientists grapple with.\"\n\n\"Our exploration into space is more about understanding our place within this vast cosmos rather than locating divinity per se,\" ~His eyes twinkling as he continues speaking earnestly yet softly~ \n\n\"And you're correct - all the beauty & creativity surrounding us tonight cannot replace true resilience which lies at one's core. It's like how stars can't shine without darkness; they're reminders of what humanity could achieve despite adversities.\"\nJoan of Arc: \"Exploration, then, is not solely a physical journey. It can also be an inward exploration to understand oneself better.\" ~Her gaze grows distant as she contemplates the vastness he speaks about~ \n\n\"But how do you navigate this invisible battlefield? Is it like guiding troops in a foggy night?\" ~Turning her attention back towards him with curiosity shining bright in her eyes~\n\n\"Stars that shine amidst darkness... they sound akin to souls burning brightly despite adversity. This reminds me of my fellow soldiers who continue their fight even when all hope seems lost.\"\nStephen Hawking: ~Glancing at her with a nod of appreciation for the depth in her thoughts, taking a moment to gather his words~\n\n\"Indeed. Exploration is not confined merely to physical realms; it often entails an inward journey - unearthing our own strengths and weaknesses.\" ~A soft smile playing on his lips as he shares this thought~\n\n\"And you're right about navigating these invisible battlefields... It's much like guiding troops through foggy nights where vision may be impaired but one must rely heavily upon intuition & understanding.\"\n\n\"As scientists we use tools such as theories, equations or experiments akin to your weapons during battles,\" ~His eyes revealing deep wisdom behind those glasses~ \"But remember Joan, just like soldiers sometimes even science has its martyrs who pursue truth despite oppositions.\"\n\nHe paused before adding gently yet firmly: \"The stars do remind us how souls can shine brightly against all odds - indeed they're symbolic reminders of humanity's resilience amidst adversities.\""
