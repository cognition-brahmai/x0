        "content": "Let's see. I have to figure out how far I'll travel if I drive at an average speed of 55 miles per hour for 4 hours and 30 minutes. Okay, so the formula to calculate distance is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nI know the speed is 55 miles per hour, and the time is 4 hours and 30 minutes. But wait, time needs to be in hours because the speed is per hour. So, I need to convert 4 hours and 30 minutes into hours.\n\nFirst, let's convert 30 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, 4 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 4.5 hours.\n\nNow, I can plug the values into the formula:\n\nDistance = 55 miles per hour \u00d7 4.5 hours\n\nLet me do the multiplication. 55 times 4 is 220, and 55 times 0.5 is 27.5. So, 220 plus 27.5 is 247.5 miles.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check again. 55 times 4.5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 4.5 as 9/2, so 55 \u00d7 9/2.\n\nFirst, 55 \u00d7 9 is 495, and then divided by 2 is 247.5 miles. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled is 247.5 miles.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check the time conversion. 30 minutes is indeed 0.5 hours, so 4 hours plus 0.5 hours is 4.5 hours. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the entire time into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 240 minutes, plus 30 minutes, totaling 270 minutes.\n\nThen, the speed is 55 miles per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so the speed in miles per minute would be 55/60 miles per minute.\n\nThen, distance would be speed times time: (55/60) miles per minute \u00d7 270 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate that: 55 divided by 60 is approximately 0.9167 miles per minute.\n\nThen, 0.9167 miles per minute times 270 minutes is:\n\n0.9167 \u00d7 270 = 247.5 miles.\n\nAgain, I get 247.5 miles. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that 4 hours and 30 minutes is 4.5 hours, and multiply directly: 55 \u00d7 4.5 = 247.5 miles.\n\nWait, I'm getting the same answer no matter which way I approach it. So, I think it's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another method.\n\nIf I think about the speed in miles per hour, and the time in hours, the units should cancel out to give miles.\n\nSo, 55 miles/hour \u00d7 4.5 hours = 247.5 miles.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of blocks of time.\n\nFor example, in one hour, I travel 55 miles.\n\nSo, in 4 hours, I would travel 55 \u00d7 4 = 220 miles.\n\nThen, in the additional 30 minutes, which is half an hour, I would travel half of 55 miles, which is 27.5 miles.\n\nSo, total distance is 220 + 27.5 = 247.5 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the final answer is 247.5 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{247.5} \\]"
