        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a book has 450 pages, and I read 25 pages per day. But every fifth day, I read twice as much, which would be 50 pages. I need to figure out how long it will take to finish the book. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pattern of reading. Normally, I read 25 pages a day, but every fifth day, I read 50 pages. So, it's like a cycle: four days of 25 pages each, and one day of 50 pages. That makes a five-day cycle.\n\nLet me calculate how many pages I read in one complete cycle. Four days at 25 pages each would be 4 * 25 = 100 pages. Plus one day of 50 pages, so total pages per cycle are 100 + 50 = 150 pages.\n\nNow, the book has 450 pages. So, I can find out how many complete cycles are needed by dividing the total pages by pages per cycle. 450 \u00f7 150 = 3 cycles.\n\nSince each cycle is 5 days, 3 cycles would be 3 * 5 = 15 days.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if there are any leftover pages after these cycles. Let's see: 3 cycles cover 3 * 150 = 450 pages, which is exactly the book's total pages. So, no leftover pages.\n\nTherefore, it should take 15 days to finish the book.\n\nBut let me double-check this approach. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother way is to consider the average pages read per day. Normally, I read 25 pages, but every fifth day, I read 50. So, over five days, I read 150 pages, as before.\n\nThe average per day would be 150 pages / 5 days = 30 pages per day.\n\nThen, to find the total days, I could divide the total pages by the average pages per day: 450 \u00f7 30 = 15 days.\n\nOkay, this matches my previous calculation.\n\nBut maybe I should consider it day by day to be sure.\n\nLet's list out the pages read each day:\n\nDay 1: 25 pages\n\nDay 2: 25 pages\n\nDay 3: 25 pages\n\nDay 4: 25 pages\n\nDay 5: 50 pages\n\nTotal for first cycle: 150 pages\n\nDay 6: 25 pages\n\nDay 7: 25 pages\n\nDay 8: 25 pages\n\nDay 9: 25 pages\n\nDay 10: 50 pages\n\nTotal for second cycle: 150 pages\n\nDay 11: 25 pages\n\nDay 12: 25 pages\n\nDay 13: 25 pages\n\nDay 14: 25 pages\n\nDay 15: 50 pages\n\nTotal for third cycle: 150 pages\n\nTotal pages: 450 pages, which matches the book's length.\n\nSo, it indeed takes 15 days.\n\nWait, but what if the total pages weren't exactly divisible by the cycle pages? Suppose the book had, say, 460 pages. Then, 460 \u00f7 150 = 3 cycles (450 pages), with 10 pages left.\n\nIn that case, I'd need to see how many additional days are required for the remaining 10 pages.\n\nBut in this case, since it's exactly 450 pages, no remainder, so 15 days are sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of geometric series or something, but that seems unnecessary for this linear problem.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can model this with arithmetic sequences.\n\nLet me see.\n\nNormally, without the every fifth day bonus, I'd read 25 pages per day. So, in d days, I'd read 25d pages.\n\nBut every fifth day, I read an extra 25 pages.\n\nHow many fifth days are there in d days? It would be floor(d / 5), assuming d is an integer.\n\nSo, total pages read would be 25d + 25 * floor(d / 5).\n\nSet this equal to 450 and solve for d.\n\nSo, 25d + 25 * floor(d / 5) = 450.\n\nFactor out 25: 25(d + floor(d / 5)) = 450.\n\nDivide both sides by 25: d + floor(d / 5) = 18.\n\nNow, I need to find d such that d + floor(d / 5) = 18.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky.\n\nLet me try plugging in values for d.\n\nStart with d = 15.\n\n15 + floor(15 / 5) = 15 + 3 = 18. Perfect.\n\nSo, d = 15.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWhat if I try d = 14.\n\n14 + floor(14 / 5) = 14 + 2 = 16, which is less than 18.\n\nd = 15: 15 + 3 = 18.\n\nd = 16: 16 + 3 = 19, which is more than 18.\n\nBut since the total pages are exactly 450, d = 15 is the solution.\n\nAlternatively, d = 16 would give more pages than needed.\n\nSo, 15 days is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve d + floor(d / 5) = 18 algebraically.\n\nLet\u2019s set d / 5 = n, where n is an integer since it's floor(d / 5).\n\nThen, d = 5n.\n\nSubstitute back: 5n + n = 18 => 6n = 18 => n = 3.\n\nThen, d = 5 * 3 = 15.\n\nAgain, d = 15.\n\nThis confirms the solution.\n\nSo, it will take 15 days to finish the book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
