Each plan should have an associated evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool is useful in finding an appropriate list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkCollector[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nALM[input]: Answer Language Model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the dog, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the current president of Harvard University and what are their notable achievements?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who the current president of Harvard University is and what their notable achievements are. I think the best way to start is by searching for the current president of Harvard. I can use the Bing search tool for that.\n\nSo, my first plan is to use Bing to search for \"current president of Harvard University.\"\n\n:evidence0: = Bing[\"current president of Harvard University\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to look through the pages to find the name of the president. Probably, the top results will have the information I need. Maybe I should use the LinkCollector tool to extract the relevant links from the search results and then use WebScraper to get the text from those links.\n\nPlan: Use LinkCollector to extract links from the Bing search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkCollector[:evidence0:]\n\nNext, I'll use WebScraper to extract text from these links.\n\nPlan: Use WebScraper to extract text from the collected links.\n\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nNow, with the text from these pages, I need to find the name of the current president. I can probably look for the most frequently mentioned name in relation to Harvard president. Alternatively, I can look for phrases like \"current president\" or \"president of Harvard.\"\n\nOnce I have the name, I need to find their notable achievements. I can either look for this information in the same texts I've already scraped or do another search specifically for the president's achievements.\n\nPlan: Use ALM to extract the name of the current president from :evidence2:.\n\n:evidence3: = ALM[\"Who is the current president of Harvard University? Given :evidence2:\"]\n\nNow that I have the president's name, I can search for their notable achievements.\n\nPlan: Use Bing to search for \"[president's name] notable achievements.\"\n\n:evidence4: = Bing[:evidence3: + \" notable achievements\"]\n\nThen, use LinkCollector to extract links from these search results.\n\nPlan: Use LinkCollector to extract links from :evidence4:.\n\n:evidence5: = LinkCollector[:evidence4:]\n\nUse WebScraper to extract text from these links.\n\nPlan: Use WebScraper to extract text from :evidence5:.\n\n:evidence6: = WebScraper[:evidence5:]\n\nFinally, use ALM to summarize the notable achievements from :evidence6:.\n\nPlan: Use ALM to answer \"What are the notable achievements of [president's name]?\" given :evidence6:.\n\n:evidence7: = ALM[\"What are the notable achievements of \" + :evidence3: + \"? Given :evidence6:\"]\n\nSo, the final answer would be :evidence7:.\n\nBut maybe I can make this more efficient. Instead of searching twice, once for the president's name and then for their achievements, perhaps I can find all the information in the initial search results.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\n1. Use Bing to search for \"current president of Harvard University and their notable achievements.\"\n\n:evidence0: = Bing[\"current president of Harvard University and their notable achievements\"]\n\n2. Use LinkCollector to extract relevant links from the search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkCollector[:evidence0:]\n\n3. Use WebScraper to extract text from these links.\n\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[:evidence1:]\n\n4. Use ALM to answer \"Who is the current president of Harvard University and what are their notable achievements?\" given :evidence2:.\n\n:evidence3: = ALM[\"Who is the current president of Harvard University and what are their notable achievements? Given :evidence2:\"]\n\nThis seems simpler and might save time by reducing the number of steps. I'll go with this alternative plan.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\nPlan: Search for \"current president of Harvard University and their notable achievements\" using Bing.\n\n:evidence0: = Bing[\"current president of Harvard University and their notable achievements\"]\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the search results.\n\n:evidence1: = LinkCollector[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Scrape the text from these links.\n\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Use ALM to answer the question based on the scraped text.\n\n:evidence3: = ALM[\"Who is the current president of Harvard University and what are their notable achievements? Given :evidence2:\"]\n\nAnswer: :evidence3:"
