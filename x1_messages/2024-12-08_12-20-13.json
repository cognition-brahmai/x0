        "content": "So, if someone burns 300 calories per hour while walking, and you want to know how many they'll burn in 45 minutes, right? Well, first, we need to understand that 45 minutes is less than an hour, so they won't burn the full 300 calories. Let's see how to calculate this.\n\nAn hour has 60 minutes, so 45 minutes is 45/60 of an hour. That simplifies to 3/4 of an hour, or 0.75 hours. So, if they burn 300 calories in one hour, in 0.75 hours, they should burn 300 multiplied by 0.75.\n\nLet me do the math: 300 times 0.75. That's the same as 300 times 3 divided by 4. 300 times 3 is 900, and 900 divided by 4 is 225. So, they would burn 225 calories in 45 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Another way to look at it is to find out how many calories they burn per minute and then multiply by 45. If they burn 300 calories in 60 minutes, then per minute it's 300 divided by 60, which is 5 calories per minute. So, 5 calories per minute times 45 minutes is 225 calories again. Okay, that matches.\n\nSo, the person would burn 225 calories in 45 minutes of walking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{225} \\]"
