        "content": "Okay, so we have this problem about a marathon event with 500 participants, and the organizers need to provide water bottles for each runner. There are three sizes: small (12 oz), medium (16 oz), and large (20 oz). They plan to buy twice as many small bottles as large ones and an equal number of medium and large bottles. We need to figure out how many of each size they should purchase.\n\nFirst, I think I should define variables for the number of each size of water bottle. Let's let:\n\n- \\( L \\) represent the number of large bottles (20 oz),\n\n- \\( M \\) represent the number of medium bottles (16 oz),\n\n- \\( S \\) represent the number of small bottles (12 oz).\n\nAccording to the problem, there are twice as many small bottles as large ones, so:\n\n\\[ S = 2L \\]\n\nAlso, the number of medium bottles is equal to the number of large bottles:\n\n\\[ M = L \\]\n\nSince there are 500 participants, and each gets one water bottle, the total number of bottles should be 500:\n\n\\[ S + M + L = 500 \\]\n\nNow, I can substitute the expressions for \\( S \\) and \\( M \\) in terms of \\( L \\) into the total equation:\n\n\\[ 2L + L + L = 500 \\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[ 4L = 500 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{500}{4} = 125 \\]\n\nSo, there are 125 large bottles.\n\nSince \\( M = L \\), there are also 125 medium bottles.\n\nAnd since \\( S = 2L \\), there are \\( 2 \\times 125 = 250 \\) small bottles.\n\nTo check, let's add them up: 250 small + 125 medium + 125 large = 500, which matches the total number of participants.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any constraint based on the size or ounces, but the problem doesn't specify any total ounces, only the number of bottles per size relative to each other and the total number of bottles.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n- Small bottles: 250\n\n- Medium bottles: 125\n\n- Large bottles: 125\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250 \\text{ small}, 125 \\text{ medium}, 125 \\text{ large}} \\]"
