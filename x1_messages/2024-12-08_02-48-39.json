        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that reads a text file with lines of space-separated integers, calculates the sum of each line, and then writes those sums to a new output file, each sum on its own line. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a Java project. Since I'm using IntelliJ IDEA, I'll create a new Java class for this program. Let's call it `SumCalculator`.\n\nNow, I need to think about the steps involved:\n\n1. **Reading the input file:** I need to read the file line by line. Each line contains space-separated integers.\n\n2. **Parsing the integers:** For each line, I need to split the line into individual strings based on spaces, then convert those strings to integers.\n\n3. **Calculating the sum:** Add up the integers in each line.\n\n4. **Writing the sums to an output file:** Take the sum of each line and write it to a new file, each sum on a new line.\n\nAlright, let's start by setting up the basic structure of the class.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.BufferedWriter;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class SumCalculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Code will go here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI've imported the necessary classes for reading from and writing to files. Now, I need to handle the file reading and writing.\n\nFirst, I need to handle command-line arguments because I need to know the input and output file paths. Let's assume that the user will provide the input file path and the output file path as command-line arguments.\n\nSo, in the `main` method, I'll check if two arguments are provided:\n\n```java\nif (args.length != 2) {\n    System.out.println(\"Usage: java SumCalculator <input_file> <output_file>\");\n    System.exit(1);\n}\nString inputFilePath = args[0];\nString outputFilePath = args[1];\n```\n\nNext, I need to read from the input file line by line. I'll use a `BufferedReader` for this purpose.\n\n```java\ntry (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inputFilePath))) {\n    // Read lines and process\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    System.out.println(\"Error reading input file: \" + e.getMessage());\n    System.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\nInside the try block, I'll read each line using a loop:\n\n```java\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    // Process each line\n}\n```\n\nFor each line, I need to split it into individual integers. I'll use the `split` method with space as the delimiter.\n\n```java\nString[] numbersStr = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n```\n\nThen, I need to convert these strings to integers and calculate their sum.\n\n```java\nint sum = 0;\nfor (String numStr : numbersStr) {\n    int num = Integer.parseInt(numStr);\n    sum += num;\n}\n```\n\nAfter calculating the sum, I need to write it to the output file. For this, I'll use a `BufferedWriter`.\n\nI should open the `BufferedWriter` outside the reading loop to ensure it's properly managed.\n\n```java\ntry (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))) {\n    // Write sums to the output file\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    System.out.println(\"Error writing to output file: \" + e.getMessage());\n    System.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to integrate the reading and writing parts. It might be better to collect all sums in a list first and then write them all at once, but to keep it simple, I'll write each sum immediately after calculating it.\n\nSo, the overall structure would be:\n\n- Open the input file for reading.\n\n- Open the output file for writing.\n\n- Read each line from the input file.\n\n- For each line, split the line into strings, convert them to integers, and calculate the sum.\n\n- Write the sum to the output file.\n\n- Close both files.\n\nTo make it efficient, I'll use try-with-resources to handle the closing of files automatically.\n\nHere's how it might look:\n\n```java\ntry (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inputFilePath));\n     BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))) {\n\n    String line;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        String[] numbersStr = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        int sum = 0;\n        for (String numStr : numbersStr) {\n            int num = Integer.parseInt(numStr);\n            sum += num;\n        }\n        writer.write(sum + \"\\n\");\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    System.out.println(\"Error processing files: \" + e.getMessage());\n    System.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. However, I should consider edge cases and potential errors.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n1. **Empty lines:** If a line is empty, splitting it will result in an empty array. The sum should be 0.\n\n2. **Lines with only one number:** This should still work as it's just a single integer.\n\n3. **Lines with non-integer values:** If a line contains something that's not an integer, `Integer.parseInt()` will throw a `NumberFormatException`. I need to handle this gracefully.\n\n4. **Empty input file:** If the input file is empty, there should be no output written.\n\n5. **Output file already exists:** I need to decide whether to overwrite it or append to it. For now, I'll overwrite it.\n\nTo handle potential `NumberFormatException`, I can add a try-catch block inside the loop.\n\n```java\ntry {\n    int num = Integer.parseInt(numStr);\n    sum += num;\n} catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n    System.out.println(\"Skipping invalid number: \" + numStr);\n}\n```\n\nThis way, if there's an invalid number, it will be skipped, and the sum will be calculated only from valid integers.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to provide more detailed error messages or handle errors in a specific way, but for simplicity, skipping invalid numbers and printing a message should suffice.\n\nAnother thing to consider is performance. If the input file is very large, reading line by line should still be efficient. However, if there are lines with a huge number of integers, converting and summing them might take some time, but there's not much I can do about that without complicating the program.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the program can handle negative numbers, as the task didn't specify that the integers are positive.\n\nLet me think about the user experience. The program expects two command-line arguments: input file path and output file path. If the user provides fewer or more arguments, the program should inform them about the correct usage.\n\nI should also consider adding some comments to the code for clarity, especially since this is a simple program but it's good practice.\n\nFinally, I should test the program with different scenarios to ensure it works as expected.\n\n**Testing:**\n\n1. **Valid input file with multiple lines of integers:**\n\n   - Input:\n\n     ```\n     1 2 3\n\n     4 5 6\n\n     7 8 9\n\n     ```\n\n   - Expected output:\n\n     ```\n     6\n\n     15\n\n     24\n\n     ```\n\n2. **Input file with empty lines:**\n\n   - Input:\n\n     ```\n     10 20 30\n\n     \n\n     40 50\n\n     ```\n\n   - Expected output:\n\n     ```\n     60\n\n     0\n\n     90\n\n     ```\n\n3. **Input file with non-integer values:**\n\n   - Input:\n\n     ```\n     1 a 3\n\n     b 5 c\n\n     ```\n\n   - Expected output:\n\n     ```\n     4 (since 'a' and 'c' are skipped)\n\n     5 (only '5' is valid)\n\n     ```\n\n4. **Empty input file:**\n\n   - Input:\n\n     ```\n\n     ```\n\n   - Expected output:\n\n     ```\n\n     ```\n\n5. **Input file with single integers per line:**\n\n   - Input:\n\n     ```\n     10\n\n     20\n\n     30\n\n     ```\n\n   - Expected output:\n\n     ```\n     10\n\n     20\n\n     30\n\n     ```\n\nI should also check if the input file doesn't exist or if there are permission issues when reading or writing files. I can handle these exceptions and provide appropriate messages.\n\nOverall, this seems manageable. Now, I'll proceed to write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Java program that reads a text file containing lines of space-separated integers, calculates the sum of each line, and writes the results to a new output file, one result per line.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading the input file:** We use `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line.\n2. **Parsing the integers:** For each line, we split the line into individual strings based on spaces and convert those strings to integers.\n3. **Calculating the sum:** We sum up the integers in each line.\n4. **Writing the sums to an output file:** We use `BufferedWriter` to write the sum of each line to a new file, with each sum on a new line.\n5. **Handling exceptions:** We handle cases where the file cannot be read or written, and skip any non-integer values in the input file.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.BufferedWriter;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class SumCalculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length != 2) {\n            System.out.println(\"Usage: java SumCalculator <input_file> <output_file>\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n        String inputFilePath = args[0];\n        String outputFilePath = args[1];\n\n        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inputFilePath));\n             BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))) {\n\n            String line;\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                String[] numbersStr = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n                int sum = 0;\n                for (String numStr : numbersStr) {\n                    try {\n                        int num = Integer.parseInt(numStr);\n                        sum += num;\n                    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n                        System.out.println(\"Skipping invalid number: \" + numStr);\n                    }\n                }\n                writer.write(sum + \"\\n\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error processing files: \" + e.getMessage());\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Command-Line Arguments:** The program expects two command-line arguments: the input file path and the output file path.\n2. **Reading from the Input File:** We use `BufferedReader` to read the input file line by line.\n3. **Parsing and Summing:** For each line, we split the line into strings using spaces as delimiters, convert them to integers, and calculate their sum. Non-integer values are skipped with a warning message.\n4. **Writing to the Output File:** We use `BufferedWriter` to write each sum to the output file, ensuring each sum is on a new line.\n5. **Exception Handling:** We handle `IOException` for file operations and `NumberFormatException` for invalid integer conversions, ensuring the program remains robust against common errors."
