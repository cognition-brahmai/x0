        "content": "Let's dive into this question about drug metabolism. So, the ADME process\u2014absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion\u2014is fundamental in understanding how drugs move through the body and are ultimately eliminated. Each stage plays a crucial role, but the question is asking which one is primarily responsible for detoxification and removal of active substances.\n\nFirst, absorption is the initial step where the drug gets into the bloodstream from the site where it\u2019s administered, like\u53e3\u670d,\u6ce8\u5c04, etc. This is important because it determines how much of the drug reaches the circulation and how quickly. But absorption itself isn\u2019t directly involved in detoxification; it\u2019s more about getting the drug into the body.\n\nNext, distribution is about how the drug spreads throughout the body once it\u2019s in the bloodstream. It\u2019s influenced by factors like blood flow to different organs, plasma protein binding, and the drug\u2019s ability to cross cell membranes. While distribution helps in delivering the drug to its site of action, it\u2019s not primarily about detoxification either.\n\nMetabolism, often happening in the liver, is where the drug is transformed, usually into metabolites that are more water-soluble and easier to excrete. This is a key step in detoxification because it can inactivate the drug or convert it into less active forms. Some drugs are even activated during metabolism, meaning their therapeutic effect is only realized after metabolic conversion. So, metabolism plays a central role in both activating and deactivating drugs, making it crucial for detoxification.\n\nExcretion, primarily through the kidneys, is the final step where the drug and its metabolites are removed from the body. The kidneys filter the blood and excrete waste products, including drugs and their metabolites, in the urine. Other routes of excretion include the gastrointestinal tract via feces, exhalation through the lungs, and sweat. Excretion is essential for removing the drug from the body, preventing buildup and potential toxicity.\n\nNow, the question specifies \u201cdetoxification and removal of active substances.\u201d Detoxification typically involves rendering the drug less active or inactive, which aligns closely with the metabolism phase. Metabolism breaks down the drug into metabolites that are often less active or inactive, reducing their potential to cause effects in the body, including toxic effects.\n\nExcretion is about removing these substances from the body, whether they are the original drug or its metabolites. So, while excretion is crucial for removing the substances, it\u2019s the metabolism that primarily handles the detoxification part by altering the drug\u2019s chemical structure.\n\nConsidering this, the stage primarily responsible for detoxification is metabolism, while excretion handles the removal of both the original drug and its metabolites.\n\nBut let\u2019s look back at the options:\n\nA. Absorption\n\nB. Distribution\n\nC. Metabolism\n\nD. Excretion\n\nE. Both A and C\n\nGiven the explanations above, metabolism (C) seems to be the primary stage responsible for detoxification, whereas excretion (D) is more about removal. However, the question mentions \u201cboth detoxification and removal,\u201d so perhaps it\u2019s considering both metabolism and excretion as crucial steps in this process.\n\nBut since it\u2019s asking for the stage primarily responsible for detoxification and removal, and considering that detoxification is more closely associated with metabolism, while excretion is about removal, the most accurate answer would be C. Metabolism.\n\nHowever, option E says \u201cboth A and C,\u201d which includes absorption and metabolism. Absorption is the process of getting the drug into the bloodstream, which isn\u2019t directly related to detoxification. Therefore, E doesn\u2019t seem correct.\n\nTo confirm, let\u2019s think about it this way: detoxification involves making the drug less harmful or inactive, typically through chemical modifications, which is what metabolism does. Excretion removes the substances from the body, preventing their accumulation and potential toxicity, but it\u2019s not directly detoxifying them; it\u2019s removing them after they\u2019ve been detoxified (often through metabolism).\n\nTherefore, the stage primarily responsible for detoxification is metabolism, with excretion handling the removal of both the original drug and its metabolites.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. Metabolism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n"
