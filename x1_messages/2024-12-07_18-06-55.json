        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to prove that the diagonal of a rectangle with sides of lengths a and b has a length of sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). And I'm supposed to use the Pythagorean theorem to do that. Okay, let's start by recalling what the Pythagorean theorem is all about.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. So, if we have a right triangle with sides of lengths x and y, and hypotenuse z, then z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nNow, a rectangle has four right angles, which means that each corner is a 90-degree angle. If I draw a diagonal in the rectangle, it will split the rectangle into two right-angled triangles. Each of these triangles will have sides of lengths a and b, and the diagonal will be the hypotenuse of these triangles.\n\nSo, if I consider one of these right-angled triangles, the sides a and b are the legs, and the diagonal is the hypotenuse. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse (which is the diagonal in this case) should be sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nWait a minute, that seems almost too straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing here? Maybe I should visualize this or draw a sketch to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\nLet me imagine a rectangle. Let's say the bottom side is of length a, and the height is b. If I draw a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner, it should divide the rectangle into two congruent right-angled triangles.\n\nIn one of these triangles, the base is a, the height is b, and the hypotenuse is the diagonal we're trying to find. So, applying the Pythagorean theorem:\n\ndiagonal\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nTherefore, diagonal = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But maybe I should consider the properties of a rectangle to ensure that this applies universally to all rectangles.\n\nRectangles have opposite sides that are equal in length, and all angles are right angles. So, regardless of the lengths of a and b, as long as it's a rectangle, drawing a diagonal should always create two right-angled triangles where the diagonal is the hypotenuse.\n\nLet me consider a specific example to test this. Suppose a = 3 and b = 4. Then, according to the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal should be sqrt(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nI know from geometry that in a 3-4-5 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 3:4:5, and it's a right-angled triangle. So, in this case, the diagonal is indeed 5 units long.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the coordinates of the rectangle. Let's place the rectangle on a coordinate plane with one corner at the origin (0,0). Then, the coordinates of the four vertices would be:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (a,0)\n\n- (a,b)\n\n- (0,b)\n\nNow, the diagonal would be from (0,0) to (a,b). To find the length of this diagonal, I can use the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The distance d between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is given by:\n\nd = sqrt( (x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2 )\n\nSo, plugging in the coordinates:\n\nd = sqrt( (a - 0)\u00b2 + (b - 0)\u00b2 ) = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nThis matches what I got earlier using the Pythagorean theorem directly.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using vectors or some other mathematical concept?\n\nWell, using vectors, the sides of the rectangle can be represented as vectors of magnitudes a and b, perpendicular to each other. The diagonal would be the resultant vector of these two vectors.\n\nThe magnitude of the resultant vector is given by sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2ab*cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the vectors. Since the vectors are perpendicular, \u03b8 = 90 degrees, and cos(90\u00b0) = 0. Therefore, the magnitude simplifies to sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), which again matches our previous result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep arriving at the same conclusion: the length of the diagonal is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nLet me consider if there are any special cases or exceptions. For example, if a = b, meaning the rectangle is actually a square, then the diagonal would be sqrt(a\u00b2 + a\u00b2) = sqrt(2a\u00b2) = a*sqrt(2), which is consistent with what we know about squares.\n\nAnother special case could be when one of the sides is zero. If a = 0, then the rectangle collapses into a line of length b, and the diagonal would simply be b, which matches sqrt(0\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(b\u00b2) = b. Similarly, if b = 0, the diagonal would be a.\n\nThis makes sense because if one side is zero, the \"rectangle\" is no longer a rectangle but a line segment, and the diagonal is just the length of that segment.\n\nI should also consider if a and b are negative. But in the context of lengths, a and b are typically positive real numbers. However, mathematically, if we consider negative values, the square of a negative number is positive, so sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) would still give a positive length, which makes sense because lengths are always positive.\n\nWait a second, in the coordinate plane, coordinates can be negative, but when calculating distances, we square the differences, so the signs don't affect the final result.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I've used the Pythagorean theorem directly, applied the distance formula, and even considered vectors, all leading to the same conclusion. I've also checked specific examples and special cases to verify the result.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the length of the diagonal of a rectangle with sides a and b is indeed sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), as proven by the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\]"
