        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a telecom company wanting to expand its network coverage in rural areas. They currently have 500 towers covering 60% of the targeted area, and they want to reach 95% coverage. I need to figure out how many new towers they need to build and estimate the annual cost if each tower costs $200,000 to construct and maintain.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of towers and the coverage area. It seems like there's a direct proportion here: more towers mean more coverage. But I need to be careful because sometimes adding more towers might not increase coverage linearly, especially if there's overlap in coverage areas. However, since the problem doesn't specify any complexities, I'll assume that the coverage increases linearly with the number of towers.\n\nSo, if 500 towers cover 60%, I can set up a proportion to find out how many towers are needed for 95% coverage.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( n \\) = total number of towers needed for 95% coverage.\n\nThen, the proportion would be:\n\n\\( \\frac{500 \\text{ towers}}{60\\%} = \\frac{n \\text{ towers}}{95\\%} \\)\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\( n = \\frac{500 \\times 95\\%}{60\\%} \\)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, convert percentages to decimals:\n\n60% = 0.6\n\n95% = 0.95\n\nSo,\n\n\\( n = \\frac{500 \\times 0.95}{0.6} \\)\n\n\\( n = \\frac{475}{0.6} \\)\n\n\\( n = 791.666... \\)\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a tower, I'll need to round up to the next whole number, which is 792 towers.\n\nNow, they already have 500 towers, so the number of new towers required is:\n\n792 - 500 = 292 towers.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the annual cost for these new towers. Each tower costs $200,000 to construct and maintain annually.\n\nSo, the total annual cost would be:\n\n292 towers \u00d7 $200,000/tower = $58,400,000.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check my assumptions.\n\nFirst, I assumed that coverage increases linearly with the number of towers. But in reality, coverage might not increase linearly because of overlapping areas or diminishing returns with each additional tower. However, since the problem doesn't provide any details about non-linear effects, I think it's acceptable to assume linearity for this calculation.\n\nSecond, the cost of $200,000 per tower seems to include both construction and maintenance. The problem says \"construct and maintain annually,\" which might imply that this is a one-time cost for construction plus annual maintenance. But the way it's worded, it seems like $200,000 is the total annual cost per tower, including both construction and maintenance. However, normally, construction would be a one-time cost, and maintenance would be an annual cost. But perhaps in this context, they've combined them for simplicity.\n\nTo clarify, I'll consider $200,000 as the annual cost per tower, which includes both construction and maintenance.\n\nSo, with 292 new towers, the total annual cost would indeed be $58,400,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if construction costs are one-time and maintenance is annual.\n\nIf construction is $x per tower and maintenance is $y per tower per year, and their sum is $200,000, then:\n\nTotal annual cost would be:\n\n(Construction cost for new towers) + (Annual maintenance for all towers)\n\nBut the problem says \"construct and maintain annually,\" which seems to imply that $200,000 is the annual cost that includes both.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if construction is a one-time cost and maintenance is annual, then:\n\n- Construction cost for 292 towers: 292 \u00d7 $x\n\n- Annual maintenance for all towers: (500 + 292) \u00d7 $y\n\nBut since the problem combines them into a single figure of $200,000 per tower annually, I'll stick with the initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the company needs to build 292 new towers, and the annual cost for these new towers would be $58,400,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{292 \\text{ towers, } \\$58,400,000 \\text{ annually}} \\]"
