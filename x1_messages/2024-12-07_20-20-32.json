This provided me with general information about the monument, including its construction date and the name of its designer. According to LandmarkFacts, the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 and was designed by Gustave Eiffel. To ensure the accuracy of this information, I also consulted Wikipedia with the same input, which confirmed the details provided by LandmarkFacts. Therefore, the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 by Gustave Eiffel."
