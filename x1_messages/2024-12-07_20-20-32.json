        "content": "So, there's a class of 30 students, and we know that 16 have brown eyes and 7 have blue eyes. The rest have green eyes, and we need to find out what fraction of the class has green eyes. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students have green eyes. Since the total number of students is 30, and 16 have brown eyes and 7 have blue eyes, I can subtract the number of students with brown and blue eyes from the total to find the number with green eyes.\n\nSo, number of students with green eyes = total students - (brown-eyed students + blue-eyed students).\n\nThat would be 30 - (16 + 7). Let's do the math inside the parentheses first: 16 + 7 equals 23.\n\nThen, 30 - 23 equals 7. So, 7 students have green eyes.\n\nNow, to find the fraction of the class that has green eyes, I need to put the number of green-eyed students over the total number of students.\n\nSo, fraction = green-eyed students / total students = 7 / 30.\n\nWait a minute, is this the simplest form? Let's check if 7 and 30 have any common factors other than 1.\n\n7 is a prime number, and 30 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5. Nothing in common there, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the class that has green eyes is 7/30.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nBrown eyes: 16\n\nBlue eyes: 7\n\nGreen eyes: 30 - (16 + 7) = 30 - 23 = 7\n\nFraction: 7/30\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{30}} \\]"
