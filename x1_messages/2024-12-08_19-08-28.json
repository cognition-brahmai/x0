Here's how you can structure the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, GPA\nFROM Students\nORDER BY GPA DESC, last_name ASC, first_name ASC;\n```\n\nIn this query:\n\n- `SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, GPA` specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the \"Students\" table.\n\n- `FROM Students` indicates the table from which to retrieve the data.\n\n- `ORDER BY GPA DESC, last_name ASC, first_name ASC` sorts the records first by GPA in descending order (highest GPA first), then by last name in ascending order (alphabetical order), and finally by first name in ascending order.\n\nThis will give you a list of students sorted primarily by their GPA, with ties broken first by last name and then by first name."
