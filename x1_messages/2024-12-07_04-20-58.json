        "content": "In Greek mythology, the god of wine, fertility, ritual madness, and religious ecstasy is Dionysus. He is one of the twelve Olympian gods and is known for his dual nature: he represents not only mirth, pleasure, and celebration but also chaos and disorder. Dionysus is often depicted wearing a crown of vines and leaves, carrying a thyrsus (a staff topped with a pinecone), and accompanied by satyrs and maenads, who are his female followers known for their wild, ecstatic rites. His Roman counterpart is Bacchus."
