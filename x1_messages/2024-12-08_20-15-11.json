        "content": "So I've got this election problem here. There are two candidates, A and B, and candidate A received 55% of the votes, while B got the rest. The total number of votes cast was 8000. I need to find out by how many votes candidate A won.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find the difference in the number of votes between candidate A and candidate B. That makes sense.\n\nSo, candidate A has 55% of the votes, and candidate B has the remaining percentage. Since there are only two candidates, the percentages should add up to 100%. Therefore, candidate B must have 45% of the votes, because 100% - 55% = 45%.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the actual number of votes each candidate received. The total number of votes is 8000.\n\nTo find the number of votes for candidate A, I can calculate 55% of 8000. Similarly, for candidate B, it's 45% of 8000. Then, I'll subtract the number of votes for B from the number of votes for A to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating 55% of 8000.\n\n55% of 8000 is (55/100) * 8000.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n55 divided by 100 is 0.55.\n\nThen, 0.55 multiplied by 8000 is:\n\n0.55 * 8000 = 4400.\n\nSo, candidate A received 4400 votes.\n\nNow, for candidate B, it's 45% of 8000.\n\n45% of 8000 is (45/100) * 8000.\n\n45 divided by 100 is 0.45.\n\n0.45 multiplied by 8000 is:\n\n0.45 * 8000 = 3600.\n\nSo, candidate B received 3600 votes.\n\nNow, to find out by how many votes candidate A won, I need to subtract the number of votes for B from the number of votes for A.\n\nThat is: 4400 - 3600 = 800.\n\nSo, candidate A won by 800 votes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe a simpler way?\n\nLet me think.\n\nSince candidate A has 55% and candidate B has 45%, the difference in their percentages is 55% - 45% = 10%.\n\nSo, the difference in votes is 10% of the total votes.\n\n10% of 8000 is (10/100) * 8000 = 0.1 * 8000 = 800.\n\nSo, again, the difference is 800 votes.\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have directly calculated 10% of 8000 without finding the individual votes for A and B. That would have been quicker.\n\nBut since I'm detailed-oriented, I like to see it both ways to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, in conclusion, candidate A won by 800 votes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
