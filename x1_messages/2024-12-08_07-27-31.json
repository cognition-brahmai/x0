        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a book with 300 pages, and I read 20 pages every day except on weekends, which are Saturday and Sunday. I need to find out how many days it will take to finish the book.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how many days I actually read each week. Since I don't read on weekends, that means I read from Monday to Friday. So, that's 5 days a week I'm reading 20 pages each day.\n\nLet me calculate how many pages I read in one week:\n\nPages per week = pages per day * number of reading days per week\n\nPages per week = 20 pages/day * 5 days/week = 100 pages/week\n\nNow, I have 300 pages to read in total. So, if I read 100 pages each week, I can find out how many weeks it will take by dividing the total pages by pages per week:\n\nWeeks needed = total pages / pages per week\n\nWeeks needed = 300 pages / 100 pages/week = 3 weeks\n\nBut wait, this gives me the number of weeks, but the question is about days. Since each week has 5 reading days, I can calculate the total reading days:\n\nTotal reading days = weeks needed * reading days per week\n\nTotal reading days = 3 weeks * 5 days/week = 15 days\n\nSo, it seems like it will take me 15 days to finish the book.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's consider that I read 20 pages every Monday to Friday, and nothing on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSo, each week, I read 100 pages, as calculated before. After 3 weeks, I would have read:\n\n3 weeks * 100 pages/week = 300 pages\n\nWhich matches the total number of pages in the book. So, 3 weeks or 15 reading days seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of days without considering weeks. I read 20 pages per day on reading days, and I need to read 300 pages in total.\n\nTotal reading days needed = total pages / pages per day\n\nTotal reading days needed = 300 pages / 20 pages/day = 15 days\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility that the last week might have fewer reading days if the total pages don't perfectly fit into the weekly reading schedule.\n\nIn this case, since 300 pages divided by 100 pages per week is exactly 3 weeks, there are no extra pages left over. So, the calculation holds.\n\nBut let's imagine a scenario where the total pages aren't a perfect multiple of weekly pages. For example, if the book had 310 pages, then:\n\nWeeks needed = 310 pages / 100 pages/week = 3.1 weeks\n\nSince I can't have a fraction of a week, I would need to round up to 4 weeks. But in this case, it's exactly 3 weeks, so no need to worry about partial weeks.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total reading days without regarding weeks. Since I read 20 pages per day on reading days, and I need to read 300 pages, the total reading days required are indeed 15 days, as calculated.\n\nBut since my reading pattern is 5 days a week, with 2 days off, I need to make sure that these 15 reading days don't span into more weeks than anticipated.\n\nLet's see: 15 reading days, with 5 reading days per week, means exactly 3 weeks.\n\nSo, in terms of calendar days, considering weekends, let's see how many actual days pass.\n\nEach week has 7 days, so 3 weeks would be 3 * 7 = 21 days.\n\nOut of these 21 days, I read on 15 days (Monday to Friday for 3 weeks), and have 6 days off (2 weekends with 2 days each, so 4 days, plus possibly some days if the book finishes before the end of the third week, but in this case, it finishes exactly on the last reading day of the third week).\n\nWait, let's clarify: 3 weeks have 3 weekends, which are 6 days (Saturdays and Sundays). So, total days in 3 weeks: 21 days.\n\nReading days: 15 days (Monday to Friday for 3 weeks).\n\nSo, the book is finished on the last reading day of the third week.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken is 21 calendar days.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"how long will it take you to finish the book?\" and it doesn't specify whether to count only reading days or total calendar days.\n\nGiven that, I might need to clarify what is being asked.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"How long will it take you to finish the book? Show your work.\"\n\nI think \"how long\" in this context likely refers to the total time elapsed, including non-reading days, because it's about the duration from starting to finish.\n\nSo, considering that, it would be 21 days, accounting for the weekends in between.\n\nHowever, in my earlier calculation, I considered only reading days to find the number of weeks and then converted to total days. But perhaps there's a different way to approach it.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that I read 20 pages every Monday to Friday and rest on weekends.\n\nSo, in week 1:\n\nMonday: 20 pages\n\nTuesday: 20 pages\n\nWednesday: 20 pages\n\nThursday: 20 pages\n\nFriday: 20 pages\n\nTotal for week 1: 100 pages\n\nWeekend: no reading\n\nWeek 2:\n\nMonday: 20 pages (120 pages total)\n\nTuesday: 20 pages (140 pages total)\n\nWednesday: 20 pages (160 pages total)\n\nThursday: 20 pages (180 pages total)\n\nFriday: 20 pages (200 pages total)\n\nWeekend: no reading\n\nWeek 3:\n\nMonday: 20 pages (220 pages total)\n\nTuesday: 20 pages (240 pages total)\n\nWednesday: 20 pages (260 pages total)\n\nThursday: 20 pages (280 pages total)\n\nFriday: 20 pages (300 pages total)\n\nSo, on the Friday of the third week, I reach 300 pages.\n\nTherefore, it takes 3 weeks, which is 21 days, to finish the book.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that after 15 reading days, the book is finished, and each week has 5 reading days, then 15 reading days correspond to 3 weeks, which is again 21 days.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of reading days, not total days.\n\nTo confirm, let's see:\n\nTotal reading days: 15\n\nTotal weekends: 3 weekends = 6 days\n\nTotal days: 15 + 6 = 21 days\n\nAlternatively, total weeks: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days\n\nSo, the total time taken is 21 days.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should consider if the starting day affects the total days.\n\nFor example, if I start on a Monday, then after 3 weeks, finishing on a Friday, it would be exactly 21 days.\n\nBut if I start on a different day, say a Wednesday, it might alter the total days.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because regardless of the starting day, since I'm reading Monday to Friday each week, and taking weekends off, the reading schedule repeats every week.\n\nTherefore, for 15 reading days, spread over 3 weeks, it will always be 21 calendar days, assuming I start on a Monday.\n\nBut to generalize, if I start on any day, the total time might vary slightly.\n\nWait, let's think about this.\n\nSuppose I start reading on a Wednesday.\n\nDay 1: Wednesday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 2: Thursday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 3: Friday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 4: Saturday, no reading\n\nDay 5: Sunday, no reading\n\nDay 6: Monday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 7: Tuesday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 8: Wednesday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 9: Thursday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 10: Friday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 11: Saturday, no reading\n\nDay 12: Sunday, no reading\n\nDay 13: Monday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 14: Tuesday, read 20 pages\n\nDay 15: Wednesday, read 20 pages\n\nTotal pages read: 15 * 20 = 300 pages\n\nTotal calendar days: 15 reading days + 4 non-reading days (2 weekends with 2 days each) = 19 days\n\nWait, this is different from the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, if I start on a Wednesday, it takes 19 calendar days to finish the book, whereas starting on a Monday takes 21 calendar days.\n\nThis suggests that the total time depends on the starting day of the week.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\nStarting on Wednesday:\n\n- Week 1: Wed, Thu, Fri (3 reading days)\n\n- Week 2: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri (5 reading days)\n\n- Week 3: Mon, Tue, Wed (3 reading days)\n\nTotal reading days: 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 reading days\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it would take 15 reading days. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. The book has 300 pages, and I read 20 pages per reading day.\n\nTotal reading days needed: 300 / 20 = 15 reading days\n\nSo, in the scenario where I start on Wednesday, it shouldn't take only 11 reading days.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nStarting on Wednesday:\n\nWeek 1: Wed (day 1), Thu (day 2), Fri (day 3)\n\nWeek 2: Mon (day 4), Tue (day 5), Wed (day 6), Thu (day 7), Fri (day 7)\n\nWeek 3: Mon (day 8), Tue (day 9), Wed (day 10), Thu (day 11), Fri (day 12)\n\nWeek 4: Mon (day 13), Tue (day 14), Wed (day 15)\n\nSo, it spans over 4 weeks, with reading days distributed as above.\n\nTotal calendar days: \n\n- Week 1: 3 reading days + 2 weekend days = 5 days\n\n- Week 2: 5 reading days + 2 weekend days = 7 days\n\n- Week 3: 5 reading days + 2 weekend days = 7 days\n\n- Week 4: 3 reading days (assuming I finish on the third day of the fourth week)\n\nTotal calendar days: 5 + 7 + 7 + 3 = 22 days\n\nWait, this is more than the earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach of calculating weeks based on complete weeks of reading.\n\nGiven that, and considering that 15 reading days correspond to exactly 3 weeks of reading (5 reading days per week), the total time is 3 weeks or 21 calendar days.\n\nIf I start on a Monday, it's straightforward: 3 weeks, finishing on the Friday of the third week.\n\nIf I start on a different day, the total time may vary, but on average, it should still be around 21 days.\n\nTherefore, for simplicity, and since the starting day isn't specified, it's reasonable to assume that it takes 3 weeks or 21 days to finish the book.\n\nSo, the final answer is 21 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
