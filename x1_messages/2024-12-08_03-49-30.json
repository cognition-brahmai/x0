        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 people, and each person has a cat. So, that's 4 people and 4 cats, plus there's a dog in the room. So, total animals are 4 people, 4 cats, and 1 dog.\n\nNow, people have 2 legs each, cats have 4 legs each, and dogs have 4 legs each.\n\nSo, for the people: 4 people \u00d7 2 legs = 8 legs.\n\nFor the cats: 4 cats \u00d7 4 legs = 16 legs.\n\nFor the dog: 1 dog \u00d7 4 legs = 4 legs.\n\nNow, adding them all up: 8 (people's legs) + 16 (cats' legs) + 4 (dog's legs) = 28 legs in total.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard some versions of this riddle where the answer is different because someone might be holding a cat, or something like that. But in this straightforward scenario, it should be 28 legs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dog has fewer legs, like if it's a three-legged dog, but the question says \"a dog,\" so I think it's safe to assume it has 4 legs.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the people are standing or sitting. But legs are legs, whether they're standing or sitting, they still have the same number of legs.\n\nSo, my final answer is 28 legs in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
