It's not just about acquiring knowledge; it's about understanding the depth and complexity of various subjects. For instance, take quantum physics. You can watch all the documentaries you want, but until you dive into the actual textbooks, you won't grasp the true intricacies of the double-slit experiment or Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. Books provide a level of detail and rigor that other mediums often lack. Plus, there's something inherently satisfying about holding a physical book, feeling the weight of all that accumulated wisdom in your hands. It's almost like a tangible connection to the great minds of the past. So, yeah, I'd say reading books is pretty darn important."
