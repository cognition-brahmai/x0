        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a Java program that reads a CSV file containing names and email addresses, and then validates those email addresses using regular expressions. For each invalid email address, it will print out the corresponding name and email with an error message.\n\nFirst, make sure you have a CSV file ready. Let's assume the CSV file is named \"contacts.csv\" and it has two columns: name and email, separated by commas, with each entry on a new line. For example:\n\n```\nJohn Doe,john.doe@example.com\nJane Smith,jane.smith@example.com\nInvalid User,invalid-email\n```\n\nNow, let's break down the steps we need to follow:\n\n1. **Reading the CSV file:** We need to read the file line by line and split each line into name and email using the comma as a delimiter.\n\n2. **Validating email addresses:** We'll use a regular expression to check if the email addresses are valid.\n\n3. **Handling invalid emails:** If an email doesn't match the regular expression, we'll print an error message including the name and the invalid email.\n\nLet's start by setting up the basic structure of the Java program.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Java program that reads a CSV file containing names and email addresses, validates the email addresses using regular expressions, and prints an error message for any invalid email addresses found.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading the CSV file:** We will read the file line by line and split each line into name and email using a comma as the delimiter.\n2. **Validating email addresses:** We will use a regular expression to check if the email addresses are valid.\n3. **Handling invalid emails:** For any email that does not match the regular expression, we will print an error message including the name and the invalid email.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class EmailValidator {\n\n    // Regular expression for validating an email\n    private static final String EMAIL_REGEX = \"^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+$\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String csvFile = \"contacts.csv\";\n        BufferedReader br = null;\n        String line;\n        String delimiter = \",\";\n\n        // Try-with-resources to ensure resources are closed\n        try {\n            br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(csvFile));\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                // Use comma as separator\n                String[] data = line.split(delimiter);\n                if (data.length == 2) {\n                    String name = data[0];\n                    String email = data[1];\n                    if (!isValidEmail(email)) {\n                        System.out.println(\"Error: Invalid email for \" + name + \": \" + email);\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Warning: Skipping invalid line format: \" + line);\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            if (br != null) {\n                try {\n                    br.close();\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to validate email using regular expression\n    private static boolean isValidEmail(String email) {\n        return email != null && email.matches(EMAIL_REGEX);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the CSV file:** We use a `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line. Each line is split into name and email using the comma delimiter.\n2. **Validating email addresses:** We define a regular expression that matches valid email addresses and use the `matches` method to check if the email conforms to this pattern.\n3. **Handling invalid emails:** If the email does not match the regular expression, we print an error message that includes the name and the invalid email.\n\nThis approach ensures that all email addresses in the CSV file are checked for validity, and any invalid entries are reported with relevant information."
