        "content": "So if the factory makes 200 widgets every hour, and we need to make 15,000 of them, how do we figure out how many hours it will take?\n\nWell, I think we can start by seeing how many hours are needed to reach 15,000 widgets. Since the factory produces 200 widgets each hour, we can divide the total number of widgets needed by the number of widgets produced per hour.\n\nSo, that would be 15,000 divided by 200. Let me do that calculation.\n\n15,000 divided by 200 is... let's see, 200 times 75 is 15,000. So, it should take 75 hours to produce 15,000 widgets.\n\nBut wait, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the factory makes 200 widgets per hour, then in 75 hours, it would make 200 times 75, which is indeed 15,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be 75 hours.\n\nBut maybe there are other factors to consider, like downtime, maintenance, or breaks. Does the problem mention anything about that? Not that I can see. It just says the factory produces 200 widgets per hour, so I think we can assume it's a constant rate without any interruptions.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula:\n\nTime = Total quantity / Rate\n\nIn this case, the total quantity is 15,000 widgets, and the rate is 200 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, Time = 15,000 / 200 = 75 hours.\n\nYeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to think about it in terms of units, we have widgets per hour, and we need to find hours, so dividing the total widgets by the rate per hour gives us the time in hours.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, it seems like 75 hours is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think there's any need for further calculation or consideration here. The problem is pretty straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
