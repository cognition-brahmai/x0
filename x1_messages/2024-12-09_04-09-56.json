        "content": "Certainly! Here are four healthy snack options that are high in protein and low in sugar, along with their nutritional benefits:\n\n1. **Greek Yogurt**\n   - **Nutritional Benefits:** Greek yogurt is an excellent source of protein, containing about 20 grams per 8-ounce serving. It's lower in sugar compared to regular yogurt, especially if you choose plain, unsweetened varieties. It also provides calcium, probiotics for gut health, and vitamins B12 and B2.\n\n2. **Hard-Boiled Eggs**\n   - **Nutritional Benefits:** Hard-boiled eggs are a convenient and protein-packed snack. One large egg offers around 6 grams of protein and is low in sugar. Eggs are also rich in vitamins D and B12, as well as minerals like selenium and choline, which are essential for brain function and metabolism.\n\n3. **Nuts (Almonds, Walnuts, etc.)**\n   - **Nutritional Benefits:** Nuts such as almonds and walnuts are high in protein and healthy fats, making them a satisfying snack. For instance, a quarter cup of almonds provides about 7 grams of protein and is low in sugar. They also contain fiber, vitamin E, and magnesium, which support heart health and digestion.\n\n4. **Edamame**\n   - **Nutritional Benefits:** Edamame, or young soybeans, are a fantastic plant-based protein source. A half-cup serving can provide around 11 grams of protein and is naturally low in sugar. Edamame also offers fiber, iron, and various vitamins and minerals, making it a nutritious choice for vegetarians and vegans.\n\nThese snacks not only help in meeting your protein needs but also provide a range of other nutrients essential for overall health."
