        "content": "That's a question about literature, specifically regarding a 19th-century author and a series of novels featuring the character Natty Bumppo, known as the Leatherstocking Tales. I need to recall who the author is and confirm the details about the character and the series.\n\nI think the author is James Fenimore Cooper. He was a prominent American writer in the 19th century, and I believe he wrote a series of novels featuring Natty Bumppo, who is a frontiersman. The series is indeed called the Leatherstocking Tales, and it consists of five novels.\n\nLet me list the novels in the series to confirm:\n\n1. The Pioneers (1823)\n\n2. The Last of the Mohicans (1826)\n\n3. The Prairie (1827)\n\n4. The Pathfinder (1840)\n\n5. The Deerslayer (1841)\n\nSo, Natty Bumppo appears in these five novels, each set in different periods and locations in the American frontier. He is a skilled woodsman and hunter, known for his relationship with the Native American characters in the stories.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper is well-regarded for his depiction of the frontier and the interactions between settlers and Native Americans. The Leatherstocking Tales are considered his most famous works and have had a significant influence on American literature and culture.\n\nTo summarize, the 19th-century author who created Natty Bumppo and the Leatherstocking Tales is James Fenimore Cooper.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{James Fenimore Cooper}} \\]"
