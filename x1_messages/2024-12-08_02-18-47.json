        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The company has a monthly revenue of $50,000. It spends $30,000 on fixed costs and 25% of its revenue on variable costs. We need to find out the monthly profit.\n\nFirst, let's understand what profit is. Profit is basically what's left after you subtract all your costs from your revenue. So, profit = revenue - total costs.\n\nNow, the total costs consist of fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are those that don't change with the level of output, like rent or salaries. Variable costs change with the level of output, like raw materials.\n\nIn this case, the fixed costs are given as $30,000 per month. The variable costs are 25% of the revenue. Since the revenue is $50,000, the variable costs would be 25% of $50,000.\n\nLet me calculate that. 25% of $50,000 is (25/100)*50,000 = $12,500.\n\nSo, the total costs are fixed costs plus variable costs, which is $30,000 + $12,500 = $42,500.\n\nNow, profit is revenue minus total costs, which is $50,000 - $42,500 = $7,500.\n\nTherefore, the company's monthly profit is $7,500.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nRevenue: $50,000\n\nFixed costs: $30,000\n\nVariable costs: 25% of $50,000 = $12,500\n\nTotal costs: $30,000 + $12,500 = $42,500\n\nProfit: $50,000 - $42,500 = $7,500\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: if variable costs are 25% of revenue, then the remaining percentage of revenue is the contribution to profit after covering fixed costs.\n\nLet's see: 100% - 25% = 75%. So, 75% of revenue is available to cover fixed costs and profit.\n\nSo, 75% of $50,000 is (75/100)*50,000 = $37,500.\n\nNow, after covering fixed costs of $30,000, the remaining amount is profit: $37,500 - $30,000 = $7,500.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the contribution margin, which is revenue minus variable costs, and then subtract fixed costs to get profit.\n\nContribution margin = revenue - variable costs = $50,000 - $12,500 = $37,500.\n\nThen, profit = contribution margin - fixed costs = $37,500 - $30,000 = $7,500.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think $7,500 is the correct monthly profit for the company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7500} \\]"
