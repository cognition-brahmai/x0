        "content": "So there are 100 birds sitting on a fence, and a hunter shoots and kills 20 of them. The question is, how many birds are left on the fence?\n\nAt first glance, it seems like a straightforward subtraction problem: 100 minus 20 equals 80. So, 80 birds should be left on the fence. But let's think about it a bit more carefully.\n\nWhen a hunter shoots at the birds, especially if he's shooting multiple birds, it's likely that the sound of the gunshots would scare the other birds away. So, even if only 20 birds are killed, the remaining birds might fly off out of fear.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that there are no birds left on the fence after the shooting, because the others have flown away.\n\nBut maybe not all the birds fly away. Perhaps some are too scared to move, or maybe some are curious and stay put. It's hard to say for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hunter only shot at specific birds and missed some, but the question says he killed 20, so we can assume that 20 birds were killed.\n\nSo, considering that the noise might scare the birds away, the most plausible answer is that there are no birds left on the fence.\n\nBut if we strictly interpret the problem mathematically, without considering the behavior of the birds, then 100 minus 20 equals 80.\n\nHowever, since this is likely a trick question testing logical thinking, the expected answer might be zero, assuming that the noise would scare all the remaining birds away.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe some birds are dead on the fence, and some have flown away. So, there could be 20 dead birds still on the fence, and the other 80 have flown off.\n\nIn that case, there are 20 birds left on the fence, but they are all dead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hunter only shot from a distance, and only 20 birds were killed, but the rest were scared and flew away, leaving only the dead ones on the fence.\n\nSo, in this scenario, there would be 20 dead birds on the fence.\n\nBut perhaps some of the birds that were not shot might have been injured and still be on the fence.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify whether any birds were injured without being killed.\n\nAssuming that only 20 birds were killed and the rest either flew away or were unaffected, the most likely scenario is that only the dead birds remain on the fence.\n\nTherefore, there are 20 birds left on the fence, all of which are dead.\n\nBut if we consider that some birds might still be alive and remain on the fence despite the commotion, then the number could be higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the birds that weren't killed flew away, leaving only the 20 dead ones.\n\nSo, in that case, there would be 20 birds left on the fence.\n\nBut to be precise, the question asks for the number of birds left on the fence, not the number of dead birds.\n\nSo, if some alive birds stayed on the fence despite the shooting, they should also be counted.\n\nHowever, it's unlikely that any alive birds would stay on the fence after such a traumatic event.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to assume that only the dead birds remain on the fence.\n\nHence, there are 20 birds left on the fence.\n\nBut perhaps the question is trying to trick us into thinking about the behavior of the birds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fence is in a location where birds are used to noise and wouldn't fly away easily.\n\nBut without that information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the information provided, the safest answer is that there are 20 birds left on the fence.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there are no birds left on the fence.\n\nIf the hunter shoots and kills 20 birds, those 20 are dead on the fence, and the remaining 80 fly away out of fear.\n\nSo, in that case, there would be 20 dead birds on the fence, but no live birds remaining on the fence.\n\nTherefore, the number of birds left on the fence is zero, assuming that \"left on the fence\" refers to alive birds.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify whether the birds are alive or dead.\n\nIt just says \"birds left on the fence.\"\n\nSo, including both alive and dead birds, there would be 20 birds left on the fence.\n\nBut if we consider only alive birds, then there are zero left on the fence.\n\nGiven that the question is probably trying to be tricky, perhaps the answer is zero, assuming that all alive birds flew away, and only the dead ones remain on the fence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all 100 birds were sitting on the fence, and the hunter killed 20, leaving 80 alive but scared to fly away.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hunter shot and killed 20 birds, and the remaining 80 flew away out of fear.\n\nSo, again, only the 20 dead birds are left on the fence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the alive birds were so scared that they fell off the fence and onto the ground, but the question specifies birds \"on the fence.\"\n\nSo, perhaps only the dead birds remain on the fence, and any alive birds that were not killed have flown away.\n\nTherefore, the number of birds left on the fence is 20.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps the fence is in a location where birds don't fly away easily, or perhaps the fence is so long that not all birds are scared to fly away.\n\nBut without that information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the answer is zero, assuming that all alive birds flew away, and only the dead ones remain on the fence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the alive birds were too shocked to move and remained on the fence.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's difficult to determine.\n\nSo, considering the most likely scenario, where the noise scares away all alive birds, leaving only the dead ones on the fence, the answer should be 20 birds left on the fence.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose that after the hunter shoots and kills 20 birds, the remaining 80 birds are scared and fly away immediately.\n\nTherefore, only the 20 dead birds remain on the fence.\n\nHence, there are 20 birds left on the fence.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that some of the alive birds might stay on the fence despite the noise, then the number could be higher than 20.\n\nBut, as mentioned earlier, this seems unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is 20 birds left on the fence.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps the question is testing our assumption about the behavior of the birds.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the answer is zero, assuming that all alive birds flew away, and only the dead ones remain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hunter's shots were so accurate that only 20 birds were killed, and the others didn't notice or weren't scared away.\n\nBut that also seems unlikely.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the best answer is 20 birds left on the fence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
