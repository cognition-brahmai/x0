        "content": "I'm going to create a simple chat server in Java using sockets that can handle multiple clients. The server should be able to accept connections from multiple clients, broadcast messages from one client to all others, and manage client disconnections properly.\n\nFirst, I need to set up the server socket that will listen for incoming client connections. Then, for each client that connects, I'll need to handle their communication in a separate thread to manage multiple clients concurrently.\n\nHere's a basic outline of what I need to do:\n\n1. Create a ServerSocket to listen for incoming connections.\n2. Accept connections from clients and create a new thread for each client.\n3. In each client thread, read messages from the client and broadcast them to all other connected clients.\n4. Handle client disconnections by removing them from the list of connected clients.\n\nI should also think about how to manage the list of connected clients. I need a collection that can be accessed by multiple threads safely, so I might use a ConcurrentList or synchronize access to a regular list.\n\nLet me start by setting up the server class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a basic chat server in Java using sockets that can handle multiple clients, broadcast messages, and manage disconnections gracefully, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup**: Use a `ServerSocket` to listen for incoming client connections.\n2. **Multi-threading**: For each client that connects, create a new thread to handle their communication, allowing the server to manage multiple clients concurrently.\n3. **Broadcasting Messages**: Read messages from one client and send them to all other connected clients.\n4. **Graceful Disconnection**: Handle client disconnections by removing them from the list of connected clients.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ChatServer {\n    private static final List<ClientHandler> clients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);\n        System.out.println(\"Chat Server started on port 1234\");\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n            ClientHandler client = new ClientHandler(clientSocket);\n            clients.add(client);\n            new Thread(client).start();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void broadcastMessage(String message, ClientHandler excludeClient) {\n        for (ClientHandler client : clients) {\n            if (client != excludeClient) {\n                client.sendMessage(message);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n        private Socket socket;\n        private BufferedReader in;\n        private PrintWriter out;\n\n        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n            this.socket = socket;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            try {\n                in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n                out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n                String message;\n                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Received: \" + message);\n                    broadcastMessage(message, this);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } finally {\n                try {\n                    socket.close();\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n                clients.remove(this);\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void sendMessage(String message) {\n            out.println(message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server Setup**:\n   - A `ServerSocket` is created to listen on port 1234.\n   - The server accepts incoming client connections in a loop.\n\n2. **Multi-threading**:\n   - For each client connection, a new `ClientHandler` thread is created.\n   - `ClientHandler` reads messages from the client and broadcasts them to other clients.\n\n3. **Broadcasting Messages**:\n   - The `broadcastMessage` method sends a message to all clients except the sender.\n   - Messages are read from the client's input stream and written to the output streams of other clients.\n\n4. **Graceful Disconnection**:\n   - When a client disconnects, their thread exits, and they are removed from the list of connected clients.\n   - Resources are cleaned up by closing the socket.\n\nThis setup ensures that the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously, broadcast messages effectively, and manage client disconnections gracefully."
