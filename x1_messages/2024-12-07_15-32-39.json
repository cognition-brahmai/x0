        "content": "So the company sells products with a 20% profit margin, and they sell one item for $120. I need to find out what their cost was to produce that item.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a profit margin is. Profit margin is the percentage of profit based on the selling price. So, if the profit margin is 20%, that means that 20% of the selling price is profit.\n\nLet me denote the cost to produce the item as C. The selling price is $120, and the profit is 20% of the selling price.\n\nSo, profit = 20% of $120 = 0.20 * 120 = $24.\n\nSince selling price = cost + profit, then $120 = C + $24.\n\nTherefore, C = $120 - $24 = $96.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that profit margin can sometimes be defined based on the cost, not the selling price. Maybe I should consider that.\n\nIf the profit margin is based on cost, then profit = 20% of C.\n\nSo, selling price = C + 0.20*C = 1.20*C.\n\nGiven that selling price is $120, then 1.20*C = $120.\n\nTherefore, C = $120 / 1.20 = $100.\n\nNow I have two different answers: $96 and $100. That doesn't make sense. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion is about how profit margin is defined. Let me look it up.\n\nOkay, I found that there are different ways to express profit margin. Gross profit margin is often expressed as (selling price - cost) / selling price. That would be the profit as a percentage of the selling price.\n\nAlternatively, it can be expressed as (selling price - cost) / cost, which is the profit as a percentage of the cost.\n\nIn the first approach I took, I used profit margin as (profit / selling price) = 20%, which led me to C = $96.\n\nIn the second approach, I used profit margin as (profit / cost) = 20%, leading to C = $100.\n\nSo, which one is correct in this context?\n\nThe problem says \"20% profit margin.\" It doesn't specify whether it's based on selling price or cost. This is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider that in business, profit margin is often expressed as a percentage of the selling price. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the standard way companies calculate profit margins.\n\nLet me consider that profit margin is expressed as profit divided by revenue (which is selling price). So, profit margin = (selling price - cost) / selling price.\n\nGiven that, then 20% = (120 - C)/120.\n\nThen, 0.20 = (120 - C)/120.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 120: 24 = 120 - C.\n\nTherefore, C = 120 - 24 = $96.\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is expressed as profit over cost, then profit margin = (selling price - cost)/cost.\n\nSo, 20% = (120 - C)/C.\n\nThen, 0.20 = (120 - C)/C.\n\nMultiplying both sides by C: 0.20*C = 120 - C.\n\nAdding C to both sides: 1.20*C = 120.\n\nDividing both sides by 1.20: C = 120 / 1.20 = $100.\n\nSo, depending on how profit margin is defined, I get two different costs: $96 and $100.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for a standard definition.\n\nUpon checking, I see that there are different types of profit margins:\n\n1. Gross profit margin: can be expressed as (revenue - cost of goods sold)/revenue.\n\n2. Operating profit margin: (operating income)/revenue.\n\n3. Net profit margin: (net income)/revenue.\n\nBut in this context, it's likely referring to gross profit margin.\n\nAssuming it's gross profit margin based on revenue, then (120 - C)/120 = 20%.\n\nSo, C = 120 - (0.20 * 120) = 120 - 24 = $96.\n\nAlternatively, if it's based on cost, then C = 120 / 1.20 = $100.\n\nI think the key is to find out which definition is being used in this problem.\n\nMaybe I should consider that a 20% profit margin based on cost would mean that profit is 20% of cost, so selling price is cost plus 20% of cost, which is what I did second.\n\nAlternatively, a 20% profit margin based on selling price would mean that profit is 20% of selling price, which is the first approach.\n\nGiven that, I have two possible answers.\n\nPerhaps the problem is expecting the second approach, where cost is $100.\n\nBut I need to confirm which interpretation is correct.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nThe company sells products at a 20% profit margin. If they sell an item for $120, what was their cost to produce it?\n\nIf profit margin is based on selling price, then cost is $96.\n\nIf based on cost, then cost is $100.\n\nMaybe I can set up equations to solve for both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: profit margin based on selling price.\n\nProfit = selling price - cost.\n\nProfit margin = profit / selling price = 20%.\n\nSo, (120 - C)/120 = 0.20.\n\nSolving for C: C = 120 - (0.20 * 120) = 120 - 24 = $96.\n\nSecond scenario: profit margin based on cost.\n\nProfit = selling price - cost.\n\nProfit margin = profit / cost = 20%.\n\nSo, (120 - C)/C = 0.20.\n\nSolving for C: 120 - C = 0.20*C.\n\n120 = 1.20*C.\n\nC = 120 / 1.20 = $100.\n\nSo, both methods are mathematically correct, depending on the definition used.\n\nPerhaps the standard definition in business is profit margin based on selling price, which would make the cost $96.\n\nAlternatively, it could be based on cost, making the cost $100.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is $100.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider another approach.\n\nLet me consider the formula for selling price when cost and profit margin are known.\n\nIf profit margin is based on cost, then selling price = cost * (1 + profit margin).\n\nSo, 120 = C * 1.20.\n\nTherefore, C = 120 / 1.20 = $100.\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is based on selling price, then selling price = cost / (1 - profit margin).\n\nSo, 120 = C / (1 - 0.20) = C / 0.80.\n\nTherefore, C = 120 * 0.80 = $96.\n\nWait a minute, now I'm getting the same answers again.\n\nI think the confusion arises from the definition of profit margin.\n\nIn business, profit margin is often expressed as profit divided by selling price.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct interpretation is C = 120 - (0.20 * 120) = $96.\n\nBut I've seen in some textbooks that profit margin is based on cost.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the problem is using profit margin based on cost, which would give C = $100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on selling price, leading to C = $96.\n\nI think the best approach is to consider both possibilities and see which one makes more sense.\n\nIf the cost is $96 and they sell it for $120, then the profit is $24.\n\nProfit margin based on selling price is 24/120 = 20%, which matches the given information.\n\nIf the cost is $100 and they sell it for $120, then the profit is $20.\n\nProfit margin based on cost is 20/100 = 20%, which also matches.\n\nBut wait, in the second case, profit margin based on cost is 20%, but the problem says \"profit margin\" without specifying.\n\nPerhaps in this context, it refers to profit margin based on cost, making the cost $100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on selling price, making the cost $96.\n\nI need to make a decision based on standard business practices.\n\nI think that profit margin is more commonly expressed as a percentage of selling price.\n\nTherefore, the cost should be $96.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps I should consider that the problem is expecting the answer to be $100.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard formula I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider\u8d21\u732e\u8fb9\u9645\u7387, which is similar to profit margin.\n\nBut I'm still unsure.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to use the formula for cost based on selling price and profit margin.\n\nIf profit margin is based on selling price, then cost = selling price * (1 - profit margin).\n\nSo, C = 120 * (1 - 0.20) = 120 * 0.80 = $96.\n\nIf profit margin is based on cost, then cost = selling price / (1 + profit margin).\n\nSo, C = 120 / (1 + 0.20) = 120 / 1.20 = $100.\n\nGiven that, I have two possible answers.\n\nI think the correct interpretation is based on selling price, making the cost $96.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider that the problem is referring to gross profit margin, which is (selling price - cost)/selling price.\n\nIn that case, (120 - C)/120 = 0.20, leading to C = $96.\n\nAlternatively, if it's operating profit margin or net profit margin, it could be different.\n\nBut in the context of producing an item, it's likely gross profit margin.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with C = $96.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me consider that if the cost is $96 and they sell it for $120, the profit is $24.\n\nThen, profit margin based on selling price is 24/120 = 20%, which matches.\n\nIf the cost were $100, and they sell it for $120, profit is $20.\n\nThen, profit margin based on selling price is 20/120 = 16.67%, which doesn't match the 20% given.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that profit margin based on cost is (profit/cost) = 20/100 = 20%, which matches.\n\nBut the problem says \"20% profit margin,\" and it doesn't specify based on what.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that in retail, profit margin is often based on selling price.\n\nIn that case, C = $96.\n\nAlternatively, in manufacturing, it might be based on cost.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the definition provided in the problem.\n\nThe company sells products at a 20% profit margin.\n\nIf they sell an item for $120, what was their cost to produce it?\n\nI think the key is to assume that the profit margin is based on the selling price.\n\nTherefore, cost = selling price - (profit margin * selling price) = 120 - (0.20 * 120) = $96.\n\nAlternatively, if it's based on cost, then cost = selling price / (1 + profit margin) = 120 / 1.20 = $100.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is $96.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, perhaps I should consider the following:\n\nIf the cost is $96 and they sell it for $120, profit is $24.\n\nThen, profit margin based on selling price is 24/120 = 20%.\n\nIf the cost is $100 and they sell it for $120, profit is $20.\n\nThen, profit margin based on selling price is 20/120 = 16.67%.\n\nBut the problem says \"20% profit margin,\" which seems to match the first scenario where cost is $96.\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is based on cost, then with C = $100, profit is $20, and profit margin is 20/100 = 20%, which also matches.\n\nSo both interpretations seem valid, but they lead to different costs.\n\nThis is problematic.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that in economics and accounting, profit margin is typically expressed as profit divided by selling price.\n\nIn that case, C = $96.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some contexts, it's expressed as profit divided by cost.\n\nI need to find a way to resolve this ambiguity.\n\nMaybe I can set up an equation where profit margin is defined as (selling price - cost)/selling price = 20%.\n\nThen, (120 - C)/120 = 0.20.\n\nSolving for C: 120 - C = 24 => C = 96.\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is (selling price - cost)/cost = 20%.\n\nThen, (120 - C)/C = 0.20.\n\nSolving for C: 120 - C = 0.20*C => 120 = 1.20*C => C = 100.\n\nSo, depending on the definition, C is either $96 or $100.\n\nI think the problem is expecting the first interpretation, where C = $96.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider that in business, profit margin is often expressed based on selling price.\n\nTherefore, C = $96.\n\nAlternatively, if it's based on cost, C = $100.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is $96.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, perhaps I should consider the following:\n\nIf the cost is $96 and they sell it for $120, the markup is $24, which is 20% of the selling price.\n\nAlternatively, if the cost is $100 and they sell it for $120, the markup is $20, which is 20% of the cost.\n\nBut the problem says \"20% profit margin,\" which seems to refer to the markup being 20% of the selling price, making C = $96.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is $96.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
