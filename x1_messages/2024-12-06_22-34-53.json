On the other hand, \"organic\" refers to foods that are produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms.\n\nWhile some organic foods may also be non-GMO, not all non-GMO foods are organic. It's possible for a food to be non-GMO but still contain synthetic pesticides or other non-organic ingredients.\n\nSo, in summary, \"non-GMO\" and \"organic\" are separate labels that indicate different aspects of food production."
