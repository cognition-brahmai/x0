        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Implementing a bubble sort algorithm in Python is straightforward. Bubble sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how bubble sort works:\n\n1. **Start** from the first element and compare it with the next element.\n2. **If** the first element is greater than the next element, **swap** them.\n3. **Move** to the next pair and repeat step 2.\n4. **Continue** this process until the end of the list.\n5. **Repeat** the entire process for each element in the list.\n\nThe largest elements gradually \"bubble\" to the end of the list, hence the name \"bubble sort.\"\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement the bubble sort algorithm in Python, we need to iterate through the list multiple times, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Outer Loop**: This loop runs from the first element to the second last element. It controls the number of passes.\n2. **Inner Loop**: This loop runs from the first element to the last unsorted element. It performs the comparisons and swaps.\n\nThe algorithm stops early if no swaps are made in a pass, indicating that the list is already sorted.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Track if a swap happens\n        swapped = False\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        # If no two elements were swapped by inner loop, then break\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(n)`)**: This loop ensures that we make up to `n` passes over the list, where `n` is the number of elements in the list.\n2. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(0, n-i-1)`)**: On each pass, this loop compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The `n-i-1` ensures that we don't re-check elements that have already been placed in their correct position in previous passes.\n3. **Swap Tracking (`swapped`)**: This boolean variable is used to optimize the algorithm. If no swaps are made in a complete pass, it means the list is already sorted, and we can terminate early.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the list is sorted in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm."
