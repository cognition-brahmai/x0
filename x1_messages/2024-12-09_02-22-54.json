        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company starts with $10,000 and invests it in a project that has an annual interest rate of 8%, and this interest is compounded quarterly. I need to find out how much the investment will be worth after 2 years.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest. The general formula is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years.\n\nOkay, so in this case:\n\nP = $10,000\n\nr = 8% per year, which is 0.08 as a decimal.\n\nn = 4, because the interest is compounded quarterly (4 times a year).\n\nt = 2 years.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.08/4)^(4*2)\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n0.08 / 4 = 0.02\n\nSo, each quarter, the interest rate is 2%.\n\nNow, add 1 to this quarter rate:\n\n1 + 0.02 = 1.02\n\nNext, raise this to the power of the total number of quarters in 2 years:\n\n4 quarters/year * 2 years = 8 quarters.\n\nSo, A = 10000 * (1.02)^8\n\nNow, I need to calculate (1.02)^8.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 1.02 squared:\n\n1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404\n\nThen, 1.0404 squared:\n\n1.0404 * 1.0404 = 1.08166416\n\nNow, multiply that by 1.02 two more times since 8 is 2^3, but maybe it's easier to keep multiplying by 1.02.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the exponentiation directly.\n\nLet me try calculating 1.02 to the 8th power.\n\n1.02^1 = 1.02\n\n1.02^2 = 1.0404\n\n1.02^3 = 1.0404 * 1.02 = 1.061208\n\n1.02^4 = 1.061208 * 1.02 \u2248 1.08243216\n\n1.02^5 \u2248 1.08243216 * 1.02 \u2248 1.1040808032\n\n1.02^6 \u2248 1.1040808032 * 1.02 \u2248 1.126162419264\n\n1.02^7 \u2248 1.126162419264 * 1.02 \u2248 1.14968566764928\n\n1.02^8 \u2248 1.14968566764928 * 1.02 \u2248 1.1726793809992656\n\nSo, (1.02)^8 \u2248 1.1726793809992656\n\nNow, multiply this by the principal amount:\n\nA \u2248 10000 * 1.1726793809992656 \u2248 11726.793809992656\n\nRounding to two decimal places, since we're dealing with money:\n\nA \u2248 $11,726.79\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the compound interest formula directly.\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.08/4)^(4*2)\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.02)^(8)\n\nA = 10000(1.02)^8\n\nNow, calculating (1.02)^8 again:\n\n1.02^1 = 1.02\n\n1.02^2 = 1.0404\n\n1.02^3 = 1.0404 * 1.02 = 1.061208\n\n1.02^4 = 1.061208 * 1.02 \u2248 1.08243216\n\n1.02^5 \u2248 1.08243216 * 1.02 \u2248 1.1040808032\n\n1.02^6 \u2248 1.1040808032 * 1.02 \u2248 1.126162419264\n\n1.02^7 \u2248 1.126162419264 * 1.02 \u2248 1.14968566764928\n\n1.02^8 \u2248 1.14968566764928 * 1.02 \u2248 1.1726793809992656\n\nMultiplying by 10,000:\n\nA \u2248 10000 * 1.1726793809992656 \u2248 11726.793809992656\n\nAgain, rounding to two decimal places: $11,726.79\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more precise way to calculate this using financial formulas or functions in a calculator or spreadsheet. But based on the compound interest formula, this seems correct.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe using the effective annual rate.\n\nThe effective annual rate (EAR) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEAR = (1 + r/n)^n - 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nEAR = (1 + 0.08/4)^4 - 1\n\nEAR = (1 + 0.02)^4 - 1\n\nEAR = (1.02)^4 - 1\n\nCalculating (1.02)^4:\n\n1.02^1 = 1.02\n\n1.02^2 = 1.0404\n\n1.02^3 = 1.061208\n\n1.02^4 = 1.08243216\n\nSo, EAR = 1.08243216 - 1 = 0.08243216 or 8.243216%\n\nNow, the investment is for 2 years, so the total amount would be:\n\nA = P(1 + EAR)^t\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.08243216)^2\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + EAR):\n\n1 + 0.08243216 = 1.08243216\n\nThen, raise to the power of 2:\n\n(1.08243216)^2 \u2248 1.172679381\n\nNow, multiply by P:\n\nA \u2248 10000 * 1.172679381 \u2248 11726.79381\n\nAgain, rounding to two decimal places: $11,726.79\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, so I'm confident this is the correct amount.\n\nAlternatively, if the interest were compounded annually, the calculation would be different, but in this case, it's compounded quarterly, so the quarterly compounding affects the overall amount.\n\nTherefore, after 2 years, the investment will be worth approximately $11,726.79.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11726.79} \\]"
