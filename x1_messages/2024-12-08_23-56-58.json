It assists in locating a list of websites that might provide the answer to the user's question.\nPageLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links, where input is one or more links, and delivers plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and gives a plain text, newline-separated list of links.\nAIQA[input]: Artificial Intelligence-based Question Answering model, especially adept at answering questions based on an input text passage. The input must be a text question referencing a :datum[n]: variable, like How many species of birds exist, given :datum1:?\n\nEach function input should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to merge a string with an evidence variable, e.g., AIQA[What is the lifespan of a tortoise, given :datum2:?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should conform to this format:\nPlan: [initial action based on input question]\n:datum0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action based on the result of :datum0:]\n:datum1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may refer to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :datum0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:datum[n]: containing the ultimate answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are the health benefits of regular exercise and what types of exercises are recommended for beginners?"

I have these tools to help me: Ecosia for searching the web, PageLoader for getting text from websites, LinkExtractor for finding links in text, and AIQA for answering questions based on text.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up some information about the health benefits of exercise. I can use Ecosia for that. So, I'll search \"health benefits of regular exercise\" and see what comes up.\n\nPlan: Use Ecosia to search for health benefits of regular exercise.\n\n:datum0: = Ecosia[health benefits of regular exercise]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to pick some reliable sources from the list of websites Ecosia provides. Maybe look for sites like Mayo Clinic, WebMD, or other health-related organizations. Then, I can use PageLoader to extract the text from those pages.\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from :datum0: and load their content.\n\n:datum1: = LinkExtractor[:datum0:]\n\n:datum2: = PageLoader[:datum1:]\n\nNow, with the text from those pages, I can use AIQA to summarize the health benefits of regular exercise.\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to summarize health benefits from :datum2:.\n\n:datum3: = AIQA[What are the health benefits of regular exercise, given :datum2:?]\n\nNext, I need to find out about exercises recommended for beginners. I can probably do another Ecosia search for \"exercises for beginners\" and follow a similar process.\n\nPlan: Search for exercises recommended for beginners.\n\n:datum4: = Ecosia[exercises for beginners]\n\nThen, extract relevant links and load the page content.\n\nPlan: Extract links from :datum4: and load their content.\n\n:datum5: = LinkExtractor[:datum4:]\n\n:datum6: = PageLoader[:datum5:]\n\nFinally, use AIQA to identify and list exercises suitable for beginners from :datum6:.\n\nPlan: Summarize exercises for beginners from :datum6:.\n\n:datum7: = AIQA[What types of exercises are recommended for beginners, given :datum6:?]\n\nPutting it all together, I should have :datum3: with the health benefits and :datum7: with the exercise recommendations for beginners.
