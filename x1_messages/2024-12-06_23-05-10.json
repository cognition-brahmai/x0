        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, there are 10 houses in the village. Each house is supposed to have 5 rooms, and each room has 2 windows. That sounds straightforward, but there's a catch: one of the houses is under construction and only has half of its windows installed. Okay, so I need to account for that.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total number of windows if all houses were complete. Then, I'll adjust for the construction house.\n\nSo, for a complete house:\n\nNumber of rooms per house = 5\n\nNumber of windows per room = 2\n\nTherefore, windows per complete house = 5 rooms/house * 2 windows/room = 10 windows/house\n\nNow, there are 10 houses, but one is under construction. So, 9 houses are complete.\n\nWindows in complete houses = 9 houses * 10 windows/house = 90 windows\n\nNow, for the under construction house: it only has half of its windows installed.\n\nWindows in construction house = 10 windows * 0.5 = 5 windows\n\nTherefore, total windows in the village = windows in complete houses + windows in construction house = 90 + 5 = 95 windows\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\nTotal windows if all houses were complete: 10 houses * 10 windows/house = 100 windows\n\nBut one house has only half its windows installed, so it's missing 5 windows (since it should have 10, but has only 5).\n\nTherefore, total windows = 100 - 5 = 95 windows\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it: the construction house has only half its windows, which means it has 5 windows instead of 10.\n\nSo, total windows = (9 houses * 10 windows) + (1 house * 5 windows) = 90 + 5 = 95 windows\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the number of rooms in the construction house.\n\nIt has 5 rooms, each supposed to have 2 windows, so 10 windows in total.\n\nBut only half are installed, so 5 windows.\n\nTherefore, total windows in the village: (9 houses * 10 windows) + (1 house * 5 windows) = 90 + 5 = 95 windows\n\nYes, that seems consistent across different approaches.\n\nSo, the final answer is 95 windows in the village.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{95} \\]"
