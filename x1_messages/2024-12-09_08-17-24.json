        "content": "I'd be happy to help you classify these cheeses based on their country of origin. Here's the list you provided: Cheddar, Brie, Gouda, Feta, Mozzarella, Roquefort, Manchego, Swiss, Camembert, Parmesan.\n\nLet's start by identifying the country each cheese originates from:\n\n1. **Cheddar**: This cheese is named after the village of Cheddar in Somerset, England, where it was traditionally made. So, Cheddar is from the United Kingdom.\n\n2. **Brie**: Brie is a soft cheese that originates from the \u00cele-de-France region in France, specifically around the towns of Meaux and Melun. Therefore, Brie is French.\n\n3. **Gouda**: Gouda is a Dutch cheese named after the city of Gouda in the Netherlands. It's one of the most widely exported cheeses from the Netherlands.\n\n4. **Feta**: Feta is a brined curd white cheese traditionally made in Greece from sheep's milk, or a mixture of sheep and goat's milk.\n\n5. **Mozzarella**: Mozzarella originates from Italy, particularly southern Italy and the area around Naples. It's a fresh, string cheese classically made from water buffalo milk, although nowadays it's also made from cow's milk.\n\n6. **Roquefort**: Roquefort is a blue cheese from the south of France, specifically from the Roquefort-sur-Soulzon area in the Aveyron department. It's made from sheep's milk.\n\n7. **Manchego**: Manchego is a firm, sheep's milk cheese from La Mancha, a region in central Spain.\n\n8. **Swiss**: Swiss cheese, often referred to as Emmental or Emmentaler, originates from the Emme River valley in Switzerland. It's known for its large holes and nutty flavor.\n\n9. **Camembert**: Camembert is another French cheese, similar to Brie but typically richer and stronger in flavor. It originates from the Normandy region of France.\n\n10. **Parmesan**: Parmesan, more formally known as Parmigiano-Reggiano, is an Italian hard, granular cheese aged for at least 12 months. It's named after the producing areas of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, and Bologna.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- United Kingdom: Cheddar\n\n- France: Brie, Roquefort, Camembert\n\n- Netherlands: Gouda\n\n- Greece: Feta\n\n- Italy: Mozzarella, Parmesan\n\n- Spain: Manchego\n\n- Switzerland: Swiss (Emmental)\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask."
