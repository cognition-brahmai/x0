        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that connects to a MongoDB database, creates a new collection named \"users\", and inserts 10 sample user documents with random names, ages, and email addresses. I'm going to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I have MongoDB installed and running on my machine. I assume that's already set up. Next, I need to install the Python driver for MongoDB, which is called `pymongo`. I can install it using pip if it's not already installed.\n\nSo, step one: Install pymongo.\n\nI can do this by running:\n\n```bash\npip install pymongo\n```\n\nOnce that's installed, I can start writing the Python script.\n\nI need to import the necessary modules from pymongo to connect to the database.\n\n```python\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n```\n\nNow, I need to connect to the MongoDB server. Typically, MongoDB runs on localhost at port 27017. So, I'll use that.\n\n```python\nclient = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n```\n\nAfter connecting, I need to create a database. Let's call it \"mydatabase\" for this example.\n\n```python\ndb = client['mydatabase']\n```\n\nNow, I need to create a new collection called \"users\". In MongoDB, collections are created when the first document is inserted into them, so I don't need to explicitly create the collection beforehand.\n\nNext, I need to generate 10 sample user documents with random names, ages, and email addresses. To generate random data, I can use the `random` module in Python, along with maybe the `faker` library, which is great for generating fake data.\n\nI need to install `faker` if it's not already installed:\n\n```bash\npip install faker\n```\n\nThen, I can import it in my script:\n\n```python\nfrom faker import Faker\n```\n\nI'll initialize the Faker provider:\n\n```python\nfake = Faker()\n```\n\nNow, I can use Faker to generate random names and email addresses. For ages, I can generate random integers within a certain range, say between 18 and 80.\n\nSo, I'll create a list to hold the user documents:\n\n```python\nusers = []\n```\n\nThen, I'll loop 10 times to create 10 user documents:\n\n```python\nfor _ in range(10):\n    user = {\n        'name': fake.name(),\n        'age': fake.random_int(min=18, max=80),\n        'email': fake.email()\n    }\n    users.append(user)\n```\n\nNow, I have a list of 10 user documents. I need to insert them into the \"users\" collection.\n\nTo insert multiple documents at once, I can use the `insert_many` method:\n\n```python\nresult = db.users.insert_many(users)\n```\n\nFinally, I can print out the IDs of the inserted documents to verify that they were inserted successfully:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Inserted IDs:\", result.inserted_ids)\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete script would look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\nfrom faker import Faker\n\n# Connect to MongoDB\nclient = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\ndb = client['mydatabase']\n\n# Initialize Faker\nfake = Faker()\n\n# Create sample users\nusers = []\nfor _ in range(10):\n    user = {\n        'name': fake.name(),\n        'age': fake.random_int(min=18, max=80),\n        'email': fake.email()\n    }\n    users.append(user)\n\n# Insert users into the 'users' collection\nresult = db.users.insert_many(users)\n\n# Print inserted IDs\nprint(\"Inserted IDs:\", result.inserted_ids)\n```\n\nI should also consider adding some error handling in case the connection to the database fails or if there are issues inserting the documents.\n\nFor example, I can wrap the connection and insertion code in try-except blocks:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Connect to MongoDB\n    client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n    db = client['mydatabase']\n\n    # Initialize Faker\n    fake = Faker()\n\n    # Create sample users\n    users = []\n    for _ in range(10):\n        user = {\n            'name': fake.name(),\n            'age': fake.random_int(min=18, max=80),\n            'email': fake.email()\n        }\n        users.append(user)\n\n    # Insert users into the 'users' collection\n    result = db.users.insert_many(users)\n\n    # Print inserted IDs\n    print(\"Inserted IDs:\", result.inserted_ids)\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\nfinally:\n    # Close the connection\n    client.close()\n```\n\nThis way, even if something goes wrong, the connection to the database will be closed properly.\n\nAlso, depending on the requirements, I might want to parameterize the database connection string or other configuration settings.\n\nOverall, this should accomplish the task of connecting to a MongoDB database, creating a \"users\" collection, and inserting 10 sample user documents with random data.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo complete this task, we will create a Python script that connects to a MongoDB database, creates a new collection named \"users\", and inserts 10 sample user documents with random names, ages, and email addresses. We will use the `pymongo` driver to interact with MongoDB and the `faker` library to generate fake data.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Install Required Packages**: Ensure `pymongo` and `faker` are installed.\n2. **Connect to MongoDB**: Use `pymongo` to connect to the MongoDB server.\n3. **Create Database and Collection**: Access or create the database and collection in MongoDB.\n4. **Generate Sample Data**: Use `faker` to generate 10 sample user documents with random names, ages, and email addresses.\n5. **Insert Data into Collection**: Insert the generated user documents into the \"users\" collection.\n6. **Error Handling and Resource Management**: Implement try-except blocks for error handling and ensure the database connection is closed properly.\n\n## Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\nfrom faker import Faker\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Connect to MongoDB\n        client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n        db = client['mydatabase']\n        \n        # Initialize Faker\n        fake = Faker()\n        \n        # Create sample users\n        users = []\n        for _ in range(10):\n            user = {\n                'name': fake.name(),\n                'age': fake.random_int(min=18, max=80),\n                'email': fake.email()\n            }\n            users.append(user)\n        \n        # Insert users into the 'users' collection\n        result = db.users.insert_many(users)\n        \n        # Print inserted IDs\n        print(\"Inserted IDs:\", result.inserted_ids)\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n    finally:\n        # Close the connection\n        client.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Installing Packages**: Make sure `pymongo` and `faker` are installed using pip.\n2. **Database Connection**: Connect to the MongoDB server running on localhost at port 27017.\n3. **Data Generation**: Use the `faker` library to generate realistic fake data for names, ages, and email addresses.\n4. **Inserting Data**: Use `insert_many` to efficiently insert multiple documents into the \"users\" collection.\n5. **Error Handling**: Catch and print any exceptions that occur during execution.\n6. **Resource Management**: Ensure the MongoDB connection is closed in the `finally` block to free up resources.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to populate a MongoDB collection with sample user data, which can be useful for testing and development purposes."
