        "content": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, in total, there are 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 balls in the box. I need to find the probability that exactly one of the three balls drawn at random without replacement is red.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the formula for probability without replacement. Since the balls are drawn without replacement, the events are dependent, meaning the outcome of one draw affects the outcome of the others.\n\nThe general formula for probability is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 12. That sounds like a combination problem because the order in which we draw the balls doesn't matter.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 12 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!} \\]\n\nI can calculate that, but maybe I should leave it in terms of combinations for now.\n\nNow, for the numerator, which is the number of favorable outcomes, I need exactly one red ball in the three balls drawn. That means one red and two non-red balls.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to choose one red ball out of four. That's:\n\n\\[ \\binom{4}{1} = 4 \\]\n\nNext, I need to choose two non-red balls out of the remaining eight balls (since there are 12 total balls and 4 are red, so 12 - 4 = 8 non-red balls). The number of ways to choose two non-red balls out of eight is:\n\n\\[ \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28 \\]\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the product of these two combinations:\n\n\\[ \\text{Favorable outcomes} = \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{8}{2} = 4 \\times 28 = 112 \\]\n\nNow, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly one red}) = \\frac{112}{220} \\]\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n\\[ \\frac{112 \\div 4}{220 \\div 4} = \\frac{28}{55} \\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{28}{55}\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for hypergeometric distribution since we're dealing with sampling without replacement. The hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\times \\binom{N - K}{n - k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(N\\) is the total number of items in the population (12 balls),\n\n- \\(K\\) is the number of success states in the population (4 red balls),\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of items drawn (3 balls),\n\n- \\(k\\) is the number of observed successes (1 red ball).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(X = 1) = \\frac{\\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{12 - 4}{3 - 1}}{\\binom{12}{3}} = \\frac{\\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{12}{3}} \\]\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, I'm confident that my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of permutations, but since the order doesn't matter, combinations are the way to go.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe calculate the probability step by step, considering the sequence of draws.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing a red ball first, then two non-red balls.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red first}) = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of drawing a non-red ball second is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Non-red second} | \\text{Red first}) = \\frac{8}{11} \\]\n\nBecause there are now 11 balls left, with 8 non-red.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing another non-red ball third is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Non-red third} | \\text{Red first and non-red second}) = \\frac{7}{10} \\]\n\nSo, the probability of this sequence (red, non-red, non-red) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{11} \\times \\frac{7}{10} \\]\n\nSimilarly, there are two other sequences where exactly one ball is red: non-red, red, non-red; and non-red, non-red, red.\n\nLet's calculate those probabilities as well.\n\nFirst sequence: red, non-red, non-red\n\n\\[ P_1 = \\frac{4}{12} \\times \\frac{8}{11} \\times \\frac{7}{10} \\]\n\nSecond sequence: non-red, red, non-red\n\n\\[ P_2 = \\frac{8}{12} \\times \\frac{4}{11} \\times \\frac{7}{10} \\]\n\nThird sequence: non-red, non-red, red\n\n\\[ P_3 = \\frac{8}{12} \\times \\frac{7}{11} \\times \\frac{4}{10} \\]\n\nNow, since these are mutually exclusive events, the total probability is the sum of these probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly one red}) = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 \\]\n\nLet's calculate each one:\n\n\\[ P_1 = \\frac{4}{12} \\times \\frac{8}{11} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{11} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{1 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 11 \\times 10} = \\frac{56}{330} \\]\n\n\\[ P_2 = \\frac{8}{12} \\times \\frac{4}{11} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{11} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{2 \\times 4 \\times 7}{3 \\times 11 \\times 10} = \\frac{56}{330} \\]\n\n\\[ P_3 = \\frac{8}{12} \\times \\frac{7}{11} \\times \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{7}{11} \\times \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2 \\times 7 \\times 4}{3 \\times 11 \\times 10} = \\frac{56}{330} \\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly one red}) = \\frac{56}{330} + \\frac{56}{330} + \\frac{56}{330} = \\frac{168}{330} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \\frac{168 \\div 12}{330 \\div 12} = \\frac{14}{27.5} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me check the simplification.\n\nActually, 168 and 330 can both be divided by 6:\n\n\\[ \\frac{168 \\div 6}{330 \\div 6} = \\frac{28}{55} \\]\n\nAh, there we go. So, again, I get \\(\\frac{28}{55}\\), which matches my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly one red ball when three balls are drawn at random without replacement is \\(\\frac{28}{55}\\).\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{28}{55}} \\]"
