        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box with red and blue balls, and when you pick two balls at random at once, there's a 50% chance that both are red. We need to find out what fraction of the balls in the box are red.\n\nFirst, let's denote some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say there are R red balls and B blue balls in the box, making a total of T balls, where T = R + B.\n\nNow, the problem states that if you pick two balls at random at once, the probability that both are red is 50%, or 0.5.\n\nTo find the probability that both balls picked are red, we can use combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of R red balls is given by the combination formula C(R, 2), which is R(R-1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls out of T balls is C(T, 2), which is T(T-1)/2.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls picked are red is C(R, 2) divided by C(T, 2), and we know this equals 0.5.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{C(R, 2)}{C(T, 2)} = 0.5 \\]\n\nSubstituting the combination formulas:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\frac{R(R-1)}{2}}{\\frac{T(T-1)}{2}} = 0.5 \\]\n\nThe 2's cancel out numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R(R-1)}{T(T-1)} = 0.5 \\]\n\nNow, since T = R + B, we can substitute T with R + B:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R(R-1)}{(R + B)(R + B - 1)} = 0.5 \\]\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy with both R and B in the equation. Maybe there's a way to express B in terms of R or vice versa.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps we can express B in terms of R. Let's say B = T - R, since T is the total number of balls.\n\nSo, substitute B with T - R:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R(R-1)}{T(T-1)} = 0.5 \\]\n\nBut T is R + B, and B = T - R, which doesn't seem to simplify things much.\n\nMaybe instead of using B, we can express everything in terms of R and T, and solve for R/T, which is the fraction of red balls we're looking for.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R(R-1)}{T(T-1)} = 0.5 \\]\n\nLet's cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction:\n\n\\[ R(R-1) = 0.5 \\times T(T-1) \\]\n\nNow, since T = R + B, and we're trying to find R/T, perhaps we can express R in terms of T.\n\nLet's consider that R/T is the fraction we're looking for. Let's denote this fraction as P, so P = R/T.\n\nThen, R = P*T.\n\nSubstitute R = P*T into the equation:\n\n\\[ P*T*(P*T - 1) = 0.5 * T*(T - 1) \\]\n\nLet's expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: P*T*(P*T - 1) = P^2*T^2 - P*T\n\nRight side: 0.5*T*(T - 1) = 0.5*T^2 - 0.5*T\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ P^2*T^2 - P*T = 0.5*T^2 - 0.5*T \\]\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[ P^2*T^2 - P*T - 0.5*T^2 + 0.5*T = 0 \\]\n\nNow, let's factor out T:\n\n\\[ T(P^2*T - P - 0.5*T + 0.5) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two possibilities: T = 0 or P^2*T - P - 0.5*T + 0.5 = 0.\n\nBut T = 0 doesn't make sense in this context because there are balls in the box, so T > 0.\n\nSo, we're left with:\n\n\\[ P^2*T - P - 0.5*T + 0.5 = 0 \\]\n\nThis still looks complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet's think about the probability differently. The probability of picking two red balls in a row without replacement is the same as the probability that the first ball is red multiplied by the probability that the second ball is red given that the first one was red.\n\nSo, P(both red) = P(first red) * P(second red | first red)\n\nWe know P(both red) = 0.5.\n\nP(first red) = R/T\n\nP(second red | first red) = (R - 1)/(T - 1)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{R}{T} \\times \\frac{R - 1}{T - 1} = 0.5 \\]\n\nWait a minute, this is the same as our earlier equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R(R-1)}{T(T-1)} = 0.5 \\]\n\nSo, we're back to the same point.\n\nMaybe instead of expressing in terms of T, we can assume a specific number of balls to make it easier.\n\nLet's assume there are T balls in total. We can try small values of T and see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nFor example, let's try T = 2.\n\nThen, R(R - 1) = 0.5 * 2 * 1 = 1\n\nSo, R(R - 1) = 1\n\nPossible R values: if R = 2, 2*1 = 2 \u2260 1\n\nNot satisfied.\n\nT = 3.\n\nR(R - 1) = 0.5 * 3 * 2 = 3\n\nSo, R(R - 1) = 3\n\nPossible R: R = 3, 3*2=6 \u22603; R=2,2*1=2\u22603; R=1,1*0=0\u22603.\n\nNo solution.\n\nT = 4.\n\nR(R - 1) = 0.5 * 4 * 3 = 6\n\nR(R - 1) = 6\n\nR=3,3*2=6. Yes!\n\nSo, R=3, T=4, which means B=1.\n\nFraction of red balls is 3/4.\n\nBut let's check if this satisfies the original condition.\n\nC(3,2)/C(4,2) = 3/6 = 0.5. Yes, it works.\n\nBut maybe there are other solutions for larger T.\n\nLet's try T=5.\n\nR(R - 1) = 0.5 * 5 * 4 = 10\n\nR(R - 1) = 10\n\nR=5,5*4=20\u226010; R=4,4*3=12\u226010; R=3,3*2=6\u226010; R=2,2*1=2\u226010; R=1,1*0=0\u226010.\n\nNo solution.\n\nT=6.\n\nR(R - 1) = 0.5 * 6 * 5 = 15\n\nR(R - 1) =15\n\nR=5,5*4=20\u226015; R=4,4*3=12\u226015; R=3,3*2=6\u226015; R=2,2*1=2\u226015; R=1,1*0=0\u226015.\n\nNo solution.\n\nT=7.\n\nR(R - 1) = 0.5 * 7 * 6 = 21\n\nR(R - 1) =21\n\nR=6,6*5=30\u226021; R=5,5*4=20\u226021; R=4,4*3=12\u226021; R=3,3*2=6\u226021; R=2,2*1=2\u226021; R=1,1*0=0\u226021.\n\nNo solution.\n\nT=8.\n\nR(R - 1) = 0.5 * 8 * 7 = 28\n\nR(R - 1) =28\n\nR=7,7*6=42\u226028; R=6,6*5=30\u226028; R=5,5*4=20\u226028; R=4,4*3=12\u226028; R=3,3*2=6\u226028; R=2,2*1=2\u226028; R=1,1*0=0\u226028.\n\nNo solution.\n\nIt seems like T=4 with R=3 is the only small solution. But maybe there are larger solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a general solution we can find.\n\nLet's go back to the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R(R-1)}{T(T-1)} = 0.5 \\]\n\nWe can rearrange this to:\n\n\\[ R(R-1) = 0.5 T(T-1) \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ 2R(R-1) = T(T-1) \\]\n\nNow, since T = R + B, and B is positive, T > R.\n\nLet\u2019s consider T = R + k, where k is a positive integer representing the number of blue balls.\n\nSubstitute T = R + k into the equation:\n\n\\[ 2R(R-1) = (R + k)(R + k - 1) \\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[ 2R^2 - 2R = R^2 + R(k - 1) + k(R + k - 1) \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't look right.\n\nLet me expand (R + k)(R + k - 1) correctly:\n\n(R + k)(R + k - 1) = R(R + k - 1) + k(R + k - 1) = R^2 + R(k - 1) + kR + k(k - 1)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct expansion.\n\nActually, (R + k)(R + k - 1) = R(R + k - 1) + k(R + k - 1) = R^2 + R(k - 1) + kR + k(k - 1)\n\nBut simplifying:\n\nR^2 + Rk - R + kR + k^2 - k = R^2 + 2Rk - R + k^2 - k\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the equation:\n\n\\[ 2R(R - 1) = T(T - 1) \\]\n\nWe can look for integer solutions where T > R and T = R + k for some positive integer k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can treat this as a quadratic in terms of R.\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ 2R^2 - 2R - T^2 + T = 0 \\]\n\nBut T = R + k, so substitute T with R + k:\n\n\\[ 2R^2 - 2R - (R + k)^2 + (R + k) = 0 \\]\n\nExpand (R + k)^2:\n\n\\[ 2R^2 - 2R - (R^2 + 2Rk + k^2) + R + k = 0 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ 2R^2 - 2R - R^2 - 2Rk - k^2 + R + k = 0 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ R^2 - R - 2Rk - k^2 + k = 0 \\]\n\nThis still seems messy. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the ratio P = R/T, which is the fraction of red balls we're trying to find.\n\nFrom P = R/T, we can write R = P*T.\n\nSubstitute R = P*T into the equation:\n\n\\[ 2(P*T)(P*T - 1) = T(T - 1) \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ 2P^2 T^2 - 2P T = T^2 - T \\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ 2P^2 T^2 - 2P T - T^2 + T = 0 \\]\n\nFactor T:\n\n\\[ T(2P^2 T - 2P - T + 1) = 0 \\]\n\nAgain, T \u2260 0, so:\n\n\\[ 2P^2 T - 2P - T + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we can consider this as a quadratic in P.\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange:\n\n\\[ 2P^2 T - 2P - T + 1 = 0 \\]\n\n Treat T as a constant since we're solving for P.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of P:\n\n\\[ 2T P^2 - 2P - T + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for P:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 8T(T - 1)}}{4T} \\]\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n\\[ 4 + 8T^2 - 8T = 8T^2 - 8T + 4 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8T^2 - 8T + 4}}{4T} \\]\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the probability of picking two red balls is 0.5, which is 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{R(R - 1)}{T(T - 1)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[ 2R(R - 1) = T(T - 1) \\]\n\nNow, let's think of this as aDiophantine equation, where R and T are positive integers with R \u2264 T.\n\nWe can look for integer solutions to this equation.\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange:\n\n\\[ 2R^2 - 2R - T^2 + T = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic in R:\n\n\\[ 2R^2 - 2R - (T^2 - T) = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula for R:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 8(T^2 - T)}}{4} \\]\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n\\[ 4 + 8T^2 - 8T = 8T^2 - 8T + 4 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8T^2 - 8T + 4}}{4} \\]\n\nThis can be simplified further:\n\nFactor out a 4 from the square root:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4(2T^2 - 2T + 1)}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2T^2 - 2T + 1}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2T^2 - 2T + 1}}{2} \\]\n\nFor R to be an integer, the expression under the square root must be a perfect square.\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\n\\[ 2T^2 - 2T + 1 = K^2 \\]\n\nFor some integer K.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 2T^2 - 2T + 1 - K^2 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic in T:\n\n\\[ 2T^2 - 2T + (1 - K^2) = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula for T:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8(1 - K^2)}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8 + 8K^2}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8K^2 - 4}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2K^2 - 1}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2K^2 - 1}}{2} \\]\n\nFor T to be an integer, \\sqrt{2K^2 - 1} must be an integer, say M.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2K^2 - 1} = M \\]\n\n\\[ 2K^2 - 1 = M^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 2K^2 - M^2 = 1 \\]\n\nThis is a Pell equation of the form:\n\n\\[ M^2 - 2K^2 = -1 \\]\n\nPell equations have infinitely many solutions, which can be found using the fundamental solution and generating more solutions from it.\n\nThe fundamental solution for M^2 - 2K^2 = -1 is M=1, K=1.\n\nFrom this, larger solutions can be generated using recurrence relations.\n\nBut this seems too complicated for our problem. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that we're looking for T such that 2T^2 - 2T + 1 is a perfect square.\n\nLet\u2019s try small values of T again:\n\nT=1:\n\n2(1)^2 - 2(1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 =1, which is 1^2. So, K=1.\n\nThen, R = [1 \u00b1 1]/2.\n\nSo, R=(1+1)/2=1 or (1-1)/2=0.\n\nBut R=0 doesn't make sense if there are red balls, so R=1.\n\nBut if T=1 and R=1, then picking two balls at once isn't possible, so this is invalid.\n\nT=2:\n\n2(2)^2 - 2(2) +1=8-4+1=5, which is not a perfect square.\n\nT=3:\n\n2(3)^2 -2(3)+1=18-6+1=13, not a perfect square.\n\nT=4:\n\n2(4)^2 -2(4)+1=32-8+1=25, which is 5^2.\n\nSo, K=5.\n\nThen, R=[1 \u00b1 5]/2.\n\nR=(1+5)/2=3 or (1-5)/2=-2 (invalid).\n\nSo, R=3.\n\nThis matches our earlier solution.\n\nT=4, R=3.\n\nFraction of red balls is 3/4.\n\nLet\u2019s check T=5:\n\n2(5)^2 -2(5)+1=50-10+1=41, not a perfect square.\n\nT=6:\n\n2(6)^2 -2(6)+1=72-12+1=61, not a perfect square.\n\nT=7:\n\n2(7)^2 -2(7)+1=98-14+1=85, not a perfect square.\n\nT=8:\n\n2(8)^2 -2(8)+1=128-16+1=113, not a perfect square.\n\nT=9:\n\n2(9)^2 -2(9)+1=162-18+1=145, not a perfect square.\n\nT=10:\n\n2(10)^2 -2(10)+1=200-20+1=181, not a perfect square.\n\nIt seems like T=4 and T=1 are the only small solutions, but T=1 doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is T=4, R=3.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of red balls is 3/4.\n\nBut wait, is this the only possible solution?\n\nLooking back at the Pell equation, there are infinitely many solutions, but larger solutions may not be practical for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other solutions for larger T, but they may not be practical for a box of balls.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of red balls is 3/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}} \\]"
