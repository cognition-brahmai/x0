        "content": "Machu Picchu was built by the Inca civilization. This ancient city, often called the \"Lost City of the Incas,\" is situated high in the Andes Mountains and was likely constructed in the 15th century. It remained unknown to the outside world until its rediscovery in 1911 by Hiram Bingham. The site is believed to have been a royal estate or sacred religious site for Inca leaders, chosen for its unique geographic location and natural beauty. Today, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most iconic symbols of the Incan Empire."
