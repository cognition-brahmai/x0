        "content": "Let's see. So, the factory starts by producing 500 units every day. Then, every week, the production rate increases by 50 units per day. I need to find out how many units will be produced on the 15th day.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's happening with the production rate. It starts at 500 units per day and increases by 50 units per day every week. But since weeks have 7 days, I need to figure out how many weeks have passed by the 15th day.\n\nLet me calculate how many weeks are in 15 days. There are 7 days in a week, so 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day (since 14 days are 2 weeks, and there's 1 day left over).\n\nNow, the production rate increases by 50 units per day every week. So, after 2 weeks, the production rate should have increased by 50 units per day twice.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nInitial production rate: 500 units/day\n\nAfter 1 week: 500 + 50 = 550 units/day\n\nAfter 2 weeks: 550 + 50 = 600 units/day\n\nSo, by the start of the third week, the production rate is 600 units per day.\n\nNow, since the 15th day is the first day of the third week, the production rate on that day should be 600 units per day.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to confirm if the increase happens at the start of each week or at the end of each week. The problem says \"every week,\" which might mean that the increase happens at the start of each week.\n\nAssuming the increase happens at the start of each week:\n\n- Days 1 to 7: 500 units/day\n\n- Day 8: increase by 50, so 550 units/day\n\n- Days 8 to 14: 550 units/day\n\n- Day 15: increase by 50, so 600 units/day\n\nTherefore, on the 15th day, the production rate is 600 units per day.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 600 units on the 15th day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
