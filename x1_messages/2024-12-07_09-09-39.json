        "content": "So the amusement park wants to increase its daily revenue by 20% without changing the proportion of visitors in each category. Currently, they have 60% adults, 30% children, and 10% seniors. The current ticket prices are $50 for adults, $35 for children, and $40 for seniors. They want to adjust the prices to achieve this revenue increase while keeping the same ratio between the ticket prices for each category.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to maintain the same ratio between the ticket prices. Let's look at the current ratios:\n\n- Adult to Child: $50 / $35 = 10/7 \u2248 1.4286\n\n- Adult to Senior: $50 / $40 = 5/4 = 1.25\n\n- Senior to Child: $40 / $35 \u2248 1.1429\n\nSo, the ratios are:\n\n- Adult : Child : Senior = 50 : 35 : 40\n\nWe can simplify this ratio by dividing each part by 5:\n\n- 50/5 : 35/5 : 40/5 = 10 : 7 : 8\n\nSo, the simplified ratio is 10:7:8 for Adult:Child:Senior.\n\nNow, let's denote the new ticket prices as:\n\n- Adult: 10k\n\n- Child: 7k\n\n- Senior: 8k\n\nWhere k is a multiplier that we need to determine.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the current daily revenue and then find out what the target revenue is.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are N visitors in total each day.\n\nThen, the number of visitors in each category is:\n\n- Adults: 0.60N\n\n- Children: 0.30N\n\n- Seniors: 0.10N\n\nThe current total revenue (R) is:\n\nR = (0.60N * $50) + (0.30N * $35) + (0.10N * $40)\n\nLet's compute this:\n\nR = (0.60N * 50) + (0.30N * 35) + (0.10N * 40)\n\nR = (30N) + (10.5N) + (4N)\n\nR = 44.5N\n\nThe target revenue is 20% higher than the current revenue, so:\n\nTarget Revenue (R_target) = R + 0.20R = 1.20R\n\nR_target = 1.20 * 44.5N = 53.4N\n\nNow, with the new ticket prices, the total revenue should be equal to the target revenue.\n\nSo, the new total revenue (R_new) is:\n\nR_new = (0.60N * 10k) + (0.30N * 7k) + (0.10N * 8k)\n\nSimplify this:\n\nR_new = (6N * 10k) + (0.3N * 7k) + (0.1N * 8k)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let's correct that.\n\nActually, 0.60N is already the number of adults, so:\n\nR_new = (0.60N * 10k) + (0.30N * 7k) + (0.10N * 8k)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's factor out N and k:\n\nR_new = Nk * (0.60*10 + 0.30*7 + 0.10*8)\n\nCalculate inside the parentheses:\n\n0.60*10 = 6\n\n0.30*7 = 2.1\n\n0.10*8 = 0.8\n\nSum = 6 + 2.1 + 0.8 = 8.9\n\nSo, R_new = Nk * 8.9\n\nWe know that R_new should equal R_target, which is 53.4N.\n\nTherefore:\n\nNk * 8.9 = 53.4N\n\nWe can divide both sides by N (assuming N \u2260 0):\n\nk * 8.9 = 53.4\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nk = 53.4 / 8.9\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nk = 53.4 / 8.9 \u2248 6.0\n\nSo, k \u2248 6.0\n\nNow, we can find the new ticket prices:\n\n- Adult: 10k = 10 * 6 = $60\n\n- Child: 7k = 7 * 6 = $42\n\n- Senior: 8k = 8 * 6 = $48\n\nWait a minute, let's check if this actually achieves the 20% revenue increase.\n\nLet's calculate the new revenue with these prices:\n\nR_new = (0.60N * 60) + (0.30N * 42) + (0.10N * 48)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.60N * 60 = 36N\n\n0.30N * 42 = 12.6N\n\n0.10N * 48 = 4.8N\n\nTotal R_new = 36N + 12.6N + 4.8N = 53.4N\n\nYes, this matches the target revenue of 53.4N, which is a 20% increase from the original 44.5N.\n\nSo, the new ticket prices should be:\n\n- Adult: $60\n\n- Child: $42\n\n- Senior: $48\n\nBut, let's double-check the ratio to ensure it's maintained.\n\nOriginal ratio: 10:7:8\n\nNew prices: 60:42:48\n\nLet's divide each new price by 6 to see if we get the original ratio:\n\n60 / 6 = 10\n\n42 / 6 = 7\n\n48 / 6 = 8\n\nYes, it matches the original ratio of 10:7:8.\n\nTherefore, the park should set the new ticket prices as follows to achieve a 20% increase in daily revenue without changing the visitor proportions:\n\n- Adult: $60\n\n- Child: $42\n\n- Senior: $48\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Adult: } \\$60, \\text{ Child: } \\$42, \\text{ Senior: } \\$48} \\]"
