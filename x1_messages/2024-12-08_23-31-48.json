        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 widgets every hour, and it operates 24 hours a day for a whole week. I need to find out how many widgets are produced in that week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many hours there are in a day. Well, that's easy: 24 hours.\n\nNext, how many days are there in a week? Typically, there are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, total hours in a week would be 24 hours/day multiplied by 7 days, which is 24 * 7 = 168 hours.\n\nNow, if the factory produces 200 widgets every hour, then in 168 hours, it would produce 200 widgets/hour * 168 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that: 200 * 168.\n\nHmm, 200 multiplied by 100 is 20,000, and 200 multiplied by 60 is 12,000, and 200 multiplied by 8 is 1,600. So, 20,000 + 12,000 + 1,600 = 33,600.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 33,600 widgets in one week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the daily production first. If the factory produces 200 widgets per hour and operates 24 hours a day, then daily production is 200 * 24 = 4,800 widgets per day.\n\nThen, over 7 days, it would be 4,800 * 7.\n\nLet's compute that: 4,800 * 7.\n\n7 times 4,000 is 28,000, and 7 times 800 is 5,600. So, 28,000 + 5,600 = 33,600.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 33,600 widgets in one week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any breaks or downtime in the factory. The question says the factory operates 24 hours a day, so no breaks, which means it's running continuously.\n\nAlso, it specifies \"every hour,\" so the production rate is constant.\n\nTherefore, the calculation should be straightforward: production rate multiplied by total operating time.\n\nSo, 200 widgets/hour * 168 hours/week = 33,600 widgets/week.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33600} \\]"
