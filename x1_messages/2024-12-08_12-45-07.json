        "content": "So I've got this question about light hitting a glass-air interface at an angle bigger than the critical angle. I need to figure out what happens to the light in that situation. Let's see, the options are:\n\nA. It's completely absorbed by the glass.\n\nB. It's partially reflected and partially refracted.\n\nC. It's completely refracted into the air.\n\nD. It's completely reflected back into the glass.\n\nE. Both A and C.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the critical angle is. I think it has something to do with when light tries to pass from a denser medium to a less dense one, and at a certain angle, instead of refracting, it gets reflected back inside the denser medium. That's total internal reflection, right?\n\nSo, in this case, the glass is the denser medium, and air is the less dense one. If the light is incident at an angle greater than the critical angle, then total internal reflection should occur, meaning the light stays inside the glass and gets reflected back.\n\nLooking at the options, that seems to match with option D: It is completely reflected back into the glass.\n\nBut let's make sure about this. Option A says it's completely absorbed by the glass. I don't think that's correct because in total internal reflection, the light doesn't get absorbed; it gets reflected.\n\nOption B says it's partially reflected and partially refracted. But in total internal reflection, there's no refraction; it's all reflection. So that can't be right.\n\nOption C says it's completely refracted into the air. Again, that contradicts with the concept of total internal reflection.\n\nOption E combines A and C, which also doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, based on my understanding of total internal reflection, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check what happens exactly at the critical angle and beyond. The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the refracted angle becomes 90 degrees. Beyond that angle, total internal reflection occurs, meaning no refraction takes place, and all the light is reflected back into the glass.\n\nI think that confirms that option D is the best description.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where some absorption might occur. I know that in real materials, there can be some absorption of light, but in the context of this question, which seems to be focusing on the behavior at the interface based on the angle of incidence, I think absorption is not the main point here.\n\nMoreover, the question asks for the best description, and given that total internal reflection is a well-established phenomenon, I'm confident that option D is the correct choice.\n\nSo, to sum it up, when light hits a glass-air interface at an angle greater than the critical angle, it is completely reflected back into the glass.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
