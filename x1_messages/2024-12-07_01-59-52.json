        "content": "Sure! Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical concept where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. The triangle starts with a single '1' at the top, and each subsequent row contains one more entry than the previous one.\n\nTo create a Python script that generates Pascal's Triangle with 'n' rows, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Accept an integer 'n' from the user, which represents the number of rows in the Pascal's Triangle.\n\n2. **Triangle Generation**:\n   - Initialize an empty list to hold the rows of the triangle.\n   - For each row 'i' from 0 to n-1:\n     - Create a new row with 'i+1' elements.\n     - The first and last elements of each row are always 1.\n     - For elements in between, calculate their value as the sum of the two elements directly above them from the previous row.\n\n3. **Formatted Display**:\n   - Determine the width needed to display the last row centered.\n   - For each row, format and print the numbers, center-aligned with respect to the last row.\n\nHere's a Python script that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pascals_triangle(n):\n    triangle = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = [1] * (i + 1)\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            row[j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]\n        triangle.append(row)\n    return triangle\n\ndef print_pascals_triangle(triangle):\n    # Find the maximum number in the last row to determine the width\n    max_num = triangle[-1][len(triangle[-1]) // 2]\n    num_digits = len(str(max_num))\n    width = num_digits + 2  # Add space for formatting\n\n    for row in triangle:\n        formatted_row = ' '.join(f\"{num:{width}d}\" for num in row)\n        print(formatted_row.center(width * len(triangle[-1])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows for Pascal's Triangle: \"))\n    triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)\n    print_pascals_triangle(triangle)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **generate_pascals_triangle(n)**:\n   - This function generates the Pascal's Triangle up to 'n' rows.\n   - It initializes an empty list `triangle` to hold the rows.\n   - For each row index 'i' from 0 to n-1, it creates a row with 'i+1' elements, all initially set to 1.\n   - For each element in between the first and last in the row, it calculates the value as the sum of the two elements directly above it from the previous row.\n   - It appends the row to `triangle` and returns the complete triangle once all rows are generated.\n\n2. **print_pascals_triangle(triangle)**:\n   - This function prints the generated Pascal's Triangle in a formatted manner.\n   - It determines the width needed for displaying the numbers by finding the maximum number in the last row and calculating the number of digits.\n   - It then iterates through each row, formats the numbers with the determined width, and centers the row based on the width of the last row.\n\n3. **Main Execution**:\n   - The script accepts an integer input 'n' from the user.\n   - It generates the Pascal's Triangle with 'n' rows using the `generate_pascals_triangle` function.\n   - It prints the triangle in a formatted manner using the `print_pascals_triangle` function.\n\nThis script ensures that the triangle is displayed centrally aligned, making it visually appealing and easier to understand."
