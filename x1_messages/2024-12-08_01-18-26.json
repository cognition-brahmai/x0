        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the car travels at 45 mph for 2.5 hours. To find the distance for this part, I can use the formula distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, 45 mph times 2.5 hours should give me the first part of the journey.\n\nLet me calculate that: 45 times 2.5. 45 times 2 is 90, and 45 times 0.5 is 22.5, so total distance for the first part is 90 plus 22.5, which is 112.5 miles.\n\nThen, the car stops for 30 minutes. Since it's not moving during this time, there's no distance added here. So, I can just ignore this stop for the distance calculation.\n\nAfter the stop, the car continues traveling at 55 mph for another 3 hours. Again, using the distance formula: 55 mph times 3 hours. That's 55 times 3, which is 165 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance covered, I need to add the distances from both parts of the journey: 112.5 miles plus 165 miles.\n\nLet's add those up: 112.5 plus 165. 112.5 plus 165 is 277.5 miles.\n\nSo, the total distance covered by the car is 277.5 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{277.5 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
