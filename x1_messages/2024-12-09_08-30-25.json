        "content": "To design an SQL query that retrieves information from the \"orders\", \"customers\", and \"products\" tables, specifically targeting customers who have placed orders in the last 30 days, along with the total value of their orders and the most expensive product they purchased during this period, we need to consider the relationships between these tables and perform appropriate joins and aggregations.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The \"orders\" table has fields such as order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, and order_value.\n2. The \"customers\" table has fields like customer_id, customer_name, etc.\n3. The \"products\" table has fields like product_id, product_name, product_price, etc.\n4. The order_date field in the \"orders\" table is of a date or datetime type.\n\nGiven these assumptions, the query can be structured as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    c.customer_id,\n    c.customer_name,\n    SUM(o.order_value) AS total_order_value,\n    MAX(p.product_price) AS most_expensive_product\nFROM \n    customers c\nJOIN \n    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\nJOIN \n    products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id\nWHERE \n    o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)\nGROUP BY \n    c.customer_id, c.customer_name;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Joins**: We join the \"customers\" table with the \"orders\" table on customer_id to link customers with their orders. Then, we join the \"orders\" table with the \"products\" table on product_id to link orders with the products they contain.\n2. **Filtering**: The WHERE clause filters orders placed in the last 30 days using the order_date field.\n3. **Aggregations**: We use SUM to calculate the total order value for each customer and MAX to find the highest product price among the products they ordered.\n4. **Grouping**: Results are grouped by customer_id and customer_name to aggregate data per customer.\n\nThis query provides a list of customers who have ordered in the last 30 days, along with the total value of their orders and the price of the most expensive product they purchased during this period."
