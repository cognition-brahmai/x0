        "content": "So the factory usually makes 250 units of product A each day. They want to increase production by 20% because there's more demand. I need to find out how many extra units that is and what the new total production will be per day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 20% of 250 units is. To calculate a percentage of a number, I can multiply the number by the percentage and then divide by 100. So, 20% of 250 is (20/100) * 250.\n\nLet me do the math: 20 divided by 100 is 0.2, and 0.2 multiplied by 250 is 50. So, the additional units they will produce per day are 50.\n\nNow, to find the new daily production rate, I need to add those additional units to the original production amount. So, 250 units plus 50 units equals 300 units.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. Original production is 250 units. 20% of 250 is 50 units. Adding that to the original amount gives 300 units per day.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate percentage increases by multiplying the original amount by (1 + the percentage increase). So, in this case, it would be 250 multiplied by (1 + 0.20), which is 250 * 1.20.\n\nLet me try that: 250 * 1.20 = 300 units. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the additional units produced per day are 50, and the new daily production rate is 300 units.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should verify this with another method. If a 20% increase on 250 units is 50 units, then the total should indeed be 300 units.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If 100% of production is 250 units, then 20% is 50 units, and 120% would be 300 units.\n\nWait a minute, another way to look at it: if they increase production by 20%, that means they're producing 120% of the original amount.\n\nSo, 120% of 250 units is (120/100) * 250 = 1.20 * 250 = 300 units.\n\nAgain, that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider if the percentage increase was on a different basis or if there were any other factors to consider, but according to the problem, it's a straightforward 20% increase on the daily production of 250 units.\n\nSo, the additional units produced per day are 50, and the new daily production rate is 300 units.\n\nI think that's clear and correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe additional units produced per day are \\boxed{50}, and the new daily production rate is \\boxed{300} units."
