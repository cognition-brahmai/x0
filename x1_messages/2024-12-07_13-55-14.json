        "content": "Yes, eating turkey can make you feel sleepy, but it's not just because of the turkey itself. Turkey contains an amino acid called tryptophan, which is a precursor to serotonin and melatonin\u2014hormones that regulate sleep and mood. However, tryptophan isn't unique to turkey; it's found in many protein-rich foods.\n\nThe reason why people often feel sleepy after Thanksgiving dinner, for example, isn't just because of the turkey but also due to the large meal itself. Eating a big meal causes blood flow to shift towards the digestive system to help break down and process the food. This diversion of blood and energy away from other bodily functions can make you feel tired or sleepy.\n\nAdditionally, holiday meals often come with other factors like alcohol consumption and the general relaxing atmosphere, which can contribute to feelings of sleepiness.\n\nSo, while turkey does contain tryptophan, it's the combination of factors including the size of the meal and post-meal activities that typically cause that post-feast sleepiness."
