        "content": "So, there are 8 planets in our solar system, and each one orbits the Sun at a different speed. The question is, how many unique pairs of planets can be formed from these 8?\n\nHmm, I think this is a combinations problem. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, right? So, if I'm picking pairs of planets, and the order doesn't matter\u2014that is, picking Planet A and then Planet B is the same as picking Planet B and then Planet A\u2014then I should use the combination formula.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 8, and k is 2, since we're forming pairs.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!).\n\nFirst, I need to calculate 8!, which is 8 factorial. That's 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 40320.\n\nThen, 2! is 2 \u00d7 1 = 2.\n\nAnd (8 - 2)! is 6!, which is 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 720.\n\nSo, C(8, 2) = 40320 / (2 \u00d7 720) = 40320 / 1440 = 28.\n\nWait, but I remember that the combination formula for pairs is also equal to n(n - 1)/2. Let me check if that gives the same result.\n\nSo, n = 8, so 8 \u00d7 7 / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, there are 28 unique pairs of planets that can be formed from the 8 planets in our solar system.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. If we have 8 planets, and we want to pick 2 of them, and the order doesn't matter, then indeed, it's 28.\n\nAlternatively, if the order did matter, it would be permutations, which is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!.\n\nSo, P(8, 2) = 8! / (8 - 2)! = 40320 / 720 = 56.\n\nBut in this case, order doesn't matter, so it's half of that, which is 28. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out the pairs. Starting with Planet 1, it can pair with Planets 2 through 8, that's 7 pairs. Then, Planet 2 can pair with Planets 3 through 8, that's 6 pairs. Planet 3 pairs with Planets 4 through 8, which is 5 pairs. And so on, down to Planet 7 pairing with Planet 8.\n\nSo, total pairs are 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28.\n\nYep, that matches all the other methods.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 28 unique pairs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
