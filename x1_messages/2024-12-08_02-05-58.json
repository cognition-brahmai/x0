        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that reads numbers from a text file, where each number is on a new line. Then, I need to calculate the mean, median, and mode of these numbers and print them out. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I handle everything correctly, like reading the file and dealing with possible errors.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to read the numbers from the file. Assuming the file contains one number per line, I can open the file, read each line, convert it to a number (probably a float, to handle decimals), and store them in a list. I should also consider what happens if the file doesn't exist or if there are non-numeric values in the file.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the mean, which is the average of the numbers. That's just the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. For the median, I need to find the middle value when the numbers are sorted. If there's an even number of elements, it's the average of the two middle numbers. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. If there are multiple numbers with the same highest frequency, it's multimodal, but for simplicity, I'll assume there's only one mode.\n\nI think I should use built-in Python functions and modules to make this easier. For the mean, I can use the `sum()` function and `len()` to count the numbers. For the median, I'll need to sort the list and then find the middle value(s). For the mode, I can use the `statistics` module, which has a `mode()` function.\n\nBut I should also consider edge cases, like if the file is empty, or if all numbers are the same, or if there are negative numbers. I need to make sure my script handles these situations correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Open the file and read the numbers into a list.\n\n2. Convert the read lines into numbers.\n\n3. Calculate the mean.\n\n4. Calculate the median.\n\n5. Calculate the mode.\n\n6. Print the results.\n\nI need to handle possible errors, like the file not existing or having non-numeric values in the file. I can use try-except blocks for this.\n\nAlso, I should think about the user experience. Maybe ask for the file name as input, or specify it in the script. For now, I'll hardcode the file name in the script for simplicity.\n\nLet me start by writing some pseudocode:\n\n```\n\nOpen the file\n\nRead all lines\n\nClose the file\n\nInitialize an empty list to store numbers\n\nFor each line:\n\nStrip any extra whitespace\n\nIf the line is not empty:\n\nTry to convert it to a float\n\nAdd it to the numbers list\n\nExcept if it's not a number:\n\nPrint an error message and skip to the next line\n\nIf no numbers were read:\n\nPrint an error message and exit\n\nCalculate the mean:\n\nSum of numbers divided by the count of numbers\n\nCalculate the median:\n\nSort the list of numbers\n\nIf the count is odd:\n\nMedian is the middle element\n\nIf even:\n\nMedian is the average of the two middle elements\n\nCalculate the mode:\n\nUse the statistics.mode() function\n\nPrint the mean, median, and mode\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a good plan. Now, I need to translate this into actual Python code.\n\nI should also consider if the file is very large. Reading all lines at once might not be efficient, but for now, I'll assume the file is small enough to handle in memory.\n\nLet me think about the data types. Since numbers can be integers or floats, I'll convert them to floats to cover both cases.\n\nAlso, for the mode, if there are multiple modes, the `statistics.mode()` function will raise a `StatisticsError`. I need to handle this possibility.\n\nMaybe I should use the `collections.Counter` class to find the mode, which can handle multiple modes more gracefully.\n\nHere's an updated plan for calculating the mode:\n\n- Use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each number.\n\n- Find the maximum frequency.\n\n- Find all numbers that have this maximum frequency.\n\n- If there's only one such number, that's the mode.\n\n- If there are multiple, I can either report all of them or just pick one. For simplicity, I'll report the first one.\n\nThis way, I can handle cases with multiple modes without errors.\n\nLet me adjust the pseudocode accordingly:\n\n```\n\nOpen the file\n\nRead all lines\n\nClose the file\n\nInitialize an empty list to store numbers\n\nFor each line:\n\nStrip any extra whitespace\n\nIf the line is not empty:\n\nTry to convert it to a float\n\nAdd it to the numbers list\n\nExcept if it's not a number:\n\nPrint an error message and skip to the next line\n\nIf no numbers were read:\n\nPrint an error message and exit\n\nCalculate the mean:\n\nSum of numbers divided by the count of numbers\n\nCalculate the median:\n\nSort the list of numbers\n\nIf the count is odd:\n\nMedian is the middle element\n\nIf even:\n\nMedian is the average of the two middle elements\n\nCalculate the mode:\n\nUse collections.Counter to count frequencies\n\nFind the maximum frequency\n\nFind all numbers with this frequency\n\nMode is the first number in this list\n\nPrint the mean, median, and mode\n\n```\n\nThis should work. Now, let's think about how to implement this in code.\n\nI'll need to import the `statistics` module for the median calculation, and the `collections` module for the Counter class.\n\nWait, actually, for the median, I can sort the list and calculate it without using `statistics`, but using `statistics.median()` might be simpler and less error-prone.\n\nSimilarly, for the mode, I can use `statistics.mode()`, but I need to handle the case where there are multiple modes.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's better to stick with `collections.Counter` for the mode to avoid errors.\n\nLet me write some sample code to see how this would look.\n\nFirst, opening and reading the file:\n\n```\n\ntry:\n\nwith open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n\nlines = file.readlines()\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\nprint(\"Error: File not found.\")\n\nexit()\n\n```\n\nThen, processing the lines:\n\n```\n\nnumbers = []\n\nfor line in lines:\n\nline = line.strip()\n\nif line:\n\ntry:\n\nnum = float(line)\n\nnumbers.append(num)\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(f\"Warning: '{line}' is not a valid number and will be ignored.\")\n\nif not numbers:\n\nprint(\"Error: No valid numbers found in the file.\")\n\nexit()\n\n```\n\nCalculating the mean:\n\n```\n\nmean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n```\n\nCalculating the median using `statistics`:\n\n```\n\nimport statistics\n\nmedian = statistics.median(numbers)\n\n```\n\nCalculating the mode using `collections.Counter`:\n\n```\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncount = Counter(numbers)\n\nmax_freq = max(count.values())\n\nmode = [num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == max_freq][0]\n\n```\n\nFinally, printing the results:\n\n```\n\nprint(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n\nprint(f\"Median: {median}\")\n\nprint(f\"Mode: {mode}\")\n\n```\n\nThis looks good. Let me think about possible edge cases and how to handle them.\n\n1. Empty file: Already handled by checking if `numbers` list is empty.\n\n2. File with no numbers (only non-numeric lines): Also handled by checking if `numbers` list is empty.\n\n3. File with only one number: Mean, median, and mode should all be that number.\n\n4. File with negative numbers: Should handle them correctly since we're using floats.\n\n5. File with all numbers same: Mean, median, and mode are all the same.\n\n6. File with multiple modes: Currently, the code picks the first one encountered. If needed, I can modify it to return all modes.\n\nFor now, I'll stick with returning the first mode.\n\nI should also think about the precision of the mean and median. Maybe I want to round them to a certain number of decimal places for better readability.\n\nLet's say I round them to 2 decimal places.\n\nI can modify the print statements like this:\n\n```\n\nprint(f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n\nprint(f\"Median: {median:.2f}\")\n\nprint(f\"Mode: {mode}\")\n\n```\n\nThis will round the mean and median to 2 decimal places.\n\nNow, let's consider writing the complete script.\n\nI'll also add some comments for clarity.\n\nHere's the complete script:\n\n```\n\nimport statistics\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n\ntry:\n\nwith open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n\nlines = file.readlines()\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\nprint(\"Error: File not found.\")\n\nreturn\n\nnumbers = []\n\nfor line in lines:\n\nline = line.strip()\n\nif line:\n\ntry:\n\nnum = float(line)\n\nnumbers.append(num)\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint(f\"Warning: '{line}' is not a valid number and will be ignored.\")\n\nif not numbers:\n\nprint(\"Error: No valid numbers found in the file.\")\n\nreturn\n\nmean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\nmedian = statistics.median(numbers)\n\ncount = Counter(numbers)\n\nmax_freq = max(count.values())\n\nmode = [num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == max_freq][0]\n\nprint(f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n\nprint(f\"Median: {median:.2f}\")\n\nprint(f\"Mode: {mode}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nmain()\n\n```\n\nThis should work for most cases. Let me test it with some sample inputs.\n\nSample input file (numbers.txt):\n\n```\n\n3.5\n\n2.1\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n5.5\n\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\nMean: 3.90\n\nMedian: 3.50\n\nMode: 3.5\n\nLet me verify:\n\nSum = 3.5 + 2.1 + 3.5 + 4.0 + 5.5 = 18.6\n\nCount = 5\n\nMean = 18.6 / 5 = 3.72\n\nWait, that doesn't match my expected output. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, 3.5 + 2.1 + 3.5 + 4.0 + 5.5 = 18.6\n\n18.6 / 5 = 3.72\n\nSo, Mean: 3.72\n\nSorted numbers: 2.1, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.5\n\nMedian: 3.5\n\nMode: 3.5 (appears twice)\n\nSo, the expected output should be:\n\nMean: 3.72\n\nMedian: 3.50\n\nMode: 3.5\n\nI think I made a typo earlier.\n\nLet me adjust the expected output accordingly.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nnumbers.txt:\n\n```\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\nMean: 2.50\n\nMedian: 2.50\n\nMode: 3\n\nCalculations:\n\nSum = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 18\n\nCount = 7\n\nMean = 18 / 7 \u2248 2.571\n\nMedian: Sorted numbers = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4], middle value is 3\n\nWait, no. For an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value.\n\nHere, the sorted list is [1,2,2,3,3,3,4], the 4th element is 3.\n\nSo, Median: 3\n\nMode: 3 (appears most frequently)\n\nSo, output should be:\n\nMean: 2.57\n\nMedian: 3.00\n\nMode: 3\n\nWait, but my earlier calculation for mean was 18 / 7 = 2.571, which rounded to 2.57.\n\nBut in the code, I have `mean:.2f`, which would round to 2.57.\n\nSimilarly, median is 3.00.\n\nI need to make sure that the median is correctly calculated.\n\nWait, in this case, my earlier code uses `statistics.median()`, which should correctly handle this.\n\nLet me check the `statistics.median()` function.\n\nAccording to Python's documentation, `statistics.median()` sorts the data and then returns the middle value for odd lengths, or the average of the two middle values for even lengths.\n\nIn this case, with 7 elements, it should return the 4th element, which is 3.\n\nSo, that should be correct.\n\nAnother test case: even number of elements.\n\nnumbers.txt:\n\n```\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n```\n\nSorted: [1,2,2,3,3,4]\n\nMedian should be (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5\n\nMode: 2 and 3 (both appear twice), but the code will pick the first one, which is 2.\n\nMean: (1+2+2+3+3+4)/6 = 15/6 = 2.5\n\nSo, output:\n\nMean: 2.50\n\nMedian: 2.50\n\nMode: 2\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAlright, I think the script is solid. I've handled reading the file, converting lines to numbers, calculating mean, median, and mode, and handling some edge cases.\n\nI can make it more robust by adding more error handling, like checking if the file is empty before reading lines, or handling cases where all numbers are the same.\n\nBut for now, this should suffice.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to read numbers from a text file, calculate the mean, median, and mode of these numbers, and then display the results. We will use Python's built-in functions and modules to achieve this efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading the File**: We will open the file and read the numbers into a list, converting them to floats to handle both integers and decimal numbers.\n2. **Calculating the Mean**: The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n3. **Calculating the Median**: We will sort the list of numbers and find the middle value. If there is an even number of elements, we will take the average of the two middle numbers.\n4. **Calculating the Mode**: We will use the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each number and determine the mode.\n5. **Error Handling**: We will handle cases where the file might not exist or contains non-numeric values.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport statistics\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        with open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n            lines = file.readlines()\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"Error: File not found.\")\n        return\n\n    numbers = []\n    for line in lines:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if line:\n            try:\n                num = float(line)\n                numbers.append(num)\n            except ValueError:\n                print(f\"Warning: '{line}' is not a valid number and will be ignored.\")\n    \n    if not numbers:\n        print(\"Error: No valid numbers found in the file.\")\n        return\n\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    median = statistics.median(numbers)\n    count = Counter(numbers)\n    max_freq = max(count.values())\n    mode = [num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == max_freq][0]\n\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Median: {median:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Mode: {mode}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the File**: We open the file `numbers.txt` and read all lines. Each line is stripped of extra whitespace and checked for non-emptiness.\n2. **Converting to Numbers**: Each line is attempted to be converted to a float. If successful, it is added to the `numbers` list. Any non-numeric lines are ignored with a warning message.\n3. **Calculating the Mean**: The mean is computed by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of numbers.\n4. **Calculating the Median**: We use the `statistics.median()` function to calculate the median, which handles both even and odd numbers of elements.\n5. **Calculating the Mode**: We use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each number and determine the mode by finding the number(s) with the highest frequency. We select the first one in case of multiple modes.\n6. **Error Handling**: We handle file not found errors and ensure that there are valid numbers in the file before performing calculations.\n\nThis approach ensures that the script is robust and can handle various edge cases effectively."
