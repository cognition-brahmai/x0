Let me think of a better one. \n\nWhy did Humpty Dumpty have a great fall? \n\nBecause he was Easter-egg-sited! \n\nHmm, maybe not the best. How about this: \n\nWhy did Jack and Jill go up the hill? \n\nTo fetch a pail of water, but they really just wanted to get away from the boring party down below! \n\nOkay, maybe that's a bit too modern for a nursery rhyme. Let's try another one. \n\nWhat did Cinderella say to the Prince after he proposed? \n\n\"Glass half full!\" \n\nOh, that's a bit cheesy. \n\nAlright, here's a classic: \n\nWhy was the straw so successful? \n\nBecause it was a little stem of a person! \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. \n\nLet me try again. \n\nWhy did the three bears get upset with Goldilocks? \n\nBecause she ate their porridge without paying! \n\nOh, maybe that's a bit harsh. \n\nHow about this: \n\nWhy did the itsy bitsy spider go up the water spout? \n\nTo get to the itsy bitsy roof! \n\nHmm, not very funny. \n\nLet me think of a different approach. \n\nWhat do you call a duck that's made of candy? \n\nA sweetie quacker! \n\nOkay, that's not a nursery rhyme, but it's a joke about a duck. \n\nWait, maybe I can combine them. \n\nWhy did Mary's lamb follow her to school? \n\nBecause it was made of foll-ow-ium! \n\nOkay, that's really stretching it. \n\nMaybe I should give up and admit that I'm not very good at jokes. \n\nBut since you asked for a nursery rhyme joke, I'll try one last time. \n\nWhy did Jack and Jill go back up the hill? \n\nTo retrieve the pail they forgot the first time! \n\nI guess that's a simple pun. \n\nI hope you found at least one of them amusing."
