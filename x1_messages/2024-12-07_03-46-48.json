        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train traveling between two cities that are 200 miles apart. It takes 5 hours to go from City A to City B at an average speed of 40 mph, and then it comes back from City B to City A at an average speed of 60 mph. I need to find the train's average speed for the entire round trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, for a round trip, it would be the total distance of both journeys divided by the total time for both journeys.\n\nGiven that the distance between the two cities is 200 miles, the round trip distance would be 200 miles there plus 200 miles back, which is 400 miles in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the total time taken for the round trip. The time taken to go from City A to City B is given as 5 hours. For the return journey from City B to City A, the train travels at 60 mph. To find the time for this journey, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time from City B to City A = 200 miles / 60 mph = 10/3 hours, which is approximately 3.333 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time for the round trip is 5 hours + 10/3 hours. To add these, I'll convert 5 hours to 15/3 hours, so 15/3 + 10/3 = 25/3 hours.\n\nNow, the average speed for the round trip is total distance divided by total time:\n\nAverage speed = 400 miles / (25/3) hours\n\nTo divide by a fraction, I multiply by its reciprocal:\n\n400 miles * (3/25) hours^-1 = (400 * 3) / 25 = 1200 / 25 = 48 mph\n\nSo, the train's average speed for the entire round trip is 48 mph.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that when dealing with average speeds for round trips where the speeds are different, there's a formula for that. I think it's something like the harmonic mean of the two speeds. Let me check that.\n\nThe formula for the average speed of a round trip is:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2)\n\nWhere speed1 is the speed going to City B, and speed2 is the speed coming back to City A.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * 40 mph * 60 mph) / (40 mph + 60 mph) = (4800) / (100) = 48 mph\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like 48 mph is the correct average speed for the entire round trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
