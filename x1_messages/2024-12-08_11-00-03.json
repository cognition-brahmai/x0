        "content": "Sure! To create a SQL query that retrieves the top 10 highest-grossing movies from a database table, you'll need to assume that the table contains at least two columns: one for the movie title and another for the gross earnings. Let's assume the table is named `movies` and it has columns `title` and `gross`.\n\nHere's a basic SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT title, gross\nFROM movies\nORDER BY gross DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `SELECT title, gross`: This specifies that we want to retrieve the movie titles and their corresponding gross earnings.\n- `FROM movies`: This indicates the table from which to retrieve the data.\n- `ORDER BY gross DESC`: This sorts the results in descending order based on the gross earnings, so the highest-grossing movies appear first.\n- `LIMIT 10`: This limits the result set to the top 10 rows.\n\nIf your table has different column names or additional columns that you want to include, you can adjust the query accordingly. For example, if there is a `release_year` column and you want to include it in the results, the query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT title, release_year, gross\nFROM movies\nORDER BY gross DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis will include the release year of each movie in the result set.\n\nIf you have any specific requirements or if the table structure is different, please let me know, and I can adjust the query accordingly."
