        "content": "India is a linguistically diverse country with over 19,500 languages, dialects, and mother tongues. As a result, there isn't a single language that all Indians speak. However, there are two main languages that serve as lingua francas in India: Hindi and English.\n\nHindi is the most widely spoken language in India, with around 41% of the population speaking it as their first language. It is the official language of the Indian government and is widely used in government, education, and media.\n\nEnglish is also widely spoken in India, especially in urban areas, and is used as a second language by many Indians. It is also the language of business, technology, and higher education in India.\n\nAside from Hindi and English, there are many other regional languages spoken in India, including Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Malayalam, Kannada, and others. Each of these languages has its own dialects and variations, adding to the linguistic diversity of the country."
