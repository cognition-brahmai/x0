Implementing a basic calculator in Java that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations is a great way to understand how to handle user inputs and perform arithmetic operations in Java. We'll also include error handling to make sure the calculator can handle invalid inputs and prevent division by zero errors.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to creating this calculator:\n\n### Step 1: Setting Up the Calculator Class\n\nFirst, we need to create a Java class for our calculator. Let's name it `BasicCalculator`.\n\n```java\npublic class BasicCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Calculator logic will go here\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Getting User Input\n\nWe need to get input from the user for the two operands and the operation they want to perform. For simplicity, we'll use `Scanner` to read input from the console.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BasicCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter first number:\");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter second number:\");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %):\");\n        char operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n\n        // Calculator logic will go here\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Performing Calculations Based on Operator\n\nWe'll use a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the operator entered by the user.\n\n```java\ndouble result;\nswitch(operator) {\n    case '+':\n        result = num1 + num2;\n        break;\n    case '-':\n        result = num1 - num2;\n        break;\n    case '*':\n        result = num1 * num2;\n        break;\n    case '/':\n        if(num2 != 0) {\n            result = num1 / num2;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n            return;\n        }\n        break;\n    case '%':\n        if(num2 != 0) {\n            result = num1 % num2;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Error! Modulo by zero.\");\n            return;\n        }\n        break;\n    default:\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid operator!\");\n        return;\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n```\n\n### Step 4: Adding Error Handling\n\nWe've already added basic error handling for division by zero and modulo by zero. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the user enters invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values for numbers or invalid operators.\n\nTo handle invalid inputs, we can use try-catch blocks to catch `InputMismatchException` when reading numbers.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.InputMismatchException;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BasicCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        double num1, num2, result;\n        char operator;\n\n        try {\n            System.out.println(\"Enter first number:\");\n            num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n            System.out.println(\"Enter second number:\");\n            num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n            System.out.println(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %):\");\n            operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n\n            switch(operator) {\n                case '+':\n                    result = num1 + num2;\n                    break;\n                case '-':\n                    result = num1 - num2;\n                    break;\n                case '*':\n                    result = num1 * num2;\n                    break;\n                case '/':\n                    if(num2 != 0) {\n                        result = num1 / num2;\n                    } else {\n                        System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n                        return;\n                    }\n                    break;\n                case '%':\n                    if(num2 != 0) {\n                        result = num1 % num2;\n                    } else {\n                        System.out.println(\"Error! Modulo by zero.\");\n                        return;\n                    }\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid operator!\");\n                    return;\n            }\n\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid input! Please enter numeric values for numbers.\");\n        } finally {\n            scanner.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Getting Inputs:** We use `Scanner` to read the two numbers and the operator from the user.\n2. **Performing Operations:** Based on the operator, we perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n3. **Error Handling:** We handle division by zero and modulo by zero by checking if the second number is zero before performing the operation. We also use a try-catch block to handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values for the numbers.\n4. **Invalid Operator:** If the user enters an operator other than +, -, *, /, or %, we display an error message.\n\nThis basic calculator is a good starting point. You can expand upon this by adding more features, such as handling more complex expressions, supporting decimal numbers, or providing a graphical user interface."
