        "content": "So there are 20 red balls and 30 blue balls in a box, making a total of 50 balls. You're going to pick one ball, look at its color, put it back, and then pick another ball. You want to know the probability of first picking a red ball and then picking a blue ball.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Since you're replacing the ball after the first pick, the total number of balls remains the same for both picks. That means the probability of picking a red ball first and a blue ball second are independent events.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of picking a red ball on the first pick. There are 20 red balls out of 50 total balls, so the probability is 20/50, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNext, the probability of picking a blue ball on the second pick. There are 30 blue balls out of 50 total balls, so that's 30/50, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nSince these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities together to get the overall probability of both events happening in sequence.\n\nSo, (2/5) * (3/5) = 6/25.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red ball followed by a blue ball is 6/25.\n\nBut let's double-check that. Another way to look at it is to consider the total number of possible outcomes. Since you're picking with replacement, there are 50 options for the first pick and 50 for the second, making 2500 possible outcomes (50*50).\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick a red ball first and a blue ball second. There are 20 red balls and 30 blue balls, so 20*30 = 600 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes: 600/2500, which simplifies to 6/25.\n\nYeah, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe without replacement, but the question specifies replacement. Okay, no need to worry about that.\n\nSo, final answer: 6/25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{6}{25}} \\]"
