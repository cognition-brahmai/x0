        "content": "Marie Curie was a pioneering scientist, born in Poland and later becoming a French citizen. She was a physicist and chemist, not a biologist or mathematician as you mentioned. Curie is renowned for her groundbreaking research on radioactivity, a term she coined herself. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields: Physics and Chemistry.\n\nIn 1903, Curie shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity. Then, in 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium. Her work laid the foundation for the field of nuclear physics and had a profound impact on the development of X-rays in medicine.\n\nCurie's achievements were exceptional, considering the societal barriers she faced as a woman in the scientific community during her time. Her legacy continues to inspire scientists and researchers around the world."
