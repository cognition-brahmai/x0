So, I'll calculate 60% of 500,000.\n\nTo find 60% of 500,000, I can multiply 500,000 by 0.60.\n\n500,000 \u00d7 0.60 = 300,000\n\nSo, 300,000 people vote in the election.\n\nNow, out of these 300,000 voters, 70% support Candidate A. I need to find out how many votes Candidate A receives.\n\nTo find 70% of 300,000, I can multiply 300,000 by 0.70.\n\n300,000 \u00d7 0.70 = 210,000\n\nTherefore, Candidate A receives 210,000 votes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210000} \\]"
