        "content": "Sure! Here's a Python function that does exactly that:\n\n```python\ndef string_lengths(strings):\n    return {s: len(s) for s in strings}\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of strings to it, and it will return a dictionary with each string as a key and its length as the corresponding value. For example:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\"]\nresult = string_lengths(words)\nprint(result)  # Output: {'hello': 5, 'world': 5, 'python': 6}\n```\n\n## Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `string_lengths` is defined to accept one parameter, `strings`, which is expected to be a list of strings.\n- **Dictionary Comprehension**: Inside the function, a dictionary comprehension is used to iterate over each string in the list and create key-value pairs where the key is the string itself and the value is the length of that string obtained using the `len()` function.\n- **Return Statement**: The function returns the resulting dictionary.\n\nThis approach is efficient and concise, making use of Python's powerful dictionary comprehension feature to achieve the desired outcome in a single line of code."
