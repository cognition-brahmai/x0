An exoplanet in the habitable zone C. A pulsar D. A nebula.\" Okay, so I need to figure out which one of these probably has a solid surface. Let's recall what each of these is.\n\nFirst, a red giant star. I know that stars are big balls of gas that produce energy through nuclear fusion. They're made mostly of hydrogen and helium. A red giant is a stage in a star's life when it expands and cools down, becoming redder. So, it's still a big ball of gas, right? Probably not solid. So, maybe A isn't the answer.\n\nNext, an exoplanet in the habitable zone. Exoplanets are planets outside our solar system, and the habitable zone is the area around a star where conditions might be right for liquid water to exist on the surface. So, if it's in the habitable zone, it might have a solid surface, like Earth, where water can be liquid. That seems promising.\n\nThen, there's a pulsar. I think pulsars are neutron stars, which are the collapsed cores of massive stars after a supernova explosion. They're extremely dense, with a lot of mass packed into a small space. I'm not sure if they have a solid surface or not. Maybe they have a solid crust, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLastly, a nebula. Nebulas are clouds of gas and dust in space where stars are born or where stars have died and ejected their material. They're just clouds, so probably not solid.\n\nComparing these options, the exoplanet in the habitable zone seems like the most likely to have a solid surface, especially since it's in an area where conditions might allow for liquid water, which typically requires a solid surface to accumulate on.\n\nBut let me double-check. Red giant stars are still gaseous, pulsars are neutron stars with extremely high densities, and nebulas are just clouds of gas and dust. So, yeah, an exoplanet in the habitable zone is probably the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n"
