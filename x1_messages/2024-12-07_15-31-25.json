        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the office building uses 20 packs of paper every week, and each pack contains 500 sheets. We need to find out how many sheets are used in a year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many sheets are used each week. Since each pack has 500 sheets and they use 20 packs per week, I can multiply those two numbers to get the weekly usage.\n\nSo, 20 packs/week \u00d7 500 sheets/pack = 10,000 sheets/week.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many weeks there are in a year. Typically, there are 52 weeks in a year.\n\nNow, to find the annual usage, I can multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a year.\n\nSo, 10,000 sheets/week \u00d7 52 weeks/year = 520,000 sheets/year.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there might be any other factors to consider. For example, is there any paper usage beyond the regular weekly consumption? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so I'll assume that the weekly usage is consistent throughout the year.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any leap years or extra weeks, but since the problem specifies \"in a year\" without any additional details, I'll stick with the standard 52 weeks.\n\nSo, my final answer is 520,000 sheets of paper per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{520000} \\]"
