First, I need to find out the average water usage per person per day, and then multiply that by the average number of people in a household.\n\nThe question says that each person uses about 80-100 gallons per day. That's a range, so maybe I should find the average of that range to get a single value. Let's see, 80 plus 100 is 180, and divided by 2 that's 90 gallons per person per day. So, on average, each person uses 90 gallons per day.\n\nNext, the average number of people per household is 2.53. So, to find the total water usage per household per day, I need to multiply the average usage per person by the average number of people per household.\n\nThat would be 90 gallons/person/day times 2.53 persons/household.\n\nLet me do the math: 90 multiplied by 2.53.\n\nFirst, 90 times 2 is 180.\n\nThen, 90 times 0.5 is 45.\n\nAnd 90 times 0.03 is 2.7.\n\nSo, adding those up: 180 plus 45 is 225, plus 2.7 is 227.7 gallons per household per day.\n\nWait a minute, but the question mentions a range of 80-100 gallons per person per day. Maybe I should calculate the range for household usage as well.\n\nIf each person uses 80 gallons per day, then for 2.53 people, it would be 80 times 2.53.\n\n80 times 2 is 160.\n\n80 times 0.5 is 40.\n\n80 times 0.03 is 2.4.\n\nSo, 160 plus 40 is 200, plus 2.4 is 202.4 gallons.\n\nSimilarly, if each person uses 100 gallons per day, then 100 times 2.53.\n\n100 times 2 is 200.\n\n100 times 0.5 is 50.\n\n100 times 0.03 is 3.\n\nSo, 200 plus 50 is 250, plus 3 is 253 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the average household water usage per day would be between 202.4 and 253 gallons, with an average of around 227.7 gallons based on the per person average of 90 gallons.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if using the average of 90 gallons per person is the best approach. Maybe I should consider that the usage per person varies between 80 and 100 gallons, and the number of people per household is also an average.\n\nPerhaps a more accurate way is to consider that the total usage per household is the number of people in the household times the usage per person, and since both are variables, I need to find the expected value.\n\nLet me think about this statistically. The expected value of the total usage (E[T]) is the product of the expected number of people per household (E[N]) and the expected usage per person (E[U]).\n\nGiven that E[N] = 2.53 and E[U] = 90 gallons, then E[T] = E[N] * E[U] = 2.53 * 90 = 227.7 gallons, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the range, the minimum usage would be 80 gallons per person times 2.53 people, which is 202.4 gallons, and the maximum would be 100 gallons per person times 2.53 people, which is 253 gallons.\n\nSo, the average household usage per day is approximately 227.7 gallons, with a range of 202.4 to 253 gallons based on individual usage.\n\nBut, I'm wondering if there's a more precise way to calculate this, perhaps considering the distribution of the number of people in a household and the distribution of water usage per person.\n\nHowever, since the question provides average values and a range, I think the approach I've taken is sufficient for an estimate.\n\nIt's also worth noting that water usage can vary significantly based on various factors such as climate, household habits, appliances used, and whether the household has a lawn or garden that requires watering.\n\nMoreover, the average number of people per household might not be uniformly distributed; there are households with one, two, three, or more people, and the actual distribution could affect the total usage.\n\nBut, with the information given, I think calculating the average usage per household as 227.7 gallons per day is a reasonable estimate.\n\nSo, to answer the question: An average American household uses approximately 227.7 gallons of water per day, with a range between 202.4 and 253 gallons per day, based on individual usage of 80-100 gallons per person per day and an average of 2.53 people per household.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{227.7} \\]"
