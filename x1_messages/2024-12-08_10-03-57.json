        "content": "Yes, some people are born with joints that are more flexible than usual. This condition is often referred to as being \"double-jointed,\" but the medical term for it is joint hypermobility. People with hypermobile joints can move their limbs beyond the normal range of motion. It's important to note that while hypermobility can be a sign of flexibility and may even be beneficial in certain activities like dancing or gymnastics, it can also lead to joint instability and an increased risk of injuries if not managed properly. If someone has hypermobile joints, it's advisable for them to engage in activities that strengthen the muscles around the joints to provide better support and stability.\n"
