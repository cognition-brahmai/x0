        "content": "A saxophone is classified as a woodwind instrument, even though it's made of metal. It's part of the woodwind family because of the way it's played, using a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of a clarinet. The saxophone was invented by Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s and is used in a variety of musical genres, including classical, jazz, and popular music.\n"
