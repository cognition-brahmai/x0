        "content": "So there are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 10 balls. I take one ball out at random, look at its color, and put it back in the bag. Then I take out another ball at random. I need to find the probability that both balls I took out were red.\n\nOkay, so since I'm putting the first ball back into the bag before drawing the second ball, that means the total number of balls remains the same for both draws, right? So, each draw is independent of the other.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw. There are 4 red balls out of 10 total balls, so the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, since I'm putting the ball back, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is the same, 2/5.\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen\u2014drawing a red ball first AND drawing a red ball second\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, probability of both balls being red = (probability of first ball being red) \u00d7 (probability of second ball being red) = (2/5) \u00d7 (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nWait, but I should double-check this. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the total possible outcomes. Since each draw is independent and there are 10 balls each time, there are 10 possibilities for the first draw and 10 for the second, making 10 \u00d7 10 = 100 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to draw a red ball both times. There are 4 red balls, so there are 4 choices for the first draw and 4 choices for the second draw, making 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 16/100, which simplifies to 4/25.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says \"take out one ball at random, look at its color, and put it back in the bag.\" So, replacement is definitely happening here.\n\nIf there was no replacement, meaning I don't put the first ball back, then the total number of balls would change for the second draw, and the probabilities would be different. But in this case, it's with replacement.\n\nIs there any chance that the balls are not equally likely to be drawn? The problem doesn't specify anything like that, so I'm assuming each ball has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\nAlso, the fact that I look at the color shouldn't affect the probability, as it's just observation and doesn't change the physical setup.\n\nSo, I think 4/25 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's consider the general formula for probability with replacement.\n\nIf you have two independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHere, drawing the first red ball and drawing the second red ball are independent events since the ball is replaced each time.\n\nTherefore, P(both red) = P(first red) \u00d7 P(second red) = (4/10) \u00d7 (4/10) = 16/100 = 4/25.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. So, the probability that both balls taken out were red is 4/25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}} \\]"
