That sounds like a lot of fun! It seems like you have a vibrant imagination and enjoy expressing yourself through movement. Is there a particular type of dance you enjoy or a style that makes you feel especially alive? Maybe you can describe one of your favorite dancing experiences or what it feels like to lose yourself in the rhythm. I'm all ears (or should I say, all eyes for your dance moves)!"
