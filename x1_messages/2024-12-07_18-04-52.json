        "content": "So I've got this problem about a shipping company and their cargo ships. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the annual revenue generated by a single ship. Here's what we know:\n\n- Each ship has a carrying capacity of 50,000 tons.\n\n- It takes an average of 15 days to complete a round trip.\n\n- The company charges $5 per ton of cargo transported.\n\n- The ship operates at full capacity and completes 20 round trips per year.\n\nOkay, so to find the annual revenue, I think we need to calculate the total amount of cargo transported in a year and then multiply that by the charge per ton.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much cargo is transported in one round trip. Since the ship operates at full capacity, it carries 50,000 tons per trip.\n\nNow, if it completes 20 round trips in a year, the total cargo transported in a year would be:\n\n50,000 tons/trip \u00d7 20 trips/year = 1,000,000 tons/year\n\nNext, the revenue is calculated by multiplying the total cargo by the charge per ton:\n\n1,000,000 tons/year \u00d7 $5/ton = $5,000,000/year\n\nSo, the annual revenue generated by a single ship is $5,000,000.\n\nNow, the second part of the question asks about the effect on revenue if the company increases its carrying capacity by 10% or reduces the average round-trip time by 2 days.\n\nLet's consider each scenario separately.\n\nFirst, increasing the carrying capacity by 10%.\n\nIf the original capacity is 50,000 tons, a 10% increase would be:\n\n50,000 tons \u00d7 0.10 = 5,000 tons\n\nSo, the new capacity would be:\n\n50,000 tons + 5,000 tons = 55,000 tons\n\nAssuming the number of round trips remains the same at 20 per year, the new total cargo transported would be:\n\n55,000 tons/trip \u00d7 20 trips/year = 1,100,000 tons/year\n\nAnd the new revenue would be:\n\n1,100,000 tons/year \u00d7 $5/ton = $5,500,000/year\n\nSo, the increase in revenue from increasing capacity by 10% would be:\n\n$5,500,000 - $5,000,000 = $500,000/year\n\nAlternatively, if the company reduces the average round-trip time by 2 days, from 15 days to 13 days, we need to see how that affects the number of round trips in a year.\n\nFirst, find out how many round trips can be completed in a year with the reduced trip time.\n\nThere are 365 days in a year.\n\nOriginal round-trip time: 15 days\n\nNumber of trips per year: 365 / 15 \u2248 24.33 trips\n\nBut the problem states it's 20 trips per year. Hmm, maybe there's a reason for that, like maintenance or other factors. But to follow the problem's initial condition, I'll assume that at 15 days per trip, it's 20 trips per year.\n\nSo, if the round-trip time is reduced by 2 days to 13 days, the new number of trips per year would be:\n\n365 / 13 \u2248 28.08 trips/year\n\nAgain, assuming the ship operates at full capacity, the new total cargo transported would be:\n\n50,000 tons/trip \u00d7 28 trips/year = 1,400,000 tons/year\n\nAnd the new revenue would be:\n\n1,400,000 tons/year \u00d7 $5/ton = $7,000,000/year\n\nSo, the increase in revenue from reducing the round-trip time by 2 days would be:\n\n$7,000,000 - $5,000,000 = $2,000,000/year\n\nWait a minute, that seems significant. Maybe I need to double-check my assumptions here.\n\nThe problem states that the ship completes 20 round trips per year with a 15-day round trip time. But according to my calculation, 365 days / 15 days/trip \u2248 24.33 trips/year. So why is it said to be 20 trips per year? Maybe there are other factors like loading and unloading times, maintenance, etc., that are reducing the number of possible trips to 20.\n\nIf that's the case, then reducing the round-trip time to 13 days might not necessarily increase the number of trips to 28 per year, because those other factors might still apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 20 trips per year is a given condition, regardless of the round-trip time. But that doesn't make much sense because the round-trip time directly affects how many trips can be made in a year.\n\nI think I need to stick with the initial condition that at 15 days per trip, the ship makes 20 trips per year. So, if the round-trip time is reduced to 13 days, I need to find out how many trips can be made in a year, given that the original number of trips was 20 for 15-day trips.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of trips is directly proportional to the number of days in a year divided by the round-trip time.\n\nSo, if original round-trip time is 15 days, and number of trips is 20, then:\n\nNumber of trips per year = 365 / round-trip time\n\nSo, 365 / 15 \u2248 24.33, but the problem says 20 trips. Maybe there are 4.33 trips that are not completed due to other constraints.\n\nIf that's the case, then reducing the round-trip time to 13 days would allow for 365 / 13 \u2248 28.08 trips, but perhaps only a certain number of trips can be actually made due to those constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 20 trips per year is a fixed operational parameter, and the round-trip time is just a characteristic of the operation.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's assume that the number of trips per year is inversely proportional to the round-trip time.\n\nSo, if the round-trip time decreases by a certain proportion, the number of trips increases by the same proportion.\n\nOriginal round-trip time: 15 days\n\nNew round-trip time: 13 days\n\nRatio: 13 / 15 = 0.8667\n\nSo, the new number of trips would be: 20 / 0.8667 \u2248 23.08 trips/year\n\nThen, the new total cargo transported would be:\n\n50,000 tons/trip \u00d7 23.08 trips/year \u2248 1,154,000 tons/year\n\nAnd the new revenue would be:\n\n1,154,000 tons/year \u00d7 $5/ton = $5,770,000/year\n\nSo, the increase in revenue from reducing the round-trip time by 2 days would be:\n\n$5,770,000 - $5,000,000 = $770,000/year\n\nThis seems more reasonable compared to my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Original annual revenue: $5,000,000\n\n- Increase in revenue from 10% capacity increase: $500,000\n\n- Increase in revenue from 2-day reduction in round-trip time: $770,000\n\nTherefore, reducing the round-trip time by 2 days has a larger impact on revenue compared to increasing capacity by 10%.\n\nAlternatively, if both changes are implemented together, the new capacity would be 55,000 tons per trip, and the new number of trips would be approximately 23.08 per year.\n\nSo, total cargo transported would be:\n\n55,000 tons/trip \u00d7 23.08 trips/year \u2248 1,269,400 tons/year\n\nAnd revenue would be:\n\n1,269,400 tons/year \u00d7 $5/ton = $6,347,000/year\n\nWhich is an increase of:\n\n$6,347,000 - $5,000,000 = $1,347,000/year\n\nSo, combining both improvements would have a greater effect on revenue than each change individually.\n\nThis makes sense because both increasing capacity and reducing trip time directly contribute to higher cargo transportation and thus higher revenue.\n\nIt's important to note that these calculations assume that the ship can always operate at full capacity and that there is sufficient demand for the additional cargo transport. In reality, there might be constraints such as port capacities, market demand, or regulatory limitations that could affect these projections.\n\nAlso, increasing capacity or reducing trip times may have associated costs, such as higher fuel consumption, increased maintenance, or higher investment in faster ships. These costs would need to be considered to determine the net profit from these changes, not just the revenue.\n\nBut based on the information provided and focusing solely on revenue, the calculations above should give a good estimate of the potential impact of these changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5000000 \\text{ dollars per year}} \\]"
