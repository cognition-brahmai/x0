        "content": "So I need to calculate the surface area of a sphere that has a radius of 6 centimeters. I remember there's a formula for this, but I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the surface area of a sphere. I think it involves the radius and pi. Hmm, I believe the formula is A equals 4 times pi times the radius squared. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm that. Yes, after checking, the formula for the surface area A of a sphere is indeed:\n\nA = 4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nOkay, so in this case, the radius r is 6 centimeters. So, I need to plug that value into the formula.\n\nFirst, I'll square the radius:\n\nr\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36 cm\u00b2\n\nNext, I'll multiply that by \u03c0. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, but since the problem didn't specify the level of precision, I'll use 3.14 for simplicity.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c0 * r\u00b2 = 3.14 * 36 = 113.04 cm\u00b2\n\nThen, I need to multiply that result by 4:\n\nA = 4 * 113.04 = 452.16 cm\u00b2\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I'd better double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recalculate step by step.\n\nFirst, squaring the radius:\n\n6 * 6 = 36 cm\u00b2\n\nAlright, that's correct.\n\nNext, multiplying by \u03c0. If \u03c0 is approximately 3.14, then:\n\n3.14 * 36 = 113.04 cm\u00b2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 4:\n\n4 * 113.04 = 452.16 cm\u00b2\n\nThat seems right. But maybe I should verify this formula again. I don't want to confuse it with the formula for the volume of a sphere.\n\nLet me recall: the volume V of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, whereas the surface area A is 4\u03c0r\u00b2. So, I have the right formula for surface area.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the surface area of a sphere. I've heard that the surface area of a sphere is equal to the area of four circles with the same radius as the sphere. That is, A = 4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2. That makes sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about integration, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nSo, sticking with the formula A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, and plugging in r = 6 cm, I get A = 4 * 3.14 * 36 = 452.16 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider more decimal places for \u03c0 to increase accuracy. Let's see, if I use \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416,\n\nThen,\n\n\u03c0 * r\u00b2 = 3.1416 * 36 = 113.1056 cm\u00b2\n\nThen,\n\nA = 4 * 113.1056 = 452.4224 cm\u00b2\n\nThat's a slight difference. If I use \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535,\n\nThen,\n\n\u03c0 * r\u00b2 = 3.1415926535 * 36 \u2248 113.0973 cm\u00b2\n\nThen,\n\nA = 4 * 113.0973 \u2248 452.3893 cm\u00b2\n\nSo, depending on the precision of \u03c0, I get slightly different results. But for most practical purposes, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.14 is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I leave \u03c0 as is, without approximating, the surface area would be:\n\nA = 4 * \u03c0 * 36 = 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nThat's another way to express the answer, especially if the problem doesn't specify to use a decimal approximation for \u03c0.\n\nBut since the radius is given in centimeters with no specified level of precision, I'll go with A \u2248 452.16 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's a more exact way to express this. Maybe I should leave it in terms of \u03c0, as 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nThat might be more precise and mathematically elegant.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a numerical value, then 452.16 cm\u00b2 is acceptable.\n\nLet me see: the radius is given as 6 cm, which is a precise value, so perhaps leaving the answer in terms of \u03c0 is better.\n\nOn the other hand, if I need to report the surface area as a numerical value, then using \u03c0 \u2248 3.14 is standard.\n\nAlternatively, if higher precision is required, I could use a more accurate value of \u03c0.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with \u03c0 \u2248 3.14, giving A \u2248 452.16 cm\u00b2.\n\nOne more thing: I should ensure that the units are correct. Since the radius is in centimeters, the surface area should be in square centimeters, which it is.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't miss any steps in the calculation. Let's review:\n\n1. Identify the formula: A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\n2. Plug in r = 6 cm: A = 4 * \u03c0 * (6 cm)\u00b2\n\n3. Calculate r\u00b2: 6 cm * 6 cm = 36 cm\u00b2\n\n4. Multiply by \u03c0: 3.14 * 36 cm\u00b2 = 113.04 cm\u00b2\n\n5. Multiply by 4: 4 * 113.04 cm\u00b2 = 452.16 cm\u00b2\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the exact value:\n\nA = 4\u03c0(6)^2 = 4\u03c0(36) = 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nThat's also correct.\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is either 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2 or approximately 452.16 cm\u00b2.\n\nI think that covers it. If there's anything else I should consider, I'll have to think about it.\n\nWait, maybe I should confirm if there are any other formulas or methods to calculate the surface area of a sphere. For example, perhaps there's a way to derive the formula using calculus, but that might not be necessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the ratio of the surface area to the radius squared, but that seems unnecessarily complicated.\n\nI think sticking with the standard formula is the way to go.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 6 centimeters is 144\u03c0 square centimeters, or approximately 452.16 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144\\pi \\text{ cm}^2 \\approx 452.16 \\text{ cm}^2} \\]"
