        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. The mayor planned to paint even-numbered houses blue and odd-numbered houses red. But there was a mistake, and house number 50 was painted red instead of blue. I need to find out how many houses are actually painted blue.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many houses are supposed to be painted blue. Since even-numbered houses are supposed to be blue, I need to count the even numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nEven numbers are every second number, so from 1 to 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, up to 100. To find out how many there are, I can divide 100 by 2, which gives 50. So, there are 50 even-numbered houses, meaning 50 houses are supposed to be painted blue.\n\nBut there was a mistake, and house number 50 was painted red instead of blue. So, one house that was supposed to be blue is now painted red. Therefore, the number of houses painted blue should be one less than the original 50.\n\nSo, 50 minus 1 equals 49 houses painted blue.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other house that might have been affected by this mistake? The problem says only house number 50 was painted red instead of blue, so I think only that one house is incorrectly painted.\n\nTherefore, the total number of houses painted blue is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]"
