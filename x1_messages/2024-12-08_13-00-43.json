        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car depreciating in value. It says that the car depreciates at a rate of 15% per year, and its initial value is $25,000. I need to find out what its value will be after 4 years. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what depreciation means. Depreciation is when something loses value over time. In this case, it's a car losing value each year at a rate of 15%. So, every year, the car is worth 15% less than it was the previous year.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the value after 4 years. I think the best way to do this is to use the formula for exponential decay, because depreciation is similar to exponential decay.\n\nThe general formula for exponential decay is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Value} = \\text{Initial Value} \\times (1 - \\text{rate})^{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nIn this formula:\n\n- Initial Value is the starting value, which is $25,000.\n\n- Rate is the depreciation rate, which is 15% per year. I need to convert this percentage into a decimal. 15% is the same as 0.15.\n\n- Time is the number of years, which is 4.\n\nSo, plugging in these values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Value} = 25000 \\times (1 - 0.15)^4 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 1 - 0.15 \\):\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \\]\n\nSo, the formula now becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Value} = 25000 \\times (0.85)^4 \\]\n\nNext, I need to calculate \\( 0.85 \\) raised to the power of 4. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( 0.85^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.85 \\times 0.85 = 0.7225 \\]\n\nThen, \\( 0.85^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.7225 \\times 0.85 = 0.614125 \\]\n\nFinally, \\( 0.85^4 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.614125 \\times 0.85 = 0.52195625 \\]\n\nSo, now the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Value} = 25000 \\times 0.52195625 \\]\n\nNow, multiply 25000 by 0.52195625:\n\n\\[ 25000 \\times 0.52195625 = 13048.90625 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the car after 4 years will be approximately $13,048.91.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Value} = 25000 \\times (0.85)^4 \\]\n\nI calculated \\( 0.85^4 = 0.52195625 \\), and then multiplied by 25000 to get 13048.90625.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a different approach to verify this result. Maybe calculate the depreciation each year step by step.\n\nYear 0: Initial value = $25,000\n\nYear 1: Depreciates by 15%, so value = 25000 - (0.15 \u00d7 25000) = 25000 - 3750 = 21,250\n\nYear 2: Depreciates by 15% of 21,250 = 21,250 - (0.15 \u00d7 21,250) = 21,250 - 3,187.50 = 18,062.50\n\nYear 3: Depreciates by 15% of 18,062.50 = 18,062.50 - (0.15 \u00d7 18,062.50) = 18,062.50 - 2,709.375 = 15,353.125\n\nYear 4: Depreciates by 15% of 15,353.125 = 15,353.125 - (0.15 \u00d7 15,353.125) = 15,353.125 - 2,302.96875 = 13,050.15625\n\nSo, using this step-by-step method, the value after 4 years is approximately $13,050.16, which is very close to the earlier calculation of $13,048.91. The slight difference might be due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the car after 4 years will be around $13,050.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for exponential decay again to confirm:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Value} = 25000 \\times (0.85)^4 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 0.85^4 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.85^2 = 0.7225 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.7225 \\times 0.85 = 0.614125 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.614125 \\times 0.85 = 0.52195625 \\]\n\nThen, \\( 25000 \\times 0.52195625 = 13048.90625 \\), which is approximately $13,048.91.\n\nGiven the slight discrepancy between the two methods ($13,048.91 vs $13,050.16), I think it's reasonable to round to the nearest dollar or cent, depending on the required precision.\n\nProbably, the more accurate value is $13,050.16, considering the step-by-step calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately $13,050.16.\n\nBut to be precise, considering the exponential decay formula, it's $13,048.91.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check if there's a better way to calculate this to ensure accuracy.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for compound depreciation, which is similar to compound interest but in reverse.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Value} = \\text{Initial Value} \\times (1 - \\text{depreciation rate})^{\\text{number of periods}} \\]\n\nWhich is exactly the formula I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, some people might use the straight-line depreciation method, where the value decreases by a fixed amount each year.\n\nBut in this case, since it's specified as a percentage rate per year, it's more appropriate to use the exponential decay formula.\n\nAlternatively, if it were straight-line depreciation, the depreciation per year would be 15% of the initial value, which is 0.15 \u00d7 25000 = $3,750 per year.\n\nThen, over 4 years, the total depreciation would be 4 \u00d7 $3,750 = $15,000.\n\nSubtracting that from the initial value: 25,000 - 15,000 = $10,000.\n\nBut this method doesn't account for the fact that depreciation is applied to the decreasing value each year, not the initial value.\n\nSo, the exponential decay method is more accurate in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the value after 4 years is approximately $13,050.\n\nWait, but earlier I got two slightly different values: $13,048.91 and $13,050.16.\n\nI think the discrepancy is due to rounding errors in the step-by-step method.\n\nIn the exponential decay formula, the exact value is $13,048.90625, which rounds to $13,048.91.\n\nIn the step-by-step method, I got $13,050.15625, which rounds to $13,050.16.\n\nThe difference is $1.25, which is likely due to rounding at each step.\n\nTherefore, the more accurate value is $13,048.91, as calculated by the exponential decay formula.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately $13,048.91.\n\nBut for financial calculations, it's standard to round to two decimal places, so $13,048.91 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem doesn't specify, you could round to the nearest dollar, which would be $13,049.\n\nBut to be precise, $13,048.91 is the correct value.\n\nSo, to summarize, the car's value after 4 years of depreciating at 15% per year from an initial value of $25,000 is approximately $13,048.91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13048.91} \\]"
