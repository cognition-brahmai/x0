        "content": "So, the company has 120 employees, and each one works 40 hours per week. That makes sense. Now, they're planning to increase their workforce by 25%. I need to find out how many additional hours will be worked weekly because of this increase.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many new employees are being added. A 25% increase on 120 employees. To calculate that, I can multiply 120 by 25% or 0.25.\n\nSo, 120 times 0.25 equals 30. That means 30 new employees are being added.\n\nNow, each new employee works the same amount as the existing ones, which is 40 hours per week. So, to find the additional hours worked weekly, I can multiply the number of new employees by the hours each one works.\n\nThat would be 30 times 40, which equals 1200 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The company had 120 employees at 40 hours each, so total hours were 120 times 40, which is 4800 hours per week.\n\nAfter the increase, there are 120 plus 30 equals 150 employees. So, 150 times 40 equals 6000 hours per week.\n\nThe difference between the new total and the old total is 6000 minus 4800, which is also 1200 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the additional hours worked weekly are 1200 hours.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe there's a formula or a different approach that could confirm this.\n\nAnother way is to consider that a 25% increase in workforce would directly translate to a 25% increase in hours worked, assuming each new employee works the same number of hours as existing ones.\n\nSo, the original total hours are 4800 per week. Increasing that by 25% would be 4800 times 0.25, which is again 1200 hours.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, regardless of whether I calculate the number of new employees and then their total hours, or I calculate a 25% increase on the total hours, I end up with the same number: 1200 additional hours per week.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nFor example, are there any part-time employees, or do the new employees work different hours? The question says each employee works 40 hours per week, and the new employees are presumably on the same schedule.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"additional hours worked weekly,\" which seems to be straightforward.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here. It's a straightforward percentage increase applied to the workforce, with each new employee working the same hours as existing ones.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1200 additional hours worked weekly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
