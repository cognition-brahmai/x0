        "content": "So there are 15 students in the classroom, and each student has 3 pencils and 2 pens. I need to find out the total number of writing instruments all the students have together.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a writing instrument is. In this context, it seems to include both pencils and pens, since both are used for writing.\n\nSo, each student has:\n\n- 3 pencils\n\n- 2 pens\n\nThat means each student has a total of 3 + 2 = 5 writing instruments.\n\nNow, there are 15 students, and each has 5 writing instruments. To find the total, I need to multiply the number of students by the number of writing instruments per student.\n\nTotal writing instruments = number of students \u00d7 writing instruments per student\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal writing instruments = 15 \u00d7 5\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n15 \u00d7 5 is 75.\n\nSo, all the students have 75 writing instruments in total.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that I haven't missed anything. Let's see:\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the total number of pencils and the total number of pens separately, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, total pencils:\n\nEach student has 3 pencils, and there are 15 students.\n\nTotal pencils = 15 \u00d7 3 = 45 pencils.\n\nNext, total pens:\n\nEach student has 2 pens, and there are 15 students.\n\nTotal pens = 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 pens.\n\nNow, total writing instruments = total pencils + total pens = 45 + 30 = 75.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider if there are any other writing instruments, but according to the problem, only pencils and pens are mentioned.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that all students have the same number of pencils and pens. The problem states that each student has 3 pencils and 2 pens, so it's consistent across all students.\n\nTherefore, the total number of writing instruments is indeed 75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
