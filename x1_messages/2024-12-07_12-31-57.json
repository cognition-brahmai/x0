It seems like a riddle, and I think the answer might be related to the amount of money given to the sons.\n\nSo, one son is given 10 cents and the other is given 15 cents. The question is, \"What time is it?\" Hmm, maybe the amounts represent something on a clock.\n\nLet me think about this. On a clock, each hour is divided into 60 minutes, and each minute is divided into 60 seconds. But I don't see an immediate connection here.\n\nWait, perhaps the cents represent the positions of the hour and minute hands on an analog clock. For example, 10 cents could correspond to 10 minutes, and 15 cents to 15 minutes. But that doesn't seem to make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a play on words. Like, \"a quarter to\" something. Since 15 cents is a quarter, and 10 cents is a dime. But again, I'm not sure how to connect these to tell the time.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the amounts given to the sons are clues to a specific time of day. For instance, perhaps the time is 1:15, where 1 hour and 15 minutes have passed.\n\nWait, or maybe it's 1:25, with one son getting 10 cents and the other 15 cents, totaling 25 cents. But I'm just guessing here.\n\nI think I need more information to solve this riddle. Perhaps you can provide some context or hints?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1:25} \\]"
