        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We start with 5 spies in a room, each known only by their alias. So, everyone in the room is under some pseudonym, and no one knows their real names, right?\n\nNow, one of these spies reveals his true identity. What does this mean? Well, he's telling others his real name, which means he's no longer maintaining the secrecy that comes with being a spy. In the context of this problem, revealing his true identity causes him to lose his status as a spy.\n\nSo, the question is, how many spies are left in the room after this revelation?\n\nLet's think about this carefully. Initially, there are 5 spies. One of them reveals his true identity and loses his spy status. So, it seems like there should be 4 spies left.\n\nBut wait a minute. The problem says that the spy who revealed his identity loses his status as a spy. Does that mean he's no longer considered a spy in the room?\n\nYes, that's what it seems. So, if one spy loses his status, then there should be 4 spies remaining.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any other implication. For example, does revealing his true identity affect the status of the other spies? Probably not, since only the one who revealed his identity loses his status.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that spies are known by their aliases only. So, when one reveals his true identity, does that mean others can now identify him by his real name? Maybe, but the problem seems to focus on the status change of the spy who revealed his identity.\n\nFurthermore, the problem specifies that by revealing his true identity, he loses his status as a spy. It doesn't say anything about the others, so we can assume the other four still maintain their spy status as they haven't done anything to lose it.\n\nTherefore, the number of spies left in the room should be 4.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any trick or twist in this problem.
