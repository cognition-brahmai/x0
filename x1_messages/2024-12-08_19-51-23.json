        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. I need to find out the probability that all 5 cards drawn from a standard deck of 52 playing cards are hearts, and it's without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, and among them, there are 13 hearts. So, the total number of ways to draw 5 cards from 52 without regard to order is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of possible 5-card hands is \\( C(52, 5) \\).\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, which are the hands where all 5 cards are hearts. Since there are 13 hearts, the number of ways to choose 5 hearts from 13 is \\( C(13, 5) \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability \\( P \\) that all 5 cards are hearts should be the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, which is \\( P = \\frac{C(13, 5)}{C(52, 5)} \\).\n\nLet me calculate \\( C(52, 5) \\) and \\( C(13, 5) \\).\n\nFirst, \\( C(52, 5) = \\frac{52!}{5!(52 - 5)!} = \\frac{52!}{5! \\cdot 47!} \\). I don't need to compute the full factorials; I can simplify this by canceling out the 47! in the numerator and denominator. So, \\( C(52, 5) = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\).\n\nCalculating the numerator: \\( 52 \\times 51 = 2652 \\), \\( 2652 \\times 50 = 132600 \\), \\( 132600 \\times 49 = 6507400 \\), \\( 6507400 \\times 48 = 312355200 \\).\n\nNow, the denominator: \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\), \\( 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\), \\( 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\), \\( 120 \\times 1 = 120 \\).\n\nSo, \\( C(52, 5) = \\frac{312355200}{120} = 2600260 \\).\n\nNext, \\( C(13, 5) = \\frac{13!}{5!(13 - 5)!} = \\frac{13!}{5! \\cdot 8!} \\). Again, simplifying by canceling out the 8!:\n\n\\( C(13, 5) = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\).\n\nNumerator: \\( 13 \\times 12 = 156 \\), \\( 156 \\times 11 = 1716 \\), \\( 1716 \\times 10 = 17160 \\), \\( 17160 \\times 9 = 154440 \\).\n\nDenominator is still 120.\n\nSo, \\( C(13, 5) = \\frac{154440}{120} = 1287 \\).\n\nNow, the probability \\( P = \\frac{1287}{2600260} \\).\n\nI can simplify this fraction. Let's see if 1287 and 2600260 have any common factors.\n\nFirst, check if 1287 is divisible by small primes:\n\nDoes 1287 divide by 3? Well, 1 + 2 + 8 + 7 = 18, which is divisible by 3. So, 1287 \u00f7 3 = 429.\n\nNow, 429: 4 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3. So, 429 \u00f7 3 = 143.\n\n143: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8, not divisible by 3. Check for 11: 1 - 4 + 3 = 0, which is divisible by 11. So, 143 \u00f7 11 = 13.\n\nSo, 1287 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13.\n\nNow, check 2600260:\n\nDivisible by 2? Yes, last digit is 0. So, 2600260 \u00f7 2 = 1300130.\n\nAgain, divisible by 2: 1300130 \u00f7 2 = 650065.\n\n650065: Last digit is 5, so divisible by 5: 650065 \u00f7 5 = 130013.\n\n130013: Check for divisibility by 7: 130013 \u00f7 7 = 18573.285... not an integer.\n\nBy 11: 1 - 3 + 0 - 0 + 1 - 3 = -4, not divisible by 11.\n\nBy 13: 130013 \u00f7 13 = 10001, which is an integer.\n\nSo, 130013 = 13 \u00d7 10001.\n\nNow, 10001: This is 10000 + 1, which is 10^4 + 1. I'm not sure if this factors further easily, but for now, let's assume it's prime.\n\nSo, 2600260 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 10001.\n\nNow, looking back at 1287 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13.\n\nThe common factor between 1287 and 2600260 is 13.\n\nSo, divide both numerator and denominator by 13:\n\n1287 \u00f7 13 = 99.\n\n2600260 \u00f7 13 = 200020.\n\nSo, \\( P = \\frac{99}{200020} \\).\n\nI can check if 99 and 200020 have any common factors.\n\n99 = 9 \u00d7 11 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11.\n\n200020: Last digit is 0, so divisible by 2 and 5.\n\n200020 \u00f7 2 = 100010.\n\n100010 \u00f7 2 = 50005.\n\n50005: Last digit is 5, so divisible by 5: 50005 \u00f7 5 = 10001.\n\nSo, 200020 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10001.\n\nNow, 10001: I'm not sure if this factors further, but it doesn't seem to be divisible by 3, 7, 11, etc., so let's assume it's prime.\n\nSo, 99 and 200020 have no more common factors, as 10001 isn't divisible by 3, and 99 doesn't have 2 or 5 as factors.\n\nTherefore, the simplified probability is \\( \\frac{99}{200020} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as \\( \\frac{1287}{2600260} \\), but \\( \\frac{99}{200020} \\) is simpler.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a sense of how likely this is.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{99}{200020} \\) is approximately 0.000495, or 0.0495%.\n\nSo, it's a pretty rare event to draw 5 hearts in a row without replacement from a standard deck.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to think about probabilities at each draw, considering that the draws are without replacement.\n\nSo, the probability that the first card is a heart is \\( \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nGiven that the first card is a heart, there are now 12 hearts left and 51 cards total, so the probability that the second card is also a heart is \\( \\frac{12}{51} \\).\n\nSimilarly, if the first two are hearts, the probability that the third is a heart is \\( \\frac{11}{50} \\), the fourth is \\( \\frac{10}{49} \\), and the fifth is \\( \\frac{9}{48} \\).\n\nSo, the combined probability is \\( \\frac{13}{52} \\times \\frac{12}{51} \\times \\frac{11}{50} \\times \\frac{10}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{48} \\).\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{12}{51} = \\frac{12}{204} = \\frac{1}{17} \\).\n\nNext, \\( \\frac{1}{17} \\times \\frac{11}{50} = \\frac{11}{850} \\).\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{11}{850} \\times \\frac{10}{49} = \\frac{110}{41650} = \\frac{11}{4165} \\).\n\nFinally, \\( \\frac{11}{4165} \\times \\frac{9}{48} = \\frac{99}{200020} \\), which matches the earlier simplified fraction.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is \\( \\frac{99}{200020} \\), or approximately 0.000495.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all 5 cards drawn at random without replacement are hearts is \\( \\frac{99}{200020} \\), which simplifies to approximately 0.000495, or 0.0495%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{99}{200020}} \\]"
