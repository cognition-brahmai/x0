We'll need to design classes for products, payments, and the vending machine itself. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to define what a product is in our vending machine. Each product should have a name, a price, and a quantity available. We can create a `Product` class for this.\n\nNext, we need to handle different payment methods. For simplicity, let's consider cash payments and maybe credit card payments. We can create a base class called `Payment` and derived classes for each payment method.\n\nThen, the vending machine should have a inventory of products, accept payments, and dispense products based on the user's selection and the payment received.\n\nLet's start by defining the `Product` class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a C++ program that simulates a vending machine with multiple products and different payment methods, we will design classes for products, payments, and the vending machine itself. This approach allows us to organize the code effectively and handle various functionalities seamlessly.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Product Class**: Represents the products available in the vending machine, including their name, price, and quantity.\n2. **Payment Classes**: A base class `Payment` and derived classes for specific payment methods like `Cash` and `CreditCard`.\n3. **VendingMachine Class**: Manages the inventory of products, handles user interactions, accepts payments, and dispenses products.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n\n// Product class\nclass Product {\npublic:\n    Product(const std::string& name, double price, int quantity)\n        : name(name), price(price), quantity(quantity) {}\n\n    const std::string& getName() const { return name; }\n    double getPrice() const { return price; }\n    int getQuantity() const { return quantity; }\n    void decrementQuantity() { if (quantity > 0) quantity--; }\n\nprivate:\n    std::string name;\n    double price;\n    int quantity;\n};\n\n// Payment base class\nclass Payment {\npublic:\n    virtual bool pay(double amount) = 0;\n    virtual ~Payment() {}\n};\n\n// Cash payment class\nclass Cash : public Payment {\npublic:\n    bool pay(double amount) override {\n        // Simulate cash payment\n        std::cout << \"Paid \" << amount << \" in cash.\" << std::endl;\n        return true;\n    }\n};\n\n// CreditCard payment class\nclass CreditCard : public Payment {\npublic:\n    bool pay(double amount) override {\n        // Simulate credit card payment\n        std::cout << \"Paid \" << amount << \" via credit card.\" << std::endl;\n        return true;\n    }\n};\n\n// VendingMachine class\nclass VendingMachine {\npublic:\n    void addProduct(const Product& product) {\n        products.push_back(product);\n    }\n\n    void listProducts() const {\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < products.size(); ++i) {\n            const Product& product = products[i];\n            std::cout << i + 1 << \". \" << product.getName() << \" - $\" << product.getPrice();\n            if (product.getQuantity() > 0) {\n                std::cout << \" - Available\" << std::endl;\n            } else {\n                std::cout << \" - Sold Out\" << std::endl;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    bool purchase(int selection, Payment& payment) {\n        if (selection <= 0 || selection > static_cast<int>(products.size())) {\n            std::cout << \"Invalid selection.\" << std::endl;\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        Product& product = products[selection - 1];\n        if (product.getQuantity() == 0) {\n            std::cout << \"Sold out.\" << std::endl;\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        double amount = product.getPrice();\n        if (payment.pay(amount)) {\n            product.decrementQuantity();\n            std::cout << \"Dispensing \" << product.getName() << std::endl;\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Payment failed.\" << std::endl;\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::vector<Product> products;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    VendingMachine vm;\n\n    // Add some products to the vending machine\n    vm.addProduct(Product(\"Coke\", 1.50, 5));\n    vm.addProduct(Product(\"Chips\", 1.00, 10));\n    vm.addProduct(Product(\"Candy\", 0.75, 15));\n\n    // Create payment methods\n    Cash cash;\n    CreditCard creditCard;\n\n    int choice;\n    int selection;\n    Payment* paymentMethod;\n\n    do {\n        vm.listProducts();\n        std::cout << \"Select a product (0 to exit): \";\n        std::cin >> selection;\n\n        if (selection == 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n\n        std::cout << \"Choose payment method (1 - Cash, 2 - Credit Card): \";\n        std::cin >> choice;\n\n        switch (choice) {\n            case 1:\n                paymentMethod = &cash;\n                break;\n            case 2:\n                paymentMethod = &creditCard;\n                break;\n            default:\n                std::cout << \"Invalid payment method.\" << std::endl;\n                continue;\n        }\n\n        vm.purchase(selection, *paymentMethod);\n    } while (true);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Product Class**: Manages product details like name, price, and quantity.\n2. **Payment Classes**: Abstract base class `Payment` with derived classes `Cash` and `CreditCard` to handle different payment methods.\n3. **VendingMachine Class**: Manages the list of products, displays them, and handles the purchase process including payment and dispensing the product.\n\nThis structure ensures that the program is modular, easy to understand, and maintainable. You can expand this basic framework by adding more features like user interfaces, error handling, or more complex payment processing."
