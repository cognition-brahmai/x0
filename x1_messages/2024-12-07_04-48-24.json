        "content": "So the factory is producing two different products, A and B, right? Let's see how many units of each they make daily. For product A, it's 450 units per day, and for product B, it's 350 units per day. Now, each unit of product A needs 2 hours of labor, and each unit of product B needs 3 hours of labor. I need to find out the total hours of labor required each day for both products combined.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the labor hours needed for product A alone. Since each unit of A takes 2 hours, and they produce 450 units, I can multiply 450 by 2. That should give me the total labor hours for A.\n\n450 units * 2 hours/unit = 900 hours\n\nOkay, so 900 hours are needed for product A each day.\n\nNext, for product B, which is 350 units per day, and each unit requires 3 hours of labor. So, 350 units * 3 hours/unit should give me the total labor hours for B.\n\n350 units * 3 hours/unit = 1050 hours\n\nSo, 1050 hours are needed for product B each day.\n\nNow, to find the total labor hours required for both products, I just need to add the hours for A and B together.\n\n900 hours (A) + 1050 hours (B) = 1950 hours\n\nTherefore, the factory requires 1950 hours of labor each day to produce both products.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with product A: 450 units * 2 hours/unit = 900 hours. That seems correct.\n\nProduct B: 350 units * 3 hours/unit = 1050 hours. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up: 900 + 1050 = 1950 hours. Yeah, that appears to be the total labor hours required per day.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here, unless there are additional labor requirements not mentioned in the problem. But based on the information provided, 1950 hours is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1950} \\]"
