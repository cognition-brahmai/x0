        "content": "To solve the differential equation dy/dx = y/x with the initial condition y(1) = 1, we can use the method of separation of variables.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the equation as:\n\ndy/y = dx/x\n\nThen, we integrate both sides:\n\n\u222b(1/y) dy = \u222b(1/x) dx\n\nwhich gives:\n\nln|y| = ln|x| + c\n\nwhere c is the constant of integration.\n\nExponentiating both sides, we get:\n\n|y| = e^(ln|x| + c) = e^(ln|x|) * e^c = |x| * e^c\n\nSince e^c is always positive, we can write:\n\ny = kx\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition y(1) = 1:\n\n1 = k * 1 => k = 1\n\nTherefore, the solution is y = x.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{y = x} \\]"
