We need to find out how many non-defective widgets both factories produce together in 8 hours.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many widgets each factory produces in 8 hours.\n\nFactory A produces 300 widgets per hour. So in 8 hours, it would produce:\n\n300 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 2400 widgets\n\nFactory B produces 200 widgets per hour. So in 8 hours, it would produce:\n\n200 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 1600 widgets\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of defective widgets for each factory.\n\nFactory A has a defect rate of 2%. So the number of defective widgets from Factory A is:\n\n2% of 2400 = 0.02 * 2400 = 48 widgets\n\nFactory B has a defect rate of 4%. So the number of defective widgets from Factory B is:\n\n4% of 1600 = 0.04 * 1600 = 64 widgets\n\nNow, to find the number of non-defective widgets, we subtract the defective widgets from the total widgets produced by each factory.\n\nNon-defective widgets from Factory A:\n\n2400 - 48 = 2352 widgets\n\nNon-defective widgets from Factory B:\n\n1600 - 64 = 1536 widgets\n\nFinally, to find the total non-defective widgets produced by both factories together, we add the non-defective widgets from both factories:\n\n2352 + 1536 = 3888 widgets\n\nSo, together, both factories produce 3888 non-defective widgets in 8 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3888} \\]"
