        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The store sells apples in bags containing 4, 6, and 9 apples each. The customer wants to buy exactly 100 apples without any leftovers, and we need to find the minimum number of bags required to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to find combinations of bags whose total number of apples adds up to 100. The bags come in three sizes: 4 apples, 6 apples, and 9 apples. Let's denote the number of 4-apple bags as x, the number of 6-apple bags as y, and the number of 9-apple bags as z. So, the equation we need to solve is:\n\n4x + 6y + 9z = 100\n\nAnd we want to minimize the total number of bags, which is x + y + z.\n\nThis seems like a Diophantine equation problem, where we need to find non-negative integer solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy the equation.\n\nOne approach is to try to maximize the number of largest bags (9-apple bags) to minimize the total number of bags. Let's see how many 9-apple bags we can use.\n\nIf we use z = 11 bags of 9 apples, that would be 9*11 = 99 apples, leaving us with 100 - 99 = 1 apple. But we don't have a bag that contains 1 apple, so that doesn't work.\n\nIf we use z = 10 bags of 9 apples, that's 9*10 = 90 apples, leaving 100 - 90 = 10 apples. Now, we need to make 10 apples using bags of 4 and 6 apples.\n\nLet's see:\n\n4x + 6y = 10\n\nWe can try y = 1, which gives 6*1 = 6 apples, leaving 10 - 6 = 4 apples, which can be filled with x = 1 bag of 4 apples.\n\nSo, total bags would be x + y + z = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 bags.\n\nIs there a way to use fewer bags?\n\nLet's try z = 9 bags of 9 apples: 9*9 = 81 apples, leaving 100 - 81 = 19 apples.\n\nNow, solve 4x + 6y = 19.\n\nLet's see if there are integer solutions for x and y.\n\nIf y = 1, then 4x + 6*1 = 4x + 6 = 19 \u2192 4x = 13 \u2192 x = 13/4, which is not an integer.\n\ny = 2: 4x + 12 = 19 \u2192 4x = 7 \u2192 x = 7/4, not integer.\n\ny = 3: 4x + 18 = 19 \u2192 4x = 1 \u2192 x = 1/4, not integer.\n\nNo solutions here.\n\nz = 8: 9*8 = 72, leaving 100 - 72 = 28 apples.\n\nSolve 4x + 6y = 28.\n\ny = 1: 4x + 6 = 28 \u2192 4x = 22 \u2192 x = 5.5, not integer.\n\ny = 2: 4x + 12 = 28 \u2192 4x = 16 \u2192 x = 4.\n\nSo, x = 4, y = 2, z = 8 \u2192 total bags = 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 bags.\n\nThat's more than the previous 12 bags.\n\nz = 7: 9*7 = 63, leaving 100 - 63 = 37 apples.\n\n4x + 6y = 37.\n\ny = 1: 4x + 6 = 37 \u2192 4x = 31 \u2192 x = 7.75, not integer.\n\ny = 2: 4x + 12 = 37 \u2192 4x = 25 \u2192 x = 6.25, not integer.\n\ny = 3: 4x + 18 = 37 \u2192 4x = 19 \u2192 x = 4.75, not integer.\n\ny = 4: 4x + 24 = 37 \u2192 4x = 13 \u2192 x = 3.25, not integer.\n\ny = 5: 4x + 30 = 37 \u2192 4x = 7 \u2192 x = 1.75, not integer.\n\ny = 6: 4x + 36 = 37 \u2192 4x = 1 \u2192 x = 0.25, not integer.\n\nNo solutions here.\n\nz = 6: 9*6 = 54, leaving 100 -

3y\n\nx = (50 - 3y)/2\n\nFor x to be an integer, (50 - 3y) must be even.\n\nLet's find y such that 50 - 3y is even.\n\n50 is even, 3y must be even, so y must be even.\n\nLet y = 0: x = (50 - 0)/2 = 25\n\ny = 2: x = (50 - 6)/2 = 22\n\ny = 4: x = (50 - 12)/2 = 19\n\ny = 6: x = (50 - 18)/2 = 16\n\ny = 8: x = (50 - 24)/2 = 13\n\ny = 10: x = (50 - 30)/2 = 10\n\ny = 12: x = (50 - 36)/2 = 7\n\ny = 14: x = (50 - 42)/2 = 4\n\ny = 16: x = (50 - 48)/2 = 1\n\nSo, possible solutions are:\n\n(25,0,0) \u2192 total bags = 25\n\n(22,2,0) \u2192 total bags = 24\n\n(19,4,0) \u2192 total bags = 23\n\n(16,6,0) \u2192 total bags = 22\n\n(13,8,0) \u2192 total bags = 21\n\n(10,10,0) \u2192 total bags = 20\n\n(7,12,0) \u2192 total bags = 19\n\n(4,14,0) \u2192 total bags = 18\n\n(1,16,0) \u2192 total bags = 17\n\nBut earlier, with z = 10, y =1, x=1, total bags =12, which is better.\n\nWait, but z=10, y=1, x=1: 9*10 + 6*1 + 4*1 = 90 + 6 + 4 = 100.\n\nTotal bags = 12.\n\nWith z=0, even if we go down to x=1, y=16, total bags=17, which is worse than 12.\n\nSo, maybe 12 is the minimum.\n\nBut let's check if there's a combination with z=11, but earlier we saw that leaves 1 apple, which doesn't work.\n\nWhat about z=9? We saw no solution.\n\nz=8: x=4, y=2, z=8 \u2192 total bags=14.\n\nz=7: no solution.\n\nz=6: x=10, y=1, z=6 \u2192 total bags=17.\n\nz=5: no solution.\n\nz=4: x=16, y=0, z=4 \u2192 total bags=20.\n\nz=3: no solution.\n\nz=2: x=19, y=1, z=2 \u2192 total bags=22.\n\nz=1: no solution.\n\nz=0: as above, minimum bags is 17.\n\nSo, the minimum number of bags seems to be 12 when using z=10, y=1, x=1.\n\nBut is there a way to use fewer bags?\n\nLet me consider if there's a combination where z=11, but that leaves 1 apple, which doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use z=10, y=1, x=1, which is 12 bags, as previously found.\n\nIs there a way to use z=10, y=0, x=3: 9*10 + 4*3 = 90 + 12 = 102, which is over.\n\nOr z=10, y=2, x=-1, which is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe z=9, y=3, x=2: 9*9 + 6*3 + 4*2 = 81 + 18 + 8 = 107, which is over.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, z=9, y=2, x=4: 9*9 + 6*2 + 4*4 = 81 + 12 + 16 = 109, also over.\n\nz=9, y=1, x=6: 9*9 + 6*1 + 4*6 = 81 + 6 + 24 = 111, again over.\n\nz=9, y=0, x=9: 9*9 + 0 + 4*9 = 81 + 0 + 36 = 117, over.\n\nSo, z=9 doesn't help.\n\nWhat about z=11, y=-1, x=5: not valid.\n\nSeems like z=10, y=1, x=1 is the best so far.\n\nLet me check z=10, y=0, x=5: 9*10 + 0 + 4*5 = 90 + 0 + 20 = 110, over.\n\nz=10, y=2, x=-1: invalid.\n\nSo, z=10, y=1, x=1 is the only valid combination with z=10.\n\nIs there a way to use z=11? 9*11 = 99, leaves 1 apple, no bag for that.\n\nz=12: 9*12 = 108, which is over, and adjusting with negative bags isn't possible.\n\nSo, it seems that 12 bags is the minimum.\n\nBut let's see if there's a combination with fewer bags using different z values.\n\nWait, when z=8, x=4, y=2: total bags=14.\n\nz=6, x=10, y=1: total bags=17.\n\nz=4, x=16, y=0: total bags=20.\n\nz=2, x=19, y=1: total bags=22.\n\nz=0, x=25, y=0: total bags=25.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought z=10, y=1, x=1: 12 bags.\n\nIs there a way to use z=11? No, as it leaves 1 apple.\n\nz=10 seems to be the maximum z that works, with y=1 and x=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use fewer bags with higher y and lower z.\n\nLet's try z=9: no solution.\n\nz=8: x=4, y=2: total bags=14.\n\nz=7: no solution.\n\nz=6: x=10, y=1: total bags=17.\n\nWait, maybe try z=5: no solution.\n\nz=4: x=16, y=0: total bags=20.\n\nz=3: no solution.\n\nz=2: x=19, y=1: total bags=22.\n\nz=1: no solution.\n\nz=0: x=25, y=0: total bags=25.\n\nSo, indeed, z=10, y=1, x=1: total bags=12 seems to be the minimum.\n\nBut is there a way to use z=10, y=0, x=3: 9*10 + 4*3 = 90 + 12 = 102, which is over.\n\nOr z=10, y=2, x=-1: invalid.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use z=11, but that leaves 1 apple, which isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of bags is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
