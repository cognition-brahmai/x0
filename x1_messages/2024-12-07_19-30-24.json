Leap years are special years that have an extra day in February to account for the Earth's actual time to orbit the sun, which is approximately 365.24 days.\n\nFirst, let's understand the rules for determining a leap year:\n\n1. If a year is evenly divisible by 4, it could be a leap year.\n\n2. However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it's not a leap year, unless...\n\n3. The year is also divisible by 400. In that case, it is a leap year.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4.\n\n- But if it's divisible by 100, it's not a leap year, unless it's also divisible by 400.\n\nLet me give you some examples to make it clearer:\n\n- 2000: Divisible by 4, by 100, and by 400. So, it's a leap year.\n\n- 1900: Divisible by 4 and by 100, but not by 400. So, it's not a leap year.\n\n- 2004: Divisible by 4, not by 100. So, it's a leap year.\n\n- 2001: Not divisible by 4. So, not a leap year.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript. We'll create a function that takes a year as input and returns true if it's a leap year, and false otherwise.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Check if the year is divisible by 4.\n\n2. If it is, check if it's divisible by 100.\n\na. If it is divisible by 100, then check if it's divisible by 400.\n\ni. If it is divisible by 400, it's a leap year.\n\nii. If not, it's not a leap year.\n\nb. If it's not divisible by 100, it's a leap year.\n\n3. If it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year.\n\nThis logic can be implemented using if-else statements.\n\nLet me sketch out the code structure:\n\nfunction isLeapYear(year) {\n\nif (year divisible by 4) {\n\nif (year divisible by 100) {\n\nif (year divisible by 400) {\n\nreturn true;\n\n} else {\n\nreturn false;\n\n}\n\n} else {\n\nreturn true;\n\n}\n\n} else {\n\nreturn false;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nWe can make this code cleaner by combining some conditions.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the logical AND (&&) and OR (||) operators to simplify the expressions.\n\nAlso, remember that in JavaScript, we can check divisibility using the modulo operator (%). If year % divisor == 0, then it's divisible by that divisor.\n\nSo, year % 4 == 0 means it's divisible by 4.\n\nSimilarly for 100 and 400.\n\nLet me write the function with these considerations.\n\nBut before that, let's think about edge cases and potential issues.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- Year is negative: In reality, years can be negative (B.C.), but for simplicity, we'll assume the year is A.D. (Anno Domini).\n\n- Year is not an integer: Leap year is defined for whole years, so we'll assume the input is an integer.\n\n- Year is too large or too small: JavaScript handles integers accurately up to certain limits, but for years, it should be fine.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\n- Non-integer inputs: We should ensure that the input is a integer.\n\n- Non-numeric inputs: The input should be a number.\n\nTo handle these, we can add input validation.\n\nBut for now, let's assume the input is a valid integer year.\n\nI'll write the function without input validation first, and then we can consider adding it if needed.\n\nSo, here's the initial implementation:\n\nfunction isLeapYear(year) {\n\nif (year % 4 === 0) {\n\nif (year % 100 === 0) {\n\nif (year % 400 === 0) {\n\nreturn true;\n\n} else {\n\nreturn false;\n\n}\n\n} else {\n\nreturn true;\n\n}\n\n} else {\n\nreturn false;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis is clear and straightforward, but we can make it more concise.\n\nLet's try to simplify it.\n\nWe can use the logical operators to combine the conditions.\n\nFor example:\n\nif (year % 4 === 0 && (year % 100 !== 0 || year % 400 === 0)) {\n\nreturn true;\n\n} else {\n\nreturn false;\n\n}\n\nThis is shorter and achieves the same result.\n\nAlternatively, since the condition directly returns a boolean, we can write:\n\nreturn year % 4 === 0 && (year % 100 !== 0 || year % 400 === 0);\n\nThis is even more concise.\n\nLet me verify this logic with some test cases.\n\nTest Cases:\n\n1. Year: 2000\n\n- 2000 % 4 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 2000 % 100 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 2000 % 400 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- So, true\n\n2. Year: 1900\n\n- 1900 % 4 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 1900 % 100 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 1900 % 400 === 0 \u2192 false\n\n- So, false\n\n3. Year: 2004\n\n- 2004 % 4 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 2004 % 100 === 0 \u2192 false\n\n- So, true\n\n4. Year: 2001\n\n- 2001 % 4 === 0 \u2192 false\n\n- So, false\n\n5. Year: 2400\n\n- 2400 % 4 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 2400 % 100 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 2400 % 400 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- So, true\n\n6. Year: 2300\n\n- 2300 % 4 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 2300 % 100 === 0 \u2192 true\n\n- 2300 % 400 === 0 \u2192 false\n\n- So, false\n\nThese test cases confirm that the logic is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about user interaction.\n\nYou mentioned that the year is entered by the user, so we need to get the input from the user, probably through a prompt or an input field, depending on the context (browser or Node.js environment).\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume we're working in a browser environment, so we can use prompt() to get user input.\n\nHere's how we can structure the complete code:\n\n1. Prompt the user to enter a year.\n\n2. Convert the input to an integer.\n\n3. Call the isLeapYear function with the year.\n\n4. Alert or log the result to the user.\n\nLet me write that code.\n\nBut first, let's consider input validation.\n\nInput Validation:\n\n- Ensure the input is a number.\n\n- Ensure the input is an integer.\n\n- Handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values or decimals.\n\nTo handle this, we can use parseInt() to convert the input to an integer.\n\nWe should also check if the input is not NaN (Not a Number).\n\nHere's how we can do it:\n\nlet yearInput = prompt(\"Enter a year:\");\n\nlet year = parseInt(yearInput);\n\nif (isNaN(year)) {\n\nalert(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer year.\");\n\n} else {\n\nlet isLeap = isLeapYear(year);\n\nif (isLeap) {\n\nalert(year + \" is a leap year.\");\n\n} else {\n\nalert(year + \" is not a leap year.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis way, we handle invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nNow, let's put it all together.\n\nComplete Code:\n\nfunction isLeapYear(year) {\n\nreturn year % 4 === 0 && (year % 100 !== 0 || year % 400 === 0);\n\n}\n\nlet yearInput = prompt(\"Enter a year:\");\n\nlet year = parseInt(yearInput);\n\nif (isNaN(year)) {\n\nalert(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer year.\");\n\n} else {\n\nlet isLeap = isLeapYear(year);\n\nif (isLeap) {\n\nalert(year + \" is a leap year.\");\n\n} else {\n\nalert(year + \" is not a leap year.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis should work as expected in a browser environment.\n\nIf you're using Node.js, you can use the readline module to get user input.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the environment, I'll stick with the browser approach.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo determine if a year is a leap year in JavaScript, you can use the following function. This function checks if the year is divisible by 4, not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.\n\n```javascript\nfunction isLeapYear(year) {\n    return year % 4 === 0 && (year % 100 !== 0 || year % 400 === 0);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet yearInput = prompt(\"Enter a year:\");\nlet year = parseInt(yearInput);\n\nif (isNaN(year)) {\n    alert(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer year.\");\n} else {\n    let isLeap = isLeapYear(year);\n    if (isLeap) {\n        alert(year + \" is a leap year.\");\n    } else {\n        alert(year + \" is not a leap year.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Leap Year Logic**:\n   - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n   - If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.\n\n2. **Function `isLeapYear`**:\n   - Takes a year as input and returns `true` if it is a leap year, otherwise `false`.\n\n3. **User Interaction**:\n   - Prompts the user to enter a year.\n   - Parses the input to an integer.\n   - Checks if the input is a valid integer.\n   - Uses the `isLeapYear` function to determine if the year is a leap year and alerts the result."
