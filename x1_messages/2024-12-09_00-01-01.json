        "content": "So I have this problem: a tree grows 2 cm per day, and I need to find out how many meters it will grow in a year. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days there are in a year. A standard year has 365 days. Some years have 366 days if it's a leap year, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume it's a regular year with 365 days.\n\nSo, the tree grows 2 cm every day for 365 days. To find the total growth in centimeters, I can multiply the daily growth by the number of days:\n\nTotal growth in cm = 2 cm/day \u00d7 365 days\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n2 \u00d7 365 = 730 cm\n\nSo, the tree grows 730 cm in a year.\n\nBut the question asks for the growth in meters, not centimeters. I know that 1 meter equals 100 centimeters. Therefore, to convert centimeters to meters, I need to divide the total centimeters by 100.\n\nTotal growth in meters = 730 cm \u00f7 100\n\nLet's do that division:\n\n730 \u00f7 100 = 7.3 meters\n\nSo, the tree will grow 7.3 meters in a year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 2 cm per day for 365 days is 2 \u00d7 365 = 730 cm. That seems right.\n\nThen, converting 730 cm to meters: since 100 cm make a meter, 730 \u00f7 100 should be 7.3 meters. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of units. cm/day \u00d7 days = cm. Then, cm \u00f7 100 = meters.\n\nEverything checks out. I think 7.3 meters is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.3} \\]"
