        "content": "Let's solve this system of equations. We have two equations:\n\n1. \\( y = 2x - 3 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3x + y = 7 \\)\n\nSince the first equation is already solved for \\( y \\), it's straightforward to use the substitution method here. The substitution method involves solving one of the equations for one variable and then substituting that expression into the other equation to solve for the other variable.\n\n**Step 1: Substitute the expression for \\( y \\) from equation 1 into equation 2.**\n\nGiven that \\( y = 2x - 3 \\), we can plug this directly into equation 2 in place of \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 3x + (2x - 3) = 7 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equation to solve for \\( x \\).**\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 3x + 2x - 3 = 7 \\)\n\n\\( 5x - 3 = 7 \\)\n\nNow, add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\n\\( 5x - 3 + 3 = 7 + 3 \\)\n\n\\( 5x = 10 \\)\n\nThen, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = \\frac{10}{5} \\)\n\n\\( x = 2 \\)\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the value of \\( x \\) back into one of the original equations to find \\( y \\).**\n\nLet's use equation 1, since it's already solved for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( y = 2x - 3 \\)\n\nPlug in \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\( y = 2(2) - 3 \\)\n\n\\( y = 4 - 3 \\)\n\n\\( y = 1 \\)\n\n**Step 4: Verify the solution by plugging both values back into both original equations.**\n\nFirst, check equation 1:\n\n\\( y = 2x - 3 \\)\n\n\\( 1 = 2(2) - 3 \\)\n\n\\( 1 = 4 - 3 \\)\n\n\\( 1 = 1 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, check equation 2:\n\n\\( 3x + y = 7 \\)\n\n\\( 3(2) + 1 = 7 \\)\n\n\\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\)\n\n\\( 7 = 7 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth equations are satisfied with \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\), so our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(2,1)} \\]"
