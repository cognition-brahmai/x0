        "content": "Let's tackle this conversion problem step by step. The user wants to know how many gallons of water a person drinks in a month if they consume an average of 3 liters per day, assuming a month has 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the units involved. We have liters and gallons, which are both units of volume, and we're dealing with a time frame of days and months.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total volume of water consumed in liters per month.\n\nSince the person drinks 3 liters per day and there are 30 days in the month, I can multiply these two values to get the total liters consumed in a month.\n\nTotal liters per month = 3 liters/day \u00d7 30 days = 90 liters\n\nStep 2: Convert liters to gallons.\n\nNow, I need to convert 90 liters to gallons. I should know the conversion factor between liters and gallons. I recall that 1 liter is approximately equal to 0.264172 gallons.\n\nSo, to convert liters to gallons, I multiply the number of liters by the conversion factor.\n\nGallons = 90 liters \u00d7 0.264172 gallons/liter\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n90 \u00d7 0.264172 = 23.77548 gallons\n\nStep 3: Round the answer to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n\nSince the original data is given to one decimal place (3 liters per day, and 30 days), it's appropriate to round our answer to two decimal places for precision.\n\nSo, 23.77548 gallons rounds to 23.78 gallons.\n\nTherefore, a person who drinks an average of 3 liters of water per day would consume approximately 23.78 gallons of water in a 30-day month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23.78} \\]"
