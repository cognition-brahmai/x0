        "content": "I've heard about the boiling frog analogy before. It's often used to suggest that people don't notice gradual changes because they happen so slowly. The idea is that if you put a frog in cold water and gradually heat it up, the frog won't try to jump out even as the water boils, but if you put a frog in boiling water, it will try to escape immediately.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's actually accurate. I think there was some research that debunked this idea. I recall reading that in reality, if you put a frog in gradually heating water, it will eventually try to jump out when it gets too hot, just like it would if you put it in boiling water immediately.\n\nSo, maybe the analogy isn't entirely accurate. But it's still commonly used to illustrate how people might not react to slow, gradual changes in their environment or circumstances.\n\nWhat do you think about that? Is there any truth to the boiling frog concept, or is it just a myth?"
