However, I can tell you that certain regions on Earth are known for their perpetual snow cover due to their high altitude or extreme latitude. For example, the polar regions like Antarctica and the Arctic experience constant snow and ice throughout the year. Additionally, high mountainous areas such as the Himalayas, Andes, and Alps have permanent snowfields and glaciers. These places receive regular snowfall and maintain cold temperatures that prevent the snow from melting completely."
