        "content": "Given the definitions provided, it seems that astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that deals specifically with the physical properties of celestial objects and the physics of the universe. Observational astronomy involves observing celestial events using telescopes and other instruments, but it's not necessarily focused solely on the physical properties of these objects. Theoretical astronomy uses mathematics and computer models to understand astronomical phenomena, which might include physical properties but isn't limited to them. Planetary astronomy focuses on the study of planets and planetary systems, which is a subset of celestial objects. Therefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be D. Astrophysics.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, let's consider each option in more detail.\n\nA. Observational astronomy: This branch of astronomy is primarily concerned with making observations of celestial objects and events using various instruments, including telescopes that operate in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as optical, radio, X-ray, and so on. While observational astronomy does provide data about the physical properties of celestial objects, its main focus is on gathering data rather than interpreting the physical characteristics.\n\nB. Theoretical astronomy: This branch involves the development of computer models and theoretical frameworks to explain astronomical phenomena. It uses physics, mathematics, and computational methods to simulate and predict the behavior of celestial objects and systems. While it does deal with the physical properties of celestial objects, it does so in a more abstract and modeling-oriented way compared to astrophysics.\n\nC. Planetary astronomy: This branch focuses specifically on the study of planets, moons, and other bodies within our solar system and, increasingly, exoplanets orbiting other stars. It deals with the physical properties of these objects, such as their composition, atmospheres, geology, and evolution. While it is concerned with physical properties, it is limited to planetary bodies and not the entire universe.\n\nD. Astrophysics: As defined, astrophysics is a branch of astronomy that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to interpret the nature of celestial objects and phenomena. It seeks to understand the physical processes that govern the universe, including the properties of stars, galaxies, black holes, and the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\n\nGiven these distinctions, astrophysics is the branch most broadly concerned with the physical properties of celestial objects across the entire universe, making it the best answer to the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
