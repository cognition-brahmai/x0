But I guess what really makes me happy is just being able to spend time with my friends and family, even if things don't always go as planned. Like, remember that time I tried to kick the football and Lucy pulled it away? Yeah, not my proudest moment, but it's those little setbacks that make the good times all the more special. So, in a way, happiness is about finding joy in the simple things and cherishing the people who stick by you through thick and thin. And, of course, having a good sandwich never hurts either!"
