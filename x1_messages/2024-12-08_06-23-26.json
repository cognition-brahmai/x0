        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle, and it's given that its length is twice its width. Also, the perimeter of this rectangle is 36 meters. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) is the sum of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula is:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times \\text{length} + 2 \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nor more compactly,\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the length is twice the width. So, we can express the length in terms of the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 36 meters, we can substitute the values into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ 36 = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nBut since \\( l = 2w \\), we can substitute \\( 2w \\) for \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 36 = 2(2w + w) \\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 36 = 2(3w) \\]\n\n\\[ 36 = 6w \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{36}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ w = 6 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length using \\( l = 2w \\):\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times 6 \\]\n\n\\[ l = 12 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle are 12 meters in length and 6 meters in width.\n\nTo double-check, let's plug these values back into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) = 2(12 + 6) = 2 \\times 18 = 36 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nYes, that matches the given perimeter. Also, the length is indeed twice the width, as 12 is twice 6. So, our solution seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the rectangle are \\(\\boxed{12 \\text{ meters} \\times 6 \\text{ meters}}\\)."
