        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a new sports complex. There are three main parts: a stadium, an indoor arena, and multiple outdoor fields. The total budget for construction is $150 million. The budget is allocated as follows: 40% for the stadium, 30% for the indoor arena, and the remaining 30% for the outdoor fields. I need to calculate the individual budgets for each facility and then estimate the total seating capacity, given the average cost per seat for each facility.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the individual budgets.\n\n1. **Stadium Budget:**\n\n   The stadium gets 40% of the total budget.\n\n   So, stadium budget = 40% of $150 million.\n\n   To calculate that: (40/100) * 150,000,000 = 0.4 * 150,000,000 = $60,000,000.\n\n2. **Indoor Arena Budget:**\n\n   The indoor arena gets 30% of the total budget.\n\n   So, indoor arena budget = 30% of $150 million.\n\n   Calculation: (30/100) * 150,000,000 = 0.3 * 150,000,000 = $45,000,000.\n\n3. **Outdoor Fields Budget:**\n\n   Also 30% of the total budget.\n\n   So, outdoor fields budget = 30% of $150 million.\n\n   Calculation: (30/100) * 150,000,000 = 0.3 * 150,000,000 = $45,000,000.\n\nOkay, so now I have the individual budgets:\n\n- Stadium: $60 million\n\n- Indoor Arena: $45 million\n\n- Outdoor Fields: $45 million\n\nNext, I need to estimate the total seating capacity for each facility, given the average cost per seat.\n\n1. **Stadium Seating Capacity:**\n\n   Average cost per seat: $500.\n\n   So, seating capacity = stadium budget / cost per seat.\n\n   Calculation: 60,000,000 / 500 = 120,000 seats.\n\n2. **Indoor Arena Seating Capacity:**\n\n   Average cost per seat: $400.\n\n   Seating capacity = indoor arena budget / cost per seat.\n\n   Calculation: 45,000,000 / 400 = 112,500 seats.\n\n3. **Outdoor Fields Seating Capacity:**\n\n   Average cost per seat: $200.\n\n   Seating capacity = outdoor fields budget / cost per seat.\n\n   Calculation: 45,000,000 / 200 = 225,000 seats.\n\nNow, to find the total seating capacity, I'll add up the seating capacities of all three facilities.\n\nTotal seating capacity = stadium seats + indoor arena seats + outdoor fields seats.\n\nCalculation: 120,000 + 112,500 + 225,000 = 457,500 seats.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of seats. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the individual budgets:\n\n- Stadium: 40% of $150 million = 0.4 * 150,000,000 = $60,000,000. That seems correct.\n\n- Indoor Arena: 30% of $150 million = 0.3 * 150,000,000 = $45,000,000. Correct.\n\n- Outdoor Fields: 30% of $150 million = 0.3 * 150,000,000 = $45,000,000. Correct.\n\nNow, seating capacities:\n\n- Stadium: $60,000,000 / $500 per seat = 120,000 seats. Correct.\n\n- Indoor Arena: $45,000,000 / $400 per seat = 112,500 seats. Correct.\n\n- Outdoor Fields: $45,000,000 / $200 per seat = 225,000 seats. Correct.\n\nTotal seating capacity: 120,000 + 112,500 + 225,000 = 457,500 seats. That does seem like a high number, but based on the given averages, it's the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outdoor fields have a higher seating capacity because the cost per seat is lower, which could make sense if they are smaller individual fields with less expensive seating arrangements.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{457500} \\]"
