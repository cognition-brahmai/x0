        "content": "So I've got this series to figure out: the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1 over n squared, right? So, \u2211(1/n\u00b2) for n=1 to \u221e. I need to determine if this thing converges or diverges. Now, I remember there are several tests to check for convergence of series, like the ratio test, the root test, the comparison test, and so on. But I'm not sure which one to use here.\n\nLet me think about this. The series is \u2211(1/n\u00b2). It looks similar to the harmonic series, which is \u2211(1/n), and I know that diverges. But here, instead of 1/n, it's 1/n\u00b2, which decreases faster as n gets larger. So maybe it converges?\n\nI think the comparison test might be useful here. I know that \u2211(1/n^p) is a p-series, and it converges if p > 1 and diverges if p \u2264 1. In this case, p = 2, which is greater than 1, so it should converge. But I should probably show this more rigorously.\n\nMaybe I can use the integral test. The integral test says that if you have a function f(x) that's positive, continuous, and decreasing for x \u2265 1, then the series \u2211f(n) converges if and only if the integral from 1 to infinity of f(x) dx converges.\n\nSo, let's try that. Let f(x) = 1/x\u00b2. This function is positive, continuous, and decreasing for x \u2265 1. So, I need to evaluate the integral from 1 to infinity of 1/x\u00b2 dx.\n\nComputing the integral: \u222b(1/x\u00b2) dx from 1 to \u221e. The antiderivative of 1/x\u00b2 is -1/x. So, evaluating that from 1 to \u221e:\n\nlim (t\u2192\u221e) [-1/t - (-1/1)] = lim (t\u2192\u221e) [-1/t + 1] = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSince the integral converges to 1, the series \u2211(1/n\u00b2) also converges by the integral test.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the p-series test directly, since \u2211(1/n^p) converges for p > 1, and here p = 2, which is greater than 1, so it converges.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try another test, like the comparison test. I know that \u2211(1/n\u00b2) is less than \u2211(1/n), but \u2211(1/n) diverges, so that doesn't help directly. Wait, no, actually, if I have a series that's smaller than a convergent series, then it also converges, but here, \u2211(1/n\u00b2) is smaller than \u2211(1/n), and \u2211(1/n) diverges, which doesn't tell me anything about the convergence of \u2211(1/n\u00b2).\n\nWait, that's not correct. The comparison test says that if 0 \u2264 a_n \u2264 b_n for all n, and \u2211b_n converges, then \u2211a_n also converges. But in this case, \u2211b_n would be \u2211(1/n), which diverges, and \u2211a_n is \u2211(1/n\u00b2). So, this test is inconclusive here.\n\nMaybe I can compare \u2211(1/n\u00b2) to \u2211(1/n^{1.5}), which is also a convergent p-series with p = 1.5 > 1. Since 1/n\u00b2 < 1/n^{1.5} for n \u2265 1, and \u2211(1/n^{1.5}) converges, then by the comparison test, \u2211(1/n\u00b2) also converges.\n\nWait, but actually, 1/n\u00b2 is smaller than 1/n^{1.5}, so the comparison test would still only tell me that if the larger series converges, then the smaller one does too. But since I already know that \u2211(1/n^{1.5}) converges, and \u2211(1/n\u00b2) is smaller, then yes, \u2211(1/n\u00b2) converges.\n\nBut honestly, using the p-series test or the integral test seems more straightforward here.\n\nAnother test I could consider is the ratio test. The ratio test says that if the limit as n approaches infinity of |a_{n+1}/a_n| is less than 1, then the series converges absolutely.\n\nSo, let's try that. a_n = 1/n\u00b2, a_{n+1} = 1/(n+1)^2.\n\nCompute the limit: lim (n\u2192\u221e) | (1/(n+1)^2) / (1/n\u00b2) | = lim (n\u2192\u221e) (n\u00b2 / (n+1)^2 ) = lim (n\u2192\u221e) (n\u00b2 / (n\u00b2 + 2n + 1)) = lim (n\u2192\u221e) [1 / (1 + 2/n + 1/n\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nSo, the ratio test is inconclusive here because the limit is 1.\n\nHmm, that doesn't help. Maybe I can try the root test. The root test says that if lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^{1/n} < 1, then the series converges absolutely.\n\nSo, a_n = 1/n\u00b2, so |a_n|^{1/n} = (1/n\u00b2)^{1/n} = 1^{1/n} / n^{2/n} = 1 / n^{2/n}.\n\nNow, what is lim (n\u2192\u221e) n^{2/n}? I think n^{1/n} approaches 1 as n approaches infinity, so n^{2/n} would be (n^{1/n})^2, which also approaches 1^2 = 1.\n\nTherefore, lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^{1/n} = 1/1 = 1, which again makes the root test inconclusive.\n\nSo, back to the p-series test or the integral test. I think it's safe to conclude that \u2211(1/n\u00b2) converges since p = 2 > 1.\n\nBut just to explore more, maybe I can think about the partial sums. The partial sum s_k = \u2211(1/n\u00b2) from n=1 to k.\n\nI know that s_k is increasing because each term is positive, and it's bounded above. For example, s_1 = 1, s_2 = 1 + 1/4 = 1.25, s_3 = 1.25 + 1/9 \u2248 1.361, and so on. It seems to be approaching some value.\n\nIn fact, I recall that the sum of \u2211(1/n\u00b2) from n=1 to \u221e is equal to \u03c0\u00b2/6, which is approximately 1.64493. So, it does converge to a specific value.\n\nBut even without knowing the exact sum, based on the p-series test or the integral test, I can confidently say that the series converges.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test says that for a non-increasing sequence a_n of non-negative terms, the series \u2211a_n converges if and only if the series \u22112^k a_{2^k} converges.\n\nSo, let's apply that here. a_n = 1/n\u00b2, so 2^k a_{2^k} = 2^k / (2^k)^2 = 2^k / 2^{2k} = 1/2^k.\n\nSo, the condensed series is \u2211(1/2^k) from k=0 to \u221e, which is a geometric series with ratio 1/2, and it converges to 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2.\n\nSince the condensed series converges, the original series \u2211(1/n\u00b2) also converges by the Cauchy condensation test.\n\nThis is another way to confirm the convergence of the series.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the series as a special case of the Riemann zeta function, where zeta(s) = \u2211(1/n^s) for s > 1. In this case, s = 2, and zeta(2) = \u03c0\u00b2/6, which is a finite value, indicating convergence.\n\nBut perhaps that's getting a bit advanced for this purpose.\n\nIn summary, using the p-series test, the integral test, the comparison test, the Cauchy condensation test, or recognizing it as the Riemann zeta function at s=2, we can conclude that the series \u2211(1/n\u00b2) converges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{converges}}"
