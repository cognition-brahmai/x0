        "content": "Let's see. The restaurant serves 120 customers per day on average, and each customer spends $25 on their meal. It operates 26 days per month. To find the average monthly revenue, I need to calculate the total revenue per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a month it operates.\n\nFirst, the daily revenue would be the number of customers per day times the average spending per customer. So that's 120 customers/day times $25/customer.\n\n120 * 25 = 3,000\n\nSo, the restaurant makes $3,000 per day.\n\nNow, since it operates 26 days a month, the monthly revenue would be the daily revenue times the number of operating days in a month.\n\n3,000 * 26 = 78,000\n\nTherefore, the restaurant's average monthly revenue is $78,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If there are 120 customers per day, each spending $25, and the restaurant operates 26 days a month, then overall, the number of customers in a month would be 120 customers/day * 26 days/month = 3,120 customers/month.\n\nThen, with each customer spending $25, the total monthly revenue would be 3,120 customers * $25/customer = $78,000.\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation. So, $78,000 is the average monthly revenue.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the revenue. For example, are there any discounts or special offers that might change the average spending per customer? Or maybe the number of customers varies significantly from day to day.\n\nBut based on the information provided, we don't have any details about variations in customer spending or attendance. So, we'll assume that the averages given are consistent.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the restaurant operates 26 days per month. That might be an average, considering months have different numbers of days. But since the problem specifies 26 days per month, we'll go with that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the restaurant's average monthly revenue is $78,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78000} \\]"
