According to the World Bank, extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. In 1990, about 36% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty, which has dropped to around 8.6% in 2018. This represents a substantial reduction in the number of people living in extreme poverty, although there is still much work to be done to eradicate poverty entirely."
