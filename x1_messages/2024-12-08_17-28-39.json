        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are 20 marbles in a bag: 6 red, 7 blue, and 7 green. I need to find the probability that if I pick two marbles at random without replacement, both of them will be blue. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is picking two blue marbles in a row without replacing the first one.\n\nSo, total marbles are 20. Out of these, 7 are blue. I'm picking two marbles without replacement, meaning after I pick the first marble, I don't put it back into the bag before picking the second one. This is important because it affects the probabilities.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. For the first pick, the probability of drawing a blue marble is the number of blue marbles divided by the total number of marbles. So, that's 7 blue out of 20 total, which is 7/20.\n\nNow, if I've picked a blue marble first, I don't replace it, so for the second pick, there are now 19 marbles left in the bag, and only 6 of them are blue. So, the probability of picking a blue marble second, given that the first one was blue, is 6/19.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together\u2014first picking a blue marble and then picking another blue marble\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening in sequence.\n\nSo, the overall probability should be (7/20) multiplied by (6/19).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 7 times 6 is 42.\n\nThen, 20 times 19 is 380.\n\nSo, 42/380.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n42 \u00f7 2 = 21\n\n380 \u00f7 2 = 190\n\nSo, 21/190.\n\nAlternatively, I could leave it as a decimal. Let's see:\n\n21 divided by 190 is approximately 0.1105.\n\nTo express it as a percentage, that's about 11.05%.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two blue marbles in a row without replacement is 21/190 or approximately 0.1105.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use combinations. Since the order doesn't matter here (since we're just picking two blue marbles), I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 blue marbles out of 7 is given by the combination formula C(7,2), which is 7 choose 2.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of ways to choose any 2 marbles out of 20 is C(20,2).\n\nSo, the probability is C(7,2) divided by C(20,2).\n\nLet me calculate these combinations.\n\nC(7,2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = (7*6*5!) / (2*1 * 5!) = (7*6) / 2 = 21.\n\nC(20,2) = 20! / (2! * 18!) = (20*19*18!) / (2*1 * 18!)) = (20*19) / 2 = 190.\n\nSo, the probability is 21/190, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nGreat, so that reinforces that my initial calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability without replacement using conditional probability.\n\nThe probability of both marbles being blue is the probability that the first marble is blue AND the second marble is blue.\n\nThis can be expressed as P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A),\n\nwhere P(A) is the probability that the first marble is blue, and P(B|A) is the probability that the second marble is blue given that the first one was blue.\n\nWe already calculated P(A) = 7/20,\n\nand P(B|A) = 6/19.\n\nMultiplying them gives (7/20)*(6/19) = 42/380 = 21/190.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's the correct probability. Unless there's something I'm missing, but I've cross-verified it using different approaches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{21}{190}} \\]"
