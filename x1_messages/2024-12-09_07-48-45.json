        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Alice who has twice as many dimes as nickels, and the total value of her dimes and nickels is $3.95. We need to find out how many nickels she has.\n\nFirst, let's understand the value of each coin:\n\n- A nickel is worth $0.05.\n\n- A dime is worth $0.10.\n\nNow, let's define variables to represent the number of nickels and dimes Alice has.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( n \\) represent the number of nickels.\n\n- Since Alice has twice as many dimes as nickels, the number of dimes would be \\( 2n \\).\n\nNext, we need to set up an equation based on the total value of these coins.\n\nThe total value of the nickels would be \\( 0.05n \\) dollars.\n\nThe total value of the dimes would be \\( 0.10 \\times 2n = 0.20n \\) dollars.\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of these values is $3.95.\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.05n + 0.20n = 3.95 \\]\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n\\[ 0.25n = 3.95 \\]\n\nTo find \\( n \\), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{3.95}{0.25} \\]\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n\\[ n = 15.8 \\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't make sense because the number of nickels should be a whole number. You can't have a fraction of a nickel.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- \\( n \\) = number of nickels\n\n- \\( d \\) = number of dimes = 2n (since she has twice as many dimes as nickels)\n\nThe value equation should be:\n\n\\[ 0.05n + 0.10d = 3.95 \\]\n\nBut since \\( d = 2n \\), substitute that into the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.05n + 0.10(2n) = 3.95 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.05n + 0.20n = 3.95 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.25n = 3.95 \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{3.95}{0.25} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 15.8 \\]\n\nAgain, I'm getting 15.8, which is not a whole number. This suggests that maybe there's an error in the problem setup or possibly in the calculations.\n\nLet me try multiplying both sides by 100 to eliminate decimals, which might make it easier to handle.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\[ 0.05n + 0.10d = 3.95 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\n\\[ 5n + 10d = 395 \\]\n\nNow, since \\( d = 2n \\), substitute:\n\n\\[ 5n + 10(2n) = 395 \\]\n\n\\[ 5n + 20n = 395 \\]\n\n\\[ 25n = 395 \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{395}{25} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 15.8 \\]\n\nStill getting 15.8, which is odd because the number of coins should be whole numbers.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let's check the total amount again.\n\nWait, $3.95 is equal to 395 cents. Let's try doing the problem in cents to avoid decimals.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Number of nickels = \\( n \\)\n\n- Number of dimes = \\( 2n \\)\n\nValue of nickels = \\( 5n \\) cents\n\nValue of dimes = \\( 10 \\times 2n = 20n \\) cents\n\nTotal value = \\( 5n + 20n = 25n \\) cents\n\nGiven that the total value is 395 cents:\n\n\\[ 25n = 395 \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{395}{25} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 15.8 \\]\n\nAgain, 15.8 nickels, which doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there's an error in the problem itself. Maybe the total amount should be different to get whole numbers of coins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that dimes are worth 10 cents and nickels are worth 5 cents, but that seems standard.\n\nLet me consider if there might be a typo in the problem. Maybe it's supposed to be $3.50 instead of $3.95, for example.\n\nLet\u2019s try with $3.50.\n\nSo, total value = $3.50 = 350 cents\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ 25n = 350 \\]\n\n\\[ n = 14 \\]\n\nThat would make sense, as 14 nickels and 28 dimes:\n\nValue of nickels: 14 \u00d7 5 = 70 cents\n\nValue of dimes: 28 \u00d7 10 = 280 cents\n\nTotal: 70 + 280 = 350 cents = $3.50\n\nBut the problem says $3.95, which is 395 cents.\n\nMaybe there's a different approach.\n\nPerhaps there are other types of coins involved, but the problem mentions only dimes and nickels.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relationship between the number of dimes and nickels is different.\n\nWait, the problem says \"twice as many dimes as nickels,\" which clearly indicates that the number of dimes is twice the number of nickels.\n\nGiven that, and the total value being $3.95, it seems like there might be an issue because the solution isn't yielding a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the relationship.\n\nLet me try defining:\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of nickels.\n\n- Then, number of dimes is \\( 2n \\).\n\nTotal value:\n\n\\[ 0.05n + 0.10(2n) = 3.95 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.05n + 0.20n = 3.95 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.25n = 3.95 \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{3.95}{0.25} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 15.8 \\]\n\nThis persists, suggesting that perhaps the problem is misstated or there's a misunderstanding somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a need to consider pennies or other coins, but the problem specifies only dimes and nickels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationship isn't exactly twice as many dimes as nickels.\n\nWait, maybe \"twice as many dimes as nickels\" is interpreted incorrectly.\n\nLet me consider:\n\n- If she has twice as many dimes as nickels, then dimes = 2 \u00d7 nickels.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's nickels that are twice the dimes. Let me check.\n\nBut the problem says \"twice as many dimes as nickels,\" so dimes = 2 \u00d7 nickels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mishearing or misreading of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the total amount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that she has 15 nickels and 30 dimes, which would be:\n\nValue of nickels: 15 \u00d7 0.05 = 0.75\n\nValue of dimes: 30 \u00d7 0.10 = 3.00\n\nTotal: 0.75 + 3.00 = 3.75, which is less than 3.95.\n\nAlternatively, 16 nickels and 32 dimes:\n\nNickels: 16 \u00d7 0.05 = 0.80\n\nDimes: 32 \u00d7 0.10 = 3.20\n\nTotal: 0.80 + 3.20 = 4.00, which is more than 3.95.\n\nSo, 15 nickels give 3.75, 16 give 4.00, but 3.95 is in between.\n\nThis reinforces that with the constraint of dimes being twice the nickels, and only using dimes and nickels, it's not possible to reach exactly $3.95, because it would require a fraction of a nickel, which isn't practical.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there might be an error in the problem as stated. It's not possible to have a whole number of nickels and dimes, with dimes being twice the number of nickels, to total exactly $3.95.\n\nPerhaps the total amount is supposed to be $3.75, which would correspond to 15 nickels and 30 dimes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are quarters involved, but the problem specifies only dimes and nickels.\n\nGiven the constraints, the problem as stated does not have a solution with whole numbers of coins.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the problem likely contains an error.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The problem contains an error; no whole number solution exists for the given conditions.}} \\]"
