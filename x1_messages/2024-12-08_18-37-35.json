The city currently has 150 diesel buses, each with a seating capacity of 60 passengers. The new electric buses can accommodate 80 passengers each and have an initial cost of $500,000 per bus. The city wants to replace all the diesel buses within three years while maintaining the same overall passenger capacity. Calculate the number of electric buses needed, the total cost for purchasing these buses, and the annual budget required for this transition."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to replace all its diesel buses with electric ones over three years, and they want to make sure that the total passenger capacity remains the same.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total passenger capacity of the current diesel bus fleet. There are 150 diesel buses, each with a seating capacity of 60 passengers. So, the total capacity is:\n\nTotal capacity (diesel) = Number of diesel buses \u00d7 Seating capacity per diesel bus\nTotal capacity (diesel) = 150 \u00d7 60\nTotal capacity (diesel) = 9,000 passengers\n\nNow, the city wants to maintain this same overall passenger capacity with the new electric buses. Each electric bus can accommodate 80 passengers. So, to find out how many electric buses are needed, I'll divide the total required capacity by the capacity of each electric bus:\n\nNumber of electric buses needed = Total capacity (diesel) \u00f7 Seating capacity per electric bus\nNumber of electric buses needed = 9,000 \u00f7 80\nNumber of electric buses needed = 112.5\n\nSince you can't have half a bus, the city needs to purchase 113 electric buses to meet or exceed the current capacity.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total cost for purchasing these electric buses. Each electric bus costs $500,000, so:\n\nTotal cost = Number of electric buses \u00d7 Cost per electric bus\nTotal cost = 113 \u00d7 $500,000\nTotal cost = $56,500,000\n\nNow, the city wants to replace all the diesel buses within three years. To find out the annual budget required for this transition, I'll divide the total cost by the number of years:\n\nAnnual budget = Total cost \u00f7 Number of years\nAnnual budget = $56,500,000 \u00f7 3\nAnnual budget = $18,833,333.33\n\nSo, the city needs to allocate approximately $18,833,333 per year for three years to complete this transition.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total capacity of diesel buses: 150 buses \u00d7 60 passengers = 9,000 passengers. That seems correct.\n\nThen, number of electric buses needed: 9,000 \u00f7 80 = 112.5. Rounding up to 113 buses.\n\nTotal cost: 113 \u00d7 $500,000 = $56,500,000. That's right.\n\nAnnual budget: $56,500,000 \u00f7 3 = $18,833,333.33 per year.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the city could consider other factors, like the operational costs of electric buses compared to diesel buses, or any potential subsidies or incentives for switching to electric. But based on the information provided, this seems to be the straightforward calculation.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the city wants to maintain exactly the same passenger capacity. Maybe there's a possibility that the city's population or travel demand is changing, and they might need to adjust the capacity accordingly. But again, according to the question, they want to maintain the same overall passenger capacity, so my approach should be fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the timing of purchases. If they buy a certain number of buses each year, they need to make sure that the total number adds up to 113 by the end of three years. They might choose to buy more in the earlier years to phase out the diesel buses gradually.\n\nAdditionally, there might be costs associated with charging infrastructure for electric buses, which aren't accounted for in this calculation. But since the question only asks about the cost of purchasing the buses, I'll stick to that.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Number of electric buses needed: 113\n\n- Total cost for purchasing: $56,500,000\n\n- Annual budget required: Approximately $18,833,333 per year for three years\n\nI think that covers it. If there's anything else to consider, I've probably missed it, but based on the given information, this should be the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{113 \\text{ electric buses, } \\$56,500,000 \\text{ total cost, } \\$18,833,333.33 \\text{ annual budget}} \\]"
