        "content": "Let's see. So, there were originally 8 friends who planned to split the cost of a meal evenly. But then, 2 friends forgot their wallets, so only 6 friends ended up paying. Because of this, each of the 6 friends had to pay an extra $4. We need to find out how much the meal cost in total.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what happened. Originally, with 8 friends, they would each pay an equal share of the total cost, which we can call C. So, each friend was supposed to pay C/8.\n\nBut since 2 friends didn't pay, only 6 friends paid. And each of these 6 friends paid an extra $4 because there were 2 fewer payers.\n\nSo, the amount each of the 6 friends paid is C/6.\n\nAnd this amount is $4 more than what they originally planned to pay, which was C/8.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\nC/6 = C/8 + 4\n\nNow, we need to solve for C.\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 6 and 8, so the least common multiple is 24.\n\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 24 to eliminate the denominators:\n\n24 * (C/6) = 24 * (C/8 + 4)\n\nSimplify:\n\n4C = 3C + 96\n\nNow, subtract 3C from both sides:\n\n4C - 3C = 96\n\nC = 96\n\nSo, the total cost of the meal is $96.\n\nLet's check if this makes sense.\n\nOriginally, with 8 friends, each would pay 96/8 = $12.\n\nBut only 6 friends paid, and each paid an extra $4, so each paid $12 + $4 = $16.\n\nTotal paid by 6 friends: 6 * $16 = $96, which matches the total cost.\n\nLooks correct!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
