        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from City A to City B. The train goes at 60 miles per hour, and the distance between the two cities is 120 miles. But there's a twist: the train makes a stop for 15 minutes at Station X, which is exactly halfway between City A and City B. I need to figure out the total time it takes for the train to make this journey.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the time it takes to travel half the distance, since the stop is halfway. The distance from City A to Station X is half of 120 miles, so that's 60 miles. The train travels at 60 miles per hour, so time equals distance divided by speed. So, time from City A to Station X is 60 miles divided by 60 mph, which is 1 hour.\n\nThen, the train stops at Station X for 15 minutes. I need to make sure I convert this to hours since the speed is in miles per hour. 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, so that's 0.25 hours.\n\nAfter the stop, the train continues to City B, another 60 miles at 60 mph. So, again, time is 60 miles divided by 60 mph, which is another hour.\n\nNow, to get the total time, I add up the time from City A to Station X, the stop time, and the time from Station X to City B. That's 1 hour + 0.25 hours + 1 hour, which totals 2.25 hours.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps I can consider the average speed for the entire trip and then calculate the total time.\n\nIf the train travels at 60 mph for 120 miles, without any stops, it would take 2 hours. But since there's a stop of 15 minutes, the total time would be 2 hours plus 15 minutes, which is exactly what I calculated before: 2 hours and 15 minutes, or 2.25 hours.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the stop as additional time beyond the travel time. The travel time is 2 hours, and the stop adds 15 minutes, so again, 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any other factors that would affect the total time in this scenario. The train is moving at a constant speed, and the stop is a fixed amount of time.\n\nLet me consider if there's anything else I might be missing. Is there any information about the train accelerating or decelerating? No, it just says the train travels at 60 mph. So, I can assume constant speed.\n\nAlso, the stop is exactly at the halfway point, which aligns with my earlier calculation of 60 miles to Station X and another 60 miles to City B.\n\nI think the best answer is that the total time is 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Travel time from City A to Station X: 1 hour\n\n- Stop at Station X: 15 minutes\n\n- Travel time from Station X to City B: 1 hour\n\n- Total time: 2 hours and 15 minutes\n\nI'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.25 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
