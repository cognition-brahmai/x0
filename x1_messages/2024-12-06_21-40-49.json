        "content": "So, there are 8 planets in the solar system, and each planet has 4 moons. We need to find out the total number of celestial bodies, considering only planets and their moons.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many moons there are in total. If each of the 8 planets has 4 moons, then the total number of moons would be:\n\n8 planets * 4 moons per planet = 32 moons\n\nNow, we have 8 planets and 32 moons. To find the total number of celestial bodies, we just need to add these two numbers together:\n\n8 planets + 32 moons = 40 celestial bodies\n\nSo, there are 40 celestial bodies in the solar system, considering only planets and their moons.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in reality, the number of moons per planet varies. For example, Earth has only one moon, and Jupiter has many more. But according to the question, we're assuming each planet has exactly 4 moons.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the solar system includes other celestial bodies like dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets, but the question specifies that we're only counting planets and their moons.\n\nSo, based on the given information, the answer should be 40.\n\nBut let me double-check. If there are 8 planets and each has 4 moons, that's 8 * 4 = 32 moons. Plus the 8 planets themselves, that's 32 + 8 = 40.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
