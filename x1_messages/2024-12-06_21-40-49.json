They can be used for various purposes, such as gaining insight into one's current situation, understanding past experiences, exploring future possibilities, and gaining clarity on personal or professional decisions. Some people also use tarot cards for meditation, therapy, and creative inspiration. It's important to note that tarot cards are not meant to predict specific events or provide definitive answers, but rather to offer guidance and perspective based on the individual's own intuition and interpretation."
