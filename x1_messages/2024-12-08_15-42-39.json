        "content": "Let's see. So, the factory produces 500 units every 8 hours. I need to find out how many units it produces in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many 8-hour shifts there are in a day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, I can divide 24 by 8 to find the number of shifts per day.\n\n24 hours \u00f7 8 hours(shift) = 3 shifts per day\n\nSo, each day has 3 shifts.\n\nNow, if the factory produces 500 units per shift, then in one day, it would produce:\n\n500 units/shift \u00d7 3 shifts/day = 1500 units/day\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nNext, to find out the weekly production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week.\n\n1500 units/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 10,500 units/week\n\nWait, but I should double-check that.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of hours in a week and then see how many 8-hour shifts fit into that.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, so:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 168 hours/week\n\nNow, each shift is 8 hours, so the number of shifts in a week is:\n\n168 hours/week \u00f7 8 hours/shift = 21 shifts/week\n\nAnd since each shift produces 500 units:\n\n500 units/shift \u00d7 21 shifts/week = 10,500 units/week\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory produces 10,500 units in a week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any breaks or downtime in the production process. The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume the factory operates continuously without any downtime during these 8-hour shifts.\n\nAlso, I should confirm the units. The factory produces units, and the question asks for the number of units, so no need to convert to any other measure.\n\nAdditionally, I can consider the production rate per hour to cross-verify.\n\n500 units / 8 hours = 62.5 units/hour\n\nThen, in 168 hours per week:\n\n62.5 units/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = 10,500 units/week\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the daily production and then multiply by 7.\n\nAs I did earlier: 1500 units/day \u00d7 7 days = 10,500 units/week\n\nEverything points to 10,500 units per week.\n\nSo, the answer is 10,500 units per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10500} \\]"
