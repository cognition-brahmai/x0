        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of products: product A and product B. Every hour, it produces 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B. We need to find out how many units of both products will be produced in a month that has 30 days, given that the factory operates for 16 hours per day.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of hours the factory operates in a month. Since it operates 16 hours per day for 30 days, I can calculate the total operating hours by multiplying 16 by 30.\n\nTotal operating hours = 16 hours/day \u00d7 30 days\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n16 \u00d7 30 = 480 hours\n\nSo, the factory operates for 480 hours in the month.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many units of each product are produced per hour and then multiply that by the total operating hours to get the monthly production.\n\nFor product A:\n\nUnits of product A per hour = 500\n\nTotal units of product A in a month = 500 units/hour \u00d7 480 hours\n\n500 \u00d7 480 = let's see:\n\n500 \u00d7 400 = 200,000\n\n500 \u00d7 80 = 40,000\n\nSo, 200,000 + 40,000 = 240,000 units of product A\n\nFor product B:\n\nUnits of product B per hour = 300\n\nTotal units of product B in a month = 300 units/hour \u00d7 480 hours\n\n300 \u00d7 480 = \n\n300 \u00d7 400 = 120,000\n\n300 \u00d7 80 = 24,000\n\nSo, 120,000 + 24,000 = 144,000 units of product B\n\nNow, to find the total units of both products, I need to add the monthly production of product A and product B together.\n\nTotal units = units of product A + units of product B\n\nTotal units = 240,000 + 144,000 = 384,000 units\n\nWait a minute, but the question asks for the number of units of both products, which I just calculated as 384,000. But maybe they want them separately and together, so perhaps I should present both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they just want the combined total. Let me check the question again.\n\n\"How many units of both products will be produced in a month with 30 days if the factory operates for 16 hours per day?\"\n\nIt seems they want the total units of both products combined. So, 384,000 units in total.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total operating hours:\n\n16 hours/day \u00d7 30 days = 480 hours\n\nThen, product A:\n\n500 units/hour \u00d7 480 hours = 240,000 units\n\nProduct B:\n\n300 units/hour \u00d7 480 hours = 144,000 units\n\nTotal units:\n\n240,000 + 144,000 = 384,000 units\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to find the total production per hour for both products and then multiply by the total operating hours.\n\nTotal units per hour = units of product A + units of product B = 500 + 300 = 800 units/hour\n\nThen, total units in a month = 800 units/hour \u00d7 480 hours = 384,000 units\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory will produce a total of 384,000 units of both products in the month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{384000} \\]"
