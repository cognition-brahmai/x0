        "content": "So in this race, Tom finishes before Jerry, and Jerry finishes before Spike. And it's also said that no two racers finish at the same time. So, I need to figure out who finishes last.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, Tom finishes before Jerry. That means Tom's finishing time is earlier than Jerry's. Then, Jerry finishes before Spike. So, Jerry's finishing time is earlier than Spike's.\n\nSo, if I arrange them in order of finishing time, it would be Tom first, then Jerry, then Spike. Since Spike finishes after Jerry, and Jerry finishes after Tom, Spike must be the last one to finish.\n\nWait a minute, is there any possibility that someone else could finish after Spike? The problem only mentions Tom, Jerry, and Spike, and their relative finishing times. It doesn't mention any other racers. So, assuming only these three are in the race, Spike finishes last.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider if there are other racers. The problem says \"in a race, Tom finishes before Jerry, and Jerry finishes before Spike.\" It doesn't specify that there are only three racers, but it doesn't mention any others. However, in logic problems like this, if no other information is given, we usually assume only the mentioned entities are relevant unless stated otherwise.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"no two racers finish at the same time,\" which means all finishing times are unique. So, there's a clear order of finishing.\n\nGiven that Tom finishes before Jerry, and Jerry finishes before Spike, the order is Tom -> Jerry -> Spike. Therefore, Spike is the last to finish.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think about it differently. Suppose we have four racers: Tom, Jerry, Spike, and Donald. If the only information is Tom before Jerry and Jerry before Spike, then Spike is not necessarily last if Donald finishes after Spike.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't mention any other racers, I think it's safe to assume there are only Tom, Jerry, and Spike in the race.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is part of a larger context, but based on the information given, I'll proceed with the three racers.\n\nSo, in summary, Tom finishes before Jerry, Jerry finishes before Spike, and no ties. Therefore, the order is Tom, Jerry, Spike, with Spike finishing last.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Spike}} \\]"
