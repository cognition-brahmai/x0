        "content": "Let's see. I have this election problem here. There are three candidates: A, B, and C. Candidate A got 45% of the votes, candidate B got 35%, and candidate C got the remaining votes. The total number of votes cast was 8,000. I need to find out how many votes candidate C received.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what percentage of the votes candidate C received. Since the total percentage has to add up to 100%, I can subtract the percentages of candidates A and B from 100% to find C's percentage.\n\nSo, percentage for C = 100% - 45% - 35%.\n\nLet me do the math: 100 minus 45 is 55, and then 55 minus 35 is 20%. So, candidate C received 20% of the votes.\n\nNow, I need to find out what 20% of 8,000 votes is. To find a percentage of a number, I can multiply the percentage (in decimal form) by the number.\n\nFirst, convert 20% to a decimal. 20% is equal to 0.20.\n\nThen, multiply 0.20 by 8,000.\n\n0.20 \u00d7 8,000 = 1,600.\n\nSo, candidate C received 1,600 votes.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way could be to calculate the votes for candidates A and B first, then subtract those from the total votes to find C's votes.\n\nFirst, find A's votes: 45% of 8,000.\n\n45% of 8,000 is 0.45 \u00d7 8,000 = 3,600 votes.\n\nNext, B's votes: 35% of 8,000.\n\n35% of 8,000 is 0.35 \u00d7 8,000 = 2,800 votes.\n\nNow, add A and B's votes: 3,600 + 2,800 = 6,400 votes.\n\nSubtract that from the total votes to find C's votes: 8,000 - 6,400 = 1,600 votes.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, candidate C received 1,600 votes.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can check the percentages again.\n\nA: 3,600 out of 8,000 is (3,600 / 8,000) \u00d7 100% = 45%.\n\nB: 2,800 out of 8,000 is (2,800 / 8,000) \u00d7 100% = 35%.\n\nC: 1,600 out of 8,000 is (1,600 / 8,000) \u00d7 100% = 20%.\n\nEverything adds up to 100%, so I'm confident with the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1600} \\]"
