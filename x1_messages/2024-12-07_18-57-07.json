        "content": "So I need to calculate the volume of a sphere that has a radius of 4 cm. The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by V equals four-thirds times pi times the radius cubed. That is, V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Okay, let's plug in the values.\n\nFirst, the radius r is 4 cm. So, r = 4 cm.\n\nNow, r\u00b3 means r multiplied by itself three times, so 4 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 4 cm.\n\nLet me calculate that: 4 \u00d7 4 is 16, and 16 \u00d7 4 is 64. So, r\u00b3 = 64 cm\u00b3.\n\nNext, I need to multiply this by pi. Pi is approximately 3.14159.\n\nSo, 64 cm\u00b3 \u00d7 \u03c0 is 64\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nNow, I need to multiply this by four-thirds. So, V = (4/3) \u00d7 64\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nLet me compute 4/3 times 64.\n\nFirst, 4/3 \u00d7 64 = (4 \u00d7 64)/3 = 256/3.\n\n256 divided by 3 is approximately 85.333.\n\nSo, V \u2248 85.333\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nBut pi is approximately 3.14159, so let's multiply 85.333 by 3.14159.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n85.333 \u00d7 3.14159.\n\nFirst, 85 \u00d7 3.14159 is 267.53915.\n\nThen, 0.333 \u00d7 3.14159 is approximately 1.04719.\n\nAdding them together: 267.53915 + 1.04719 = 268.58634 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 268.59 cm\u00b3 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, I could have calculated it directly:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(4)^3 = (4/3)\u03c0(64) = (256/3)\u03c0.\n\nNow, 256 divided by 3 is approximately 85.333, and multiplying by \u03c0 (3.14159) gives approximately 268.0825731 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, rounding to two decimal places, V \u2248 268.08 cm\u00b3.\n\nBut earlier I had 268.59, which was a miscalculation. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a calculator for this to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me compute 256/3 first: 256 \u00f7 3 = 85.3333333.\n\nThen, 85.3333333 \u00d7 \u03c0 (3.1415926535) = 268.0825731 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, yes, V \u2248 268.08 cm\u00b3.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the exact value:\n\nV = (256/3)\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nIf I want to express it in terms of pi, that's fine, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll go with the decimal approximation.\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 268.08 cubic centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{268.08 \\text{ cm}^3} \\]"
