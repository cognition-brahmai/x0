        "content": "Let's see. So, we have four people who need to cross a bridge at night, and they only have one torch. The bridge is rickety and can only support two people at a time. Each person takes a different amount of time to cross: 1 minute, 2 minutes, 7 minutes, and 10 minutes. We need to figure out the shortest possible time for all of them to cross safely.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Only two people can cross at a time because the bridge is weak, and they need the torch to see, so only two can go together with the torch.\n\nAlso, when two people cross together, they have to move at the slower person's pace because they are walking together.\n\nAfter they cross, one person has to bring the torch back so the next pair can go. So, there's a need to minimize the time spent on returning the torch.\n\nI think the key is to make sure that the faster people are the ones returning with the torch, because they can do it quicker.\n\nLet's name the people based on their crossing times: A (1 min), B (2 mins), C (7 mins), and D (10 mins).\n\nWe want to get all four across in the least time possible.\n\nLet me try to map out a sequence of steps.\n\nFirst, A and B cross together. Since B is slower, it takes 2 minutes.\n\nNow, A or B has to bring the torch back. If B brings it back, it would take another 2 minutes, but since A is faster, it's better to have A bring it back in 1 minute.\n\nSo, total time so far: 2 (for A and B to cross) + 1 (for A to return) = 3 minutes.\n\nNow, the people on the starting side are A, C, and D.\n\nNext, we need to send two people again. Should we send C and D together? That would take 10 minutes since D is the slower one.\n\nSo, C and D cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time so far: 3 + 10 = 13 minutes.\n\nNow, someone has to bring the torch back. At this point, only B is on the other side, and A is still on the starting side with C and D.\n\nWait, no. Wait, A crossed first with B, then A came back. Then C and D crossed together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nSo, now C and D are on the other side, and A and B are there too, right? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let's recap:\n\n- Initial: A, B, C, D on start side.\n\n- Step 1: A and B cross together, taking 2 minutes. So, now on end side: A, B.\n\n- Step 2: A returns with the torch, taking 1 minute. So, now on start side: A, C, D.\n\n- Step 3: C and D cross together, taking 10 minutes. So, now on end side: C, D.\n\nWait, but A and B are already on the other side. So, now everyone is on the end side.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after step 3, C and D have crossed, so now on the end side: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, total time is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 minutes.\n\nIs this the shortest time? Maybe there's a way to do it faster.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps having the two slowest people cross together is not the best idea, because it takes 10 minutes, which is a lot.\n\nMaybe we can find a way to have the faster people shuttle the torch more efficiently.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nFirst, send A and C across. C is slower, so it takes 7 minutes.\n\nThen, A returns with the torch in 1 minute.\n\nTotal so far: 7 + 1 = 8 minutes.\n\nNow, on the start side: A, B, D.\n\nNext, send A and D across. D is slower, so it takes 10 minutes.\n\nTotal so far: 8 + 10 = 18 minutes.\n\nThis is worse than the previous plan.\n\nAlternatively, send B and C across together. C is slower, so it takes 7 minutes.\n\nThen, B returns with the torch in 2 minutes.\n\nTotal so far: 7 + 2 = 9 minutes.\n\nNow, on the start side: B, D.\n\nSend B and D across together. D is slower, so it takes 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 9 + 10 = 19 minutes.\n\nWorse than the first plan.\n\nAnother idea: send A and B across, taking 2 minutes.\n\nA returns with the torch in 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 = 3 minutes.\n\nNow, send A and C across, taking 7 minutes.\n\nTotal: 3 + 7 = 10 minutes.\n\nNow, A returns with the torch in 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 10 + 1 = 11 minutes.\n\nFinally, send A and D across, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 11 + 10 = 21 minutes.\n\nWorse again.\n\nAlternatively, after the first trip:\n\nA and B cross, 2 minutes.\n\nA returns, 1 minute. Total: 3 minutes.\n\nThen, send C and D across, 10 minutes. Total: 13 minutes.\n\nWait, this is the same as the first plan.\n\nIs there a way to overlap some of these trips?\n\nLet me think about having someone return with the torch while others are crossing.\n\nWait, no, because the torch is needed to cross, and only two people can be on the bridge at a time.\n\nAnother idea: use a relay strategy.\n\nSend A and B across, 2 minutes.\n\nA returns with the torch, 1 minute. Total: 3 minutes.\n\nNow, send A and C across, 7 minutes. Total: 3 + 7 = 10 minutes.\n\nWait, but D is still on the start side.\n\nWait, no, in this plan, after sending A and C across, D is still on the start side.\n\nWait, in the previous steps:\n\n- Initial: A, B, C, D on start.\n\n- Step 1: A and B cross, 2 minutes.\n\n- Step 2: A returns, 1 minute.\n\n- Step 3: A and C cross, 7 minutes.\n\nNow, who is on the end side: A, C.\n\nWho is on the start side: B, D.\n\nNow, need to get B and D across.\n\nSend B and D across together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 7 + 10 = 20 minutes.\n\nWorse than the first plan.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try sending A and D across first.\n\nA and D cross, taking 10 minutes.\n\nA returns with the torch, 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 10 + 1 = 11 minutes.\n\nNow, on start side: A, B, C.\n\nSend B and C across, taking 7 minutes.\n\nTotal: 11 + 7 = 18 minutes.\n\nThis is better than some previous plans, but still worse than the first plan.\n\nAnother approach: can we have someone cross multiple times?\n\nWait, no, because once someone crosses to the end side, they should stay there, as per the problem.\n\nUnless, perhaps, someone needs to come back.\n\nWait, but only to bring the torch back.\n\nI think I need to formalize this a bit.\n\nLet's consider that every time two people cross, one has to return with the torch, except for the last crossing.\n\nSo, the number of crossings is three: two people go, one comes back, two go, one comes back, and finally two go.\n\nWait, but with four people, and only one torch, and only two can cross at a time.\n\nWait, actually, in the first plan, there were two crossings where someone returned with the torch.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- Initial: A, B, C, D on start.\n\n- Step 1: A and B cross, 2 minutes.\n\n- Step 2: A returns, 1 minute.\n\n- Step 3: C and D cross, 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 minutes.\n\nEveryone is now on the end side.\n\nIs there a way to make this faster?\n\nMaybe if we can reduce the time spent on returning the torch.\n\nIn this plan, A returns twice: once after step 1, and potentially again after some other steps.\n\nWait, in the first plan, A only returns once.\n\nIs there a way to have the torch returned by a faster person?\n\nWait, in the first plan, A and B cross (2 minutes), then A returns (1 minute), then C and D cross (10 minutes).\n\nTotal: 13 minutes.\n\nWhat if, after A and B cross, B returns instead of A.\n\nSo, step 1: A and B cross, 2 minutes.\n\nStep 2: B returns with the torch, 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 4 minutes.\n\nNow, on start side: B, C, D.\n\nStep 3: C and D cross, 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 4 + 10 = 14 minutes.\n\nNow, everyone is on the end side.\n\nThis is 14 minutes, which is worse than the first plan of 13 minutes.\n\nSo, the first plan is better.\n\nIs there another way?\n\nLet me try having A and C cross first.\n\nStep 1: A and C cross, 7 minutes.\n\nStep 2: A returns with the torch, 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 8 minutes.\n\nNow, on start side: A, B, D.\n\nStep 3: A and B cross, 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 8 + 2 = 10 minutes.\n\nNow, on end side: A, B, C.\n\nOn start side: D.\n\nStep 4: A returns with the torch, 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 10 + 1 = 11 minutes.\n\nStep 5: A and D cross, 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 11 + 10 = 21 minutes.\n\nThis is worse than the first plan.\n\nAnother idea: have the fastest people make multiple trips.\n\nFor example, send A and B across, 2 minutes.\n\nThen, B returns with the torch, 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 4 minutes.\n\nNow, on start side: B, C, D.\n\nSend A and C across, 7 minutes.\n\nTotal: 4 + 7 = 11 minutes.\n\nNow, on end side: A, C.\n\nOn start side: B, D.\n\nStep 4: A returns with the torch, 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 11 + 1 = 12 minutes.\n\nStep 5: B and D cross, 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 12 + 10 = 22 minutes.\n\nStill worse than the first plan.\n\nAnother variation: send A and D across first, 10 minutes.\n\nThen, A returns with the torch, 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 11 minutes.\n\nNow, on start side: A, B, C.\n\nSend A and B across, 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 11 + 2 = 13 minutes.\n\nNow, on end side: A, B, D.\n\nOn start side: C.\n\nStep 4: A returns with the torch, 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 13 + 1 = 14 minutes.\n\nStep 5: A and C cross, 7 minutes.\n\nTotal: 14 + 7 = 21 minutes.\n\nAgain, worse than the first plan.\n\nIs there a way to have overlapping trips or have someone start crossing while others are returning?\n\nWait, no, because only two people can be on the bridge at a time, and they need the torch.\n\nI think the initial plan is the best: send the two fastest across first, have the fastest return, then send the two slowest across together.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 minutes.\n\nI can't find a way to do it faster than that.\n\nMaybe there isn't a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more optimized strategy.\n\nLet me look up similar problems.\n\nOh, I recall that this is a classic optimization problem, often called the \"bridge and torch\" problem.\n\nIn some versions, the goal is to minimize the total time for a group to cross under similar constraints.\n\nFrom what I remember, the optimal strategy involves getting the two slowest people across together, but minimizing the time spent on return trips by having the fastest people return with the torch.\n\nIn this case, the initial plan seems to align with that: send the two fastest across first, have the fastest return, then send the two slowest across together, and finally have someone return if needed.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, after sending A and B across and A returning, then sending C and D across, everyone is on the other side without needing another return trip.\n\nTotal time: 13 minutes.\n\nI think that's the minimal time required.\n\nI can't see a way to do it faster.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13}
