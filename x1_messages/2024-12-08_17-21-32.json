        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a Java application that connects to a MongoDB database, creates a collection named \"employees\", and handles employee records with fields like name, age, department, and salary. Additionally, the application should allow querying employees by department and sorting them by salary.\n\nFirst, I need to set up the environment. I'll need to include the MongoDB Java driver in my project. If I'm using Maven, I can add the dependency in the pom.xml file like this:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>\n    <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>\n    <version>4.2.3</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nNext, I need to establish a connection to the MongoDB database. I'll assume that MongoDB is running locally on the default port. Here's how I can do it:\n\n```java\nimport com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;\nimport com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;\nimport com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;\n\npublic class MongoDBConnection {\n    private static MongoClient mongoClient;\n    private static MongoDatabase database;\n\n    public static MongoDatabase connect(String db_name) {\n        mongoClient = MongoClients.create(\"mongodb://localhost:27017\");\n        database = mongoClient.getDatabase(db_name);\n        return database;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to create a collection named \"employees\". In MongoDB, collections are created automatically when you insert data into them, but I can also check if it exists beforehand.\n\nFor handling employee records, I'll create a class that represents an employee:\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private String department;\n    private double salary;\n\n    // Constructor, getters, and setters\n    public Employee(String name, int age, String department, double salary) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.department = department;\n        this.salary = salary;\n    }\n\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n```\n\nTo insert employee records into the \"employees\" collection, I'll use the MongoDB Java driver's methods to convert the Employee object to a Document and insert it.\n\n```java\nimport com.mongodb.client.MongoCollection;\nimport org.bson.Document;\n\npublic class EmployeeManager {\n    private MongoCollection<Document> employeesCollection;\n\n    public EmployeeManager(MongoDatabase database) {\n        employeesCollection = database.getCollection(\"employees\");\n    }\n\n    public void insertEmployee(Employee employee) {\n        Document doc = new Document(\"name\", employee.getName())\n                .append(\"age\", employee.getAge())\n                .append(\"department\", employee.getDepartment())\n                .append(\"salary\", employee.getSalary());\n        employeesCollection.insertOne(doc);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor querying employees by department and sorting them by salary, I'll use the find method with a filter for the department and then sort the results by salary.\n\n```java\nimport com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts;\nimport com.mongodb.client.FindIterable;\nimport org.bson.Document;\n\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\npublic class EmployeeQuery {\n    private MongoCollection<Document> employeesCollection;\n\n    public EmployeeQuery(MongoDatabase database) {\n        employeesCollection = database.getCollection(\"employees\");\n    }\n\n    public void getEmployeesByDepartmentSortedBySalary(String department) {\n        FindIterable<Document> iterable = employeesCollection.find(new Document(\"department\", department)).sort(Sorts.ascending(\"salary\"));\n        Iterator<Document> iterator = iterable.iterator();\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            Document doc = iterator.next();\n            System.out.println(doc.toJson());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, I'll create a main class to tie everything together. It will connect to the database, insert some employee records, and then query them by department and sort by salary.\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        MongoDatabase database = MongoDBConnection.connect(\"employeeDB\");\n        EmployeeManager manager = new EmployeeManager(database);\n        EmployeeQuery query = new EmployeeQuery(database);\n\n        // Inserting employees\n        manager.insertEmployee(new Employee(\"John Doe\", 30, \"HR\", 50000));\n        manager.insertEmployee(new Employee(\"Jane Smith\", 25, \"IT\", 60000));\n        manager.insertEmployee(new Employee(\"Alice Johnson\", 35, \"HR\", 55000));\n        manager.insertEmployee(new Employee(\"Bob Brown\", 40, \"IT\", 70000));\n\n        // Querying employees by department and sorting by salary\n        System.out.println(\"Employees in HR department sorted by salary:\");\n        query.getEmployeesByDepartmentSortedBySalary(\"HR\");\n\n        System.out.println(\"Employees in IT department sorted by salary:\");\n        query.getEmployeesByDepartmentSortedBySalary(\"IT\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements. The application connects to a MongoDB database, creates a collection, inserts employee records, and provides functionality to query employees by department and sort them by salary.\n\n**Note:** Error handling and other optimizations can be added as per requirements. Also, ensure that the MongoDB server is running and accessible at the specified URL and port."
