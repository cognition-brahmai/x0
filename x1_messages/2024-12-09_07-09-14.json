        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a group G of order p\u00b2, where p is a prime number. We need to show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nFirst off, I know that the order of a group is the number of its elements. Since the order is p\u00b2, and p is prime, this should give us some clues about the structure of G.\n\nI recall that by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. So, possible orders of subgroups are 1, p, and p\u00b2.\n\nAlso, I think Sylow's theorems might be relevant here, but since the order of G is p\u00b2, it's a p-group, so maybe we can use some properties of p-groups.\n\nLet me start by considering the center of the group, Z(G). I know that for any group, the center is a subgroup consisting of all elements that commute with every element in the group.\n\nThere's a theorem that says that the center of a p-group is non-trivial. Wait, is that true? Let me think. Yes, in a p-group, the center cannot be just the identity; it must have at least p elements. So, |Z(G)| is either p or p\u00b2.\n\nCase 1: |Z(G)| = p\u00b2\n\nIf the center has p\u00b2 elements, that means Z(G) = G. So, G is abelian.\n\nIn an abelian group, every element commutes with every other element. Now, in an abelian group of order p\u00b2, what are the possible structures?\n\nWell, by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nIn this case, since the order is p\u00b2, the possible structures are:\n\n1. A single cyclic group of order p\u00b2, which is Z_{p\u00b2}.\n\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, which is Z_p \u00d7 Z_p.\n\nSo, in this case, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to Z_p \u00d7 Z_p.\n\nCase 2: |Z(G)| = p\n\nNow, if the center has order p, then it's a subgroup of G with p elements. Since G is a p-group, we can consider the quotient group G/Z(G). The order of G/Z(G) would be |G| / |Z(G)| = p\u00b2 / p = p.\n\nSo, G/Z(G) is a group of order p, which is prime. We know that any group of prime order is cyclic. Therefore, G/Z(G) is cyclic.\n\nThere's a theorem that says if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is abelian. Wait, but in this case, G is already a p-group, and we're in case 2 where Z(G) has order p, so G is not fully abelian because if it were, Z(G) would be G.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me check.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem that says if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is abelian. So, if G/Z(G) is cyclic, that would imply G is abelian, but in this case, we're assuming that Z(G) has order p, and G has order p\u00b2, so G is abelian only if Z(G) = G, which is case 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering the theorem. Let me look it up.\n\nOkay, I found that if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is abelian. So, in this case, since G/Z(G) is cyclic of order p, that would imply G is abelian, but that contradicts our assumption that Z(G) has order p, because if G is abelian, then Z(G) = G, which has order p\u00b2.\n\nSo, maybe this case can't happen, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the class equation. For a p-group, the class equation is |G| = |Z(G)| + \u2211 [G:C(x)], where the sum is over representatives x of the non-central conjugacy classes, and C(x) is the centralizer of x in G.\n\nSince G is a p-group, the order of each [G:C(x)] is a multiple of p, but less than |G|, so they must be p or p\u00b2. But since x is not in Z(G), C(x) is properly contained in G, so [G:C(x)] is at least p.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me consider the number of elements of order p in G.\n\nIn case 1, where G is abelian, we've already seen that G is either cyclic or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nIn case 2, where |Z(G)| = p, I need to see if G can still be expressed in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a p-group, there exists an element of order p, and build subgroups from there.\n\nWait, actually, in any group of order p\u00b2, since p is prime, by Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element of order p.\n\nLet me consider the possible structures again.\n\nIf G has an element of order p\u00b2, then G is cyclic, generated by that element.\n\nIf not, then all non-identity elements of G have order p.\n\nIn this case, since G is a p-group, it has a non-trivial center, as we've established.\n\nIf G has exponent p, meaning that every element satisfies x^p = e, then G is an elementary abelian p-group, which is isomorphic to Z_p \u00d7 Z_p.\n\nAlternatively, if G has an element of order p\u00b2, it's cyclic.\n\nSo, in summary, G is either cyclic or elementary abelian of order p\u00b2.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered the center having order p or p\u00b2.\n\nIf G is abelian, then G is either cyclic or Z_p \u00d7 Z_p.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then |Z(G)| = p.\n\nBut in the case where |Z(G)| = p, and G is non-abelian, is that possible?\n\nWait a minute, in a p-group, if G is non-abelian, can |Z(G)| = p?\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nActually, for a group of order p\u00b2, it's a known result that such a group is always abelian.\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nLet me check.\n\nTake p = 2, so order 4.\n\nThe groups of order 4 are C4 (cyclic) and V4 (Klein four-group), both of which are abelian.\n\nFor p = 3, order 9, there are two groups: C9 and C3 \u00d7 C3, both abelian.\n\nSimilarly, for any prime p, groups of order p\u00b2 are abelian.\n\nWait, but I thought there could be non-abelian groups of order p\u00b2.\n\nAm I missing something here?\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nUpon checking, it turns out that all groups of order p\u00b2 are abelian. So, there are no non-abelian groups of order p\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, in this case, G must be abelian, and by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, it is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_{p\u00b2}) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p (Z_p \u00d7 Z_p).\n\nThus, we have shown that any group of order p\u00b2 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Any group of order } p^2 \\text{ is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order } p.}"
