        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a man with 53 socks in his drawer: 21 blue, 15 black, and 17 red. The room is dark, so he can't see the colors, and he needs to pick some socks to make sure he has at least one matching pair. The question is, how many socks must he take to be sure of that?\n\nOkay, let's think about this. The key here is that he wants to be sure he has at least one matching pair. So, he needs at least two socks of the same color.\n\nFirst, I should consider the worst-case scenario. What's the worst that could happen when he picks socks randomly in the dark?\n\nWell, the worst case would be that he picks one sock of each color first. So, he could pick one blue, one black, and one red sock. That's three socks, all different colors.\n\nNow, if he picks a fourth sock, no matter what color it is, it has to match one of the first three because there are only three colors available.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- If the fourth sock is blue, it matches the first blue sock.\n\n- If it's black, it matches the black one.\n\n- If it's red, it matches the red one.\n\nTherefore, by picking four socks, he ensures that at least two of them are the same color.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that he could get more than three socks without having a matching pair? Let's see.\n\nIf he picks three socks, each of a different color, then the fourth one must match one of them. So, four socks should be enough.\n\nBut let's think about it another way. Suppose he picks all the socks one by one.\n\n- First sock: any color, say blue.\n\n- Second sock: could be another blue, or black, or red.\n\n- If it's another blue, he already has a pair.\n\n- If it's black, now he has one blue and one black.\n\n- Third sock: could be blue, black, or red.\n\n- If it's blue, he has two blue and one black.\n\n- If it's black, he has one blue and two black.\n\n- If it's red, he has one blue, one black, and one red.\n\n- Fourth sock: now, regardless of the color, it will match one of the existing colors.\n\nSo, in the worst case, he picks one of each color first, and the fourth one matches one of them.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, the \"containers\" are the colors, and the \"items\" are the socks.\n\nThere are three colors (blue, black, red), so if he picks four socks, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must have at least two socks.\n\nTherefore, he needs to pick four socks to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's a scenario where he picks more than four socks but still doesn't have a matching pair.\n\nWell, that's not possible because with four socks, even in the worst case, he has to have at least one pair.\n\nWait, what if he picks three socks of different colors and then a fourth sock that matches one of them? That's the scenario I already considered.\n\nAlternatively, if he picks two socks of one color and then two of another color, he still has at least one matching pair.\n\nBut the question is about the minimum number of socks he must take to be sure he has at least one matching pair.\n\nSo, if he picks two socks, it's possible that they are of different colors, so he doesn't have a pair.\n\nIf he picks three socks, it's still possible that they are all different colors, but in this case, since there are only three colors, picking four socks ensures that at least two are the same color.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be four socks.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nSuppose there are 21 blue, 15 black, and 17 red socks.\n\nIf he picks three socks, he could have one blue, one black, and one red.\n\nThen, the fourth sock he picks must be either blue, black, or red, thus matching one of the existing socks.\n\nSo, in all possibilities, picking four socks ensures at least one pair.\n\nTherefore, the man must take at least four socks to be sure he has at least one matching pair.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
