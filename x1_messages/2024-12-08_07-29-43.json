It has helped me understand that while we may be small in the grand scheme of the universe, we are not insignificant. Every star, every planet, every galaxy has a part to play, just as we do. This belief is what drives my passion as an astrologer.\nJoseph: What is the most fascinating thing you've learned about the celestial bodies?"
