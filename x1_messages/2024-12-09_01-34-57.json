I've got a stack of reports here that suggest things didn't quite go according to plan.\n\n**James Bond:** Always a pleasure to brief you, M. The mission was to retrieve a stolen quantum encryption device from a criminal syndicate in Istanbul. Initial intelligence pointed to a straightforward extraction, but as usual, complications arose.\n\n**M:** Complications? Like what?\n\n**James Bond:** Well, the syndicate leader turned out to be more connected than we anticipated. He had ties to a higher echelon of criminals, possibly even state-sponsored elements.\n\n**M:** State-sponsored? This is getting interesting. Did you manage to confirm that?\n\n**James Bond:** I did manage to intercept some communications that suggest they're working with a rogue nation looking to exploit the encryption technology for their own gain.\n\n**M:** And the device? Did you retrieve it?\n\n**James Bond:** Yes, but not without a fight. There was a security breach at the location, and I had to think on my feet to get it out unnoticed.\n\n**M:** Unnoticed? From what I hear, there was quite a commotion.\n\n**James Bond:** Let's just say I left a memorable impression. But the device is secure, and I have it here.\n\n**M:** Good work, 007. Now, about the... collateral damage. Reports indicate that several individuals were... eliminated during your extraction.\n\n**James Bond:** In the line of duty, M. Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made to protect national security.\n\n**M:** I understand that, Bond. But we need to be cautious. Public perception is delicate, especially with international operations. We don't want another media circus like last time.\n\n**James Bond:** Understood, M. I'll be more discreet in the future.\n\n**M:** See that you are. Now, regarding the rogue nation involvement, I want you to dig deeper. Find out who they are and what their endgame is. This could be bigger than we think.\n\n**James Bond:** Will do, M. Any particular leads or assets I should be aware of?\n\n**M:** I'll have Q brief you on any relevant intelligence. In the meantime, take some time to debrief and recuperate. You look... tired.\n\n**James Bond:** Just a few bumps and bruises, M. Nothing a bit of rest won't fix.\n\n**M:** Very well. Dismissed, 007.\n\n**James Bond:** Thank you, M. **"
