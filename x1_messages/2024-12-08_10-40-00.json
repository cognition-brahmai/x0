        "content": "So, I've got this question here: On average, a human being blinks once every 4 seconds. How many times does a person blink in an hour? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many blinks happen in one hour based on a blinking rate of once every 4 seconds.\n\nI know that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, to find the total number of seconds in an hour, I can multiply 60 seconds by 60 minutes.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n60 seconds/minute \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 3,600 seconds/hour\n\nSo, there are 3,600 seconds in one hour.\n\nNow, if a person blinks once every 4 seconds, I need to find out how many 4-second intervals there are in 3,600 seconds.\n\nTo do that, I can divide the total number of seconds in an hour by the blinking interval.\n\nSo, 3,600 seconds \u00f7 4 seconds/blink = 900 blinks/hour\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 \u00d7 60 = 3,600 seconds in an hour. That seems right.\n\nThen, blinking once every 4 seconds means that every 4 seconds, there's one blink.\n\nSo, to find the number of blinks in an hour, I divide the total seconds in an hour by the blinking interval.\n\n3,600 \u00f7 4 = 900.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could find out how many blinks occur in one second and then scale it up to an hour.\n\nIf a person blinks once every 4 seconds, then the blinking rate is 1 blink every 4 seconds, which is equivalent to 1/4 blinks per second.\n\nSo, 1/4 blinks/second.\n\nNow, to find out how many blinks in an hour, I can multiply this rate by the total number of seconds in an hour.\n\nSo, (1/4 blinks/second) \u00d7 3,600 seconds/hour.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(1/4) \u00d7 3,600 = 3,600 / 4 = 900 blinks/hour.\n\nAgain, I get 900 blinks per hour.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nLet me consider another way to verify this.\n\nSuppose I want to find out how many blinks occur in a minute first, and then scale it up to an hour.\n\nFirst, find the number of seconds in a minute: 60 seconds.\n\nThen, number of blinks in a minute would be 60 seconds \u00f7 4 seconds/blink = 15 blinks/minute.\n\nNow, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 blinks/minute \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 900 blinks/hour.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlright, I think it's consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for.\n\nIs the blinking rate constant throughout the hour? Probably not, but according to the problem, the average blinking rate is once every 4 seconds, so I think it's acceptable to use this average rate for the calculation.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct units and that I'm not missing anything in the conversion.\n\nSeconds to minutes to hours: that seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I think 900 blinks per hour is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me try one more approach.\n\nLet's think in terms of rates.\n\nThe blinking rate is 1 blink every 4 seconds, which is equivalent to 0.25 blinks per second.\n\nNow, over the course of an hour, which is 3,600 seconds, the total number of blinks would be the blinking rate multiplied by the total time.\n\nSo, 0.25 blinks/second \u00d7 3,600 seconds = 900 blinks.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that a person blinks 900 times in an hour, given the average blinking rate of once every 4 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
