        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 10 red balls, 15 blue balls, and 20 green balls. That means the total number of balls is 10 + 15 + 20, which is 45 balls. The question is asking for the probability of drawing one ball of each color when you draw three balls without replacement.\n\nOkay, so first things first, since we're drawing without replacement, the order in which we draw the balls matters in terms of how the probabilities change with each draw. But actually, in probability calculations for combinations, the order doesn't matter as long as we consider the total number of ways to draw the desired outcome compared to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw any three balls out of 45 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Here, n = 45 and k = 3.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(45, 3) = 45! / (3!(45 - 3)!) = (45 \u00d7 44 \u00d7 43) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (45 \u00d7 44 \u00d7 43) / 6.\n\nI can calculate that step by step:\n\n45 \u00d7 44 = 1980\n\n1980 \u00d7 43 = let's see, 2000 \u00d7 43 would be 86,000, minus 20 \u00d7 43, which is 860, so 86,000 - 860 = 85,140\n\nThen, 85,140 / 6 = 14,190.\n\nSo, there are 14,190 possible ways to draw any three balls from the bag.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to draw one ball of each color. That means one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red ball from 10 is C(10, 1) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one blue ball from 15 is C(15, 1) = 15.\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one green ball from 20 is C(20, 1) = 20.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose one ball of each color, we multiply these together:\n\n10 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 20 = 3,000.\n\nSo, there are 3,000 favorable outcomes.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThat is, Probability = 3,000 / 14,190.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nFirst, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 10:\n\n300 / 1,419.\n\nNow, let's see if 300 and 1,419 have any common factors.\n\n300 is divisible by 3 (3 \u00d7 100 = 300), and 1,419 divided by 3 is 473 (since 3 \u00d7 473 = 1,419).\n\nSo, 300 \u00f7 3 = 100, and 1,419 \u00f7 3 = 473.\n\nNow we have 100 / 473.\n\nLet's check if 100 and 473 have any common factors.\n\n100 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5, and 473 is 11 \u00d7 43. No common factors there.\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 100 / 473.\n\nTo get a decimal, we can divide 100 by 473.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n473 goes into 100 zero times. So, 0 point something.\n\n473 goes into 1000 two times (since 473 \u00d7 2 = 946), subtract that from 1000, gets 54.\n\nBring down a zero, makes it 540.\n\n473 goes into 540 once (473 \u00d7 1 = 473), subtract that, gets 67.\n\nBring down a zero, makes it 670.\n\n473 goes into 670 once again (473 \u00d7 1 = 473), subtract, gets 197.\n\nBring down a zero, makes it 1,970.\n\n473 goes into 1,970 four times (473 \u00d7 4 = 1,892), subtract, gets 78.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, approximately, 100 / 473 is roughly 0.211, or 21.1%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing one ball of each color when drawing three balls without replacement is about 21.1%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the probability step by step, considering that we're drawing without replacement.\n\nSo, first draw: probability of drawing any color is 1, since no restrictions.\n\nBut to make it\u6709\u5e8f, let's consider a specific order, say red, then blue, then green.\n\nProbability of first drawing a red ball: 10 red / 45 total = 10/45 = 2/9.\n\nThen, second draw: now there are 44 balls left, 15 blue balls.\n\nProbability of drawing a blue ball: 15/44.\n\nThird draw: now 43 balls left, 20 green balls.\n\nProbability of drawing a green ball: 20/43.\n\nSo, the probability for this specific sequence (red, then blue, then green) is (2/9) \u00d7 (15/44) \u00d7 (20/43).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 2/9 \u00d7 15/44 = (2 \u00d7 15) / (9 \u00d7 44) = 30 / 396 = 5 / 66.\n\nThen, 5/66 \u00d7 20/43 = (5 \u00d7 20) / (66 \u00d7 43) = 100 / 2838.\n\nSimplify 100/2838 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 50/1419.\n\nWait, earlier I had 100/473, but now I have 50/1419. What's going on?\n\nAh, I see. In the first method, I considered combinations, where order doesn't matter. In this second method, I considered a specific order.\n\nBut actually, there are different orders in which we can draw one of each color. For example, red-blue-green, red-green-blue, blue-red-green, blue-green-red, green-red-blue, green-blue-red.\n\nSo, there are 3! = 6 possible orders.\n\nSo, the total probability should be 6 \u00d7 (50/1419) = 300/1419.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 3000/14190, which simplifies to 100/473.\n\nWait, 300/1419 simplifies to:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 100/473.\n\nOkay, so both methods give the same result: 100/473, or approximately 21.1%.\n\nSo, the probability is 100/473, or about 21.1%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{100}{473}} \\]"
