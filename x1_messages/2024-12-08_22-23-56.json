        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to distribute 12 identical candies among 4 children, and each child has to get at least 2 candies. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, since the candies are identical, the order in which I give them to the children doesn't matter. It's all about how many each child gets, right? So, this sounds like a problem of distributing indistinct objects into distinct groups.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, there's a formula for distributing n identical items among r distinct groups, and it's given by the binomial coefficient C(n + r - 1, r - 1). But wait, that's when there are no restrictions on how many items each group gets, including the possibility of getting zero.\n\nIn this case, though, each child must get at least 2 candies. So, I need to adjust for that restriction.\n\nMaybe I can start by giving each child 2 candies to satisfy the minimum requirement. Since there are 4 children, that means I've already given out 8 candies (2 per child). Now, I have 12 - 8 = 4 candies left to distribute without any restrictions.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to distributing these remaining 4 identical candies among the 4 children, where each child can get zero or more candies.\n\nAlright, so now I can apply that formula I mentioned earlier. Here, n = 4 candies, and r = 4 children.\n\nSo, the number of ways is C(4 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(7, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that. C(7, 3) is 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)! ) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (3! * 4! ) = (7 * 6 * 5) / 6 = 35.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is there another way to think about this to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as solving the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 12, where each xi >= 2.\n\nBy making the substitution yi = xi - 2, where yi >= 0, the equation becomes (y1 + 2) + (y2 + 2) + (y3 + 2) + (y4 + 2) = 12, which simplifies to y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 = 12 - 8 = 4.\n\nNow, it's about finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 = 4, which is indeed C(4 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(7, 3) = 35.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this to ensure I'm not missing something?\n\nPerhaps I can consider the stars and bars method. I've heard of that in combinatorics. The stars represent the candies, and the bars represent dividers between the different children.\n\nSo, for 4 children, I need 3 bars to separate their shares.\n\nTherefore, the total number of symbols is 4 candies (stars) + 3 bars = 7 symbols.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these is C(7, 3), which again is 35.\n\nAlright, multiple methods are leading me to the same answer, which is a good sign.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any limitations or special cases I should consider.\n\nFor example, is there a maximum number of candies a child can receive? The problem doesn't specify any upper limit, so I assume there isn't one.\n\nAlso, are the candies distinct in any way? No, they're identical.\n\nAre the children distinct? Yes, they are different children.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out all possible distributions manually, but that would be time-consuming for larger numbers, but since the remaining candies are only 4, I could do it for verification.\n\nLet's list all possible non-negative integer solutions to y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 = 4.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- All 4 candies to one child: (4,0,0,0) and permutations. There are C(4,1) = 4 ways.\n\n- 3 candies to one child, 1 to another: (3,1,0,0) and permutations. There are C(4,1) * C(3,1) = 12 ways.\n\n- 2 candies to one child, 2 to another: (2,2,0,0) and permutations. There are C(4,2) = 6 ways.\n\n- 2 candies to one child, 1 to another, 1 to another: (2,1,1,0) and permutations. There are C(4,1) * C(3,2) = 12 ways.\n\n- All children get 1 candy: (1,1,1,1), which is 1 way.\n\nAdding these up: 4 + 12 + 6 + 12 + 1 = 35 ways.\n\nPerfect, this matches my previous calculations.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to distribute 12 identical candies among 4 children, with each child getting at least 2 candies, is 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
