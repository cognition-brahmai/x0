        "content": "I've got this task to list 11 words that contain \"ele\" somewhere in them. Okay, let's see. I'll try to think of a variety of words from different categories to make it interesting.\n\nFirst off, \"element.\" That's a good one. In science, an element is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. There are elements like hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and so on.\n\nNext, \"elephant.\" Everyone knows what an elephant is\u2014it's a large mammal with a trunk and big ears. They're intelligent animals and are found in Africa and Asia.\n\nThen, \"elevate.\" To elevate something means to raise it to a higher position or level. It can be used literally, like elevating a patient's foot, or figuratively, like elevating someone's mood.\n\n\"Elective.\" This term is used in education to refer to courses that students can choose to take, as opposed to required courses. It's also used in politics to describe offices that are filled by election rather than appointment.\n\n\"Elemental.\" This word refers to something that relates to the basic or essential parts of something. In mythology, elemental beings are often associated with the classical elements like earth, air, fire, and water.\n\n\"Electrolyte.\" In chemistry, an electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity when dissolved in water or melted. They are important in many biological processes and are often replenished after exercise.\n\n\"Eleventh.\" This is the ordinal number following the tenth. For example, the eleventh month of the year is November.\n\n\"Eliminate.\" To eliminate something means to remove it or get rid of it. It can be used in various contexts, such as eliminating a competitor in a game or eliminating a disease.\n\n\"Elective.\" Wait, I already have \"elective.\" Maybe I should think of another word starting with \"ele.\"\n\nHow about \"elegy?\" An elegy is a poem or song composed in honor of a deceased person, expressing grief or lamentation.\n\n\"Elementary.\" This word refers to something that is basic or fundamental. In education, elementary school is the initial stage of schooling, typically for young children.\n\n\"Electoral.\" This term is related to elections or the process of electing someone to office. For example, electoral college or electoral reform.\n\nLet me see if I have 11 words here:\n\n1. Element\n\n2. Elephant\n\n3. Elevate\n\n4. Elective\n\n5. Elemental\n\n6. Electrolyte\n\n7. Eleventh\n\n8. Eliminate\n\n9. Elegy\n\n10. Elementary\n\n11. Electoral\n\nYes, that's 11 words. I think that covers it. If you need more or have any specific category in mind, let me know!\n\n**Final List:**\n\n1. Element\n\n2. Elephant\n\n3. Elevate\n\n4. Elective\n\n5. Elemental\n\n6. Electrolyte\n\n7. Eleventh\n\n8. Eliminate\n\n9. Elegy\n\n10. Elementary\n\n11. Electoral"
