        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if a circle has an area of 50 square inches, what's its circumference? Hmm, I remember that the area of a circle is related to its radius, and the circumference is also related to the radius. Let me see how to connect these things.\n\nFirst, the formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where A is the area and r is the radius. And the circumference is C = 2\u03c0r. So, if I know the area, I can find the radius, and then use that to find the circumference.\n\nGiven that the area is 50 square inches, so A = 50. Plugging that into the area formula:\n\n50 = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to solve for r. I can do this by dividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\n50/\u03c0 = r\u00b2\n\nThen, take the square root of both sides to solve for r:\n\nr = \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nOkay, now that I have the radius, I can plug it into the circumference formula:\n\nC = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it. Let me see:\n\nFirst, \u221a(50/\u03c0) can be written as \u221a50 / \u221a\u03c0.\n\nSo, C = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a50 / \u221a\u03c0) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a50) / (\u221a\u03c0)\n\nNow, I can write \u03c0 as \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a\u03c0, so:\n\nC = 2 * (\u221a\u03c0 * \u221a\u03c0) * (\u221a50) / (\u221a\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a50 / \u221a\u03c0\n\nSimplify by canceling one \u221a\u03c0 in numerator and denominator:\n\nC = 2 * \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a50\n\nBut \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a50 = \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nSo, C = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to simplify this. Let me try calculating the numerical value.\n\nFirst, calculate r = \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nLet's use \u03c0 approximately equal to 3.1416.\n\nSo, r = \u221a(50 / 3.1416) = \u221a(15.9155) \u2248 3.99 inches\n\nThen, circumference C = 2\u03c0r \u2248 2 * 3.1416 * 3.99 \u2248 25.13 inches\n\nWait, but I think I should keep it in terms of \u03c0 for more accuracy.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nC = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nI can write this as C = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a50\n\nWait, is that right? Let's check:\n\nC = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50)\n\nWait, no, that's not helping.\n\nAlternatively, C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50)\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nStarting from A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = 50\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = 50/\u03c0\n\nAnd C = 2\u03c0r\n\nI can express C in terms of A:\n\nC = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(A/\u03c0) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nNow, let's simplify \u221a(50/\u03c0):\n\n\u221a(50/\u03c0) = \u221a50 / \u221a\u03c0\n\nSo, C = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a50 / \u221a\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a50 * (\ufffd\u03c0 / \u221a\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a50 * \u221a\u03c0\n\nWait, \u03c0 / \u221a\u03c0 = \u221a\u03c0\n\nSo, C = 2 * \u221a50 * \u221a\u03c0 = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, 2 * \u221a50 * \u221a\u03c0 = 2 * \u221a(25 * 2 * \u03c0) = 2 * 5 * \u221a(2\u03c0) = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, \u221a50 = \u221a(25*2) = 5\u221a2\n\nSo, C = 2 * 5\u221a2 * \u221a\u03c0 = 10 * \u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nOkay, so C = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, if I want a numerical value, I can calculate \u221a(2\u03c0) with \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416:\n\n\u221a(2 * 3.1416) = \u221a6.2832 \u2248 2.5066\n\nThen, C \u2248 10 * 2.5066 \u2248 25.066 inches\n\nBut I think the exact answer is preferred, so C = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nWait, but earlier I got C = 25.13 inches using approximation. Let me check if 10\u221a(2\u03c0) equals that.\n\nCalculate 10 * \u221a(2 * 3.1416) = 10 * \u221a6.2832 \u2248 10 * 2.5066 = 25.066 inches\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more simplified exact form.\n\nLet me see:\n\nC = 2\u03c0r and A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = 50\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = 50/\u03c0, r = \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nThen, C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50)\n\nWait, I'm back to the same place.\n\nAlternatively, C = 2\u03c0r and A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = 50, so r = \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nThus, C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50)\n\nAlternatively, C = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, factor out perfect squares:\n\n50\u03c0 = 25 * 2\u03c0, so \u221a(50\u03c0) = \u221a(25 * 2\u03c0) = 5\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nTherefore, C = 2 * 5\u221a(2\u03c0) = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nWait, that's what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express it as C = \u221a(4\u03c0 * 50\u03c0) = \u221a(200\u03c0\u00b2) = \u221a200 * \u03c0 = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, \u221a(4\u03c0 * 50\u03c0) = \u221a(200\u03c0\u00b2) = \u221a200 * \u03c0 = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nBut that would be C = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nBut earlier, using C = 2\u03c0r and r = \u221a(50/\u03c0), I got C = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nThese seem different.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nC = 10\u221a(2\u03c0) vs. C = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nNo, those are different.\n\nLet me calculate both:\n\n10\u221a(2\u03c0) = 10 * \u221a(2 * 3.1416) \u2248 10 * \u221a6.2832 \u2248 10 * 2.5066 \u2248 25.066 inches\n\n10\u221a2 * \u03c0 \u2248 10 * 1.4142 * 3.1416 \u2248 44.428 inches\n\nThat's not matching. So, I must have made a mistake in one of these steps.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nStarting from C = 2\u03c0r and r = \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nSo, C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nNow, \u221a(50\u03c0) = \u221a(25 * 2 * \u03c0) = 5\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nTherefore, C = 2 * 5\u221a(2\u03c0) = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50)/\u221a\u03c0 = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a50)/\u221a\u03c0 = 2 * \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a50 = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nWhich again is C = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0) = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me recall that C = 2\u03c0r and A = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\nSo, C = 2\u03c0r and A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = 50\n\nFrom A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = 50, r\u00b2 = 50/\u03c0, r = \u221a(50/\u03c0)\n\nThen, C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, C = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express C in terms of A.\n\nSince A = \u03c0r\u00b2, and C = 2\u03c0r, then r = \u221a(A/\u03c0), so C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(A/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * A / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0A)\n\nSo, C = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0A)\n\nGiven A = 50, C = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nWhich matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, C = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, factor 50 as 25 * 2, so \u221a(50\u03c0) = \u221a(25 * 2\u03c0) = 5\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nTherefore, C = 2 * 5\u221a(2\u03c0) = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nSo, C = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nThat seems to be the simplified exact form.\n\nAlternatively, if I want a numerical value, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416:\n\nC \u2248 10 * \u221a(2 * 3.1416) = 10 * \u221a6.2832 \u2248 10 * 2.5066 \u2248 25.066 inches\n\nAlternatively, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, for more precision:\n\nC \u2248 10 * \u221a(2 * 3.1415926535) = 10 * \u221a6.283185307 \u2248 10 * 2.5066282746 \u2248 25.066282746 inches\n\nSo, approximately 25.07 inches.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it in terms of \u03c0, as 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nAlternatively, rationalize it differently.\n\nWait, maybe I can express it as C = \u221a(4\u03c0 * 50\u03c0) = \u221a(200\u03c0\u00b2)\n\nWait, that's not correct.\n\nBecause C = 2\u03c0r and r = \u221a(50/\u03c0), so C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nThat's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write C = \u221a(4\u03c0 * 50\u03c0) = \u221a(200\u03c0\u00b2) = \u221a200 * \u03c0 = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nBut that's different from what I had earlier, and numerically it doesn't match.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nC = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write C = \u221a(4\u03c0 * 50\u03c0) = \u221a(200\u03c0\u00b2) = \u221a200 * \u03c0 = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nBut that would be C = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0, which numerically is about 10 * 1.4142 * 3.1416 \u2248 44.428 inches, which doesn't match the earlier approximation of 25.07 inches.\n\nSo, that must be wrong.\n\nLet me see where I made a mistake.\n\nStarting from C = 2\u03c0r and r = \u221a(50/\u03c0), so C = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0\u00b2 * 50 / \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write C = \u221a(4\u03c0 * 50\u03c0) = \u221a(200\u03c0\u00b2) = \u221a200 * \u03c0 = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nBut that's not equal to 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0). Let's check:\n\n2 * \u221a(50\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(25 * 2\u03c0) = 2 * 5 * \u221a(2\u03c0) = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nWhile 10\u221a2 * \u03c0 = 10 * \u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nThese are different.\n\nSo, the correct expression is C = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nTherefore, the circumference is 10\u221a(2\u03c0) inches.\n\nAlternatively, if a numerical approximation is needed, it's approximately 25.07 inches.\n\nBut since the problem gives the area as 50 square inches, which is a precise value, perhaps the answer should be in terms of \u03c0.\n\nHowever, \u221a(2\u03c0) is not a standard simplification, so maybe leaving it as C = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0) is better.\n\nAlternatively, rationalizing it differently:\n\nC = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0) = 2 * \u221a(25 * 2\u03c0) = 2 * 5 * \u221a(2\u03c0) = 10\u221a(2\u03c0)\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expressing it as C = \u221a(4 * 50\u03c0\u00b2) = \u221a(200\u03c0\u00b2) = \u221a200 * \u03c0 = 10\u221a2 * \u03c0\n\nWait, that's different from before.\n\nWait, C = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(50/\u03c0) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a50)/\u221a\u03c0 = 2 * \u03c0 * \u221a50 / \u221a\u03c0 = 2 * \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a50 / \u221a\u03c0 = 2 * \u221a\u03c0 * \u221a50 = 2 * \u221a(\u03c0 * 50) = 2 * \u221a(50\u03c0)\n\nThis matches the earlier expression.\n\nTherefore, C = 10\u221a(2\u03c0) inches.\n\nI think that's the most simplified exact form.\n\nSo, the circumference is 10\u221a(2\u03c0) inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\]\n"
