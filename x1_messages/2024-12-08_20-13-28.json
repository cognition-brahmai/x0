        "content": "Hmm, that's an interesting riddle. Let's see if I can figure it out. So, \"at night I come without being fetched.\" That suggests something that appears naturally at night, without anyone having to go get it. Maybe like darkness or something.\n\nAnd then, \"by day I am lost without being stolen.\" So, during the day, this thing disappears or is no longer present, but it's not because someone took it. It just naturally isn't there anymore.\n\nCombining both parts, it seems like the answer is \"shadow.\" At night, shadows appear because of the lack of light, and during the day, shadows are less prominent or disappear as there's more light, but no one has stolen them; they just aren't there.\n\nWait, but shadows are more pronounced during the day when the sun is out, casting shadows. At night, with less light, shadows are less visible. So maybe that's not the right answer.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's something related to light itself. Like, at night, light comes into your home without being fetched, perhaps from streetlights or the moon, and during the day, natural light is abundant, so you don't need to fetch it, but at night, you do.\n\nBut that doesn't quite fit the riddle's phrasing. Let's try something else.\n\nCould it be something like sleep? At night, sleep comes naturally without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen, meaning you don't have to steal it; it just goes away as you wake up.\n\nThat seems plausible, but maybe there's a more fitting answer.\n\nAnother possibility is darkness itself. At night, darkness comes without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen, as the sun dispels it.\n\nBut I feel like the answer is something more tangible or perhaps a process.\n\nLet me consider the phrase \"come without being fetched.\" That implies something that arrives on its own, without human intervention.\n\nAnd \"lost without being stolen\" suggests it disappears naturally, not through any action by someone.\n\nHmm, maybe it's a type of fluid or substance. For example, dew. Dew forms at night without being fetched, and by day, it evaporates without being stolen.\n\nThat could work. Dew appears on surfaces at night due to cooler temperatures and humidity in the air, and during the day, it evaporates as temperatures rise.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the intended answer.\n\nAnother option is dreams. Dreams come to us at night without being fetched, and by day, they are lost without being stolen, as we wake up and often forget our dreams.\n\nThat's another possible answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's nightfall or twilight. At night, it comes without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen.\n\nBut that seems a bit too straightforward.\n\nLet me think if there are any other possibilities.\n\nCould it be something related to technology, like electricity? At night, electricity is used to light up our homes without being fetched, and by day, we don't need to fetch it as there's natural light.\n\nBut that doesn't quite fit the \"lost without being stolen\" part.\n\nMaybe it's inspiration or ideas. At night, when we're sleeping or relaxing, ideas can come to us without being fetched, and by day, they might be lost if we don't write them down, without being stolen by someone else.\n\nThat's an interesting angle, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: could it be stars? At night, stars are visible without being fetched, and by day, they are lost in the brightness of the sun, without being stolen.\n\nThat could be a possible answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's moonlight. At night, moonlight comes without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen, as the sun outshines it.\n\nThat seems similar to the stars idea.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more abstract concept.\n\nCould it be silence? At night, silence comes without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen, as daytime is noisier.\n\nThat could work too.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's calmness or peace. At night, there's often more peace and quiet, which comes without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen, as daytime can be busier and noisier.\n\nThat seems similar to silence.\n\nAnother possibility is darkness again, but perhaps thinking of it in terms of mood or atmosphere.\n\nWait, maybe it's something that is present at night and absent during the day, but not necessarily in the physical sense.\n\nCould it be dreams again, or maybe nightmares?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the cool temperature at night, which comes without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen, as temperatures rise.\n\nThat could be another answer.\n\nI'm starting to think that there might be multiple answers to this riddle, depending on how you interpret the phrases.\n\nLet me see if I can find a more definitive answer.\n\nLooking back at the riddle: \"At night I come without being fetched. By day I am lost without being stolen.\"\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think of something that is inherent to night and disappears with the day, without any human intervention.\n\nConsidering that, dew is a good candidate, as it forms naturally at night and evaporates during the day.\n\nSimilarly, darkness, shadows, stars, moonlight, and cool temperatures all fit this description.\n\nPerhaps the answer is open to interpretation, and any of these could be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more specific answer that I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to think outside the box.\n\nCould it be something like fear or anxiety that comes at night and is lost during the day?\n\nOr perhaps something more positive, like hope or optimism that appears at night and disappears during the day.\n\nBut that seems less likely, as the riddle seems to be referring to something more concrete.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps it's something that people experience or utilize at night that is not present during the day.\n\nFor example, nocturnal animals are active at night and rest during the day, but that might not fit the wording of the riddle.\n\nAlternatively, could it be something like night vision? At night, our night vision improves without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen, as we don't need it.\n\nThat's an interesting thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the ability to see stars or constellations, which are visible at night and not during the day.\n\nBut again, that seems similar to earlier answers.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward answer is darkness itself.\n\nAt night, darkness comes without being fetched, and by day, it's lost without being stolen.\n\nThis seems to directly fit the description.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the riddle from the perspective of a particular object or phenomenon, darkness is a strong candidate.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to confirm this.\n\nSometimes riddles have puns or plays on words, but in this case, it seems more straightforward.\n\nGiven that, I think darkness is the most appropriate answer to the riddle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{darkness}} \\]"
