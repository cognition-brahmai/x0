So, a number that's divisible by both 3 and 5 should be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM). What's the LCM of 3 and 5?\n\nWell, 3 and 5 are both prime numbers, so their LCM is just their product: 3 times 5 is 15. So, I'm looking for numbers between 1 and 1000 that are divisible by 15.\n\nNext, I need to find all multiples of 15 within that range and then sum them up. How do I find all multiples of 15 from 1 to 1000?\n\nI can start by finding the smallest multiple of 15 that is greater than or equal to 1, which is 15 itself, and the largest multiple of 15 that is less than or equal to 1000.\n\nTo find the largest multiple of 15 under 1000, I can divide 1000 by 15 and see what I get.\n\n1000 divided by 15 is approximately 66.666..., so the largest integer multiple is 66 times 15, which is 990. So, the multiples of 15 between 1 and 1000 are 15, 30, 45, ..., up to 990.\n\nNow, I need to sum these up. This looks like an arithmetic series where the first term a_1 is 15, the common difference d is 15, and the last term a_n is 990.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\nS = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nSo, I need to find n, the number of terms.\n\nI can find n using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n990 = 15 + (n - 1)*15\n\nLet's solve for n:\n\n990 = 15 + 15(n - 1)\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n975 = 15(n - 1)\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\n65 = n - 1\n\nSo, n = 66\n\nNow, plug these values back into the sum formula:\n\nS = 66/2 * (15 + 990) = 33 * 1005\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n33 times 1000 is 33,000\n\n33 times 5 is 165\n\nSo, 33,000 plus 165 is 33,165\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integers from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by both 3 and 5 is 33,165.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to confirm this.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for the sum of multiples of a number. The sum of multiples of m up to n is m * floor(n/m) * (floor(n/m) + 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, m is 15, and n is 1000.\n\nSo, sum = 15 * floor(1000/15) * (floor(1000/15) + 1) / 2\n\nWe already calculated floor(1000/15) as 66\n\nSo, sum = 15 * 66 * 67 / 2\n\nFirst, 66 * 67. Let's compute that:\n\n60 times 67 is 4,020\n\n6 times 67 is 402\n\nSo, 4,020 + 402 is 4,422\n\nNow, 4,422 divided by 2 is 2,211\n\nThen, 15 times 2,211\n\n10 times 2,211 is 22,110\n\n5 times 2,211 is 11,055\n\nSo, 22,110 + 11,055 is 33,165\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but since the problem specifies numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, which is the same as divisible by 15, I think the approach I took is sufficient.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this. Sometimes, problems like these can be tricky, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if 1000 is inclusive. The problem says \"from 1 to 1000,\" so including 1000. However, since 1000 is not divisible by 15, it doesn't affect the sum.\n\nAlso, I made sure that 990 is included, which is divisible by 15, and that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is indeed 33,165.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33165} \\]"
