        "content": "Sure! Here's a JavaScript function that implements the binary search algorithm on a sorted array of numbers:\n\n```javascript\nfunction binarySearch(arr, target) {\n    let left = 0;\n    let right = arr.length - 1;\n    \n    while (left <= right) {\n        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);\n        \n        if (arr[mid] === target) {\n            return mid; // Target found, return its index\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\n            left = mid + 1; // Target is in the right half\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1; // Target is in the left half\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return -1; // Target not found\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `left` is set to the starting index of the array (0).\n   - `right` is set to the ending index of the array (`arr.length - 1`).\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.\n   - In each iteration, the midpoint (`mid`) is calculated using `Math.floor((left + right) / 2)`.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - If the element at the midpoint (`arr[mid]`) is equal to the target, the function returns the index `mid`.\n   - If the element at the midpoint is less than the target, the search continues in the right half by setting `left` to `mid + 1`.\n   - If the element at the midpoint is greater than the target, the search continues in the left half by setting `right` to `mid - 1`.\n\n4. **Target Not Found**:\n   - If the loop exits without finding the target, the function returns -1 indicating that the target is not present in the array.\n\nThis function efficiently searches for a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, which makes it much faster than a linear search for large arrays."
