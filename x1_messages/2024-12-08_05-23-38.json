        "content": "The classic American novel that features characters such as Scout Finch, Atticus Finch, and Boo Radley is \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee. This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was first published in 1960 and is set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression. The story is narrated by Scout Finch, a young girl who learns valuable lessons about compassion, courage, and injustice through her father Atticus Finch, a principled lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of rape, and their reclusive neighbor Boo Radley. The novel explores themes of racial inequality, moral growth, and the loss of innocence, making it a timeless masterpiece in American literature."
