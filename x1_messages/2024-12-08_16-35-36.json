        "content": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about two trains leaving different stations and traveling towards each other. Station A and Station B are 200 miles apart, with Station B being east of Station A. One train leaves Station A going east at 50 mph, and the other leaves Station B going west at 70 mph. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the situation. So, Station A is somewhere, and Station B is 200 miles east of Station A. Train 1 leaves A going east, and Train 2 leaves B going west. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up relative to each other.\n\nLet me confirm that. If one train is going east at 50 mph and the other is going west at 70 mph, their closing speed, or the rate at which the distance between them is decreasing, should be the sum of their speeds. So, 50 + 70 = 120 mph.\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is 200 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 200 miles / 120 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 200 divided by 120 is... hmm, 120 goes into 200 one time, with 80 miles left over. Then, 120 goes into 80 miles... well, 120 goes into 80 two-thirds of a time, since 80 divided by 120 is 2/3.\n\nSo, the time is 1 and 2/3 hours.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express that in minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, and 2/3 of an hour is 40 minutes, the total time is 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should convert the entire time into minutes to make sure.\n\nFirst, 120 mph is the same as 120 miles per 60 minutes, which is 2 miles per minute.\n\nSo, if the distance is 200 miles, and they're closing in at 2 miles per minute, then the time would be 200 miles divided by 2 miles per minute, which is 100 minutes.\n\nNow, 100 minutes is 1 hour and 40 minutes, since 60 minutes make an hour, and 40 minutes left over.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 1 hour and 40 minutes directly from dividing 200 by 120. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can express 2/3 of an hour as a decimal. 2/3 is approximately 0.6667, so 1 + 0.6667 = 1.6667 hours.\n\nIf I multiply 0.6667 by 60, I get approximately 40 minutes, confirming the 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should rationalize it further to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLet me think about the directions again. Train 1 is leaving A going east, and Train 2 is leaving B going west. Since B is east of A, and both are moving towards each other, yes, their speeds add up.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to find the time.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time in hours as t.\n\nIn that time, Train 1 would have traveled 50t miles east from A.\n\nTrain 2 would have traveled 70t miles west from B.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the distance between them decreases at a rate of 50 + 70 = 120 mph, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, the total distance covered by both trains when they meet should be equal to the initial distance between them, which is 200 miles.\n\nTherefore, 50t + 70t = 200\n\nCombining like terms, 120t = 200\n\nNow, solve for t: t = 200 / 120 = 1.6667 hours, or 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I can express it as 5/3 hours, since 200 divided by 120 is 5/3.\n\nAnd 5/3 hours is indeed 1 and 2/3 hours, which is 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nSo, it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought that Train 1 is going east from A, and Train 2 is going west from B, which is already considering their directions towards each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider their positions as functions of time.\n\nLet\u2019s set up a coordinate system where Station A is at position 0, and Station B is at position 200 miles.\n\nTrain 1 starts at 0 and moves east (positive direction) at 50 mph.\n\nTrain 2 starts at 200 miles and moves west (negative direction) at 70 mph.\n\nWait, no. If B is east of A, and Train 2 is moving west from B, then in terms of coordinates, if A is at 0 and B at 200, Train 1 is moving towards increasing x, and Train 2 is moving towards decreasing x.\n\nSo, Train 1's position as a function of time is:\n\nx1 = 0 + 50t\n\nTrain 2's position as a function of time is:\n\nx2 = 200 - 70t\n\nThey meet when x1 = x2.\n\nSo:\n\n0 + 50t = 200 - 70t\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n50t + 70t = 200\n\n120t = 200\n\nt = 200 / 120\n\nt = 5/3 hours, or approximately 1.6667 hours, which is 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the relative velocity of Train 1 with respect to Train 2, since they're moving towards each other, it's the sum of their speeds, 120 mph, and the distance is 200 miles, so time is 200 / 120 = 5/3 hours.\n\nEverything points to 5/3 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, perhaps I can think about it in terms of each train's contribution to closing the gap.\n\nTrain 1 is closing the gap at 50 mph, and Train 2 is closing it at 70 mph, so together, 120 mph.\n\nDistance is 200 miles, so time is 200 / 120 = 5/3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the proportion of distances each train travels.\n\nIn time t, Train 1 travels 50t miles, and Train 2 travels 70t miles.\n\nThe sum should be 200 miles, so again, 50t + 70t = 200, leading to t = 5/3 hours.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1 hour and 40 minutes, or 5/3 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nWait a second, the problem says Train 1 is leaving Station A traveling east at 50 mph, and Train 2 is leaving Station B, which is 200 miles east of A, traveling west at 70 mph.\n\nSo, they are indeed moving towards each other, and my approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the trains were traveling in the same direction, say both east or both west, then the relative speed would be different, but in this case, they're moving towards each other.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider their speeds in miles per minute.\n\n50 mph is 50/60 miles per minute, which is approximately 0.8333 mph.\n\n70 mph is 70/60 miles per minute, approximately 1.1667 mph.\n\nBut that might not be necessary, as working with hours is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of relative speed is the most straightforward method.\n\nRelative speed when moving towards each other is the sum of their speeds, so 120 mph.\n\nTime = distance / relative speed = 200 / 120 = 5/3 hours.\n\nYes, that seems to be the most direct approach.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that 5/3 hours, or 1 hour and 40 minutes, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{3} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
