        "content": "So Tom and Jerry are playing this coin-flipping game where the first one to flip heads wins, and Tom goes first. I need to figure out the probability that Tom wins. Hmm, let's see.\n\nSince it's a fair coin, the probability of flipping heads or tails is equal, right? So, each has a 50% chance. Tom goes first, so he has his first chance to win right away by flipping heads.\n\nBut if he flips tails, then it's Jerry's turn. If Jerry flips heads, he wins. But if Jerry also flips tails, then it's back to Tom for another try, and this continues until someone flips heads.\n\nSo, the probability that Tom wins on his first try is just the probability of flipping heads, which is 1/2.\n\nBut if he flips tails (which is also 1/2 chance), then Jerry gets a turn. Jerry has to flip tails as well for Tom to get another chance. So, the probability that both Tom and Jerry flip tails is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nIf that happens, then it's back to Tom, and the game essentially resets, with Tom again having a first-chance probability to win.\n\nWait, this seems like an infinite series kind of problem. Tom can win on his first try, or his second try, or his third try, and so on, infinitely, but only if both he and Jerry keep flipping tails in their previous turns.\n\nSo, the total probability that Tom wins is the sum of the probabilities of him winning on his first try, plus his second try, plus his third try, and so on.\n\nLet's denote the probability that Tom wins as P.\n\nThen, P = probability Tom wins on first try + probability Tom wins on second try + probability Tom wins on third try + ...\n\nThe probability that Tom wins on his first try is 1/2.\n\nThe probability that Tom wins on his second try is the probability that both Tom and Jerry flip tails on their first tries, and then Tom flips heads on his second try. That would be (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that Tom wins on his third try is the probability that both Tom and Jerry flip tails twice in a row, and then Tom flips heads on his third try. That would be (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2) = (1/8) * (1/4) = 1/32. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, no. Let's think differently. The probability that the game returns to Tom after both flip tails is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. Then, the situation is reset, and Tom again has a probability P of winning from that point on.\n\nSo, P = probability Tom wins on first try + probability game returns to Tom * P.\n\nIn other words, P = (1/2) + (1/4) * P.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if Tom flips heads on his first try, he wins immediately. If not, and the game returns to him (which happens with probability 1/4), then he's in the same position as before, with probability P of winning from there.\n\nSo, P = 1/2 + (1/4)P.\n\nNow, I can solve for P.\n\nSubtract (1/4)P from both sides: P - (1/4)P = 1/2.\n\nThat's (3/4)P = 1/2.\n\nThen, P = (1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3.\n\nSo, the probability that Tom wins is 2/3.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the probability of Tom winning is the sum of an infinite geometric series where the first term is 1/2 (winning on first try), and the common ratio is 1/4 (the probability that both flip tails, leading back to Tom).\n\nSo, P = (1/2) + (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)^3*(1/2)^2*(1/2) + ...\n\nWait, that seems messy. Let's simplify.\n\nActually, P = (1/2) + (1/4)^1 * (1/2) + (1/4)^2 * (1/2) + ...\n\nThat is, P = (1/2) * (1 + 1/4 + (1/4)^2 + ...)\n\nThe sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series with ratio 1/4, so the sum is 1 / (1 - 1/4) = 1 / (3/4) = 4/3.\n\nTherefore, P = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of expected outcomes. Since Tom goes first, he has a higher chance of winning because he has more opportunities to flip heads before Jerry does.\n\nIn fact, in these kinds of games where players take turns, the first player generally has an advantage.\n\nSo, intuitively, Tom should have a probability greater than 1/2 of winning, which aligns with the 2/3 calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability that Jerry wins, and then Tom's probability is 1 minus that.\n\nIf Tom goes first, Jerry only gets a chance if Tom flips tails, which is 1/2 chance. Then, Jerry has a 1/2 chance of flipping heads and winning, or 1/2 chance of flipping tails and the game continues.\n\nSo, probability that Jerry wins on his first try is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that Jerry wins on his second try is the probability that both Tom and Jerry flip tails on their first tries, and then Jerry flips heads on his second try: (1/2)^3 * (1/2) = 1/16.\n\nWait, actually, it's (1/2)^3 * (1/2) = 1/16, but I think I'm making it complicated again.\n\nAlternatively, probability that Jerry wins is the probability that Tom flips tails (1/2) times the probability that Jerry flips heads (1/2), which is 1/4, plus the probability that both flip tails (1/4) times the probability that Jerry wins from there, which is the same as his original probability.\n\nSo, let's denote P_J as the probability that Jerry wins.\n\nThen, P_J = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)*(1/2)*P_J = 1/4 + (1/4)P_J.\n\nSo, P_J = 1/4 + (1/4)P_J.\n\nSubtract (1/4)P_J from both sides: P_J - (1/4)P_J = 1/4.\n\nThat's (3/4)P_J = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, P_J = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.\n\nSince Tom's probability of winning is 1 - P_J = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead to the same conclusion that Tom has a 2/3 probability of winning the game.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
