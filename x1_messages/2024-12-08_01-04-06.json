He is best known for his contributions to the field of physics, particularly for developing the theory of relativity and his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which led to the development of quantum theory. His famous equation E=mc\u00b2 demonstrates the equivalence of energy and mass. Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical physics, especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."
