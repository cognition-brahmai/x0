It's essential to have a backup plan or consider alternative possibilities to avoid disappointment or failure. Moreover, focusing solely on one outcome can lead to stress and anxiety, which may negatively impact your overall well-being. It's always better to approach goals and aspirations with a balanced mindset and be prepared for different scenarios.\n"
