You mentioned Martin Luther King Jr. as a figure in the Women's Suffrage Movement, assassinated on August 12, 1970, in Atlanta, Georgia. But I think there might be some confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nFirst off, Martin Luther King Jr. was actually a central figure in the African American Civil Rights Movement, not the Women's Suffrage Movement. He was a Baptist minister and a prominent leader who advocated for equality and nonviolent protest. His most famous speech is \"I Have a Dream,\" which he delivered during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963.\n\nRegarding his assassination, it occurred on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, not August 12, 1970, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was there to support striking sanitation workers who were demanding better working conditions and equal treatment.\n\nAfter his assassination, there were indeed widespread riots and protests across the United States, not just nationwide protests for justice and gender equality. These events highlighted the deep divisions and the ongoing struggle for civil rights in the country.\n\nIt's possible that there's some mix-up with another historical figure or event. For instance, the Women's Suffrage Movement was primarily about securing voting rights for women, and it had its own set of leaders like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The movement culminated with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which prohibited states from denying the right to vote based on sex.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n\n**Source:**\n\n- History.com - Martin Luther King Jr. Assassination [https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr-assassination]"
