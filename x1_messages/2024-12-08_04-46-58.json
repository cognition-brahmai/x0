        "content": "Let's see. We have two cars starting from opposite ends of a straight road, each moving towards each other. Car A is starting from point X at 40 miles per hour, and Car B is starting from point Y at 60 miles per hour. The total distance between X and Y is 500 miles. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both cars are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up relative to each other. So, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nCombined speed = Speed of Car A + Speed of Car B\nCombined speed = 40 mph + 60 mph = 100 mph\n\nNow, they are covering a distance of 500 miles towards each other at this combined speed. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 500 miles / 100 mph = 5 hours\n\nSo, it should take 5 hours for the two cars to meet.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the time it takes for each car to cover their respective distances, and since they meet at the same time, set their times equal.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time it takes for them to meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, Car A would have traveled a distance of 40t miles (since distance = speed \u00d7 time).\n\nSimilarly, Car B would have traveled 60t miles in the same time t.\n\nSince they are moving towards each other from ends that are 500 miles apart, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the total distance between them.\n\nSo:\n\nDistance traveled by Car A + Distance traveled by Car B = Total distance\n\n40t + 60t = 500\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n100t = 500\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 500 / 100 = 5 hours\n\nOkay, this confirms the earlier result. So, it will take 5 hours for the two cars to meet.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way to look at this. Perhaps using relative velocity concepts.\n\nIn physics, when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative velocity is the sum of their individual velocities. So, in this case, the relative velocity is 40 mph + 60 mph = 100 mph.\n\nThe time it takes for them to meet is the total distance divided by their relative velocity.\n\nAgain, Time = Distance / Relative Velocity = 500 miles / 100 mph = 5 hours\n\nThis matches the previous calculations.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the two cars will meet after 5 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this, like acceleration or changes in speed, but the problem states that both cars are traveling at constant speeds. So, no need to consider those factors.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent: both speeds are in miles per hour, and the distance is in miles, so the time will indeed be in hours.\n\nOne more thing: making sure that the direction each car is traveling is correctly accounted for. Since they are moving towards each other on a straight road, their paths will intersect at some point between X and Y.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
