        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with 12,000 people, and we're told that 20% of the population owns cats. First things first, I need to find out how many people own cats.\n\nTo do that, I'll take 20% of 12,000. Percentage means per hundred, so 20% is the same as 20 per 100, or 20/100, which is 0.20 in decimal form. So, the number of cat owners is 0.20 times 12,000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.20 \u00d7 12,000 = 2,400. So, there are 2,400 cat owners in the town.\n\nNext, the problem says that 15% of the cat owners also own dogs. I need to find out how many people that is. Again, percentage wise, 15% is 15 per 100, or 15/100, which is 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nSo, the number of people who own both cats and dogs is 0.15 times the number of cat owners, which is 0.15 \u00d7 2,400.\n\nLet me do that math: 0.15 \u00d7 2,400 = 360.\n\nTherefore, 360 people in the town own both cats and dogs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. The total population is 12,000. 20% own cats, which is 2,400 people. Then, 15% of these cat owners also own dogs, which is 360 people. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should approach the problem differently to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the percentages directly. Overall, 20% own cats, and of those, 15% also own dogs. So, the percentage of the total population that owns both cats and dogs is 20% times 15%.\n\nWait, is that correct? Actually, no. Because 15% is of the cat owners, not of the total population. So, it's not a multiplication of the two percentages directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of conditional probability. The probability that someone owns a dog given that they own a cat is 15%. So, P(dog|cat) = 15%.\n\nAnd the total probability of owning both a cat and a dog would be P(cat) times P(dog|cat).\n\nGiven that P(cat) is 20%, and P(dog|cat) is 15%, then P(cat and dog) is 20% times 15%, which is 3%.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated it to be 360 people, which is indeed 3% of 12,000, because 3% of 12,000 is 0.03 \u00d7 12,000 = 360. So, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it: out of every 100 cat owners, 15 also own dogs. Since there are 2,400 cat owners, then the number of people who own both is (15/100) \u00d7 2,400 = 360.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total population, 20% own cats, and of those, 15% own dogs, so the fraction that owns both is 0.20 \u00d7 0.15 = 0.03, which is 3% of the total population, leading again to 360 people.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer remains the same. So, I'm confident that 360 is the correct number of people who own both cats and dogs.\n\nJust to be extra sure, perhaps I should consider if there's any overlapping ownership or other factors that might affect this number. The problem doesn't mention any other pets or any constraints beyond cat and dog ownership, so I think it's safe to assume that the only relevant information is the percentages given.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that 15% of cat owners also own dogs, which means that these are people who have both cats and dogs. It doesn't specify anything about people who own dogs but not cats, so that information isn't necessary for this particular question.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, the number of people who own both cats and dogs is 360.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
