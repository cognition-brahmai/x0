Each plan will have an associated evidence value, which is the output from one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. This tool is useful in finding relevant websites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from a website link provided as input and produces a plain text output containing the content of the site.\nLinkLister[input]: Extracts links from plain text and provides a list of links as output.\nNLPModel[input]: Natural Language Processing model capable of answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing a #E[n] variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given #E1?\n\nThe input to each function should be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., NLPModel[What is the capital of Michigan, given #E3?]\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E1 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what was their most acclaimed work?"
