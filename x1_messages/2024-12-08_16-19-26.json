        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input list into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:\n\n1. **Divide**: If the input list has more than one element, divide it into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python. I'll write a function called `merge_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing the same integers sorted in ascending order.\n\nFirst, I need to write a helper function called `merge` that takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list. Here's how it works:\n\n- Initialize an empty list to store the merged result.\n- Use two indices to track the current positions in the two input lists.\n- Compare the elements at the current positions and append the smaller one to the result list.\n- Move the index of the list from which the element was taken.\n- Repeat this process until all elements from both lists are merged.\n\nNow, let's write the `merge_sort` function:\n\n- If the input list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so return it as is.\n- Otherwise, divide the list into two halves.\n- Recursively sort the two halves using `merge_sort`.\n- Merge the two sorted halves using the `merge` function.\n\nI'll also include some comments in the code to make it easier to understand.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\ndef merge(left, right):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the merged result\n    merged = []\n    left_index = 0\n    right_index = 0\n    \n    # Merge the two lists by comparing elements\n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:\n            merged.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n    \n    # Append any remaining elements from the left list\n    while left_index < len(left):\n        merged.append(left[left_index])\n        left_index += 1\n    \n    # Append any remaining elements from the right list\n    while right_index < len(right):\n        merged.append(right[right_index])\n        right_index += 1\n    \n    return merged\n\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    \n    # Divide the list into two halves\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = arr[:mid]\n    right_half = arr[mid:]\n    \n    # Recursively sort the two halves\n    left_sorted = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right_sorted = merge_sort(right_half)\n    \n    # Merge the sorted halves\n    return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sample_list = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]\n    sorted_list = merge_sort(sample_list)\n    print(\"Original list:\", sample_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `merge` function takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list.\n- The `merge_sort` function recursively divides the input list into halves, sorts them, and then merges them using the `merge` function.\n- The example usage demonstrates sorting a sample list and printing both the original and sorted lists.\n\nThis implementation should work for any list of integers.
