        "content": "In the spirit of Langston Hughes, I'll craft a triolet about friendship. Hughes was known for his poignant portrayal of African-American life and his use of jazz and blues rhythms in his poetry. So, I'll aim to capture some of that essence in this form.\n\nA triolet is a fixed verse form consisting of eight lines, with specific lines repeated. The rhyme scheme is ABaAabAB, where capital letters indicate the repeated lines.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\nIn the quiet shade of the jasmine tree,\n\nFriends gather, their laughter a sweet melody.\n\nUnderneath the sky so vast and free,\n\nIn the quiet shade of the jasmine tree.\n\nTheir stories weave like threads of destiny,\n\nEach smile a promise, each tear a history.\n\nIn the quiet shade of the jasmine tree,\n\nFriends gather, their laughter a sweet melody.\n\nI tried to capture the warmth and camaraderie of friends coming together, using imagery that evokes a sense of place and time, much like Hughes often did in his works. The repetition in the triolet form emphasizes the enduring nature of friendship, much like how certain themes recur in Hughes' poetry."
