It orbits Earth at an altitude of about 340 miles, above the distortion of Earth's atmosphere, which allows it to capture high-resolution images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and stars. The data collected by Hubble has led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe.

        "content": "The primary advantage of placing a telescope like the Hubble Space Telescope in space is that it can avoid the distortion of Earth's atmosphere. So, the correct answer is C.\n\nLet me explain why this is the case. When we observe the universe from the ground, our view is affected by the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is made up of different layers of gases, and these gases can bend or scatter the light coming from celestial objects. This phenomenon is similar to what happens when you look at a straw in a glass of water; it appears bent because of the way light travels through different mediums.\n\nIn the case of telescopes on Earth, the atmosphere acts like a constantly moving lens, which can blur the images of stars and galaxies. This blurring effect is known as atmospheric distortion or astronomical seeing. It's why stars appear to twinkle in the night sky.\n\nBy placing a telescope in space, above the Earth's atmosphere, Hubble avoids this distortion entirely. This allows it to capture much clearer and sharper images of the universe. The images are of higher resolution, meaning they show more detail, which has been crucial for many astronomical discoveries.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options to understand why they're not the primary advantage:\n\nA. It can travel to distant galaxies - Actually, telescopes in space, including Hubble, don't travel to distant galaxies. They remain in orbit around Earth and observe distant objects by collecting the light that reaches them. The distance to galaxies is so vast that even traveling at the speed of light, it would take millions or billions of years to reach them. So, space telescopes observe from a fixed point, just from a position outside the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nB. It can avoid light pollution from cities - While it's true that space telescopes are beyond Earth's light pollution, this isn't their primary advantage. Light pollution is mainly an issue for ground-based telescopes located near cities, where artificial light can interfere with observations. However, many ground-based telescopes are situated in remote locations with minimal light pollution. Moreover, advancements in technology have allowed for better mitigation of light pollution effects. Therefore, while avoiding light pollution is beneficial, it's not the main reason space telescopes provide better observations.\n\nD. It can capture images in non-visible wavelengths - Some space telescopes are designed to observe wavelengths that are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, such as X-rays or certain infrared wavelengths. Hubble, for example, can observe in ultraviolet, visible, and some infrared wavelengths. However, the ability to observe in non-visible wavelengths is not unique to space telescopes. There are ground-based telescopes equipped to observe in specific wavelengths, and some wavelengths can be observed from the ground with specialized instruments. So, while it's an advantage, it's not the primary one.\n\nE. None of the above - Since option C is correct, this isn't the case.\n\nIn summary, the primary advantage of placing a telescope like Hubble in space is to avoid the distortion caused by Earth's atmosphere, which leads to significantly sharper and more detailed images of the universe."
