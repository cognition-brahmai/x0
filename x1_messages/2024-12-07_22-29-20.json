        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. We'll make sure it handles both positive and negative inputs and provides appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120. By definition, 0! is 1.\n\nNow, since factorials are only defined for non-negative integers, we need to handle cases where the input is negative or not an integer. For this program, we'll assume that the input is an integer, but we'll check if it's negative and provide an error message in that case.\n\nWe'll use recursion to calculate the factorial. Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In the case of factorial, n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)! and we know that 0! = 1.\n\nHere's how we can structure our program:\n\n1. Create a class, say `FactorialCalculator`.\n2. Inside this class, define a recursive method, say `factorial`, that takes an integer n and returns the factorial of n.\n3. In the `main` method, read input from the user, call the `factorial` method, and handle any invalid inputs.\n\nLet's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, define the `FactorialCalculator` class:\n\n```java\npublic class FactorialCalculator {\n    // Recursive method to calculate factorial\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Code to read input and handle calculations will go here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `factorial` method, we have a base case where if n is 0, we return 1. Otherwise, we return n multiplied by the factorial of n-1.\n\nNow, in the `main` method, we need to read an integer input from the user. We'll use the `Scanner` class for this purpose. We also need to handle the case where the input is negative.\n\nHere's how we can do it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FactorialCalculator {\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n        int n = scanner.nextInt();\n        \n        if (n < 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\");\n        } else {\n            long result = factorial(n);\n            System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + n + \" is \" + result);\n        }\n        \n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first import the `Scanner` class. Then, in the `main` method, we create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console. We prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer and read it into the variable `n`.\n\nWe then check if `n` is negative. If it is, we print an error message. Otherwise, we call the `factorial` method with `n` and print the result.\n\nThis should work for non-negative integers. However, if the input is not an integer, our program will throw an exception because `scanner.nextInt()` expects an integer input. To handle this, we can improve our input handling to ensure that the input is indeed an integer.\n\nLet's modify the `main` method to handle non-integer inputs:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.InputMismatchException;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FactorialCalculator {\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n        \n        try {\n            int n = scanner.nextInt();\n            \n            if (n < 0) {\n                System.out.println(\"Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\");\n            } else {\n                long result = factorial(n);\n                System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + n + \" is \" + result);\n            }\n        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\");\n        } finally {\n            scanner.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, we use a try-catch block to catch `InputMismatchException` if the user enters something that's not an integer. If an exception is caught, we print an error message indicating that the input is invalid.\n\nThis should cover most of the cases for invalid inputs. However, there's one more thing to consider: integer overflow. Factorials grow very quickly, and for large values of n, the factorial might exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a `long` variable in Java (which is 2^63 - 1).\n\nFor example, 20! is 2,432,902,008,176,640,000, which is within the range of `long`, but 21! is 51,090,942,171,709,440,000, which exceeds the maximum value of `long` and causes an overflow.\n\nTo handle this, we could add a check to see if n is greater than 20 and inform the user that the factorial is too large to compute accurately with a `long` variable.\n\nHere's how we can modify the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.InputMismatchException;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FactorialCalculator {\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n        \n        try {\n            int n = scanner.nextInt();\n            \n            if (n < 0) {\n                System.out.println(\"Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\");\n            } else if (n > 20) {\n                System.out.println(\"Error: Factorial is too large to compute accurately with integers.\");\n            } else {\n                long result = factorial(n);\n                System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + n + \" is \" + result);\n            }\n        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\");\n        } finally {\n            scanner.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, if the user enters a number greater than 20, we inform them that the factorial is too large to compute accurately with integers.\n\nThis should cover all the requirements: handling positive and negative inputs, providing error messages for invalid inputs, and warning about integer overflow for large inputs.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further modifications, feel free to ask!"
