        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a city's water treatment plant that needs to upgrade its infrastructure because of population growth. The current plant can process 1 million gallons of water per day, and the city expects to need a 25% increase in capacity within the next five years. I need to calculate the additional processing capacity required and estimate the cost of upgrading the plant, given that it costs $500,000 per 100,000-gallon increase in capacity. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what 25% of the current capacity is, because that's the additional amount they need. The current capacity is 1 million gallons per day. So, 25% of 1 million is calculated as:\n\n25% of 1,000,000 = 0.25 * 1,000,000 = 250,000 gallons per day.\n\nSo, the additional processing capacity required is 250,000 gallons per day.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the cost of this upgrade. I'm told that it costs $500,000 per 100,000-gallon increase in capacity. So, for every additional 100,000 gallons per day, it costs $500,000.\n\nNow, the additional capacity needed is 250,000 gallons per day. To find out how many 100,000-gallon increments are in 250,000 gallons, I divide 250,000 by 100,000:\n\n250,000 / 100,000 = 2.5\n\nSo, they need 2.5 increments of 100,000 gallons per day.\n\nNow, each of these increments costs $500,000, so the total cost would be:\n\n2.5 * $500,000 = $1,250,000\n\nTherefore, the estimated cost of upgrading the plant to handle the increased demand is $1,250,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at this. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the cost per gallon and then multiply by the total additional capacity needed. But, the problem gives the cost per 100,000 gallons, so it's easier to stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to find the cost per gallon, it would be $500,000 per 100,000 gallons, which is $5 per gallon. Then, for 250,000 gallons, it would be 250,000 * $5 = $1,250,000. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up a proportion. If $500,000 corresponds to 100,000 gallons, then x dollars corresponds to 250,000 gallons. So, x = (500,000 * 250,000) / 100,000 = (500,000 * 2.5) = $1,250,000. Again, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I end up with $1,250,000 as the estimated cost for the upgrade.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. However, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the cost. For example, are there any permitting costs, or costs associated with purchasing land for expansion, or costs for hiring additional staff? But based on the information provided, it seems like the cost is solely based on the increase in capacity in terms of gallons processed per day, and the rate is $500,000 per 100,000-gallon increase.\n\nSo, assuming that's the only cost involved, then $1,250,000 is the total estimated cost.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the cost scales linearly. In other words, does adding 100,000 gallons cost $500,000, and adding another 100,000 gallons also cost $500,000, and so on? Or is there a economies of scale, where adding more capacity might reduce the cost per gallon? But again, based on the information provided, it seems like the cost is constant at $500,000 per 100,000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with the initial calculation.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Additional capacity needed: 25% of 1,000,000 gallons = 250,000 gallons per day.\n\n- Cost per 100,000 gallons: $500,000.\n\n- Number of 100,000-gallon increments needed: 2.5.\n\n- Total cost: 2.5 * $500,000 = $1,250,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe additional processing capacity required is \\boxed{250,000} gallons per day, and the estimated cost of upgrading the plant is \\boxed{1,250,000} dollars."
