        "content": "So there are 30 students in the classroom, and 60% of them wear glasses. I need to find out how many students do not wear glasses.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students wear glasses. Since 60% of them wear glasses, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 30.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 30, I can multiply 30 by 0.60.\n\n30 \u00d7 0.60 = 18\n\nSo, 18 students wear glasses.\n\nNow, to find out how many students do not wear glasses, I can subtract the number of students who wear glasses from the total number of students.\n\n30 - 18 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 students do not wear glasses.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of students who do not wear glasses.\n\nIf 60% wear glasses, then 100% - 60% = 40% do not wear glasses.\n\nSo, 40% of 30 students do not wear glasses.\n\nLet me calculate 40% of 30.\n\n30 \u00d7 0.40 = 12\n\nAgain, I get 12 students do not wear glasses.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 12 is the correct number of students who do not wear glasses.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Percentages can sometimes be tricky, but in this case, it's pretty simple.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst method:\n\n60% of 30:\n\n30 \u00d7 0.60 = 18\n\n30 - 18 = 12\n\nSecond method:\n\n40% of 30:\n\n30 \u00d7 0.40 = 12\n\nBoth methods agree, so I'm confident the answer is 12 students do not wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
