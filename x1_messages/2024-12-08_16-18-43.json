I'm not an expert in Go, but I've done some web scraping before, so I'll do my best to guide you through it.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what we're trying to achieve. We want to write a program that takes a URL, fetches the HTML content from that URL, and then counts how often each word appears on that page. Finally, we want to sort these words by their frequency in descending order.\n\nOkay, so let's break this down into steps:\n\n1. **Fetch the HTML content from the URL.**\n\n2. **Extract the text from the HTML.**\n\n3. **Split the text into words.**\n\n4. **Count the frequency of each word.**\n\n5. **Sort the words by frequency in descending order.**\n\n6. **Print the results.**\n\nSounds straightforward. Now, let's think about how to implement each step in Go.\n\n**Step 1: Fetch the HTML content from the URL.**\n\nIn Go, we can use the `net/http` package to make HTTP requests. So, we'll need to do something like:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"io/ioutil\"\n)\n\nfunc fetchHTML(url string) ([]byte, error) {\n    response, err := http.Get(url)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    defer response.Body.Close()\n    return ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)\n}\n```\n\nThis function will take a URL as input, make an HTTP GET request to that URL, read the response body, and return the HTML content as a byte slice.\n\n**Step 2: Extract the text from the HTML.**\n\nNow, we need to extract only the text from the HTML content, ignoring tags and other markup. For this, we can use the `goquery` package, which provides a jQuery-like syntax for selecting elements and extracting text.\n\nFirst, you'll need to install `goquery` if you haven't already:\n\n```sh\ngo get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery\n```\n\nThen, you can use it like this:\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery\"\n)\n\nfunc extractText(html []byte) string {\n    doc, err := goquery.NewDocumentFromReader(bytes.NewReader(html))\n    if err != nil {\n        // Handle error\n        return \"\"\n    }\n    return doc.Find(\"body\").Text()\n}\n```\n\nThis function creates a new `goquery.Document` from the HTML content and then extracts the text from the `<body>` element.\n\n**Step 3: Split the text into words.**\n\nOnce we have the text, we need to split it into individual words. In Go, we can use the `strings` package to split the text by spaces and other separators.\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc splitWords(text string) []string {\n    // Split the text into words using space as delimiter\n    words := strings.Fields(text)\n    return words\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Count the frequency of each word.**\n\nTo count the frequency of each word, we can use a map where the keys are words and the values are their counts.\n\n```go\nfunc countWords(words []string) map[string]int {\n    wordCount := make(map[string]int)\n    for _, word := range words {\n        wordCount[word]++\n    }\n    return wordCount\n}\n```\n\n**Step 5: Sort the words by frequency in descending order.**\n\nGo doesn't have built-in support for sorting maps, but we can convert the map into a slice of key-value pairs and then sort that slice.\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"sort\"\n)\n\ntype wordFrequency struct {\n    Word  string\n    Count int\n}\n\nfunc sortWordFrequency(wordCount map[string]int) []*wordFrequency {\n    freqList := make([]*wordFrequency, 0, len(wordCount))\n    for word, count := range wordCount {\n        freqList = append(freqList, &wordFrequency{Word: word, Count: count})\n    }\n    sort.Slice(freqList, func(i, j int) bool {\n        return freqList[i].Count > freqList[j].Count\n    })\n    return freqList\n}\n```\n\n**Step 6: Print the results.**\n\nFinally, we can iterate over the sorted list and print each word with its frequency.\n\n```go\nfunc printFrequency(freqList []*wordFrequency) {\n    for _, wf := range freqList {\n        fmt.Printf(\"%s: %d\\n\", wf.Word, wf.Count)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's put all these functions together into a main function that takes a URL as a command-line argument, performs all the steps, and prints the word frequencies.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"bytes\"\n    \"flag\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io/ioutil\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"sort\"\n    \"strings\"\n\n    \"github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery\"\n)\n\nfunc fetchHTML(url string) ([]byte, error) {\n    response, err := http.Get(url)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    defer response.Body.Close()\n    return ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)\n}\n\nfunc extractText(html []byte) string {\n    doc, err := goquery.NewDocumentFromReader(bytes.NewReader(html))\n    if err != nil {\n        // Handle error\n        return \"\"\n    }\n    return doc.Find(\"body\").Text()\n}\n\nfunc splitWords(text string) []string {\n    words := strings.Fields(text)\n    return words\n}\n\nfunc countWords(words []string) map[string]int {\n    wordCount := make(map[string]int)\n    for _, word := range words {\n        wordCount[word]++\n    }\n    return wordCount\n}\n\ntype wordFrequency struct {\n    Word  string\n    Count int\n}\n\nfunc sortWordFrequency(wordCount map[string]int) []*wordFrequency {\n    freqList := make([]*wordFrequency, 0, len(wordCount))\n    for word, count := range wordCount {\n        freqList = append(freqList, &wordFrequency{Word: word, Count: count})\n    }\n    sort.Slice(freqList, func(i, j int) bool {\n        return freqList[i].Count > freqList[j].Count\n    })\n    return freqList\n}\n\nfunc printFrequency(freqList []*wordFrequency) {\n    for _, wf := range freqList {\n        fmt.Printf(\"%s: %d\\n\", wf.Word, wf.Count)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    urlPtr := flag.String(\"url\", \"\", \"URL to scrape\")\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    if *urlPtr == \"\" {\n        fmt.Println(\"Please provide a URL using -url flag.\")\n        return\n    }\n\n    html, err := fetchHTML(*urlPtr)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error fetching URL: %s\\n\", err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    text := extractText(html)\n    words := splitWords(text)\n    wordCount := countWords(words)\n    freqList := sortWordFrequency(wordCount)\n    printFrequency(freqList)\n}\n```\n\nThis should be a basic web scraper in Go that fetches a URL, extracts the text, counts word frequencies, sorts them, and prints them out.\n\n**Some considerations:**\n\n- **Error handling:** In a production-level application, you should handle errors more gracefully, perhaps by logging them or providing more user-friendly error messages.\n\n- **Concurrency:** If you need to scrape multiple URLs, consider using Go's concurrency features like goroutines and channels to speed up the process.\n\n- **Robustness:** This scraper is very basic and may not handle all edge cases, such as different character encodings, JavaScript-rendered content, or URLs that require authentication.\n\n- **Performance:** For large HTML documents, you might need to optimize the way you read and process the content to avoid memory issues.\n\n- **Command-line flags:** Using `flag` package to accept URL as a command-line argument makes the scraper more flexible.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with your web scraper in Go!
