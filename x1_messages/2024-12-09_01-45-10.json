        "content": "So I have this probability question here: \"In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing two consecutive cards of the same suit without replacement?\" Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. The problem is asking for the probability that the first two cards drawn are of the same suit, and it specifies \"without replacement,\" which means the first card drawn is not put back into the deck before the second card is drawn.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw two cards from a deck of 52 without replacement.\n\nThe number of ways to draw the first card is 52, since there are 52 cards to choose from. After drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. So, the total number of possible outcomes for drawing two cards in sequence without replacement is 52 \u00d7 51.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, which are the scenarios where both cards are of the same suit. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, we draw the first card. It can be any card from the deck, so there are 52 possibilities for the first card. Once we've drawn the first card, we need the second card to be of the same suit as the first one.\n\nSince there are 4 suits, and each suit has 13 cards, if the first card is, say, a heart, then there are 12 hearts left in the deck (since we've already drawn one heart). Similarly, if the first card is a diamond, there would be 12 diamonds left, and so on for the other suits.\n\nSo, regardless of which suit the first card is, there are always 12 cards of the same suit left in the remaining 51 cards.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes for the second card is 12, given that the first card has already been drawn and is of a specific suit.\n\nThus, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I have this right. The total number of possible outcomes for drawing two cards in sequence without replacement is 52 \u00d7 51.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is 52 (for the first card) times 12 (for the second card, given that it has to be of the same suit as the first card).\n\nSo, the probability should be (52 \u00d7 12) / (52 \u00d7 51).\n\nSimplifying that, the 52s cancel out, leaving 12 / 51.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit too high. Let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it this way: after drawing the first card, which can be any card, the second card needs to be of the same suit as the first one. Since there are 51 cards left in the deck, and 12 of them are of the same suit as the first card, the probability should indeed be 12 / 51.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability that the second card matches the suit of the first card.\n\nThe first card can be any suit, so its suit is fixed. Then, the probability that the second card is of that same suit is the number of remaining cards of that suit divided by the total number of remaining cards.\n\nAs we've established, that's 12 / 51.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the combinations instead of permutations, since the order doesn't matter in terms of suits.\n\nWait, but in this case, the order does matter because we're drawing sequentially without replacement.\n\nWait no, actually, in terms of suits, order doesn't matter; we just need both cards to be of the same suit.\n\nBut since we're drawing without replacement, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability that the second card is of the same suit as the first one.\n\nWait, that's essentially what I did earlier.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's consider that there are 4 suits, each with 13 cards.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two cards of the same suit is the number of ways to choose a suit, multiplied by the number of ways to choose two cards from that suit.\n\nSo, that would be 4 (suits) \u00d7 (13 choose 2).\n\n\"13 choose 2\" is the number of ways to choose 2 cards from 13, which is (13 \u00d7 12) / 2 = 78.\n\nSo, total number of favorable outcomes is 4 \u00d7 78 = 312.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any two cards from 52 is \"52 choose 2,\" which is (52 \u00d7 51) / 2 = 1326.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 312 / 1326.\n\nSimplifying that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 12.\n\n312 \u00f7 12 = 26, and 1326 \u00f7 12 = 110.5. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I miscalculated the division.\n\nLet me try dividing both by 6 instead.\n\n312 \u00f7 6 = 52, and 1326 \u00f7 6 = 221.\n\nSo, 52 / 221 is the simplified fraction.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 12 / 51, which simplifies to 4 / 17.\n\nAre these equivalent?\n\nLet's see: 52 / 221 divided numerator and denominator by 13: 52 \u00f7 13 = 4, and 221 \u00f7 13 = 17, so it's 4 / 17.\n\nSimilarly, 12 / 51 simplifies to 4 / 17.\n\nOkay, so both approaches give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 4 / 17.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 12 / 51, which is indeed equal to 4 / 17.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is 4 / 17.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I consider the first card drawn; it can be any card, so its suit is fixed.\n\nThen, the probability that the second card matches that suit is 12 / 51, as we've said.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that after drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left, and 12 of them are of the same suit as the first card.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 12 / 51, which simplifies to 4 / 17.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that no matter what the first card is, the chance that the second card matches its suit is the same.\n\nSo, again, it confirms that the probability is 4 / 17.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that I might be missing.\n\nIs there any dependency or condition that I haven't accounted for?\n\nI don't think so. The draws are without replacement, and the suits are independent in terms of distribution initially.\n\nWait, but actually, the suits are not independent because once cards are drawn, the composition of suits changes.\n\nBut in this specific case, since we're only drawing two cards, and we're considering the second card relative to the first, I think the approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we were drawing more cards, we might need to consider more complex dependencies, but for two cards, this should be fine.\n\nLet me see if I can find a general formula for this kind of problem.\n\nIn general, the probability that two consecutive draws without replacement are of the same suit from a standard deck is given by the formula:\n\nP(same suit) = (number of ways to choose two cards of the same suit) / (total number of ways to choose any two cards)\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier: (4 \u00d7 (13 choose 2)) / (52 choose 2) = (4 \u00d7 78) / 1326 = 312 / 1326 = 4 / 17.\n\nAlternatively, considering the sequential draws: P(second card matches first) = 12 / 51 = 4 / 17.\n\nBoth methods agree, so I'm confident that the answer is 4 / 17.\n\nLet me just double-check the arithmetic to be sure.\n\nStarting with 52 cards, after drawing one card, there are 51 left.\n\nIf the first card is of a particular suit, there are 12 remaining cards of that suit.\n\nSo, P(second card matches first) = 12 / 51.\n\nSimplifying 12 / 51 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 4 / 17.\n\nSimilarly, using combinations: (4 \u00d7 78) / 1326 = 312 / 1326.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 12: 26 / 110.5, which doesn't make sense because 110.5 is not an integer.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me recalculate the combination approach.\n\n\"13 choose 2\" is (13 \u00d7 12) / 2 = 78.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, 4 suits \u00d7 78 = 312 favorable pairs.\n\nTotal pairs: \"52 choose 2\" = (52 \u00d7 51) / 2 = 1326.\n\nSo, P = 312 / 1326.\n\nNow, to simplify 312 / 1326, divide numerator and denominator by 12: 312 \u00f7 12 = 26, 1326 \u00f7 12 = 110.5.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1326 \u00f7 12 is not an integer.\n\nLet me try dividing by 6 instead: 312 \u00f7 6 = 52, 1326 \u00f7 6 = 221.\n\nSo, 52 / 221.\n\nNow, 52 and 221 are both divisible by 13: 52 \u00f7 13 = 4, 221 \u00f7 13 = 17.\n\nThus, 4 / 17.\n\nAlternatively, going back to 12 / 51, which simplifies directly to 4 / 17.\n\nSo, both methods confirm the answer is 4 / 17.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nFor example, does \"consecutive\" imply anything else, like order or specific positions?\n\nI don't think so. The problem seems straightforward: draw two cards in sequence without replacement, and find the probability they are of the same suit.\n\nWe've accounted for that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the deck is shuffled properly, but I assume it is, as it's a standard deck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to think about conditional probability here.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet A be the event that the first card is of a certain suit (doesn't matter which), and B be the event that the second card is of the same suit as the first.\n\nWe want P(B|A), the probability that the second card matches the first given that the first card has been drawn.\n\nFrom conditional probability, P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A).\n\nBut P(A) is 1, since the first card can be any suit.\n\nTherefore, P(B|A) = P(A and B) / 1 = P(A and B).\n\nBut P(A and B) is the probability that both cards are of the same suit, which is what we've calculated as 4 / 17.\n\nSo, this aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using permutations would be another way to approach this.\n\nThe number of permutations of two cards from 52 is 52 \u00d7 51.\n\nThe number of permutations where both cards are of the same suit is 4 \u00d7 (13 \u00d7 12), since there are 4 suits, and for each suit, there are 13 choices for the first card and 12 for the second.\n\nSo, total favorable permutations: 4 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 = 624.\n\nTotal possible permutations: 52 \u00d7 51 = 2652.\n\nTherefore, P = 624 / 2652.\n\nSimplifying: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 12: 624 \u00f7 12 = 52, 2652 \u00f7 12 = 221.\n\nSo, 52 / 221, which simplifies to 4 / 17, again confirming our previous result.\n\nI think it's clear now that the probability is indeed 4 / 17.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, let's consider the probability of drawing two cards of different suits.\n\nThis should be 1 - P(same suit) = 1 - 4 / 17 = 13 / 17.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate it directly.\n\nThe number of ways to draw two cards of different suits.\n\nFirst, choose two different suits: (4 choose 2) = 6.\n\nThen, choose one card from each suit: 13 choices from the first suit and 13 from the second.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes: 6 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 13 = 1014.\n\nWait, but this seems off because the total number of possible outcomes is 52 \u00d7 51 = 2652.\n\nSo, P(different suits) = 1014 / 2652.\n\nSimplifying: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 6: 1014 \u00f7 6 = 169, 2652 \u00f7 6 = 442.\n\nSo, 169 / 442.\n\nCan this be simplified further? Let's see: 169 \u00f7 13 = 13, and 442 \u00f7 13 = 34.\n\nSo, 13 / 34.\n\nBut earlier, we had P(different suits) = 13 / 17.\n\nWait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of ways to draw two cards of different suits.\n\nLet me re-examine this.\n\nIf I choose two different suits, there are (4 choose 2) = 6 ways to choose which two suits will be represented.\n\nThen, for each pair of suits, I can choose one card from each suit: 13 choices from the first suit and 13 from the second, so 13 \u00d7 13 = 169.\n\nTherefore, total favorable outcomes: 6 \u00d7 169 = 1014.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 52 \u00d7 51 = 2652.\n\nTherefore, P(different suits) = 1014 / 2652 = 13 / 34, as simplified earlier.\n\nBut previously, I thought P(different suits) should be 1 - P(same suit) = 1 - 4 / 17 = 13 / 17.\n\nBut according to this calculation, it's 13 / 34.\n\nThis indicates an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait a minute, I think I see the mistake.\n\nWhen calculating the number of ways to draw two cards of different suits, considering (4 choose 2) \u00d7 13\u00b2, that only accounts for the cases where the two cards are from exactly two different suits.\n\nHowever, to get the total number of ways to draw two cards of different suits, we need to consider that the first card can be from any suit, and the second card from any of the remaining three suits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me calculate P(different suits) directly.\n\nThe first card can be any card: 52 choices.\n\nThe second card must be from a different suit than the first.\n\nGiven that the first card is from a specific suit, there are 39 cards left that are from different suits (since there are 51 cards left, and 12 are from the same suit).\n\nTherefore, P(different suits) = (52 \u00d7 39) / (52 \u00d7 51) = 39 / 51 = 13 / 17.\n\nAh, here it is.\n\nSo, P(different suits) = 39 / 51 = 13 / 17.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I tried to calculate it as (4 choose 2) \u00d7 13\u00b2 / (52 \u00d7 51), I got 13 / 34.\n\nThat means my initial approach was incorrect.\n\nThe mistake was in considering only pairs where the two cards are from exactly two different suits, but that doesn't account for all possibilities of different suits.\n\nActually, to get the total number of ways to draw two cards of different suits, it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor the first card, it can be any card (52 choices).\n\nFor the second card, it must be from a different suit than the first (39 choices, since there are 39 cards from the other three suits).\n\nTherefore, total favorable outcomes: 52 \u00d7 39.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 52 \u00d7 51.\n\nTherefore, P(different suits) = (52 \u00d7 39) / (52 \u00d7 51) = 39 / 51 = 13 / 17.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation of P(same suit) = 4 / 17, since 1 - 4 / 17 = 13 / 17.\n\nSo, the correct probability of drawing two cards of different suits is 13 / 17, not 13 / 34.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach using (4 choose 2) \u00d7 13\u00b2 was incorrect for this scenario.\n\nIt's important to consider the correct way to count the favorable outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of drawing two consecutive cards of the same suit without replacement from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is 4 / 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{17}} \\]"
