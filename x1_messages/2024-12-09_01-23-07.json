        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about marbles and probability. So, there's a bag with 8 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 7 green marbles. I need to find the probability of drawing one marble of each color when I draw three marbles at random without replacement.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of ways to draw three marbles from the bag. Then, I need to find out how many of those ways include one marble of each color. Finally, the probability will be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet me start by finding the total number of ways to draw three marbles from the bag. There are altogether 8 red + 5 blue + 7 green = 20 marbles in the bag. Since the order in which I draw the marbles doesn't matter (it's combinations, not permutations), I'll use the combination formula.\n\nThe combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 20 is C(20, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1140.\n\nSo, there are 1140 possible ways to draw three marbles from the bag.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to draw one marble of each color. That means one red, one blue, and one green marble.\n\nSince the marbles are distinct by color, I can calculate the number of ways to choose one red, one blue, and one green separately, and then multiply those together.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red marble from eight is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one blue marble from five is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one green marble from seven is C(7, 1) = 7.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n8 \u00d7 5 = 40\n\n40 \u00d7 7 = 280.\n\nSo, there are 280 ways to draw one marble of each color.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 280 / 1140.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 20.\n\n280 \u00f7 20 = 14\n\n1140 \u00f7 20 = 57\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 14/57.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as a decimal. Let me calculate that.\n\n280 divided by 1140 is approximately 0.2456.\n\nSo, the probability is about 0.2456, or 24.56%.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify the format, I'll go with the fraction 14/57.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer?\n\nMaybe I can think about the probability step by step, considering that the draws are without replacement.\n\nSo, first draw: probability of getting any color is 1, since there are no restrictions.\n\nBut actually, without replacement means that each draw affects the next one.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the probability of drawing one of each color in a specific order, and then multiply by the number of possible orders.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to draw one red, one blue, and one green in a specific order, say red first, then blue, then green.\n\nProbability of first marble being red: 8/20.\n\nThen, probability of second marble being blue: 5/19 (since one red marble has already been drawn, total marbles left are 19).\n\nThen, probability of third marble being green: 7/18 (now two marbles have been drawn, total marbles left are 18).\n\nSo, probability for this specific order is (8/20) \u00d7 (5/19) \u00d7 (7/18).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 8/20 = 0.4\n\nThen, 0.4 \u00d7 5/19 = 0.4 \u00d7 0.2632 = 0.1053\n\nThen, 0.1053 \u00d7 7/18 \u2248 0.1053 \u00d7 0.3889 \u2248 0.0408\n\nSo, the probability for this specific order is approximately 0.0408.\n\nBut there are other orders in which I can draw one of each color. Specifically, there are 3! = 6 possible orders: RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BGR, BRG.\n\nWait, no. Since we have three distinct colors, the number of permutations is 3! = 6.\n\nSo, total probability is 6 \u00d7 0.0408 \u2248 0.2448, which is approximately the same as before, 0.2456.\n\nThe slight difference is due to rounding errors in the calculations.\n\nSo, this confirms that my initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it without decimals.\n\nSo, probability for one specific order is (8/20) \u00d7 (5/19) \u00d7 (7/18).\n\nMultiplying these fractions:\n\nNumerator: 8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 280\n\nDenominator: 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 = 6840\n\nSo, probability for one specific order is 280/6840.\n\nNow, since there are 6 possible orders, total probability is 6 \u00d7 (280/6840) = 1680 / 6840.\n\nSimplifying that fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 40: 1680 \u00f7 40 = 42, 6840 \u00f7 40 = 171.\n\nSo, 42/171.\n\nFurther simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 42 \u00f7 3 = 14, 171 \u00f7 3 = 57.\n\nSo, again, 14/57.\n\nThis matches my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 14/57.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a decimal or a percentage, but 14/57 is likely the most precise form.\n\nSo, the final answer is 14/57.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{57}} \\]"
