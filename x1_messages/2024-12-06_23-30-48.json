        "content": "So the company has 250 employees and they want to reduce their workforce by 12%. I need to find out how many employees will be left after this reduction.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 12% of 250 is. To calculate that, I can multiply 250 by 12% or 0.12.\n\nSo, 250 multiplied by 0.12 is... let me do the math.\n\n250 \u00d7 0.12 = 30.\n\nSo, 12% of 250 is 30 employees.\n\nNow, to find out how many employees will be left after the reduction, I need to subtract those 30 employees from the original 250.\n\n250 - 30 = 220.\n\nTherefore, after reducing the workforce by 12%, there will be 220 employees left.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 250 employees, reducing by 12% means removing 30 employees, which leaves 220 employees. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as keeping 88% of the employees, since 100% - 12% = 88%.\n\nSo, 250 multiplied by 0.88 should also give me the number of employees left.\n\nLet me calculate that to confirm.\n\n250 \u00d7 0.88 = 220.\n\nYes, same result. So, either way, the company will have 220 employees after reducing the workforce by 12%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{220} \\]"
