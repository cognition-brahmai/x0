        "content": "Sure! I can help you design a simple REST API server in Node.js with GET, POST, and DELETE endpoints for managing a list of users. We'll use Express.js, which is a popular framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.\n\nOnce you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**\n\n   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new directory for your project and initialize it:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir user-api\n   cd user-api\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Express.js:**\n\n   Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Install it using npm:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install express\n   ```\n\n3. **Create the server file:**\n\n   Create a new file called `server.js` in your project directory. This file will contain the code for your API server.\n\n4. **Set up the basic server structure:**\n\n   Open `server.js` and set up a basic Express server:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n   const port = 3000;\n\n   app.listen(port, () => {\n     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n5. **Parse JSON bodies:**\n\n   Since you'll be working with JSON data, you need to parse the request bodies. Add the following line above your route definitions:\n\n   ```javascript\n   app.use(express.json());\n   ```\n\n6. **Define the user data store:**\n\n   For simplicity, we'll use an in-memory array to store user data. In a real-world application, you'd use a database.\n\n   ```javascript\n   let users = [];\n   let idCounter = 1;\n   ```\n\n7. **Create the GET endpoint:**\n\n   This endpoint will retrieve all users or a specific user by ID.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Get all users\n   app.get('/users', (req, res) => {\n     res.json(users);\n   });\n\n   // Get a single user by ID\n   app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {\n     const userId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n     const user = users.find(u => u.id === userId);\n     if (user) {\n       res.json(user);\n     } else {\n       res.status(404).json({ message: 'User not found' });\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n\n8. **Create the POST endpoint:**\n\n   This endpoint will create a new user.\n\n   ```javascript\n   app.post('/users', (req, res) => {\n     const { name, email } = req.body;\n     if (!name || !email) {\n       return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Name and email are required' });\n     }\n     const newUser = { id: idCounter++, name, email };\n     users.push(newUser);\n     res.status(201).json(newUser);\n   });\n   ```\n\n9. **Create the DELETE endpoint:**\n\n   This endpoint will delete a user by ID.\n\n   ```javascript\n   app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {\n     const userId = parseInt(req.params.id);\n     const index = users.findIndex(u => u.id === userId);\n     if (index !== -1) {\n       users.splice(index, 1);\n       res.status(204).send();\n     } else {\n       res.status(404).json({ message: 'User not found' });\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n\n10. **Run the server:**\n\n    Save your changes and run the server using the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    node server.js\n    ```\n\n    Your server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.\n\n11. **Test the API:**\n\n    You can use tools like Postman or curl to test your API endpoints.\n\n    - **GET all users:**\n\n      ```bash\n      curl http://localhost:3000/users\n      ```\n\n    - **GET a single user by ID:**\n\n      ```bash\n      curl http://localhost:3000/users/1\n      ```\n\n    - **POST a new user:**\n\n      ```bash\n      curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"email\":\"john@example.com\"}'\n      ```\n\n    - **DELETE a user by ID:**\n\n      ```bash\n      curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/users/1\n      ```\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple REST API server in Node.js with Express.js that manages a list of users using GET, POST, and DELETE endpoints. This should give you a good starting point for building more complex APIs."
