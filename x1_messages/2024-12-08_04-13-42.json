It's often called \"The Land Down Under\" because of its location in the southern hemisphere, relatively below many other countries on the globe. Australia is unique in that it's both the smallest continent and the largest country in terms of land area in Oceania. It's known for its diverse landscapes, from the Great Barrier Reef to the Outback, and its rich cultural heritage. Is there anything specific you'd like to know about Australia?"
