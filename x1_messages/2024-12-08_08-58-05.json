        "content": "To find the average speed of the train for the entire journey, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.\n\nFirst, let's find the total distance. The train travels from Town A to Town B, which is 150 miles, and then from Town B to Town C, which is 200 miles. So, the total distance is:\n\nTotal distance = 150 miles + 200 miles = 350 miles\n\nNext, let's find the total time taken. The train takes 3 hours to travel from Town A to Town B and 4 hours to travel from Town B to Town C. So, the total time is:\n\nTotal time = 3 hours + 4 hours = 7 hours\n\nNow, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nAverage speed = 350 miles / 7 hours = 50 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the train for the entire journey is 50 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
