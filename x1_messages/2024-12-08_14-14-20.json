        "content": "So the national park wants to build 50 more miles of hiking trails. They have two years to do this, and each mile costs $15,000 to build. They get $500,000 per year from the government for infrastructure improvements. I need to figure out if they can finish the trail expansion within their budget and the timeframe.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total cost of the new trails. If each mile costs $15,000 and they're adding 50 miles, then the total cost would be:\n\nTotal cost = 50 miles * $15,000 per mile\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n50 * 15,000 = 750,000\n\nSo, the total cost is $750,000.\n\nNow, they get $500,000 per year for two years. So, the total funding they'll receive over two years is:\n\nTotal funding = $500,000 per year * 2 years\n\nThat's:\n\n500,000 * 2 = 1,000,000\n\nSo, they have $1,000,000 over two years.\n\nComparing the total cost to the total funding:\n\nTotal funding ($1,000,000) is greater than total cost ($750,000).\n\nSo, yes, they can complete the trail expansion within their budget and timeframe.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if they can do it within the annual budget limits. Maybe they can't spend the entire two years' funding at once.\n\nLet me see. If they get $500,000 per year, and the project costs $750,000, they might need to spread the spending over two years.\n\nIn year one, they spend $500,000, and in year two, they spend the remaining $250,000.\n\nThat way, they don't exceed their annual budget.\n\nSo, in year one, $500,000 spent on trails.\n\nAt $15,000 per mile, the number of miles they can build in year one is:\n\nMiles in year one = $500,000 / $15,000 per mile\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n500,000 / 15,000 = 33.333... miles\n\nBut they can't build a fraction of a mile, so maybe they plan to build 33 miles in the first year and the remaining in the second year.\n\nWait, but 33 miles times $15,000 is:\n\n33 * 15,000 = 495,000\n\nSo, they spend $495,000 in year one on 33 miles.\n\nThen, in year two, they need to build the remaining miles.\n\nTotal miles to build: 50\n\nMiles built in year one: 33\n\nRemaining miles: 50 - 33 = 17 miles\n\nCost for year two: 17 miles * $15,000 per mile\n\n17 * 15,000 = 255,000\n\nSo, in year two, they need $255,000.\n\nBut their annual funding is $500,000, which covers the $255,000.\n\nSo, over two years, they can build all 50 miles within their budget.\n\nAlternatively, if they choose to build more in the first year and less in the second, as long as the total spending doesn't exceed $500,000 per year, it's feasible.\n\nFor example, if they build 40 miles in year one:\n\n40 * 15,000 = 600,000\n\nBut their budget is only $500,000, so that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, they need to build no more than $500,000 worth of trails each year.\n\nSo, in year one, maximum miles:\n\nMaximum miles year one = $500,000 / $15,000 per mile\n\nWhich is approximately 33.33 miles, as before.\n\nThen in year two, they can build the remaining 17 miles for $255,000.\n\nSo, yes, they can complete the project within two years and within their budget.\n\nIn fact, they have some funding left over.\n\nTotal funding: $1,000,000\n\nTotal cost: $750,000\n\nLeftover funding: $1,000,000 - $750,000 = $250,000\n\nThey could use the leftover funding for other infrastructure improvements.\n\nAlternatively, if there are additional costs not accounted for in the initial estimate, they have a buffer.\n\nBut based on the information provided, the park can complete the trail expansion within their budget and timeframe.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, the park can complete the trail expansion within their budget and timeframe.}} \\]"
