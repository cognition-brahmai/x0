        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual revenue of $5 million. It spends 40% on salaries, 25% on rent, and 15% on marketing. I need to find out how much money is left after these expenses.\n\nFirst, I should calculate each expense based on the percentage of the revenue.\n\nSalaries: 40% of $5 million\n\nRent: 25% of $5 million\n\nMarketing: 15% of $5 million\n\nThen, I'll add up these expenses and subtract the total from the revenue to find out what's left.\n\nLet me start with salaries. 40% of $5 million is calculated as:\n\n0.40 * 5,000,000 = 2,000,000\n\nSo, salaries cost $2 million.\n\nNext, rent is 25% of $5 million:\n\n0.25 * 5,000,000 = 1,250,000\n\nRent is $1.25 million.\n\nThen, marketing is 15% of $5 million:\n\n0.15 * 5,000,000 = 750,000\n\nMarketing costs $750,000.\n\nNow, I'll add up these expenses:\n\nSalaries: $2,000,000\n\nRent: $1,250,000\n\nMarketing: $750,000\n\nTotal expenses = 2,000,000 + 1,250,000 + 750,000 = 4,000,000\n\nSo, total expenses are $4 million.\n\nNow, subtract the total expenses from the revenue:\n\nRevenue: $5,000,000\n\nExpenses: $4,000,000\n\nMoney left: 5,000,000 - 4,000,000 = 1,000,000\n\nTherefore, the company has $1 million left after these expenses.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate this? Maybe by finding the percentage of revenue left after these expenses.\n\nLet's see, total percentage spent is 40% (salaries) + 25% (rent) + 15% (marketing) = 80%\n\nSo, 80% of the revenue is spent, which means 20% is left.\n\nLet's calculate 20% of $5 million:\n\n0.20 * 5,000,000 = 1,000,000\n\nThat matches the earlier result of $1 million.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could verify by calculating each expense again and ensuring the addition and subtraction are correct.\n\nSalaries: 40% of $5 million = $2 million\n\nRent: 25% of $5 million = $1.25 million\n\nMarketing: 15% of $5 million = $750,000\n\nTotal expenses: $2,000,000 + $1,250,000 + $750,000 = $4,000,000\n\nRevenue minus expenses: $5,000,000 - $4,000,000 = $1,000,000\n\nYes, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 40% + 25% + 15% = 80% is spent, so 100% - 80% = 20% is left.\n\n20% of $5 million is indeed $1 million.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, the answer is $1 million.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nIs there any other aspect to this problem? Maybe considering that some expenses are not included, but according to the question, only salaries, rent, and marketing are mentioned.\n\nAssuming there are no other expenses, the company has $1 million left.\n\nBut in reality, companies have other expenses like utilities, taxes, supplies, etc. But based on the information provided, we only account for salaries, rent, and marketing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $1 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000000} \\]"
