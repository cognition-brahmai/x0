        "content": "Let's see, I need to find out how many factors the number 60 has. Factors are the numbers that can divide 60 completely without leaving a remainder. So, I guess I can start by listing all the numbers that divide 60.\n\nFirst, 1 is always a factor of any number, so 1 is a factor of 60.\n\nNext, 2 divides 60 because 60 is an even number. 60 divided by 2 is 30, so 2 and 30 are factors.\n\nThen, 3 divides 60 because the sum of the digits of 60 is 6, which is divisible by 3. 60 divided by 3 is 20, so 3 and 20 are factors.\n\n4 divides 60 because 60 divided by 4 is 15, so 4 and 15 are factors.\n\n5 divides 60 because 60 ends with a 0, which means it's divisible by 5. 60 divided by 5 is 12, so 5 and 12 are factors.\n\n6 divides 60 because both 2 and 3 divide 60, and 6 is 2 times 3. 60 divided by 6 is 10, so 6 and 10 are factors.\n\n7 doesn't divide 60 because 60 divided by 7 is approximately 8.57, which is not a whole number.\n\n8 doesn't divide 60 because 60 divided by 8 is 7.5, which is not a whole number.\n\n9 doesn't divide 60 because 60 divided by 9 is approximately 6.666, which is not a whole number.\n\n10 divides 60 because 60 divided by 10 is 6, but I already have 10 as a factor from earlier.\n\n11 doesn't divide 60 because 60 divided by 11 is approximately 5.45, which is not a whole number.\n\n12 divides 60 because 60 divided by 12 is 5, but I already have 12 as a factor.\n\nSo, I have the factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.\n\nLet me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. That's 12 factors.\n\nWait a minute, is there a more systematic way to find the number of factors without listing them all out? I think there is a method using the prime factorization of the number.\n\nLet's try that. First, find the prime factors of 60.\n\n60 can be divided by 2: 60 \u00f7 2 = 30.\n\n30 can be divided by 2: 30 \u00f7 2 = 15.\n\n15 can be divided by 3: 15 \u00f7 3 = 5.\n\n5 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 60 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5, which can be written as 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b9 \u00d7 5\u00b9.\n\nNow, to find the number of factors, I can use the exponents in the prime factorization. The formula is to add 1 to each of the exponents and then multiply them together.\n\nSo, for 2\u00b2, the exponent is 2, add 1: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nFor 3\u00b9, the exponent is 1, add 1: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nFor 5\u00b9, the exponent is 1, add 1: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow, multiply them together: 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 12.\n\nSo, according to this method, 60 has 12 factors, which matches what I found earlier by listing them out.\n\nThis seems like a more efficient way, especially for larger numbers. I should remember this method.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss any factors.\n\nStarting with 1 and 60, then 2 and 30, 3 and 20, 4 and 15, 5 and 12, 6 and 10. That's all the pairs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.\n\nNo duplicates or omissions, so yes, 12 factors.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. The number 60 has 12 factors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
