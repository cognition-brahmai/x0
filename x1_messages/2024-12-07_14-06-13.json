Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mixture of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nYahooSearch[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the Yahoo search engine. This tool is useful in finding a suitable list of sites that may or may not include the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Reads one or more websites from the input string containing newline separated links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkSelector[input]: Selects links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question answering language model, especially useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., How tall is the Eiffel Tower, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAModel[Who invented the telephone, given :evidence2:?]\n\nBe sure to only include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who discovered penicillin and what were its initial uses?"
