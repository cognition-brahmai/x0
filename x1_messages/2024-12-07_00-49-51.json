        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1000 units every day. On Monday, there were 200 defective units, and on Tuesday, 150 defective units. I need to find out what percentage of the products produced over both days were defective.\n\nFirst, I should find out the total number of units produced over both days. Since the factory produces 1000 units each day, for two days it would be:\n\n1000 units/day * 2 days = 2000 units\n\nNext, I need to find out the total number of defective units over both days. On Monday, there were 200 defective units, and on Tuesday, 150 defective units. So, the total defective units are:\n\n200 + 150 = 350 defective units\n\nNow, to find the percentage of defective units out of the total units produced, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage defective = (number of defective units / total units produced) * 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage defective = (350 / 2000) * 100%\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n350 divided by 2000 is 0.175\n\nThen, 0.175 multiplied by 100% is 17.5%\n\nSo, 17.5% of the products produced on both days were defective.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal units produced: 1000 units/day * 2 days = 2000 units\n\nTotal defective units: 200 + 150 = 350 units\n\nPercentage defective: (350 / 2000) * 100% = 17.5%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently. On Monday, 200 out of 1000 units were defective, which is 20%. On Tuesday, 150 out of 1000 units were defective, which is 15%. To find the average percentage over both days, I could average 20% and 15%, but that might not be accurate because it doesn't consider the total units produced.\n\nWait, no. Since the number of units produced each day is the same, averaging the percentages would give the same result. Let's try that.\n\nAverage percentage defective = (20% + 15%) / 2 = 35% / 2 = 17.5%\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the production quantities were different each day. But in this case, they're the same, so my calculation should be fine.\n\nSo, the final answer is 17.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17.5\\%} \\]"
