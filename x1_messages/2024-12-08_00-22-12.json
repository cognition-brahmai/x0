        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 6 green balls. So, total number of balls is 4 + 5 + 6, which is 15 balls. The question is, if I draw 3 balls at random without replacement, what's the probability that all three balls are different colors?\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what it means to draw without replacement. That means once I pick a ball, it's not going back into the bag, so the total number of balls decreases with each draw.\n\nNow, the event I'm interested in is drawing one ball of each color: red, blue, and green. So, in any order, as long as I have one of each.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to calculate the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 15, and then find out how many of those ways include one ball of each color. Then, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 15 is given by the combination formula: C(15, 3), which is 15 choose 3.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one red, one blue, and one green ball would be C(4,1) * C(5,1) * C(6,1), because I'm choosing one ball from each color group.\n\nThen, the probability is [C(4,1) * C(5,1) * C(6,1)] / C(15,3).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, C(4,1) is 4.\n\nC(5,1) is 5.\n\nC(6,1) is 6.\n\nSo, the numerator is 4 * 5 * 6 = 120.\n\nNow, C(15,3) is (15 * 14 * 13) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 455.\n\nSo, the probability is 120 / 455.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth 120 and 455 are divisible by 5.\n\n120 \u00f7 5 = 24\n\n455 \u00f7 5 = 91\n\nSo, 24/91.\n\nWait, is that the final answer?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the different orders in which I can draw the balls. For example, red first, then blue, then green, or any other order.\n\nBut in the combination approach I used, order doesn't matter, which is appropriate since the problem doesn't specify order.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the permutation approach, but that might complicate things unnecessary.\n\nLet me see.\n\nAnother way is to think step by step.\n\nFirst draw: any ball. For the second draw, it should be a different color than the first, and for the third draw, it should be different from both of the first two.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nI think the combination approach is better.\n\nSo, sticking with that, the probability is 24/91.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if this is correct.\n\nLet me see.\n\nTotal ways to choose 3 balls: C(15,3) = 455.\n\nWays to choose one of each color: C(4,1) * C(5,1) * C(6,1) = 4 * 5 * 6 = 120.\n\nSo, yes, 120/455 = 24/91.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nFirst ball: any color. Probability 1.\n\nSecond ball: different color than the first. Depending on what the first was.\n\nThird ball: different from both previous balls.\n\nBut that seems more messy.\n\nLet me try it that way to confirm.\n\nFirst ball: can be any of the 15 balls.\n\nSecond ball: must be a different color than the first.\n\nIf the first ball is red (4/15 chance), then there are 5 blue + 6 green = 11 balls left that are different colors.\n\nIf the first ball is blue (5/15 chance), then there are 4 red + 6 green = 10 balls left that are different colors.\n\nIf the first ball is green (6/15 chance), then there are 4 red + 5 blue = 9 balls left that are different colors.\n\nSo, the probability for the second ball to be different from the first is:\n\n(4/15)*(11/14) + (5/15)*(10/14) + (6/15)*(9/14)\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst term: (4/15)*(11/14) = 44/210\n\nSecond term: (5/15)*(10/14) = 50/210\n\nThird term: (6/15)*(9/14) = 54/210\n\nAdding them up: 44 + 50 + 54 = 148/210\n\nSimplify 148/210 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 74/105.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is different from the first is 74/105.\n\nNow, given that the first two balls are different colors, what's the probability that the third ball is different from both?\n\nAfter two balls of different colors are drawn, the number of balls left is 13.\n\nThe number of balls that are different from both previous colors depends on what the first two colors were.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the combination approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a error in my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the order doesn't matter in the combination approach, which is fine, since probability is just the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.\n\nSo, I think 24/91 is correct.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the total number of ways to pick one of each color, which is 4 * 5 * 6 = 120, but since the order doesn't matter, I don't need to multiply by 3!.\n\nWait, no, because in combinations, order doesn't matter.\n\nSo, yes, C(4,1)*C(5,1)*C(6,1) = 4*5*6 = 120 is the correct numerator.\n\nDenominator is C(15,3) = 455.\n\nSo, 120/455 = 24/91.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the step-by-step approach again.\n\nFirst ball: can be any color, so probability 1.\n\nSecond ball: must be different from the first.\n\nIf first ball is red (4/15), then second ball can be blue or green: 11/14.\n\nIf first ball is blue (5/15), second ball can be red or green: 10/14.\n\nIf first ball is green (6/15), second ball can be red or blue: 9/14.\n\nSo, the combined probability for the first two balls is:\n\n(4/15)*(11/14) + (5/15)*(10/14) + (6/15)*(9/14) = 44/210 + 50/210 + 54/210 = 148/210 = 74/105.\n\nNow, given that the first two balls are different colors, what's the probability that the third ball is different from both?\n\nAfter drawing two different colored balls, there are 13 balls left, and the number of balls that are different from both previous colors depends on what those colors were.\n\nThis is getting too messy. I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{91}} \\]"
