Each step in your plan should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can call:\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information using a general web search engine. This tool is useful for finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nReadPage[input]: Load a website from the input string and produces plain text output containing the content of the page.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given #E1?\n\nThe input to each function should be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAModel[What is the capital of France, given #E3?]\n\nEnsure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on the input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who was the architect behind the construction of the Eiffel Tower and what other notable structures did they design?"
