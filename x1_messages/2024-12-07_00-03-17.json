        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to creating a Python script that performs bubble sort on a list of integers provided as a comma-separated string:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - Accept a comma-separated string of numbers from the user.\n   - Convert this string into a list of integers.\n\n2. **Bubble Sort Implementation:**\n   - Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort the list in ascending order.\n   - The algorithm works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.\n\n3. **Output the Sorted List:**\n   - Print the sorted list.\n\n### Solution Code:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Track if any swaps are made in this pass\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        # If no two elements were swapped in the inner loop, the list is sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n\ndef main():\n    # Accept input as a comma-separated string\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by commas: \")\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list of integers\n    try:\n        numbers = list(map(int, input_string.split(',')))\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter a valid list of numbers separated by commas.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Perform bubble sort\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n    \n    # Print the sorted list\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The user is prompted to enter a comma-separated string of numbers.\n   - The input string is split by commas, and each part is converted to an integer to form the list.\n\n2. **Bubble Sort Implementation:**\n   - The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of integers as input.\n   - It iterates over the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n   - A flag `swapped` is used to optimize the algorithm by stopping early if no swaps are made in a pass, indicating the list is already sorted.\n\n3. **Output the Sorted List:**\n   - The sorted list is printed to the console.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward implementation of bubble sort and handles basic input validation."
