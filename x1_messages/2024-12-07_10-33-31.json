        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a person who earns $4,000 every month. They save 15% of that income, and the rest they spend on various expenses like rent, utilities, groceries, and other things. We need to find out how much they will have saved after one year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much they save each month. Since they save 15% of their monthly income, I can calculate that by taking 15% of $4,000. To find a percentage of a number, I multiply the number by the percentage (expressed as a decimal). So, 15% is 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nSo, monthly savings = 15% of $4,000 = 0.15 * $4,000.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n0.15 * 4000 = $600.\n\nSo, they save $600 each month.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much they save in one year. There are 12 months in a year, so total savings after one year would be monthly savings multiplied by 12.\n\nTotal savings = $600 * 12.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n$600 * 12 = $7,200.\n\nSo, after one year, they will have saved $7,200.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 15% of $4,000:\n\n15% = 0.15\n\n0.15 * 4000 = $600. That seems correct.\n\nThen, $600 per month for 12 months:\n\n$600 * 12 = $7,200. That also seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how much they spend each month and see if it adds up correctly.\n\nThey earn $4,000 and save $600, so their expenses would be $4,000 - $600 = $3,400 per month.\n\nBut the question is about savings, not expenses, so that's not necessary for the final answer.\n\nWait a minute, the question mentions that they spend the remaining amount on rent, utilities, groceries, and other expenses, but it doesn't ask about the expenses; it asks for the savings after one year, which we've calculated as $7,200.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe considering the annual income.\n\nAnnual income would be $4,000 per month * 12 months = $48,000 per year.\n\nIf they save 15% each month, then annually, they save 15% of $48,000.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n15% of $48,000 = 0.15 * 48,000 = $7,200.\n\nSo, same answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the savings rate stays constant, the total savings after one year should be the monthly savings multiplied by 12, which is again $600 * 12 = $7,200.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $7,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7200} \\]"
