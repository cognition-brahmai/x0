        "content": "So the town's population is increasing by 5% each year, and right now there are 20,000 people living there. I need to find out what the population will be in 3 years. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 5% increase means. Percentage increase is a way to express how much something grows in relation to its original amount. So, a 5% increase means that every year, the population grows by an amount that is 5% of the current population.\n\nLet's denote the current population as P0, which is 20,000. Then, each year, the population for the next year can be calculated by adding 5% of the current year's population to itself. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP_next = P_current + (5/100) * P_current\n\nAlternatively, this can be simplified to:\n\nP_next = P_current * (1 + 0.05)\n\nP_next = P_current * 1.05\n\nSo, each year, the population is multiplied by 1.05.\n\nNow, I need to find the population in 3 years. That means I need to apply this 5% increase three times: once for each year.\n\nLet's calculate it year by year.\n\n**Year 1:**\n\nP1 = P0 * 1.05\n\nP1 = 20,000 * 1.05\n\nTo calculate this, I can multiply 20,000 by 1.05.\n\n20,000 * 1.05 = 20,000 * 1 + 20,000 * 0.05 = 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000\n\nSo, after the first year, the population is 21,000.\n\n**Year 2:**\n\nP2 = P1 * 1.05\n\nP2 = 21,000 * 1.05\n\nAgain, multiply 21,000 by 1.05.\n\n21,000 * 1.05 = 21,000 * 1 + 21,000 * 0.05 = 21,000 + 1,050 = 22,050\n\nSo, after the second year, the population is 22,050.\n\n**Year 3:**\n\nP3 = P2 * 1.05\n\nP3 = 22,050 * 1.05\n\nMultiply 22,050 by 1.05.\n\n22,050 * 1.05 = 22,050 * 1 + 22,050 * 0.05 = 22,050 + 1,102.5 = 23,152.5\n\nSo, after the third year, the population is 23,152.5.\n\nBut population can't be a fraction; you can't have half a person. So, in reality, we would round this to the nearest whole number. Since 0.5 is exactly in the middle, the standard rounding rule would round up to 23,153.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for compound interest, since this is similar to compound growth. The formula for the future value after n periods is:\n\nP_future = P_present * (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- P_future is the future population\n\n- P_present is the current population\n\n- r is the growth rate per period\n\n- n is the number of periods\n\nIn this case:\n\nP_present = 20,000\n\nr = 0.05\n\nn = 3\n\nSo,\n\nP_future = 20,000 * (1 + 0.05)^3\n\nP_future = 20,000 * (1.05)^3\n\nFirst, calculate 1.05 cubed.\n\n1.05^3 = 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05\n\nFirst, 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025\n\nThen, 1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625\n\nSo,\n\nP_future = 20,000 * 1.157625 = 23,152.5\n\nAgain, we get 23,152.5, which rounds to 23,153.\n\nWait a minute, in the first method, I got 23,152.5, and in the second method, I got the same. But in the first method, when I did it year by year, I got 23,152.5, and I thought about rounding up to 23,153. But let's double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIn the first year:\n\n20,000 * 1.05 = 21,000\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSecond year:\n\n21,000 * 1.05 = 22,050\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nThird year:\n\n22,050 * 1.05 = 23,152.5\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUsing the compound interest formula:\n\n20,000 * (1.05)^3 = 20,000 * 1.157625 = 23,152.5\n\nAgain, correct.\n\nSo, the population in 3 years will be approximately 23,153 people.\n\nBut, to be precise, since population must be a whole number, and 0.5 typically rounds up, the final answer is 23,153.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction could be interpreted as half a person, which doesn't make sense, so it's standard to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the population in 3 years will be 23,153.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23153} \\]\n"
