        "content": "Let's see here. So, there's a train leaving from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour, and at the same time, a car leaves from Town B to Town A at 40 miles per hour. The distance between the two towns is 200 miles. The question is, when they meet, which vehicle will be farther from Town A?\n\nHmm, this seems like a relative speed problem. So, the train is going from A to B at 60 mph, and the car is going from B to A at 40 mph. They're leaving at the same time, and the distance between the towns is 200 miles.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out when they meet. I think the best way to do this is to calculate the time it takes for them to meet.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph.\n\nNow, the distance between them is 200 miles, so the time it takes for them to meet is distance divided by relative speed, which is 200 miles / 100 mph = 2 hours.\n\nSo, they meet after 2 hours.\n\nNow, I need to find out how far each vehicle has traveled in 2 hours.\n\nFor the train: speed is 60 mph, time is 2 hours, so distance is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.\n\nFor the car: speed is 40 mph, time is 2 hours, so distance is 40 * 2 = 80 miles.\n\nNow, since the train is going from A to B, and the car is going from B to A, when they meet, the train would have traveled 120 miles from A, and the car would have traveled 80 miles from B.\n\nBut the question is, when they meet, which vehicle will be farther from Town A?\n\nWait a minute, the train has traveled 120 miles from A, so it's 120 miles away from A.\n\nThe car has traveled 80 miles from B, but since the total distance is 200 miles, the car's distance from A would be 200 - 80 = 120 miles.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the car has traveled 80 miles from B, and the total distance is 200 miles, then the car is 200 - 80 = 120 miles from A.\n\nSimilarly, the train has traveled 120 miles from A.\n\nSo, both vehicles are 120 miles from A when they meet.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. If they both meet at a point that's 120 miles from A, then they should be at the same distance from A.\n\nWait, but the car has traveled 80 miles from B, which is 200 - 80 = 120 miles from A, and the train has traveled 120 miles from A.\n\nSo, they meet at a point that's 120 miles from A.\n\nTherefore, both vehicles are at the same point, which is 120 miles from A.\n\nSo, neither is farther from Town A; they are both at the same distance from Town A when they meet.\n\nBut the question is, which vehicle will be farther from Town A when they meet?\n\nAccording to this calculation, they are both at the same distance from Town A, which is 120 miles.\n\nWait, but maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nThe train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering 120 miles from A.\n\nThe car travels at 40 mph for 2 hours, covering 80 miles from B.\n\nSince the total distance is 200 miles, the car's distance from A is 200 - 80 = 120 miles.\n\nSo, both are 120 miles from A.\n\nWait, but the train is 120 miles from A, and the car is also 120 miles from A.\n\nSo, they are at the same point.\n\nTherefore, neither is farther from Town A; they are both equally distant from Town A when they meet.\n\nMaybe the answer is that they are equally distant from Town A when they meet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"When they meet, which vehicle will be farther from Town A?\"\n\nGiven that both are 120 miles from A when they meet, the answer should be that neither is farther; they are both the same distance from Town A.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider their positions differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me into thinking about their positions relative to A.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to consider how far each vehicle has traveled from their starting point.\n\nThe train starts at A and travels 120 miles towards B.\n\nThe car starts at B and travels 80 miles towards A.\n\nWhen they meet, the train is 120 miles from A, and the car is 120 miles from A.\n\nSo, they are both at the same point, 120 miles from A.\n\nTherefore, neither is farther from Town A; they are equally distant from Town A.\n\nI think that's the correct conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Neither; both vehicles are equally distant from Town A when they meet.}} \\]"
