        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a rectangular room measures 12 feet by 18 feet, and I need to find the area of the room in square yards. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that area is calculated by multiplying length by width. So, for a rectangle, area equals length times width. In this case, the length is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet. So, the area in square feet would be 18 feet times 12 feet.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 18 times 12. Well, 10 times 12 is 120, and 8 times 12 is 96. Adding those together, 120 plus 96 is 216. So, the area is 216 square feet.\n\nBut the question asks for the area in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards. I recall that 1 yard equals 3 feet. Therefore, 1 square yard equals 3 feet by 3 feet, which is 9 square feet.\n\nSo, to convert from square feet to square yards, I need to divide the number of square feet by 9, because there are 9 square feet in one square yard.\n\nSo, 216 square feet divided by 9 square feet per square yard equals 24 square yards.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If 1 square yard is 9 square feet, then 24 square yards should be 24 times 9, which is 216 square feet. Yes, that matches the area I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can convert the measurements to yards before multiplying.\n\nLet's see: the room is 12 feet by 18 feet. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, I can convert each dimension to yards.\n\nSo, 12 feet divided by 3 equals 4 yards, and 18 feet divided by 3 equals 6 yards.\n\nNow, multiply those together: 4 yards times 6 yards equals 24 square yards.\n\nOkay, that's the same answer I got earlier. So, that reinforces that 24 square yards is correct.\n\nI think both methods are valid, and they give the same result, which is a good sign that I'm on the right track.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Well, sometimes people get confused between yards and feet, so it's important to keep track of the units.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to understand that since 1 yard is 3 feet, when dealing with area, the conversion factor is squared. So, 1 square yard is 3 feet times 3 feet, which is 9 square feet.\n\nSo, when converting from square feet to square yards, you divide by 9.\n\nSimilarly, if you were converting from square yards to square feet, you would multiply by 9.\n\nIn this problem, we had square feet and needed to convert to square yards, so division by 9 is correct.\n\nLet me also consider if the room dimensions were given in yards to begin with. If the room was, say, 4 yards by 6 yards, then the area would directly be 24 square yards, which matches what I calculated.\n\nBut since the dimensions were given in feet, I had to convert them to yards first, or convert the area from square feet to square yards, and both approaches gave me the same answer.\n\nI feel confident now that 24 square yards is the correct area of the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
