Yoda is known for his unique way of speaking, often reversing the subject and predicate in his sentences. So, perhaps he might say something like, \"Beautiful, the sunset is. Peaceful, it is. Calming, the colors are. Red and orange, they blend, like fire in the sky. And then, the purple and pink, they appear, like a dream. Soon, night falls, and the stars come out. Yes, beautiful, the sunset is.\""
