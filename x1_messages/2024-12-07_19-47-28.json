        "content": "So I've got this problem about a hospital stocking its pharmacy with different medications and there are some bulk discount options. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the hospital is ordering:\n\n- They use 500 units of medication A each month, and each unit costs $10.\n\n- They use 300 units of medication B each month, at $15 per unit.\n\n- And they use 200 units of medication C each month, at $20 per unit.\n\nSo, the first thing I should do is calculate the total number of units they are ordering each month to see if they qualify for the bulk discount.\n\nTotal units = 500 (A) + 300 (B) + 200 (C) = 1000 units.\n\nHmm, the bulk discount is applied if they order more than 1000 units of any combination of these medications. So, since they are ordering exactly 1000 units, do they qualify for the discount or not? The problem says \"more than 1000 units,\" so I think 1000 is not enough. They need to order more than that to get the discount.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a way to interpret this differently. Maybe there are different discount thresholds for different medications or something. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"A large hospital needs to stock its pharmacy with medications for various departments. The hospital uses 500 units of medication A at a cost of $10 per unit, 300 units of medication B at a cost of $15 per unit, and 200 units of medication C at a cost of $20 per unit every month. They receive a bulk discount of 10% if they order more than 1000 units of any combination of these medications.\"\n\nSo, it seems straightforward. They get a 10% discount if the total units ordered across all medications is more than 1000. Since they're ordering exactly 1000 units, they don't qualify for the discount.\n\nBut wait, maybe they can order a little extra to qualify for the discount. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about them wanting to minimize cost or anything like that. It just says to calculate the total monthly cost considering the bulk discount.\n\nSo, I think I should proceed with the assumption that they are ordering exactly 1000 units and don't qualify for the discount.\n\nLet me calculate the total cost without the discount first.\n\nCost of medication A: 500 units * $10/unit = $5,000.\n\nCost of medication B: 300 units * $15/unit = $4,500.\n\nCost of medication C: 200 units * $20/unit = $4,000.\n\nTotal cost without discount: $5,000 + $4,500 + $4,000 = $13,500.\n\nNow, since they are not qualifying for the bulk discount, the total monthly cost is $13,500.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to interpret the bulk discount differently. Maybe it's applied to each medication separately if you order more than 1000 units of that medication. Although that seems unlikely because it says \"any combination of these medications.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the discount applies if the total cost is more than $1000, but no, it specifies \"more than 1000 units.\"\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe they can order more than 1000 units by including additional units of one medication to trigger the discount, but again, the problem doesn't suggest that they are doing that.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that \"more than 1000 units\" includes orders that combine multiple periods, like ordering two months' worth of medications to exceed 1000 units and get the discount, but that seems beyond the scope of the problem.\n\nI think the straightforward interpretation is that they order 1000 units per month, which does not qualify for the discount, so the total monthly cost is $13,500.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the bulk discount.\n\nSuppose the discount applies if any single medication order is more than 1000 units. In that case, none of the individual medications exceed 1000 units, so no discount applies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the total cost exceeding $1000, but the problem specifies \"more than 1000 units of any combination of these medications.\"\n\nGiven that, I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total monthly cost of stocking the pharmacy is $13,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13500} \\]"
