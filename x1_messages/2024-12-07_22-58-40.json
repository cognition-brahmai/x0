        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from station A to station C, with a stop at station B. The train goes at a constant speed of 60 km/h, and it takes 2 hours to get from A to B. Then it stops for 30 minutes at B before continuing to C, which is twice as far as A to B. I need to find out the total time from A to C, including the break.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the distances involved. Since the train travels from A to B in 2 hours at 60 km/h, I can calculate the distance between A and B. Distance is speed multiplied by time, so:\n\nDistance from A to B = 60 km/h * 2 h = 120 km.\n\nNow, the distance from B to C is twice that, so:\n\nDistance from B to C = 2 * 120 km = 240 km.\n\nNext, I need to find out how long it takes to travel from B to C at the same speed of 60 km/h. Time is distance divided by speed, so:\n\nTime from B to C = 240 km / 60 km/h = 4 hours.\n\nNow, adding up all the parts:\n\n- Time from A to B: 2 hours\n\n- Break at B: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)\n\n- Time from B to C: 4 hours\n\nTotal time = 2 + 0.5 + 4 = 6.5 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the train to travel from station A to station C, including the break, is 6.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
