The Alps are indeed a major mountain range that stretches across eight countries in Europe, including France and Italy, and they are known for being the highest in Europe. Mont Blanc, which is part of the Alps, is the highest peak in Europe, standing at about 4,808 meters (15,774 feet). So, yes, the Alps are the mountain range you're thinking of."
