        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: a farmer has chickens and cows on his farm. He counts a total of 40 heads and 116 legs. I need to figure out how many chickens and cows there are.\n\nFirst, I know that both chickens and cows have heads, and they have legs, but different numbers of legs. Chickens have 1 head and 2 legs, while cows have 1 head and 4 legs.\n\nSo, if there are chickens and cows, and together they have 40 heads, that means the total number of animals is 40, because each animal has one head.\n\nLet me denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K.\n\nSo, C + K = 40. That's my first equation.\n\nNow, for the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 116.\n\nSo, 2C + 4K = 116. That's my second equation.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables.\n\nEquation 1: C + K = 40\n\nEquation 2: 2C + 4K = 116\n\nI need to solve for C and K.\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. I can solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other equation.\n\nLet me solve Equation 1 for C:\n\nC = 40 - K\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 2:\n\n2(40 - K) + 4K = 116\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\n80 - 2K + 4K = 116\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n80 + 2K = 116\n\nNow, subtract 80 from both sides:\n\n2K = 36\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nK = 18\n\nSo, there are 18 cows.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for C:\n\nC = 40 - 18 = 22\n\nSo, there are 22 chickens and 18 cows.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nIf there are 22 chickens, each with 2 legs, that's 22 * 2 = 44 legs.\n\nAnd 18 cows, each with 4 legs, that's 18 * 4 = 72 legs.\n\nTotal legs: 44 + 72 = 116. That matches the given total.\n\nAlso, the total number of heads is 22 + 18 = 40, which matches.\n\nSo, the answer should be 22 chickens and 18 cows.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the elimination method.\n\nLet me try that to verify.\n\nI have:\n\nEquation 1: C + K = 40\n\nEquation 2: 2C + 4K = 116\n\nI can multiply Equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of C the same:\n\n2C + 2K = 80\n\nNow, subtract this from Equation 2:\n\n(2C + 4K) - (2C + 2K) = 116 - 80\n\nThat gives:\n\n2K = 36\n\nSo, K = 18\n\nThen, C = 40 - 18 = 22\n\nSame result.\n\nAnother way is to use matrices, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it logically.\n\nIf all 40 animals were chickens, that would be 40 * 2 = 80 legs.\n\nBut there are 116 legs, which is 116 - 80 = 36 legs short.\n\nEach cow has 2 more legs than a chicken.\n\nSo, number of cows is 36 / 2 = 18 cows.\n\nThen, chickens are 40 - 18 = 22 chickens.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22 \\text{ chickens and } 18 \\text{ cows}} \\]\n"
