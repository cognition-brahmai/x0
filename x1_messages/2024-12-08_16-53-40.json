        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a logistics company wanting to replace their old delivery trucks with newer, more fuel-efficient ones. They have 500 trucks right now, each averaging 15 miles per gallon (mpg). The new trucks can do 25 mpg. Each truck drives 100,000 miles a year, and fuel costs $3 per gallon. I need to figure out how much they can save annually on fuel if they replace all their trucks.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. They want to know the potential annual fuel savings from switching to more efficient trucks. So, I guess I need to calculate how much fuel they currently use, how much they would use with the new trucks, and then find the difference. That difference, multiplied by the cost per gallon, will give me the savings.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the current annual fuel consumption.\n\nThey have 500 trucks, each traveling 100,000 miles per year. Their current average fuel efficiency is 15 mpg.\n\nSo, for one truck:\n\nFuel used per year = total miles driven per year / fuel efficiency\n\n= 100,000 miles / 15 mpg\n\n= 6,666.67 gallons per year.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, yes, because 15 miles per gallon means for every gallon, the truck can go 15 miles. So, to go 100,000 miles, you'd need 100,000 divided by 15, which is indeed approximately 6,666.67 gallons per year.\n\nOkay, now for 500 trucks:\n\nTotal current fuel consumption = 500 * 6,666.67 gallons\n\n= 3,333,335 gallons per year.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of fuel.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the annual fuel consumption with the new trucks.\n\nThe new trucks have a fuel efficiency of 25 mpg. So, for one truck:\n\nFuel used per year = 100,000 miles / 25 mpg\n\n= 4,000 gallons per year.\n\nThat's a significant improvement from 6,666.67 gallons.\n\nFor 500 trucks:\n\nTotal new fuel consumption = 500 * 4,000 gallons\n\n= 2,000,000 gallons per year.\n\nStep 3: Find the difference in fuel consumption.\n\nFuel saved per year = current fuel consumption - new fuel consumption\n\n= 3,333,335 gallons - 2,000,000 gallons\n\n= 1,333,335 gallons per year.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the cost savings.\n\nFuel costs $3 per gallon.\n\nSo, total savings = fuel saved per year * cost per gallon\n\n= 1,333,335 gallons * $3/gallon\n\n= $4,000,005 per year.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like an unusually exact number. Let me check my calculations.\n\nActually, in step 1, 100,000 miles / 15 mpg = 6,666.666... gallons, which I rounded to 6,666.67. Similarly, in step 2, 100,000 miles / 25 mpg = 4,000 gallons exactly.\n\nThen, total current consumption: 500 * 6,666.666... = 3,333,333.333... gallons.\n\nTotal new consumption: 500 * 4,000 = 2,000,000 gallons.\n\nFuel saved: 3,333,333.333... - 2,000,000 = 1,333,333.333... gallons.\n\nCost savings: 1,333,333.333... * $3 = $4,000,000.\n\nSo, it's exactly $4,000,000 per year.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step, I had $4,000,005 due to rounding errors. It's better to keep more decimal places or use fractions to avoid such discrepancies.\n\nLet me do it more accurately.\n\nLet\u2019s use fractions for exact calculations.\n\nCurrent fuel consumption per truck:\n\n100,000 miles / 15 mpg = 100,000 / 15 = 6,666.666... gallons, which is 6,666 and 2/3 gallons.\n\nSimilarly, for 500 trucks:\n\n500 * 6,666.666... = 500 * (20,000 / 3) = 10,000,000 / 3 gallons.\n\nNew fuel consumption per truck:\n\n100,000 miles / 25 mpg = 4,000 gallons.\n\nFor 500 trucks:\n\n500 * 4,000 = 2,000,000 gallons.\n\nFuel saved:\n\n10,000,000 / 3 - 2,000,000 = (10,000,000 - 6,000,000) / 3 = 4,000,000 / 3 gallons.\n\nCost savings:\n\n(4,000,000 / 3) * 3 = 4,000,000 dollars per year.\n\nYes, that's better. So, the exact savings would be $4,000,000 per year.\n\nNow, it's important to consider if there are any other costs involved in this replacement, such as the cost of buying new trucks, maintenance, etc. But based on the information provided, the potential annual fuel savings would be $4,000,000.\n\nAlso, assuming that the new trucks don't have any additional operational costs that would offset these savings. But according to the question, we're only to consider the fuel savings.\n\nSo, the company could save $4,000,000 per year on fuel by replacing all their trucks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000000} \\]"
