The expression is:\n\n((8 - 4)^2 + (12 / 3) * 2) - 5 * 3 + 7\n\nFirst, I'll handle the operations inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with (8 - 4), that's 4.\n\nSo, (4)^2 is 16.\n\nNext, (12 / 3) is 4, and then multiplied by 2 is 8.\n\nSo now, the expression inside the first set of parentheses becomes 16 + 8, which is 24.\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n24 - 5 * 3 + 7\n\nNext, I need to handle multiplication before addition and subtraction.\n\n5 * 3 is 15.\n\nSo now, it's:\n\n24 - 15 + 7\n\nNow, performing the subtraction and addition from left to right:\n\n24 - 15 is 9, plus 7 is 16.\n\nSo, the final answer is 16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
