        "content": "In political science, the term for a system of government where power is divided between a central government and individual states is called a \"federal system.\" So, the correct answer is D. Federal system.\n\nIn a federal system, both the central government and the states have their own powers and responsibilities, and they work together to govern the country. This is different from a unitary system, where all power is concentrated in the central government, and from other forms of government like oligarchy or autocracy, which refer to the concentration of power in the hands of a few or one person, respectively.\n\nSo, to summarize, the key feature of a federal system is the division of power between national and state governments."
