        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 40 students. According to the problem, 60% passed the math exam, and 75% passed the English exam. Also, every student passed at least one of the exams. We need to find out how many students passed both exams.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students passed the math exam. Since 60% of 40 students passed math, we can calculate that as follows:\n\nNumber of students who passed math = 60% of 40 = (60/100) * 40 = 24 students.\n\nNext, for the English exam, 75% of the students passed. So, let's calculate that:\n\nNumber of students who passed English = 75% of 40 = (75/100) * 40 = 30 students.\n\nNow, if we add the number of students who passed math and the number who passed English, we get:\n\n24 (math) + 30 (English) = 54.\n\nBut wait, there are only 40 students in the class. How can the total number of passes be 54 if there are only 40 students? The answer is that some students passed both exams, so they are being counted twice in this total.\n\nTo find out how many students passed both exams, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the total number of students who passed at least one exam is:\n\nTotal = Number who passed math + Number who passed English - Number who passed both.\n\nWe know that every student passed at least one exam, so the total is 40 students. Plugging in the numbers we have:\n\n40 = 24 + 30 - Number who passed both.\n\nNow, let's solve for the number who passed both:\n\nNumber who passed both = 24 + 30 - 40 = 54 - 40 = 14.\n\nSo, 14 students passed both exams.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If 14 students passed both, then the number who passed only math would be 24 - 14 = 10, and the number who passed only English would be 30 - 14 = 16. Adding those up: 10 (only math) + 16 (only English) + 14 (both) = 40, which matches the total number of students. Looks correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the concept of sets. Let\u2019s denote the set of students who passed math as M and those who passed English as E. The total number of students is the union of M and E, which is M \u222a E. According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|M \u222a E| = |M| + |E| - |M \u2229 E|.\n\nWe know that |M \u222a E| = 40, |M| = 24, and |E| = 30. So plugging these values into the formula:\n\n40 = 24 + 30 - |M \u2229 E|.\n\nSolving for |M \u2229 E| gives us:\n\n|M \u2229 E| = 24 + 30 - 40 = 14.\n\nSo again, 14 students passed both exams.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The problem states that every student passed at least one of the exams, which means there are no students who failed both exams. That aligns with our use of the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to use probabilities or percentages, we could think about the percentage of students who passed both exams. But since we're dealing with a specific number of students, the approach we've taken is appropriate.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The answer should be 14 students passed both exams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
