        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 100 widgets per hour, and it works for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. We need to find out how many widgets it produces in a month, assuming there are 4 weeks in that month.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the daily production. Since it produces 100 widgets per hour for 8 hours, the daily production should be:\n\n100 widgets/hour * 8 hours/day = 800 widgets/day\n\nNext, to find the weekly production, I'll multiply the daily production by the number of days it operates per week:\n\n800 widgets/day * 6 days/week = 4800 widgets/week\n\nNow, for the monthly production, I'll multiply the weekly production by the number of weeks in a month:\n\n4800 widgets/week * 4 weeks/month = 19,200 widgets/month\n\nSo, the factory produces 19,200 widgets in a month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's consider the total number of hours the factory operates in a month and then multiply by the production rate.\n\nFirst, find the total hours per day: 8 hours/day\n\nThen, total hours per week: 8 hours/day * 6 days/week = 48 hours/week\n\nThen, total hours per month: 48 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 192 hours/month\n\nNow, multiply the total hours per month by the production rate:\n\n100 widgets/hour * 192 hours/month = 19,200 widgets/month\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the factory produces 19,200 widgets in a month.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. For example, are there any holidays or downtime that might reduce the number of operating days? The problem says the factory operates 6 days a week, and assumes 4 weeks in a month, so I think it's safe to go with the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the month has more or less than 4 weeks. But the problem specifies to assume 4 weeks in a month, so I'll stick with that.\n\nSo, the final answer is 19,200 widgets per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19200} \\]\n"
