        "content": "\"The Yellow Wallpaper\" is a famous short story written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. It was influenced by her own experiences with mental health, particularly her struggles with postpartum depression and the rest cure prescribed by her physician. The story is a chilling portrayal of a woman's descent into madness as she becomes increasingly obsessed with the yellow wallpaper in her room. It is often regarded as an important work in feminist literature and has been widely studied and analyzed for its exploration of gender roles, mental health, and the treatment of women in the late 19th century."
