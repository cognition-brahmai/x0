The French phrase you're thinking of is \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" which literally translates to \"already seen.\" It's a common expression used to describe the sensation that a new situation has been experienced before. So, when someone says they have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, they mean they feel like they've already been through whatever is happening at that moment."
