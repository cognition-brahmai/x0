        "content": "So the train is traveling at two different speeds for different durations. First, it goes at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then it speeds up to 80 miles per hour for another 3 hours. I need to find out the total distance it travels.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part, it's 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, and for the second part, it's 80 miles per hour times 3 hours. Then, I just add those two distances together to get the total distance.\n\nLet me do the math for the first part: 60 miles per hour times 2 hours is 120 miles.\n\nNow, for the second part: 80 miles per hour times 3 hours is 240 miles.\n\nAdding those together: 120 miles plus 240 miles equals 360 miles.\n\nSo, the total distance the train travels is 360 miles.\n\nBut just to make sure, I'll double-check my calculations. 60 times 2 is indeed 120, and 80 times 3 is 240. Adding them up gives 360. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
