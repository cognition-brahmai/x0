        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the volume of a cylindrical water tank in gallons, given its diameter and height, and the conversion factor from cubic feet to gallons.\n\nFirst, I know that the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the base, and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the diameter is 6 feet, the radius \\( r \\) would be half of that, so:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{6 \\text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThe height \\( h \\) is given as 10 feet.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (3 \\text{ feet})^2 (10 \\text{ feet}) \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi (9 \\text{ feet}^2) (10 \\text{ feet}) \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi (90 \\text{ feet}^3) \\]\n\\[ V \\approx 3.14159 \\times 90 \\text{ feet}^3 \\]\n\\[ V \\approx 282.7431 \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, I need to convert this volume from cubic feet to gallons. The conversion factor given is 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons.\n\nSo, to find the volume in gallons:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{gallons}} = 282.7431 \\text{ cubic feet} \\times 7.48 \\text{ gallons/cubic foot} \\]\n\\[ V_{\\text{gallons}} \\approx 2112.119 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the volume is approximately 2112 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2112 \\text{ gallons}} \\]"
