        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that simulates a bank account with deposit and withdrawal functionalities. It should also store transactions in a local SQLite database and support multiple accounts identified by unique account numbers. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a Java project. I'll use IntelliJ IDEA for this, but any IDE or even a text editor will do. I need to make sure I have the JDK installed.\n\nNext, since I need to interact with an SQLite database, I have to include the SQLite JDBC driver in my project. I can download the JAR file from the official SQLite website or include it via Maven or Gradle if I'm using a build tool. For simplicity, I'll download the JAR and add it to my project's library.\n\nNow, let's think about the database schema. I need to store multiple bank accounts and their transactions. So, probably, I'll have two tables: one for accounts and another for transactions.\n\nThe accounts table can have fields like account_number (primary key), account_holder_name, and balance.\n\nThe transactions table can have fields like transaction_id (primary key), account_number (foreign key referencing accounts), transaction_type (deposit or withdrawal), amount, and transaction_date.\n\nI need to make sure that the account_number is unique and that transactions are linked to the correct account.\n\nLet me sketch a quick ER diagram in my mind:\n\n- Accounts Table\n\n  - account_number (PK)\n\n  - account_holder_name\n\n  - balance\n\n- Transactions Table\n\n  - transaction_id (PK)\n\n  - account_number (FK)\n\n  - transaction_type\n\n  - amount\n\n  - transaction_date\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the Java program, I need to provide functionalities to:\n\n1. Create a new account.\n\n2. Deposit money into an account.\n\n3. Withdraw money from an account.\n\n4. Probably view account details and transaction history.\n\nI should think about the classes I'll need. Maybe a BankAccount class that holds account details and methods for deposit and withdrawal. A Transaction class might also be useful.\n\nAlso, I need a DatabaseHandler class or something similar that handles connecting to the SQLite database, creating tables, and executing SQL queries for CRUD operations.\n\nLet me think about the flow of the program:\n\n- When the program starts, it should check if the database exists. If not, it should create the necessary tables.\n\n- Then, it can present a menu to the user:\n\n  - Create a new account\n\n  - Deposit money\n\n  - Withdraw money\n\n  - Check account balance\n\n  - View transaction history\n\n  - Exit\n\n- Depending on the user's choice, it should call the corresponding methods.\n\nFor creating a new account, I need to generate a unique account number. Maybe I can use a combination of current time millis and some random digits to ensure uniqueness.\n\nWait, but it's better to let the database handle the primary key generation. So, maybe account_number can be an auto-increment field.\n\nActually, in SQLite, I can define account_number as INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, which will automatically handle incrementing.\n\nBut in reality, account numbers are usually not sequential. Maybe I should generate a random number and check if it already exists in the database.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll let SQLite handle the auto-increment for account_number.\n\nWait, but in the accounts table, if I define account_number as INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, it will auto-increment, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach for account numbers.\n\nIn real banks, account numbers are usually fixed length and might have some meaning or are randomly generated but unique.\n\nMaybe I can generate a random 10-digit number and check if it already exists in the database before assigning it to a new account.\n\nThat might be a better approach.\n\nOkay, so for creating a new account:\n\n- Generate a random 10-digit number.\n\n- Check if it already exists in the accounts table.\n\n- If not, insert a new row with this account_number, account_holder_name, and initial balance (probably zero).\n\nFor deposit and withdrawal:\n\n- Find the account by account_number.\n\n- If it exists, update the balance accordingly.\n\n- Insert a new transaction into the transactions table.\n\nI also need to handle cases where the account doesn't exist or if there are insufficient funds for withdrawal.\n\nI should think about error handling and validation.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Ensure that account_number exists before performing deposit or withdrawal.\n\n- Ensure that withdrawal amount doesn't exceed the current balance.\n\n- Validate that deposit and withdrawal amounts are positive numbers.\n\nAlso, for transaction dates, I can use the current date and time when the transaction is made.\n\nNow, let's think about the DatabaseHandler class.\n\nIt should handle:\n\n- Connecting to the SQLite database.\n\n- Creating tables if they don't exist.\n\n- Inserting new accounts and transactions.\n\n- Updating account balances.\n\n- Retrieving account details and transaction history.\n\nI need to make sure that the database connection is properly managed, preferably using try-with-resources to ensure that resources are closed after use.\n\nLet me draft some SQL statements:\n\nCreate Accounts table:\n\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n\n    account_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    account_holder_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    balance REAL NOT NULL\n\n);\n\nWait, but if account_number is INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, it will auto-increment. Maybe I should use a different data type for account_number, like TEXT, to allow for non-sequential numbers.\n\nActually, in SQLite, INTEGER PRIMARY KEY is used for auto-incrementing rowids. If I want to use custom account numbers, I should define account_number as TEXT UNIQUE.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n\n    account_number TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    account_holder_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    balance REAL NOT NULL\n\n);\n\nAnd for transactions:\n\nCREATE TABLE transactions (\n\n    transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n    account_number TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    amount REAL NOT NULL,\n\n    transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n\n    FOREIGN KEY (account_number) REFERENCES accounts(account_number)\n\n);\n\nYes, that seems better.\n\nNow, for generating account numbers, I can generate a random alphanumeric string of a fixed length and check if it already exists in the accounts table.\n\nAlternatively, I can use UUIDs, but they are longer. Maybe for simplicity, I'll generate a random 10-digit number and convert it to a string.\n\nBut considering that SQLite's INTEGER might not suffice for very large numbers, using TEXT for account_number is safer.\n\nNow, moving on to the Java classes.\n\nFirst, the DatabaseHandler class.\n\nIt should have methods like:\n\n- createTables(): to create accounts and transactions tables if they don't exist.\n\n- createAccount(String accountHolderName): generates an account_number, inserts into accounts table.\n\n- deposit(String accountNumber, double amount): updates balance and inserts transaction.\n\n- withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount): checks balance, updates balance, inserts transaction.\n\n- getAccountDetails(String accountNumber): retrieves and returns account details.\n\n- getTransactionHistory(String accountNumber): retrieves and returns list of transactions.\n\nI need to handle database connections properly. Maybe use a singleton pattern for the DatabaseHandler to ensure only one instance handles the database operations.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll just have a class with static methods for database operations.\n\nWait, but static methods might not be the best approach for database handling. It's better to create an instance of DatabaseHandler and manage the connection accordingly.\n\nOkay, I'll go with an instance-based approach.\n\nNow, for generating random account numbers.\n\nI can create a method that generates a random 10-digit number, converts it to a string, and checks if it already exists in the accounts table.\n\nIf it does, generate another one, and so on, until I get a unique account_number.\n\nBut this might not be efficient if the loop runs many times. Maybe instead of generating a random number, I can use a combination of current timestamp and a random suffix.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a simulation, I can accept that account numbers might not be perfectly unique in reality, as long as the probability of collision is very low.\n\nBut for the sake of the exercise, I should ensure uniqueness.\n\nMaybe I can generate a UUID and take the first 10 characters or something like that.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll generate a random 10-digit number and check for uniqueness.\n\nNow, for the user interface.\n\nI need to have a menu-driven program that interacts with the user via the console.\n\nI can use Scanner class to read user inputs.\n\nLet me sketch the main method:\n\n- Instantiate DatabaseHandler.\n\n- Display a menu:\n\n  1. Create a new account\n\n  2. Deposit money\n\n  3. Withdraw money\n\n  4. Check account balance\n\n  5. View transaction history\n\n  6. Exit\n\n- Based on the choice, prompt for necessary inputs and call corresponding methods.\n\nFor example, if the user chooses to create a new account:\n\n- Ask for account holder's name.\n\n- Generate a unique account_number.\n\n- Insert into accounts table with zero balance.\n\n- Inform the user of the assigned account_number.\n\nSimilarly, for deposit and withdrawal, ask for account_number and amount, then perform the operations.\n\nI should also format the output nicely, maybe showing the updated balance after deposit or withdrawal.\n\nFor viewing transaction history, retrieve and display all transactions for the given account_number, ordered by transaction_date.\n\nI need to handle exceptions and errors gracefully, like invalid account_number, insufficient balance, invalid amounts, etc.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent accounts and transactions in Java.\n\nMaybe create classes for Account and Transaction.\n\nAccount class:\n\n- accountNumber (String)\n\n- accountHolderName (String)\n\n- balance (double)\n\nTransaction class:\n\n- transactionId (int)\n\n- accountNumber (String)\n\n- transactionType (String: \"deposit\" or \"withdrawal\")\n\n- amount (double)\n\n- transactionDate (Timestamp)\n\nBut since I'm retrieving these from the database, I can create constructor(s) to initialize these objects from ResultSet.\n\nNow, for the DatabaseHandler class.\n\nIt should have methods to:\n\n- connect to the database (open connection)\n\n- create tables if they don't exist\n\n- insert a new account\n\n- update account balance\n\n- insert a new transaction\n\n- retrieve account details\n\n- retrieve transaction history\n\nI need to make sure that when depositing or withdrawing, I'm updating the balance correctly and also logging the transaction.\n\nAlso, consider concurrency, but since this is a simple simulation with a single user, I'll ignore concurrency issues for now.\n\nNow, for the account_number, since it's a String, I need to handle it as text in SQL queries.\n\nMake sure to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n\nOkay, I think I have a rough plan.\n\nLet me start by writing the SQL statements for creating tables.\n\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n\n    account_number TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n\n    account_holder_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    balance REAL NOT NULL\n\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE transactions (\n\n    transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n    account_number TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    amount REAL NOT NULL,\n\n    transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n\n    FOREIGN KEY (account_number) REFERENCES accounts(account_number)\n\n);\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, for generating account numbers.\n\nI'll create a method that generates a random 10-digit number, converts it to a string, and checks if it exists in the accounts table.\n\nIf it does, generate another one, else use it as the account_number.\n\nTo generate a random number, I can use Random class or UUID.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll generate a random long and convert it to a string.\n\nBut long might be too short for 10 digits, so maybe use Random class to generate a 10-digit number.\n\nWait, actually, Random class can generate integers, but for a 10-digit number, I can generate a long.\n\nHere's a rough idea:\n\npublic String generateAccountNumber() {\n\n    Random random = new Random();\n\n    long accountNumber = 1000000000 + random.nextLong(9000000000L); // generates a 10-digit number\n\n    String accountNumberStr = String.valueOf(accountNumber);\n\n    // check if exists in database\n\n    if (isAccountNumberExists(accountNumberStr)) {\n\n        return generateAccountNumber(); // recursive call\n\n    } else {\n\n        return accountNumberStr;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut nextLong might generate negative numbers, so I need to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, use nextInt and scale it appropriately.\n\nWait, better yet, use DecimalFormat to format a random long into a 10-digit string.\n\nSomething like:\n\npublic String generateAccountNumber() {\n\n    Random random = new Random();\n\n    long accountNumber = random.nextLong();\n\n    DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(\"0000000000\");\n\n    String accountNumberStr = df.format(accountNumber);\n\n    // check if exists in database\n\n    if (isAccountNumberExists(accountNumberStr)) {\n\n        return generateAccountNumber(); // recursive call\n\n    } else {\n\n        return accountNumberStr;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut DecimalFormat might not handle negative numbers well. Maybe use abs(value).\n\nWait, better approach:\n\npublic String generateAccountNumber() {\n\n    Random random = new Random();\n\n    long accountNumber = Math.abs(random.nextLong());\n\n    DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(\"0000000000\");\n\n    String accountNumberStr = df.format(accountNumber);\n\n    // check if exists in database\n\n    if (isAccountNumberExists(accountNumberStr)) {\n\n        return generateAccountNumber(); // recursive call\n\n    } else {\n\n        return accountNumberStr;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis should generate a 10-digit string and ensure it's positive.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the generated number is exactly 10 digits, without leading zeros.\n\nWait, DecimalFormat(\"0000000000\") will pad with leading zeros if the number is less than 10 digits.\n\nThat might not be desirable for account numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps I should generate a random number between 1000000000 and 9999999999.\n\nWhich are the ranges for 10-digit numbers.\n\nIn Java, Random.nextLong() can generate numbers up to 9223372036854775807, which is way beyond 10 digits.\n\nSo, I can generate a long between 1000000000 and 9999999999.\n\nHere's how:\n\npublic String generateAccountNumber() {\n\n    Random random = new Random();\n\n    long min = 1000000000L;\n\n    long max = 9999999999L;\n\n    long accountNumber = min + (long) (random.nextDouble() * (max - min));\n\n    String accountNumberStr = String.valueOf(accountNumber);\n\n    // check if exists in database\n\n    if (isAccountNumberExists(accountNumberStr)) {\n\n        return generateAccountNumber(); // recursive call\n\n    } else {\n\n        return accountNumberStr;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis should generate a 10-digit number without leading zeros.\n\nBut using nextDouble might not be the most efficient way. Maybe use nextLong bounded between min and max.\n\nWait, Java's Random class has nextLong between 0 and the bound.\n\nActually, it's a bit tricky to get a uniform distribution with nextLong in a specific range.\n\nI can use nextLong() % range, but that might not be uniform.\n\nBetter to use nextLong(bound).\n\nWait, in Java 12, there's Random.nextLong(long bound), but in earlier versions, I need to handle it differently.\n\nAssuming I'm using Java 8, I'll do it this way:\n\npublic String generateAccountNumber() {\n\n    Random random = new Random();\n\n    long min = 1000000000L;\n\n    long max = 9999999999L;\n\n    long accountNumber = random.nextLong((max - min) + 1) + min;\n\n    String accountNumberStr = String.valueOf(accountNumber);\n\n    // check if exists in database\n\n    if (isAccountNumberExists(accountNumberStr)) {\n\n        return generateAccountNumber(); // recursive call\n\n    } else {\n\n        return accountNumberStr;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut actually, Random.nextLong() returns a long between Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nTo get a long between min and max, I can use:\n\nlong accountNumber = random.nextLong() % (max - min + 1) + min;\n\nBut this might not be uniformly distributed.\n\nA better way is to use:\n\nlong accountNumber = min + (long) (random.nextDouble() * (max - min + 1));\n\nBut this involves casting double to long, which might not be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Apache Commons Lang's RandomUtils class, but since I want to keep dependencies minimal, I'll stick with Java's Random.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the above method, acknowledging that it might not be perfectly uniform.\n\nNow, for checking if the account_number exists, I need a method in DatabaseHandler like:\n\nprivate boolean isAccountNumberExists(String accountNumber) {\n\n    String query = \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts WHERE account_number = ?\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query)) {\n\n        pstmt.setString(1, accountNumber);\n\n        try (ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery()) {\n\n            if (rs.next()) {\n\n                int count = rs.getInt(1);\n\n                return count > 0;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n    return false;\n\n}\n\nOkay, that should work.\n\nNow, for creating a new account:\n\npublic void createAccount(String accountHolderName) {\n\n    String accountNumber = generateAccountNumber();\n\n    String insertQuery = \"INSERT INTO accounts (account_number, account_holder_name, balance) VALUES (?, ?, 0.0)\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertQuery)) {\n\n        pstmt.setString(1, accountNumber);\n\n        pstmt.setString(2, accountHolderName);\n\n        pstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Account created successfully. Account number: \" + accountNumber);\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, for deposit:\n\npublic void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n\n    if (amount <= 0) {\n\n        System.out.println(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    String updateQuery = \"UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE account_number = ?\";\n\n    String insertTransactionQuery = \"INSERT INTO transactions (account_number, transaction_type, amount) VALUES (?, 'deposit', ?)\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement updatePstmt = conn.prepareStatement(updateQuery);\n\n         PreparedStatement insertPstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertTransactionQuery)) {\n\n        updatePstmt.setDouble(1, amount);\n\n        updatePstmt.setString(2, accountNumber);\n\n        int rowsUpdated = updatePstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n        if (rowsUpdated > 0) {\n\n            insertPstmt.setString(1, accountNumber);\n\n            insertPstmt.setDouble(2, amount);\n\n            insertPstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n            System.out.println(\"Deposit successful. New balance: \" + getAccountBalance(accountNumber));\n\n        } else {\n\n            System.out.println(\"Account not found.\");\n\n        }\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, for withdrawal:\n\npublic void withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n\n    if (amount <= 0) {\n\n        System.out.println(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    double currentBalance = getAccountBalance(accountNumber);\n\n    if (currentBalance < amount) {\n\n        System.out.println(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    String updateQuery = \"UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE account_number = ?\";\n\n    String insertTransactionQuery = \"INSERT INTO transactions (account_number, transaction_type, amount) VALUES (?, 'withdrawal', ?)\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement updatePstmt = conn.prepareStatement(updateQuery);\n\n         PreparedStatement insertPstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertTransactionQuery)) {\n\n        updatePstmt.setDouble(1, amount);\n\n        updatePstmt.setString(2, accountNumber);\n\n        int rowsUpdated = updatePstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n        if (rowsUpdated > 0) {\n\n            insertPstmt.setString(1, accountNumber);\n\n            insertPstmt.setDouble(2, amount);\n\n            insertPstmt.executeUpdate();\n\n            System.out.println(\"Withdrawal successful.

ORDER BY transaction_date\";\n\n    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query)) {\n\n        pstmt.setString(1, accountNumber);\n\n        try (ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery()) {\n\n            while (rs.next()) {\n\n                int transactionId = rs.getInt(\"transaction_id\");\n\n                String type = rs.getString(\"transaction_type\");\n\n                double amount = rs.getDouble(\"amount\");\n\n                Timestamp date = rs.getTimestamp(\"transaction_date\");\n\n                Transaction transaction = new Transaction(transactionId, accountNumber, type, amount, date);\n\n                transactions.add(transaction);\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n    return transactions;\n\n}\n\nNow, I need to think about how to structure the classes.\n\nProbably have:\n\n- DatabaseHandler class: handles all database operations.\n\n- Account class: represents an account with account_number, holder_name, and balance.\n\n- Transaction class: represents a transaction with transaction_id, account_number, type, amount, and date.\n\n- Main class: contains the main method, handles user interactions, and uses DatabaseHandler to perform operations.\n\nI should also ensure that the database is initialized when the program starts, creating tables if they don't exist.\n\nIn the DatabaseHandler class, I can have a method like initializeDatabase() that checks if the tables exist and creates them if necessary.\n\nTo check if a table exists, I can query the sqlite_master table.\n\nHere's an example method:\n\npublic void initializeDatabase() {\n\n    String createAccountsTable = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS accounts (\" +\n\n            \"account_number TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\" +\n\n            \"account_holder_name TEXT NOT NULL,\" +\n\n            \"balance REAL NOT NULL\" +\n\n            \")\";\n\n    String createTransactionsTable = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (\" +\n\n            \"transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" +\n\n            \"account_number TEXT NOT NULL,\" +\n\n            \"transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,\" +\n\n            \"amount REAL NOT NULL,\" +\n\n            \"transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\" +\n\n            \"FOREIGN KEY (account_number) REFERENCES accounts(account_number)\" +\n\n            \")\";\n\n    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n\n        stmt.execute(createAccountsTable);\n\n        stmt.execute(createTransactionsTable);\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis way, the tables will be created automatically if they don't exist.\n\nNow, for the user interface.\n\nIn the main method, I can use a loop that displays the menu and reads user choices until the user chooses to exit.\n\nI'll use the Scanner class to read inputs from the console.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    DatabaseHandler dbHandler = new DatabaseHandler();\n\n    dbHandler.initializeDatabase();\n\n    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n    boolean exit = false;\n\n    while (!exit) {\n\n        System.out.println(\"\\nBank Account Simulator\");\n\n        System.out.println(\"1. Create a new account\");\n\n        System.out.println(\"2. Deposit money\");\n\n        System.out.println(\"3. Withdraw money\");\n\n        System.out.println(\"4. Check account balance\");\n\n        System.out.println(\"5. View transaction history\");\n\n        System.out.println(\"6. Exit\");\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter your choice: \");\n\n        int choice = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        scanner.nextLine(); // consume newline\n\n        switch (choice) {\n\n            case 1:\n\n                System.out.print(\"Enter account holder's name: \");\n\n                String holderName = scanner.nextLine();\n\n                dbHandler.createAccount(holderName);\n\n                break;\n\n            case 2:\n\n                System.out.print(\"Enter account number: \");\n\n                String depositAccountNumber = scanner.nextLine();\n\n                System.out.print(\"Enter deposit amount: \");\n\n                double depositAmount = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n                scanner.nextLine(); // consume newline\n\n                dbHandler.deposit(depositAccountNumber, depositAmount);\n\n                break;\n\n            case 3:\n\n                System.out.print(\"Enter account number: \");\n\n                String withdrawalAccountNumber = scanner.nextLine();\n\n                System.out.print(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \");\n\n                double withdrawalAmount = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n                scanner.nextLine(); // consume newline\n\n                dbHandler.withdraw(withdrawalAccountNumber, withdrawalAmount);\n\n                break;\n\n            case 4:\n\n                System.out.print(\"Enter account number: \");\n\n                String balanceAccountNumber = scanner.nextLine();\n\n                double balance = dbHandler.getAccountBalance(balanceAccountNumber);\n\n                if (balance != -1) {\n\n                    System.out.println(\"Account balance: \" + balance);\n\n                } else {\n\n                    System.out.println(\"Account not found.\");\n\n                }\n\n                break;\n\n            case 5:\n\n                System.out.print(\"Enter account number: \");\n\n                String historyAccountNumber = scanner.nextLine();\n\n                List<Transaction> transactions = dbHandler.getTransactionHistory(historyAccountNumber);\n\n                if (!transactions.isEmpty()) {\n\n                    System.out.println(\"Transaction history:\");\n\n                    for (Transaction transaction : transactions) {\n\n                        System.out.println(transaction);\n\n                    }\n\n                } else {\n\n                    System.out.println(\"No transactions found or account not found.\");\n\n                }\n\n                break;\n\n            case 6:\n\n                exit = true;\n\n                break;\n\n            default:\n\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    scanner.close();\n\n}\n\nI need to make sure that when reading doubles, I handle cases where the user enters invalid numbers.\n\nAlso, I should handle exceptions when parsing user inputs.\n\nFor example, if the user enters a non-numeric value for account number or amount, it will throw an exception.\n\nTo handle this, I can use try-catch blocks around the parsing operations.\n\nAdditionally, for the account_number, since it's a String, but I'm generating it as a 10-digit number, I need to ensure that users enter exactly 10-digit strings for account numbers.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll accept any string as an account_number.\n\nNow, for the Account and Transaction classes, I need to define them with appropriate fields and constructors.\n\nHere's a rough outline:\n\npublic class Account {\n\n    private String accountNumber;\n\n    private String accountHolderName;\n\n    private double balance;\n\n    // constructor, getters, toString()\n\n}\n\npublic class Transaction {\n\n    private int transactionId;\n\n    private String accountNumber;\n\n    private String transactionType;\n\n    private double amount;\n\n    private Timestamp transactionDate;\n\n    // constructor, getters, toString()\n\n}\n\nI need to implement the constructors and toString methods appropriately.\n\nFor example, Transaction's toString could display the transaction details in a readable format.\n\nNow, regarding the database connection.\n\nIn the DatabaseHandler class, I need to manage the database connection.\n\nI can have a constructor that establishes the connection to the SQLite database.\n\nSomething like:\n\npublic class DatabaseHandler {\n\n    private Connection conn;\n\n    public DatabaseHandler() {\n\n        try {\n\n            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:sqlite:bank.db\");\n\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n            e.printStackTrace();\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // other methods...\n\n}\n\nAnd make sure to close the connection when the program exits, although in this simple simulation, it might not be necessary since the connection will be closed when the program terminates.\n\nBut for better practice, I can add a method to close the connection.\n\npublic void closeConnection() {\n\n    try {\n\n        if (conn != null) {\n\n            conn.close();\n\n        }\n\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n\n        e.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAnd call it in the main method before exiting.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Set up the Java project with SQLite JDBC driver.\n\n2. Create the DatabaseHandler class with methods to handle database operations.\n\n3. Create Account and Transaction classes.\n\n4. Implement the main method with a menu-driven interface.\n\n5. Handle user inputs and perform corresponding operations.\n\n6. Ensure that account numbers are unique and handle exceptions gracefully.\n\nI should also think about formatting the output, like displaying dates in a readable format.\n\nIn the Transaction class, when printing the transaction date, I can format the Timestamp to a string.\n\nFor example, in Transaction's toString method:\n\n@Override\n\npublic String toString() {\n\n    SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\n\n    return \"Transaction ID: \" + transactionId +\n\n           \", Account: \" + accountNumber +\n\n           \", Type: \" + transactionType +\n\n           \", Amount: \" + amount +\n\n           \", Date: \" + dateFormat.format(transactionDate);\n\n}\n\nThis will make the transaction history more readable.\n\nAlso, for the account balance, I can format it to two decimal places.\n\nSimilarly, for deposit and withdrawal amounts.\n\nI can use DecimalFormat for this.\n\nFor example, in the deposit method:\n\nString formattedBalance = String.format(\"%.2f\", getAccountBalance(accountNumber));\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Deposit successful. New balance: \" + formattedBalance);\n\nThis will display the balance with two decimal places.\n\nI should apply similar formatting wherever necessary.\n\nNow, considering edge cases:\n\n- Creating an account with an existing account_number: but since we're generating unique account_numbers, this shouldn't happen.\n\n- Depositing or withdrawing negative amounts: already handled by checking if amount <= 0.\n\n- Withdrawing more than the balance: handled by checking current balance before withdrawing.\n\n- Entering invalid account_numbers: handled by checking if the account exists before performing operations.\n\n- Entering non-numeric values for amounts: need to handle NumberFormatException when parsing doubles.\n\nTo handle parsing exceptions, I can surround the parsing code with try-catch blocks.\n\nFor example, when reading deposit amount:\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter deposit amount: \");\n\ntry {\n\n    double depositAmount = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n    scanner.nextLine(); // consume newline\n\n    dbHandler.deposit(depositAccountNumber, depositAmount);\n\n} catch (InputMismatchException e) {\n\n    System.out.println(\"Invalid amount. Please enter a numeric value.\");\n\n    scanner.nextLine(); // consume invalid input\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for withdrawal amount.\n\nThis will prevent the program from crashing if the user enters non-numeric values.\n\nNow, for the database operations, I need to ensure that the database file is created in the current working directory or specify the path explicitly.\n\nIn the DatabaseHandler constructor, \"jdbc:sqlite:bank.db\" will create a file named \"bank.db\" in the current directory.\n\nI should make sure that the program has write permissions in the directory where it's run.\n\nAlso, I need to handle cases where the database or tables don't exist, but since I'm creating them if they don't exist, it should be fine.\n\nNow, let's think about testing the program.\n\nI can write a simple test script or just manually test it by running the program and performing various operations:\n\n- Create multiple accounts.\n\n- Deposit money into accounts.\n\n- Withdraw money from accounts.\n\n- Check balances.\n\n- View transaction histories.\n\n- Try to withdraw more than the balance.\n\n- Enter invalid account numbers.\n\n- Enter invalid amounts.\n\n- Ensure that account numbers are unique.\n\nBy performing these operations, I can verify that the program works as expected and handles errors gracefully.\n\nAdditionally, I can query the database directly using an SQLite browser to verify that the data is being stored correctly.\n\nNow, regarding code organization.\n\nI can organize the classes in different files:\n\n- DatabaseHandler.java\n\n- Account.java\n\n- Transaction.java\n\n- Main.java (or BankSimulator.java)\n\nMake sure that all classes are in the same package or import them appropriately.\n\nAlso, ensure that the SQLite JDBC driver JAR is included in the project's build path.\n\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, I can add it by going to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries and adding the JAR file.\n\nAlternatively, if using Maven or Gradle, I can include the dependency in the build file.\n\nBut since I'm downloading the JAR manually, I'll add it to the project's libraries.\n\nNow, let's think about potential improvements or extensions.\n\n- Adding more features like transferring money between accounts.\n\n- Implementing user authentication.\n\n- Allowing multiple users to have access to their own accounts.\n\n- Improving the user interface, maybe using a GUI instead of console-based.\n\n- Implementing better error handling and logging.\n\n- Ensuring data integrity and handling concurrency issues in a multi-user environment.\n\nBut for this simulation, the current scope should suffice.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to implement the classes and methods as per the plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java program that simulates a bank account with deposit and withdrawal functionalities, storing transactions in a local SQLite database, follow the steps below.\n\n### Prerequisites\n1.
