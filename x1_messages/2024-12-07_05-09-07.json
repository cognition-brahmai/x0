        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a Java class that implements a Trie data structure. A Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure that is efficient for storing and retrieving strings. It's particularly useful for operations like auto-completion or spell-checking, where you need to find all words that start with a certain prefix.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic structure of a Trie. Each node in a Trie represents a single character of the string. The root node is empty, and each level of the tree corresponds to a position in the string. Branches represent the possible characters at that position, and a complete path from the root to a leaf node forms a valid string.\n\nSo, for example, if I insert the words \"cat\", \"car\", and \"dog\" into the Trie, the structure would look like this:\n\n- Root\n\n- c\n\n- a\n\n- t (end of \"cat\")\n\n- r (end of \"car\")\n\n- d\n\n- o\n\n- g (end of \"dog\")\n\nFrom this structure, I can see that searching for a prefix like \"ca\" would return both \"cat\" and \"car\", since both share that prefix.\n\nNow, I need to design the Trie class in Java. I'll start by defining a Node class that represents each node in the Trie. Each node will contain a map from characters to child nodes, and a boolean flag to indicate whether the node represents the end of a word.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the Node class:\n\nclass Node {\n\nMap<Character, Node> children = new HashMap<>();\n\nboolean isEndOfWord;\n\n}\n\nThen, the Trie class will have a root node, and methods for insertion, deletion, search, and retrieving all words with a given prefix.\n\nLet's think about the insertion method first. To insert a word into the Trie, I need to traverse the tree from the root, creating new nodes for each character that doesn't already exist in the path. Finally, I'll mark the node corresponding to the last character of the word as the end of a word.\n\nFor example, inserting \"cat\":\n\n- Start at root.\n\n- Check if 'c' is a child of root. If not, create a new node for 'c'.\n\n- Move to the 'c' node.\n\n- Check if 'a' is a child of 'c'. If not, create a new node for 'a'.\n\n- Move to the 'a' node.\n\n- Check if 't' is a child of 'a'. If not, create a new node for 't'.\n\n- Move to the 't' node and set isEndOfWord to true.\n\nSimilar steps would be followed for inserting \"car\" and \"dog\".\n\nNext, the search method. To search for a word, I'll traverse the Trie following the path defined by the characters in the word. If the path exists and the final node has isEndOfWord set to true, then the word is present in the Trie.\n\nFor example, searching for \"cat\":\n\n- Start at root.\n\n- Find 'c' child.\n\n- From 'c', find 'a' child.\n\n- From 'a', find 't' child.\n\n- Check if 't' node has isEndOfWord true.\n\nIf all these steps succeed, \"cat\" is in the Trie.\n\nNow, for deleting a word, it's a bit trickier because I need to remove the word while preserving other words that may share prefixes. I need to traverse to the end node of the word and set isEndOfWord to false. However, if the path to this node is shared with other words, I should not remove any nodes.\n\nFor example, if I have \"cat\" and \"car\" in the Trie, and I delete \"cat\", the \"c\" and \"a\" nodes should remain because \"car\" still uses them, but the \"t\" node's isEndOfWord should be set to false.\n\nBut, if \"cat\" is the only word using the \"t\" node, and no other words share that node, then it's safe to remove the \"t\" node altogether, provided no other words use it.\n\nThis means that deletion might require traversing back up the tree to remove any unused nodes.\n\nLastly, I need a method to return all words with a given prefix. This involves traversing the Trie to the end of the prefix, and then performing a depth-first search from that node to collect all words.\n\nFor example, given the prefix \"ca\", I would traverse to the 'a' node (after 'c'), and then collect all words from there, which would be \"cat\" and \"car\".\n\nI should also handle edge cases, such as:\n\n- Inserting multiple occurrences of the same word.\n\n- Deleting a word that doesn't exist.\n\n- Searching for a word that doesn't exist.\n\n- Requesting words with a prefix that doesn't exist.\n\n- Empty strings.\n\nI need to decide how to handle empty strings. Perhaps I'll allow them, but I need to ensure that the Trie can distinguish between an empty string and the root node.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the Trie nodes. I'll use a Node class as I sketched earlier, with a map of characters to child nodes, and a boolean flag for end of word.\n\nI might also want to store the character value in each node for easier traversal and word reconstruction, but it's not strictly necessary if I can keep track of the path during traversal.\n\nWait, actually, to reconstruct words, it's helpful to store the character value in each node. That way, when collecting all words with a prefix, I can build the words by traversing the Trie and accumulating the characters along the path.\n\nSo, I'll modify the Node class to include the character value.\n\nclass Node {\n\nchar character;\n\nMap<Character, Node> children = new HashMap<>();\n\nboolean isEndOfWord;\n\npublic Node(char character) {\n\nthis.character = character;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis way, each node knows what character it represents.\n\nBut, the root node doesn't represent any character. Maybe I'll make the root node a special case, with a null character.\n\nWait, in Java, char is not nullable. So, perhaps I'll use a space or some other special character for the root.\n\nAlternatively, I can make the root node have a dummy character, say '\\0', to indicate it's the root.\n\nBut, to keep it simple, maybe I'll just have the root node be a Node with isEndOfWord false, and an empty character.\n\nWait, but in Java, char cannot be null, so I need to decide on a representation for the root.\n\nMaybe I'll make the root node have a character ' ' (space), and consider it as not part of any word.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a separate RootNode class, but that might be overkill.\n\nI think the simplest way is to have all nodes, including the root, have a character, and treat the root's character as a dummy value.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps I'll set the root's character to a special value like '\\0'.\n\nIn Java, '\\0' is allowed, but it's not very readable. Maybe using a space ' ' is better.\n\nSo, root node has character ' ', and other nodes have their actual characters.\n\nThis should work for now.\n\nNext, I need to think about how to implement the insertion method.\n\npublic void insert(String word) {\n\nif (word == null) {\n\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"Word cannot be null\");\n\n}\n\nNode current = root;\n\nfor (char c : word.toCharArray()) {\n\ncurrent = current.children.computeIfAbsent(c, Node::new);\n\n}\n\ncurrent.isEndOfWord = true;\n\n}\n\nWait, in this code, Node::new expects a char, but Node's constructor takes a char. So, this should work.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the Node's character is set correctly.\n\nWait, in this case, when I do Node::new, it will call new Node(c), which sets the character to c.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, for the search method:\n\npublic boolean search(String word) {\n\nif (word == null) {\n\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"Word cannot be null\");\n\n}\n\nNode current = root;\n\nfor (char c : word.toCharArray()) {\n\ncurrent = current.children.get(c);\n\nif (current == null) {\n\nreturn false;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn current.isEndOfWord;\n\n}\n\nThis seems straightforward. It traverses the Trie based on the characters in the word and checks if the final node is marked as the end of a word.\n\nNext, the deletion method is more complex. I need to traverse to the end node and set isEndOfWord to false. But, if the node has no children, I can optionally remove it, provided it's not part of another word's path.\n\nWait, but if I remove a node that's part of another word's path, I'll disconnect the Trie.\n\nSo, I need to be careful only to remove nodes that are not used by any other words.\n\nThis might require a recursive approach, where after setting isEndOfWord to false, I check if the node has no children and is not the end of any other word, then remove it from its parent's children map.\n\nBut, this could be inefficient if done naively, as I might need to traverse back up the tree.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to traverse to the end node, set isEndOfWord to false, and then work backwards, removing any nodes that have no children and are not the end of any word.\n\nThis way, I can remove unused nodes while preserving the structure for other words.\n\nHere's a rough idea:\n\npublic void delete(String word) {\n\nif (word == null) {\n\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"Word cannot be null\");\n\n}\n\nNode current = root;\n\nStack<Node> path = new Stack<>();\n\npath.push(current);\n\nfor (char c : word.toCharArray()) {\n\ncurrent = current.children.get(c);\n\nif (current == null) {\n\nreturn; // Word doesn't exist\n\n}\n\npath.push(current);\n\n}\n\n// At this point, current is the end node of the word\n\nif (!current.isEndOfWord) {\n\nreturn; // Word isn't actually in the Trie\n\n}\n\ncurrent.isEndOfWord = false;\n\n// Now, remove any ancestors that have no children and are not end of word\n\nNode parent = null;\n\nwhile (!path.isEmpty()) {\n\ncurrent = path.pop();\n\nif (current.isEndOfWord || !current.children.isEmpty()) {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\nparent = path.isEmpty() ? null : path.peek();\n\nif (parent != null) {\n\nparent.children.remove(current.character);\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nIn this code, I keep a stack to record the path from the root to the end node. After setting isEndOfWord to false, I iterate backwards from the end node, removing any nodes that have no children and are not the end of any word.\n\nThis way, I only remove nodes that are no longer used by any words.\n\nNow, for the method to return all words with a given prefix.\n\nI need to traverse the Trie to the end of the prefix, and then perform a depth-first search to collect all words from there.\n\nTo do this, I'll need a helper method that takes a node and the prefix string accumulated so far, and collects all words from that node downwards.\n\nHere's a sketch:\n\npublic List<String> wordsWithPrefix(String prefix) {\n\nif (prefix == null) {\n\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"Prefix cannot be null\");\n\n}\n\nNode current = root;\n\nfor (char c : prefix.toCharArray()) {\n\ncurrent = current.children.get(c);\n\nif (current == null) {\n\nreturn new ArrayList<>();\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn collectWords(current, prefix);\n\n}\n\nprivate List<String> collectWords(Node node, String prefix) {\n\nList<String> words = new ArrayList<>();\n\nif (node.isEndOfWord) {\n\nwords.add(prefix);\n\n}\n\nfor (Map.Entry<Character, Node> entry : node.children.entrySet()) {\n\nchar c = entry.getKey();\n\nNode child = entry.getValue();\n\nwords.addAll(collectWords(child, prefix + c));\n\n}\n\nreturn words;\n\n}\n\nIn this code, wordsWithPrefix traverses to the end of the prefix, and then calls collectWords to perform a DFS and collect all words from that point, appending the appropriate characters to the prefix.\n\nThis should give me all words that start with the given prefix.\n\nI need to make sure that the root node is handled correctly, and that the prefix traversal doesn't go beyond the existing prefix in the Trie.\n\nAlso, if the prefix itself is not present in the Trie, I should return an empty list.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- Prefix is the empty string: should return all words in the Trie.\n\n- Prefix is a single character.\n\n- Prefix is a whole word.\n\n- Prefix doesn't exist in the Trie.\n\n- Words with overlapping prefixes.\n\n- Case sensitivity: assuming all inputs are lowercase for simplicity.\n\n- Null inputs: should throw IllegalArgumentException.\n\n- Empty Trie: should handle gracefully.\n\nI should also consider the time and space complexity of each operation.\n\nInsertion and deletion are O(m), where m is the length of the word, since they involve traversing the string's length.\n\nSearch is also O(m), for the same reason.\n\nRetrieving all words with a prefix could be up to O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the Trie, in the worst case.\n\nSpace-wise, the Trie can be space-intensive if there are many unique prefixes, but it's efficient for operations involving prefixes.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Java, ensuring that the class is well-encapsulated, with private inner classes for nodes, and public methods for the operations.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify that the Trie works as expected.\n\nFor example:\n\nTrie trie = new Trie();\n\ntrie.insert(\"cat\");\n\ntrie.insert(\"car\");\n\ntrie.insert(\"dog\");\n\nSystem.out.println(trie.search(\"cat\")); // true\n\nSystem.out.println(trie.search(\"ca\")); // false\n\nSystem.out.println(trie.wordsWithPrefix(\"ca\")); // [\"cat\", \"car\"]\n\ntrie.delete(\"cat\");\n\nSystem.out.println(trie.search(\"cat\")); // false\n\nSystem.out.println(trie.search(\"car\")); // true\n\nSystem.out.println(trie.wordsWithPrefix(\"ca\")); // [\"car\"]\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Let's proceed to implement the Trie class in Java.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement a Trie data structure in Java that supports insertion, deletion, search operations, and retrieving all words with a given prefix, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Node Structure**: Each node in the Trie contains a map of characters to child nodes and a flag to indicate the end of a word.\n2. **Insertion**: Traverse the Trie, creating new nodes for each character in the word if they don't already exist. Mark the end node as the end of a word.\n3. **Search**: Traverse the Trie based on the characters in the word and check if the final node is marked as the end of a word.\n4. **Deletion**: Traverse to the end node, unset the end of word flag, and recursively remove any empty child nodes.\n5. **Prefix Search**: Traverse to the end of the prefix and perform a depth-first search to collect all words from that node.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass Trie {\n    private class Node {\n        char character;\n        Map<Character, Node> children = new HashMap<>();\n        boolean isEndOfWord;\n\n        public Node(char character) {\n            this.character = character;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private Node root;\n\n    public Trie() {\n        root = new Node(' ');\n    }\n\n    public void insert(String word) {\n        if (word == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Word cannot be null\");\n        }\n        Node current = root;\n        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {\n            current = current.children.computeIfAbsent(c, Node::new);\n        }\n        current.isEndOfWord = true;\n    }\n\n    public boolean search(String word) {\n        if (word == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Word cannot be null\");\n        }\n        Node current = root;\n        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {\n            current = current.children.get(c);\n            if (current == null) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return current.isEndOfWord;\n    }\n\n    public void delete(String word) {\n        if (word == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Word cannot be null\");\n        }\n        Node current = root;\n        Stack<Node> path = new Stack<>();\n        path.push(current);\n        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {\n            current = current.children.get(c);\n            if (current == null) {\n                return; // Word doesn't exist\n            }\n            path.push(current);\n        }\n        // At this point, current is the end node of the word\n        if (!current.isEndOfWord) {\n            return; // Word isn't actually in the Trie\n        }\n        current.isEndOfWord = false;\n        // Now, remove any ancestors that have no children and are not end of word\n        Node parent = null;\n        while (!path.isEmpty()) {\n            current = path.pop();\n            if (current.isEndOfWord || !current.children.isEmpty()) {\n                break;\n            }\n            parent = path.isEmpty() ? null : path.peek();\n            if (parent != null) {\n                parent.children.remove(current.character);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public List<String> wordsWithPrefix(String prefix) {\n        if (prefix == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Prefix cannot be null\");\n        }\n        Node current = root;\n        for (char c : prefix.toCharArray()) {\n            current = current.children.get(c);\n            if (current == null) {\n                return new ArrayList<>();\n            }\n        }\n        return collectWords(current, prefix);\n    }\n\n    private List<String> collectWords(Node node, String prefix) {\n        List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();\n        if (node.isEndOfWord) {\n            words.add(prefix);\n        }\n        for (Map.Entry<Character, Node> entry : node.children.entrySet()) {\n            char c = entry.getKey();\n            Node child = entry.getValue();\n            words.addAll(collectWords(child, prefix + c));\n        }\n        return words;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Node Class**: Represents each node in the Trie, holding a character, a map of children nodes, and a flag indicating the end of a word.\n- **Insert Operation**: Iterates through each character in the word, creating new nodes as necessary, and marks the end of the word.\n- **Search Operation**: Traverses the Trie based on the word's characters and checks if the word exists by verifying the end of word flag.\n- **Delete Operation**: Navigates to the end of the word, unsets the end of word flag, and removes any unused nodes from the Trie.\n- **Prefix Search Operation**: Finds the prefix in the Trie and collects all words from the prefix endpoint using depth-first search.\n\nThis implementation ensures efficient handling of string operations based on prefixes, suitable for applications like auto-completion and spell-checking."
