        "content": "In this task, you're being asked to write a sonnet with a specific constraint: each line's first word must start with the same letter as the last word of the previous line. A sonnet is a 14-line poem, typically following a specific rhyme scheme and structure. The most common forms are the Shakespearean sonnet and the Petrarchan sonnet, each with their own rhyme schemes and structural characteristics.\n\nFor this exercise, you need to focus on the letter\u8854\u63a5 between lines rather than the traditional rhyme scheme. This creates a kind of chain where the last word of one line dictates the starting letter of the next line's first word.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to tackle this task:\n\n1. **Choose a Theme or Subject:** Since a sonnet usually revolves around a central theme or idea, decide what you want your poem to be about. This will help in maintaining coherence despite the letter constraint.\n\n2. **Plan the Structure:** Outline the sequence of first and last words to ensure that each line connects appropriately. This might require some pre-planning to find words that not only start and end with the required letters but also make sense in the context of the poem.\n\n3. **Start Writing:** Begin with the first line, ensuring that its last word will set the starting letter for the second line. Continue this pattern throughout the 14 lines.\n\n4. **Maintain Sonnet Characteristics:** Although the primary constraint is the letter connection, try to adhere to other sonnet characteristics such as iambic pentameter (if possible) and the division into quatrains and a couplet, depending on the sonnet form you're aiming for.\n\n5. **Revise and Refine:** After drafting the sonnet, review it to ensure that the connections are smooth and that the poem maintains its thematic integrity. Make adjustments as necessary to improve flow and meaning.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example to illustrate the concept:\n\n- **Line 1:** \"In shadows, where the moonlight gently flows,\"\n- **Line 2:** \"Softly whispers the night, its secrets disclose.\"\n- **Line 3:** \"Secrets hidden in the silent sighs,\"\n- **Line 4:** \"Sighs that echo through the starry skies.\"\n- **Line 5:** \"Skies so vast, they mirror dreams afar,\"\n- **Line 6:** \"Far beyond where mortal eyes can tar.\"\n- **Line 7:** \"Tarred by day's harsh light, we seek repose,\"\n- **Line 8:** \"Poses in darkness, where the soul composed.\"\n- **Line 9:** \"Composed and calm, in night's embrace we lie,\"\n- **Line 10:** \"Lie beneath the cosmos, high and nigh.\"\n- **Line 11:** \"Nigh to heaven, where angels softly sing,\"\n- **Line 12:** \"Sing their hymns, and all is mended, mending.\"\n- **Line 13:** \"Mending wounds of day, in night's soft glow,\"\n- **Line 14:** \"Glow that guides us to a better know.\"\n\nIn this example, each line starts with a word that begins with the same letter as the last word of the previous line (e.g., \"flows\" ends Line 1, and \"Softly\" starts Line 2).\n\nRemember, the challenge is to create a coherent and meaningful sonnet while adhering to this unique letter connection rule. Good luck with your composition!"
