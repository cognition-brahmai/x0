        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a street with houses on both sides, 10 on one side and 12 on the other, each numbered uniquely from 1 to 22. The sum of the house numbers on one side equals the sum of the house numbers on the other side, and we need to find the number of the first house on the side with 10 houses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are 22 houses in total, each with a unique number from 1 to 22. They're divided into two groups: one with 10 houses and another with 12 houses. The sums of the house numbers in these two groups are equal, and I need to find the number of the first house on the side with 10 houses.\n\nI should probably start by calculating the total sum of all house numbers from 1 to 22. I recall that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula n(n+1)/2. So, for n=22, the total sum is 22*23/2 = 253.\n\nNow, let's denote the sum of the house numbers on the side with 10 houses as S, and the sum on the side with 12 houses as S as well, since they're equal. Therefore, S + S = 253, which means 2S = 253, so S = 253/2 = 126.5. Wait, but house numbers are integers, and their sums should also be integers. However, 126.5 is not an integer, which suggests there might be an issue with my approach.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that the sum S might not be equal to half of the total sum because perhaps not all numbers from 1 to 22 are used, or maybe there's a different interpretation. But the problem says there are 10 houses on one side and 12 on the other, with unique numbers from 1 to 22, so I think the total sum should be 253.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for two subsets of sizes 10 and 12 from the numbers 1 to 22, each subset summing to 126 or 127, but since 253 is odd, it can't be split into two equal integer sums. This is confusing.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem doesn't specify that the sums are equal, but that the sum on one side is equal to the sum on the other side plus or minus something. Or perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the problem statement.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"The sum of the house numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the house numbers on the other side.\" So, the sums are equal, but my calculation suggests that's not possible because 253 is odd and can't be split into two equal integer sums.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a typo or there's additional information I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe the houses aren't numbered from 1 to 22 consecutively.\n\nWait, maybe the houses are numbered from 1 to 22, but not all numbers are necessarily used. But the problem says \"each house has a unique number from 1 to 22,\" which implies that all numbers from 1 to 22 are used, with 10 on one side and 12 on the other.\n\nThis seems contradictory because the total sum is odd, and equal division into two subsets isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"first house\" refers to the house with the smallest number on the side with 10 houses.\n\nLet me explore that. Suppose the side with 10 houses has house numbers a1, a2, ..., a10, and the side with 12 houses has b1, b2, ..., b12, all unique from 1 to 22.\n\nGiven that the sum of a1 through a10 equals the sum of b1 through b12, and we need to find a1, the smallest number on the side with 10 houses.\n\nBut without additional constraints, this seems too vague to solve directly. Maybe I need to consider the minimal possible sum for the side with 10 houses and see if it can equal the sum of the remaining 12 houses.\n\nLet's try to find the minimal possible sum for the side with 10 houses. The smallest 10 numbers are 1 through 10, which sum to 55. The remaining 12 numbers are 11 through 22, which sum to 253 - 55 = 198. These sums are not equal.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to make the sum of the side with 10 houses as large as possible, using numbers 13 through 22, which sum to 165, and the remaining side with numbers 1 through 12, summing to 78. Again, sums are not equal.\n\nSo, it seems impossible to have equal sums under these conditions. Maybe the problem has a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the house numbers are not necessarily consecutive, just unique from 1 to 22, and assigned in such a way that the sums are equal.\n\nIn that case, I need to select 10 numbers out of 22 such that their sum equals the sum of the remaining 12 numbers.\n\nGiven that the total sum is 253, and S = 126.5 isn't possible, perhaps the problem has an error, or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies that the sums are as close as possible, not necessarily exactly equal.\n\nBut the problem states \"the sum of the house numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the house numbers on the other side,\" which suggests they are equal.\n\nPerhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem. Let me read it again: \"In a small town, there are 10 houses on one side of the street and 12 houses on the other side. Each house has a unique number from 1 to 22. The sum of the house numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the house numbers on the other side. What is the number of the first house on the side with 10 houses?\"\n\nGiven that, and my earlier reasoning, it seems there's an inconsistency because the total sum is odd, and equal division isn't possible.\n\nMaybe the problem assumes that one side has a sum of S and the other side has a sum of S + 0.5, but that doesn't make sense with integer house numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the house numbers are not from 1 to 22 but something else. Or maybe the problem has a different context.\n\nWait, perhaps the houses are numbered from 1 to 22, but the street is divided such that the sum of the house numbers on each side is equal, and I need to find the number of the first house on the side with 10 houses.\n\nGiven that equal division isn't possible because 253 is odd, maybe the problem is to find the closest possible sums.\n\nBut the problem specifically says the sums are equal, which seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"first house\" refers to the house with the lowest number on the side with 10 houses, and I need to find which number that is.\n\nPerhaps I need to select 10 numbers out of 1 to 22 such that their sum is as close as possible to 126.5, but again, equality seems impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is misphrased, and the sums are supposed to be as close as possible, not necessarily equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a house number that, when assigned to the side with 10 houses, makes the sums equal.\n\nGiven the contradiction, maybe I need to assume that the sum on each side is as close as possible to half of 253, which is 126.5.\n\nSo, perhaps the side with 10 houses has a sum of 126 or 127, and the side with 12 houses has the remaining sum.\n\nBut the problem specifically says the sums are equal, so perhaps it's a trick question, and there is no such arrangement.\n\nHowever, that seems unlikely for a problem posed for solving.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"first house\" refers to a specific house, and I need to find its number based on the given conditions.\n\nI need to think differently. Perhaps consider that the houses are arranged in order, and the first house on the side with 10 houses is the smallest number among the 10 houses on that side.\n\nGiven that, I need to select 10 numbers out of 1 to 22, with sum S, and the remaining 12 numbers sum to S as well, which totals to 2S = 253, which is impossible since 253 is odd.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps there is additional information I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the houses are not numbered from 1 to 22 uniquely; perhaps there are duplicates, but the problem says unique numbers.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the sum on one side is equal to the sum on the other side, but the sums are not necessarily equal to half of 253, because perhaps not all numbers from 1 to 22 are used.\n\nBut the problem says each house has a unique number from 1 to 22, with 10 on one side and 12 on the other, so all numbers from 1 to 22 are used.\n\nGiven that, the total sum is 253, which is odd, and it's impossible to split into two equal integer sums.\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the problem or in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to minimize the difference in sums, but it specifically says the sums are equal.\n\nI'm stuck here. Maybe I need to accept that, under these conditions, it's impossible to have equal sums, and therefore, there is no solution.\n\nHowever, that seems like giving up too easily. Perhaps there's a different approach or a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the houses are not necessarily numbered with all numbers from 1 to 22; perhaps some numbers are missing. But the problem says each house has a unique number from 1 to 22, with 10 on one side and 12 on the other, totaling 22 houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the street has houses numbered from 1 to 22 on one side and 1 to 22 on the other side, but that would mean duplicate numbers, which contradicts \"unique numbers.\"\n\nI'm going in circles here. Perhaps I should consider that the problem has a typo, and it's meant to have an even total sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to arrange the houses such that the sums are as close as possible, and then find the first house on the side with 10 houses.\n\nBut again, the problem specifically states that the sums are equal.\n\nGiven that, and the total sum being odd, I conclude that there is no such arrangement possible, and thus, no solution exists under the given constraints.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that no such arrangement exists because the total sum of house numbers is odd, making it impossible to divide into two equal sums.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No such arrangement exists}} \\]"
