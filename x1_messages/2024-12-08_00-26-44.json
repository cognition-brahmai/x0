        "content": "To determine how many 1-foot by 1-foot square tiles are needed to cover a rectangular room that measures 15 feet by 20 feet, we need to calculate the area of the room and then figure out how many tiles are required to cover that area.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the room. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. So, plugging in these values:\n\n\\[\nA = 20 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 15 \\, \\text{feet} = 300 \\, \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many 1-foot by 1-foot tiles are required to cover 300 square feet. Since each tile covers exactly 1 square foot, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area to be covered.\n\nTherefore, the number of tiles required is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of tiles} = 300\n\\]\n\nSo, you will need 300 tiles to cover the entire floor of the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
