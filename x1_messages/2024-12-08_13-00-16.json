However, the time around sunset can be associated with certain scents depending on your location.\n\nFor example, if you're near the ocean, you might smell the salty air or the scent of seaweed. In forests, the evening might bring out earthy smells from the soil and vegetation. Urban areas could have a mix of exhaust fumes, food cooking smells, and other urban scents. So while the sunset itself doesn't have a smell, the environment where you're watching it certainly does."
