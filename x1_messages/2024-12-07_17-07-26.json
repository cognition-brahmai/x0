        "content": "Alright, so John reads 2 pages of a book every day. After 10 days, he's read 25% of the book. I need to find out how many pages the book has in total. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many pages John has read in those 10 days. Since he reads 2 pages every day, I can multiply the number of pages per day by the number of days:\n\n\\[ \\text{Pages read} = 2 \\, \\text{pages/day} \\times 10 \\, \\text{days} = 20 \\, \\text{pages} \\]\n\nSo, John has read 20 pages in 10 days, and this amounts to 25% of the book. Now, I need to find out what 100% of the book is, since that's the total number of pages.\n\nIf 20 pages is 25% of the book, I can set up an equation to find the total number of pages, which I'll call \\( p \\). The equation would be:\n\n\\[ 25\\% \\times p = 20 \\]\n\nBut I know that 25% is the same as \\( \\frac{25}{100} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). So, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times p = 20 \\]\n\nTo find \\( p \\), I can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ p = 20 \\times 4 \\]\n\n\\[ p = 80 \\]\n\nSo, the book has 80 pages in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If John has read 20 pages, and that's 25% of the book, then indeed, the total number of pages should be 80, because 25% of 80 is 20. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. If 20 pages is to the total number of pages as 25% is to 100%, then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{p} = \\frac{25}{100} \\]\n\nAgain, simplifying the right side:\n\n\\[ \\frac{25}{100} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{p} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 4 = 1 \\times p \\]\n\n\\[ p = 80 \\]\n\nSame answer as before. Good, that matches.\n\nLet me consider another approach to ensure I'm not missing anything. If 20 pages represent 25% of the book, then each percentage point would correspond to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20 \\, \\text{pages}}{25} = 0.8 \\, \\text{pages per percent} \\]\n\nSo, for 100% of the book:\n\n\\[ 0.8 \\, \\text{pages/percent} \\times 100\\% = 80 \\, \\text{pages} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the initial reading rate. John reads 2 pages per day for 10 days, which is 20 pages, as I calculated earlier. If that's 25% of the book, then the total should indeed be 80 pages.\n\nI don't see any errors in my reasoning, and all methods point to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the book has 80 pages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
