        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a library has 5 copies of a certain book. Each copy can be borrowed for up to 4 weeks at a time. The question is, how many people can read the book in a year if each person takes exactly 4 weeks to read it? And I need to show my work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 5 copies of a book, and each copy can be borrowed for up to 4 weeks. Each person takes exactly 4 weeks to read it. I need to find out how many people can read the book in a year.\n\nAlright, so let's break this down. A year has 52 weeks, right? So, if each borrowing period is 4 weeks, then in a year, each copy can be borrowed multiple times, depending on how many 4-week periods there are in 52 weeks.\n\nSo, number of times one copy can be borrowed in a year is 52 divided by 4, which is 13 times.\n\nWait, but is that accurate? Because if someone borrows a book for 4 weeks, and then it's returned, and someone else borrows it immediately, and so on, then yes, each copy can be borrowed 13 times in a year.\n\nSo, for one copy, number of people who can read it in a year is 13.\n\nBut there are 5 copies, so total number of people who can read the book in a year would be 5 times 13, which is 65.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again. Each copy can be borrowed 13 times in a year, and there are 5 copies, so 5 times 13 is 65.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider whether there are enough people wanting to borrow the book. The problem doesn't specify any limitation on the number of people wanting to borrow the book, so I can assume that there are enough people wanting to borrow it.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"each person takes exactly 4 weeks to read it,\" so no one takes more or less time, which simplifies things.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 65 people can read the book in a year.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's check the calculations again.\n\nNumber of weeks in a year: 52\n\nEach borrowing period: 4 weeks\n\nNumber of times one copy can be borrowed in a year: 52 / 4 = 13\n\nNumber of copies: 5\n\nTotal number of people who can read the book in a year: 13 * 5 = 65\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]"
