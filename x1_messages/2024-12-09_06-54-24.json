        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 people at this family gathering, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many people there are and how many handshakes each person makes. There are 10 people, and each shakes hands with 9 others, right? Because you don't shake hands with yourself. So, if each of the 10 people shakes hands with 9 others, that would be 10 times 9, which is 90 handshakes.\n\nBut wait, that seems too high. I think I'm double-counting here. Because when person A shakes hands with person B, that's one handshake, not two. So, in my previous calculation, I've counted that handshake twice: once for person A and once for person B.\n\nTo correct for that, I need to divide the total by 2. So, 90 divided by 2 is 45. Maybe the total number of handshakes is 45.\n\nLet me think of another way to approach this. Maybe using combinations. I recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items from n items is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n is 10, since there are 10 people. So, C(10, 2) would be 10 times 9 divided by 2, which is 45. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If there are 2 people, they shake hands once. With 3 people, there are 3 handshakes. With 4 people, there are 6 handshakes. I can see a pattern here: 2 people \u2014 1 handshake, 3 people \u2014 3 handshakes, 4 people \u2014 6 handshakes. It seems like each time I add a person, they shake hands with everyone already present.\n\nSo, for 10 people, if I add them one by one, the first person doesn't shake hands with anyone (since there's no one else). The second person shakes hands with the first person (1 handshake). The third person shakes hands with the first two (2 handshakes). The fourth person shakes hands with the first three (3 handshakes), and so on, up to the tenth person shaking hands with the first nine (9 handshakes).\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be the sum of the first 9 natural numbers: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9.\n\nLet me add those up: 0 + 1 is 1, plus 2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15, plus 6 is 21, plus 7 is 28, plus 8 is 36, plus 9 is 45. Again, 45 handshakes.\n\nThis matches both my earlier calculations. So, I'm confident that the total number of handshakes is 45.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe some people don't shake hands with each other due to family feuds, but the problem says each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether handshakes are simultaneous or something, but again, the problem states that each pair shakes hands exactly once, so it's straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer should be 45 handshakes in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
