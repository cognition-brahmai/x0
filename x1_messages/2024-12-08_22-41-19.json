        "content": "Let's tackle this marble problem. So, the problem says that 4 out of every 7 marbles are red, and there are 21 marbles in total. I need to find out how many are red.\n\nFirst, I think about what \"4 out of every 7 marbles are red\" means. It means that in every group of 7 marbles, 4 are red. So, if I can find out how many groups of 7 there are in 21 marbles, I can then multiply that by 4 to find the number of red marbles.\n\nLet me see, 21 divided by 7 is 3. So, there are 3 groups of 7 marbles in 21. Since each group has 4 red marbles, I can multiply 3 by 4 to get 12. So, there are 12 red marbles.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to think about this. Perhaps I can use proportions. If 4 out of 7 marbles are red, then the proportion of red marbles is 4/7. To find out how many red marbles there are in 21 marbles, I can multiply the proportion by the total number of marbles.\n\nSo, that would be (4/7) * 21. Let's calculate that. 4 times 21 is 84, and 84 divided by 7 is 12. Again, 12 red marbles.\n\nHmm, both methods gave me the same answer, which is a good sign. But maybe I can think of it differently, just to confirm.\n\nLet's consider that if 4 out of 7 marbles are red, then the remaining 3 out of 7 are not red. So, in total, there are 21 marbles. If I can find out how many sets of 7 marbles there are, which is 3, then each set has 4 red marbles. So, 3 sets times 4 red marbles per set equals 12 red marbles.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of fractions, 4/7 of the marbles are red. So, 4/7 of 21 is 12.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use cross-multiplication or something like that. Let's set up a proportion:\n\n4 red marbles / 7 total marbles = x red marbles / 21 total marbles.\n\nThen, I can solve for x by cross-multiplying: 4 * 21 = 7 * x => 84 = 7x => x = 84 / 7 = 12.\n\nAgain, the same answer, 12 red marbles.\n\nI think I'm getting consistent results here, which makes me confident that 12 is the correct number of red marbles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other interpretations of the problem. For example, maybe the \"4 out of every 7 marbles are red\" doesn't mean a constant ratio throughout the bag, but perhaps it's only true for certain groups of marbles. However, the problem doesn't suggest any variation, so it's safe to assume that the ratio is consistent across the entire bag.\n\nAlso, the problem states that there are 21 marbles in total, which is a multiple of 7 (3 times 7 is 21), so the calculation is straightforward. If the total number of marbles wasn't a multiple of 7, I might need to adjust my approach, but in this case, it works out perfectly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of red to total marbles. The ratio is 4:7, which can be scaled up by multiplying both parts by the same factor. Since 7 * 3 = 21, then 4 * 3 = 12 red marbles.\n\nThis aligns with all the previous methods I've used, so again, it confirms that 12 is the correct number of red marbles.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from several angles and consistently arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence in the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
