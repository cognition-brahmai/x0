        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving from New York to Boston at 60 mph, and the other leaving from Boston to New York at 85 mph. The distance between the cities is 225 miles. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I think it's about finding the time when the two trains pass each other on the track. So, they're moving towards each other, and I need to find out after how many hours they will meet.\n\nOkay, so I know that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, the relative speed would be 60 mph + 85 mph = 145 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between them is 225 miles. To find the time, I can use the formula: time = distance / speed. So, time = 225 miles / 145 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that. 225 divided by 145. Hmm, that's the same as 45/29 hours. But maybe it's better to have it in decimal form. 145 times 1 is 145, subtract that from 225, gets 80. 145 times 0.5 is 72.5, subtract that from 80, gets 7.5. 145 times 0.05 is 7.25, subtract that from 7.5, gets 0.25. This is getting too messy. Maybe I should use division.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify 225/145. Both are divisible by 5, so 225 \u00f7 5 = 45, 145 \u00f7 5 = 29. So, 45/29 hours.\n\nBut maybe it's better to convert that to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can multiply 45/29 by 60 to get the time in minutes.\n\nSo, (45/29) * 60 = (45 * 60) / 29 = 2700 / 29.\n\nLet me calculate 29 times 90 is 2610, subtract that from 2700, gets 90. Then 29 times 3 is 87, subtract that from 90, gets 3. So, it's 93 minutes plus 3 minutes, which is 93 minutes.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. 29 times 90 is 2610, subtract from 2700, that's 90. Then 29 times 3 is 87, subtract that, gets 3. So, it's 90 + 3/29 minutes. But that's not precise. Maybe I should just leave it as 2700/29 minutes, which is approximately 93.1 minutes.\n\nSo, about 93 minutes. But maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to consider the time it takes for both trains to cover the combined distance. Since they're moving towards each other, the distance is closing at a rate of 145 mph, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, time = distance / relative speed = 225 / 145 hours.\n\nSimplifying that, as I did before, gives 45/29 hours, which is approximately 1.55 hours, or 1 hour and 33 minutes.\n\nWait, earlier I got 93 minutes, which is about 1 hour and 33 minutes, so that matches.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Like, are the trains starting at the same time? The question doesn't specify, but I think it's safe to assume they start at the same time, one from each city.\n\nAlso, I assume they're traveling on the same track, head-on towards each other.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate how long it takes for each train to cover the distance until they meet.\n\nLet's say they meet after t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train would have traveled 60t miles, and the second train would have traveled 85t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the total distance between the cities.\n\nSo, 60t + 85t = 225.\n\nCombining like terms, 145t = 225.\n\nThen, t = 225 / 145 = 45/29 hours, just like before.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I can check with another method.\n\nLet's think about the time it would take for each train to cover the entire distance if the other train wasn't there.\n\nFor the first train: time = 225 / 60 = 3.75 hours.\n\nFor the second train: time = 225 / 85 \u2248 2.65 hours.\n\nBut that doesn't directly help, because they're moving towards each other.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the concept of relative speed again.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the distance between them decreases at a rate equal to the sum of their speeds, which is 145 mph.\n\nSo, to cover 225 miles at 145 mph, it takes 225 / 145 hours, which is again 45/29 hours.\n\nI think I'm converging on the same answer repeatedly, which is a good sign.\n\nMaybe I can try to visualize it.\n\nImagine a straight line representing the 225 miles between New York and Boston.\n\nTrain A starts at New York, moving right at 60 mph.\n\nTrain B starts at Boston, moving left at 85 mph.\n\nI need to find the point where their paths cross.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of one train being stationary and the other moving at the combined speed.\n\nFor example, if Train B is stationary, then Train A is moving towards it at 60 + 85 = 145 mph.\n\nSo, it would take 225 / 145 hours to cover the distance, which is again 45/29 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if Train A is stationary, then Train B is moving towards it at 145 mph, and the time is the same.\n\nSo, all these approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nPerhaps I can convert 45/29 hours into minutes to make it more understandable.\n\nAs I did earlier, 45/29 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 2700 / 29 \u2248 93.1 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 1 hour and 33 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, to be more precise, 2700 \u00f7 29:\n\n29 * 90 = 2610\n\n2700 - 2610 = 90\n\n29 * 3 = 87\n\n90 - 87 = 3\n\nSo, 93 minutes and about 3/29 of a minute, which is roughly 0.1 minutes, or about 6 seconds.\n\nSo, approximately 1 hour, 33 minutes, and 6 seconds.\n\nBut maybe I'm getting too precise.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave the answer in hours as a fraction, 45/29 hours.\n\nBut I think it's more intuitive to think in minutes.\n\nSo, the trains will meet after approximately 1 hour and 33 minutes.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way to look at this problem.\n\nSuppose I want to find out how far each train has traveled when they meet.\n\nFor Train A: distance = speed * time = 60 mph * (45/29) hours = 2700/29 miles \u2248 93.1 miles.\n\nFor Train B: distance = 85 mph * (45/29) hours = 3825/29 miles \u2248 131.9 miles.\n\nAdding these distances: 93.1 + 131.9 = 225 miles, which matches the total distance.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of their speeds.\n\nTrain A is going at 60 mph, Train B at 85 mph.\n\nThe ratio of their speeds is 60:85, which simplifies to 12:17.\n\nThat means for every 12 parts Train A travels, Train B travels 17 parts.\n\nThe total parts are 12 + 17 = 29 parts.\n\nThe distance between the cities is 225 miles, so each part is 225 / 29 miles.\n\nTherefore, Train A travels 12 * (225 / 29) = 2700 / 29 \u2248 93.1 miles.\n\nTrain B travels 17 * (225 / 29) = 3825 / 29 \u2248 131.9 miles.\n\nAgain, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, all these different approaches are consistent, which gives me confidence in the answer.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the time from different reference points, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases and can conclude that the trains will meet after approximately 1 hour and 33 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour and } 33 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
