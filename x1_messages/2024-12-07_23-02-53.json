        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a factory that produces widgets in batches of 100. Each widget has a 5% chance of being defective. The factory tests 10 widgets from each batch, and if at least one of them is defective, the whole batch is rejected and has to be reworked. I need to find the probability that a batch will be accepted after testing.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what it means for a batch to be accepted. The batch is accepted if none of the 10 tested widgets are defective. So, the probability of acceptance is the probability that all 10 tested widgets are not defective.\n\nEach widget has a 5% chance of being defective, which means each has a 95% chance of being non-defective. Since the widgets are presumably independent, the probability that all 10 are non-defective is (0.95)^10.\n\nWait a minute, but is that really correct? Let's think about it. The probability that one widget is non-defective is 0.95. If the widgets are independent, then the probability that all 10 are non-defective is indeed (0.95)^10.\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.95 to the power of 10 is... let's see. 0.95^10 is approximately 0.5987. So, roughly 59.87%.\n\nBut, I should consider whether the widgets are really independent. For example, if there's some common factor that affects the defectiveness of multiple widgets in a batch, their defect statuses might not be independent. However, the problem doesn't mention any such dependency, so I'll assume independence.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether the testing is done with replacement or without replacement. The problem says that 10 widgets are tested from each batch of 100. If the testing is done without replacement, then the probability changes slightly because each test affects the probabilities for the next test.\n\nLet's explore that. If sampling is without replacement, then the probability that the first widget is non-defective is 95/100 = 0.95. If the first is non-defective, then there are 99 widgets left, of which 94.5 are expected to be non-defective, but since we can't have half a widget, maybe I should think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 10 non-defective widgets out of 95 non-defective ones (since 5% of 100 is 5 defective, so 95 are non-defective) is C(95,10), and the total number of ways to choose 10 widgets out of 100 is C(100,10). Therefore, the probability that all 10 tested widgets are non-defective is C(95,10)/C(100,10).\n\nLet me calculate that. C(95,10) is 95 choose 10, which is 95! / (10! * 85!), and C(100,10) is 100! / (10! * 90!). So, the ratio is (95! / (10! * 85!)) / (100! / (10! * 90!)) = (95! * 90!) / (100! * 85!) = (95 * 94 * ... * 86) / (100 * 99 * ... * 91).\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, the numerator is 95 * 94 * 93 * 92 * 91 * 90 * 89 * 88 * 87 * 86.\n\nThe denominator is 100 * 99 * 98 * 97 * 96 * 95 * 94 * 93 * 92 * 91.\n\nI can see that many terms will cancel out. Specifically, 95, 94, 93, 92, and 91 appear in both numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, canceling those out, we're left with 90 * 89 * 88 * 87 * 86 in the numerator, and 100 * 99 * 98 * 97 * 96 in the denominator.\n\nNow, let's calculate numerator: 90 * 89 = 8010; 8010 * 88 = 704880; 704880 * 87 = 61252560; 61252560 * 86 = 5264473760.\n\nDenominator: 100 * 99 = 9900; 9900 * 98 = 970200; 970200 * 97 = 94099400; 94099400 * 96 = 9031542400.\n\nSo, the probability is 5264473760 / 9031542400, which simplifies to approximately 0.5828.\n\nComparing this to the earlier calculation with sampling with replacement, where we got approximately 0.5987, there is a slight difference.\n\nBut in practice, when the sample size is small relative to the population size, sampling with or without replacement gives similar results. Here, sampling 10 out of 100 is 10%, which isn't negligible, so the difference is more pronounced.\n\nHowever, in industry, when dealing with acceptance sampling, it's common to use hypergeometric distribution for sampling without replacement, which is what I just did, or binomial distribution for sampling with replacement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider both approaches.\n\nSo, under sampling with replacement, the probability is (0.95)^10 \u2248 0.5987.\n\nUnder sampling without replacement, it's C(95,10)/C(100,10) \u2248 0.5828.\n\nNow, which one is more appropriate here? The problem doesn't specify whether sampling is with or without replacement. However, in a factory setting, it's more likely that they test 10 distinct widgets without replacement.\n\nTherefore, the hypergeometric approach might be more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, since 10 out of 100 is 10%, which is not very small, the difference between the two is noticeable.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the finite population correction factor. In sampling without replacement, the probability changes with each draw.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is probably expecting the simpler binomial approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the binomial approximation to the hypergeometric distribution.\n\nThe binomial approximation is reasonable when the sample size is less than 5% of the population size. Here, 10 out of 100 is 10%, which is greater than 5%, so the approximation may not be very accurate.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should stick with the hypergeometric calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can consider the probability that at least one is defective, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that none are defective.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one defective is 1 - probability of none defective.\n\nWhich is what I already calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the Poisson approximation.\n\nIf I consider the number of defective widgets in the sample, it can be modeled using a binomial distribution with n=10 and p=0.05.\n\nThe Poisson approximation to the binomial is good when n is large and p is small, which is somewhat the case here, but n=10 isn't very large.\n\nStill, for the sake of exploration, the Poisson parameter \u03bb would be n*p = 10*0.05 = 0.5.\n\nThe probability of zero defects in the Poisson distribution is e^(-\u03bb) = e^(-0.5) \u2248 0.6065.\n\nWhich is closer to the binomial with replacement result of approximately 0.5987.\n\nBut again, this is an approximation.\n\nPerhaps I should just stick with the hypergeometric calculation, as it is exact for sampling without replacement.\n\nSo, C(95,10)/C(100,10) \u2248 0.5828.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a batch will be accepted after testing is approximately 58.28%.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider the fact that the batch has 100 widgets, and even if the sample has no defects, there could still be defects in the unfampled widgets.\n\nHowever, the problem seems to be only considering the sample of 10 widgets for acceptance or rejection.\n\nSo, as long as the sample has no defects, the batch is accepted, regardless of whether there are defects in the remaining 90 widgets.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. In quality control, usually, the goal is to ensure that the entire batch meets certain quality standards.\n\nBut according to the problem, if at least one of the tested widgets is defective, the entire batch is rejected.\n\nTherefore, if the sample of 10 has no defects, the batch is accepted.\n\nSo, the probability we're seeking is indeed the probability that a sample of 10 has no defects.\n\nAnd as I calculated earlier, using the hypergeometric distribution, that's approximately 0.5828.\n\nAlternatively, using the binomial distribution (which assumes sampling with replacement), it's approximately 0.5987.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can provide both probabilities, but likely the hypergeometric is more appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use statistical software or a calculator to get a more precise value.\n\nBut since this is a theoretical exercise, perhaps giving the formula is sufficient.\n\nSo, the probability that a batch will be accepted after testing is given by the hypergeometric probability P(X=0), where X is the number of defective widgets in the sample of 10, drawn from a population of 100 widgets, of which 5 are defective.\n\nTherefore, P(X=0) = C(95,10) / C(100,10).\n\nCalculating this value gives approximately 0.5828, or 58.28%.\n\nSo, the batch has about a 58.28% chance of being accepted based on the sample test.\n\nAlternatively, using the binomial approximation, it's approximately 59.87%.\n\nGiven the choice, I'll go with the hypergeometric result, as it accounts for the sampling without replacement.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a batch will be accepted after testing is approximately 58.28%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5828} \\]"
