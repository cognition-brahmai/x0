        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Python script that validates an email address using regular expressions, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import the necessary module**: We'll use the `re` module in Python, which provides support for regular expressions.\n\n2. **Define a regular expression pattern**: This pattern will check if the email address follows the standard email format. Typically, an email address has a local part, followed by the \"@\" symbol, and then the domain part.\n\n3. **Get user input**: We'll prompt the user to enter an email address.\n\n4. **Validate the email address**: Use the regular expression pattern to check if the entered email matches the pattern.\n\n5. **Print the result**: Based on the validation, print whether the email is valid or invalid.\n\nHere's a simple Python script that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_email(email):\n    # Regular expression pattern for validating an email\n    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'\n    if re.match(pattern, email):\n        return \"Valid Email\"\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid Email\"\n\n# Get user input\nuser_email = input(\"Please enter your email address: \")\n\n# Validate and print the result\nprint(validate_email(user_email))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing the `re` module**: This module allows us to work with regular expressions in Python.\n\n2. **Defining the `validate_email` function**:\n   - The function takes an email address as input.\n   - It uses a regular expression pattern to check if the email address is valid.\n   - The pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$` breaks down as follows:\n     - `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: The local part of the email address, which can include letters, digits, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, and hyphens.\n     - `@`: The \"@\" symbol.\n     - `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: The domain name, which can include letters, digits, dots, and hyphens.\n     - `\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`: The top-level domain, which starts with a dot followed by at least two letters.\n\n3. **Getting user input**: We use the `input` function to prompt the user to enter their email address.\n\n4. **Validating the email and printing the result**: We call the `validate_email` function with the user's input and print whether the email is valid or invalid based on the function's return value.\n\nThis script should effectively validate most standard email addresses.
