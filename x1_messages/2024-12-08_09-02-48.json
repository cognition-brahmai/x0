        "content": "So Jane rented a car for 3 days and drove it for 200 miles. The car rental company charges a flat fee of $20 per day and an additional 10 cents per mile driven. I need to calculate the total cost for Jane.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for the days she rented the car. The flat fee is $20 per day, and she rented it for 3 days. So, the cost for the days would be:\n\n20 dollars/day * 3 days = 60 dollars\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost for the miles she drove. The charge is 10 cents per mile, and she drove 200 miles. So, the cost for the miles would be:\n\n0.10 dollars/mile * 200 miles = 20 dollars\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the cost for the days and the cost for the miles:\n\n60 dollars + 20 dollars = 80 dollars\n\nTherefore, Jane has to pay $80 for the car rental.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
