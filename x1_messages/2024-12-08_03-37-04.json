        "content": "Let's see... there are 5 houses in a row, each painted a different color. I need to figure out which color is the last house on the right based on some clues.\n\nFirst, the green house is immediately to the left of the white house. So, green and white are next to each other, with green on the left.\n\nSecond, the red house is in the middle. Since there are five houses, the middle one is the third house.\n\nThird, the blue house is the first on the left.\n\nLet me try to arrange them step by step.\n\nStarting with the blue house being first on the left. So, house 1 is blue.\n\nHouse 3 is red, since it's in the middle.\n\nNow, green is immediately to the left of white. So, wherever green is, white is right next to it on the right.\n\nWe have houses 1 to 5:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: ?\n\n3: Red\n\n4: ?\n\n5: ?\n\nNow, green is to the left of white. Possible pairs are:\n\n- House 1 and 2: But house 1 is blue, so can't be green.\n\n- House 2 and 3: But house 3 is red, so can't be white.\n\n- House 3 and 4: House 3 is red, so house 4 can be white, making house 3 green. But house 3 is red, so can't be green.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. House 3 is red, so it can't be green or white.\n\n- House 4 and 5: House 4 could be green, and house 5 white.\n\nThat seems possible.\n\nSo, let's assign:\n\nHouse 4: Green\n\nHouse 5: White\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: ?\n\n3: Red\n\n4: Green\n\n5: White\n\nAre there any other constraints? I think that's it.\n\nSo, the last house on the right is house 5, which is white.\n\nWait, but let's double-check if there are any other possibilities.\n\nAnother way to look at it: green is immediately to the left of white, and red is in the middle, and blue is the first on the left.\n\nIs there another way to arrange the colors?\n\nLet me try swapping some colors.\n\nIf I try to place green and white in houses 2 and 3, but house 3 is red, which is a conflict because house 3 can't be both red and green.\n\nSimilarly, houses 3 and 4: house 3 is red, so house 4 can't be white because white has to be immediately to the right of green.\n\nWait, in my earlier arrangement, house 4 is green and house 5 is white, which satisfies green being immediately to the left of white.\n\nAnd house 3 is red, as required.\n\nHouse 1 is blue, as required.\n\nWhat about house 2? It's still empty.\n\nWhat color is left for house 2? Since all houses have different colors, and we have blue, red, green, white already assigned, the remaining color must be assigned to house 2.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify what colors are available besides these, but from the clues, it seems only these colors are mentioned.\n\nWait, the question says \"each painted with a different color,\" but doesn't specify which colors are available.\n\nHowever, from the clues, we have green, white, red, blue mentioned.\n\nAssuming these are the only colors, but in the arrangement above, I've used four colors for five houses, which means one more color is needed for house 2.\n\nUnless one of the colors is repeated, but the question says each painted with a different color, so no repetition.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLet me re-read the question.\n\n\"There are 5 houses in a row, each painted with a different color. The green house is immediately to the left of the white house. The red house is in the middle. The blue house is the first on the left. Which color is the last house on the right?\"\n\nSo, five houses, five different colors.\n\nColors mentioned: green, white, red, blue.\n\nSo, presumably, there are five colors in total, including another color not mentioned yet.\n\nLet's assume the colors are green, white, red, blue, and yellow.\n\nSo, house 1: blue\n\nHouse 2: yellow\n\nHouse 3: red\n\nHouse 4: green\n\nHouse 5: white\n\nThis satisfies all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the last house on the right is white.\n\nAlternatively, if another color is used instead of yellow, as long as it's different and not green, white, red, or blue, it wouldn't affect the position of the last house.\n\nBut since the question asks for the color of the last house, and based on the clues, it's white.\n\nSo, the answer should be white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{white}} \\]"
