Quito is indeed located at a high elevation, sitting at approximately 2,850 meters (9,350 feet) above sea level. This makes it one of the highest capital cities in the world. It's known for its well-preserved historic center, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its blend of colonial architecture and modern development. Quito is located in the Guayllabamba river basin, nestling in the Andes mountains and is the second most populous city in Ecuador after Guayaquil."
