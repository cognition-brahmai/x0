        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. The gardener wants to plant flowers along the perimeter, putting one flower every 2 feet. I need to figure out how many flowers they'll need.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the perimeter of the garden is, since that's where the flowers are going to be planted. I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. So, for a rectangle, it's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * length + 2 * width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * 30 feet + 2 * 20 feet\n\nThat would be:\n\nPerimeter = 60 feet + 40 feet = 100 feet\n\nSo, the perimeter is 100 feet.\n\nNow, the gardener wants to plant one flower every 2 feet along this perimeter. To find out how many flowers are needed, I can divide the total perimeter by the spacing between the flowers.\n\nNumber of flowers = Perimeter / spacing\n\nNumber of flowers = 100 feet / 2 feet\n\nThat gives:\n\nNumber of flowers = 50\n\nWait a minute, but I need to think about whether this makes sense. If I plant a flower every 2 feet along a 100-foot perimeter, shouldn't I have 50 flowers? Let me visualize this.\n\nImagine starting at one corner and planting a flower there. Then, every 2 feet along the perimeter, another flower. So, after 2 feet, one flower; after 4 feet, another, and so on, until I complete the 100 feet.\n\nBut here's something to consider: when I get back to the starting point, which is also part of the perimeter, do I plant another flower there, or does the first flower cover that spot?\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I have a closed loop, like a rectangle, and I'm placing flowers at regular intervals, the number of flowers should be equal to the perimeter divided by the spacing, assuming that the starting point is covered by the first flower and the last flower meets back at the start without doubling up.\n\nIn this case, since 100 feet divided by 2 feet is exactly 50, it should work out perfectly, with the 50th flower being placed back at the starting point.\n\nBut, to make sure, maybe I can check by considering smaller dimensions. Suppose the garden was 10 feet by 5 feet.\n\nPerimeter would be 2*10 + 2*5 = 30 feet.\n\nFlowers every 2 feet: 30 / 2 = 15 flowers.\n\nIf I start at one corner and go around:\n\n- Start at corner A (flower 1)\n\n- 2 feet to point B (flower 2)\n\n- 2 feet to point C (flower 3)\n\n- ...\n\n- Until I complete the perimeter and end up back at corner A with flower 15.\n\nWait, but 10 feet by 5 feet is a smaller rectangle. Let's calculate the perimeter again: 2*10 + 2*5 = 30 feet. 30 / 2 = 15 flowers.\n\nNow, if I actually map this out, starting at corner A, then every 2 feet along the perimeter:\n\n- Side AB: 10 feet, so 5 intervals (since 10 / 2 = 5), meaning 6 flowers (including both ends)\n\n- Side BC: 5 feet, 2.5 intervals, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 5 / 2 = 2.5, so that would be 3 flowers (including the corner).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe the number of flowers is equal to the perimeter divided by the spacing, but considering that each corner flower is shared by two sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of intervals between flowers being equal to the number of flowers, since it's a closed loop.\n\nIn the case of a circle, the number of flowers would be circumference divided by spacing. For a rectangle, it's similar, as the perimeter is a closed loop.\n\nSo, for the original problem: perimeter = 100 feet, spacing = 2 feet.\n\nNumber of flowers = 100 / 2 = 50.\n\nThis seems consistent with the smaller example as well: perimeter 30 feet, spacing 2 feet, number of flowers 15.\n\nTherefore, for the original garden, the gardener will need 50 flowers.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or miscalculation at the corners.\n\nSuppose I start at corner A and plant a flower there. Then every 2 feet along the perimeter:\n\n- Along the length of 30 feet: flowers at 0, 2, 4, ..., 30 feet (16 flowers, since 30 / 2 = 15 intervals, plus the starting flower)\n\n- Along the width of 20 feet: flowers at 30, 32, 34, ..., 50 feet (11 flowers, since 20 / 2 = 10 intervals, plus the starting flower of this side)\n\n- Along the second length of 30 feet: flowers at 50, 52, 54, ..., 80 feet (16 flowers, including the starting flower of this side)\n\n- Along the second width of 20 feet: flowers at 80, 82, 84, ..., 100 feet (11 flowers, including the starting flower of this side, which is also the starting point)\n\nNow, adding these up: 16 + 11 + 16 + 11 = 54 flowers.\n\nBut wait, this seems more than the initial calculation of 50. What's going on here?\n\nI think the issue is that in this approach, flowers at the corners are being double-counted, since each corner is the starting point for two sides.\n\nLet me see: each corner flower is counted once for each side that meets at the corner.\n\nSo, for four corners, each corner flower is counted twice in the total.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique flowers would be the sum of flowers along all sides minus the number of corners (since each corner flower is counted twice).\n\nSo, total unique flowers = 54 - 4 = 50.\n\nThis matches the initial calculation of 100 / 2 = 50.\n\nTherefore, the gardener will need 50 flowers.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider that in a closed loop, the number of intervals between flowers is equal to the number of flowers.\n\nSo, perimeter is 100 feet, spacing is 2 feet, so number of intervals is 100 / 2 = 50.\n\nTherefore, number of flowers is 50.\n\nThis seems consistent across different approaches.\n\nSo, the final answer is 50 flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
