        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, the farmer has 10 animals in total: cows, pigs, and chickens. And he has more cows than pigs, and more pigs than chickens. Also, the total number of legs is 36.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how many legs each animal has:\n\n- Cows have 4 legs.\n\n- Pigs have 4 legs.\n\n- Chickens have 2 legs.\n\nAlright, so let's denote:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cows.\n\n- Let \\( p \\) be the number of pigs.\n\n- Let \\( h \\) be the number of chickens.\n\nWe know that:\n\n1. \\( c + p + h = 10 \\) (total number of animals)\n\n2. \\( 4c + 4p + 2h = 36 \\) (total number of legs)\n\nAlso, it's given that:\n\n3. \\( c > p \\)\n\n4. \\( p > h \\)\n\nI need to find the values of \\( c \\), \\( p \\), and \\( h \\) that satisfy all these conditions.\n\nFirst, maybe I can simplify the legs equation. Let's see:\n\n\\( 4c + 4p + 2h = 36 \\)\n\nI can factor out 2:\n\n\\( 2(2c + 2p + h) = 36 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 2c + 2p + h = 18 \\)\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( c + p + h = 10 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2c + 2p + h = 18 \\)\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\( (2c + 2p + h) - (c + p + h) = 18 - 10 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( c + p = 8 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c + p = 8 \\)\n\nBut from the first equation, \\( c + p + h = 10 \\), so \\( h = 10 - (c + p) = 10 - 8 = 2 \\)\n\nAlright, so \\( h = 2 \\)\n\nNow, I know that \\( p > h \\), and \\( h = 2 \\), so \\( p > 2 \\)\n\nAlso, \\( c > p \\), and \\( c + p = 8 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c = 8 - p \\), and since \\( c > p \\), \\( 8 - p > p \\), which means \\( 8 > 2p \\), so \\( p < 4 \\)\n\nBut \\( p > 2 \\), and \\( p \\) has to be an integer (since you can't have a fraction of a pig), so possible values for \\( p \\) are 3.\n\nLet me check:\n\nIf \\( p = 3 \\), then \\( c = 8 - 3 = 5 \\), and \\( h = 2 \\)\n\nNow, check the legs:\n\n\\( 4c + 4p + 2h = 4(5) + 4(3) + 2(2) = 20 + 12 + 4 = 36 \\), which matches.\n\nAlso, \\( c > p \\) (5 > 3), and \\( p > h \\) (3 > 2), so all conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other possible value for \\( p \\)?\n\nEarlier, I concluded \\( p < 4 \\) and \\( p > 2 \\), and since \\( p \\) must be an integer, \\( p = 3 \\) is the only option.\n\nSo, the farmer has 5 cows, 3 pigs, and 2 chickens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ cows}, 3 \\text{ pigs}, 2 \\text{ chickens}} \\]"
