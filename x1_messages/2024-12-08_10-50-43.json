        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company has monthly expenses of $5,000 for rent and utilities. They make an average profit of $20 per product sold. I need to figure out how many products they need to sell each month to cover those expenses.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The company has fixed expenses each month, which are $5,000 for rent and utilities. These are costs that don't change based on how many products they sell. Then, for each product they sell, they make a profit of $20. Profit per unit, I guess you could call it.\n\nSo, the goal is to find out how many units they need to sell so that the total profit from selling those units equals the monthly expenses.\n\nLet me think about this. If they sell one product, they make $20 in profit. So, for two products, it's $40, and so on. It's a straightforward multiplication: profit per unit times the number of units sold.\n\nI need to find the number of units where the total profit equals the expenses. So, mathematically, it's:\n\nNumber of units \u00d7 profit per unit = expenses\n\nOr, in equation form:\n\nn \u00d7 20 = 5000\n\nWhere n is the number of units.\n\nTo find n, I just need to divide both sides by 20:\n\nn = 5000 / 20\n\nLet me do that calculation. 5000 divided by 20 is 250.\n\nSo, the company needs to sell 250 products each month to cover their rent and utility expenses.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If they sell 250 products at $20 profit each, that's indeed 250 \u00d7 20 = 5000, which matches the expenses.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider here? Are there any variable costs or other factors that might affect the profit per unit? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so I'll assume that the $20 profit per product is net profit, meaning all other costs are already accounted for.\n\nSo, my final answer is 250 products need to be sold each month to cover the rent and utility expenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
