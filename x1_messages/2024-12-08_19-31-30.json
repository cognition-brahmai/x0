        "content": "So I've got this problem here: an office building uses 60 light bulbs, each lasting around 1000 hours before needing replacement. The lights are on for 10 hours each day. I need to figure out how many days will pass before all the bulbs need replacing. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 60 light bulbs, each with a lifespan of 1000 hours. They're used for 10 hours each day. I need to find out after how many days all of them will have reached their lifespan and need replacing.\n\nI should probably start by figuring out how many days it takes for one bulb to burn out. Since each bulb lasts 1000 hours and is used 10 hours a day, I can divide the total lifespan by the daily usage to find the number of days before one bulb needs replacing.\n\nSo, for one bulb:\n\nLifespan = 1000 hours\n\nDaily usage = 10 hours/day\n\nNumber of days before replacement = Lifespan / Daily usage = 1000 hours / 10 hours/day = 100 days\n\nAlright, so one bulb will need replacing after 100 days.\n\nBut there are 60 bulbs. The question is, how many days will pass before all of them need replacing? If each bulb is independent and each lasts 100 days, then theoretically, if they all started at the same time, they would all need replacing after 100 days.\n\nHowever, in reality, bulbs don't all burn out at exactly the same time. Their lifespans can vary. But since the problem says each bulb lasts \"around\" 1000 hours, I think we're supposed to assume that they all last exactly 1000 hours for the sake of this calculation.\n\nSo, if all 60 bulbs are used for 10 hours each day, then after 100 days, each bulb will have accumulated 100 days * 10 hours/day = 1000 hours, which is their lifespan.\n\nTherefore, after 100 days, all the bulbs will need replacing.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe not all bulbs are used equally. Maybe some are used more than others. But the problem says \"each bulb lasts around 1000 hours before needing replacement,\" and \"the lights are on for 10 hours each day,\" so I think it's safe to assume that each bulb is used for 10 hours every day.\n\nSo, in that case, yes, after 100 days, each bulb will have been used for 1000 hours and will need replacing.\n\nI don't think the number of bulbs affects the calculation, because we're looking for when all bulbs need replacing, assuming they all start at the same time and are used equally.\n\nSo, my final answer is 100 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
