        "content": "Certainly! Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a basic implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction bubbleSort(arr) {\n    let n = arr.length;\n    for (let i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n        for (let j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {\n                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]\n                let temp = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = arr[j+1];\n                arr[j+1] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return arr;\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this function to sort an array of integers like this:\n\n```javascript\nlet array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];\nlet sortedArray = bubbleSort(array);\nconsole.log(sortedArray); // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n\u00b2), so it's not the most efficient for large arrays, but it's straightforward to understand and implement."
