        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to choose 3 books from a shelf that has 10 different books, but there's one specific book that must be included in my selection. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you're choosing items from a set without any restrictions, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 10 and k = 3, so normally, it would be C(10, 3). But there's a twist here\u2014one specific book must be included.\n\nSo, if one book is already chosen, that leaves me with two more books to choose, right? And since that specific book is already part of my selection, I don't need to choose it again. That means I'm actually choosing 2 books from the remaining books on the shelf.\n\nWait, but which books are remaining? If one specific book is already chosen, then the remaining books are 10 - 1 = 9 books. So, I need to choose 2 books from these 9.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 books from 9 would be C(9, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that. C(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9 - 2)!) = (9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 7!) = (9 \u00d7 8) / 2 = 72 / 2 = 36.\n\nSo, there are 36 ways to choose the remaining 2 books from the 9 books, given that one specific book is already included in my selection.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe by considering the total number of ways to choose 3 books from 10 and then subtracting the cases where the specific book is not included.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to choose 3 books from 10 is C(10, 3) = 120.\n\nNow, the number of ways to choose 3 books without including the specific book would be C(9, 3), since I'm choosing 3 books from the remaining 9 books that exclude the specific one.\n\nC(9, 3) = 84.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 books including the specific book would be the total ways minus the ways that exclude it: 120 - 84 = 36.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, both approaches lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me see if there's yet another way to think about this. Suppose I fix the specific book as one of the choices, then I need to choose the other two books from the remaining 9. That's again C(9, 2) = 36.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the specific book as already chosen, and then the problem reduces to choosing 2 more books from the remaining 9, which is again 36 ways.\n\nIt seems like no matter how I look at it, the answer is 36.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the order in which I choose the books matters. In combinations, order doesn't matter, which is appropriate here because the problem is about choosing books, not arranging them in a particular order.\n\nIf order did matter, it would be a permutation problem, but in this case, it's clearly a combination problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether books can be chosen more than once, but since it's a shelf of different books and I'm choosing distinct books, there's no repetition.\n\nAlso, all books are different, so there are no identical items to worry about.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 36 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can list out a smaller example to see if my logic holds.\n\nSuppose there are 4 books on the shelf: A, B, C, D, and the specific book that must be included is A. So, I need to choose 3 books including A.\n\nThe possible selections would be:\n\nA, B, C\n\nA, B, D\n\nA, C, D\n\nSo, there are 3 ways.\n\nUsing the formula, total ways would be C(3, 2) = 3, since one book is already chosen, and we choose 2 from the remaining 3.\n\nSimilarly, total ways without restriction: C(4, 3) = 4.\n\nWays excluding A: C(3, 3) = 1.\n\nSo, ways including A: 4 - 1 = 3, which matches.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with 10 books and choosing 3 including one specific book, it's C(9, 2) = 36.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
