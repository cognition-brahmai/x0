        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets at a rate of 100 widgets per hour. So, in an 8-hour workday, the total number of widgets produced would be:\n\n100 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 800 widgets\n\nNow, due to a malfunction, every 10th widget is defective. That means, out of every 10 widgets, 1 is defective and 9 are non-defective.\n\nTo find out how many non-defective widgets are produced in 800 widgets, we can calculate:\n\nTotal non-defective widgets = (9/10) \u00d7 total widgets\n\nSo,\n\nNon-defective widgets = (9/10) \u00d7 800 = 720 widgets\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by finding out how many defective widgets there are and subtracting that from the total.\n\nNumber of defective widgets = (1/10) \u00d7 800 = 80 widgets\n\nTherefore, non-defective widgets = total widgets - defective widgets = 800 - 80 = 720 widgets\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 720 non-defective widgets produced in an 8-hour workday.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a different approach or something I'm missing.\n\nAnother way could be to think about the production rate of non-defective widgets. Since every 10th widget is defective, the rate of non-defective widgets is 90 widgets per hour (since 100 - 10% of 100 = 90).\n\nSo, in 8 hours:\n\n90 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 720 widgets\n\nAgain, the same result. Seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the defective rate as a fraction.\n\nDefective rate = 1/10\n\nNon-defective rate = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10\n\nSo, non-defective widgets = (9/10) \u00d7 800 = 720\n\nNo matter how I look at it, the answer remains 720.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. The key here is understanding that every 10th widget is defective, which translates to 10% of the widgets being defective and 90% being non-defective.\n\nSo, in an 8-hour workday with 100 widgets produced per hour, totaling 800 widgets, 90% of those are non-defective:\n\n800 \u00d7 0.9 = 720\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI don't see any complicating factors in this problem. It seems straightforward once you grasp the defective rate and apply it to the total production.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the malfunction affects the production rate itself, but the problem states that the production rate is 100 widgets per hour, and every 10th widget is defective. So, the production rate remains constant; only the quality is affected.\n\nTherefore, the calculation remains valid.\n\nSo, the final answer is 720 non-defective widgets produced in an 8-hour workday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720} \\]"
