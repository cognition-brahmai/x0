        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 floors in the building, and on each floor, there are 4 apartments. Each apartment has 3 rooms, and in each room, there are 2 beds. I need to find out how many beds are on the third floor.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many apartments are on the third floor. Since each floor has 4 apartments, the third floor also has 4 apartments.\n\nNext, each apartment has 3 rooms. So, for the third floor, the total number of rooms would be the number of apartments multiplied by the number of rooms per apartment. That would be 4 apartments times 3 rooms per apartment, which equals 12 rooms.\n\nNow, each room has 2 beds. Therefore, the total number of beds on the third floor would be the total number of rooms multiplied by the number of beds per room. That's 12 rooms times 2 beds per room, which equals 24 beds.\n\nSo, there are 24 beds on the third floor.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to calculate this.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how many beds are in one apartment and then multiply that by the number of apartments on the third floor.\n\nEach apartment has 3 rooms, and each room has 2 beds, so each apartment has 3 times 2, which is 6 beds.\n\nSince there are 4 apartments on the third floor, the total number of beds would be 4 apartments times 6 beds per apartment, which again equals 24 beds.\n\nHmm, that matches my first calculation. So, I think 24 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the entire building.\n\nIf there are 5 floors, each with 4 apartments, that's 20 apartments in total.\n\nEach apartment has 6 beds, so the whole building has 20 times 6, which is 120 beds.\n\nBut the question is only about the third floor, which is one-fifth of the building since there are 5 floors.\n\nOne-fifth of 120 beds is 24 beds, which again confirms my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of rooms for the entire building, there are 20 apartments times 3 rooms per apartment, which is 60 rooms.\n\nWith 2 beds per room, that's 120 beds in total.\n\nAgain, one-fifth of that is 24 beds for the third floor.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. The answer should be 24 beds on the third floor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
