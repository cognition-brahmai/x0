        "content": "The primary scientific field that studies extraterrestrial rocks, including those brought back from the Moon by the Apollo astronauts, is planetary science. Within planetary science, a specific area called lunar science focuses exclusively on the Moon. Additionally, the study of meteorites and other space materials falls under the domain of astrogeology and cosmochemistry.\n\nPlanetary scientists analyze these samples to understand the Moon's composition, its geological history, and the processes that have shaped its surface over time. These studies have provided invaluable insights into the formation and evolution of the Earth-Moon system and the broader context of the solar system's history.\n\nFor example, the Apollo samples have been crucial in determining the age of the Moon and supporting the giant impact hypothesis, which suggests that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth approximately 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nMoreover, the study of lunar rocks has helped scientists understand the history of solar radiation and the effects of space weathering on planetary surfaces. It has also provided a basis for comparing the Moon's geology with that of Earth and other terrestrial planets.\n\nIn summary, planetary science, particularly lunar science, is the field that primarily studies the extraterrestrial rocks brought back from the Moon by the Apollo astronauts."
