        "content": "So the library has 500 books in total. Out of these, 60% are fiction books. I need to find out how many non-fiction books there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many fiction books there are. Since 60% of the books are fiction, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 500.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 500, I can multiply 500 by 0.60 (because 60% is the same as 0.60 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 500 times 0.60 is 300. That means there are 300 fiction books.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-fiction books, I need to subtract the number of fiction books from the total number of books.\n\nSo, 500 minus 300 equals 200.\n\nTherefore, there are 200 non-fiction books in the library.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of non-fiction books.\n\nIf 60% of the books are fiction, then the remaining percentage must be non-fiction. Since 100% is the total, subtracting 60% gives me 40%.\n\nSo, non-fiction books make up 40% of the total books.\n\nThen, I can calculate 40% of 500 to find the number of non-fiction books.\n\n40% of 500 is 0.40 times 500, which is also 200.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 200 non-fiction books.\n\nIt's good to see that both approaches confirm the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can check if 300 fiction books and 200 non-fiction books add up to the total number of books.\n\n300 plus 200 is indeed 500, which matches the total number given.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the library has 200 non-fiction books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
