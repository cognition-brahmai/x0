        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we have a publishing company that sells two types of books: hardcovers and paperbacks. The hardcovers are sold at $25 each with a production cost of $10, and paperbacks are sold at $15 each with a production cost of $5. The company sells a total of 100,000 books per month, with a 60-40 split between hardcovers and paperbacks. Our task is to calculate the current profit margin for each type of book and then determine how much the prices need to change to increase overall profits by 10% without affecting the sales volume.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many hardcovers and paperbacks are sold each month.\n\nTotal books sold = 100,000\n\nHardcovers percentage = 60%\n\nPaperbacks percentage = 40%\n\nNumber of hardcovers sold = 60% of 100,000 = 0.60 * 100,000 = 60,000\n\nNumber of paperbacks sold = 40% of 100,000 = 0.40 * 100,000 = 40,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the revenue from each type of book.\n\nRevenue from hardcovers = number of hardcovers sold * price per hardcover = 60,000 * $25 = $1,500,000\n\nRevenue from paperbacks = number of paperbacks sold * price per paperback = 40,000 * $15 = $600,000\n\nTotal revenue = revenue from hardcovers + revenue from paperbacks = $1,500,000 + $600,000 = $2,100,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of producing each type of book.\n\nCost for hardcovers = number of hardcovers sold * production cost per hardcover = 60,000 * $10 = $600,000\n\nCost for paperbacks = number of paperbacks sold * production cost per paperback = 40,000 * $5 = $200,000\n\nTotal cost = cost for hardcovers + cost for paperbacks = $600,000 + $200,000 = $800,000\n\nNow, we can find the current profit.\n\nProfit = total revenue - total cost = $2,100,000 - $800,000 = $1,300,000\n\nTo find the profit margin for each type of book, we need to calculate the profit per unit and then divide it by the selling price per unit.\n\nProfit per hardcover = selling price per hardcover - production cost per hardcover = $25 - $10 = $15\n\nProfit margin for hardcovers = (profit per hardcover / selling price per hardcover) * 100 = ($15 / $25) * 100 = 60%\n\nProfit per paperback = selling price per paperback - production cost per paperback = $15 - $5 = $10\n\nProfit margin for paperbacks = (profit per paperback / selling price per paperback) * 100 = ($10 / $15) * 100 \u2248 66.67%\n\nSo, the current profit margins are 60% for hardcovers and approximately 66.67% for paperbacks.\n\nNow, the company wants to increase overall profits by 10% without affecting sales volume. Let's find out what the new total profit should be.\n\nDesired profit increase = 10% of current profit = 0.10 * $1,300,000 = $130,000\n\nNew total profit = current profit + desired profit increase = $1,300,000 + $130,000 = $1,430,000\n\nSince sales volume remains the same, the only way to increase profit is by increasing the revenue, which can be done by raising the prices of the books.\n\nLet's denote the new price for hardcovers as P_h and for paperbacks as P_p.\n\nThe new revenue will be:\n\nNew revenue from hardcovers = 60,000 * P_h\n\nNew revenue from paperbacks = 40,000 * P_p\n\nTotal new revenue = 60,000 * P_h + 40,000 * P_p\n\nThe total cost remains the same since production costs don't change:\n\nTotal cost = $800,000\n\nThe new profit is:\n\nNew profit = total new revenue - total cost = 60,000 * P_h + 40,000 * P_p - $800,000\n\nWe want the new profit to be $1,430,000:\n\n60,000 * P_h + 40,000 * P_p - $800,000 = $1,430,000\n\n60,000 * P_h + 40,000 * P_p = $1,430,000 + $800,000 = $2,230,000\n\nSo, 60,000 * P_h + 40,000 * P_p = $2,230,000\n\nWe have one equation with two variables, which means there are multiple solutions. To find specific values for P_h and P_p, we need another equation or condition.\n\nOne approach is to assume that the price change for both types of books is proportional to their current prices. This means that the percentage increase in price is the same for both hardcovers and paperbacks.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the percentage increase in price as x.\n\nThen, the new prices would be:\n\nP_h = $25 * (1 + x)\n\nP_p = $15 * (1 + x)\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n\n60,000 * [25 * (1 + x)] + 40,000 * [15 * (1 + x)] = $2,230,000\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n60,000 * 25 * (1 + x) + 40,000 * 15 * (1 + x) = $2,230,000\n\n1,500,000 * (1 + x) + 600,000 * (1 + x) = $2,230,000\n\n(1,500,000 + 600,000) * (1 + x) = $2,230,000\n\n2,100,000 * (1 + x) = $2,230,000\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n1 + x = $2,230,000 / $2,100,000\n\n1 + x \u2248 1.0619\n\nx \u2248 0.0619 or 6.19%\n\nTherefore, to achieve a 10% increase in overall profit, the company needs to increase the prices of both hardcovers and paperbacks by approximately 6.19%.\n\nLet's calculate the new prices:\n\nNew price for hardcovers = $25 * 1.0619 \u2248 $26.55\n\nNew price for paperbacks = $15 * 1.0619 \u2248 $15.93\n\nTo confirm, let's calculate the new revenue and profit with these prices.\n\nNew revenue from hardcovers = 60,000 * $26.55 \u2248 $1,593,000\n\nNew revenue from paperbacks = 40,000 * $15.93 \u2248 $637,200\n\nTotal new revenue \u2248 $1,593,000 + $637,200 = $2,230,200\n\nNew profit \u2248 $2,230,200 - $800,000 = $1,430,200\n\nThe desired new profit was $1,430,000, so this checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if the company wants to differ the price changes between hardcovers and paperbacks, there are other combinations of P_h and P_p that satisfy the equation 60,000 * P_h + 40,000 * P_p = $2,230,000.\n\nFor example, if the company decides to increase the price of hardcovers by a higher percentage, the increase for paperbacks could be smaller, and vice versa.\n\nBut assuming equal percentage increases simplifies the approach and might be more practical in real-world scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, to achieve a 10% increase in overall profits without changing sales volume, the company should increase the prices of both hardcovers and paperbacks by approximately 6.19%, resulting in new prices of around $26.55 for hardcovers and $15.93 for paperbacks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Increase prices by approximately } 6.19\\% \\text{ for both hardcovers and paperbacks.}} \\]"
