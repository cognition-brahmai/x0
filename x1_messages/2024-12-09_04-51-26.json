        "content": "So the company has a total annual budget of $12 million for salaries. Out of this, 60% is for management salaries and 40% is for employee salaries. I need to find out how much money is allocated for each group.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the amount for management salaries. Since it's 60% of $12 million, I can find that by multiplying 12 million by 60%.\n\nSimilarly, for employee salaries, it's 40% of $12 million, so I'll multiply 12 million by 40%.\n\nLet me do the math for management salaries:\n\n60% of $12 million is 0.60 times 12,000,000.\n\n0.60 * 12,000,000 = 7,200,000.\n\nSo, $7,200,000 is allocated for management salaries.\n\nNow, for employee salaries:\n\n40% of $12 million is 0.40 times 12,000,000.\n\n0.40 * 12,000,000 = 4,800,000.\n\nTherefore, $4,800,000 is allocated for employee salaries.\n\nTo double-check, I'll add both amounts to ensure they total $12 million.\n\n7,200,000 + 4,800,000 = 12,000,000.\n\nYes, that matches the total budget.\n\nSo, to summarize, $7,200,000 is allocated for management salaries and $4,800,000 for employee salaries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Management: } \\$7,200,000, \\text{ Employees: } \\$4,800,000} \\]\n"
