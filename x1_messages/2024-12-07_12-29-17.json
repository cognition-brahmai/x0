If you prefer only the poem without the title and note, here it is:\n\nIn the east, a golden promise,  \nSky blushes, night's embrace releases.  \nSilhouettes awaken, shadows recede,  \nDawn's kisses paint the world with grace.  \n\nBirds sing hymns to the rising sun,  \nMorning mists dance, then are done.  \nLife stirs, fresh, renewed, and bright,  \nSunrise's magic, a daily delight."
