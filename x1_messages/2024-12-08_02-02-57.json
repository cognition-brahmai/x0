        "content": "Oh, that's an interesting question! So, Tiger Balm is a popular ointment used for muscle relief, and it contains a few key ingredients like menthol and camphor. Now, you mentioned that it also has a spicy oil derived from capsicum plants. Let me think about this.\n\nCapsicum plants are known for producing chili peppers, right? And the spicy component in chili peppers is capsaicin. So, I'm guessing that the spicy oil in Tiger Balm is capsaicin oil. Capsaicin is known for its pain-relieving properties, which would make sense in a muscle relief ointment.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Tiger Balm's exact formula is a secret, but according to their official website and various sources, the main ingredients are indeed menthol, camphor, and what they call \"special oil,\" which is likely to be a blend including capsaicin from capsicum plants.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the spicy oil derived from capsicum plants in Tiger Balm is probably capsaicin oil.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{capsaicin oil}} \\]"
