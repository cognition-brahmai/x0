        "content": "Let's see. We have four friends: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David. We need to figure out who's the youngest based on some age comparisons.\n\nFirst, it says that Alice is older than Bob but younger than Charlie. So, compared to Bob and Charlie, Alice is in between. That means Charlie is older than Alice, and Alice is older than Bob.\n\nSo, in terms of age:\n\nCharlie > Alice > Bob\n\nNext, it says that David is younger than Alice but older than Bob. So, David is between Alice and Bob in age.\n\nSo, adding David into the mix:\n\nCharlie > Alice > David > Bob\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nWe know:\n\n1. Alice is older than Bob.\n\n2. Alice is younger than Charlie.\n\n3. David is younger than Alice.\n\n4. David is older than Bob.\n\nSo, from these points:\n\n- Charlie is older than Alice.\n\n- Alice is older than David.\n\n- David is older than Bob.\n\nTherefore, the order from oldest to youngest is:\n\nCharlie > Alice > David > Bob\n\nSo, Bob is the youngest among the four friends.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no other possible interpretations. Is there any way that Bob isn't the youngest?\n\nIf we look at the relationships again:\n\n- Alice > Bob\n\n- Charlie > Alice\n\n- Alice > David\n\n- David > Bob\n\nSo, everyone is older than Bob, which means Bob is the youngest.\n\nAlternatively, if we try to arrange their ages in a different way, say, suppose David is younger than Bob, but according to the statement, David is older than Bob, which contradicts. So, no, David is definitely older than Bob.\n\nTherefore, Bob is the youngest.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bob}} \\]"
