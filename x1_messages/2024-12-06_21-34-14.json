        "content": "Mural painting was a major art form during the Roman Empire, specifically from 27 BC to 476 AD, which is known as the Imperial Roman period. During this time, frescoes were widely used to decorate the walls of homes, villas, and public buildings. These murals often depicted a variety of subjects, including mythology, daily life, landscapes, and portraits. The most famous examples of Roman murals can be found in Pompeii and Herculaneum, which were preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The styles of Roman mural painting evolved over time and are categorized into four styles: Incrustation, Architectural, Ornate, and Invention."
