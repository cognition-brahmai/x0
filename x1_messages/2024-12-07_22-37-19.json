        "content": "So there are 10 people at this party, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think about just a smaller group to understand the pattern. Suppose there are 2 people at the party. Person A and Person B. They would shake hands once. So, with 2 people, there's 1 handshake.\n\nNow, if there are 3 people: Person A, B, and C. A shakes hands with B, A shakes hands with C, and B shakes hands with C. That's 3 handshakes.\n\nWith 4 people: A, B, C, and D. A shakes hands with B, C, and D (that's 3 handshakes). B already shook hands with A, so B shakes hands with C and D (2 more handshakes). C already shook hands with A and B, so C shakes hands with D (1 more handshake). Total is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, I see a pattern here. With 2 people, 1 handshake. 3 people, 3 handshakes. 4 people, 6 handshakes. It seems like with each additional person, you add one less handshake than the previous addition. Like, from 2 to 3 people, you add 2 handshakes (3 - 1 = 2). From 3 to 4 people, you add 3 handshakes (6 - 3 = 3).\n\nSo, if this pattern continues, with 5 people, it should be 6 (from 4 people) plus 4, which is 10 handshakes. Then, 6 people would be 10 + 5 = 15, and so on.\n\nBut I need a general way to calculate this for any number of people, not just up to 10. Let's say there are n people at the party. How many handshakes are there?\n\nEach person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for each person, they shake hands with (n - 1) other people. But wait, if I multiply n by (n - 1), that would count each handshake twice because when A shakes hands with B, it's the same as B shaking hands with A.\n\nSo, to get the correct total, I need to divide that by 2. Therefore, the total number of handshakes should be [n * (n - 1)] / 2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier examples.\n\nFor n = 2: [2 * 1] / 2 = 1. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3: [3 * 2] / 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nFor n = 4: [4 * 3] / 2 = 6. Correct.\n\nFor n = 5: [5 * 4] / 2 = 10. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, applying this to the original problem with 10 people: [10 * 9] / 2 = 45 handshakes.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using combinations. Specifically, choosing 2 people out of n to shake hands. The number of ways to choose 2 people from n is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!), which simplifies to [n * (n - 1)] / 2, which is the same formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, using either approach, I get 45 handshakes for 10 people.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider a different approach. Suppose I list out all possible handshakes.\n\nPerson A shakes hands with B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (that's 9 handshakes).\n\nPerson B has already shaken hands with A, so they shake hands with C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (8 handshakes).\n\nPerson C has already shaken hands with A and B, so they shake hands with D, E, F, G, H, I, J (7 handshakes).\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nPerson D: 6 handshakes\n\nPerson E: 5 handshakes\n\nPerson F: 4 handshakes\n\nPerson G: 3 handshakes\n\nPerson H: 2 handshakes\n\nPerson I: 1 handshake\n\nPerson J: 0 handshakes (since they've already shaken hands with everyone else)\n\nNow, adding these up: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 45 handshakes.\n\nThis matches the result from the formula, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the sum of the first (n - 1) natural numbers, which is another way to look at it. For n = 10, sum of first 9 natural numbers is [9 * 10] / 2 = 45, which again confirms the answer.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes at the party is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
