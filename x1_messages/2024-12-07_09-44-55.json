Physical activity has been posited as a potential intervention to mitigate age-related cognitive decline. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between daily physical activity levels and cognitive function in older adults.\n\n**Methodology:** A total of 200 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and above participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited from local senior centers and through community advertisements. Inclusion criteria included being aged 65 or older, able to speak English, and without any severe cognitive impairments or physical disabilities that would prevent participation in physical activities.\n\n**Measures:** Physical activity levels were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), which categorizes participants into low, moderate, and high activity levels based on their reported daily activities. Cognitive function was evaluated using a battery of tests including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for global cognition, the Trail Making Test (TMT) for executive function, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) for memory.\n\n**Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationships between physical activity levels and cognitive test scores. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the predictive value of physical activity on cognitive function, controlling for potential confounders such as age, education level, and health status.\n\n**Results:** The sample consisted of 120 women and 80 men with a mean age of 72.5 years (SD = 5.6). Participants were categorized as follows: 60 with low physical activity, 80 with moderate activity, and 60 with high activity levels. There was a significant positive correlation between physical activity levels and MMSE scores (r = 0.45, p < 0.001), TMT part B scores (r = -0.35, p < 0.001), and RAVLT immediate recall scores (r = 0.30, p = 0.002). Regression analysis revealed that physical activity level was a significant predictor of cognitive function, explaining approximately 20% of the variance in global cognition, after adjusting for age, education, and health status.\n\n**Conclusion:** This study provides evidence for a positive association between daily physical activity and cognitive function in older adults. Engaging in regular physical activity may help maintain and improve cognitive abilities in later life. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.\n\n**Keywords:** Physical activity, cognitive function, older adults, cross-sectional study, MMSE, TMT, RAVLT"
