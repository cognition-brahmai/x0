        "content": "I believe the musical instrument you're referring to is the theremin. It was invented by Russian inventor Leon Theremin in the early 20th century, around 1920. The theremin is unique because it's played without any physical contact. The musician controls the pitch and volume by moving their hands in the air around two antennas. The instrument generates an eerie, otherworldly sound, which has made it a popular choice in science fiction and horror film soundtracks. Notable composers like Bernard Herrmann and Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa incorporated the theremin into their scores to create suspenseful and atmospheric music."
