        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to find out how much the person spent on apples and oranges separately, and then figure out what percentage of the total spending was on apples.\n\nSo, the store sells apples for $1.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. The person buys 4 apples and 6 oranges.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total cost of the apples:\n\nCost of apples = number of apples \u00d7 price per apple\n\nCost of apples = 4 \u00d7 $1.50\n\nNow, 4 times 1.50 is:\n\n4 \u00d7 1.50 = 6.00\n\nSo, the person spent $6.00 on apples.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost of the oranges:\n\nCost of oranges = number of oranges \u00d7 price per orange\n\nCost of oranges = 6 \u00d7 $0.75\n\n6 times 0.75 is:\n\n6 \u00d7 0.75 = 4.50\n\nSo, the person spent $4.50 on oranges.\n\nNow, I need to find the total spending on both apples and oranges:\n\nTotal spending = cost of apples + cost of oranges\n\nTotal spending = $6.00 + $4.50 = $10.50\n\nAlright, now I need to find out what percentage of this total spending was on apples.\n\nTo find the percentage, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (part / whole) \u00d7 100%\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the spending on apples, and the \"whole\" is the total spending.\n\nSo:\n\nPercentage on apples = (cost of apples / total spending) \u00d7 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage on apples = ($6.00 / $10.50) \u00d7 100%\n\nFirst, I'll divide 6.00 by 10.50:\n\n6.00 \u00f7 10.50 \u2248 0.5714\n\nThen, multiply by 100% to get the percentage:\n\n0.5714 \u00d7 100% \u2248 57.14%\n\nSo, approximately 57.14% of the total spending was on apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that division to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n6.00 divided by 10.50:\n\n10.50 goes into 6.00 zero times, so 0.\n\nWait, actually, 10.50 goes into 60.0 zero times, but that doesn't make sense. Let's try moving the decimal point.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 600 divided by 1050, which might be easier.\n\n600 \u00f7 1050:\n\nBoth numerator and denominator can be divided by 150.\n\n600 \u00f7 150 = 4\n\n1050 \u00f7 150 = 7\n\nSo, 600 \u00f7 1050 = 4 \u00f7 7 \u2248 0.5714\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is indeed approximately 57.14%.\n\nI should probably round it to two decimal places, so 57.14%.\n\nAlternatively, if the context requires more precision, I could keep more decimal places, but for most purposes, 57.14% is fine.\n\nLet me just confirm the calculations once more to be sure.\n\nCost of apples: 4 \u00d7 1.50 = 6.00\n\nCost of oranges: 6 \u00d7 0.75 = 4.50\n\nTotal spending: 6.00 + 4.50 = 10.50\n\nPercentage on apples: (6.00 / 10.50) \u00d7 100% = 57.14%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to simplify the fraction before multiplying by 100%.\n\n6.00 / 10.50 = 6 / 10.5\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10:\n\n(6 \u00d7 10) / (10.5 \u00d7 10) = 60 / 105\n\nNow, simplify 60/105 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n60 \u00f7 15 = 4\n\n105 \u00f7 15 = 7\n\nSo, 4/7\n\nNow, 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714\n\nThen, 0.5714 \u00d7 100% = 57.14%\n\nSame result again.\n\nI think it's solid.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 57.14%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{57.14\\%} \\]"
