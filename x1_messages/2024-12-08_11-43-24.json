        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a group of people going to an amusement park and riding roller coasters. They try to split into groups of 4, and there are 3 people left without a group. When they split into groups of 5, there are 2 people left. I need to find the smallest possible number of people in the group.\n\nOkay, so let's translate this into mathematical terms. If they split into groups of 4 and have 3 left over, that means the total number of people, let's call it N, when divided by 4, leaves a remainder of 3. Similarly, when divided by 5, it leaves a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, in congruence notation, that would be:\n\nN \u2261 3 mod 4\n\nN \u2261 2 mod 5\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integer N that satisfies both of these congruences.\n\nAlright, one way to approach this is to list multiples that satisfy each congruence and see where they overlap.\n\nFirst, let's list numbers that satisfy N \u2261 3 mod 4:\n\nThese would be numbers like 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 83, 87, 91, 95, 99, and so on.\n\nNow, let's list numbers that satisfy N \u2261 2 mod 5:\n\nThese would be numbers like 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67, 72, 77, 82, 87, 92, 97, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to find the common numbers in both lists. Looking at the first list:\n\n3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 83, 87, 91, 95, 99,...\n\nAnd the second list:\n\n2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67, 72, 77, 82, 87, 92, 97,...\n\nLooking for common numbers, I see 7, 27, 47, 67, 87,...\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer here is 7. Let me check if that works.\n\nIf N = 7:\n\n7 divided by 4 is 1 group with 3 left over, since 4*1 = 4, and 7 - 4 = 3.\n\n7 divided by 5 is 1 group with 2 left over, since 5*1 = 5, and 7 - 5 = 2.\n\nPerfect, it satisfies both conditions.\n\nIs there a smaller positive integer that works? Let's check the next smallest number, which would be 7 minus some multiple of the least common multiple of 4 and 5.\n\nWait, no. Since we're dealing with congruences, the general solution would be N = 7 + k*(LCM of 4 and 5), where k is an integer.\n\nThe LCM of 4 and 5 is 20. So, N = 7 + 20k.\n\nSo, possible values of N are 7, 27, 47, 67, 87, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies both congruences is 7.\n\nAlternatively, I could have solved this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but since the moduli are small, listing multiples was straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
