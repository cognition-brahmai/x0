        "content": "That sounds like a really interesting question! So, you're asking about an iconic American landmark that was completed in 1884 and was once the tallest building in the world until it was surpassed by the Eiffel Tower. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nI know that the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889, so the American landmark must have been the tallest building until then. I'm trying to recall which structure that could be. Was it the Statue of Liberty? No, the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886, which is after 1884, so that probably doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it was one of the tall buildings in New York City? I know that the race for the tallest building was really competitive back then. Was there a specific building that held that title around that time?\n\nLet me see, I think the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, completed in 1885, is considered one of the first skyscrapers, but that's after 1884. So maybe not that one.\n\nWait, what about the Washington Monument? It was completed in 1884, right? And it is an iconic American landmark. Let me check its height. I believe it's about 555 feet tall. Now, comparing that to the Eiffel Tower, which is 984 feet tall, so yes, the Eiffel Tower is taller.\n\nBut was the Washington Monument the tallest structure at the time of its completion in 1884? I think it was the tallest building in the United States at that time, but was it the tallest in the world?\n\nI recall that the Cologne Cathedral in Germany was completed in 1880 and is about 515 feet tall, so the Washington Monument would have been taller than that. Were there any other structures around that time that were taller?\n\nAlso, I know that the Great Pyramid of Giza was taller, but that was built thousands of years earlier. So, in the modern era, was the Washington Monument the tallest structure?\n\nWait, I think there were some church spires and other structures that might have been taller. For example, the Strasbourg Cathedral in France is about 466 feet tall, completed in 1439, so older than 1884.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look into this a bit more. Perhaps the Washington Monument was the tallest stone structure at the time, but was it the tallest overall?\n\nLet me consider another possibility: the Philadelphia City Hall. It was completed in 1901, so that's after 1884. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWhat about the Chrysler Building? Oh, that's much later, in the 1930s. Not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's one of the tall buildings in Chicago or New York before 1884. For example, the Tower Building in New York, completed in 1889, but that's after 1884.\n\nLet me try to recall the tallest buildings around that time. I think the Tall Office Buildings Act, or something similar, started to influence architecture in the late 19th century.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not a building but a structure like a bridge or something else.\n\nWait, the Brooklyn Bridge was completed in 1883, which is before 1884. But I don't think it was the tallest structure; its main span is about 1,595 feet, but in terms of height, its towers are about 276 feet high, which is less than the Washington Monument.\n\nSo, perhaps the Washington Monument was indeed the tallest structure in the world upon its completion in 1884.\n\nBut I need to confirm that. Let me think about other structures around the world at that time.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the tallest structure was the Cologne Cathedral, but as I mentioned, it was completed in 1880 and is shorter than the Washington Monument.\n\nThen, in 1889, the Eiffel Tower was built and became the tallest structure in the world at that time.\n\nSo, between 1884 and 1889, was there any structure that surpassed the Washington Monument?\n\nI don't think so. The Eiffel Tower was built specifically to be the tallest structure for the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the Washington Monument was the tallest building in the world from its completion in 1884 until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889.\n\nBut to be precise, I should check if there were any other structures built between 1884 and 1889 that might have been taller.\n\nFor example, the Tower of Chaumont, a part of the Mont Blanc Tunnel, was started in the late 19th century, but I'm not sure about its completion date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there were some church spires or other tall structures in Europe that might have been taller.\n\nBut based on my knowledge, the Washington Monument held the title of the tallest structure from 1884 to 1889.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the iconic American landmark completed in 1884 that was once the tallest building in the world until surpassed by the Eiffel Tower is the Washington Monument.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Washington Monument}} \\]"
