        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. That means in total, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 balls in the box.\n\nThe problem says I pick one ball, replace it, and then pick another ball. I need to find the probability that both balls are red.\n\nOkay, first things first. Since I'm replacing the ball after the first pick, that means the total number of balls remains the same for both picks. So, each pick is independent of the other.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a red ball on the first pick. There are 4 red balls out of 9 total balls, so the probability is 4/9.\n\nSince I'm replacing it, the second pick also has 4 red balls out of 9 total balls, so the probability is again 4/9.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening\u2014both picks being red\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, (4/9) * (4/9) = 16/81.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to pick a red ball on the first pick is 4, and since I replace it, the number of ways to pick a red ball on the second pick is also 4. The total number of possible outcomes for each pick is 9.\n\nSo, the probability is (number of favorable outcomes)/(total possible outcomes) for both picks.\n\nSince picks are independent, multiplying the probabilities makes sense.\n\nSo, yes, 16/81 should be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it another way.\n\nThe probability of picking two red balls in a row with replacement should indeed be (4/9) * (4/9) = 16/81.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the picks as a sequence, the probability of picking red on the first pick is 4/9, and red on the second pick is also 4/9, so multiplying them gives 16/81.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: the probability of picking a red ball each time is 4/9, and since the picks are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, again, 16/81.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can calculate the probability step by step.\n\nFirst pick: red ball, probability 4/9.\n\nSince I replace it, the conditions for the second pick are the same.\n\nSecond pick: red ball, probability 4/9.\n\nMultiply them: 4/9 * 4/9 = 16/81.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total number of possible outcomes for two picks with replacement, it would be 9 * 9 = 81, since each pick has 9 possible outcomes.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick a red ball on the first pick and a red ball on the second pick.\n\nSince there are 4 red balls each time, it's 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nSo, the probability is 16/81.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any dependency between the picks? No, because I'm replacing the ball each time.\n\nAre there any constraints or conditions I need to consider? The problem states that it's with replacement, so the picks are independent.\n\nIs there a possibility that the balls are not equally likely to be picked? The problem doesn't suggest any bias, so I can assume that each ball is equally likely to be picked.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there's any other factor to consider.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is 16/81.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{16}{81}} \\]"
