The Danube originates in the Black Forest region of Germany and travels eastward, passing through or bordering Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, finally discharging into the Black Sea. The four capital cities it passes through are Vienna (Austria), Bratislava (Slovakia), Budapest (Hungary), and Belgrade (Serbia). The Danube is significant not only for its geographical extent but also for its role in history, culture, and commerce in Europe."
