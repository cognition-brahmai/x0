        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a group of friends renting a beach house that costs $2100 for a week, and each friend is supposed to contribute an equal amount of $150. The question is, how many friends are in the group?\n\nWell, this seems like a straightforward division problem. If the total cost is $2100 and each person pays $150, then the number of friends should be the total cost divided by the individual contribution. So, I'll take 2100 divided by 150.\n\nLet me do the math here. 150 times 14 is 2100, right? Let me check that. 150 multiplied by 10 is 1500, and 150 multiplied by 4 is 600. Adding those together, 1500 plus 600 equals 2100. So, 14 friends would cover the entire cost if each pays $150.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there's a formula or a different approach I should consider.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of sharing the cost equally. If the total cost is $2100 and each person pays $150, then the number of people should be 2100 divided by 150, which is indeed 14.\n\nAnother way to verify this is to multiply the number of friends by the amount each pays to see if it equals the total cost. So, 14 friends times $150 each equals $2100. That matches the total rental fee, so it seems correct.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the cost, like additional fees or taxes, but the problem doesn't mention any extras beyond the rental fee. So, I'll assume that the $2100 is the sole cost to be split among the friends.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the division is exact, with no remainder. Dividing 2100 by 150 gives 14 with no remainder, which makes sense because the problem states that each person contributes an equal amount. If there were a remainder, that would mean either the cost isn't fully covered or some people have to pay extra, which isn't the case here.\n\nLet me consider if there's a possibility of a mistake in my calculation. Maybe I should try dividing 2100 by 150 again. 150 times 10 is 1500, subtract that from 2100 leaves 600. Then, 150 times 4 is 600, which adds up to 2100. So, 10 plus 4 equals 14. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of units. If each unit is $150, then $2100 would be 2100 divided by 150 units, which again is 14 units. So, 14 friends.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 14 friends in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
