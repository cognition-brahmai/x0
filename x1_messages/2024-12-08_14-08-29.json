        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Bash script that renames all files in a directory by adding a timestamp prefix, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Get the current timestamp**: We'll generate a timestamp in a specific format that we can use as a prefix for the filenames.\n\n2. **List all files in the directory**: We'll need to iterate through each file in the specified directory.\n\n3. **Rename each file**: For each file, we'll prepend the timestamp to its name.\n\nLet's break this down and write the script step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Get the current timestamp\n\nWe can use the `date` command to get the current timestamp. For example, to get a timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`, we can use:\n\n```bash\ntimestamp=$(date +%F_%T)\n```\n\nThis will set `timestamp` to something like `2023-04-01_12:34:56`.\n\n### Step 2: List all files in the directory\n\nWe can use a loop to iterate through all files in the current directory. For example:\n\n```bash\nfor file in *; do\n    # Rename logic will go here\ndone\n```\n\nThis loop will iterate over each file and directory in the current directory. We might want to exclude specific files or directories, but for now, we'll keep it simple.\n\n### Step 3: Rename each file\n\nInside the loop, we'll rename each file by adding the timestamp prefix. We can use the `mv` command for this. For example:\n\n```bash\nmv \"$file\" \"${timestamp}_${file}\"\n```\n\nThis will rename `example.txt` to `2023-04-01_12:34:56_example.txt`.\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nHere's the complete script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Get the current timestamp\ntimestamp=$(date +%F_%T)\n\n# Iterate through all files in the directory\nfor file in *; do\n    # Skip directories\n    if [ -d \"$file\" ]; then\n        continue\n    fi\n    # Rename the file with timestamp prefix\n    mv \"$file\" \"${timestamp}_${file}\"\ndone\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**: This tells the system that this script should be run using Bash.\n\n2. **Timestamp**: We generate a timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`.\n\n3. **Loop through files**: We loop through all items in the current directory.\n\n4. **Skip directories**: We check if the item is a directory using `[ -d \"$file\" ]` and skip it if true.\n\n5. **Rename files**: We rename each file by prepending the timestamp using `mv`.\n\n### Running the script\n\n1. **Save the script**: Save the script to a file, for example, `add_timestamp.sh`.\n\n2. **Make it executable**: Run `chmod +x add_timestamp.sh`.\n\n3. **Run the script**: Navigate to the directory containing the files you want to rename and run `./add_timestamp.sh`.\n\nThis script will add a timestamp prefix to all files in the current directory, excluding directories themselves.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further customization, feel free to ask!"
