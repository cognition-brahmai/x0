        "content": "Upon the velvet curtain of the night,\nWhere heaven's tapestry is spread so bright,\nDoth scatter stars in their celestial might.\nEach one a beacon, shining with delight.\n\nTheir twinkling eyes, like diamonds in the sky,\nReflect the stories of eons gone by.\nIn their resplendent dance, we find a sigh\nOf wonder, as old as time's own sigh.\n\nThe moon, a queen, doth reign with gentle grace,\nHer silver light upon the starry space.\nYet stars, her subjects, in their orbits trace\nA path that none can tame or displace.\n\nOh, what a sight to see them all aglow,\nAs if the heavens have put on a show!\nEach star a world, or so they do bestow,\nTheir mysteries hidden, yet they do bestow\n\nA sense of peace, a calm that doth ensue,\nWhen mortal cares are lost in starry view.\nSo let us gaze, and in their light renew\nOur spirits, washed in cosmic blue.\n\nFor in their beauty, we find our own,\nA spark of divinity, unknown.\nSo let us praise the stars, one and alone,\nAnd in their radiance, make our own throne."
