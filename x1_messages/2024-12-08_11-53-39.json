        "content": "Let's see. There are 7 houses on the street, each with a different color door. The first house has a red door, the second has a blue door, and the third has a yellow door. I need to figure out what color the door of the last house is.\n\nFirst, I should note that there are seven houses in total, so the last house is the seventh one. The first three houses have doors of red, blue, and yellow respectively. Since each house has a different color door, none of the remaining four houses can have red, blue, or yellow doors.\n\nBut wait, the question doesn't specify what the colors of the fourth, fifth, and sixth houses are, only the first three. It just says that each house has a different color door. So, the colors of the doors from the fourth to the seventh houses must be different from each other and also different from red, blue, and yellow.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking for the color of the last house's door, which is the seventh house. But without information about the colors of the fourth, fifth, and sixth houses, it's impossible to determine the exact color of the seventh house's door.\n\nMaybe there's a pattern or a rule that I'm missing. Let's think about it differently. Perhaps the colors are assigned in a specific order or there's a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the colors are assigned in a way that each subsequent house has a door color that follows a certain sequence, like the colors of the rainbow or something similar.\n\nLet me list out the colors we know:\n\n1. Red\n\n2. Blue\n\n3. Yellow\n\n4. ?\n\n5. ?\n\n6. ?\n\n7. ?\n\nEach color is unique, so the fourth house must have a door color that's not red, blue, or yellow. Let's assume that the colors are being chosen from a set of, say, 10 different colors, but we don't know the complete set.\n\nSince the question doesn't provide any additional information about the colors of the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh houses, other than they are different from each other and from the first three, I don't think there's enough information to determine the exact color of the seventh house's door.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing whether I recognize that there isn't enough information to determine the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, and the last house has a door of a specific color that's different from the first three, but without more information, I can't be sure.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is implying that the doors are arranged in a specific order based on the colors of the first three houses. For example, if the first house is red, the second is blue, and the third is yellow, maybe there's a pattern or a sequence that continues up to the seventh house.\n\nHowever, without any indication of what that pattern might be, I can't make any assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the colors are being assigned in alphabetical order, but red, blue, and yellow aren't in alphabetical order.\n\nRed comes after blue in the alphabet, and yellow comes after both.\n\nWait, blue, red, yellow in alphabetical order. But the sequence given is red, blue, yellow, which isn't alphabetical.\n\nSo that doesn't seem to be the pattern.\n\nMaybe the colors are being selected based on their wavelengths, but again, red has a longer wavelength than blue and yellow.\n\nBut yellow has a shorter wavelength than red and longer than blue, so that doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the colors are being selected based on their positions in the RGB color model, but that might not apply here.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that each house has a different color door, and we know the colors of the first three houses. Without knowing the total set of colors available or the colors of the remaining houses, I can't determine the color of the seventh house's door.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there isn't enough information to determine the color of the last house's door.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Not enough information}} \\]"
