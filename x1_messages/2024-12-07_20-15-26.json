        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of candies: type A costs $2 each and type B costs $3 each. The customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends exactly $50. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of type A candies.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of type B candies.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candies is 20.\n\n2. The total cost is $50.\n\nWe can translate these into equations.\n\nFrom the first piece of information:\n\n\\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\nFrom the second piece of information:\n\n\\( 2x + 3y = 50 \\)\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 3y = 50 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - y \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 2(20 - y) + 3y = 50 \\)\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n\\( 40 - 2y + 3y = 50 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 40 + y = 50 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 40 from both sides:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nOkay, so there are 10 type B candies.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - 10 = 10 \\)\n\nSo, there are 10 type A candies and 10 type B candies.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this makes sense.\n\nIf you buy 10 type A candies at $2 each, that's \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) dollars.\n\nType B candies: 10 at $3 each, that's \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal spent: \\( 20 + 30 = 50 \\) dollars, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, total candies: \\( 10 + 10 = 20 \\), which also matches.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the elimination method.\n\nLet's try that to confirm.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 3y = 50 \\)\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 2:\n\n\\( 2x + 2y = 40 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n\\( (2x + 3y) - (2x + 2y) = 50 - 40 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nAgain, \\( y = 10 \\), and then \\( x = 20 - 10 = 10 \\).\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about this problem without algebra.\n\nLet's say all 20 candies are type A. That would cost \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\) dollars.\n\nBut the customer spent $50, which is $10 more than $40.\n\nEach type B candy costs $1 more than type A ($3 - $2 = $1).\n\nSo, to make up the extra $10, the customer must have bought 10 type B candies.\n\nTherefore, 10 type A and 10 type B candies.\n\nThis matches our algebraic solution.\n\nAlternatively, if all 20 candies were type B, that would cost \\( 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\) dollars.\n\nBut the customer only spent $50, which is $10 less than $60.\n\nEach type A candy saves $1 compared to type B ($3 - $2 = $1).\n\nSo, to save $10, the customer must have bought 10 type A candies.\n\nAgain, leading to 10 type A and 10 type B candies.\n\nAll methods point to the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 10 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ type A candies and } 10 \\text{ type B candies}} \\]"
