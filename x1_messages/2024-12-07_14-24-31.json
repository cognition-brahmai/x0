        "content": "So in this village, there are 10 houses, right? And each house has 5 rooms, and each room has 3 windows. If all the windows are broken, we need to find out how many windows need to be fixed.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, there are 10 houses. Each house has 5 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in the village would be the number of houses multiplied by the number of rooms per house. That would be 10 houses times 5 rooms, which is 50 rooms.\n\nNow, each room has 3 windows. So, to find the total number of windows in the village, we need to multiply the total number of rooms by the number of windows per room. That would be 50 rooms times 3 windows, which equals 150 windows.\n\nTherefore, if all the windows are broken, 150 windows would need to be fixed.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, maybe some windows are shared between rooms or something, but the problem says each room has 3 windows, and all windows are broken.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some houses have fewer rooms or something, but the problem says each house has 5 rooms, so they're all the same.\n\nSo, no, I think the calculation is correct. It's 10 houses, each with 5 rooms, each room with 3 windows, so 10 times 5 is 50, times 3 is 150 windows in total.\n\nTherefore, 150 windows need to be fixed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
