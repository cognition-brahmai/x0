        "content": "So, if you flip a coin twice, and you want to know the chances of getting two heads, right? Okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you flip a coin, there are two possible outcomes each time: heads or tails. And each flip is independent of the other, meaning the first flip doesn't affect the second flip.\n\nSo, for each flip, the probability of getting heads is 1/2, or 50%. Now, since the flips are independent, to find the probability of both events happening\u2014getting heads on the first flip and heads on the second flip\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nThat means, probability of two heads = probability of heads on first flip \u00d7 probability of heads on second flip.\n\nSo, that's 1/2 \u00d7 1/2, which equals 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the chances of getting two heads when flipping a coin twice is 1/4, or 25%.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it in terms of all possible outcomes. When you flip a coin twice, there are four possible outcomes:\n\n1. Heads on first flip and heads on second flip (HH)\n\n2. Heads on first flip and tails on second flip (HT)\n\n3. Tails on first flip and heads on second flip (TH)\n\n4. Tails on first flip and tails on second flip (TT)\n\nSo, there are four equally likely outcomes, and only one of them is HH. Therefore, the probability is 1 out of 4, which again is 1/4 or 25%.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the coin is not fair? Like, what if it\u2019s biased and the probability of heads is not 1/2? But the question doesn\u2019t say anything about the coin being unfair, so I think it\u2019s safe to assume it\u2019s a fair coin.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the flips are independent. Again, unless stated otherwise, we can assume that each flip is independent of the others.\n\nLet me consider if there\u2019s another way to look at this. Could I use the binomial probability formula? Yeah, for n trials and k successes, the probability is (n choose k) times p^k times (1-p)^(n-k).\n\nIn this case, n=2, k=2, and p=1/2.\n\nSo, binomial coefficient (2 choose 2) is 1, p^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, and (1-p)^(2-2) is 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 \u00d7 1/4 \u00d7 1 = 1/4.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier, so I\u2019m more confident now.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the sample space. The sample space for two coin flips is {HH, HT, TH, TT}, and each of these has an equal probability of 1/4.\n\nThe event we\u2019re interested in is getting two heads, which is just one outcome: HH. So, the probability is 1/4.\n\nI think that covers it. But to be thorough, maybe I can consider the probability of getting at least one head or something, but the question specifically asks for two heads in two flips.\n\nWait, does the order matter? Like, is it necessary to have heads on the first flip and heads on the second flip, or just two heads in any order?\n\nActually, since we\u2019re looking for two heads, the order doesn\u2019t matter because the only way to get two heads is if both flips are heads.\n\nBut if the question was about getting one head and one tail, then order would matter because there are two ways that can happen: HT or TH.\n\nIn this case, since we\u2019re looking for two heads, there\u2019s only one way: HH.\n\nSo, the probability remains 1/4.\n\nLet me see if there\u2019s any other angle to this.\n\nSuppose I consider the coins to be distinguishable or indistinguishable. If the coins are indistinguishable, then maybe the outcomes are different.\n\nWait, no. Even if the coins are indistinguishable, the outcomes are still HH, HT, TH, TT, with HT and TH being the same in terms of one head and one tail, but for two heads, it\u2019s still just HH.\n\nBut in probability theory, we typically consider the coins as distinguishable to avoid confusion, even if they are identical in reality.\n\nSo, I think sticking with the four equally likely outcomes is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability of getting heads on the second flip given that the first flip was heads.\n\nSince the flips are independent, the probability of heads on the second flip is still 1/2, regardless of the first flip.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both being heads is the probability of the first being heads (1/2) times the probability of the second being heads given the first was heads (1/2), which is again 1/4.\n\nThis reinforces my earlier conclusion.\n\nI think I\u2019ve covered all the bases here. The probability of getting two heads when flipping a coin twice is 1/4, or 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
