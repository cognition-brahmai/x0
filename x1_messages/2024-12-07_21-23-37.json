        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 25 people in a group: 15 with brown eyes, 7 with blue eyes, and 3 with green eyes. I need to find the probability that if I randomly select 3 people from this group, they all have different eye colors. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of ways to select 3 people out of 25. Since the order doesn't matter here, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 people out of 25 is C(25, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(25, 3) = 25! / (3!(25 - 3)!) = (25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23) / 6.\n\nLet's compute that: 25 \u00d7 24 = 600, 600 \u00d7 23 = 13,800, and 13,800 divided by 6 is 2,300. So, there are 2,300 possible groups of 3 people.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of groups where all three have different eye colors: one with brown, one with blue, and one with green.\n\nGiven that there are 15 brown-eyed, 7 blue-eyed, and 3 green-eyed people, the number of ways to choose one from each group is the product of the individual choices:\n\nNumber of ways = 15 (brown) \u00d7 7 (blue) \u00d7 3 (green) = 15 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet's calculate that: 15 \u00d7 7 = 105, and 105 \u00d7 3 = 315.\n\nSo, there are 315 groups where each person has a different eye color.\n\nTo find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 315 / 2,300.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both 315 and 2,300 can be divided by 5:\n\n315 \u00f7 5 = 63, and 2,300 \u00f7 5 = 460. So, it's 63/460.\n\nIs this the final answer? Wait, maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the selection step by step, considering the probabilities at each stage.\n\nFirst, the probability of selecting a brown-eyed person first is 15/25.\n\nThen, given that the first person selected was brown-eyed, the probability of selecting a blue-eyed person next is 7/24.\n\nFinally, given that the first two were brown and blue, the probability of selecting a green-eyed person next is 3/23.\n\nSo, the probability would be (15/25) \u00d7 (7/24) \u00d7 (3/23).\n\nBut wait, this assumes a specific order: brown first, then blue, then green. However, the order in which we select the people doesn't matter, as long as we end up with one of each eye color.\n\nTherefore, I need to account for all the possible orders in which we can select one of each eye color.\n\nThe number of different orders is the number of permutations of three distinct items, which is 3! = 6.\n\nSo, the total probability would be 6 \u00d7 (15/25) \u00d7 (7/24) \u00d7 (3/23).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, (15/25) \u00d7 (7/24) \u00d7 (3/23) = (15 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 3) / (25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23) = 315 / 13,800.\n\nSimplify that: 315 divided by 15 is 21, and 13,800 divided by 15 is 920, so 21/920.\n\nThen, multiply by 6: 21 \u00d7 6 = 126, and 920 remains the same, so 126/920.\n\nSimplify 126/920 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2: 63/460.\n\nAlright, that matches the earlier result of 63/460.\n\nIs there another way to confirm this?\n\nPerhaps using combinations for each eye color group.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one brown-eyed person is C(15, 1) = 15.\n\nSimilarly, C(7, 1) = 7 for blue-eyed, and C(3, 1) = 3 for green-eyed.\n\nSo, the number of favorable groups is C(15, 1) \u00d7 C(7, 1) \u00d7 C(3, 1) = 15 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 3 = 315.\n\nTotal number of possible groups is C(25, 3) = 2,300.\n\nThus, probability is 315 / 2,300 = 63/460.\n\nSeems consistent across different approaches.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether there are any restrictions or if I've missed anything.\n\nFor example, are there any people with eye colors other than brown, blue, or green? The problem says 15 brown, 7 blue, and 3 green, which adds up to 25, so no others.\n\nAlso, assuming that eye colors are mutually exclusive, meaning no person has more than one eye color.\n\nSeems fair.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the selection is without replacement, meaning once a person is selected, they're not put back into the pool. That's typically how these problems are set up, and that's what I've assumed in the calculations above.\n\nSo, I think 63/460 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me just double-check the arithmetic to be sure.\n\nStarting with 315 / 2,300.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 315 \u00f7 5 = 63, 2,300 \u00f7 5 = 460, so 63/460.\n\nNo common factors between 63 and 460 other than 1, so it's simplified.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 63/460.\n\nAlternatively, if preferred, this can be expressed as a decimal.\n\n63 divided by 460 is approximately 0.1369565..., which is roughly 13.7%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form, leaving it as a fraction is fine.\n\nSo, the final answer is 63/460.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{63}{460}} \\]"
