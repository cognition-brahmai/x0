        "content": "So the farmer has 5 different types of seeds, and he wants to plant exactly 3 types at a time. He's looking for unique combinations, meaning the order doesn't matter. So, for example, planting seeds A, B, and C is the same as planting B, C, and A; it's considered one combination.\n\nThis sounds like a combination problem in mathematics, where we calculate the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order of selection. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\n- \\( k! \\) is the factorial of k.\n\n- \\( (n - k)! \\) is the factorial of (n - k).\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 5 \\) (the total types of seeds) and \\( k = 3 \\) (the number of seeds to plant at a time).\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the factorials:\n\n- \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\)\n\n- \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n\n- \\( 2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 3) = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer can make 10 unique combinations of 3 types of seeds from his 5 types.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it step by step:\n\n1. Choose the first type of seed: 5 options.\n\n2. Choose the second type: 4 remaining options.\n\n3. Choose the third type: 3 remaining options.\n\nSo, initially, it seems like there are \\( 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 60 \\) possible choices. However, this counts every possible permutation (order matters), but since the order doesn't matter in combinations, we've overcounted.\n\nEach combination of 3 seeds can be arranged in \\( 3! = 6 \\) different ways. Therefore, to get the number of unique combinations, we need to divide the total permutations by the number of arrangements per combination:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of combinations} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10\n\\]\n\nThis matches the result from the combination formula.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible combinations:\n\nAssume the seeds are labeled A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nThe combinations are:\n\n1. A, B, C\n\n2. A, B, D\n\n3. A, B, E\n\n4. A, C, D\n\n5. A, C, E\n\n6. A, D, E\n\n7. B, C, D\n\n8. B, C, E\n\n9. B, D, E\n\n10. C, D, E\n\nTotaling 10 unique combinations.\n\nSo, the farmer has 10 unique ways to plant exactly 3 types of seeds from his 5 types.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
