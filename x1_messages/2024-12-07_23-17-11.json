        "content": "So I've got this problem here about fencing a rectangular garden. The garden is 20 feet by 30 feet, and the gardener wants to put a fence around the entire thing, including a gate that's 4 feet wide. I need to find out the total length of fencing needed.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the perimeter of the garden since the fence is going around the entire thing. For a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all the sides. So, for a 20 ft by 30 ft rectangle, the perimeter would be 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. That means:\n\nPerimeter = 2*(30) + 2*(20) = 60 + 40 = 100 feet.\n\nNow, there's a gate that's 4 feet wide. I'm not sure if that means I need to add 4 feet to the perimeter or if the gate is part of the fencing. Maybe the gate is a separate piece that needs to be included in the total fencing length.\n\nWait, perhaps the gate is a part of the fence that swings open, so maybe I need to account for the gate's width in addition to the perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate is just a section of the fence that is 4 feet wide, and the rest is solid fencing. In that case, the total fencing would still be the same as the perimeter because the gate is included within the perimeter.\n\nBut the problem says \"with an additional gate that is 4 feet wide,\" which makes me think that perhaps the gate is an extra piece beyond the regular fencing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional gate that is 4 feet wide.\"\n\nHmm, so it's around the entire garden, and then an additional gate that is 4 feet wide. Maybe the gate is in addition to the fencing required for the perimeter.\n\nSo, the total fencing would be the perimeter plus the length of the gate.\n\nThat would be 100 feet (perimeter) plus 4 feet (gate) equals 104 feet.\n\nBut wait, if the gate is part of the perimeter, then perhaps I shouldn't just add it directly. Maybe the gate replaces a 4-foot section of the fence, so the total fencing would still be 100 feet, and the gate is incorporated into that length.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is an addition to the fence, perhaps for access somewhere, then it would be extra.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If the garden is rectangular, and the fence goes around it, and there's a gate that is 4 feet wide, possibly as an entrance, then the gate is likely part of the fence, meaning it's included in the perimeter.\n\nIn that case, the total fencing needed would still be the perimeter, which is 100 feet, and the gate is factored into that length.\n\nBut the problem says \"with an additional gate that is 4 feet wide,\" which suggests that the gate is something extra beyond the basic fencing around the garden.\n\nMaybe the gate is a separate piece, like a gate that needs to be built additionally to the fencing.\n\nIn that case, the total fencing would be the perimeter plus the length of the gate.\n\nSo, 100 feet + 4 feet = 104 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is already accounted for in the perimeter, and I don't need to add extra length for it.\n\nLet me think differently. If I were to build a fence around the garden and include a gate that is 4 feet wide, I would need fencing for the entire perimeter, and the gate would be installed within that fencing, perhaps replacing a 4-foot section of the fence with a gate instead of solid fencing.\n\nIn this scenario, the total fencing material needed would still be the same as the perimeter, 100 feet, because the gate is substituting for that 4-foot section.\n\nHowever, if the gate is in addition to the fencing around the perimeter, then I would need to add the length of the gate to the perimeter.\n\nBut logically, when you have a gate, it's usually part of the fence, not an addition outside of the fence.\n\nSo, perhaps the total fencing needed is just the perimeter, 100 feet, and the gate is incorporated within that length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate requires additional fencing because it has posts or other structures.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any details about the gate's construction, so I should probably assume it's a simple gate that replaces a 4-foot section of the fence.\n\nIn that case, the total fencing needed would be 100 feet.\n\nWait, but if the gate replaces a 4-foot section, then shouldn't I subtract that section from the perimeter and then add the gate's fencing?\n\nBut that seems unnecessary because the gate still requires fencing material for its sides.\n\nActually, a gate typically has two sides that are posts or frames, so perhaps those posts are already included in the perimeter fencing.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me consider that the gate is installed within the fence, replacing a 4-foot section of the fence with a movable gate.\n\nIn that case, the total fencing material needed would still be 100 feet, as the gate is part of that perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is an addition to the fence, perhaps because it's a separate entrance, then I would need to add the 4 feet to the perimeter.\n\nBut the problem says \"with an additional gate that is 4 feet wide,\" which suggests it's extra.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the total fencing needed is 104 feet.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make complete sense because gates are usually incorporated into the existing fence.\n\nLet me try to think of it this way: the perimeter is 100 feet, and the gate is 4 feet wide. If the gate is part of the fence, then the fencing material needed is 100 feet, including the gate.\n\nBut the problem says \"additional gate,\" which might imply that it's extra beyond the perimeter.\n\nIn that case, 100 feet for the fence plus 4 feet for the gate would be 104 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is already included in the perimeter, and I don't need to add extra.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look up similar problems or think about real-world scenarios.\n\nIn real life, when you install a gate in a fence, you usually account for it within the perimeter fencing, meaning you don't add extra length for the gate.\n\nYou might need to adjust for the posts or frames, but generally, the gate replaces a section of the fence.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the total fencing needed is still 100 feet.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"additional gate,\" which might suggest otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate is separate from the fence, like an additional structure.\n\nIn that case, I would need to add the gate's length to the perimeter.\n\nGiven that, the total fencing needed would be 104 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gate is built into the fence, and I don't need to add extra length.\n\nIn that case, the total fencing is 100 feet.\n\nI need to make a decision based on the information given.\n\nThe problem says \"build a fence around the entire garden with an additional gate that is 4 feet wide.\"\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is that the gate is part of the fence, and therefore the total fencing needed is the perimeter plus the length of the gate.\n\nThus, 100 feet + 4 feet = 104 feet.\n\nTherefore, the total length of fencing needed is 104 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{104} \\]"
