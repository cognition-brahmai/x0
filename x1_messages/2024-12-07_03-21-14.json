        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To create a Python function that calculates the sum of all digits of a given number, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the problem**: We need to take an integer as input and return the sum of its digits. For example, if the input is 123, the sum should be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\n2. **Plan the solution**:\n   - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.\n   - Iterate through each character in the string.\n   - Convert each character back to an integer.\n   - Sum all these integers.\n\n3. **Write the code**:\n   - Define a function, say `sum_of_digits`, that takes one parameter, the number.\n   - Inside the function, convert the number to a string.\n   - Use a loop to iterate through each character in the string.\n   - Convert each character to an integer and add it to a running total.\n   - Return the total sum.\n\n4. **Test the function**:\n   - Test with different numbers to ensure it works correctly.\n   - Consider edge cases like negative numbers and zero.\n\n5. **Optimize if necessary**:\n   - Check if there's a more efficient way to perform the operation.\n   - Ensure the function is readable and maintainable.\n\nLet's implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, we define the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(number):\n    # Convert the number to string\n    num_str = str(number)\n    \n    # Initialize sum\n    total = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for char in num_str:\n        # Convert character to integer and add to total\n        if char.isdigit():\n            total += int(char)\n    \n    return total\n```\n\nNow, let's test this function with some examples:\n\n- `sum_of_digits(123)` should return 6.\n- `sum_of_digits(456)` should return 15.\n- `sum_of_digits(-789)` should return 24, assuming we ignore the negative sign.\n- `sum_of_digits(0)` should return 0.\n\nLet's try these:\n\n```python\nprint(sum_of_digits(123))  # Output: 6\nprint(sum_of_digits(456))  # Output: 15\nprint(sum_of_digits(-789)) # Output: 24\nprint(sum_of_digits(0))    # Output: 0\n```\n\nSeems correct!\n\nAlternatively, we can handle negative numbers more explicitly by taking the absolute value:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(number):\n    # Take absolute value to handle negative numbers\n    number = abs(number)\n    \n    # Convert the number to string\n    num_str = str(number)\n    \n    # Initialize sum\n    total = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for char in num_str:\n        # Convert character to integer and add to total\n        if char.isdigit():\n            total += int(char)\n    \n    return total\n```\n\nThis way, we ensure that the negative sign doesn't affect the sum.\n\nAnother approach without converting to string:\n\nWe can use mathematical operations to extract each digit and sum them up.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(number):\n    # Take absolute value to handle negative numbers\n    number = abs(number)\n    \n    # Initialize sum\n    total = 0\n    \n    # Loop until the number is reduced to 0\n    while number > 0:\n        # Get the last digit\n        digit = number % 10\n        # Add digit to total\n        total += digit\n        # Remove the last digit\n        number = number // 10\n    \n    return total\n```\n\nThis method uses modulo (%) to get the last digit and integer division (//) to remove the last digit, repeating until the number is 0.\n\nLet's test this alternative implementation:\n\n```python\nprint(sum_of_digits(123))  # Output: 6\nprint(sum_of_digits(456))  # Output: 15\nprint(sum_of_digits(-789)) # Output: 24\nprint(sum_of_digits(0))    # Output: 0\n```\n\nBoth methods yield the same results. You can choose the one that you find more understandable or efficient.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that calculates the sum of all digits of a given integer. We will explore two methods to achieve this: one involving string conversion and iteration, and another using purely mathematical operations.\n\n### Approach 1: String Conversion\n\n1. **Convert the number to a string** to easily access each digit.\n2. **Iterate through each character** in the string.\n3. **Convert each character back to an integer** and sum them up.\n\nThis approach is straightforward and leverages Python's string handling capabilities.\n\n### Approach 2: Mathematical Operations\n\n1. **Take the absolute value** of the number to handle negative numbers.\n2. **Use a while loop** to extract each digit using the modulo operator (`%`).\n3. **Sum the digits** and remove the last digit using integer division (`//`).\n\nThis approach avoids string conversion and is efficient for large numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n#### Method 1: Using String Conversion\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(number):\n    # Convert the number to string\n    num_str = str(abs(number))\n    \n    # Initialize sum\n    total = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for char in num_str:\n        # Convert character to integer and add to total\n        if char.isdigit():\n            total += int(char)\n    \n    return total\n```\n\n#### Method 2: Using Mathematical Operations\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(number):\n    # Take absolute value to handle negative numbers\n    number = abs(number)\n    \n    # Initialize sum\n    total = 0\n    \n    # Loop until the number is reduced to 0\n    while number > 0:\n        # Get the last digit\n        digit = number % 10\n        # Add digit to total\n        total += digit\n        # Remove the last digit\n        number = number // 10\n    \n    return total\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nBoth methods ensure that the sum of digits is calculated correctly for any integer input, including negative numbers and zero.\n\n- **String Conversion Method**: This method is simple and leverages Python's built-in string functions. It converts the number to a string, iterates through each character, checks if it's a digit, converts it back to an integer, and sums them up.\n\n- **Mathematical Operations Method**: This method uses modulo and integer division to extract and remove digits one by one until the number is reduced to zero. It handles negative numbers by taking their absolute value.\n\nYou can choose either method based on your preference or specific requirements."
