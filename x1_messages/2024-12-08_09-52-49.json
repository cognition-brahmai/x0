He was born in Florida, Missouri, in 1835 and grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which served as the inspiration for the settings in many of his famous works. Twain is celebrated for his use of humor, satire, and local color in his writing, and he is often regarded as one of the greatest writers in American literature. His works not only entertained but also tackled serious social issues, such as racism and injustice, particularly in \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" which is often called one of the greatest American novels."
