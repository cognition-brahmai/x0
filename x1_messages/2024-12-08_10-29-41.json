        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 100 widgets per hour, and 5% of those are defective. The quality control team checks every single widget, which means they're inspecting all 100 per hour, not just the defective ones. Got it.\n\nNow, there's a worker who can inspect 20 widgets per hour. We need to figure out how many such workers are needed to inspect all the widgets produced in an 8-hour shift.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many widgets are produced in total during an 8-hour shift.\n\nWidgets per hour: 100\n\nHours in a shift: 8\n\nTotal widgets in 8 hours: 100 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 800 widgets\n\nSo, 800 widgets are produced in an 8-hour shift.\n\nNext, each worker can inspect 20 widgets per hour. But since the shift is 8 hours long, each worker can inspect:\n\n20 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 160 widgets per shift\n\nNow, we have 800 widgets to inspect, and each worker can handle 160 widgets per shift. To find out how many workers are needed, we divide the total number of widgets by the number of widgets one worker can inspect:\n\n800 widgets / 160 widgets/worker = 5 workers\n\nSo, it seems like we need 5 workers to inspect all the widgets produced in an 8-hour shift.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's anything else we need to consider. The problem mentions that 5% of the widgets are defective, but does that affect the inspection process? Since the quality control team inspects every widget, whether defective or not, the defect rate doesn't change the total number of inspections needed. So, it's just a red herring in this case.\n\nAlso, we assumed that the workers work the entire 8-hour shift without breaks, which is standard in these types of problems unless specified otherwise.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the workers can work overtime or if there's any time lost due to breaks, but the problem doesn't mention any of that, so we'll stick with the 8-hour shift.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 5 workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
