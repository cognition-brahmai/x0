The list is sorted by memory usage in descending order.\n\n```powershell\n# Get all running processes and select specific properties\n$Processes = Get-Process | Select-Object Id, Name, @{Name=\"MemoryUsageMB\"; Expression={\"{0:N2}\" -f ($_.WS / 1MB)}}, CPU\n\n# Sort the processes by memory usage in descending order\n$SortedProcesses = $Processes | Sort-Object MemoryUsageMB -Descending\n\n# Display the sorted list\n$SortedProcesses | Format-Table -AutoSize\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Get-Process**: This cmdlet retrieves all running processes on the system.\n2. **Select-Object**: This is used to choose specific properties of the processes:\n   - `Id`: Process ID (PID)\n   - `Name`: Name of the process\n   - `MemoryUsageMB`: Calculated property to display working set (memory usage) in megabytes, formatted to two decimal places.\n   - `CPU`: CPU time used by the process.\n3. **Sort-Object**: Sorts the processes based on the `MemoryUsageMB` property in descending order.\n4. **Format-Table -AutoSize**: Formats the output as a table with automatic column width adjustment for better readability.\n\nYou can run this script in PowerShell to get the desired list of processes sorted by memory usage."
