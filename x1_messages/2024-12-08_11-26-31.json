        "content": "So, the train travels 200 miles in 4 hours. That means its speed is constant throughout the journey. To find out how long it would take to travel 500 miles at the same speed, I need to first figure out what that constant speed is.\n\nSpeed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it takes to travel that distance. So, speed equals distance divided by time. In this case, the speed (s) is 200 miles divided by 4 hours, which is s = 200 miles / 4 hours = 50 miles per hour.\n\nNow that I know the train's constant speed is 50 miles per hour, I can use that to find out how long it would take to travel 500 miles. Time is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed. So, time (t) equals distance divided by speed. Therefore, t = 500 miles / 50 miles per hour = 10 hours.\n\nSo, it would take 10 hours to travel 500 miles at the same constant speed.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If the train travels 200 miles in 4 hours, that's 50 miles per hour. Then, for 500 miles at 50 miles per hour, it should indeed take 10 hours. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If 200 miles takes 4 hours, then 500 miles would take x hours. So, setting up a proportion: 200 miles / 4 hours = 500 miles / x hours. Solving for x, I get 200x = 4 * 500, which is 200x = 2000, so x = 10 hours. Same answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many times 200 miles fits into 500 miles. 500 divided by 200 is 2.5. So, it's 2.5 times the distance. Since time is directly proportional to distance at a constant speed, it should take 2.5 times as long. 4 hours times 2.5 equals 10 hours. Again, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The answer is 10 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
