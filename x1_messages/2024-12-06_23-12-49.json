        "content": "So the factory produces 150 widgets per hour, and we need to find out how many it will produce in a non-stop 30-day month. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to know how many hours there are in a day. Typically, there are 24 hours in a day. So, if the factory is running non-stop, it's operating 24 hours a day.\n\nSo, daily production would be:\n\n150 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 3600 widgets/day\n\nNow, for a 30-day month, the total production would be:\n\n3600 widgets/day * 30 days = 108,000 widgets\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me see, 150 widgets per hour, 24 hours a day, 30 days a month.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of hours in 30 days and then multiply by the hourly production rate.\n\nTotal hours in 30 days: 24 hours/day * 30 days = 720 hours\n\nThen, total production: 150 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 108,000 widgets\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nBut, perhaps I should consider if there are any breaks or maintenance times. The problem says \"non-stop,\" so I assume it's running continuously without any downtime.\n\nAlso, I should make sure about the number of days in the month. It specifies a 30-day month, so I'm using 30 days.\n\nWait, sometimes months have 31 days, or February has 28 or 29. But the question clearly says a 30-day month, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory operates 24 hours a day without any stops, then my calculation should be accurate.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Let's calculate the number of widgets produced per minute and then for the entire month, but that seems unnecessary since the production rate is given per hour.\n\n150 widgets per hour means:\n\n150 widgets / 60 minutes = 2.5 widgets per minute\n\nBut then, total minutes in 30 days: 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 30 days = 43,200 minutes\n\nTotal production: 2.5 widgets/minute * 43,200 minutes = 108,000 widgets\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that 108,000 widgets is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory operates 24/7 without any breaks, then yes, it's 150 widgets per hour for 720 hours in 30 days, totaling 108,000 widgets.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider leap years or anything like that, since the month is specified as 30 days.\n\nSo, the final answer is 108,000 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108000} \\]"
