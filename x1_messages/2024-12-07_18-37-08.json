        "content": "A university is planning to renovate its dormitories over the summer break. There are 10 dormitory buildings, each with 50 rooms. Each room requires new flooring at a cost of $20 per square foot, and an average room size is 200 square feet. Additionally, each building needs a new roof at a cost of $30,000 per building. Calculate the total cost of renovations for all dormitories, providing step-by-step reasoning."

        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help with that calculation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the cost of new flooring for each room. Each room requires new flooring at a cost of $20 per square foot, and the average room size is 200 square feet. So, the cost for flooring in one room would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Flooring cost per room} = 200 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\times \\$20/\\text{sq ft} = \\$4,000 \\]\n\nNext, since there are 50 rooms in each dormitory building, the total flooring cost for one building would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Flooring cost per building} = 50 \\, \\text{rooms} \\times \\$4,000/\\text{room} = \\$200,000 \\]\n\nAdditionally, each building needs a new roof, which costs $30,000 per building. So, the total cost for roofing per building is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Roofing cost per building} = \\$30,000 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total cost for renovations in one building, we add the flooring cost and the roofing cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost per building} = \\$200,000 + \\$30,000 = \\$230,000 \\]\n\nSince there are 10 dormitory buildings, the total cost for all buildings would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for all buildings} = 10 \\, \\text{buildings} \\times \\$230,000/\\text{building} = \\$2,300,000 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of renovations for all dormitories is \\$2,300,000.\n\n**Summary of calculations:**\n\n1. Flooring cost per room: \\( 200 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\times \\$20/\\text{sq ft} = \\$4,000 \\)\n2. Flooring cost per building: \\( 50 \\, \\text{rooms} \\times \\$4,000/\\text{room} = \\$200,000 \\)\n3. Roofing cost per building: \\$30,000\n4. Total cost per building: \\$200,000 + \\$30,000 = \\$230,000\n5. Total cost for all 10 buildings: \\( 10 \\times \\$230,000 = \\$2,300,000 \\)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2300000} \\]"
