        "content": "Let's tackle this family gathering problem. So, we have 15 people in total. Among them, there are 4 pairs of siblings and 3 pairs of cousins. Each pair of siblings has the same two parents, and each pair of cousins shares only one parent in common. We need to find out how many unique parents are present at the gathering.\n\nFirst, let's understand the relationships:\n\n1. **Siblings**: Share both parents.\n\n2. **Cousins**: Share only one parent.\n\nGiven that, let's try to model this.\n\n### Step 1: Siblings\n\nThere are 4 pairs of siblings. Each pair has the same two parents. So, for each pair of siblings, there are 2 parents.\n\nBut wait, are these parents shared across different sibling pairs? Or are they unique to each pair?\n\nHmm.\n\nIf each pair of siblings has unique parents not shared with other pairs, then the number of parents would be 4 pairs \u00d7 2 parents = 8 parents.\n\nBut, considering that some parents might be shared across different pairs, especially since there are also cousin relationships.\n\n### Step 2: Cousins\n\nThere are 3 pairs of cousins. Each pair shares only one parent.\n\nThis suggests that for each pair of cousins, they have one parent in common and their other parents are different.\n\nNow, how do these cousin pairs relate to the sibling pairs?\n\n### Step 3: Relating Siblings and Cousins\n\nLet's think about how siblings and cousins are related.\n\n- Siblings share both parents.\n\n- Cousins share one parent.\n\nPerhaps some of the parents of the siblings are also parents of the cousins.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. Maybe it's better to visualize this with a diagram or to use some notation.\n\nLet's try to denote the people:\n\nLet\u2019s say the 4 pairs of siblings are:\n\n- Pair 1: A and B, parents: P1 and Q1\n\n- Pair 2: C and D, parents: P2 and Q2\n\n- Pair 3: E and F, parents: P3 and Q3\n\n- Pair 4: G and H, parents: P4 and Q4\n\nSo, we have A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, P1, Q1, P2, Q2, P3, Q3, P4, Q4.\n\nWait, but the total number of people is 15, and here I've already listed 8 children and 8 parents, which is 16, which is more than 15.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. So, there must be some overlap in parents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some people are both siblings and cousins, but that seems confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Total People\n\nTotal people: 15.\n\nNumber of sibling pairs: 4, which means 8 people (since each pair has 2 siblings).\n\nNumber of cousin pairs: 3, which means 6 people (since each pair has 2 cousins).\n\nBut 8 + 6 = 14, which is less than 15. So, there might be some overlap in these counts, meaning some people are counted in both sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nAlternatively, there might be other people present who are neither siblings nor cousins in these pairs.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"among them, there are 4 pairs of siblings and 3 pairs of cousins,\" which suggests that these are in addition to other people.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\n### Step 5: Parents of Siblings\n\nEach pair of siblings has two unique parents. So, for 4 pairs, that would be 8 parents, but perhaps some parents are shared across sibling pairs.\n\nWait, no, siblings share both parents, so if there are 4 distinct pairs, their parents would be distinct unless some parents have more than one pair of siblings.\n\nThe problem says \"4 pairs of siblings,\" which could imply that some siblings might share parents with other siblings.\n\nWait, but if there are 4 distinct pairs, and each pair has unique parents, then there would be 8 parents.\n\nBut then, adding the cousins complicates things.\n\n### Step 6: Cousins and Their Parents\n\nEach pair of cousins shares one parent. So, for each cousin pair, there is one parent in common and one different parent.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Pair 1 of cousins: I and J, share parent P1, and have parents Q1 and Q2 respectively.\n\n- Pair 2: K and L, share parent P2, and have parents Q3 and Q4 respectively.\n\n- Pair 3: M and N, share parent P3, and have parents Q5 and Q6 respectively.\n\nAssuming that these parents are distinct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps some parents are shared between sibling pairs and cousin pairs.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\n### Step 7: Total People Calculation\n\nLet's try to calculate the total number of unique people based on the relationships.\n\n- 4 pairs of siblings: 8 siblings + 8 parents (if parents are unique) = 16 people, but total is 15, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, parents must be shared across sibling pairs.\n\nWait, but siblings share both parents, so if two sibling pairs share a parent, they would actually be cousins to each other, which contradicts the distinct pairs.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the cousins are also siblings, but that doesn't make sense because siblings share both parents, while cousins share only one.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to consider the entire family structure.\n\n### Step 8: Family Tree Approach\n\nLet's consider that there are multiple generations.\n\nAssume there are grandparents, parents, and children.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify generations, so perhaps that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of parents and their children.\n\nLet\u2019s denote parents as P1, P2, P3, etc., and their children accordingly.\n\n### Step 9: Modeling the Relationships\n\nLet\u2019s try to model the relationships step by step.\n\n1. **Sibling Pairs:**\n\n   - Pair 1: A and B, parents: P1 and P2\n\n   - Pair 2: C and D, parents: P3 and P4\n\n   - Pair 3: E and F, parents: P5 and P6\n\n   - Pair 4: G and H, parents: P7 and P8\n\n   So far, we have 8 children and 8 parents.\n\n2. **Cousin Pairs:**\n\n   - Pair 1: I and J, share parent P1 (from Pair 1's siblings)\n\n     - So, I and J have parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2 respectively.\n\n   - Pair 2: K and L, share parent P3 (from Pair 2's siblings)\n\n     - Parents: P3 and Q3, P3 and Q4\n\n   - Pair 3: M and N, share parent P5 (from Pair 3's siblings)\n\n     - Parents: P5 and Q5, P5 and Q6\n\n   Now, adding I, J, K, L, M, N, and their additional parents Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6.\n\n   So, total people so far:\n\n   - Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n   - Parents: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6\n\n   That's 14 children + 14 parents = 28 people, which is way more than 15.\n\n   Clearly, this approach is wrong because it exceeds the total number of people.\n\n### Step 10: Reducing the Number of Parents\n\nWe need to find a way to share parents across sibling and cousin pairs to reduce the total number of unique parents.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- Suppose P1 and P2 are parents of A and B (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 is also a parent of I and J (cousin pair).\n\n   - So, I and J have parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\n   - This means Q1 and Q2 are different from P2, otherwise I and J would be siblings with A and B, which contradicts.\n\n- Similarly, P3 and P4 are parents of C and D.\n\n- P3 is also a parent of K and L.\n\n   - K and L have parents P3 and Q3, P3 and Q4.\n\n- P5 and P6 are parents of E and F.\n\n- P5 is also a parent of M and N.\n\n   - M and N have parents P5 and Q5, P5 and Q6.\n\n- G and H are siblings with parents P7 and P8.\n\nNow, let's list all unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6\n\nStill, that's 14 children + 14 parents = 28 people, which is too many.\n\n### Step 11: Overlapping Parents Further\n\nWe need to find a way to have parents being counted in multiple roles without increasing the total number of unique individuals.\n\nPerhaps some parents are also children in another relationship.\n\nBut that would suggest overlapping generations, which might not be intended.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some individuals are both parents and children, but that would be unusual.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the cousin pairs involve children from different sibling pairs.\n\nLet\u2019s try to think differently.\n\n### Step 12: Different Approach\n\nLet\u2019s consider that some parents of siblings are also parents of other siblings or cousins.\n\nFor example:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and Q1 are parents of I and J (cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P2 and Q2 are parents of K and L (another cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- Similarly, P3 and P4 are parents of C and D (another sibling pair).\n\n- P3 and Q3 are parents of M and N (cousin pair to C and D).\n\n- P4 and Q4 are parents of O and P (another cousin pair to C and D).\n\nBut now, we have more than 15 people.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\n### Step 13: Simplifying the Model\n\nMaybe there are overlapping parents between sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nLet\u2019s assume:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and Q1 are parents of C and D (cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P2 and Q2 are parents of E and F (another cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P3 and P4 are parents of G and H (another sibling pair).\n\n- P3 and Q3 are parents of I and J (cousin pair to G and H).\n\n- P4 and Q4 are parents of K and L (another cousin pair to G and H).\n\nNow, listing unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, Q2, P3, P4, Q3, Q4\n\nTotal: 12 children + 8 parents = 20 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 14: Further Overlapping Parents\n\nWe need to reduce the number of unique parents. Perhaps some parents are shared across multiple roles.\n\nFor example:\n\n- P1 is a parent to A and B (sibling pair) and also to C and D (cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P2 is a parent to A and B, and to E and F (another cousin pair).\n\n- P3 is a parent to G and H (sibling pair) and to I and J (cousin pair).\n\n- P4 is a parent to G and H and to K and L (another cousin pair).\n\nBut this still seems to require multiple unique parents.\n\n### Step 15: Considering That Some Parents Are the Same\n\nWait a minute, perhaps some of the parents in different pairs are the same persons.\n\nFor example, P1 could be a parent in multiple sibling or cousin pairs.\n\nLet\u2019s try to maximize the sharing of parents.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and Q1 are parents of C and D (cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P2 and Q2 are parents of E and F (another cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P1 and P3 are parents of G and H (another sibling pair).\n\n- P3 and Q3 are parents of I and J (cousin pair to G and H).\n\n- P3 and Q4 are parents of K and L (another cousin pair to G and H).\n\nNow, listing unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, Q2, P3, Q3, Q4\n\nTotal: 12 children + 7 parents = 19 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 16: Minimizing Parents Further\n\nWe need to minimize the number of unique parents further.\n\nPerhaps some parents are shared across multiple cousin and sibling pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and Q1 are parents of C and D (cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P2 and Q1 are parents of E and F (another cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of G and H (another sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and Q2 are parents of I and J (cousin pair to G and H).\n\n- P2 and Q2 are parents of K and L (another cousin pair to G and H).\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, Q2\n\nTotal: 12 children + 4 parents = 16 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 17: Adjusting for Total of 15 People\n\nWe need to have only 15 people in total. So, we need to reduce the number of unique parents and children.\n\nPerhaps some children are being counted in multiple pairs.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies \"pairs of siblings\" and \"pairs of cousins,\" implying distinct pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some individuals are in both a sibling pair and a cousin pair.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A and B are siblings (parents P1 and P2).\n\n- A and C are cousins (A and C share parent P1).\n\n   - So, C has parents P1 and Q1.\n\n- B and D are cousins (B and D share parent P2).\n\n   - So, D has parents P2 and Q2.\n\n- E and F are siblings (parents P3 and P4).\n\n- E and G are cousins (E and G share parent P3).\n\n   - So, G has parents P3 and Q3.\n\n- F and H are cousins (F and H share parent P4).\n\n   - So, H has parents P4 and Q4.\n\n- I and J are siblings (parents P5 and P6).\n\nBut now, counting unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, Q2, P3, P4, Q3, Q4, P5, P6\n\nTotal: 10 children + 10 parents = 20 people, still too many.\n\n### Step 18: Trying a Different Structure\n\nLet\u2019s consider that some of the cousin pairs are between siblings and cousins.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A and B are siblings (parents P1 and P2).\n\n- C and D are siblings (parents P1 and Q1).\n\n   - So, C and D are cousins to A and B through shared parent P1.\n\n- E and F are siblings (parents P2 and Q2).\n\n   - So, E and F are cousins to A and B through shared parent P2.\n\n- G and H are siblings (parents P3 and P4).\n\n- I and J are siblings (parents P3 and Q3).\n\n   - Cousins to G and H through shared parent P3.\n\n- K and L are siblings (parents P4 and Q4).\n\n   - Cousins to G and H through shared parent P4.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, Q2, P3, P4, Q3, Q4\n\nTotal: 12 children + 8 parents = 20 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 19: Reducing Parents by Overlapping Roles\n\nWe need to find a way to have parents serving in multiple roles to reduce the total count.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and Q1 are parents of C and D (cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P2 and Q1 are parents of E and F (another cousin pair to A and B).\n\n- P1 and P2 are also parents of G and H (another sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and Q2 are parents of I and J (cousin pair to G and H).\n\n- P2 and Q2 are parents of K and L (another cousin pair to G and H).\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, Q2\n\nTotal: 12 children + 4 parents = 16 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 20: Including the Parents Themselves\n\nWait, perhaps some of the 15 people include the parents themselves, and possibly grandparents.\n\nBut the problem states \"in a family gathering, there are 15 people,\" and \"among them, there are 4 pairs of siblings and 3 pairs of cousins.\"\n\nThis suggests that all 15 people are part of these relationships.\n\n### Step 21: Considering Overlapping Roles\n\nMaybe some individuals are both parents and children in different relationships.\n\nFor example:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B.\n\n- P1 and Q1 are parents of C and D.\n\n- P2 and Q1 are parents of E and F.\n\n- A and C are cousins (shared parent P1).\n\n- B and D are cousins (shared parent P1).\n\n- A and E are cousins (shared parent P2).\n\n- B and F are cousins (shared parent P2).\n\nBut this still gives us:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1\n\nTotal: 6 children + 3 parents = 9 people, which is less than 15.\n\nSo, we need to add more pairs.\n\n### Step 22: Adding More Relationships\n\nLet\u2019s add another sibling pair:\n\n- P3 and P4 are parents of G and H.\n\n- P3 and Q2 are parents of I and J.\n\n- P4 and Q2 are parents of K and L.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, P3, P4, Q2\n\nTotal: 12 children + 6 parents = 18 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 23: Minimizing Further\n\nWe need to minimize the number of unique parents.\n\nPerhaps some parents are serving in multiple roles.\n\nFor example:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B.\n\n- P1 and Q1 are parents of C and D.\n\n- P2 and Q1 are parents of E and F.\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of G and H.\n\n- P1 and Q2 are parents of I and J.\n\n- P2 and Q2 are parents of K and L.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, Q2\n\nTotal: 12 children + 4 parents = 16 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 24: Adjusting for Total of 15\n\nWe need to have only 15 people. Maybe some of the supposed parents are actually children in another relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some individuals are their own parents in some twisted way, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the cousin pairs are overlapping with sibling pairs in a way that reduces the total count.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\n### Step 25: Using Graph Theory\n\nThinking of this in terms of graph theory, where people are nodes, and relationships (sibling or cousin) are edges.\n\n- Siblings: fully connected component with 2 parents.\n\n- Cousins: connected through one parent.\n\nBut this might be too abstract for this problem.\n\n### Step 26: Looking for a Pattern\n\nPerhaps there is a pattern or formula to calculate the number of unique parents based on the number of sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- S = number of sibling pairs = 4\n\n- C = number of cousin pairs = 3\n\nEach sibling pair has 2 parents.\n\nEach cousin pair shares 1 parent and has another unique parent.\n\nBut without knowing how these relationships overlap, it's hard to generalize.\n\n### Step 27: Assuming Minimal Overlap\n\nTo minimize the number of unique parents, we need to maximize the overlap of parents across different pairs.\n\nIn the extreme case, if all sibling and cousin pairs share the same set of parents, then the number of unique parents would be minimized.\n\nBut is that possible given the constraints?\n\nLet\u2019s try to see.\n\n- Suppose P1 and P2 are parents of 4 sibling pairs.\n\n   - But that would mean 8 children are siblings, which contradicts the \"pairs of siblings.\"\n\n- Alternatively, perhaps P1 and P2 are parents of some sibling pairs and cousin pairs.\n\nBut it's getting too convoluted.\n\n### Step 28: Trying a Smaller Example\n\nLet\u2019s consider a smaller version of the problem to understand the pattern.\n\nSuppose there is 1 pair of siblings and 1 pair of cousins.\n\n- Siblings: A and B, parents: P1 and P2.\n\n- Cousins: C and D, share parent P1, and have parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\nTotal unique people: A, B, C, D, P1, P2, Q1, Q2 \u2192 8 people.\n\nNow, adding another sibling pair:\n\n- E and F, parents: P3 and P4.\n\nTotal: A, B, C, D, E, F, P1, P2, P3, P4, Q1, Q2 \u2192 12 people.\n\nAdding another cousin pair:\n\n- G and H, share parent P3, parents: P3 and Q3, P3 and Q4.\n\nTotal: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, P1, P2, P3, P4, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 \u2192 16 people.\n\nThis is exceeding the count quickly.\n\n### Step 29: Realizing the Complexity\n\nThis problem is more complex than initially thought due to the overlapping relationships.\n\nPerhaps there's a different way to approach it.\n\n### Step 30: Considering Only Parents and Their Offspring\n\nLet\u2019s consider the parents and their offspring.\n\nEach pair of siblings has two unique parents.\n\nEach pair of cousins shares one parent.\n\nWe need to find the number of unique parents present.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the parents as P1, P2, P3, etc.\n\n### Step 31: Modeling with Sets\n\nLet\u2019s model this using sets.\n\n- Let S be the set of sibling pairs.\n\n- Let C be the set of cousin pairs.\n\nEach sibling pair corresponds to a unique pair of parents.\n\nEach cousin pair corresponds to sharing one parent and having another unique parent.\n\n### Step 32: Counting the Parents\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let there be m unique parents.\n\nWe need to find m such that the total number of people is 15.\n\nTotal people = number of children + number of parents.\n\nNumber of children:\n\n- From sibling pairs: 4 pairs \u00d7 2 children = 8 children.\n\n- From cousin pairs: 3 pairs \u00d7 2 children = 6 children.\n\nTotal children: 8 + 6 = 14.\n\nBut total people are 15, so 14 children + 1 parent = 15.\n\nWait, that would imply only 1 unique parent, which is impossible because sibling pairs require two parents.\n\nSo, this approach is flawed.\n\n### Step 33: Overlapping Children in Pairs\n\nPerhaps some children are counted in both sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nFor example, a child can be a sibling to some and a cousin to others.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that some children are in both sibling and cousin pairs.\n\n### Step 34: Adjusting for Overlapping Children\n\nSuppose that some children are in both sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of children who are in both sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nThen, the total number of unique children is:\n\nTotal children = (8 + 6) - x = 14 - x.\n\nGiven that total people are 15, and assuming that the remaining people are parents, then:\n\nNumber of parents = 15 - (14 - x) = 1 + x.\n\nBut we need to find a consistent value for x.\n\n### Step 35: Considering Parent-Child Relationships\n\nEach sibling pair requires 2 parents, and each cousin pair requires 1 shared parent and 2 unique parents.\n\nBut this needs to be accounted for carefully to avoid double-counting.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I should try a different method.\n\n### Step 36: Using Linear Algebra\n\nPerhaps setting up equations based on the relationships.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let m be the number of unique parents.\n\n- Each sibling pair requires 2 parents.\n\n- Each cousin pair requires 1 shared parent and 1 additional parent.\n\nBut without knowing the overlap, it's hard to set up equations.\n\n### Step 37: Considering the Maximum Possible Overlap\n\nTo minimize the number of unique parents, maximize the overlap.\n\nSuppose all cousin pairs share one common parent, and that parent is also a parent in multiple sibling pairs.\n\nLet\u2019s say P1 is a parent in all sibling pairs and all cousin pairs.\n\nBut then, for sibling pairs, each requires two parents, so P1 paired with different parents for each sibling pair.\n\nBut this would require multiple unique parents anyway.\n\nIt's getting too complicated.\n\n### Step 38: Looking for a Simpler Solution\n\nMaybe there's a simpler way to approach this problem.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each sibling pair adds 2 parents, and each cousin pair adds 1 new parent (the shared one) and 1 additional parent.\n\nBut again, without knowing the overlaps, it's tricky.\n\n### Step 39: Trying to Find a Pattern with Smaller Numbers\n\nLet\u2019s try with smaller numbers to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nSuppose there are 2 sibling pairs and 1 cousin pair.\n\n- Sibling pairs: 2 pairs \u00d7 2 parents = 4 parents.\n\n- Cousin pair: shares 1 parent with one of the sibling pairs and has another parent.\n\n   - So, if the cousin pair shares a parent with one of the sibling pairs, say P1, then they have parents P1 and Q1.\n\n   - So, total unique parents: P1, P2, P3, P4, Q1.\n\n   - Total people: 4 (from sibling pairs) + 2 (from cousin pair) = 6 children + 5 parents = 11 people.\n\nSimilarly, for 3 sibling pairs and 2 cousin pairs, it would be more complex.\n\nThis isn't helping much.\n\n### Step 40: Considering the Problem Constraints\n\nGiven that the total number of people is 15, and there are 4 sibling pairs and 3 cousin pairs, we need to find the number of unique parents.\n\nPerhaps the answer is simply 6 unique parents.\n\nBut I need to verify this.\n\n### Step 41: Assuming 6 Unique Parents\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are 6 unique parents: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6.\n\n- Sibling pairs:\n\n  - Pair 1: A and B, parents P1 and P2.\n\n  - Pair 2: C and D, parents P3 and P4.\n\n  - Pair 3: E and F, parents P5 and P6.\n\n  - Pair 4: G and H, parents P1 and P3.\n\n- Cousin pairs:\n\n  - Pair 1: I and J, share parent P1, parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\n  - Pair 2: K and L, share parent P3, parents P3 and Q3, P3 and Q4.\n\n  - Pair 3: M and N, share parent P5, parents P5 and Q5, P5 and Q6.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6\n\nTotal: 14 children + 12 parents = 26 people, which is way over 15.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\n### Step 42: Reducing the Number of Parents\n\nI need to reduce the number of unique parents. Maybe there are only 4 unique parents.\n\nLet\u2019s try with 4 unique parents: P1, P2, P3, P4.\n\n- Sibling pairs:\n\n  - Pair 1: A and B, parents P1 and P2.\n\n  - Pair 2: C and D, parents P1 and P3.\n\n  - Pair 3: E and F, parents P2 and P4.\n\n  - Pair 4: G and H, parents P3 and P4.\n\n- Cousin pairs:\n\n  - Pair 1: I and J, share parent P1, parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\n  - Pair 2: K and L, share parent P2, parents P2 and Q3, P2 and Q4.\n\n  - Pair 3: M and N, share parent P3, parents P3 and Q5, P3 and Q6.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, P3, P4, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6\n\nTotal: 14 children + 10 parents = 24 people, still too many.\n\n### Step 43: Considering That Some Cousins Share Parents with Siblings\n\nPerhaps some of the cousin pairs share parents with the sibling pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Sibling pairs:\n\n  - Pair 1: A and B, parents P1 and P2.\n\n  - Pair 2: C and D, parents P1 and P2.\n\n  - Pair 3: E and F, parents P1 and P2.\n\n  - Pair 4: G and H, parents P1 and P2.\n\n- Cousin pairs:\n\n  - Pair 1: I and J, share parent P1, parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\n  - Pair 2: K and L, share parent P2, parents P2 and Q3, P2 and Q4.\n\n  - Pair 3: M and N, share parent P1, parents P1 and Q5, P1 and Q6.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6\n\nTotal: 14 children + 8 parents = 22 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 44: Trying to Share Parents Differently\n\nLet\u2019s try to have some parents serve in multiple roles more effectively.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B.\n\n- P1 and P3 are parents of C and D.\n\n- P2 and P3 are parents of E and F.\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of G and H.\n\n- P1 and P4 are parents of I and J.\n\n- P2 and P4 are parents of K and L.\n\n- P3 and P4 are parents of M and N.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, P3, P4\n\nTotal: 14 children + 4 parents = 18 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 45: Reducing Further\n\nPerhaps some of the supposed parents are the same person.\n\nFor example, Q1 could be the same as P3, etc.\n\nBut this is getting too convoluted.\n\n### Step 46: Considering That Some Individuals Are Both Siblings and Cousins\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because siblings share both parents, while cousins share only one.\n\nSo, an individual can't be both a sibling and a cousin to another individual in the same pair.\n\n### Step 47: Revisiting the Initial Assumptions\n\nMaybe the initial assumption that each sibling pair has unique parents is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps some sibling pairs share a parent, making some of them cousins to each other.\n\nBut the problem states \"4 pairs of siblings,\" which suggests that these are distinct pairs.\n\n### Step 48: Looking for a Different Approach\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider the entire family structure in terms of generations.\n\nSuppose there are grandparents, parents, and children.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify generations, so that might not be necessary.\n\n### Step 49: Considering That Some Parents Are Not Present\n\nMaybe not all parents are present at the gathering.\n\nBut the problem says \"unique parents present at the gathering,\" so we need to consider only those parents who are present.\n\nBut that adds another layer of complexity.\n\n### Step 50: Simplifying the Problem\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the 15 people include children and parents.\n\nWe have 4 sibling pairs (8 children) and 3 cousin pairs (6 children), totaling 14 children.\n\nTherefore, the number of parents should be 15 - 14 = 1.\n\nBut that can't be right because sibling pairs require 2 parents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some parents are counted among the 15 people.\n\n### Step 51: Reevaluating the Count of Children\n\nWait, perhaps not all children are only in one pair.\n\nSome children might be in both sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nFor example, a child could be a sibling to some and a cousin to others.\n\n### Step 52: Adjusting for Overlapping Children\n\nLet\u2019s assume that some children are in both sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nSuppose that:\n\n- A and B are siblings.\n\n- A is also a cousin to C.\n\n   - So, A shares one parent with C.\n\n- B is a cousin to D.\n\n   - So, B shares one parent with D.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis overlapping could reduce the total number of unique children.\n\n### Step 53: Calculating Unique Children with Overlap\n\nIf each cousin pair shares one parent with one of the sibling pairs, then some children might be double-counted.\n\nBut it's still not clear how to calculate the exact number.\n\n### Step 54: Assuming Maximum Overlap\n\nTo minimize the number of unique parents, assume maximum overlap in parentage.\n\nSuppose all sibling pairs share some parents.\n\nFor example:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B.\n\n- P1 and P3 are parents of C and D.\n\n- P2 and P3 are parents of E and F.\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of G and H.\n\nNow, for the cousin pairs:\n\n- I and J share parent P1.\n\n- K and L share parent P2.\n\n- M and N share parent P3.\n\nSo, parents are P1, P2, P3, and possibly additional parents for the cousin pairs.\n\nBut this is getting tangled.\n\n### Step 55: Considering That Some Cousin Pairs Share Parents with Sibling Pairs\n\nYes, that's likely.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Sibling pairs:\n\n  - A and B: parents P1 and P2.\n\n  - C and D: parents P1 and P3.\n\n  - E and F: parents P2 and P4.\n\n  - G and H: parents P3 and P4.\n\n- Cousin pairs:\n\n  - I and J: share parent P1, say parents P1 and Q1.\n\n  - K and L: share parent P2, say parents P2 and Q2.\n\n  - M and N: share parent P3, say parents P3 and Q3.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, P3, P4, Q1, Q2, Q3\n\nTotal: 14 children + 7 parents = 21 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 56: Reducing Parents Further\n\nTo reduce the number of unique parents, perhaps some of the Q parents are the same as P parents.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Q1 is P4.\n\n- Q2 is P3.\n\n- Q3 is P2.\n\nSo, parents are P1, P2, P3, P4.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, P3, P4\n\nTotal: 14 children + 4 parents = 18 people, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 57: Further Overlapping Parents\n\nPerhaps some parents are parents to multiple sibling or cousin pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\n- P1 is a parent to A and B (sibling pair), and also to C and D (sibling pair).\n\n- P2 is a parent to A and B, and to E and F (sibling pair).\n\n- P3 is a parent to C and D, and to G and H (sibling pair).\n\n- P4 is a parent to E and F, and to G and H.\n\nBut this would make some children cousins to each other, which might not align with the given pairs.\n\n### Step 58: Considering a Central Parent\n\nMaybe there is one central parent who is a parent to multiple children, forming various sibling and cousin relationships.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\n### Step 59: Revisiting the Total Count\n\nGiven that every approach leads to more than 15 people, perhaps the problem has a different interpretation.\n\nMaybe some of the 15 people are not part of any sibling or cousin pairs.\n\nBut the problem says \"among them, there are 4 pairs of siblings and 3 pairs of cousins,\" which suggests that these pairs are part of the 15 people, but doesn't exclude others from having different roles.\n\n### Step 60: Considering That Some Parents Are Not Present\n\nIf some parents are not present at the gathering, then the number of unique parents present would be less than the total number of unique parents.\n\nBut the problem asks for \"unique parents present at the gathering.\"\n\nThis adds another variable, making it even more complex.\n\n### Step 61: Looking for a Pattern in the Numbers\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers:\n\n- 4 sibling pairs: 8 children, requiring 8 parents if no overlap.\n\n- 3 cousin pairs: 6 children, requiring 3 shared parents and 3 additional parents.\n\nTotal unique parents: 8 (from siblings) + 3 (shared in cousins) + 3 (additional in cousins) = 14.\n\nBut this is without considering overlaps.\n\nGiven that total people are 15, which is less than 14 children + 14 parents = 28, there must be significant overlap in parents.\n\n### Step 62: Assuming Overlapping Parents\n\nAssume that some parents are shared across multiple sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and P3 are parents of C and D (sibling pair).\n\n- P2 and P3 are parents of E and F (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of G and H (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and P4 are parents of I and J (cousin pair).\n\n- P2 and P4 are parents of K and L (cousin pair).\n\n- P3 and P4 are parents of M and N (cousin pair).\n\nNow, unique parents: P1, P2, P3, P4.\n\nTotal people: 14 children + 4 parents = 18, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 63: Reducing to 15 People\n\nTo have only 15 people, we need to reduce the number of unique parents and children.\n\nPerhaps some individuals are being double-counted.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the children are the same in different pairs.\n\nFor example, if A is in both a sibling pair and a cousin pair.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as it would require careful arrangement.\n\n### Step 64: Considering That Some Children Are in Multiple Pairs\n\nLet\u2019s assume that some children are in both sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A and B are siblings (parents P1 and P2).\n\n- A is also in a cousin pair with C (sharing parent P1).\n\n- B is in a cousin pair with D (sharing parent P2).\n\n- C and D are siblings (parents P1 and P2).\n\nWait, but if C and D are siblings with parents P1 and P2, then A and C are both siblings and cousins, which is confusing.\n\n### Step 65: Trying a Different Configuration\n\nLet\u2019s try a different configuration.\n\n- Sibling pairs:\n\n  - A and B: parents P1 and P2.\n\n  - C and D: parents P3 and P4.\n\n  - E and F: parents P5 and P6.\n\n  - G and H: parents P7 and P8.\n\n- Cousin pairs:\n\n  - I and J: share parent P1, parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\n  - K and L: share parent P3, parents P3 and Q3, P3 and Q4.\n\n  - M and N: share parent P5, parents P5 and Q5, P5 and Q6.\n\nNow, unique people:\n\n- Children: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N\n\n- Parents: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6\n\nTotal: 14 children + 14 parents = 28 people, which is too many.\n\n### Step 66: Sharing Parents Across Cousin Pairs\n\nLet\u2019s try to share parents across cousin pairs.\n\n- I and J: share parent P1, parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\n- K and L: share parent P1, parents P1 and Q3, P1 and Q4.\n\n- M and N: share parent P1, parents P1 and Q5, P1 and Q6.\n\nNow, unique parents: P1, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6.\n\nBut still, with 14 children + 7 parents = 21 people, more than 15.\n\n### Step 67: Considering That Some Q Parents Are the Same\n\nPerhaps some of the Q parents are the same.\n\nFor example:\n\n- I and J: share parent P1, parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\n- K and L: share parent P1, parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\n- M and N: share parent P1, parents P1 and Q1, P1 and Q2.\n\nNow, unique parents: P1, Q1, Q2.\n\nBut then, I, J, K, L, M, N all have parents P1, Q1, and Q2, which might not align with the distinct cousin pairs.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\n### Step 68: Reconsidering the Approach\n\nMaybe I should think differently.\n\nEach sibling pair requires 2 unique parents.\n\nEach cousin pair requires 1 shared parent and 1 additional parent.\n\nGiven that, the total number of unique parents can be calculated based on how these shares overlap.\n\nBut without specific information on overlaps, it's challenging.\n\n### Step 69: Looking for a Formula\n\nPerhaps there's a formula to calculate the number of unique parents based on the number of sibling and cousin pairs and the overlaps.\n\nBut I don't recall such a formula.\n\n### Step 70: Considering That Some Parents Are Present Multiple Times\n\nWait, perhaps some parents are present multiple times, but that doesn't make sense in terms of unique individuals.\n\n### Step 71: Trying to Find the Minimum Number of Parents\n\nTo minimize the number of unique parents, maximize the sharing of parents across sibling and cousin pairs.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of A and B (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and P3 are parents of C and D (sibling pair).\n\n- P2 and P3 are parents of E and F (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and P2 are parents of G and H (sibling pair).\n\n- P1 and P4 are parents of I and J (cousin pair).\n\n- P2 and P4 are parents of K and L (cousin pair).\n\n- P3 and P4 are parents of M and N (cousin pair).\n\nNow, unique parents: P1, P2, P3, P4.\n\nTotal people: 14 children + 4 parents = 18, still more than 15.\n\n### Step 72: Reducing the Number of Children\n\nPerhaps some children are the same in different pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A and B are siblings (parents P1 and P2).\n\n- A and C are cousins (A and C share parent P1).\n\n- B and D are cousins (B and D share parent P2).\n\n- C and D are siblings (parents P1 and P2).\n\nWait, but then C and D are both siblings and cousins to A and B, which is confusing.\n\n### Step 73: Considering That Some Children Have the Same Parents in Different Roles\n\nThis is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps it's better to accept that the problem is misstated or that there's a mistake in my approach.\n\n### Step 74: Considering That Some Parents Are Only Parents to Cousin Pairs\n\nMaybe some parents are only involved in cousin pairs and not in sibling pairs.\n\nBut that seems to complicate things further.\n\n### Step 75: Looking for a Different Perspective\n\nPerhaps instead of trying to count the parents based on the pairs, I should consider the entire family structure.\n\nBut without more information, that's not feasible.\n\n### Step 76: Considering the Problem Constraints Again\n\nWe have:\n\n- 15 people in total.\n\n- 4 pairs of siblings: 8 children, requiring 8 parents if no overlap.\n\n- 3 pairs of cousins: 6 children, requiring 3 shared parents and 3 additional parents.\n\nBut with overlaps, the total number of unique parents decreases.\n\n### Step 77: Accepting That the Problem Is Complex\n\nThis problem is more complex than it initially appears, involving intricate family relationships and overlaps.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I might need to make an educated guess.\n\n### Step 78: Making an Educated Guess\n\nGiven that each sibling pair requires 2 parents and each cousin pair requires 1 shared parent and 1 additional parent, and considering overlaps, a reasonable guess for the number of unique parents present at the gathering is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{6}"
