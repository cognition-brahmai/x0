        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a train traveling between two cities. It says the train takes 5 hours to travel at an average speed of 80 miles per hour. And then it asks, if the train's speed were increased by 20 miles per hour, how long would it take to travel between the two cities?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that time, speed, and distance are related by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, in this case, the distance between the two cities can be found using the initial speed and time.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Initial speed (\\(v_1\\)) = 80 mph\n\n- Initial time (\\(t_1\\)) = 5 hours\n\nSo, the distance (\\(d\\)) is:\n\n\\[ d = v_1 \\times t_1 = 80 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 5 \\, \\text{hours} = 400 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNow, the problem states that the train's speed is increased by 20 miles per hour. So, the new speed (\\(v_2\\)) is:\n\n\\[ v_2 = v_1 + 20 = 80 \\, \\text{mph} + 20 \\, \\text{mph} = 100 \\, \\text{mph} \\]\n\nThe question is asking for the new time (\\(t_2\\)) it would take to travel the same distance at this increased speed. Using the same formula:\n\n\\[ d = v_2 \\times t_2 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\(t_2\\):\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{d}{v_2} = \\frac{400 \\, \\text{miles}}{100 \\, \\text{mph}} = 4 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nSo, at the increased speed of 100 mph, it would take 4 hours to travel between the two cities.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe without calculating the distance explicitly. Let's see.\n\nWe know that time is inversely proportional to speed when distance is constant. So, we can set up a proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1} \\]\n\nBut actually, that should be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1} \\]\n\nWait, no. That's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, since distance is constant, we have:\n\n\\[ v_1 \\times t_1 = v_2 \\times t_2 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{v_1}{v_2} \\times t_1 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{80}{100} \\times 5 \\, \\text{hours} = 0.8 \\times 5 = 4 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe factors like acceleration or deceleration, but the problem seems to be focusing on average speed, so I think assuming constant speed or average speed is sufficient.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Here, both speed and time are in compatible units (miles per hour and hours), so that's fine.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, distance:\n\n\\[ d = 80 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 5 \\, \\text{hours} = 400 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nThen, new speed:\n\n\\[ v_2 = 80 + 20 = 100 \\, \\text{mph} \\]\n\nNew time:\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{400 \\, \\text{miles}}{100 \\, \\text{mph}} = 4 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the proportion:\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{80}{100} \\times 5 = 0.8 \\times 5 = 4 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think that's the solution. It would take 4 hours to travel between the two cities at the increased speed of 100 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
