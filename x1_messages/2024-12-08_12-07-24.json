Okay, let's start brainstorming.\n\nFirst, I know that \"sub\" is a prefix that often means \"under\" or \"below.\" So, a lot of these words probably relate to something being under or below something else.\n\nLet me think of some common words:\n\n1. Submarine - That's underwater, right?\n\n2. Submerge - To go under water.\n\n3. Subscribe - To receive regular issues of something.\n\n4. Subtitle - The title under another title, or translations below the dialogue in videos.\n\n5. Subtract - To take away a number from another.\n\n6. Subsequent - Coming after something else.\n\n7. Substandard - Below the standard.\n\n8. Substantial - Considerable in amount or value.\n\n9. Substantiate - To support with evidence.\n\n10. Subtle - Delicately subtle differences.\n\nHmm, that's a good start. Ten words. I need eleven more.\n\nLet me think of more words related to \"under\" or \"below.\"\n\n11. Subsoil - The layer of soil under the topsoil.\n\n12. Subterranean - Underground.\n\n13. Subconscious - Below the level of conscious awareness.\n\n14. Subculture - A group within a culture that has distinct practices or beliefs.\n\n15. Subdivision - A division under another division.\n\n16. Sublette - Wait, is that a word? I think it's a surname. Maybe not relevant.\n\n17. Sublet - To rent out part of a property that you already rent.\n\n18. Subliminal - Below the threshold of consciousness.\n\n19. Subpoena - A legal document requiring someone to appear in court.\n\n20. Subplot - A secondary plot in a story.\n\n21. Subsidize - To support with financial aid.\n\nOkay, that should be 21 words starting with \"sub.\" Let me just double-check:\n\n1. Submarine\n\n2. Submerge\n\n3. Subscribe\n\n4. Subtitle\n\n5. Subtract\n\n6. Subsequent\n\n7. Substandard\n\n8. Substantial\n\n9. Substantiate\n\n10. Subtle\n\n11. Subsoil\n\n12. Subterranean\n\n13. Subconscious\n\n14. Subculture\n\n15. Subdivision\n\n16. Sublet\n\n17. Subliminal\n\n18. Subpoena\n\n19. Subplot\n\n20. Subsidize\n\nWait, that's 20 words. What's another one?\n\n21. Submarine cable - A cable laid on the ocean floor for communications or power.\n\nYes, that should do it. Now, let's make sure none of them are duplicates or incorrect.\n\nSubmarine: correct.\n\nSubmerge: correct.\n\nSubscribe: correct.\n\nSubtitle: correct.\n\nSubtract: correct.\n\nSubsequent: correct.\n\nSubstandard: correct.\n\nSubstantial: correct.\n\nSubstantiate: correct.\n\nSubtle: correct.\n\nSubsoil: correct.\n\nSubterranean: correct.\n\nSubconscious: correct.\n\nSubculture: correct.\n\nSubdivision: correct.\n\nSublet: correct.\n\nSubliminal: correct.\n\nSubpoena: correct.\n\nSubplot: correct.\n\nSubsidize: correct.\n\nSubmarine cable: correct.\n\nAlright, I think this list is good. I hope this helps!\n\n**Final List:**\n\n1. Submarine\n\n2. Submerge\n\n3. Subscribe\n\n4. Subtitle\n\n5. Subtract\n\n6. Subsequent\n\n7. Substandard\n\n8. Substantial\n\n9. Substantiate\n\n10. Subtle\n\n11. Subsoil\n\n12. Subterranean\n\n13. Subconscious\n\n14. Subculture\n\n15. Subdivision\n\n16. Sublet\n\n17. Subliminal\n\n18. Subpoena\n\n19. Subplot\n\n20. Subsidize\n\n21.
