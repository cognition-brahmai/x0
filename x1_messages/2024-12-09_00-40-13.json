        "content": "In the great blue yonder, where the waves play and frolic,\nLives a group of dolphins, oh what a wondrous follicle!\nTheir skin so sleek and shiny, like a pearl in the sea,\nWith smiles that could light up the darkest of glee.\n\nNow, in this tale, we follow Finley, a dolphin both bright and bold,\nWho loved to explore, with tales to be told.\nOne day, while playing near the coral reef's edge,\nHe spotted something new, oh what a perfect pledge!\n\nIt was a glowing orb, bobbing in the tide,\nFinley swam closer, his curiosity did bide.\n\"Hello there!\" Finley squeaked, \"What might you be?\"\nThe orb blinked its light, as if trying to speak.\n\nFinley, being the friendly sort, decided to help,\nPerhaps it was lost, or in need of a fellowship.\nHe nudged it gently with his snout so fine,\nAnd off they went, on an adventure divine.\n\nThrough the ocean deep they swam, past schools of fish so grand,\nOver rocky outcrops, holding hands.\nThey danced with the jellyfish, under the moon's soft glow,\nAnd even played tag with a friendly shoal below.\n\nBut as the sun began to rise, painting the sky with hues so bright,\nFinley realized it was time to say goodnight.\n\"Friend Orb,\" he said, \"I must return home now,\nBut I'll never forget our adventure, somehow.\"\n\nThe orb blinked twice, as if saying, \"See you later, mate!\"\nAnd with a final splash, Finley swam away, elate.\n\nFrom that day on, Finley would often look for his friend,\nThough the orb never appeared again, their bond did extend.\nFor in the vast ocean, where wonders abound,\nFriendships are formed, and memories are found.\n\nSo remember, dear ones, whether on land or sea,\nAdventure awaits, just waiting for you and me.\nStay curious, stay kind, and always be true,\nFor in the end, that's what makes life brand new."
