        "content": "The term you're referring to is \"Pointillism.\" It's a technique in which artists use tiny dots or strokes of pure color that, when viewed from a distance, blend together in the viewer's eye to form a complete image. This method exploits the principle of optical mixing, where the colors are mixed visually rather than physically on the palette. Notable artists who employed this technique include Georges Seurat and Paul Signac."
