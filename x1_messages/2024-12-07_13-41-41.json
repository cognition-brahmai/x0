Kneading dough is a fundamental technique in bread making that helps develop the gluten proteins in the flour, which gives bread its structure and texture. It involves repeatedly folding and pressing the dough on a floured surface with the heels of your hands, then turning it and repeating the process for a specified amount of time. Many bakers find kneading therapeutic, as it's a physical and rhythmic activity that can be quite satisfying. The feel of the dough changing from rough and shaggy to smooth and elastic is a rewarding part of the bread-making process."
