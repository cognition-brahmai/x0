        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to understand what the factory is currently producing and then see how that changes with the increase in production rate.\n\nSo, the factory currently produces 1200 units in 8 hours. I need to find out the production rate per hour first. To do that, I'll divide the total units by the total hours.\n\nProduction rate = Total units / Total hours\nProduction rate = 1200 units / 8 hours\nProduction rate = 150 units per hour\n\nNow, the factory is increasing its production rate by 50%. So, I need to calculate what 50% of the current production rate is and then add that to the current production rate.\n\nIncrease in production rate = Current production rate * 50%\nIncrease in production rate = 150 units/hour * 0.5\nIncrease in production rate = 75 units per hour\n\nSo, the new production rate will be:\n\nNew production rate = Current production rate + Increase in production rate\nNew production rate = 150 units/hour + 75 units/hour\nNew production rate = 225 units per hour\n\nNow, we need to find out how many units the factory will produce in 10 hours at this new production rate.\n\nTotal units = New production rate * Total hours\nTotal units = 225 units/hour * 10 hours\nTotal units = 2250 units\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the original production is 1200 units in 8 hours, which is indeed 150 units per hour. Increasing that by 50% should be 150 plus 75, which is 225 units per hour. Then, producing at that rate for 10 hours should be 2250 units.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportions. If the factory was producing 1200 units in 8 hours, that's 1200 units per 8 hours. If they increase production by 50%, that's like multiplying the production rate by 1.5. So, the new production rate would be 1200 * 1.5 = 1800 units in 8 hours.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I calculated it differently. Maybe I need to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nIn the first approach, I calculated the per hour rate and then increased it by 50%. In the second approach, I directly increased the total production by 50%.\n\nI think the confusion is about what the 50% increase applies to. Does it apply to the total production in 8 hours, or to the hourly production rate?\n\nIf the 50% increase is on the total production in 8 hours, then the new total production in 8 hours would be 1200 * 1.5 = 1800 units. Then, to find out the production rate per hour, it would be 1800 units / 8 hours = 225 units per hour. Then, in 10 hours, it would be 225 units/hour * 10 hours = 2250 units.\n\nAlternatively, if the 50% increase is on the hourly production rate, then it's the same as the first approach.\n\nSo, both approaches actually lead to the same result, which is 2250 units in 10 hours.\n\nBut let's consider another way to look at it. If the factory increases its production rate by 50%, it means that for every hour, it produces 50% more units than before.\n\nSo, original production rate: 150 units/hour\nIncreased production rate: 150 + (150 * 0.5) = 225 units/hour\n\nThen, in 10 hours, it would be 225 units/hour * 10 hours = 2250 units.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of the total production, increasing by 50% means multiplying by 1.5, but that would be for the same time period. However, in this problem, the time period is changing from 8 hours to 10 hours.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the concept of proportionality. If production rate increases by 50%, and time increases from 8 hours to 10 hours, which is an increase by 25%, then the total production should increase by both factors.\n\nFirst, the production rate increases by 50%, and the time increases by 25%. So, the total production should increase by a factor of 1.5 (for the rate) times 1.25 (for the time).\n\nTotal increase factor = 1.5 * 1.25 = 1.875\n\nSo, the new total production would be the original production multiplied by this factor:\n\nTotal units = Original total units * Total increase factor\nTotal units = 1200 units * 1.875\nTotal units = 2250 units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the original production per hour, multiplied by the new number of hours, after increasing the production rate.\n\nOriginal production rate: 150 units/hour\nNew production rate: 150 * 1.5 = 225 units/hour\nTotal units in 10 hours: 225 * 10 = 2250 units\n\nAll these different approaches are leading me to the same answer, which is 2250 units.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. So, if the factory increases its production rate by 50% and operates for 10 hours, it will produce 2250 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2250} \\]"
