        "content": "Let's see. There are 48 people in total in this group. According to the problem, one-third of them wear glasses, one-fourth wear contact lenses, and the rest don't use any vision correction. I need to find out how many people don't use any vision correction.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many people wear glasses. Since one-third of the group wears glasses, I can calculate that by taking one-third of 48.\n\nOne-third of 48 is 48 divided by 3, which is 16. So, 16 people wear glasses.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many people wear contact lenses. The problem says one-fourth of them wear contact lenses. So, I'll calculate one-fourth of 48.\n\nOne-fourth of 48 is 48 divided by 4, which is 12. So, 12 people wear contact lenses.\n\nNow, to find out how many people don't use any vision correction, I need to subtract the number of people who wear glasses and those who wear contact lenses from the total number of people.\n\nSo, total people without vision correction = total people - (people with glasses + people with contact lenses).\n\nThat would be 48 - (16 + 12) = 48 - 28 = 20.\n\nTherefore, 20 people don't use any vision correction.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to find out the fraction of people who don't use any vision correction.\n\nWe know that one-third wear glasses and one-fourth wear contact lenses. So, the fraction of people who use some form of vision correction is one-third plus one-fourth.\n\nTo add one-third and one-fourth, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nSo, one-third is equal to 4 twelfths, and one-fourth is equal to 3 twelfths.\n\nAdding them up: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.\n\nSo, 7/12 of the people use some form of vision correction.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of people who don't use any vision correction is 1 - 7/12 = 5/12.\n\nNow, to find the number of people who don't use any vision correction, I can multiply this fraction by the total number of people.\n\nSo, 5/12 of 48 is (5/12) * 48.\n\nCalculating that: 5 times 48 divided by 12.\n\n48 divided by 12 is 4, and 5 times 4 is 20.\n\nAgain, I get 20 people.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with 20 people who don't use any vision correction.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
