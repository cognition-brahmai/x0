The average speed is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the total distance between the two cities is 360 miles, the first half of the journey is 180 miles and the second half is also 180 miles. The average speed for the first half is 60 mph, and for the second half, it is 90 mph.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time taken for each half of the journey.\n\nFor the first half:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_1 = \\frac{\\text{Distance}_1}{\\text{Speed}_1} = \\frac{180 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ mph}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFor the second half:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_2 = \\frac{\\text{Distance}_2}{\\text{Speed}_2} = \\frac{180 \\text{ miles}}{90 \\text{ mph}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, the total time for the entire trip is the sum of the times for both halves:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time}_1 + \\text{Time}_2 = 3 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance is 360 miles, as given.\n\nTherefore, the overall average speed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{360 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 72 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nSo, the overall average speed for the entire trip is 72 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
