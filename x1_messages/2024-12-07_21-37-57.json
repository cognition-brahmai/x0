Some of these words are not standard English and might be considered non-words or placeholders, but for the sake of the exercise, I've used them to maintain the structure and flow of the sonnet. The themes of nature, particularly weather and elements, seem to fit well with the consonant-heavy language, suggesting a harsh or elemental quality."
