        "content": "In electrical engineering, the term for the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied is called \"impedance.\" So, the correct answer is C. Impedance.\n\nTo provide a bit more detail, impedance is a measure that extends the concept of resistance to AC circuits, where capacitors and inductors are also present. While resistance (option A) is the opposition to current flow in DC circuits and is purely real, impedance includes both resistance and reactance, which accounts for the effects of capacitance (option B) and inductance (option D).\n\nCapacitance is the property of a component that stores energy in an electric field, and inductance is the property that stores energy in a magnetic field. In AC circuits, these components cause the current and voltage to be out of phase, which is accounted for in the impedance.\n\nSo, impedance is the total opposition to current flow in an AC circuit, encompassing both resistive and reactive components.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
