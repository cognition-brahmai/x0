        "content": "So I have this problem here. There are 100 people in a group, and among them, 65 like chocolate ice cream, 40 like vanilla ice cream, and 20 like both chocolate and vanilla. I need to find out how many people don't like either chocolate or vanilla ice cream.\n\nOkay, let's see. This seems like a problem that can be solved using set theory, specifically with Venn diagrams. I can think of the people who like chocolate as one set and those who like vanilla as another set. The overlap between these two sets is the people who like both.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Let C be the set of people who like chocolate ice cream.\n\n- Let V be the set of people who like vanilla ice cream.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- The total number of people is 100.\n\n- The number of people who like chocolate, which is the cardinality of set C, |C| = 65.\n\n- The number of people who like vanilla, which is the cardinality of set V, |V| = 40.\n\n- The number of people who like both chocolate and vanilla, which is the intersection of sets C and V, |C \u2229 V| = 20.\n\nWe need to find the number of people who don't like either chocolate or vanilla ice cream. In other words, we need to find the number of people who are not in set C or set V. That is, the complement of the union of C and V, which can be denoted as |C \u222a V|c.\n\nBut since the total number of people is 100, the number of people who don't like either flavor is 100 minus the number of people who like either chocolate or vanilla or both. So, it's 100 - |C \u222a V|.\n\nNow, to find |C \u222a V|, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|C \u222a V| = |C| + |V| - |C \u2229 V|\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n|C \u222a V| = 65 + 40 - 20 = 85\n\nSo, 85 people like either chocolate or vanilla or both.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who don't like either flavor is:\n\n100 - 85 = 15\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nLet's visualize this with a Venn diagram. We have two circles overlapping. The overlap represents people who like both chocolate and vanilla, which is 20 people.\n\nThe part of the chocolate circle that doesn't overlap with vanilla should be 65 - 20 = 45 people, who like only chocolate.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the vanilla circle that doesn't overlap with chocolate is 40 - 20 = 20 people, who like only vanilla.\n\nSo, the total number of people who like either chocolate or vanilla or both is:\n\nOnly chocolate: 45\n\nOnly vanilla: 20\n\nBoth: 20\n\nTotal: 45 + 20 + 20 = 85\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who don't like either flavor is 100 - 85 = 15.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother method could be to use the formula for the complement:\n\n|C \u222a V|c = total - |C \u222a V|\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of probabilities, but since this is a finite group, set theory seems more appropriate.\n\nWait, or perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion in a different way.\n\nLet me see: inclusion-exclusion applies to more than two sets as well, but here we only have two sets.\n\nIs there any chance I missed some people in my calculation?\n\nLet me check the numbers again:\n\n- Only chocolate: 65 - 20 = 45\n\n- Only vanilla: 40 - 20 = 20\n\n- Both: 20\n\n- Neither: ?\n\nTotal: 45 + 20 + 20 = 85\n\nNeither: 100 - 85 = 15\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the number of people who like at least one of the flavors, which is |C \u222a V| = 85, and subtract that from the total to find those who like neither.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nSo, the answer should be 15 people don't like either chocolate or vanilla ice cream.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
