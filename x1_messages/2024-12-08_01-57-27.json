        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about balls in a box. There are red, blue, and green balls, and I'm given some ratios between them. The ratio of red balls to blue balls is 3:4, and the ratio of blue balls to green balls is 2:5. I need to find the ratio of red balls to green balls.\n\nOkay, so ratios can be a bit tricky, but if I break it down step by step, I should be able to figure this out.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, when it says the ratio of red to blue is 3:4, that means for every 3 red balls, there are 4 blue balls. Similarly, the ratio of blue to green is 2:5, meaning for every 2 blue balls, there are 5 green balls.\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of red to green balls. But these are connected through blue balls, since both ratios involve blue balls.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find a common term for blue balls in both ratios so that I can link them together.\n\nLet's look at the ratios again:\n\n- Red : Blue = 3 : 4\n\n- Blue : Green = 2 : 5\n\nThe problem is that the number of blue balls in the first ratio is 4, and in the second ratio, it's 2. To combine these ratios, I need the number of blue balls to be the same in both ratios.\n\nSo, I can find a common multiple of 4 and 2, which is 4.\n\nLet's adjust the second ratio so that the number of blue balls is 4.\n\nThe original second ratio is Blue : Green = 2 : 5.\n\nTo make blue balls 4, I can multiply both terms by 2.\n\nSo, Blue : Green = (2*2) : (5*2) = 4 : 10.\n\nNow, both ratios have the same number of blue balls:\n\n- Red : Blue = 3 : 4\n\n- Blue : Green = 4 : 10\n\nSince the number of blue balls is the same in both ratios, I can combine them directly.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of Red : Blue : Green = 3 : 4 : 10.\n\nNow, the question asks for the ratio of red balls to green balls, which is Red : Green = 3 : 10.\n\nSo, the ratio of red balls to green balls is 3:10.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this?\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of multiplying ratios.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Red / Blue = 3 / 4\n\n- Blue / Green = 2 / 5\n\nTo find Red / Green, I can multiply these two ratios, but I need to make sure that the blue terms cancel out.\n\nSo, (Red / Blue) * (Blue / Green) = (Red * Blue) / (Blue * Green) = Red / Green.\n\nWait, but in this case, Red / Green = (3/4) * (2/5) = (3*2) / (4*5) = 6 / 20 = 3 / 10.\n\nSo, again, the ratio of red to green balls is 3:10.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier by combining the ratios directly.\n\nLet me try another approach to double-check.\n\nSuppose I let the number of blue balls be a variable, say B.\n\nThen, from the first ratio, Red / Blue = 3 / 4, so Red = (3/4) * B.\n\nFrom the second ratio, Blue / Green = 2 / 5, so Green = (5/2) * B.\n\nNow, the ratio of Red to Green is Red / Green = (3/4 * B) / (5/2 * B) = (3/4) / (5/2) = (3/4) * (2/5) = 6/20 = 3/10.\n\nAgain, the ratio is 3:10.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of actual numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 4 blue balls (since the first ratio has blue as 4).\n\nThen, Red = 3 (from Red:Blue = 3:4).\n\nFrom the second ratio, Blue:Green = 2:5.\n\nIf Blue = 4, then Green = (5/2) * 4 = 10.\n\nSo, Red = 3, Green = 10, hence Red:Green = 3:10.\n\nYet another way: Using the concept of equivalent ratios.\n\nGiven Red:Blue = 3:4 and Blue:Green = 2:5.\n\nTo combine them, I need to express both ratios with the same Blue value.\n\nAs before, make Blue = 4 in both.\n\nSo, Red:Blue = 3:4 remains the same.\n\nBlue:Green = 2:5 can be scaled to 4:10.\n\nTherefore, Red:Blue:Green = 3:4:10, and Red:Green = 3:10.\n\nEverything points to the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the ratio of red balls to green balls is 3:10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:10} \\]"
