        "content": "Let's see here. So, we have a train that travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 5 hours to go between two cities. Now, if it had traveled at 80 miles per hour instead, how long would that take?\n\nFirst, I need to find out the distance between the two cities. Since the train goes at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, I can calculate the distance by multiplying speed by time. So, distance equals speed times time, right? That would be 60 miles per hour times 5 hours, which is 300 miles.\n\nNow, if the train travels at 80 miles per hour, and the distance is still 300 miles, I need to find out the time it would take. Time equals distance divided by speed, I think. So, time equals 300 miles divided by 80 miles per hour. Let me do that calculation.\n\n300 divided by 80. Well, 80 times 3 is 240, and then 300 minus 240 is 60. So, it's 3 hours plus 60 miles divided by 80 miles per hour. 60 divided by 80 is 0.75, so that's 3.75 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should check that. Alternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportions. If the speed increases, the time should decrease proportionally. So, the original speed is 60 mph, and the new speed is 80 mph. The ratio of the speeds is 60:80, which simplifies to 3:4.\n\nSince time is inversely proportional to speed when distance is constant, the time ratio should be inversely proportional. So, if speed increases by a factor of 4/3, time should decrease by a factor of 3/4.\n\nOriginal time is 5 hours. So, new time should be 5 hours multiplied by 3/4, which is 3.75 hours.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same result I got earlier. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula time equals distance over speed. We already found the distance is 300 miles, and the new speed is 80 mph, so time is 300 divided by 80, which is 3.75 hours.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I can convert the speed to miles per minute and see.\n\n60 miles per hour is 1 mile per minute. In 5 hours, that's 300 miles, which matches what I had before.\n\nNow, 80 miles per hour is 80 miles per 60 minutes, which is 4/3 miles per minute. So, to travel 300 miles at 4/3 miles per minute, the time would be 300 divided by 4/3, which is 300 times 3/4, which is 225 minutes.\n\nWait, but 225 minutes is 3.75 hours, since 60 minutes times 3 is 180 minutes, and 225 minus 180 is 45 minutes, which is 0.75 of an hour. So, again, 3.75 hours.\n\nI think that's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.75 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
