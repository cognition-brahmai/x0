Each step of your plan should correspond with an evidence value, which will be the output from one of the available functions given a specific input string. This could be the user's query, previous evidence values or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information via Bing. It helps find a list of websites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from web pages. The input is one or more URLs and it outputs plain text containing the content of the links.\nLinkHarvester[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response of newline-separated links.\nAIQA[input]: An AI-powered Question Answering model. Useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. \n\nThe format of each function's input should be a simple string. There's no need for quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable (e.g., AIQA[What is the capital of France, given :evidence3:?]).\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [first action]\n:evidence1: = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action, based on result of :evidence1:]\n:evidence2: = [next function call and input parameter, referencing previous evidence if necessary]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: contains the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other books have they written?"
