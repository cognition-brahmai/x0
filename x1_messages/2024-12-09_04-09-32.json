        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a group of 10 friends who want to split the cost of a $2000 vacation package. But there's a twist: two of these friends can only afford to pay half as much as the other eight friends. So, we need to figure out how much each friend has to pay, taking this into account.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say that each of the eight friends who can pay the full amount will pay an amount we'll call \"x.\" Then, each of the two friends who can only pay half as much will pay \"x/2.\"\n\nNow, since there are eight friends paying \"x\" each, their total contribution will be 8x. The two friends paying half as much will contribute 2*(x/2), which simplifies to x.\n\nSo, the total amount collected from all friends will be 8x + x, which equals 9x.\n\nWe know that the total cost of the vacation package is $2000, so we can set up the equation:\n\n9x = 2000\n\nNow, to find the value of x, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 9:\n\nx = 2000 / 9\n\nCalculating that, x equals approximately 222.222..., or more precisely, 222.22 when rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nSo, each of the eight friends will pay $222.22.\n\nNow, the two friends who can only pay half as much will each pay x/2, which is 222.22 / 2 = $111.11.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that everything adds up correctly.\n\nIf eight friends pay $222.22 each, that's 8 * 222.22 = $1777.76.\n\nTwo friends pay $111.11 each, which is 2 * 111.11 = $222.22.\n\nAdding those together, 1777.76 + 222.22 = $2000.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Each of the eight friends pays $222.22.\n\n- Each of the two friends pays $111.11.\n\nTotaling $2000.\n\nI think that's the correct distribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{222.22 \\text{ and } 111.11} \\]"
