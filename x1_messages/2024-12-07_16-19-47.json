        "content": "So there are 8 people in a room, and everyone shakes hands with each other exactly once. We need to find out how many handshakes happen in total. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that in situations like this, where every person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, it's a problem about combinations. Specifically, it's about finding out how many unique pairs of people can be formed from the group, because each pair corresponds to one handshake.\n\nSo, the number of handshakes should be equal to the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 8, without regard to order. That sounds like a combination problem.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items, and \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 8\\) and \\(k = 2\\), since we're choosing 2 people out of 8 to shake hands.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can simplify this. Since \\(8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6!\\), and the \\(6!\\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, there should be 28 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for 8 people:\n\n- The first person shakes hands with 7 others.\n\n- The second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 6 remaining people.\n\n- The third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 5 remaining people.\n\n- And so on, until the seventh person shakes hands with the eighth person.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n\\[\n7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 28\n\\]\n\nAgain, 28 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each person shaking hands with every other person, which is equivalent to the number of edges in a complete graph with 8 vertices. In graph theory, the number of edges in a complete graph with \\(n\\) vertices is given by \\(C(n, 2)\\), which again is 28 for \\(n = 8\\).\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead me to the same answer: there are 28 handshakes.\n\nBut the question mentions Tim and Sally specifically. Do they have any special role in this problem? Probably not; it's just to specify that there are 8 people, including these two.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if Tim and Sally shaking hands is one of those 28 handshakes. Yes, it is. So, the total remains 28.\n\nI think that's correct. The answer should be 28 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
