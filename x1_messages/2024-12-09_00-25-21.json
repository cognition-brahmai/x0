        "content": "So there's this problem where there are 10 people standing in a circle, and every second person is eliminated going clockwise until only one person is left. The question is, where should you stand initially to be the last one remaining.\n\nThis sounds like a classic problem known as the Josephus problem. I've heard of it before, but I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me try to recall how to approach this.\n\nIn the Josephus problem, people are standing in a circle, and every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. In this case, k is 2 because every second person is eliminated.\n\nI think there's a mathematical way to solve this without having to simulate the entire process, especially since with 10 people, it's manageable, but it's good to know a general method.\n\nLet me see. I remember that for the Josephus problem, there's a recursive formula or maybe a direct formula that can be used to find the safe position.\n\nLet's consider the general case where there are n people, and every k-th person is eliminated.\n\nBut in this specific problem, k is 2, so maybe there's a simpler pattern or formula when k is 2.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern by solving for smaller values of n and see if I can find a pattern or a formula that applies to n=10.\n\nLet's start with n=1:\n\nIf there's only one person, no one is eliminated, so person 1 remains.\n\nn=1: position 1\n\nn=2:\n\nPerson 1 eliminates person 2, then only person 1 is left.\n\nn=2: position 1\n\nn=3:\n\nPerson 1 eliminates person 2, then person 3 eliminates person 1, so person 3 remains.\n\nn=3: position 3\n\nn=4:\n\nPerson 1 eliminates person 2, person 3 eliminates person 4, then person 1 eliminates person 3, so person 1 remains.\n\nn=4: position 1\n\nn=5:\n\n1 eliminates 2, 3 eliminates 4, 5 eliminates 1, 3 eliminates 5, so person 3 remains.\n\nn=5: position 3\n\nn=6:\n\n1 eliminates 2, 3 eliminates 4, 5 eliminates 6, 1 eliminates 3, 5 eliminates 1, so person 5 remains.\n\nn=6: position 5\n\nn=7:\n\n1 eliminates 2, 3 eliminates 4, 5 eliminates 6, 7 eliminates 1, 3 eliminates 5, 7 eliminates 3, so person 7 remains.\n\nn=7: position 7\n\nn=8:\n\n1 eliminates 2, 3 eliminates 4, 5 eliminates 6, 7 eliminates 8, 1 eliminates 3, 5 eliminates 7, 1 eliminates 5, so person 1 remains.\n\nn=8: position 1\n\nn=9:\n\n1 eliminates 2, 3 eliminates 4, 5 eliminates 6, 7 eliminates 8, 9 eliminates 1, 3 eliminates 5, 7 eliminates 9, 3 eliminates 7, so person 3 remains.\n\nn=9: position 3\n\nn=10:\n\n1 eliminates 2, 3 eliminates 4, 5 eliminates 6, 7 eliminates 8, 9 eliminates 10, 1 eliminates 3, 5 eliminates 7, 9 eliminates 1, 5 eliminates 9, so person 5 remains.\n\nn=10: position 5\n\nWait, but let's double-check that:\n\nStart with positions: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\n1 eliminates 2, now remaining: 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\n3 eliminates 4, remaining: 1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\n5 eliminates 6, remaining: 1,3,5,7,8,9,10\n\n7 eliminates 8, remaining: 1,3,5,7,9,10\n\n9 eliminates 10, remaining: 1,3,5,7,9\n\n1 eliminates 3, remaining: 1,5,7,9\n\n5 eliminates 7, remaining: 1,5,9\n\n9 eliminates 1, remaining: 5,9\n\n5 eliminates 9, so person 5 remains.\n\nYes, for n=10, position 5 is the last one remaining.\n\nBut is there a pattern or formula that can directly give us the position for any n when k=2?\n\nLooking back at the results:\n\nn=1: 1\n\nn=2: 1\n\nn=3: 3\n\nn=4: 1\n\nn=5: 3\n\nn=6: 5\n\nn=7: 7\n\nn=8: 1\n\nn=9: 3\n\nn=10: 5\n\nI notice that for powers of 2, the surviving position is 1. For example, n=1 (2^0), n=2 (2^1), n=4 (2^2), n=8 (2^3), the surviving position is 1.\n\nBetween these, the surviving position increases by 2 each time.\n\nWait, maybe it's related to the binary representation of n or something.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula.\n\nI recall that for the Josephus problem with k=2, the surviving position can be found using the formula:\n\nj(n) = 2*l + 1, where n = 2^m + l, and l < 2^m.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I think it's j(n) = 2*(n - 2^m) + 1, where 2^m is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=10.\n\nFirst, find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10, which is 8 (2^3).\n\nThen, l = n - 2^m = 10 - 8 = 2.\n\nThen, j(n) = 2*2 + 1 = 5.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier result where for n=10, position 5 remains.\n\nLet's test this formula with n=3.\n\nLargest power of 2 less than or equal to 3 is 2 (2^1).\n\nl = 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nj(n) = 2*1 + 1 = 3.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nAnother test: n=7.\n\nLargest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is 4 (2^2).\n\nl = 7 - 4 = 3.\n\nj(n) = 2*3 + 1 = 7.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nn=9.\n\nLargest power of 2 less than or equal to 9 is 8 (2^3).\n\nl = 9 - 8 = 1.\n\nj(n) = 2*1 + 1 = 3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nn=6.\n\nLargest power of 2 less than or equal to 6 is 4 (2^2).\n\nl = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nj(n) = 2*2 + 1 = 5.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nPerfect. So the formula is j(n) = 2*l + 1, where l = n - 2^m, and 2^m is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n.\n\nSo, for n=10:\n\n2^m <= 10, largest m is 3, since 2^3=8.\n\nl = 10 - 8 = 2.\n\nj(n) = 2*2 + 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, to be the last one remaining with 10 people and eliminating every second person, you should stand in position 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
