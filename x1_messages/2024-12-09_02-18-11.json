She was an American dancer who is often considered the \"Mother of Modern Dance.\" In the early 20th century, Duncan rebelled against the rigid techniques of classical ballet and developed her own style, which emphasized natural movements inspired by ancient Greek arts, folk dances, and nature. Her approach laid the foundation for modern dance as we know it today."
