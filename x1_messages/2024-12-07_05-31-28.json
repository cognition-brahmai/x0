        "content": "To address the user's request to find all documents related to \"climate change\" within the last five years, I need to select the most appropriate function from the available options: `pdf_search` and `text_analysis`. Given the nature of the query, which involves locating specific information within documents based on keywords and a date range, `pdf_search` seems to be the more suitable function.\n\nThe user's input specifies the need to find documents related to \"climate change\" from the past five years. Therefore, the parameters to be used in the `pdf_search` function should include the keywords \"climate change\" and a date range\u9650\u5b9a\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u3002\n\nTo determine the exact date range, I need to calculate the start and end dates based on the current date. Assuming today's date is dynamic, I'll represent it as `current_date`. The start date should be five years before the current date, and the end date should be the current date.\n\nHowever, since I don't have the actual current date, I'll represent the date range in a general format that can be interpreted accordingly.\n\nThus, the function and parameters to be used are:\n\n- Function: `pdf_search`\n\n- Parameters:\n\n  - keywords: [\"climate change\"]\n\n  - date_range:\n\n    - start: current_date - 5 years\n\n    - end: current_date\n\nIn JSON format, this would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"pdf_search\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"keywords\": [\"climate change\"],\n    \"date_range\": {\n      \"start\": \"current_date - 5 years\",\n      \"end\": \"current_date\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis selection is based on the assumption that `pdf_search` is capable of handling date ranges and searching within PDF files for specific keywords. If there are other considerations or if the `text_analysis` function could also be relevant, further evaluation would be needed. But given the straightforward nature of the request, `pdf_search` appears to be the most direct solution.\n"
