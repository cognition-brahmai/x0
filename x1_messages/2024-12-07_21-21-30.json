Over time, it spread to other parts of the world and evolved into the version we know today. The objective remains the same: to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under threat of capture (\"check\") in such a way that there is no legal move to remove the threat. It's a game that requires deep strategic thinking and planning ahead, making it a favorite among intellectuals and hobbyists alike."
