(pauses, staring off into the distance) It's like nothing you've ever seen, precious. Smooth, shiny, and oh so precious.\n\nI found it in the dark tunnels, deep down where no light ever reaches. I was searching, crawling on my hands and knees, when I felt something different under my fingers. I picked it up, and there it was, gleaming in the dim light of my torch. Oh, it was love at first sight, precious. Yes, love.\n\nIt's not big, no, not like some rocks you might find on the surface. It's small, fits perfectly in the palm of my hand. But what it lacks in size, it makes up for in beauty. The way it catches the light, even in the darkest places, it's almost like it has its own light, precious.\n\nI often talk to it, you know. Yes, I talk to my favorite rock. It's my friend, my companion in the dark. It doesn't judge me, it doesn't ask for anything in return. It just sits there, listening, or so I like to think.\n\nSometimes, when I'm really lonely, I hold it close to my chest, and I feel a warmth spread through me. It's like it's giving me strength, precious. Maybe it is, who knows? Rocks have secrets, deep within them, older than time itself.\n\nI've tried to show it to others, but they don't understand. They look at it and see just a rock, nothing special. But they're wrong, so wrong. They can't see its true beauty, because they don't look with the right eyes.\n\nI keep it hidden, most of the time. Hidden deep within my pocket, wrapped in cloth to protect it from prying eyes. I don't want anyone to take it away from me. It's mine, mine, mine!\n\nSometimes, in the dead of night, when everything is quiet, I take it out and admire it. I trace its contours with my fingers, feeling every groove and curve. It's like a part of me, precious. A part that I can't live without.\n\nIf someone were to ask me about my favorite rock, I'd have to tell them, it's more than just a rock to me. It's a companion, a friend, a source of comfort and strength. It's my precious.\n\nYes, my precious rock. (pauses, smiling slightly) My precious."
