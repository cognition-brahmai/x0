        "content": "So there are 12 apples and 18 oranges in the basket, right? That means there are a total of 12 plus 18, which is 30 fruits altogether.\n\nNow, if I pick one fruit at random, the probability that it's an apple should be the number of apples divided by the total number of fruits. So that would be 12 divided by 30.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. Both 12 and 30 can be divided by 6. So 12 divided by 6 is 2, and 30 divided by 6 is 5. So the simplified fraction is 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, which is 40%. So there's a 40% chance of picking an apple.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the format, I can probably leave it as a fraction. So the probability is 2/5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I should consider whether the fruits are equally likely to be picked. The problem says \"randomly pick one fruit,\" so I assume each fruit has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nAlso, there's no mention of any fruit being removed or anything like that. It's a straightforward probability problem.\n\nSo, yes, the probability should be the number of apples divided by the total number of fruits, which is 12/30, simplified to 2/5.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
