        "content": "So I've got this expression to simplify: (3x\u00b2y\u00b3)\u00b2 * (2xy\u00b2)\u00b3. Alright, let's break this down step by step. I need to remember my exponent rules here.\n\nFirst, I see that there are exponents being raised to other exponents, like (3x\u00b2y\u00b3)\u00b2. I know that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply the exponents. So, for something like (a^m)^n, it becomes a^(m*n). Also, I need to remember that the exponent applies to every factor inside the parentheses.\n\nSo, starting with (3x\u00b2y\u00b3)\u00b2, I'll apply the exponent of 2 to each part inside the parentheses:\n\n- 3\u00b2 is 9.\n\n- (x\u00b2)^2 is x^(2*2) = x^4.\n\n- (y\u00b3)^2 is y^(3*2) = y^6.\n\nSo, (3x\u00b2y\u00b3)\u00b2 becomes 9x^4y^6.\n\nNext, I have (2xy\u00b2)\u00b3. Again, I'll apply the exponent of 3 to each part inside the parentheses:\n\n- 2\u00b3 is 8.\n\n- x^1 raised to the 3rd power is x^(1*3) = x^3.\n\n- (y\u00b2)^3 is y^(2*3) = y^6.\n\nSo, (2xy\u00b2)\u00b3 becomes 8x^3y^6.\n\nNow, I need to multiply these two results together: 9x^4y^6 * 8x^3y^6.\n\nWhen multiplying terms with exponents, I multiply the coefficients and add the exponents for like bases.\n\nFirst, multiply the coefficients: 9 * 8 = 72.\n\nNext, for x, I have x^4 * x^3. Since the bases are the same, I add the exponents: 4 + 3 = 7. So, x^7.\n\nSimilarly, for y, I have y^6 * y^6. Again, add the exponents: 6 + 6 = 12. So, y^12.\n\nPutting it all together, the simplified expression is 72x^7y^12.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't miss anything. Starting with (3x\u00b2y\u00b3)\u00b2, I correctly applied the exponent to each part, getting 9x^4y^6. Then, for (2xy\u00b2)\u00b3, I got 8x^3y^6. Multiplying these, I multiplied the coefficients (9*8=72) and added the exponents for like bases (x^4*x^3=x^7 and y^6*y^6=y^12). Everything seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72x^7y^{12}} \\]"
