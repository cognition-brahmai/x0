        "content": "Implementing a tic-tac-toe game with an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm in Python involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide and the corresponding code to achieve this.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Game Board\n\nFirst, we need to represent the tic-tac-toe board. A simple list of lists can be used where each cell can be 'X', 'O', or empty.\n\n### Step 2: Display the Board\n\nWe need a function to print the current state of the board in a user-friendly format.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Winner\n\nImplement a function to check if there is a winner. This involves checking rows, columns, and diagonals.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Draw\n\nImplement a function to check if the game is a draw, meaning all cells are filled and there is no winner.\n\n### Step 5: Minimax Algorithm\n\nImplement the minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the AI. This algorithm evaluates all possible moves and selects the one that maximizes the chances of winning.\n\n### Step 6: Make Moves\n\nImplement functions to allow both the player and the AI to make moves on the board.\n\n### Step 7: Main Game Loop\n\nCreate the main game loop that alternates between the player's move and the AI's move until there is a winner or a draw.\n\n### Final Solution\n\n```python\ndef draw_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(\" | \".join(row))\n        print(\"-\" * 5)\n\ndef check_winner(board, player):\n    # Check rows\n    for row in board:\n        if all(cell == player for cell in row):\n            return True\n    # Check columns\n    for col in range(3):\n        if all(board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)):\n            return True\n    # Check diagonals\n    if all(board[i][i] == player for i in range(3)):\n        return True\n    if all(board[i][2 - i] == player for i in range(3)):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef check_draw(board):\n    return all(board[row][col] != ' ' for row in range(3) for col in range(3))\n\ndef minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing):\n    if check_winner(board, 'O'):\n        return 1\n    if check_winner(board, 'X'):\n        return -1\n    if check_draw(board):\n        return 0\n\n    if is_maximizing:\n        best_score = -float('inf')\n        for row in range(3):\n            for col in range(3):\n                if board[row][col] == ' ':\n                    board[row][col] = 'O'\n                    score = minimax(board, depth + 1, False)\n                    board[row][col] = ' '\n                    best_score = max(score, best_score)\n        return best_score\n    else:\n        best_score = float('inf')\n        for row in range(3):\n            for col in range(3):\n                if board[row][col] == ' ':\n                    board[row][col] = 'X'\n                    score = minimax(board, depth + 1, True)\n                    board[row][col] = ' '\n                    best_score = min(score, best_score)\n        return best_score\n\ndef ai_move(board):\n    best_score = -float('inf')\n    move = None\n    for row in range(3):\n        for col in range(3):\n            if board[row][col] == ' ':\n                board[row][col] = 'O'\n                score = minimax(board, 0, False)\n                board[row][col] = ' '\n                if score > best_score:\n                    best_score = score\n                    move = (row, col)\n    board[move[0]][move[1]] = 'O'\n\ndef main():\n    board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    current_player = 'X'\n\n    while True:\n        draw_board(board)\n        if current_player == 'X':\n            row = int(input(\"Enter row (0, 1, 2): \"))\n            col = int(input(\"Enter column (0, 1, 2): \"))\n            if board[row][col] != ' ':\n                print(\"Cell already occupied.
