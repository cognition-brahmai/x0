        "content": "Sure! Here's a simple function in JavaScript that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the built-in sort function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sortArrayAscending(arr) {\n  return arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing an array of integers as an argument, like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst myArray = [5, 3, 9, 1, 10];\nconst sortedArray = sortArrayAscending(myArray);\nconsole.log(sortedArray); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 9, 10]\n```\n\nThis function works by utilizing the `sort` method available on JavaScript arrays. By default, the `sort` method sorts elements as strings, which can lead to incorrect ordering for numbers (for example, `10` would come before `2` because `'10'` is lexicographically smaller than `'2'`). To sort numbers correctly, we provide a comparison function `(a, b) => a - b`, which ensures that the array is sorted in numerical order rather than lexicographical order.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further explanation, feel free to ask!"
