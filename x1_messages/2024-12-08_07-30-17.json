        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells two types of toys: cars and dolls. Each car costs $15, and each doll costs $10. A customer buys a total of 20 toys and spends exactly $250. We need to find out how many cars and dolls they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of cars bought.\n\n- Let \\( d \\) represent the number of dolls bought.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of toys bought is 20.\n\n2. The total amount spent is $250.\n\nWe can translate these into two equations based on the given information.\n\nFrom the first point, since the total number of toys is 20, we have:\n\n\\[ c + d = 20 \\]\n\nFrom the second point, the total cost of the cars and dolls is $250. Since each car costs $15 and each doll costs $10, we can write:\n\n\\[ 15c + 10d = 250 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( c + d = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( 15c + 10d = 250 \\)\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( c \\) and \\( d \\).\n\nOne way to solve this system is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for one of the variables, say \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ c = 20 - d \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( c \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 15(20 - d) + 10d = 250 \\]\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 20 - 15d + 10d = 250 \\]\n\n\\[ 300 - 15d + 10d = 250 \\]\n\n\\[ 300 - 5d = 250 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 300 from both sides:\n\n\\[ -5d = 250 - 300 \\]\n\n\\[ -5d = -50 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{-50}{-5} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the number of dolls bought is 10.\n\nNow, substitute \\( d = 10 \\) back into the equation \\( c = 20 - d \\):\n\n\\[ c = 20 - 10 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 10 cars and 10 dolls.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they bought 10 cars at $15 each, that's:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 15 = 150 \\]\n\nAnd 10 dolls at $10 each:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\]\n\nAdding those up:\n\n\\[ 150 + 100 = 250 \\]\n\nWhich matches the total amount spent. Also, the total number of toys is \\( 10 + 10 = 20 \\), which matches the given total.\n\nSo, the solution is 10 cars and 10 dolls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ cars and } 10 \\text{ dolls}} \\]"
