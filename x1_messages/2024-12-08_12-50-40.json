        "content": "I believe the author you're referring to is Edgar Allan Poe. He was a 19th-century American writer known for his works in the genre of dark romanticism, which often explored themes of death, loss, and the macabre. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is indeed one of his famous short stories, and \"The Raven\" is a renowned poem that has become an iconic piece of American literature. Both works are celebrated for their psychological depth and intricate use of symbolism. Edgar Allan Poe's contributions to literature have had a lasting impact, influencing not only American but also international literature, particularly in the realms of mystery and the supernatural."
