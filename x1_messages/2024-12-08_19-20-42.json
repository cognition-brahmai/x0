        "content": "So I've got this probability question here. It's about flipping a fair coin three times, and I need to find the probability of getting heads on the first flip, tails on the second flip, and heads on the third flip. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, since it's a fair coin, that means each flip is independent, and the probability of getting heads or tails on any single flip is 1/2.\n\nSo, the sequence we're looking for is Heads, Tails, Heads (H, T, H).\n\nBecause each flip is independent, the probability of getting this specific sequence is the product of the probabilities of each individual outcome.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(H, T, H) = P(H) * P(T) * P(H)\n\nSince P(H) = 1/2 and P(T) = 1/2, plugging in the values:\n\nP(H, T, H) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\nSo, the probability should be 1/8.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using combinations or something else?\n\nWell, since we're looking for a specific sequence, and the flips are independent, the combination formula isn't necessary here. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, but in this case, the order matters perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times. Each flip has 2 outcomes, so total outcomes are 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow, only one of these outcomes is the specific sequence H, T, H.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 (for the desired outcome) divided by 8 (total possible outcomes), which again gives 1/8.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. But to be thorough, let's list out all possible outcomes to visualize it:\n\n1. H, H, H\n\n2. H, H, T\n\n3. H, T, H\n\n4. H, T, T\n\n5. T, H, H\n\n6. T, H, T\n\n7. T, T, H\n\n8. T, T, T\n\nYes, there are eight possible sequences, and only one of them is H, T, H.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 1/8.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be extra sure, maybe I can consider the probability of each flip separately and then multiply them, as I did earlier.\n\nFirst flip: Heads, probability 1/2.\n\nSecond flip: Tails, probability 1/2.\n\nThird flip: Heads, probability 1/2.\n\nMultiplying them: 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous conclusion.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider here? Perhaps using conditional probability?\n\nWell, since the flips are independent, conditional probability might not change anything. But let's try it anyway.\n\nLet's say, the probability of getting heads on the first flip given that the second is tails and the third is heads.\n\nWait, no, that's not what the question is asking. The question is for the joint probability of the sequence H, T, H.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach is best.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The probability is 1/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
