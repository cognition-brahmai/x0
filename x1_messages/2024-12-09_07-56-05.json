The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the distance is 240 kilometers and the speed is 60 kilometers per hour, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{240 \\text{ km}}{60 \\text{ km/h}}\n\\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 hours to cover a distance of 240 kilometers at a constant speed of 60 kilometers per hour."
