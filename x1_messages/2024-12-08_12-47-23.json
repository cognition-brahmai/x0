        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells a product at $60 per unit, and their cost to produce each unit is $40. Now, they're offering a 15% discount on the product due to increased competition. We need to find out what their new profit margin percentage will be after applying this discount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit margin percentage means. Profit margin percentage is a measure of profit relative to the selling price. It's calculated as (Profit per unit / Selling price per unit) * 100%.\n\nOkay, so before the discount, the selling price is $60, and the cost per unit is $40. So, the profit per unit before the discount is $60 - $40 = $20.\n\nThe profit margin percentage before the discount would be ($20 / $60) * 100% = 33.33%. But we need to find out the profit margin after the discount.\n\nThe discount is 15% on the selling price. So, the discount amount is 15% of $60, which is 0.15 * $60 = $9.\n\nTherefore, the new selling price after the discount is $60 - $9 = $51.\n\nNow, the cost remains the same at $40 per unit. So, the new profit per unit is $51 - $40 = $11.\n\nFinally, the new profit margin percentage is ($11 / $51) * 100%.\n\nLet me calculate that: $11 divided by $51 is approximately 0.2157, and multiplying by 100% gives about 21.57%.\n\nSo, the new profit margin percentage after applying the 15% discount is approximately 21.57%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21.57\\%} \\]"
