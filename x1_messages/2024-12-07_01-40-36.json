        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if a square has an area of 144 square units, what's the length of its diagonal? Okay, let's see. I know that the area of a square is given by the formula \\( A = s^2 \\), where \\( s \\) is the length of one side. So, if the area is 144 square units, that means \\( s^2 = 144 \\). To find \\( s \\), I need to take the square root of both sides. So, \\( s = \\sqrt{144} = 12 \\) units.\n\nNow, I need to find the length of the diagonal. I remember that in a square, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the two sides of the square. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem here. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (which would be the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, if the sides are both 12 units, then the diagonal \\( d \\) would satisfy \\( d^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 \\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\( 12^2 = 144 \\), so \\( d^2 = 144 + 144 = 288 \\). Therefore, \\( d = \\sqrt{288} \\). Hmm, 288 can be simplified. I know that 288 is 144 times 2, and 144 is a perfect square. So, \\( \\sqrt{288} = \\sqrt{144 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{144} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 12\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal is \\( 12\\sqrt{2} \\) units. But just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this. I recall that in a square, the relationship between the side length and the diagonal is that the diagonal is equal to the side length times the square root of 2. Yeah, that matches what I just calculated.\n\nAlternatively, I could use trigonometry. Since all angles in a square are 90 degrees, and the diagonal bisects the angle, creating two 45-degree angles, each half of the square is a 45-45-90 triangle. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is equal to the side times \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), which again confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, no matter which way I look at it, the diagonal should be \\( 12\\sqrt{2} \\) units. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
