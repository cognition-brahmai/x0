It includes various sub-disciplines such as basic chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry. Basic chemistry deals with the fundamental principles like atomic structure, bonding, and chemical reactions. Organic chemistry focuses on the study of carbon-containing compounds, including hydrocarbons and their derivatives. Physical chemistry, on the other hand, combines principles of physics and chemistry to understand the physical properties of molecules. Based on this information, which sub-discipline of chemistry is most likely to study the physical properties of molecules?\nA. Basic Chemistry\nB. Organic Chemistry\nC. Hydrocarbon Chemistry\nD.
