        "content": "Let's see. There are 6 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many handshakes each person makes. If there are 6 people, then each person shakes hands with 5 other people, right? Because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nSo, if each of the 6 people shakes hands with 5 others, that would seem to be 6 times 5, which is 30 handshakes. But wait, that can't be right because each handshake involves two people. So, in reality, each handshake is being counted twice in that calculation\u2014once for each person involved.\n\nTo correct for that, I need to divide the total by 2, because each handshake is shared between two people. So, 30 divided by 2 would be 15 handshakes.\n\nLet me think of another way to approach this to confirm. Maybe I can try to list out the handshakes systematically.\n\nLet's number the people from 1 to 6.\n\nPerson 1 shakes hands with persons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. That's 5 handshakes.\n\nPerson 2 has already shaken hands with person 1, so they only shake hands with persons 3, 4, 5, and 6. That's 4 additional handshakes.\n\nPerson 3 has already shaken hands with persons 1 and 2, so they shake hands with persons 4, 5, and 6. That's 3 more handshakes.\n\nPerson 4 has already shaken hands with persons 1, 2, and 3, so they shake hands with persons 5 and 6. That's 2 more handshakes.\n\nPerson 5 has already shaken hands with persons 1, 2, 3, and 4, so they shake hands with person 6. That's 1 more handshake.\n\nPerson 6 has already shaken hands with everyone else, so no new handshakes here.\n\nNow, if I add up all those handshakes: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, there are 15 handshakes in total.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of something called combinations in mathematics, which might apply here. Combinations are ways to choose items from a set without regard to the order. In this case, a handshake is a combination of 2 people from a group of 6.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the total number of items,\n\n- k is the number of items to choose,\n\n- ! denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, for this problem, n = 6 and k = 2.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = (720) / (2 * 24) = 720 / 48 = 15.\n\nAgain, that gives me 15 handshakes.\n\nIt's reassuring that all these different methods lead to the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there could be any exceptions or special cases where this might not hold true.\n\nFor example, if some people don't shake hands with each other, then the total would be less. But in this problem, it's stated that everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. So, no exceptions there.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each handshake is a unique pair of people. With 6 people, how many unique pairs are there?\n\nAgain, that's the combination formula C(6, 2), which equals 15.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each person has to shake hands with every other person, but without double-counting.\n\nSo, the first person shakes hands with 5 others, the second with 4 remaining, and so on, down to the last person who has no one left to shake hands with.\n\nAdding those up: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15.\n\nThis is the same as the sum of the first (n-1) integers, where n is the total number of people.\n\nIn general, for n people, the total number of handshakes is the sum of the first (n-1) integers, which is (n*(n-1))/2.\n\nPlugging in n=6: (6*5)/2 = 15.\n\nOnce again, 15 handshakes.\n\nI think I've confirmed this through multiple approaches, and the answer is consistently 15 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
