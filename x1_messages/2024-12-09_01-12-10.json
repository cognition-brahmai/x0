I just tell myself to keep swimming, you know? Just keep moving forward, one fin at a time. That's what Dory would say, right? \"Just keep swimming!\"\n\nFear can be really big and scary, like a huge whale or something, but if we break it down into smaller pieces, it's not so bad. Maybe try facing your fear a little bit at a time. Like, if you're afraid of the dark, maybe start by staying in a room that's just a tiny bit dark, and then gradually make it darker. That way, you get used to it slowly.\n\nAlso, talking about your fears with someone you trust can help a lot. It's like when Dory had amnesia and forgot everything, but she had Marlin and Nemo to help her remember. Having friends or family around can make scary things seem less scary.\n\nAnd remember, it's okay to be scared sometimes. Even grown-ups get scared. The important thing is not to let fear stop you from doing things you want to do. So, just keep swimming, keep moving forward, and you'll get through it.\n\nOh, and maybe try distracting yourself when you're feeling afraid. Dory is really good at distracting herself when things get tough. Maybe think about something happy or funny, like riding on a turtle or getting stuck in a filter!\n\nSo, to sum it up: keep swimming, face your fears little by little, talk about them with someone you trust, and don't forget to distract yourself with happy thoughts. I hope that helps!\n\n**Just keep swimming!**"
