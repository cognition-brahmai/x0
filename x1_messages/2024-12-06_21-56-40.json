        "content": "So John can paint a house in 5 hours, and Mary can do it in 4 hours. If they work together, how long will it take them to paint the house?\n\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. I remember that when people work together, their rates of work add up. So, I need to find out how much of the house each person can paint per hour and then add those amounts together to find out their combined rate.\n\nFirst, let's find John's rate. If John can paint the whole house in 5 hours, then his rate is 1 house per 5 hours, which is 1/5 of the house per hour.\n\nSimilarly, Mary can paint the whole house in 4 hours, so her rate is 1 house per 4 hours, which is 1/4 of the house per hour.\n\nNow, if they work together, their combined rate would be John's rate plus Mary's rate. So, that's 1/5 plus 1/4 of the house per hour.\n\nTo add those fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. So, 1/5 is equal to 4/20, and 1/4 is equal to 5/20. Adding those together gives 4/20 + 5/20 = 9/20. So, together, they can paint 9/20 of the house per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how long it will take them to paint the entire house, I need to divide the whole house by their combined rate. So, time = 1 house / (9/20) houses per hour.\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that's 1 * (20/9), which is 20/9 hours.\n\n20/9 hours is the same as 2 hours and 2/9 of an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2/9 of an hour is (2/9)*60 = 13.333... minutes, which is approximately 13 minutes and 20 seconds.\n\nSo, together, John and Mary can paint the house in approximately 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider how much of the house they can paint together in one hour. As we've already calculated, that's 9/20 of the house per hour.\n\nSo, to paint one whole house, it would take them 1 / (9/20) hours, which again is 20/9 hours, or about 2.222 hours.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for combined work rates: if one person can do a job in A hours and another can do it in B hours, working together they can do the job in (A*B)/(A+B) hours.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, that's (5*4)/(5+4) = 20/9 hours, which again is about 2.222 hours.\n\nOkay, so all methods lead to the same answer. It's consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way. Suppose they work together for a certain number of hours, say T hours. In that time, John would have painted (1/5)*T of the house, and Mary would have painted (1/4)*T of the house. Together, they should have painted the whole house, so:\n\n(1/5)T + (1/4)T = 1\n\nTo solve for T, first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 20 again. So, (4/20)T + (5/20)T = 1, which simplifies to (9/20)T = 1.\n\nThen, T = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the correct answer is 20/9 hours, or approximately 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nIt's interesting how working together they can finish faster than either one alone. Mary is faster than John, but his help still speeds things up.\n\nThis kind of problem is a classic example of work rate problems, commonly found in algebra and often used to illustrate how rates can be combined.\n\nIt's always good to double-check with different methods to ensure accuracy. In this case, all methods confirm the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{20}{9} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
