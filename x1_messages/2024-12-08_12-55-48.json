        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have a car rental company with 100 cars. Each car is rented for an average of 15 days per month, and the rental rate is $40 per day. We need to find out how much revenue the company generates from car rentals in one year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what revenue means in this context. Revenue is the total income generated from the rental of cars. Since the company rents out cars, the revenue would be the product of the number of cars rented, the number of days they are rented, and the daily rental rate.\n\nSo, for one car, the monthly revenue would be the number of days it's rented per month multiplied by the daily rental rate. That is:\n\nMonthly revenue per car = Number of days rented per month \u00d7 Daily rental rate\n\nGiven that each car is rented for 15 days per month at $40 per day, the monthly revenue per car would be:\n\nMonthly revenue per car = 15 days \u00d7 $40/day = $600\n\nNow, since there are 100 cars, the total monthly revenue for all cars would be:\n\nTotal monthly revenue = Number of cars \u00d7 Monthly revenue per car\n\nTotal monthly revenue = 100 cars \u00d7 $600/car = $60,000\n\nTo find the annual revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue over 12 months. So:\n\nAnnual revenue = Total monthly revenue \u00d7 12 months\n\nAnnual revenue = $60,000/month \u00d7 12 months = $720,000\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- Number of cars: 100\n\n- Average days rented per month per car: 15\n\n- Daily rental rate: $40\n\nFirst, calculate the monthly revenue per car:\n\n15 days/month \u00d7 $40/day = $600/month per car\n\nThen, for 100 cars:\n\n100 cars \u00d7 $600/car/month = $60,000/month\n\nNow, for one year (12 months):\n\n$60,000/month \u00d7 12 months = $720,000/year\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the revenue, like cars not being rented for the full 15 days due to unavailability or maintenance.\n\nBut based on the information given, it states that each car is rented for an average of 15 days per month. So, I'll assume that this average takes into account any days when the cars are not available for rental.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"how much revenue,\" which typically refers to the gross revenue before any expenses are deducted. So, I don't need to account for costs like maintenance or operating expenses; just the income from rentals.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the rental rate is constant throughout the year or if there are seasonal variations. The problem states a constant rate of $40 per day, so I'll assume that's the case.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure about the number of months in a year. Typically, it's 12 months, but sometimes businesses might have different fiscal years. However, since it's not specified, I'll go with the standard 12 months.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any overlap in rentals or if cars are rented consecutively. But since it's an average of 15 days per month per car, I think it's safe to assume that the company is able to rent each car for that average period each month.\n\nWait, another thought: are the 15 days per month per car an average across all cars, or is it that each individual car is rented for exactly 15 days per month? I think it's an average, meaning some cars might be rented more days and some less, but on average, it's 15 days per month per car.\n\nRegardless, for the purpose of calculating total revenue, using the average should give a reasonable estimate.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that there are no errors in the multiplication:\n\n100 cars \u00d7 $600/month/car = $60,000/month\n\n$60,000/month \u00d7 12 months = $720,000/year\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's calculate it another way. If each car is rented for 15 days at $40 per day, then the annual rental days per car would be:\n\n15 days/month \u00d7 12 months = 180 days/year\n\nThen, the annual revenue per car would be:\n\n180 days/year \u00d7 $40/day = $7,200/year\n\nFor 100 cars:\n\n100 cars \u00d7 $7,200/car/year = $720,000/year\n\nThis matches the previous calculation, so I'm confident that $720,000 is the correct annual revenue.\n\nTherefore, the company generates $720,000 from car rentals in one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720000} \\]"
