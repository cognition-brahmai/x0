        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a train traveling from Town A to Town B, then stopping for an hour, and finally going to Town C. We need to find the total distance between Town A and Town C.\n\nFirst, the train goes from Town A to Town B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours for that part of the journey. To find the distance from A to B, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, distance from A to B = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNext, the train stops in Town B for 1 hour. But since it's not moving during this time, it doesn't cover any distance. So, the distance during the stop is 0 miles.\n\nThen, the train travels from Town B to Town C, which takes 3 hours at the same constant speed of 60 miles per hour. Again, using the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance from B to C = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance between Town A and Town C, I need to add the distances from A to B and from B to C.\n\nTotal distance = Distance from A to B + Distance from B to C\n\nTotal distance = 120 miles + 180 miles = 300 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me see: constant speed of 60 mph, 2 hours from A to B, 1-hour stop, then 3 hours from B to C.\n\nSo, time spent moving is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\n\nAt 60 mph, distance = 60 \u00d7 5 = 300 miles.\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it differently: the train travels for 2 hours to get from A to B, then 3 hours to get from B to C, totaling 5 hours of travel time.\n\nSince the speed is constant at 60 mph, the total distance is simply the product of speed and total time spent moving.\n\nThe stop in Town B doesn't affect the distance traveled; it just adds to the total travel time if we were to consider the entire journey's duration, but since the question is only about the total distance between A and C, we don't need to include the stop time in our distance calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total distance between Town A and Town C is 300 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
