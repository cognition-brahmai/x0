        "content": "I'm here to help with your question about U.S. Presidents born in Texas. Let's see... I know that there have been several U.S. Presidents, but I need to recall which ones were born in Texas.\n\nFirst, I remember that Lyndon B. Johnson was a President, and I think he was born in Texas. Let me confirm that. Lyndon Baines Johnson, often referred to as LBJ, was indeed the 36th President of the United States, serving from 1963 to 1969 after succeeding John F. Kennedy. And yes, he was born in Stonewall, Texas, on August 27, 1908.\n\nNow, thinking about another President born in Texas... George W. Bush comes to mind. He was the 43rd President, serving from 2001 to 2009. George W. Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, but he moved to Texas at a young age and has strong ties to the state. However, I need to check if he was born in Texas.\n\nUpon checking, George W. Bush was born in Connecticut, but his father, George H.W. Bush, was also a President and was born in Milton, Massachusetts. So neither of the Bushes were born in Texas, although they have lived there for many years.\n\nAnother President who spent a significant part of his life in Texas is Dwight D. Eisenhower. However, he was born in Denison, Texas, in 1890. Wait, Denison is in Texas? I need to verify that.\n\nActually, Dwight D. Eisenhower was born in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890. So that's another President born in Texas.\n\nBut wait, Eisenhower was from the Midwest, and he's associated with Abilene, Kansas. Still, his birthplace is Denison, Texas.\n\nSo, Lyndon B. Johnson and Dwight D. Eisenhower were both born in Texas and served as U.S. Presidents.\n\nLet me see if there are any others. Ronald Reagan was born in Illinois, Barack Obama in Hawaii, Bill Clinton in Arkansas, Jimmy Carter in Georgia, Gerald Ford in Nebraska, Richard Nixon in California, John F. Kennedy in Massachusetts, and so on.\n\nSo, it seems that Lyndon B. Johnson and Dwight D. Eisenhower are the two U.S. Presidents who were born in Texas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Lyndon B. Johnson and Dwight D. Eisenhower}} \\]"
