        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in the box, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability that both balls picked are red, and it's without replacement. So, the first ball picked affects the second pick.\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw. There are 4 red balls out of 10 total balls, so the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the first ball, there are only 9 balls left in the box after the first pick. If the first ball was red, there are now 3 red balls left out of 9 total balls. So, the probability of picking another red ball is 3/9, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event. So, it's the probability of the first ball being red times the probability of the second ball being red given that the first was red.\n\nThat is: (2/5) * (1/3) = 2/15.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 10 is C(10,2), which is 45.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 4 is C(4,2), which is 6.\n\nSo, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of outcomes, which is 6/45, which simplifies to 2/15.\n\nAlright, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 2/15 is the correct probability that both balls picked are red.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{15}} \\]"
