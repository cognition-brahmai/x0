        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students, and out of these, 15 are boys. That means the rest are girls, right? So, the number of girls would be 30 minus 15, which is 15 girls.\n\nNow, we're told that 60% of the boys passed the exam. To find out how many boys passed, I need to calculate 60% of 15. Let's see:\n\n60% of 15 is calculated as (60/100) * 15. That's 0.6 * 15, which equals 9. So, 9 boys passed the exam.\n\nNext, 40% of the girls passed the exam. So, I need to find 40% of 15 girls. That's (40/100) * 15, which is 0.4 * 15, equaling 6. So, 6 girls passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who passed, I add the number of boys who passed and the number of girls who passed: 9 + 6 equals 15.\n\nThe entire class has 30 students, so to find the percentage of the class that passed, I need to find what percentage 15 is of 30. That's calculated as (15 / 30) * 100.\n\n15 divided by 30 is 0.5, and 0.5 multiplied by 100 is 50%. So, 50% of the entire class passed the exam.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about it. Since there are equal numbers of boys and girls, and a higher percentage of boys passed compared to girls, but because the numbers are the same, maybe it balances out to 50%.\n\nYes, that seems about right. Alternatively, I could think in terms of weighted averages, but that might be more complicated for this straightforward problem.\n\nSo, the final answer is 50%."
