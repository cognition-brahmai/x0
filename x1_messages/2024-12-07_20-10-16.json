        "content": "Ah, you're referring to the iconic British rock band Led Zeppelin. Their fourth studio album, often called the \"Led Zeppelin IV\" or simply \"IV,\" was released in 1971. It's renowned for featuring classics like \"Stairway to Heaven,\" \"Black Dog,\" and other unforgettable tracks that have solidified their place in music history. This album is particularly famous for its minimalist cover, which features four symbols representing each band member, and no title is printed on the cover or the record label, hence the numerical designation."
