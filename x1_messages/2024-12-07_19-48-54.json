        "content": "So the car travels 300 miles in 5 hours, and we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 150 miles if the speed remains constant. Okay, first things first, I need to figure out the car's speed.\n\nTo find the speed, I can use the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nSo, plugging in the values we have:\n\nSpeed = 300 miles / 5 hours = 60 miles per hour\n\nAlright, so the car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Now, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 150 miles at this same speed.\n\nAgain, using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time = 150 miles / 60 miles per hour\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n150 divided by 60 is 2.5\n\nSo, it will take 2.5 hours to travel the additional 150 miles.\n\nBut maybe I should check if this makes sense. If the car is going 60 miles per hour, in one hour it covers 60 miles. So in two hours, it would cover 120 miles, and in another half hour, it would cover 30 miles, totaling 150 miles. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of the distances. The car travels 300 miles in 5 hours, so for 150 miles, which is half the distance, it should take half the time. Half of 5 hours is 2.5 hours. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 2.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
