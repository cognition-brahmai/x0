The process of mapping sentences to logical forms that express their meanings.\n\nTo elaborate, semantic parsing is a key area in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to understand the meaning behind natural language utterances or texts. It involves transforming natural language sentences into a formal representation that can be understood and processed by machines. This formal representation is often in the form of logical expressions, database queries, or other structured formats that capture the essential meaning of the sentence.\n\nFor example, consider the sentence \"Find all restaurants in New York that serve Italian food.\" Semantic parsing would involve understanding that this sentence is a request for information about restaurants, specifically those located in New York and that serve Italian cuisine. The parsed output might be a structured query language (SQL) command like \"SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE location = 'New York' AND cuisine = 'Italian'.\"\n\nThis process is crucial for applications such as virtual assistants, search engines, and chatbots, where understanding user intent and providing relevant responses is essential..semantic parsing helps bridge the gap between human language and machine-understandable formats, enabling more effective human-computer interaction."
