        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nA factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and they come in two colors: red and blue. On a particular day, there are 600 red widgets and 400 blue ones. The question is, if you pick two widgets at random, what's the probability that both are red?\n\nOkay, probability problems can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic formula for probability. The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, for the first widget, the probability that it's red should be the number of red widgets divided by the total number of widgets.\n\nThat is:\n\nP(First widget is red) = Number of red widgets / Total widgets = 600 / 1000 = 0.6\n\nNow, since I'm picking two widgets, I need to find the probability that both are red. Assuming that the picks are independent, meaning the color of the first widget doesn't affect the color of the second one. But wait, in reality, if I pick one widget, the number of widgets left changes, which might affect the probability of the second pick. This is known as sampling without replacement.\n\nSo, in this case, the picks are not independent; they are dependent events because the outcome of the first pick affects the second pick.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I need to multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event given that the first event has occurred.\n\nIn probability terms:\n\nP(Both widgets are red) = P(First widget is red) * P(Second widget is red | First widget is red)\n\nLet's calculate each part.\n\nFirst, P(First widget is red) is 600/1000 = 0.6, as I calculated earlier.\n\nNext, P(Second widget is red | First widget is red). This means, given that the first widget picked was red, what's the probability that the second one is also red.\n\nIf the first widget was red, then there are now 599 red widgets left and a total of 999 widgets left.\n\nSo, P(Second widget is red | First widget is red) = 599 / 999\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n599 divided by 999 is approximately 0.5996.\n\nSo, P(Both widgets are red) = 0.6 * 0.5996 \u2248 0.35976\n\nTo express this as a fraction, let's think about it differently.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 widgets out of 1000 is combination of 1000 taken 2 at a time, which is:\n\nC(1000, 2) = 1000! / (2! * (1000 - 2)!) = (1000 * 999) / 2 = 499500\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red widgets out of 600 is:\n\nC(600, 2) = 600! / (2! * (600 - 2)!) = (600 * 599) / 2 = 179700\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\nP(Both red) = C(600, 2) / C(1000, 2) = 179700 / 499500\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100:\n\n1797 / 4995\n\nNow, divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n599 / 1665\n\nI think this is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave it as a decimal, which is approximately 0.35976, or about 35.98%.\n\nSo, the probability that both widgets are red is approximately 0.35976 or 35.98%.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for dependent events:\n\nP(Both red) = (600/1000) * (599/999)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n600/1000 = 0.6\n\n599/999 \u2248 0.5996\n\nMultiplying: 0.6 * 0.5996 = 0.35976\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the picks were independent, meaning the first pick doesn't affect the second, then we would just square the probability of picking a red widget:\n\nP(Both red) = (0.6)^2 = 0.36\n\nBut since the picks are dependent, the actual probability is slightly less than that, at 0.35976.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that both widgets are red is approximately 0.35976 or 35.98%.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.35976} \\]"
