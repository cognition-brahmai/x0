        "content": "Certainly! To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers in JavaScript, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```javascript\nfunction gcd(a, b) {\n    // Base case: if b is 0, then gcd is a\n    if (b === 0) {\n        return a;\n    }\n    // Recursive case: gcd(a, b) is same as gcd(b, a % b)\n    return gcd(b, a % b);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Base Case:** If `b` is 0, then the GCD is `a`. This is because any number divided by 0 has the GCD equal to the number itself.\n\n2. **Recursive Case:** Otherwise, compute the GCD of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). This step repeatedly applies the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(gcd(48, 18)); // Output: 6\nconsole.log(gcd(24, 36)); // Output: 12\nconsole.log(gcd(5, 0));   // Output: 5\n```\n\nThis function works efficiently for positive integers. If you need to handle negative numbers or non-integer values, you might want to add additional checks or adjustments.\n\n### Handling Negative Numbers:\n\nIf you want your function to handle negative numbers as well, you can take the absolute values of the inputs:\n\n```javascript\nfunction gcd(a, b) {\n    a = Math.abs(a);\n    b = Math.abs(b);\n    if (b === 0) {\n        return a;\n    }\n    return gcd(b, a % b);\n}\n```\n\n### Iterative Approach:\n\nAlternatively, you can implement the GCD function iteratively to avoid recursion:\n\n```javascript\nfunction gcd(a, b) {\n    a = Math.abs(a);\n    b = Math.abs(b);\n    while (b !== 0) {\n        let temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n```\n\nThis iterative approach achieves the same result without using recursion, which can be more efficient in some environments.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
