        "content": "So there are 5 cats in a room, and each cat catches 3 mice. If each mouse weighs 20 grams, we need to find out how much all the mice weigh together.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many mice there are in total. Since there are 5 cats and each catches 3 mice, we can multiply the number of cats by the number of mice each cat catches:\n\n5 cats \u00d7 3 mice/cat = 15 mice\n\nNow, each mouse weighs 20 grams. To find the total weight of all the mice, we multiply the number of mice by the weight of each mouse:\n\n15 mice \u00d7 20 grams/mouse = 300 grams\n\nSo, all the mice together weigh 300 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
