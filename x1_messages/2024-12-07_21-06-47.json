The bald eagle was chosen because of its long life, strength, and majestic appearance, and it represents freedom and independence. The Great Seal itself has two sides: the obverse side features the bald eagle grasping arrows and an olive branch, symbolizing readiness for war and peace, while the reverse side shows an unfinished pyramid with the eye of providence, signifying future growth and divine guidance."
