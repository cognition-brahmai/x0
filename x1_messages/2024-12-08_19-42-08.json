        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an airline that wants to figure out the optimal number of flights between two cities to maximize profit. They've given us some numbers to work with:\n\n- Each flight brings in an average revenue of $25,000.\n\n- The variable cost per flight is $15,000. This includes things like fuel, crew, and maintenance.\n\n- There are also fixed costs of $1 million per month for airport fees and other expenses.\n\nFirst, we need to find the break-even point. That's the number of flights where the total revenue equals the total costs. After that, we'll calculate the monthly profit if they operate 200 flights per month.\n\nLet's start with the break-even point.\n\n**Calculating the Break-Even Point:**\n\nThe break-even point is where total revenue equals total costs.\n\nTotal Revenue (TR) = Number of flights (n) \u00d7 Revenue per flight\n\nTotal Costs (TC) = Fixed Costs (FC) + (Number of flights (n) \u00d7 Variable Cost per flight (VC))\n\nAt break-even: TR = TC\n\nSo,\n\nn \u00d7 $25,000 = $1,000,000 + (n \u00d7 $15,000)\n\nWe need to solve for n.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation:\n\nn \u00d7 $25,000 - n \u00d7 $15,000 = $1,000,000\n\nn \u00d7 ($25,000 - $15,000) = $1,000,000\n\nn \u00d7 $10,000 = $1,000,000\n\nNow, divide both sides by $10,000:\n\nn = $1,000,000 / $10,000\n\nn = 100 flights\n\nSo, the break-even point is 100 flights per month.\n\n**Calculating Monthly Profit for 200 Flights:**\n\nNow, if they operate 200 flights per month, we need to find out the monthly profit.\n\nFirst, calculate the total revenue for 200 flights:\n\nTR = 200 \u00d7 $25,000 = $5,000,000\n\nNext, calculate the total variable costs for 200 flights:\n\nTVC = 200 \u00d7 $15,000 = $3,000,000\n\nThen, add the fixed costs:\n\nTC = FC + TVC = $1,000,000 + $3,000,000 = $4,000,000\n\nNow, profit (\u03c0) is total revenue minus total costs:\n\n\u03c0 = TR - TC = $5,000,000 - $4,000,000 = $1,000,000\n\nSo, if they operate 200 flights per month, they would make a monthly profit of $1 million.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Break-even point: 100 flights per month\n\n- Monthly profit for 200 flights: $1,000,000\n\nI think that covers the questions asked. If there's anything else or if I've missed something, please let me know."
