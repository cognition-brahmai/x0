        "content": "So there are 10 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about one person. If there are 10 people, and one person shakes hands with every other person, that would be 9 handshakes for that one person because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nBut wait, if every person does that, then it would seem like there are 10 people each shaking hands with 9 others, which would be 10 times 9, equal to 90 handshakes.\n\nHowever, I think that counts each handshake twice because when person A shakes hands with person B, it's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, in reality, each handshake is being counted twice in that calculation.\n\nTo correct for that, I should divide the total by 2. So, 90 divided by 2 equals 45.\n\nTherefore, there are 45 unique handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this as a combination problem. Specifically, I need to choose 2 people out of 10 to shake hands, and the order doesn't matter. That's the same as calculating \"10 choose 2.\"\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 10 and k = 2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/ (2 * 1 * 8! * 6!)) but actually, 8! cancels out.\n\nWait, better to write it as C(10, 2) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nSo again, that gives me 45 handshakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the first person shakes hands with 9 others, the second person shakes hands with 8 remaining people (since they've already shaken hands with the first), the third with 7, and so on, down to the last person who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1.\n\nAdding those up: 9 + 8 = 17, 17 + 7 = 24, 24 + 6 = 30, 30 + 5 = 35, 35 + 4 = 39, 39 + 3 = 42, 42 + 2 = 44, 44 + 1 = 45.\n\nAgain, 45 handshakes.\n\nI think this makes sense. All these different approaches lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that 45 is the correct number of handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
