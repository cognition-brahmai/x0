        "content": "Ticks do not jump or fall from trees to attach to their hosts. They are wingless and cannot fly or jump. Instead, they use a behavior called \"questing\" to find hosts. Questing ticks position themselves on grass, bushes, or other vegetation, typically with their front legs extended. When a potential host, such as an animal or human, brushes past the vegetation, the ticks can latch onto the host using their hooked claws on their legs. This is why it's important to be cautious in areas with high grass or dense vegetation where ticks may be present."
