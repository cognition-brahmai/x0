The hospital receives funding from various sources, including government grants ($4 million), private donations ($3 million), and internal reserves ($2 million). To cover the remaining costs, the hospital needs to secure a loan. Calculate the amount of the loan required and provide a step-by-step explanation."

        "content": "So the hospital is looking to upgrade its medical equipment, and the total cost for this upgrade is $12 million. They've got funding coming from different places: government grants, private donations, and their own internal reserves. Let's see how much they've already got covered and how much they still need to borrow.\n\nFirst, there are government grants totaling $4 million. That's a big chunk of the total cost. Then, there are private donations amounting to $3 million. That's additional funding they've received from generous donors. Lastly, they're using $2 million from their internal reserves. That's money they've saved up themselves.\n\nSo, to find out how much they've already got, I need to add up these amounts: the grants, the donations, and the internal reserves.\n\nLet's do that:\n\nGovernment grants: $4,000,000\n\nPrivate donations: $3,000,000\n\nInternal reserves: $2,000,000\n\nTotal funded: $4,000,000 + $3,000,000 + $2,000,000 = $9,000,000\n\nSo, they have $9 million covered, but the total cost is $12 million. To find out how much more they need, I'll subtract the funded amount from the total cost.\n\n$12,000,000 (total cost) - $9,000,000 (funded) = $3,000,000\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to secure a loan of $3 million to cover the remaining costs.\n\nJust to double-check, let's make sure the additions and subtractions are correct.\n\nGovernment grants: $4 million\n\nPrivate donations: $3 million\n\nInternal reserves: $2 million\n\nTotal: $4M + $3M = $7M, plus $2M = $9M\n\nTotal cost: $12M\n\nRemaining: $12M - $9M = $3M\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the loan required is $3 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3000000} \\]"
