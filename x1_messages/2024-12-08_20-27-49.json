        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 widgets every day, and each widget needs 3 screws. So, first, I need to find out how many screws are needed per day.\n\nSo, screws per day would be 200 widgets times 3 screws per widget. That's 200 * 3 = 600 screws per day.\n\nNow, the factory works 6 days a week. But the question is about a month with 30 days. I need to figure out how many days in that 30-day month the factory is actually working.\n\nSince it works 6 days a week, I can calculate the number of weeks in 30 days. There are about 4 weeks in a month, but 4 weeks would be 28 days (since 4 * 7 = 28). But the month has 30 days, so that's 2 days extra.\n\nSo, in 4 weeks, the factory works 6 days each week, which is 6 * 4 = 24 days. Plus the 2 extra days. But does the factory work on those extra 2 days? I think I need to assume that the factory works only on the days it normally operates, which is 6 days a week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of working days based on the 30-day month.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to find out how many days the factory works in a 30-day month.\n\nIf it works 6 days a week, and assuming a month has about 4 weeks, that would be 6 * 4 = 24 working days.\n\nBut actually, a 30-day month has roughly 4 weeks and 2 extra days. If the factory works 6 days a week, it might or might not work on those extra 2 days.\n\nTo simplify, maybe I can assume that in a 30-day month, the factory works 6 days each week for 4 weeks, totaling 24 days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of working days based on the 30-day month directly.\n\nLet me think differently. If the factory works 6 days a week, and there are 30 days in the month, I need to find out how many of those 30 days it is working.\n\nAssuming that the factory's work schedule is consistent, working 6 days a week, I can calculate the number of working days in 30 days.\n\nFirst, find out how many weeks are in 30 days: 30 / 7 \u2248 4.2857 weeks.\n\nThen, multiply the number of weeks by the number of working days per week: 4.2857 * 6 \u2248 25.714, which I can round to 26 working days in the month.\n\nWait, but 4 weeks would be 28 days, and then there are 2 extra days. If the factory works 6 days a week, it might work on some of those extra days.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should ask: does the factory work for 6 days every week, or does it work for 6 days in a 7-day cycle?\n\nAssuming it's the former, working 6 days each week, then in a 4-week month, that's 24 working days. With 2 extra days, if those days are part of the workdays, then the factory would work on them as well.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated for what should be a straightforward problem.\n\nMaybe the question implies that the factory works 6 days a week, and the week is a standard 7-day week. So, in a 30-day month, there are approximately 4 weeks and 2 extra days.\n\nIf the factory works 6 days each week, then in 4 weeks, it works 24 days. The remaining 2 days would depend on the specific month and the starting day.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that the factory works 6 days each week, and the month has 30 days, which is roughly 4 weeks and 2 extra days. Assuming the factory works 6 days each week, the total working days in the month would be 6 * 4 = 24 days, plus possibly some of the extra 2 days.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, maybe I should calculate the number of working days based on the total days in the month and the weekly work schedule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory works 6 days a week for the entire month, regardless of the number of weeks in the month.\n\nGiven that, in a 30-day month, the factory works 6 days each week, leading to 24 working days (4 weeks * 6 days/week).\n\nHowever, 30 days might include a few extra days beyond the complete weeks. If the factory's work schedule is strictly 6 days a week, then those extra days might or might not be working days.\n\nTo make this less complicated, perhaps I should consider that the factory works 6 days a week, and the month has 30 days, which is about 4 weeks and 2 extra days. Assuming the factory follows a standard work schedule, it likely works for 24 days in the month.\n\nTherefore, total screws needed would be screws per day multiplied by the number of working days.\n\nSo, 600 screws per day * 24 days = 14,400 screws.\n\nWait, but the question might expect a different approach. Maybe it wants to consider the entire 30 days, regardless of the work schedule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory works 6 days a week, but in a 30-day month, it works a certain number of weeks.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nFirst, find out how many weeks are in 30 days. Since a week has 7 days, 30 / 7 \u2248 4.2857 weeks.\n\nThen, if the factory works 6 days a week, the total working days in the month would be 6 * 4.2857 \u2248 25.714, which I can round to 26 days.\n\nTherefore, total screws needed would be 600 screws per day * 26 days = 15,600 screws.\n\nBut earlier I calculated 24 days, now 26 days. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nMaybe I should consider that in a 30-day month, there are exactly 4 weeks and 2 extra days. So, 4 weeks * 6 working days = 24 days, plus if the extra 2 days are working days, then total working days would be 26.\n\nAssuming that the extra 2 days are working days, total working days would be 26.\n\nTherefore, total screws needed would be 600 * 26 = 15,600 screws.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory works 6 days a week and the month has 30 days, but the extra 2 days are not working days, then total working days would be 24, leading to 14,400 screws.\n\nBut I think it's safe to assume that in a 30-day month, the factory works 26 days, given that it works 6 days a week.\n\nTherefore, the total number of screws needed would be 600 screws per day * 26 days = 15,600 screws.\n\nSo, the factory needs 15,600 screws in a month with 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15600} \\]"
