        "content": "So, the company produces 5,000 units every day and sells each unit for $25. We need to find out how much revenue they generate in a year, assuming there are no holidays or weekends. That means the company operates every single day of the year.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the daily revenue. That should be the number of units produced each day multiplied by the price per unit. So, 5,000 units times $25 per unit.\n\n5,000 * 25 = 125,000\n\nSo, the company makes $125,000 every day.\n\nNow, to find the annual revenue, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a year. Typically, there are 365 days in a year. But since the question says there are no holidays or weekends, I guess they mean the company operates every day, including weekends and holidays. So, it's still 365 days.\n\nWait a minute, but actually, in a non-leap year, there are 365 days, but in a leap year, there are 366. Should we consider that?\n\nHmm, the question doesn't specify whether it's a leap year or not. To keep it simple, maybe we can assume it's a non-leap year with 365 days.\n\nSo, annual revenue would be:\n\n125,000 * 365\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 125,000 times 300 is 37,500,000.\n\nThen, 125,000 times 60 is 7,500,000.\n\nAnd finally, 125,000 times 5 is 625,000.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n37,500,000 + 7,500,000 = 45,000,000\n\nPlus 625,000 is 45,625,000.\n\nSo, the annual revenue would be $45,625,000.\n\nBut wait, is there a easier way to calculate this?\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply 25 * 5,000 * 365.\n\nOr, 5,000 * 25 = 125,000, and then times 365, which is what I did.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it differently, 5,000 units/day * 365 days/year = 1,825,000 units/year.\n\nThen, 1,825,000 units * $25/unit = $45,625,000.\n\nSame answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nLet's see, another way could be to calculate monthly revenue and then multiply by 12.\n\nBut since the question specifies a year and doesn't mention months, maybe it's unnecessary.\n\nBut for verification, let's try it.\n\nAssuming each month has approximately 30 days.\n\nSo, 5,000 units/day * 30 days/month = 150,000 units/month.\n\nThen, 150,000 units * $25/unit = $3,750,000 per month.\n\nNow, over 12 months, that would be 3,750,000 * 12 = $45,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's $45,000,000, but earlier I got $45,625,000.\n\nWhy the difference?\n\nAh, because assuming each month has 30 days leads to 30 * 12 = 360 days, which is 5 days short of 365.\n\nSo, 360 days would be 5,000 * 25 * 360 = 125,000 * 360 = $45,000,000.\n\nThen, the remaining 5 days would be 125,000 * 5 = $625,000.\n\nSo, total $45,000,000 + $625,000 = $45,625,000.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, so it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a leap year with 366 days, the revenue would be slightly higher.\n\nBut since the question specifies no holidays or weekends, but doesn't specify about leap years, maybe it's safe to assume it's a non-leap year with 365 days.\n\nTherefore, the annual revenue is $45,625,000.\n\nBut to be more precise, perhaps I should consider that years can be leap years.\n\nSo, on average, every 4 years, there is one leap year with 366 days.\n\nBut the question seems to be about a single year, so maybe it's better to stick with 365 days unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company operates every single day, including February 29th in leap years, but since it's not specified, perhaps it's safer to assume 365 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question implies that there are no holidays or weekends, meaning the company operates 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, which would be 364 days.\n\nBut that would be less than 365 days.\n\nWait, 52 weeks * 7 days/week = 364 days.\n\nBut actually, a year has 365 or 366 days, which is more than 364.\n\nSo, if there are no holidays or weekends, that means the company operates every day, including weekends.\n\nBut in reality, there are 52 weeks in a year, totaling 364 days, and one extra day in a non-leap year, or two in a leap year.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to consider 365 days in a year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants us to consider that the company operates every single day, including weekends, with no downtime.\n\nIn that case, it's 365 days.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, the annual revenue would be $45,625,000.\n\nBut perhaps I should present the calculation step by step to ensure clarity.\n\nFirst, calculate daily revenue:\n\nUnits produced per day: 5,000\n\nSelling price per unit: $25\n\nDaily revenue: 5,000 * 25 = $125,000\n\nNext, calculate annual revenue:\n\nDays in a year: 365\n\nAnnual revenue: 125,000 * 365 = $45,625,000\n\nTherefore, the company generates $45,625,000 in revenue in a year.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the company operates every single day without any breaks, including weekends and holidays, and assuming there are no leap years, then the calculation stands.\n\nBut to be more accurate, perhaps we should consider that a year might have 366 days in a leap year.\n\nIn that case, the annual revenue would be:\n\n125,000 * 366 = $45,750,000\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify, maybe it's better to stick with 365 days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer should account for both possibilities.\n\nSo, in a non-leap year: $45,625,000\n\nIn a leap year: $45,750,000\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it.\n\nGiven that the question states \"there are no holidays or weekends,\" but doesn't specify about leap years, maybe it's safe to assume a standard 365-day year.\n\nTherefore, the annual revenue is $45,625,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects a general formula without specifying the number of days in a year.\n\nBut given that it's a numerical problem, it's likely expecting a specific numerical answer.\n\nSo, I think $45,625,000 is the appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45625000} \\]"
