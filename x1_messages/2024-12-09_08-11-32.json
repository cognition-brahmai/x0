        "content": "So I've got this problem here: an apple tree produces 200 apples a year, and a farmer has 12 of these trees. I need to figure out how many apples he produces in a decade. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a decade is. I know that a decade is 10 years. So, if I'm calculating production over a decade, I'm looking at 10 years of apple production.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many apples one tree produces in a year. According to the problem, one tree produces 200 apples per year. Since the farmer has 12 trees, I should calculate the total annual production by multiplying the number of trees by the production per tree.\n\nSo, that's 12 trees times 200 apples per tree, which equals 2,400 apples per year.\n\nNow, since I need to find out the total production over 10 years, I'll multiply the annual production by the number of years in a decade.\n\nThat means 2,400 apples per year times 10 years.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 2,400 times 10 equals 24,000 apples.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with one tree producing 200 apples a year, and 12 trees would produce 12 times 200, which is 2,400 apples per year. Over 10 years, that would indeed be 2,400 times 10, which is 24,000 apples.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Is there any other factor I should consider? For example, are there any variables like tree production decreasing over time or increased production due to fertilizers? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume constant production.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. We're dealing with apples per year, number of trees, and number of years, all of which are straightforward numerical values without any conversions needed.\n\nSo, my final answer should be that the farmer produces 24,000 apples in a decade.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me write it out with the units included at each step.\n\nFirst, annual production per tree: 200 apples/tree/year.\n\nNumber of trees: 12 trees.\n\nTotal annual production: 200 apples/tree/year * 12 trees = 2,400 apples/year.\n\nNumber of years in a decade: 10 years.\n\nTotal production in a decade: 2,400 apples/year * 10 years = 24,000 apples.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I've accounted for all the given information and performed the necessary multiplications to arrive at the total production over the specified period.\n\nI think that's the answer: 24,000 apples in a decade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]"
