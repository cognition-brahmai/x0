        "content": "Let's see here. John buys 4 pounds of apples, and they cost $1.50 per pound. So first, I need to find out how much he spends in total on apples.\n\nI think I should multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds he buys. So that would be $1.50 times 4 pounds.\n\nLet me do that: 1.50 \u00d7 4 = $6.00. So, he spends $6.00 on apples.\n\nNow, he gives the cashier a $10 bill. To find out how much change he should get back, I need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he gave to the cashier.\n\nSo, $10.00 minus $6.00 equals $4.00.\n\nTherefore, John should receive $4.00 in change.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the cost per pound is $1.50, and he buys 4 pounds. So, 1.50 \u00d7 4:\n\n1 \u00d7 4 = 4.00\n\n0.50 \u00d7 4 = 2.00\n\nAdding those together, 4.00 + 2.00 = $6.00. That seems correct.\n\nThen, $10.00 minus $6.00 is indeed $4.00.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
