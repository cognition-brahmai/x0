        "content": "So there are 50 students in total in the class. Out of these, 20 play basketball, 30 play soccer, and 10 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I remember that when you have two overlapping sets, you can add the number of people in each set and then subtract the number of people who are in both to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, let's see. If 20 students play basketball and 30 play soccer, that's a total of 50 students. But wait, 10 students play both, so they've been counted in both the basketball and soccer groups. Therefore, to find the total number of students who play at least one sport, I should add the number of basketball players and soccer players and then subtract those who play both.\n\nSo, total playing at least one sport = (basketball players) + (soccer players) - (both).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 20 + 30 - 10 = 40 students.\n\nSo, 40 students play at least one of the two sports. Since there are 50 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport.\n\nTherefore, students not playing either sport = total students - students playing at least one sport = 50 - 40 = 10 students.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. If 10 students play both sports, and they are included in both the basketball and soccer counts, then yes, adding 20 and 30 would count these 10 students twice, so subtracting 10 makes sense to correct for that double-counting.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The principle states that to find the union of two sets, you add the sizes of the individual sets and subtract the size of their intersection.\n\nSo, |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nHere, A is the set of basketball players, and B is the set of soccer players.\n\nSo, |A \u222a B| = 20 + 30 - 10 = 40.\n\nAnd the number of students not in A or B is the total number of students minus those in the union of A and B, which is 50 - 40 = 10.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the number of students who play only basketball, only soccer, and both, and then see how these add up.\n\nStudents who play only basketball: 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nStudents who play only soccer: 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nStudents who play both: 10.\n\nSo, total students playing at least one sport: 10 (only basketball) + 20 (only soccer) + 10 (both) = 40.\n\nAgain, subtracting this from the total number of students gives 50 - 40 = 10 students who don't play either sport.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, so I'm fairly confident that the answer is 10 students.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nSuppose I make a Venn diagram with two circles, one for basketball and one for soccer. The overlap between the two circles represents students who play both sports, which is 10 students.\n\nThe part of the basketball circle outside the overlap is students who play only basketball, which is 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the soccer circle outside the overlap is students who play only soccer, which is 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nSo, adding up the parts: only basketball (10) + only soccer (20) + both (10) = 40 students play at least one sport.\n\nTotal students are 50, so 50 - 40 = 10 students do not play either sport.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the students who play neither sport as the complement of the union of the two sets.\n\nSo, number of students not playing either sport = total students - (students playing basketball or soccer).\n\nWhich again is 50 - 40 = 10.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion, so I think it's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any students who play other sports not mentioned here. The question only talks about basketball and soccer, so I assume that the students who play sports only play these two, unless specified otherwise.\n\nSince the question doesn't mention any other sports, I can safely assume that any student who plays a sport plays either basketball, soccer, or both.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who do not play either sport is indeed 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
