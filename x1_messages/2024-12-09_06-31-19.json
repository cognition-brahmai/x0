        "content": "Let's see. There are 800 students in the school, and 60% of them participate in sports activities. So first, I need to find out how many students participate in sports.\n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 60% of 800. Percentage means per hundred, so 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.6. Multiplying 800 by 0.6 should give me the number of students who participate in sports.\n\n800 * 0.6 = 480 students participate in sports.\n\nNow, among these 480 students, 40% play basketball. Again, 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4. So, to find out how many play basketball, I'll multiply 480 by 0.4.\n\n480 * 0.4 = 192 students play basketball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about it. If 60% participate in sports and 40% of those play basketball, then the percentage of the total student body that plays basketball is 60% times 40%.\n\nSo, 60% of 40% is (60/100) * (40/100) = 24/100 or 24%. So, 24% of the total 800 students play basketball.\n\nLet me calculate that: 24% of 800 is 0.24 * 800 = 192 students.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, the number of students who play basketball is 192.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor at play here. The problem says that 60% of students participate in sports, and among those, 40% play basketball. It doesn't mention any overlapping activities or any students who might play basketball without participating in sports. So, I think 192 is the correct answer.\n\nStill, perhaps I should consider if all basketball players are included in the sports participants. If some students play basketball outside of school sports, but the question specifies sports activities, so probably those are the only ones counted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some students participate in multiple sports, but the question is only about how many play basketball, so that shouldn't affect the calculation.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 192 students play basketball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192} \\]"
