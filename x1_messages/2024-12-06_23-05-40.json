        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about two trains leaving different stations at the same time and traveling towards each other. Train A is going at 60 miles per hour, and Train B is going at 80 miles per hour. They pass each other after 2 hours. I need to find out how far apart the stations were.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what's happening here. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds are adding up because they're coming from opposite directions. So, the combined speed at which they're approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nSpeed of Train A = 60 mph\n\nSpeed of Train B = 80 mph\n\nCombined speed = 60 + 80 = 140 mph\n\nOkay, so together, they're closing the distance between them at 140 miles per hour.\n\nNow, they pass each other after 2 hours. So, the total distance they cover in those 2 hours is the distance between the two stations.\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, Distance = 140 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 280 miles\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how far each train travels in 2 hours and then add those distances together.\n\nTrain A travels at 60 mph for 2 hours: 60 \u00d7 2 = 120 miles\n\nTrain B travels at 80 mph for 2 hours: 80 \u00d7 2 = 160 miles\n\nTotal distance between stations = 120 + 160 = 280 miles\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is again 140 mph. Then, time is 2 hours, so distance is 140 \u00d7 2 = 280 miles.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. The stations were 280 miles apart.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this problem. Maybe if one train had started later or something, but in this case, both start at the same time and travel towards each other.\n\nAnother way is to think about how much distance they cover each hour and see after 2 hours where they are.\n\nIn the first hour:\n\nTrain A covers 60 miles\n\nTrain B covers 80 miles\n\nSo together, they cover 60 + 80 = 140 miles in the first hour.\n\nIn the second hour, they each cover the same distances again:\n\nTrain A another 60 miles, Train B another 80 miles.\n\nSo in the second hour, they cover another 140 miles.\n\nTotal distance covered in 2 hours: 140 \u00d7 2 = 280 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]"
