        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car rental company with 100 cars, and they're renting each car out at an average of $50 per day. That means their current daily revenue is 100 cars times $50 per car, which is $5,000 per day.\n\nNow, the company is thinking about increasing its daily rental rate by 10%. So, a 10% increase on $50 would be $50 multiplied by 0.10, which is $5. Therefore, the new rental rate would be $50 plus $5, making it $55 per day per car.\n\nBut, there's a catch. This increase in rental rate is expected to lead to a 5% decrease in the number of cars rented. So, if they have 100 cars and there's a 5% decrease in the number of cars rented, that means 5% of 100 cars won't be rented. 5% of 100 is 5 cars. Therefore, the new number of cars rented would be 100 minus 5, which is 95 cars.\n\nNow, to find the new daily revenue, we need to multiply the new number of cars rented by the new rental rate. So, that's 95 cars times $55 per car.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 95 times $55.\n\nFirst, 100 times 55 is 5,500. But since we have 95 cars, which is 5 less than 100, we can subtract 5 times $55 from 5,500.\n\n5 times $55 is $275.\n\nSo, 5,500 minus 275 is $5,225.\n\nTherefore, the new daily revenue would be $5,225.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can calculate it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the new rental rate and the new number of cars rented directly.\n\nOriginal rental rate: $50 per day.\n\nIncrease by 10%: $50 * 0.10 = $5.\n\nNew rental rate: $50 + $5 = $55.\n\nOriginal number of cars rented: 100.\n\nDecrease by 5%: 100 * 0.05 = 5.\n\nNew number of cars rented: 100 - 5 = 95.\n\nNew daily revenue: 95 cars * $55 per car = $5,225.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages.\n\nThe price increases by 10%, and the quantity demanded decreases by 5%. So, the overall effect on revenue would be (1 + 0.10) * (1 - 0.05) - 1.\n\nLet's compute that: (1.10) * (0.95) - 1 = 1.045 - 1 = 0.045, or a 4.5% increase in revenue.\n\nOriginal revenue: $5,000.\n\n4.5% of $5,000 is $5,000 * 0.045 = $225.\n\nSo, new revenue would be $5,000 + $225 = $5,225.\n\nAgain, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we should account for. For example, are there any costs involved, or is there any other variable that could affect revenue? The problem doesn't mention any other costs or variables, so I think we can assume that the only changes are in the rental rate and the number of cars rented.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the decrease in the number of cars rented is directly due to the increase in rental rate, and there are no other external factors affecting demand.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the new daily revenue would be $5,225.\n\nLet me write that down clearly.\n\nNew daily revenue: $5,225.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5225} \\]"
