        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in a row, numbered from 1 to 10, I assume. The postman delivers mail differently on Monday and Tuesday based on the weather.\n\nOn Monday, because it's raining, he skips every other house, delivering only to the odd-numbered houses. So, that would be houses 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\nOn Tuesday, it's still raining, so he delivers only to the even-numbered houses, which are houses 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.\n\nThe question is, how many houses did not receive mail on both days?\n\nHmm, let's think about this. On Monday, odd-numbered houses got mail, and on Tuesday, even-numbered houses got mail. So, every house received mail on one of the days, right?\n\nHouse 1 got mail on Monday, house 2 on Tuesday, house 3 on Monday, and so on, up to house 10 on Tuesday.\n\nSo, is there any house that didn't get mail on both days? Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. It says \"did not receive mail on both days.\" Does that mean houses that didn't get mail on either Monday or Tuesday, or houses that didn't get mail on both days simultaneously?\n\nLet me clarify the language here. If it says \"did not receive mail on both days,\" it probably means houses that didn't get mail on both days at the same time, meaning houses that got mail on at least one day.\n\nBut, to be precise, \"did not receive mail on both days\" could be interpreted as houses that didn't get mail on Monday and Tuesday together, which would be all houses since each got mail on one day.\n\nAlternatively, it could be interpreted as houses that didn't get mail on both days, meaning they got mail on only one day or neither day.\n\nWait, but given the delivery pattern, every house got mail on one of the two days. So, no house got mail on both days.\n\nTherefore, all 10 houses did not receive mail on both days.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nPerhaps \"did not receive mail on both days\" means houses that didn't get mail on Monday and didn't get mail on Tuesday, meaning they never got mail.\n\nBut according to the delivery pattern, all houses got mail on one of the two days, so no house didn't get mail on both days.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the question in logical terms.\n\nLet M be the set of houses that got mail on Monday.\n\nLet T be the set of houses that got mail on Tuesday.\n\nWe have:\n\nM = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nT = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nThe question is asking for the number of houses that did not receive mail on both days.\n\nIf we interpret this as houses that did not receive mail on Monday and did not receive mail on Tuesday, that would be houses not in M and not in T.\n\nIn set notation, it's the complement of (M union T).\n\nBut since M and T together include all houses (M union T = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}), the complement is empty.\n\nTherefore, no house did not receive mail on both days.\n\nBut that seems to contradict the initial understanding.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for houses that did not receive mail on both days simultaneously, meaning houses that didn't get mail on Monday and Tuesday at the same time.\n\nBut since no house got mail on both days, all houses fit that criteria.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider the logical negation.\n\nThe negation of \"received mail on both days\" is \"did not receive mail on at least one day.\"\n\nBut in this scenario, every house received mail on one day, so every house did not receive mail on the other day.\n\nTherefore, all houses did not receive mail on at least one day.\n\nSo, the number of houses that did not receive mail on both days is all 10 houses.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is poorly phrased, and it's intended to ask \"how many houses did not receive mail on either day?\"\n\nIn that case, since all houses received mail on one of the two days, the answer would be zero.\n\nBut the phrasing is \"did not receive mail on both days,\" which is different.\n\nI think the confusion stems from the phrasing of the question.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nIf the question is asking for houses that did not receive mail on both days, it could mean houses that didn't get mail on Monday and didn't get mail on Tuesday.\n\nIn other words, houses that were skipped on both days.\n\nGiven the delivery pattern, on Monday, odd-numbered houses got mail, and on Tuesday, even-numbered houses got mail.\n\nTherefore, no house was skipped on both days, because every house got mail on one of the two days.\n\nHence, the number of houses that did not receive mail on both days is zero.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is interpreted as houses that did not receive mail on both days simultaneously, meaning houses that didn't get mail on Monday and Tuesday at the same time, then that would be all houses, since none received mail on both days.\n\nBut that seems to not make much sense in the context of the question.\n\nGiven the confusion in interpretation, I'll stick with the first approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is zero houses did not receive mail on both days, because all houses received mail on one of the two days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
