        "content": "Sure! Below is a simple Python script that uses the OpenCV library to detect faces in an image and draw bounding boxes around them. This script uses Haar cascades, which is a machine learning-based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images.\n\nFirst, make sure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install opencv-python\n```\n\nHere's the script:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\ndef detect_faces(image_path):\n    # Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade face detection model\n    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')\n    \n    # Read the image\n    img = cv2.imread(image_path)\n    \n    if img is None:\n        print(\"Error: Could not read the image.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Convert the image to grayscale\n    gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n    \n    # Detect faces in the image\n    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_img, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))\n    \n    # Draw bounding boxes around the detected faces\n    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:\n        cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)\n    \n    # Display the image with detected faces\n    cv2.imshow('Detected Faces', img)\n    cv2.waitKey(0)\n    cv2.destroyAllWindows()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'  # Replace with your image path\n    detect_faces(image_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Load the Haar Cascade Model:** \n   - The `CascadeClassifier` is loaded with a pre-trained model for detecting frontal faces.\n\n2. **Read the Image:**\n   - The image is read using `cv2.imread()`. Make sure to provide the correct path to your image.\n\n3. **Convert to Grayscale:**\n   - The image is converted to grayscale because the Haar Cascade classifier works on grayscale images.\n\n4. **Detect Faces:**\n   - The `detectMultiScale` function is used to detect faces. It returns a list of rectangles where faces are found.\n   - Parameters:\n     - `scaleFactor`: Specifies how much the image size is reduced at each image scale.\n     - `minNeighbors`: Specifies how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it.\n     - `minSize`: Sets the minimum possible object size.\n\n5. **Draw Bounding Boxes:**\n   - For each detected face, a blue rectangle is drawn around it.\n\n6. **Display the Image:**\n   - The image with bounding boxes is displayed using `cv2.imshow()`.\n   - `cv2.waitKey(0)` waits for a key press to close the window.\n   - `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` closes all OpenCV windows.\n\nReplace `'path_to_your_image.jpg'` with the actual path to your image file. This script will open a window showing the image with bounding boxes drawn around detected faces.\n\n### Note:\n\n- Haar cascades can be less accurate compared to modern deep learning methods but are faster and sufficient for many use cases.\n- For better accuracy, consider using more advanced face detection models like those provided by Dlib, MTCNN, or deep learning-based models in OpenCV."
