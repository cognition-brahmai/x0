        "content": "Sure, here are three fascinating facts about the human brain:\n\n- **Neuroplasticity**: The human brain has an incredible ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This property, known as neuroplasticity, allows the brain to adapt and compensate for injury and disease and to adjust its functional organization in response to changes in the environment, behavior, and neural processes.\n\n- **Brain's Energy Consumption**: Despite making up only about 2% of the body's weight, the human brain consumes approximately 20% of the total oxygen and calories. This high metabolic demand reflects the brain's continuous activity, even during sleep, as it processes information, regulates bodily functions, and maintains consciousness.\n\n- **Memory Consolidation During Sleep**: One of the most intriguing aspects of the human brain is its ability to consolidate memories during sleep. Research has shown that sleep plays a crucial role in strengthening neural connections that form memories, especially during the deep stages of sleep known as slow-wave sleep. This process helps in retaining information learned during the day and integrating it with existing knowledge."
