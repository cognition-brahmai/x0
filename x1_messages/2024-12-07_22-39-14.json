        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a car traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out the total distance it's traveled. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the car travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, right? So, for this part, the distance should be 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nThen, the car travels at 80 miles per hour for another 3 hours. Again, using the formula distance equals speed times time, that would be 80 miles per hour times 3 hours, which equals 240 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, I just need to add those two distances together: 120 miles plus 240 miles. That gives me a total of 360 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe combining the speeds or something. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach could be to find the average speed and then multiply it by the total time. The total time traveled is 2 hours plus 3 hours, which is 5 hours.\n\nTo find the average speed, I would need to divide the total distance by the total time. But in this case, I already have the distances for each part, so adding them up seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't have the distances yet, I could calculate each part separately, as I did earlier, and then sum them up.\n\nLet me check if there's any mistake in my calculations. 60 miles per hour times 2 hours is indeed 120 miles. 80 miles per hour times 3 hours is 240 miles. Adding those gives 360 miles.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider, like acceleration or stops, but the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I think assuming constant speeds is fine.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled by the car is 360 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
