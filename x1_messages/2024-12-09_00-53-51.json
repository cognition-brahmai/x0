        "content": "Let's see. There are initially 5 apples and 3 oranges in the basket, so a total of 8 fruits. Sarah takes out 2 apples, so now there are 5 - 2 = 3 apples left. Tom takes out 1 orange, so there are 3 - 1 = 2 oranges left. So now, the basket has 3 apples and 2 oranges, making a total of 5 fruits.\n\nJohn wants to take out an apple. The probability of him picking an apple would be the number of apples left divided by the total number of fruits left. So, that's 3 apples out of 5 fruits.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/5 or 0.6, which is 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.6} \\]"
