Let's take a look at the four formations you mentioned: basalt columns, limestone caves, sandstone arches, and granite domes.\n\nFirst up, basalt columns. These are impressive structures often found in volcanic areas. Basalt is a type of igneous rock, which forms when lava cools and solidifies. What's unique about basalt columns is their distinctive polygonal shape, usually hexagonal, which forms due to the way the lava cools and contracts. Think of the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland or Devils Tower in the USA. These columns are a result of uniform cooling rates, leading to cracks propagating downward as the lava solidifies.\n\nNext, limestone caves. Limestone is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcium carbonate. Caves in limestone form through a process called karstification, where slightly acidic groundwater dissolves the limestone over time. This can create a network of underground caves, passages, and even underground rivers. Features like stalactites and stalagmites form as minerals precipitate out of dripping water over thousands of years. Examples include Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico and Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.\n\nSandstone arches are another intriguing formation. Sandstone is a sedimentary rock made up of sand-sized mineral particles or rock fragments. Arches form through a combination of deposition, erosion, and weathering. Typically, sand is deposited in layers, which over time become compacted into sandstone. Erosion, often by wind and water, carves out softer parts of the rock, leaving more resistant layers to form arches. A famous example is Delicate Arch in Arches National Park, Utah.\n\nLastly, granite domes. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock, meaning it forms from magma cooling slowly beneath the Earth's surface. Granite domes are created through a process called exfoliation, where layers of rock peel away due to pressure release as overlying rocks erode away. This can lead to the formation of rounded, dome-like structures. Yosemite National Park in California is famous for its granite domes, such as Half Dome and El Capitan.\n\nEach of these formations tells a story about the geological history and processes of the areas where they're found. From the cooling of lava to the patient work of erosion and weathering, they showcase the diverse ways in which our planet shapes itself over time.\n\n**References:**\n\n1. USGS.
