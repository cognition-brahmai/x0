        "content": "To calculate the probability that a randomly selected score falls between 70 and 80 in a normal distribution with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 5, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Normal Distribution:**\n   - The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve.\n   - It is defined by two parameters: the mean (\u03bc) and the standard deviation (\u03c3).\n   - In this case, \u03bc = 75 and \u03c3 = 5.\n\n2. **Standardize the Scores:**\n   - To find the probability between two scores, we need to convert these scores into z-scores.\n   - The z-score formula is: z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n     - Where X is the raw score.\n\n3. **Calculate z-scores for 70 and 80:**\n   - For X = 70:\n     z1 = (70 - 75) / 5 = -5 / 5 = -1\n   - For X = 80:\n     z2 = (80 - 75) / 5 = 5 / 5 = 1\n\n4. **Find the Area Under the Curve:**\n   - The probability between z1 and z2 corresponds to the area under the standard normal curve between these two z-scores.\n   - We can use a z-table (standard normal distribution table) or a calculator to find these areas.\n\n5. **Using z-table:**\n   - Look up the cumulative probability for z = 1.\n     - From the z-table, P(Z \u2264 1) \u2248 0.8413\n   - Look up the cumulative probability for z = -1.\n     - From the z-table, P(Z \u2264 -1) \u2248 0.1587\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability Between z1 and z2:**\n   - The probability between z = -1 and z = 1 is:\n     P(-1 < Z < 1) = P(Z \u2264 1) - P(Z \u2264 -1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected score falls between 70 and 80 is approximately 68.26%.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- By standardizing the scores to z-scores, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find probabilities.\n- The z-scores tell us how many standard deviations away from the mean each score is.\n- The area between these z-scores represents the probability of a score falling within that range.\n- In this case, approximately 68.26% of the scores lie within one standard deviation of the mean, which aligns with the empirical rule for normal distributions."
