        "content": "Let's see. So, the train normally travels from Town A to Town B, which is 120 miles apart, and it takes 2 hours to do that at its normal speed. So, first, I need to figure out what the normal speed of the train is.\n\nSpeed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time, right? So, normal speed would be 120 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the question is asking what would happen if the train's speed were reduced by half. So, if the normal speed is 60 mph, then half of that would be 30 mph.\n\nSo, now I need to find out how long it would take to travel the same 120 miles at 30 mph.\n\nTime is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed, so 120 miles divided by 30 mph.\n\nThat would be 4 hours.\n\nSo, if the train's speed is reduced by half, it would take 4 hours to travel from Town A to Town B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the speed is halved, meaning it's going slower, it should take longer, which makes sense because 4 hours is longer than the original 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportion. If the speed is reduced by half, the time should double, because time and speed are inversely proportional when distance is constant.\n\nSo, if the original time is 2 hours, doubling that would indeed be 4 hours.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
