        "content": "I believe the music festival you're referring to is Woodstock. It took place from August 15th to the 18th, 1969, on a dairy farm in Bethel, New York. The event was called \"An Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music\" and featured performances by iconic artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, The Who, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and many others.\n\nWoodstock is indeed considered a symbol of the counterculture and peace activism of that era. It was a pivotal moment in history, representing the ideals of peace, love, and unity that were central to the hippie movement. Despite facing challenges like bad weather and an unexpectedly large crowd, the festival is remembered for its peaceful atmosphere and the powerful musical performances.\n\nThe impact of Woodstock extended beyond the event itself, influencing music, fashion, and cultural attitudes for years to come. It's often regarded as one of the greatest music festivals of all time and a defining moment of the 1960s."
