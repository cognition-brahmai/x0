        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to implement Conway's Game of Life in Java. I've heard of it before, but I'm not super familiar with the rules. I think it's one of those cellular automata things where you have a grid of cells, and each cell can be either alive or dead, and their states change based on the states of their neighbors over time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules properly. From what I recall, the rules are something like this:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nYeah, that sounds right. So, I need to create a grid, maybe a 2D array, where each cell can be either alive or dead. I'll probably represent alive as true and dead as false.\n\nNow, how should I allow users to specify the initial state? Maybe I can take input from the console, where they can specify the dimensions of the grid and then input the initial live cells' positions.\n\nFor displaying the board, I can print it out generation by generation. Maybe use a character like 'O' for alive and '.' for dead, or something like that.\n\nI also need to automatically progress through generations until no more changes occur. That means I have to keep track of the state in each generation and check if it's the same as the previous one. If it is, then the game has reached a stable state and I can stop.\n\nAlright, let's start by planning out the steps I need to implement:\n\n1. **Get user input for the grid size and initial live cells.**\n\n2. **Create a method to display the current state of the grid.**\n\n3. **Implement the logic to compute the next generation based on the current generation.**\n\n4. **Keep track of the current and next generations to detect when the grid stops changing.**\n\n5. **Loop through generations until no changes occur.**\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Java. I'll probably create a class called GameOfLife. Inside this class, I'll have a 2D boolean array to represent the grid.\n\nI need to handle user input carefully to make sure they enter valid positions for live cells.\n\nFor displaying the grid, I'll iterate through the 2D array and print 'O' for true and '.' for false.\n\nNow, the tricky part is computing the next generation. I need to look at each cell and count its live neighbors.\n\nTo count the neighbors, for each cell, I'll check the eight surrounding cells (if they exist) and count how many are alive.\n\nBased on the neighbor count and the current cell's state, I'll determine its state in the next generation.\n\nI need to be careful here because I can't change the grid while I'm still reading from it, otherwise, the counts will be incorrect. So, I'll need to create a new grid for the next generation and update that based on the current grid's state.\n\nOnce I have the next generation, I'll check if it's the same as the current generation. If it is, I'll stop. Otherwise, I'll set the current generation to the next one and repeat.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like entirely dead grids or grids where all cells are alive.\n\nAlright, let's start coding. I'll begin by setting up the class and getting user input for the grid size.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement Conway's Game of Life in Java, we need to create a program that simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules. The program should allow users to specify the initial state of the grid and automatically progress through generations until no more changes occur.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **User Input:**\n   - Accept the grid size and initial live cells from the user.\n\n2. **Grid Representation:**\n   - Use a 2D boolean array where `true` represents a live cell and `false` represents a dead cell.\n\n3. **Display Grid:**\n   - Print the grid state using 'O' for live cells and '.' for dead cells.\n\n4. **Next Generation:**\n   - Compute the next generation based on the current generation using the rules of Conway's Game of Life.\n   - Use a separate grid to store the next generation to avoid interference between computations.\n\n5. **Check for Stability:**\n   - Compare the current generation with the next generation to determine if the grid has reached a stable state.\n\n6. **Loop Through Generations:**\n   - Continue progressing through generations until no changes occur.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class GameOfLife {\n    private boolean[][] grid;\n    private int rows, cols;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new GameOfLife().run();\n    }\n\n    public void run() {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Get grid dimensions\n        System.out.println(\"Enter number of rows:\");\n        rows = scanner.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(\"Enter number of columns:\");\n        cols = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        // Initialize grid\n        grid = new boolean[rows][cols];\n\n        // Get initial live cells\n        System.out.println(\"Enter initial live cells (row col), type 'done' when finished.\");\n        while (true) {\n            String input = scanner.next();\n            if (input.equals(\"done\")) {\n                break;\n            }\n            int row = scanner.nextInt();\n            int col = scanner.nextInt();\n            setLiveCell(row, col);\n        }\n\n        // Run the game\n        runGame();\n    }\n\n    private void setLiveCell(int row, int col) {\n        if (row >= 0 && row < rows && col >= 0 && col < cols) {\n            grid[row][col] = true;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid cell position.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void runGame() {\n        boolean[][] nextGrid;\n        do {\n            displayGrid();\n            nextGrid = computeNextGeneration();\n        } while (!isSame(nextGrid));\n        displayGrid();\n        System.out.println(\"No more changes. Final state reached.\");\n    }\n\n    private boolean[][] computeNextGeneration() {\n        boolean[][] newGrid = new boolean[rows][cols];\n        for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {\n            for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {\n                int liveNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors(row, col);\n                if (grid[row][col]) {\n                    // Live cell\n                    if (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3) {\n                        newGrid[row][col] = false;\n                    } else {\n                        newGrid[row][col] = true;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // Dead cell\n                    if (liveNeighbors == 3) {\n                        newGrid[row][col] = true;\n                    } else {\n                        newGrid[row][col] = false;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return newGrid;\n    }\n\n    private int countLiveNeighbors(int row, int col) {\n        int count = 0;\n        for (int r = Math.max(0, row - 1); r <= Math.min(rows - 1, row + 1); r++) {\n            for (int c = Math.max(0, col - 1); c <= Math.min(cols - 1, col + 1); c++) {\n                if (r == row && c == col) continue;\n                if (grid[r][c]) count++;\n            }\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    private boolean isSame(boolean[][] nextGrid) {\n        for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {\n            for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {\n                if (grid[row][col] != nextGrid[row][col]) {\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    private void displayGrid() {\n        for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {\n            for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {\n                System.out.print(grid[row][col] ? \"O \" : \". \");\n            }\n            System.out.println();\n        }\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **User Input:**\n   - The user specifies the number of rows and columns for the grid.\n   - The user then inputs the positions of live cells, typing \"done\" when finished.\n\n2. **Grid Representation:**\n   - A 2D boolean array `grid` represents the grid, where `true` is a live cell and `false` is a dead cell.\n\n3. **Display Grid:**\n   - The `displayGrid` method prints the current state of the grid using 'O' for live cells and '.' for dead cells.\n\n4. **Next Generation:**\n   - The `computeNextGeneration` method creates a new grid based on the current grid's state using the rules of Conway's Game of Life.\n\n5. **Check for Stability:**\n   - The `isSame` method compares the current grid with the next grid to check if they are identical.\n\n6. **Loop Through Generations:**\n   - The `runGame` method continues to compute and display new generations until the grid stops changing, indicating a stable state.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic version of Conway's Game of Life, allowing users to observe the evolution of cellular automata based on simple rules."
