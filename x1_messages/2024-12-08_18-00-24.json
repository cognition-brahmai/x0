        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people with twice as many women as men, and there are 24 more women than men. We need to find out how many people are in the group in total.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say the number of men in the group is M, and the number of women is W.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are twice as many women as men. So, we can write that as:\n\nW = 2M\n\nAlso, it's stated that there are 24 more women than men. That can be expressed as:\n\nW = M + 24\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. W = 2M\n\n2. W = M + 24\n\nSince both expressions equal W, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n2M = M + 24\n\nNow, let's solve for M. Subtract M from both sides:\n\n2M - M = M + 24 - M\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nM = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 men in the group.\n\nNow, we can find the number of women using the first equation:\n\nW = 2M = 2 * 24 = 48\n\nTherefore, there are 48 women in the group.\n\nTo find the total number of people in the group, we add the number of men and women together:\n\nTotal people = M + W = 24 + 48 = 72\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Number of men (M) = 24\n\n- Number of women (W) = 2 * 24 = 48\n\n- Total people = 24 + 48 = 72\n\nBut, the problem says there are 24 more women than men. Let's verify if that holds true:\n\nNumber of women - Number of men = 48 - 24 = 24\n\nYes, that matches the given information.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it differently. If there are twice as many women as men, and 24 more women than men, we can set up the equations as before and arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nSo, the total number of people in the group is 72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
