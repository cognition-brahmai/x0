I'm going to create a CSV file that includes the names of the eight planets in our solar system, their average distances from the Sun, and the number of moons each has. I'll make sure to provide accurate information based on current astronomical data.\n\nFirst, I need to gather the necessary data for each planet. I'll list the planets in order from the Sun, starting with Mercury and ending with Neptune, as Pluto is no longer classified as a planet but rather as a dwarf planet.\n\n1. **Mercury**\n   - Average distance from the Sun: approximately 57.91 million kilometers\n   - Number of moons: 0\n\n2. **Venus**\n   - Average distance from the Sun: approximately 108.2 million kilometers\n   - Number of moons: 0\n\n3. **Earth**\n   - Average distance from the Sun: approximately 149.6 million kilometers\n   - Number of moons: 1\n\n4. **Mars**\n   - Average distance from the Sun: approximately 227.9 million kilometers\n   - Number of moons: 2\n\n5. **Jupiter**\n   - Average distance from the Sun: approximately 778.3 million kilometers\n   - Number of moons: Over 79 confirmed moons\n\n6. **Saturn**\n   - Average distance from the Sun: approximately 1.427 billion kilometers\n   - Number of moons: Over 82 confirmed moons\n\n7. **Uranus**\n   - Average distance from the Sun: approximately 2.871 billion kilometers\n   - Number of moons: 27\n\n8. **Neptune**\n   - Average distance from the Sun: approximately 4.497 billion kilometers\n   - Number of moons: 14\n\nNow, I'll structure this data into a CSV format. CSV stands for \"Comma-Separated Values,\" which is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line represents a data record, and fields within the record are separated by commas.\n\nHere's how the CSV file will look:\n\n```\nPlanet,Average Distance from Sun (km),Number of Moons\nMercury,57910000,0\nVenus,108200000,0\nEarth,149600000,1\nMars,227900000,2\nJupiter,778300000,79\nSaturn,1427000000,82\nUranus,2871000000,27\nNeptune,4497000000,14\n```\n\nI've included the planet names, their average distances from the Sun in kilometers, and the number of moons they have. For Jupiter and Saturn, the number of moons is approximate, as the exact count can change with new discoveries.\n\nIf you need this information in a different format or have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
