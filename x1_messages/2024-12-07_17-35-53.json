        "content": "So the farmer has 15 sheep, and each sheep gives 3 liters of milk per day. We need to find out how many liters of milk the farmer will get in a month, assuming a month has 30 days.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how much milk one sheep gives in a day and then multiply that by the number of sheep to get the total milk per day. After that, I'll multiply the daily total by the number of days in a month.\n\nSo, one sheep gives 3 liters per day. With 15 sheep, the total milk per day would be:\n\n3 liters/sheep/day \u00d7 15 sheep = 45 liters/day\n\nNow, for a month with 30 days, the total milk would be:\n\n45 liters/day \u00d7 30 days = 1350 liters\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the milk production, like holidays or something. But the problem doesn't mention any such things, so I think assuming a constant production rate is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the farmer sells some sheep during the month or buys more, but again, the problem doesn't mention any changes in the number of sheep, so I'll assume the number remains constant at 15.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all sheep produce milk every day. Maybe some sheep take rest days or something. But again, the problem states each sheep gives 3 liters per day, so I'll take that as a given.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation:\n\n15 sheep \u00d7 3 liters/sheep/day \u00d7 30 days = 1350 liters\n\nI can also break it down differently to verify. For example, calculate the monthly production per sheep and then multiply by the number of sheep.\n\nMonthly production per sheep: 3 liters/day \u00d7 30 days = 90 liters/sheep/month\n\nTotal for 15 sheep: 90 liters/sheep/month \u00d7 15 sheep = 1350 liters/month\n\nSame result, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of total milk per day and then extend it to the month.\n\nTotal daily milk: 15 sheep \u00d7 3 liters/sheep/day = 45 liters/day\n\nTotal monthly milk: 45 liters/day \u00d7 30 days = 1350 liters\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result. There doesn't seem to be any trick or additional considerations in the problem as stated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1350} \\]"
