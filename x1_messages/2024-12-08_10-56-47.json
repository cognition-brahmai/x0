        "content": "Alright, I need to find out the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I have a few tools at my disposal: an encyclopedia, a QA tool, an animal database, a fact checker, and a data comparer. The animal database seems particularly relevant since it's specialized for animal information.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Start with the AnimalDatabase** to get specific information about African elephants, particularly their lifespan in the wild.\n\n**#E1 = AnimalDatabase[\"African elephant lifespan in the wild\"]**\n\n2. **Check the Encyclopedia** as a secondary source to confirm the information from the animal database.\n\n**#E2 = Encyclopedia[\"African elephant lifespan\"]**\n\n3. **Use QA tool** to interpret and compare the information from both sources.\n\n**#E3 = QA[\"What is the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild, based on #E1 and #E2?\"]**\n\n4. **FactChecker** to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the animal database and the encyclopedia.\n\n**#E4 = FactChecker[#E1] and FactChecker[#E2]**\n\n5. **DataComparer** to determine which source is more accurate if there are discrepancies.\n\n**#E5 = DataComparer[#E1, #E2]**\n\n6. **Final Answer:** Based on the compared and verified information, provide the average lifespan.\n\n**Final Answer: #E3, considering the verification from #E4 and comparison from #E5.**\n\nThis plan should ensure that I get accurate and reliable information about the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild."
