        "content": "So the factory produces 1000 widgets per day, but on Mondays, they produce twice as many as on Sundays. And the question is, how many do they produce on Tuesdays? Hmm, the problem is a bit confusing because it says they produce 1000 widgets per day, but then specifies that on Mondays, they produce twice as many as on Sundays. So, maybe the daily production isn't always 1000 widgets?\n\nLet me try to rephrase this to understand better. If the factory produces 1000 widgets per day normally, but on Mondays, they produce twice as many as on Sundays, then perhaps Sundays are the days they produce less.\n\nWait, or maybe the 1000 widgets per day is the average daily production. But the problem doesn't specify that. It just says \"produces 1000 widgets per day,\" which seems straightforward, but the mention of Mondays and Sundays complicates it.\n\nPerhaps, the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays and Sundays. On Sundays, they produce X widgets, and on Mondays, they produce 2X widgets. But that seems like an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on weekdays (Monday to Friday), and on Sundays, they produce less, and on Mondays, they produce twice as many as on Sundays.\n\nBut the problem mentions only Mondays and Sundays, so perhaps the production varies only on these two days.\n\nLet me try to set up some equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let S be the number of widgets produced on Sundays.\n\n- Then, on Mondays, they produce 2S widgets.\n\n- On other days (Monday to Saturday, excluding Monday), they produce 1000 widgets per day.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a factory produces 1000 widgets per day. On Mondays, they produce twice as many widgets as on Sundays.\" It doesn't specify anything about other days.\n\nSo maybe, the factory always produces 1000 widgets per day, except on Mondays and Sundays, where the production is different.\n\nBut it's unclear. Perhaps, the base production is 1000 widgets per day, and on Mondays, they produce twice as many as on Sundays, but we need more information to determine the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory produces 1000 widgets per day from Tuesday to Saturday, and on Sundays, they produce S widgets, and on Mondays, they produce 2S widgets.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps we can find S in terms of the total weekly production, but the problem doesn't provide the total weekly production.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the number of widgets produced on Tuesdays. According to the initial statement, the factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and unless specified otherwise, perhaps Tuesdays are regular days with 1000 widgets.\n\nBut the problem seems to imply that there are different production rates on different days, but it only specifies Mondays and Sundays.\n\nLet me consider that the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays and Sundays, where Mondays have twice the production of Sundays.\n\nLet S be the number of widgets produced on Sundays.\n\nThen, on Mondays, the production is 2S.\n\nOn other days (Tuesday to Saturday), production is 1000 widgets per day.\n\nNow, the total weekly production would be:\n\n- Mondays: 2S\n\n- Sundays: S\n\n- Tuesday to Saturday: 1000 * 5 = 5000\n\nSo, total weekly production = 2S + S + 5000 = 3S + 5000\n\nBut without knowing the total weekly production, I can't solve for S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on Sundays, and twice that on Mondays.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"produces 1000 widgets per day. On Mondays, they produce twice as many widgets as on Sundays.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the base production is 1000 widgets per day, and on Mondays, they produce 2 * Sunday's production.\n\nIf Sunday's production is S, then Monday's production is 2S.\n\nBut if the base production is 1000 per day, maybe S = 1000, and on Mondays, they produce 2 * 1000 = 2000.\n\nIn that case, Tuesdays would be the base production of 1000 widgets.\n\nBut this seems too straightforward, and perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average daily production is 1000 widgets, and there are variations on Mondays and Sundays.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on Mondays, which is twice what they produce on Sundays. So, if Monday's production is 1000, then Sunday's production is 500.\n\nBut then, what about the other days? Do they produce 1000 widgets per day, or is Monday the only day with 1000?\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the factory's normal production day is 1000 widgets, which applies to all days except Mondays and Sundays.\n\nOn Sundays, they produce S widgets, and on Mondays, they produce 2S widgets.\n\nThen, the total weekly production is:\n\n- Monday: 2S\n\n- Sunday: S\n\n- Tuesday to Saturday: 1000 * 5 = 5000\n\n- Total: 2S + S + 5000 = 3S + 5000\n\nBut without knowing the total weekly production, I can't solve for S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends for us to assume that the 1000 widgets per day is the production on Sundays, and on Mondays, they produce twice that amount.\n\nIn that case, Sunday's production is 1000, Monday's production is 2 * 1000 = 2000, and other days are also 1000.\n\nTherefore, Tuesday's production would be 1000 widgets.\n\nBut I feel like there might be more to this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory produces a total of 1000 widgets per day on average, and we need to find out the production on Tuesdays given the relationship between Mondays and Sundays.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory produces 1000 widgets per day every day, except on Mondays, where they produce twice as many as on Sundays.\n\nBut unless I know what they produce on Sundays, I can't determine Monday's production.\n\nThis is getting too unclear.\n\nMaybe I should just assume that the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays, where they produce twice as many as on Sundays, and assume that on Sundays, they produce a different amount.\n\nBut without additional information, I can't solve for the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to test my ability to recognize that, given the information provided, it's impossible to determine the exact production on Tuesdays without knowing the production on Sundays.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it, and the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays, where they produce twice as many as on Sundays, and I'm supposed to assume that Sundays have a different production rate.\n\nBut without more information, I can't determine the exact number for Tuesdays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misphrased, and it's intended that the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on Mondays, which is twice what they produce on Sundays.\n\nIn that case, Sunday's production would be 1000 / 2 = 500 widgets, and Tuesday's production would be the normal daily production, which is 1000 widgets.\n\nBut again, this seems like an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory produces 1000 widgets per day overall, meaning the average daily production is 1000 widgets, and on Mondays, they produce twice as many as on Sundays.\n\nIn that case, let's denote S as Sunday's production, and 2S as Monday's production, and the average of all seven days is 1000.\n\nSo, total weekly production is 7 * 1000 = 7000 widgets.\n\nThen, the sum of productions from Monday to Sunday should be 7000.\n\nAssuming Tuesday to Saturday productions are all equal to T.\n\nSo, Monday: 2S\n\nSunday: S\n\nTuesday to Saturday: T * 5\n\nTotal: 2S + S + 5T = 7000\n\nWhich simplifies to 3S + 5T = 7000\n\nBut with two variables, I can't solve for S and T without another equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays and Sundays, where Mondays have twice the production of Sundays.\n\nIn that case, let's denote Sunday's production as S, and Monday's production as 2S.\n\nThen, Tuesday to Saturday productions are 1000 each.\n\nTotal weekly production: 2S + S + 5*1000 = 3S + 5000\n\nBut without knowing the total weekly production, I can't solve for S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory produces a total of 1000 widgets per day, meaning that the combined production of all days is 1000 widgets per day, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should just assume that the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays, where they produce twice as many as on Sundays, and assume that Sundays have a different production rate.\n\nBut without more information, I can't determine the exact production on Tuesdays.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be that the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays, where they produce twice the daily average.\n\nBut that would require calculating the daily average, which again depends on the production on Sundays.\n\nThis is too ambiguous.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the simplest assumption is that the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays, where they produce twice the amount they produce on Sundays, and that Sundays have a different production rate.\n\nBut without more specifics, I can't determine the exact production on Tuesdays.\n\nHowever, if I assume that the factory produces 1000 widgets per day on all days except Mondays, where they produce twice the amount of Sundays, and if Sundays have a production of S, then Mondays have 2S.\n\nBut unless I know S, I can't determine the production on Tuesdays, which is presumably 1000 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to test that the production on Tuesdays is the same as the normal daily production, which is 1000 widgets, given that only Mondays and Sundays have different productions.\n\nBut again, without knowing the production on Sundays, I can't be sure.\n\nGiven all this confusion, I think the answer is that the factory produces 1000 widgets on Tuesdays, assuming that Tuesdays are a normal production day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
