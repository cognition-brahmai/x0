        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a city of 500,000 residents, 75% own a car. Of those who own a car, 20% also own a bicycle. I need to find out how many residents own both a car and a bicycle. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many people own a car. Since 75% of the 500,000 residents own a car, I can calculate that by multiplying 500,000 by 75%. But remember, 75% is the same as 0.75 in decimal form. So, the number of car owners is 500,000 times 0.75.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 500,000 \u00d7 0.75 = 375,000. So, 375,000 residents own a car.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these car owners also own a bicycle. The problem says that 20% of car owners also own a bicycle. Again, 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form. So, I need to multiply the number of car owners by 0.20 to find out how many own both a car and a bicycle.\n\nSo, that's 375,000 \u00d7 0.20. Let's calculate that: 375,000 \u00d7 0.20 = 75,000.\n\nTherefore, 75,000 residents own both a car and a bicycle.\n\nTo summarize, I first found the number of car owners by taking 75% of the total population, which is 375,000. Then, I found the number of people who own both a car and a bicycle by taking 20% of the car owners, which is 75,000.\n\nI think that makes sense. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?\n\nWell, another way could be to consider the total population and the percentages directly. So, if 75% own a car and of those, 20% own a bicycle, then the percentage of the total population that owns both a car and a bicycle would be 75% times 20%.\n\nLet's calculate that: 75% \u00d7 20% = 0.75 \u00d7 0.20 = 0.15, which is 15%. So, 15% of the total population owns both a car and a bicycle.\n\nNow, 15% of 500,000 is 500,000 \u00d7 0.15 = 75,000. That matches the earlier result, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of sets. Let\u2019s say the total population is the universal set, and let C be the set of car owners, and B be the set of bicycle owners. We are given that |C| = 75% of 500,000 = 375,000, and that 20% of car owners also own a bicycle, which is |C \u2229 B| = 20% of |C| = 20% of 375,000 = 75,000.\n\nAgain, that confirms the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider whether there\u2019s any overlap or other factors to consider, but the problem is straightforward. It\u2019s only about car and bicycle ownership, and there\u2019s no information suggesting any other variables or dependencies.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is 75,000 residents own both a car and a bicycle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
