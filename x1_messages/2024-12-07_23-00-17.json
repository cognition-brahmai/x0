        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 12 red balls and 8 blue balls, making a total of 20 balls. I need to find the probability of picking one red and one blue ball when I draw two balls without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I pick a ball, it stays out, and the total number of balls decreases by one each time I pick. So, the probabilities might change with each draw.\n\nNow, the problem is to pick one red and one blue ball in any order. That means I could pick a red ball first and then a blue ball, or a blue ball first and then a red ball. Both scenarios should be considered.\n\nLet me consider the first scenario: picking a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that's 12 red out of 20 total balls, which is 12/20 or simplified to 3/5.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 11 red balls left and still 8 blue balls, making a total of 19 balls left in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a blue ball next is 8 blue out of 19 total balls, which is 8/19.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red first and then a blue is (3/5) * (8/19).\n\nNow, let's consider the second scenario: picking a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\nThe probability of picking a blue ball first is 8 blue out of 20 total balls, which is 8/20 or simplified to 2/5.\n\nAfter picking one blue ball, there are still 12 red balls and 7 blue balls left, making a total of 19 balls.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball next is 12 red out of 19 total balls, which is 12/19.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a blue first and then a red is (2/5) * (12/19).\n\nSince both scenarios are possible and mutually exclusive (you can't have both at the same time), I need to add these two probabilities together to get the total probability of picking one red and one blue ball.\n\nSo, total probability = (3/5 * 8/19) + (2/5 * 12/19).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 3/5 * 8/19 = (3*8)/(5*19) = 24/95.\n\nSecond, 2/5 * 12/19 = (2*12)/(5*19) = 24/95.\n\nNow, adding them together: 24/95 + 24/95 = 48/95.\n\nSo, the probability is 48/95.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using combinations?\n\nYes, I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 20 is C(20,2), which is 20 choose 2.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick 1 red out of 12 and 1 blue out of 8 is C(12,1) * C(8,1).\n\nSo, the probability is [C(12,1) * C(8,1)] / C(20,2).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nC(12,1) = 12.\n\nC(8,1) = 8.\n\nC(20,2) = (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nSo, probability = (12 * 8) / 190 = 96 / 190.\n\nSimplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 48/95.\n\nSame answer as before, which is good.\n\nSo, the probability is 48/95.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I think about the order not mattering. Since the problem says \"one red and one blue ball\" without specifying order, maybe I can calculate it directly without considering order.\n\nUsing combinations makes sense because order doesn't matter in this case.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider order, I have to account for both possible sequences, as I did earlier.\n\nBut using combinations simplifies it because it inherently accounts for the different orders.\n\nWait, actually, in the first approach, I considered order by looking at red then blue and blue then red as separate events, and added their probabilities.\n\nIn the combinations approach, order doesn't matter because C(12,1)*C(8,1) gives me the number of ways to pick one red and one blue, regardless of order.\n\nSo both approaches are valid, just different ways of thinking about the problem.\n\nI think I've covered it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the final answer is 48/95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{48}{95}} \\]"
