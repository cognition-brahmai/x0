        "content": "In the shadows where the raven croaks,\nStands a mountain, tall and bleak.\nIts peaks are crowned with snow,\nWhere the winds do endlessly blow,\nA tomb for dreams, a nightmare's peak.\n\nIn the valley, whispers softly spoke,\nOf ancient tales that time has broke.\nThe mountain, grim and cold,\nHears the echoes that are old,\nAnd in its heart, the darkness woke.\n\nOh, mountain dark, with sorrow steeped,\nYour slopes with mystery are steeped.\nNo joy nor love can dwell,\nOnly shadows, cold and fell,\nIn your realm, forever reaped.\n\nYet, in the moon's pale, silv'ry light,\nYou seem to hold a ghastly might.\nYour crags reach up to sky,\nWhere the stars in silence lie,\nA specter in the night's respite.\n\nSo here I stand, before your might,\nFeeling small, yet filled with fright.\nFor in your stone, I see,\nA mirror of eternity,\nAnd in your silence, my own plight.\n\nNote: This limerick attempts to capture the dark, melancholic, and gothic atmosphere characteristic of Edgar Allan Poe's writing style, while describing a mountain as the central element."
