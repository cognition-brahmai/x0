        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people with an equal number of men and women. That means if there are, say, 10 men, there are also 10 women, making a total of 20 people in the group.\n\nNow, 60% of the men wear glasses. So, if there are 10 men, then 60% of 10 is 6 men wearing glasses.\n\nSimilarly, 40% of the women wear glasses. So, if there are 10 women, then 40% of 10 is 4 women wearing glasses.\n\nSo, in total, there are 6 men + 4 women = 10 people wearing glasses.\n\nSince the total number of people in the group is 20, the percentage of the entire group that wears glasses is (10 / 20) * 100% = 50%.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this makes sense. I used specific numbers here, but actually, the problem doesn't specify the total number of people. So, maybe I should use variables to make sure this works in general.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of men as m and the number of women as w. According to the problem, m = w.\n\nSo, the total number of people is m + w = 2m (since m = w).\n\nNow, 60% of the men wear glasses, which is 0.6m.\n\n40% of the women wear glasses, which is 0.4w.\n\nBut since m = w, this is 0.4m.\n\nSo, the total number of people wearing glasses is 0.6m + 0.4m = 1.0m.\n\nThe total number of people is 2m.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the entire group wearing glasses is (1.0m / 2m) * 100% = 50%.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, no matter how many men and women there are, as long as their numbers are equal, the percentage of the group wearing glasses is 50%.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using weights or averages.\n\nSince the number of men and women is equal, we can think of the overall percentage as the average of the percentages of men and women wearing glasses.\n\nSo, average percentage = (60% + 40%) / 2 = 50%.\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of men and women weren't equal, we'd have to weight the percentages according to their proportions in the group. But in this case, since they're equal, it's simply the average.\n\nWait, but in general, when groups are of different sizes, we need to take into account the size of each group when calculating the overall percentage. But here, since they're equal, it simplifies to the average.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 50% of the entire group wears glasses.\n\nLet me just consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The problem states that the group has an equal number of men and women, and specifies the percentages of each subgroup wearing glasses. Seems straightforward.\n\nI think 50% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50\\%} \\]"
