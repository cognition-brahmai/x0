        "content": "So there are 120 students in the school. 75% of them play soccer, and 40% play basketball. I need to find the minimum number of students who play both sports.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how many students play soccer. 75% of 120 is:\n\n0.75 * 120 = 90 students\n\nNext, the number of students who play basketball is 40% of 120:\n\n0.40 * 120 = 48 students\n\nNow, to find the minimum number of students who play both sports, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe total number of students who play either soccer or basketball or both is:\n\nNumber playing soccer + Number playing basketball - Number playing both\n\nLet's denote the number playing both as x.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal playing either or both = 90 + 48 - x = 138 - x\n\nBut, since there are only 120 students in total, the number playing either or both can't exceed 120.\n\nTherefore,\n\n138 - x \u2264 120\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx \u2265 138 - 120\n\nx \u2265 18\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who play both soccer and basketball is 18.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that fewer students play both sports? Let me think about this again.\n\nIf 90 students play soccer and 48 play basketball, the total number of sport participations is 90 + 48 = 138. But since there are only 120 students, at least 138 - 120 = 18 students must be counted in both groups.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number who play both is indeed 18.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that some students might not play either sport, but the question doesn't mention that. It seems that all students play at least one sport, but to confirm:\n\nIf some students don't play either sport, that would increase the possible overlap. But since we're looking for the minimum number who play both, assuming no students play neither would give us the minimum overlap.\n\nWait, actually, if some students don't play either sport, that would allow for a smaller overlap.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that all students play at least one sport.\n\nSo, to find the minimum number who play both, perhaps some students don't play either sport.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- S = number playing soccer = 90\n\n- B = number playing basketball = 48\n\n- N = total students = 120\n\n- Both = number playing both sports\n\n- Neither = number playing neither sport\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion again:\n\nS + B - Both + Neither = N\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n90 + 48 - Both + Neither = 120\n\n138 - Both + Neither = 120\n\nBoth - Neither = 18\n\nTo minimize Both, I need to maximize Neither.\n\nBut Neither can be at most the number of students who don't play soccer, which is 120 - 90 = 30, or the number who don't play basketball, which is 120 - 48 = 72.\n\nActually, Neither can be at most the smaller of these two, which is 30.\n\nWait, no. Neither can be at most 72, but in reality, it's limited by the number of students who don't play soccer.\n\nWait, to maximize Neither, I need to consider how many students are not playing either sport.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum Neither can be is 30, because only 90 play soccer, so up to 30 students could be not playing soccer. However, since 48 play basketball, up to 72 could be not playing basketball.\n\nBut to maximize Neither, it would be the number of students who are not playing soccer, which is 30, because even if all 72 who don't play basketball are included in those 30, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe minimum number of students who play both sports occurs when the number of students who play neither sport is maximized.\n\nSo, to maximize Neither, I need as many students as possible to not play either sport.\n\nThe number of students who don't play soccer is 120 - 90 = 30.\n\nTherefore, up to 30 students could be not playing soccer, and among these, some could also not play basketball.\n\nBut, since 48 students play basketball, the number who don't play basketball is 120 - 48 = 72.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who play neither sport is limited by the number who don't play soccer, which is 30.\n\nTherefore, Neither can be at most 30.\n\nPlugging back into the equation:\n\nBoth = 138 - 120 + Neither = 18 + Neither\n\nSince Neither can be at most 30, Both can be at least 18.\n\nWait, but if Neither is 18, then Both would be 18 + 18 = 36.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier equation:\n\nBoth - Neither = 18\n\nTherefore, Both = 18 + Neither\n\nTo minimize Both, set Neither to its maximum possible value, which is 30.\n\nThen, Both = 18 + 30 = 48\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because if Neither is 30, and Both is 48, then the total number of students playing at least one sport is 120 - 30 = 90.\n\nBut according to inclusion-exclusion:\n\nS + B - Both = 90 + 48 - 48 = 90, which matches.\n\nBut is there a way to have Both less than 48?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the maximum Neither.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf Neither can be at most 30, then Both = 18 + Neither, so Both can be at least 18 + 0 = 18.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Both = 18 + Neither.\n\nWait, no, from the equation:\n\nS + B - Both + Neither = N\n\n138 - Both + Neither = 120\n\nTherefore, Both - Neither = 18\n\nSo, Both = 18 + Neither\n\nTo minimize Both, set Neither to its maximum possible value.\n\nBut what's the maximum value of Neither?\n\nNeither can be at most 30, as only 90 play soccer.\n\nBut, if Neither is 30, then Both = 18 + 30 = 48\n\nBut, 48 is the number of students who play basketball, so it makes sense.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nEarlier, I thought the minimum Both is 18, but now it seems like Both could be up to 48.\n\nBut the question is to find the minimum number who play both.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nThe minimum number of students who play both sports would occur when as many students as possible play only one sport.\n\nSo, if we have 90 playing soccer and 48 playing basketball, the minimum overlap would be when as many as possible are in only one sport.\n\nThe total number of sport participations is 90 + 48 = 138.\n\nBut there are only 120 students.\n\nSo, at least 138 - 120 = 18 students must be counted in both sports.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number who play both is 18.\n\nIf some students play neither sport, that would allow for a larger overlap.\n\nWait, no, if some students play neither sport, that would allow for more students to be not playing any sport, but the overlap would still be at least 18.\n\nWait, no, actually, if some students play neither sport, that would allow for a smaller overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that.\n\nLet me consider that some students play neither sport.\n\nLet\u2019s say x students play neither sport.\n\nThen, the number of students playing at least one sport is 120 - x.\n\nThe total number of sport participations is 90 + 48 = 138.\n\nBut since some students play both sports, the number of unique students playing at least one sport is 90 + 48 - both.\n\nSo,\n\n90 + 48 - both = 120 - x\n\nTherefore,\n\n138 - both = 120 - x\n\nBoth = 138 - 120 + x\n\nBoth = 18 + x\n\nSo, the number of students playing both sports is 18 plus the number of students playing neither sport.\n\nTo minimize Both, we need to minimize x, which is the number of students playing neither sport.\n\nWait, but to minimize Both, we need to maximize x.\n\nWait, no, according to the equation, Both = 18 + x.\n\nSo, to minimize Both, we need to minimize x.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nLet me derive it again.\n\nFrom inclusion-exclusion:\n\nNumber playing at least one sport = S + B - Both\n\nAlso, number playing at least one sport = total students - Neither\n\nSo,\n\nS + B - Both = N - Neither\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n90 + 48 - Both = 120 - Neither\n\n138 - Both = 120 - Neither\n\nBoth = 138 - 120 + Neither\n\nBoth = 18 + Neither\n\nTherefore, Both = 18 + Neither\n\nTo minimize Both, we need to minimize Neither.\n\nBut Neither can be as low as 0.\n\nSo, the minimum Both is 18 + 0 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of students who play both sports is 18.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if Neither is maximized, Both increases.\n\nBut according to this equation, Both increases as Neither increases.\n\nSo, to minimize Both, set Neither to 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimum Both is 18.\n\nBut let's think about it again.\n\nIf Neither is 0, meaning all students play at least one sport, then Both = 18.\n\nIf some students play neither sport, say x students, then Both = 18 + x.\n\nSo, the more students play neither sport, the higher the Both becomes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum Both occurs when x = 0, so Both = 18.\n\nHence, the minimum number of students who play both soccer and basketball is 18.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
