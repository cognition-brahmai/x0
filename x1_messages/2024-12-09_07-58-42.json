        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you classify these domestic cat breeds based on their size. Here's how they generally stack up:\n\n1. **Maine Coon**: This is one of the largest domestic cat breeds. Males can weigh between 13 to 18 pounds, and females between 8 to 12 pounds. So, definitely a large breed.\n\n2. **Siamese**: Siamese cats are typically medium-sized. Adults usually weigh between 8 to 12 pounds. They have a lean, elegant build.\n\n3. **Persian**: Persians are also considered medium-sized cats. They usually weigh between 7 to 12 pounds. However, their dense coat might make them appear larger.\n\n4. **Bengal**: Bengals are known for their wild appearance but are generally medium to large in size. Males can weigh up to 15 pounds, while females are slightly smaller, around 10 pounds.\n\n5. **Sphynx**: Sphynx cats are small to medium-sized. They typically weigh between 6 to 11 pounds. Their hairlessness gives them a unique appearance.\n\n6. **Scottish Fold**: This breed is generally considered small to medium-sized. Adults usually weigh between 6 to 13 pounds, but they have a compact, rounded body shape.\n\n7. **Ragdoll**: Ragdolls are large cats, similar to Maine Coons. Males can weigh up to 20 pounds, and females up to 15 pounds. They have a sturdy build and long bodies.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- **Large**: Maine Coon, Ragdoll\n\n- **Medium**: Siamese, Persian, Bengal\n\n- **Small to Medium**: Sphynx, Scottish Fold\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
