It prompts the user to enter a string, then counts and displays the number of vowels and consonants in that string.\n\n```ruby\ndef count_vowels_and_consonants(str)\n  vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n  vowel_count = 0\n  consonant_count = 0\n\n  str.each_char do |char|\n    if vowels.include?(char)\n      vowel_count += 1\n    elsif char.match(/[a-zA-Z]/)\n      consonant_count += 1\n    end\n  end\n\n  puts \"Number of vowels: #{vowel_count}\"\n  puts \"Number of consonants: #{consonant_count}\"\nend\n\nprint \"Enter a string: \"\ninput_string = gets.chomp\ncount_vowels_and_consonants(input_string)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The `count_vowels_and_consonants` function takes a string as input.\n2. **Vowel and Consonant Identification**:\n   - Vowels are checked using the string `'aeiouAEIOU'`.\n   - Consonants are identified as alphabetic characters that are not vowels.\n3. **Counting**:\n   - `vowel_count` increments for each vowel found.\n   - `consonant_count` increments for each consonant found.\n4. **Output**: The function prints the counts of vowels and consonants.\n5. **User Input**: The script prompts the user to enter a string, reads the input, and passes it to the function.\n\nThis script ensures that only alphabetic characters are considered for counting vowels and consonants, ignoring digits, punctuation, and whitespace."
