        "content": "This is a classic logic puzzle, and I've encountered similar ones before. Let me think this through carefully.\n\nSo, there are two doors: one leads to certain death, and the other to riches. Two guards: one always tells the truth, and the other always lies. I don't know which is which, and I can only ask one question to one guard.\n\nMy goal is to figure out which door leads to the riches by asking a single question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider that whichever guard I ask could either be the truth-teller or the liar. So, the response I get will depend on who I'm asking.\n\nLet's think about asking directly: \"Which door leads to the riches?\" If I ask the truth-teller, I'll get the correct door. If I ask the liar, I'll get the wrong door. But since I don't know who's who, I can't rely on the direct answer.\n\nMaybe I need to ask a question that both guards will point me to the same door, but one will point to the correct one and the other to the wrong one. But that doesn't help me distinguish.\n\nWait, perhaps I should ask about what the other guard would say. That might create a situation where both guards point me to the same door, but in opposite ways.\n\nLet's try formulating that. Suppose I ask one guard: \"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to the riches, what would he say?\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. I ask the truth-teller:\n\n- The truth-teller knows the liar would point to the wrong door.\n\n- So, the truth-teller would accurately tell me that the liar would point to the wrong door.\n\n2. I ask the liar:\n\n- The liar knows that the truth-teller would point to the correct door.\n\n- But since the liar lies, he would tell me the opposite, saying that the truth-teller would point to the wrong door.\n\nWait a minute. In both cases, I'm being told that the other guard would point to the wrong door.\n\nBut in reality:\n\n- If I ask the truth-teller, he says the liar would point to the wrong door.\n\n- If I ask the liar, he lies and says the truth-teller would point to the wrong door.\n\nSo, in both cases, I'm getting told that the other guard would point to the wrong door.\n\nBut I need to find the door to the riches. So, if both guards, when asked this question, indicate the wrong door, then perhaps I should choose the opposite door of what they indicate.\n\nLet me test this:\n\n- Suppose the left door is the one to riches, and the right leads to death.\n\n- Truth-teller knows this, so if I ask the truth-teller about the liar's response, he'd say the liar would point to the left (wrongly, since left is correct).\n\n- But wait, no. The liar would point to the left, saying it's the one to riches, which would be a lie because it actually is the one to riches.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If the liar is asked directly, he'd point to the correct door but lie about it, saying it's the wrong one. But in response to \"which door leads to riches?\", he'd point to the correct one and say \"this is the door to death,\" for example.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to refine my question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should ask: \"Which door would the other guard say leads to riches?\"\n\nThen:\n\n- If I ask the truth-teller, he'd accurately say which door the liar would point to, which would be the wrong one.\n\n- If I ask the liar, he'd lie about which door the truth-teller would point to, so he'd say the wrong one.\n\nAgain, both would point to the wrong door.\n\nTherefore, if I take the opposite of their answer, I should get the correct door.\n\nBut I need to formulate a question that directly leads me to the correct door without needing to interpret.\n\nMaybe I should ask: \"Which door would you say leads to riches if you were telling the truth?\"\n\n- If I ask the truth-teller, he'd say the correct door, since he's telling the truth.\n\n- If I ask the liar, saying \"if you were telling the truth\" would require him to tell the truth, but since he lies, he'd actually have to tell the truth about what he would say if he were telling the truth, which might be confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: I should ask a question about what both guards would say.\n\nOr perhaps I can ask: \"If I were to ask you which door leads to riches, what would you say?\"\n\n- Truth-teller would say the correct door.\n\n- Liar would say the wrong door.\n\nBut then I don't know who's who.\n\nWait, maybe: \"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to riches, what would he say?\"\n\n- Truth-teller would accurately report that the liar would point to the wrong door.\n\n- Liar would lie about what the truth-teller would say, so he'd say the wrong door.\n\nSo, again, both would point to the wrong door.\n\nTherefore, I should choose the opposite door of whichever one they indicate.\n\nBut I need to formulate a question that directly gives me the correct door.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ask: \"Which door does not lead to certain death?\"\n\n- Truth-teller would point to the riches door.\n\n- Liar would point to the death door, lying about which one does not lead to certain death.\n\nBut then I don't know who's who.\n\nWait, perhaps: \"Which door would you recommend to reach the riches?\"\n\n- Truth-teller would recommend the correct door.\n\n- Liar would recommend the wrong door.\n\nAgain, same problem.\n\nMaybe I need to ask: \"Is this door the one to riches?\" while pointing to one door.\n\nBut then I don't know who's who, and I might get a true or false answer.\n\nThis seems too risky.\n\nWait, perhaps I should ask: \"Do you consider the left door to lead to riches?\"\n\n- Truth-teller would say yes if it's correct, no if it's not.\n\n- Liar would say no if it's correct, yes if it's not.\n\nBut this still doesn't help me directly.\n\nMaybe I need to ask a question that involves both guards' opinions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ask: \"If I were to ask you which door leads to riches, would you point to this door?\" while pointing to one door.\n\nThen:\n\n- If I ask the truth-teller about the correct door, he'd say yes.\n\n- If I ask the truth-teller about the wrong door, he'd say no.\n\n- If I ask the liar about the correct door, he'd say no (lying about pointing to it).\n\n- If I ask the liar about the wrong door, he'd say yes (lying about not pointing to it).\n\nSo, if I ask about the correct door, both would say yes.\n\nWait, no:\n\n- Truth-teller, asked about correct door: \"Would you point to this door?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n- Liar, asked about correct door: \"Would you point to this door?\" \"No,\" because he would actually point to it but lie about it.\n\nWait, no. The liar, when asked \"would you point to this door?\", if it's the correct one, he would say \"no,\" because he would actually point to it but lie about it.\n\nSimilarly, if it's the wrong door, he would say \"yes,\" lying about not pointing to it.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps I need to step back.\n\nI recall that in such puzzles, asking about what the other guard would say is a common strategy.\n\nSo, let's try: \"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to riches, what would he say?\"\n\nThen:\n\n- Truth-teller tells me what the liar would say, which is the wrong door.\n\n- Liar lies about what the truth-teller would say, so he also points to the wrong door.\n\nTherefore, both point to the wrong door.\n\nSo, if I take the opposite of their answer, I get the correct door.\n\nTherefore, I can ask one guard this question, get the indication of the wrong door, and choose the other door.\n\nThis seems like a solid strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ask: \"Which door would both of you agree on?\"\n\n- The truth-teller would point to the door that the liar would falsely identify as correct, which is the wrong door.\n\n- The liar would point to the door that the truth-teller would identify as correct, which is the correct door, but the liar is lying, so he's actually pointing to the wrong door.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf I ask for the door both would agree on:\n\n- Truth-teller knows the liar would point to the wrong door, and the truth-teller would point to the correct door, so there's no agreement. Maybe this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps: \"Which door would you both agree is the one to riches?\"\n\n- Truth-teller would point to the correct door.\n\n- Liar would point to the wrong door, lying about the agreement.\n\nThis doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: \"If I were to ask you and the other guard which door leads to riches, would you point to the same door?\"\n\nThen:\n\n- Truth-teller would say no, because the liar would point to the wrong door.\n\n- Liar would say yes, lying about agreeing with the truth-teller.\n\nThis complicates things further.\n\nI think sticking with the initial strategy is best: ask one guard about what the other would say, and then choose the opposite door.\n\nSo, the question to ask is: \"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to riches, which door would he point to?\"\n\nWhichever door that guard indicates, I should choose the opposite door.\n\nThis way, whether I'm asking the truth-teller or the liar, I get directed to the wrong door, and by choosing the opposite, I ensure I get to the riches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Ask either guard: \"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to the riches, which door would he point to?\" Then choose the opposite door of the one indicated.}} \\]"
