        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B each day. Each unit of product A takes 4 hours to produce, and each unit of product B takes 6 hours. I need to find out the total working hours required daily to produce both products.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total hours needed for product A. Since each unit takes 4 hours and they produce 500 units, I can multiply 4 hours by 500 units. That should give me the total hours for product A.\n\nSimilarly, for product B, each unit takes 6 hours, and they produce 300 units, so I'll multiply 6 hours by 300 units to get the total hours for product B.\n\nThen, I'll add the total hours for product A and product B together to get the overall total working hours needed daily.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\nFor product A: 4 hours/unit * 500 units = 2000 hours\n\nFor product B: 6 hours/unit * 300 units = 1800 hours\n\nTotal working hours: 2000 hours + 1800 hours = 3800 hours\n\nSo, the factory needs 3800 working hours daily to produce both products.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot. Is there a way to double-check this?\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total production in terms of hours per day.\n\nProduct A: 500 units * 4 hours/unit = 2000 hours\n\nProduct B: 300 units * 6 hours/unit = 1800 hours\n\nAdding them up gives 3800 hours, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the hourly production rate for each product.\n\nFor product A, if one unit takes 4 hours, then in one hour, they can produce 1/4 unit.\n\nSimilarly, for product B, one unit takes 6 hours, so in one hour, they can produce 1/6 unit.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary for this particular problem.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate how many hours are needed for the entire production run of both products.\n\nSo, 500 units of A * 4 hours/unit + 300 units of B * 6 hours/unit = 2000 + 1800 = 3800 hours.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think 3800 hours is the correct total working hours needed daily to produce both products.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3800} \\]"
