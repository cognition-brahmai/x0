        "content": "So I've got this problem here about marbles in a jar. It says that the jar contains only red, green, and blue marbles, and the ratio of red to green to blue marbles is 3:4:7. It also tells me that there are 56 blue marbles, and I need to find out the total number of marbles in the jar. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio like 3:4:7 tells me that for every 3 red marbles, there are 4 green marbles and 7 blue marbles. It's a way of comparing the quantities of these marbles relative to each other.\n\nNow, I know that there are 56 blue marbles. In the ratio, blue is represented by 7. So, I can think of the number 7 as corresponding to 56 actual marbles. That means each \"part\" of the ratio must represent a certain number of marbles. To find out how many marbles each part represents, I can divide the number of blue marbles by the blue ratio number.\n\nSo, if 7 parts are equal to 56 marbles, then one part is equal to 56 divided by 7. Let me calculate that:\n\n56 \u00f7 7 = 8\n\nOkay, so each part of the ratio represents 8 marbles.\n\nNow, I can find out how many marbles there are of each color by multiplying their ratio numbers by this value.\n\nFor red marbles:\n\n3 parts \u00d7 8 marbles per part = 24 marbles\n\nFor green marbles:\n\n4 parts \u00d7 8 marbles per part = 32 marbles\n\nFor blue marbles:\n\n7 parts \u00d7 8 marbles per part = 56 marbles (which matches the given information)\n\nTo find the total number of marbles, I can add these together:\n\n24 (red) + 32 (green) + 56 (blue) = 112 marbles\n\nAlternatively, since I know that each part represents 8 marbles, and the total ratio parts are 3 + 4 + 7 = 14 parts, I can multiply 14 parts by 8 marbles per part to get the total number of marbles:\n\n14 \u00d7 8 = 112 marbles\n\nEither way, I get the same answer, which is a good check that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, the total number of marbles in the jar is 112.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]"
