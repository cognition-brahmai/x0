        "content": "So the baker uses 4 cups of flour to make 12 cookies, and I need to find out how many cups he'll need for 36 cookies. Hmm, this seems like a proportion problem. Let me think about it.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much flour is needed for one cookie. If 4 cups make 12 cookies, then for one cookie, it would be 4 cups divided by 12 cookies. That is, 4/12 cups per cookie. Simplifying that, it's 1/3 cup per cookie.\n\nNow, if one cookie requires 1/3 cup of flour, then 36 cookies would require 36 times 1/3 cup. So, 36 * (1/3) = 12 cups.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at it? Maybe using ratios.\n\nLet's set up a ratio. The original ratio is 4 cups for 12 cookies, which can be written as 4/12. For 36 cookies, I can set up a proportion: 4/12 = x/36, where x is the number of cups needed for 36 cookies.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 4 * 36 = 12 * x, which gives 144 = 12x. Then, dividing both sides by 12, x = 12 cups.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many times larger 36 is compared to 12. Since 36 divided by 12 is 3, it means we need 3 times the amount of flour. So, 4 cups * 3 = 12 cups.\n\nAlright, all methods point to 12 cups of flour needed for 36 cookies.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if the initial assumption holds. If 4 cups make 12 cookies, then 12 cups should make three times as many, which is 36 cookies. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've covered it from different angles and the answer remains the same. The baker will need 12 cups of flour to make 36 cookies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
