        "content": "So the teacher is giving 5 stickers to each student, and there are 25 students in the class. I need to find out how many stickers the teacher gives out in total.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. The teacher is giving the same number of stickers to each student, which is 5 stickers per student. There are 25 students, so I need to find the total number of stickers given to all the students combined.\n\nTo find the total, I think I need to multiply the number of stickers per student by the number of students. So, it's 5 stickers times 25 students.\n\nLet me write that down: 5 stickers/student \u00d7 25 students.\n\nNow, when I multiply these, the \"students\" unit will cancel out, leaving me with just the number of stickers.\n\nSo, 5 \u00d7 25.\n\nI know that 5 times 20 is 100, and 5 times 5 is 25. So, 100 plus 25 is 125.\n\nTherefore, the teacher gives out 125 stickers in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as adding 5 stickers for each of the 25 students.\n\nSo, 5 + 5 + 5 + ... and so on, 25 times.\n\nBut that seems time-consuming. Multiplication is faster.\n\nOr, I could break it down further.\n\nI know that 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 15 is 75. So, 50 plus 75 is 125.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 25 as 20 plus 5, and then multiply each by 5.\n\nSo, 5 times 20 is 100, and 5 times 5 is 25. Adding those gives 125.\n\nAnother way: I could think of 25 as 100 divided by 4.\n\nSo, 5 times 25 is the same as 5 times 100 divided by 4.\n\nThat's 500 divided by 4, which is 125.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer, which is 125 stickers.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\nSo, the teacher gives out 125 stickers in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
