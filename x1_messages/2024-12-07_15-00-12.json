        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with 25 cars, renting them out at an average of $45 per day. We need to find out how much revenue they generate in a month with an average occupancy rate of 80%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what occupancy rate means. Occupancy rate is the percentage of time that the cars are rented out. So, if it's 80%, that means that on average, 80% of the cars are rented out each day.\n\nLet me calculate how many cars are rented out on average per day. If there are 25 cars and 80% are rented out, then:\n\nAverage number of cars rented per day = 25 cars * 80% = 25 * 0.8 = 20 cars\n\nSo, on average, 20 cars are rented out each day.\n\nNext, each car rents out for $45 per day. Therefore, the daily revenue would be:\n\nDaily revenue = 20 cars * $45/car = $900\n\nNow, to find the monthly revenue, I need to know how many days are in the month. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume an average month has 30 days.\n\nMonthly revenue = Daily revenue * number of days in the month = $900/day * 30 days = $27,000\n\nWait a minute, but some months have 31 days, and February has 28 or 29 days. Maybe I should consider a more accurate average. The average month has about 30.44 days (365 days / 12 months). But for simplicity, 30 days is often used in such calculations unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, based on a 30-day month, the revenue would be $27,000.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe considering the total possible revenue if all cars were rented out 100% of the time.\n\nTotal possible revenue per day if all 25 cars are rented out: 25 cars * $45/car = $1,125\n\nThen, with an 80% occupancy rate, actual daily revenue: $1,125 * 80% = $1,125 * 0.8 = $900\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, for the month:\n\n$900/day * 30 days = $27,000\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the monthly occupancy rate, but since it's given as an average daily occupancy, the above approach should be fine.\n\nI think $27,000 is the correct answer, assuming a 30-day month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27000} \\]"
