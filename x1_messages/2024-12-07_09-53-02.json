        "content": "The Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the American Civil War, which was fought from 1861 to 1865. This battle, which took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863, is often referred to as the war's turning point because it marked the Union's significant victory over the Confederacy, halting General Robert E. Lee's second invasion of the North. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides but ultimately led to increased support for President Abraham Lincoln and his administration's war efforts. The significance of this battle is also remembered through Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, delivered on November 19, 1863, during the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania."
