It covers an area of about 3.6 million square miles, making it the largest hot desert in the world. However, if we consider cold deserts as well, the largest desert is actually the Antarctic Desert, covering around 5.5 million square miles. But based on your description, it seems you're referring to the Sahara in Africa."
