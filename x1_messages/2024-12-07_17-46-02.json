        "content": "So there are 6 cats in the room, and each of these cats has 3 kittens. We need to figure out how many legs are in the room in total.\n\nFirst, let's think about the adult cats. Cats have 4 legs each, right? So, if there are 6 adult cats, then the total number of legs for the adult cats would be 6 cats times 4 legs per cat, which is 24 legs.\n\nNow, each of these 6 cats has 3 kittens. So, the total number of kittens would be 6 cats times 3 kittens per cat, which is 18 kittens.\n\nKittens are also cats, so they also have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs for the kittens would be 18 kittens times 4 legs per kitten, which is 72 legs.\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs in the room, we add the legs of the adult cats and the legs of the kittens together. That's 24 legs from the adults plus 72 legs from the kittens, which equals 96 legs.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? Let's double-check. We have 6 adult cats and 18 kittens, all with 4 legs each. So, total legs should indeed be (6 + 18) times 4, which is 24 times 4, equaling 96 legs.\n\nBut, is there anything else in the room that has legs? For example, is there furniture in the room, like chairs or tables, that might have legs? The question says \"in the room,\" but it doesn't mention any other objects besides the cats and their kittens.\n\nIf we consider only the cats and kittens, then the total number of legs is 96. However, if there is other furniture in the room, we might need to include their legs as well. But since the question doesn't specify anything else, perhaps it's safe to assume that only the cats and their kittens are in the room.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the room has a certain number of legs because it's a physical structure, but typically rooms don't have legs; they are part of the building's structure.\n\nSo, sticking to the information given, it's just the cats and their kittens in the room, totaling 96 legs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]\n"
