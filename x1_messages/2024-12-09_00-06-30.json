        "content": "Patrick Henry is the person who first said, \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" This famous quote was delivered during a speech he gave at the Virginia Convention on March 23, 1775, in St. John's Church in Richmond, Virginia. In this speech, Henry passionately argued in favor of military preparation against the British, urging his fellow Virginians to take action in the face of what he saw as an impending conflict. His words were a powerful call to arms and have since become synonymous with the American spirit of independence and resistance to tyranny."
