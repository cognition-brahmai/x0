        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 5 children in the family, and each one has at least one brother and one sister. I need to find out the minimum number of boys and girls in the family.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. The problem is saying that every child in the family has at least one brother and one sister. So, no child should be alone in their gender; there must be at least one other of the same gender and at least one of the opposite gender.\n\nLet me think about the possible distributions of boys and girls in the family.\n\nSuppose there are B boys and G girls, and B + G = 5.\n\nEach boy has B-1 brothers and G sisters.\n\nEach girl has G-1 sisters and B brothers.\n\nThe condition is that for every child, number of brothers >=1 and number of sisters >=1.\n\nSo, for boys: B-1 >=1 and G >=1.\n\nSimilarly, for girls: G-1 >=1 and B >=1.\n\nWait, but these conditions need to hold for all children, so both B-1 >=1 and G-1 >=1 must be true.\n\nBecause if B-1 <1 for some boys, meaning they have no brothers, which violates the condition that each child has at least one brother.\n\nSimilarly for girls.\n\nSo, B-1 >=1 implies B >=2.\n\nAnd G-1 >=1 implies G >=2.\n\nAlso, since B + G =5, and B >=2 and G >=2, the possible pairs are:\n\nB=2, G=3\n\nB=3, G=2\n\nB=4, G=1 but G >=2 required, so invalid\n\nB=1, G=4 but B >=2 required, so invalid\n\nB=2, G=3 and B=3, G=2 are the only possibilities.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the minimum number of boys and girls.\n\nWhat does \"minimum\" refer to here? Does it mean the minimum number of boys and girls individually, or the minimum sum, but sum is fixed at 5.\n\nWait, maybe it's asking for the minimum number of boys and girls in terms of the smaller of the two numbers.\n\nIn B=2, G=3, the minimum of boys and girls is 2.\n\nIn B=3, G=2, the minimum is again 2.\n\nSo, the minimum number of boys and girls in the family is 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the minimal possible number for each gender separately.\n\nBut given the condition, as we saw, both B and G must be at least 2.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are at least 2 boys and at least 2 girls in the family.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimum number of boys and girls.\n\nMaybe it's asking for the smallest possible number for one gender.\n\nIn B=2, G=3, the minimum is 2.\n\nIn B=3, G=2, the minimum is 2.\n\nSo, the minimum number is 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the minimal configuration where neither gender is less than 2.\n\nSo, the family must have at least 2 boys and at least 2 girls.\n\nHence, the minimum number of boys is 2, and the minimum number of girls is 2.\n\nBut since B + G =5, and B >=2, G >=2, then B can be 2 or 3, and G accordingly 3 or 2.\n\nSo, in any case, the minimum number of boys is 2, and the minimum number of girls is 2.\n\nI think the answer is that there are at least 2 boys and 2 girls in the family.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
