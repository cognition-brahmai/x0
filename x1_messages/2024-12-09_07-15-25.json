        "content": "So there are 120 students in total in the school. And it's given that 60% of them are boys. I need to find out how many girls there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many boys there are, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to get the number of girls.\n\nSo, 60% of 120 students are boys. To find 60% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.60.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 120 times 0.60.\n\n120 times 0.60 is 72. So there are 72 boys in the school.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, I subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: 120 minus 72.\n\n120 minus 72 is 48.\n\nTherefore, there are 48 girls in the school.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of girls and then find that percentage of the total number of students.\n\nIf 60% are boys, then the remaining percentage must be girls. So, 100% minus 60% equals 40%. Therefore, 40% of the students are girls.\n\nNow, to find 40% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.40.\n\n120 times 0.40 is 48.\n\nAgain, I get 48 girls in the school.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 48 is the correct number of girls in the school.\n\nIs there any other way to verify this? Maybe I can set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s say, let G be the number of girls in the school.\n\nThen, the total number of students is boys plus girls, which is 72 plus G, and that equals 120.\n\nSo, 72 + G = 120.\n\nTo find G, I can subtract 72 from both sides of the equation: G = 120 - 72, which is 48.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the percentage directly, G is 40% of 120, which is 48.\n\nAlright, I think I\u2019ve confirmed it enough. There are 48 girls in the school.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
