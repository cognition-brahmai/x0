The question seems straightforward, but maybe there's a trick to it. The options are the stove, the heater, or the candle. I need to decide which one to light first with my single match.\n\nFirst, consider the candle. It's the smallest and probably the easiest to light. Candles are designed to be lit with a single match, and it's a common practice. So, lighting the candle first might be the most straightforward choice.\n\nNext, the stove. If it's a gas stove, lighting it might require a slightly different procedure. Some stoves have electronic igniters, but if it's an older model, you might need to light it with a match. However, stoves can be a bit finicky to light, and you might need more than one match if you fail the first time.\n\nThen there's the heater. Depending on the type of heater, it might not even be designed to be lit with a match. If it's an electric heater, it doesn't need to be lit at all. If it's a wood stove or a fireplace heater, you might need to light kindling or newspapers to get it started, which could require more than one match.\n\nGiven that I only have one match, I need to choose wisely. If I light the candle first, I have a source of continuous light or fire that I can use to light the other items if needed. For example, if the stove is difficult to light with just one match, I could use the candle to light a piece of paper and then use that to light the stove.\n\nSimilarly, if I need to light the heater and it's a wood stove, I could use the candle to light the kindling.\n\nSo, in terms of utility, lighting the candle first seems like the most practical choice. It provides a ongoing flame that I can use to light other things without needing additional matches.\n\nAnother way to look at it is from a safety perspective. Lighting the candle first minimizes the risk of trying to light larger appliances with a single match, which could be hazardous if not done correctly.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"light first\" might be interpreted in a playfully tricky way. Some people might say you should light the match first, but technically, you already have a lit match to light the other items.\n\nBut in the context of the question, assuming the match is already lit, you're choosing what to light first among the three options.\n\nSo, to summarize, lighting the candle first seems to be the best choice because it provides a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u706b\u7130 that can be used to light the other items if necessary, and it's the safest and most straightforward option with a single match.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{the candle}} \\]"
