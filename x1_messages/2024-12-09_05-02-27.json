        "content": "No, it's a myth that female praying mantises always eat their male partners during mating. While it's true that in some species of praying mantis, the female may consume the male during or after mating, this behavior is not universal across all species. In fact, in many species, cannibalism is rare or non-existent. The misconception likely arises from observations in captivity, where stress and lack of food can lead to increased instances of cannibalism. In natural settings, this behavior is much less common."
