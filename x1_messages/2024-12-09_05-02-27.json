        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains leaving from different stations at the same time, heading towards each other. Station A and Station B are 320 kilometers apart. The first train from Station A is going at 80 km/h, and the second train from Station B is going at 100 km/h. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nOkay, so since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. That means the relative speed is 80 km/h plus 100 km/h, which is 180 km/h. That makes sense because they're coming from opposite directions.\n\nNow, the distance between them is 320 kilometers. If they're approaching each other at a combined speed of 180 km/h, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their relative speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed. That would be 320 km divided by 180 km/h.\n\nLet me do the math: 320 divided by 180. Hmm, that's the same as 320/180, which simplifies to 32/18, and further to 16/9. So, 16/9 hours. But that's a fraction, and it might be better to express it in hours and minutes.\n\n16/9 hours is 1 hour plus 7/9 of an hour. To convert 7/9 of an hour into minutes, I can multiply 7/9 by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. 7/9 * 60 is, let's see, 7 * 60 is 420, divided by 9. 420 divided by 9 is 46.666..., which is approximately 46 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nSo, they will meet approximately 1 hour and 46 minutes after they both leave their respective stations.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to think about the distance each train covers over time until they meet. Let\u2019s say they meet after t hours. In that time, the first train would have traveled 80t kilometers, and the second train would have traveled 100t kilometers. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the initial distance between them, which is 320 kilometers.\n\nSo, 80t + 100t = 320.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 180t = 320.\n\nThen, t = 320 / 180, which is the same as 16/9 hours, just like before.\n\nSo, that confirms that my first approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the time it takes for each train to cover the distance at their respective speeds, but that seems more complicated and unnecessary in this case.\n\nI think 16/9 hours is the correct answer, which is approximately 1 hour and 46 minutes.\n\nSo, the two trains will meet approximately 1 hour and 46 minutes after they start.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{16}{9} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
