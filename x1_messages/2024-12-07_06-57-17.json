        "content": "Let's see. So, if a bacteria population doubles every 20 minutes, and we want to know how many times it will double in 5 hours, we need to figure out how many 20-minute intervals there are in 5 hours.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert 5 hours into minutes to make it easier to work with. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 5 hours would be:\n\n5 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes\n\nNow, if the bacteria double every 20 minutes, then the number of times it doubles in 300 minutes would be:\n\n300 minutes \u00f7 20 minutes/doubling = 15 doublings\n\nSo, the bacteria population will double 15 times in 5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If it doubles every 20 minutes, then after 20 minutes it doubles once, after 40 minutes it doubles twice, and so on. So, in 300 minutes, dividing by 20 does indeed give us 15. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should think about it another way. Let's see, the formula for exponential growth is:\n\nN = N\u2080 \u00d7 2^(t/T)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the final population size\n\n- N\u2080 is the initial population size\n\n- t is the time elapsed\n\n- T is the doubling time\n\nIn this case, t is 5 hours (300 minutes), and T is 20 minutes. So, the exponent would be 300/20 = 15. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the population doubles 15 times in 5 hours.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should consider whether the starting time counts as a doubling. Like, at time zero, the population is N\u2080, and then after 20 minutes it doubles to 2N\u2080, and so on. So, in 300 minutes, it would have doubled 15 times, starting from time zero.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think that at time zero, it's the initial population, and the first doubling happens after 20 minutes. But in terms of the number of doublings in a given time period, the calculation should still hold.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. If the population doubles every 20 minutes, then the number of doublings is directly proportional to the elapsed time divided by the doubling time. So, 300 minutes divided by 20 minutes per doubling gives 15 doublings.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of exponential growth factors. Each doubling multiplies the population by 2, so after n doublings, the population is multiplied by 2^n.\n\nSo, if n = 15, then the population is multiplied by 2^15, which is 32,768 times the initial population.\n\nBut the question is only asking for how many times it doubles, not the final population size. So, 15 is the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of partial doublings. Like, if the time wasn't a perfect multiple of the doubling time, then perhaps there would be a partial doubling. But in this case, 300 minutes is exactly 15 times 20 minutes, so no partial doubling occurs.\n\nAlternatively, if the time was, say, 301 minutes, then it would be 15 full doublings plus a little extra time. But since it's exactly 300 minutes, no partial doubling is needed.\n\nSo, I think 15 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think about a smaller time frame. For example, in 40 minutes, the population should double twice. At 20 minutes, it doubles once, and at 40 minutes, it doubles again. So, in 40 minutes, that's two doublings. Similarly, in 60 minutes, it would double three times, and so on.\n\nSo, scaling up to 300 minutes, it should double 15 times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and the doubling time is 20 minutes, then in one hour, there are 60/20 = 3 doublings.\n\nTherefore, in 5 hours, the number of doublings would be 5 hours \u00d7 3 doublings/hour = 15 doublings.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 15 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to cover all bases, perhaps I should consider the concept of exponential growth rate. The growth rate k can be found using the formula:\n\nk = ln(2) / T\n\nWhere T is the doubling time.\n\nSo, k = ln(2) / 20 minutes\n\nThen, the population at time t is:\n\nN = N\u2080 \u00d7 e^(k\u00d7t)\n\nBut since we know that it doubles every 20 minutes, using the doubling time directly is simpler, and we've already determined that the number of doublings is 15.\n\nAlternatively, if we plug in t = 300 minutes, then:\n\nN = N\u2080 \u00d7 e^( (ln(2)/20) \u00d7 300 ) = N\u2080 \u00d7 e^( (ln(2) \u00d7 15) ) = N\u2080 \u00d7 (e^(ln(2)))^15 = N\u2080 \u00d7 2^15\n\nAgain, this confirms that the population doubles 15 times.\n\nI think I've approached this from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the bacteria population will double 15 times in 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
