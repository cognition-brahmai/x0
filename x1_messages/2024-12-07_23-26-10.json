        "content": "I'm trying to decipher this riddle you've presented. It seems to be describing something that continuously grows and decreases, melts when exposed to fire, provides light in darkness, and ultimately turns into a shapeless mass. Let's break it down piece by piece.\n\nFirst, \"always wax, yet always wane.\" Wax means to grow or increase, while wane means to decrease or diminish. So, whatever this object is, it's constantly going through cycles of growth and decline. Maybe it's something like the moon, which goes through phases of waxing and waning, but the moon doesn't melt when exposed to fire. Or perhaps it's a type of material that expands and contracts.\n\nNext, \"I melt, succumbed to the flame.\" This suggests that the object is combustible or at least melts when heated. So, it must be a material with a low melting point, like wax or certain metals.\n\nThen, \"lighting darkness, with fate unblest.\" This indicates that the object is used to provide light in dark places, possibly a candle or a lamp. The \"fate unblest\" part might suggest that its existence or function is fleeting or doomed in some way.\n\nFinally, \"I soon devolve to shapeless mess.\" This reinforces the idea that the object loses its form when heated or burned, turning into a shapeless mass.\n\nPutting all these clues together, it sounds like the answer is a candle. Candles are made of wax, which melts when exposed to heat or flame. They provide light in darkness, but their fate is to be consumed by the flame, eventually turning into a pool of liquid wax.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be other possibilities. For example, maybe it's a piece of ice. Ice can wax and wane in size depending on temperature conditions, melts when exposed to heat, can be used to cool darkness (though that's a stretch), and turns into water, which is shapeless. However, ice doesn't typically provide light unless it's, say, illuminated from within, which doesn't quite fit the riddle.\n\nAnother possibility could be a metal that melts easily, like tin or lead. These metals have relatively low melting points and could melt when exposed to flame. However, metals don't usually provide light unless heated to high temperatures where they glow, which might not align with \"lighting darkness.\" Additionally, melted metal still has a form, albeit shapeless, but it's still a liquid with a distinct substance, unlike the \"shapeless mess\" suggested in the riddle.\n\nComparatively, a candle fits best because it's made of wax, which melts when burned, provides light, and ultimately turns into a shapeless pool of liquid wax. So, I think the answer to the riddle is a candle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{candle}} \\]"
