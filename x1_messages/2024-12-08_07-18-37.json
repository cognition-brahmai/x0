To celebrate his 100th birthday, there would likely be a series of global events, special editions of merchandise, and possibly a new film or television special. Disney parks around the world might have special parades, fireworks, and themed attractions. Additionally, there could be collaborations with other brands, limited edition products, and possibly a documentary or retrospective on Mickey's impact on popular culture."
