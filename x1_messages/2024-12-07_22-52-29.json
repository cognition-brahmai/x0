        "content": "So, there's this train that goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours to do that. Now, we need to find out how long it would take for a car going at 45 miles per hour to cover the same distance. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the distance between Town A and Town B is. Since the train goes at 60 miles per hour and takes 2 hours, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, distance from Town A to Town B is 60 miles per hour \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, we have a car traveling at 45 miles per hour covering the same 120-mile distance. I need to find out how long that would take. Again, using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\n\nSo, time for the car is 120 miles \u00f7 45 miles per hour. Let's do that calculation.\n\n120 divided by 45. Well, 45 goes into 120 two times because 45 \u00d7 2 = 90. Then, 120 minus 90 is 30. So, there's a remainder of 30. Now, 45 goes into 30 how many times? It goes in 0.666... times, which is 2 and 2/3 hours.\n\nBut, to make it clearer, maybe I can convert that into hours and minutes. 2/3 of an hour is 40 minutes because 60 minutes \u00d7 2/3 = 40 minutes.\n\nSo, the car would take 2 hours and 40 minutes to cover the same distance.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the proportion method. The train goes at 60 mph and takes 2 hours, so the car goes at 45 mph. Since speed and time are inversely proportional for a given distance, higher speed means less time.\n\nSo, if Speed1 \u00d7 Time1 = Speed2 \u00d7 Time2, then Time2 = (Speed1 \u00d7 Time1) \u00f7 Speed2\n\nPlugging in the values: Time2 = (60 mph \u00d7 2 hours) \u00f7 45 mph = 120 \u00f7 45 = 2.666... hours, which is again 2 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, the car would take 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from Town A to Town B at 45 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours and } 40 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
