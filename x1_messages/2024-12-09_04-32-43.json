        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of pens: Type A costs $3 each and Type B costs $5 each. The customer bought a total of 20 pens for $80, and we need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A pens.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B pens.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of pens is 20.\n\n2. The total cost of the pens is $80.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)  (because the total number of pens is 20)\n\n2. \\( 3x + 5y = 80 \\)  (because Type A pens cost $3 each and Type B pens cost $5 each, and the total cost is $80)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think substitution might be straightforward here.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 3(20 - y) + 5y = 80 \\)\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 60 - 3y + 5y = 80 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 60 + 2y = 80 \\)\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n\\( 2y = 20 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nNow that we have \\( y = 10 \\), we can substitute back into the equation \\( x = 20 - y \\) to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - 10 = 10 \\)\n\nSo, the customer bought 10 Type A pens and 10 Type B pens.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they bought 10 Type A pens at $3 each, that's \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) dollars. Plus 10 Type B pens at $5 each, that's \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\) dollars. Total cost is \\( 30 + 50 = 80 \\) dollars, which matches the given total. Also, 10 + 10 = 20 pens, which matches the total number of pens. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using ratios or thinking about the cost difference between the two types of pens.\n\nLet's think about the cost difference. If all 20 pens were Type A, the total cost would be \\( 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\) dollars. But the customer actually spent $80, which is $20 more than $60. Each Type B pen costs $2 more than Type A pens (since $5 - $3 = $2). So, the extra $20 must come from the Type B pens.\n\nIf each Type B pen adds an extra $2 to the total cost, then the number of Type B pens is \\( 20 \\div 2 = 10 \\). So, \\( y = 10 \\), and consequently, \\( x = 10 \\), which matches our previous result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the average cost per pen. The total cost is $80 for 20 pens, so the average cost per pen is \\( 80 \\div 20 = 4 \\) dollars. Since Type A pens cost $3 and Type B pens cost $5, the average cost of $4 suggests an equal mix of both types, which again leads us to 10 of each type.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: the customer bought 10 Type A pens and 10 Type B pens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ Type A pens and } 10 \\text{ Type B pens}} \\]"
