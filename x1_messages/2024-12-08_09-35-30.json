First, we have five cats catching five mice in five minutes. So, it seems like the cats are working together to catch the mice. But, we need to find out how long it would take for one cat to catch one mouse.\n\nMaybe we can start by figuring out the rate at which the cats are catching mice. If five cats catch five mice in five minutes, then the total number of mice caught is five, and the total time is five minutes.\n\nLet's think about the rate per cat. If five cats catch five mice in five minutes, then each cat is catching one mouse in five minutes. Wait, is that right?\n\nActually, if five cats catch five mice in five minutes, that means that collectively, they catch one mouse per minute, because five mice in five minutes is one mouse per minute.\n\nBut, if there are five cats working together, we might assume they are each catching mice at the same rate. So, if collectively they catch one mouse per minute, then each cat is catching one-fifth of a mouse per minute.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let's try another approach.\n\nSuppose that each cat catches mice independently of the others. So, if five cats are catching mice, and they catch five mice in five minutes, then each cat is catching one mouse in five minutes.\n\nBut, if each cat is catching one mouse in five minutes, then if we have only one cat, it would take that one cat five minutes to catch one mouse.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's something else going on here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any dependency between the cats catching mice. For example, maybe the mice are being caught simultaneously, or maybe there's some overlap in their hunting.\n\nBut, if five cats catch five mice in five minutes, and we assume that each cat catches one mouse, and they do it independently, then yes, each cat takes five minutes to catch one mouse.\n\nTherefore, one cat would take five minutes to catch one mouse.\n\nBut, let me double-check this. Maybe there's a different way to look at it.\n\nSuppose we look at the rate of catching mice per cat per minute. If five cats catch five mice in five minutes, then the total cat-minutes is five cats times five minutes, which is 25 cat-minutes.\n\nAnd they catch five mice in that time, so the rate is five mice per 25 cat-minutes, which simplifies to one mouse per five cat-minutes.\n\nSo, one cat would take five minutes to catch one mouse.\n\nAlright, that matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If five cats can catch five mice in five minutes, then scaling down, one cat should catch one mouse in the same amount of time, assuming all cats work at the same rate and there's no interference between them.\n\nSo, yes, it would take one cat five minutes to catch one mouse.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
