Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It helps in finding suitable sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nPageLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline separated links. The input is one or more links, and it generates plain text output containing the content of the pages.\nLinkPicker[input]: Picks links from plain text and gives a plain text, newline-separated response of links.\nNLPModel[input]: Natural Language Processing Model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input text passage. The input should be a text question that refers to a :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the weather like, given :evidence1:?\n\nEach function's input should simply be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to join a string with an evidence variable, e.g., NLPModel[What is the population of New York City, given :evidence3:?]\n\nOnly include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2021 and what is their most famous work?"
