        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a square with an area of 64 square inches, and I need to find the length of its diagonal. Okay, let's start by recalling some properties of squares. In a square, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals are also equal and bisect each other at right angles.\n\nFirst, I need to find the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = s^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( s \\) is the length of a side, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ s^2 = 64 \\]\n\nTo find \\( s \\), I'll take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{64} \\]\n\n\\[ s = 8 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nAlright, so each side of the square is 8 inches long.\n\nNow, to find the length of the diagonal. I remember that in a square, the diagonals can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, since the diagonal forms a right triangle with two sides of the square.\n\nSo, in a square, the diagonal \\( d \\) is related to the side \\( s \\) by:\n\n\\[ d = s\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nThis comes from the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ d^2 = s^2 + s^2 \\]\n\n\\[ d^2 = 2s^2 \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{2s^2} \\]\n\n\\[ d = s\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSo, plugging in the value of \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ d = 8\\sqrt{2} \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nBut maybe I should leave it in decimal form for clarity. Let's calculate \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), which is approximately 1.414.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ d \\approx 8 \\times 1.414 \\]\n\n\\[ d \\approx 11.312 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nWait a minute, but leaving it in terms of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is more precise and perhaps more acceptable in a mathematical context. So maybe I should keep it as \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) inches.\n\nLet me double-check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using trigonometry? In a square, the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, and each diagonal divides the square into two congruent isosceles right triangles.\n\nIn an isosceles right triangle, the hypotenuse is \\( s\\sqrt{2} \\), which matches what I have already.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the length of the diagonal of a rectangle, which is:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \\]\n\nBut since it's a square, \\( l = w = s \\), so again:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = \\sqrt{2s^2} = s\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSame result.\n\nIs there any other way to think about this? Perhaps using vectors or coordinates? Let's try that.\n\nIf I place the square on a coordinate plane with one corner at the origin (0,0), and sides along the x and y axes, then the coordinates of the corners would be (0,0), (8,0), (8,8), and (0,8).\n\nThe diagonal would stretch from (0,0) to (8,8). The distance between these two points can be found using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{64 + 64} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{128} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{64 \\times 2} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 8\\sqrt{2} \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if the area being 64 square inches could imply anything else. Wait, sometimes problems might involve squares inscribed in other shapes or have additional constraints, but in this case, it's a straightforward square with a given area.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if 8 inches is indeed the correct side length by verifying the area:\n\n\\[ s^2 = 8^2 = 64 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAnd then, confirming the diagonal:\n\n\\[ d = 8\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8 \\times 1.414 = 11.312 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and all methods lead to the same conclusion. So, the length of the diagonal is \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) inches, or approximately 11.312 inches.\n\nBut since the problem was given in terms of square inches and the side length is an integer, it's likely that the exact value in terms of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is preferred.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\sqrt{2} \\text{ inches}} \\]"
