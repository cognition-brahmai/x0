        "content": "So the library has 500 books in total. Out of these, 30% are fiction books, and the rest are non-fiction. I need to find out how many non-fiction books there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many fiction books there are. Since 30% of the books are fiction, I can calculate that by taking 30% of 500.\n\nTo calculate 30% of 500, I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of fiction books = (percentage / 100) * total number of books\n\nSo, number of fiction books = (30 / 100) * 500\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n30 divided by 100 is 0.3\n\nThen, 0.3 multiplied by 500 is 150\n\nSo, there are 150 fiction books.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-fiction books, I can subtract the number of fiction books from the total number of books.\n\nNumber of non-fiction books = total books - fiction books\n\nNumber of non-fiction books = 500 - 150 = 350\n\nTherefore, there are 350 non-fiction books in the library.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this? Maybe by finding the percentage of non-fiction books directly.\n\nIf 30% are fiction, then the remaining percentage must be non-fiction.\n\nSo, percentage of non-fiction books = 100% - 30% = 70%\n\nThen, number of non-fiction books = 70% of 500\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nNumber of non-fiction books = (70 / 100) * 500\n\n70 divided by 100 is 0.7\n\n0.7 multiplied by 500 is 350\n\nSo, again, 350 non-fiction books.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 350 is the correct number of non-fiction books in the library.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{350} \\]"
