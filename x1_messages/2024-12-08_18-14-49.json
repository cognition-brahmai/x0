        "content": "So I have this recursive sequence defined by T(n) = T(n-1) + n\u00b2, and it starts with T(1) = 1. I need to find out what T(4) is. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a recursive formula is. In this case, each term T(n) depends on the previous term T(n-1), with an addition of n\u00b2. So, to find T(4), I'll probably need to calculate T(2) and T(3) first, step by step.\n\nLet me start with T(1), which is given as 1.\n\nNow, to find T(2):\n\nT(2) = T(1) + 2\u00b2 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nNext, T(3):\n\nT(3) = T(2) + 3\u00b2 = 5 + 9 = 14.\n\nThen, T(4):\n\nT(4) = T(3) + 4\u00b2 = 14 + 16 = 30.\n\nSo, T(4) is 30.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to do this without calculating each step individually? Maybe there's a pattern or a closed-form formula that can directly give me T(n) without needing to compute all the preceding terms.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for T(n).\n\nGiven that T(n) = T(n-1) + n\u00b2, and T(1) = 1.\n\nThis looks like a summation. Starting from T(1), each T(n) adds n\u00b2 to the previous term.\n\nSo, T(n) = T(1) + \u03a3 from k=2 to n of k\u00b2.\n\nBut T(1) is 1, which is the same as 1\u00b2, so maybe it's better to write it as T(n) = \u03a3 from k=1 to n of k\u00b2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n\u03a3 k\u00b2 from k=1 to n = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nSo, T(n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I already calculated.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nT(1) = 1(1+1)(2*1+1)/6 = 1*2*3/6 = 6/6 = 1. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nT(2) = 2*3*5/6 = 30/6 = 5. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nT(3) = 3*4*7/6 = 84/6 = 14. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nT(4) = 4*5*9/6 = 180/6 = 30. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the general formula is T(n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nBut wait a second, this seems familiar. Isn't this the formula for the sum of squares?\n\nYes, it is. So, in essence, T(n) is the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers.\n\nThat makes sense given the recursive definition.\n\nSo, to directly answer the question, T(4) is 30.\n\nBut just to explore a bit more, let's see if there's another way to derive this formula.\n\nPerhaps using induction.\n\nBase case: n=1.\n\nT(1) = 1, and the formula gives 1(2)(3)/6 = 1, so it holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume it holds for n=k, i.e., T(k) = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6.\n\nWe need to show that T(k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)(2(k+1)+1)/6.\n\nFrom the recursive formula, T(k+1) = T(k) + (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting the assumed formula for T(k):\n\nT(k+1) = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6 + (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nLet's factor out (k+1):\n\nT(k+1) = (k+1) [k(2k+1)/6 + (k+1)].\n\nNow, let's simplify inside the brackets:\n\nk(2k+1)/6 + (k+1) = [2k\u00b2 + k + 6k + 6]/6 = [2k\u00b2 + 7k + 6]/6.\n\nNow, factor the numerator:\n\n2k\u00b2 + 7k + 6 = (2k + 3)(k + 2).\n\nSo, T(k+1) = (k+1)(2k+3)(k+2)/6.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (k+1)(k+2)(2(k+1)+1)/6.\n\nThis matches the formula for n=k+1.\n\nTherefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.\n\nSo, again, T(n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nThus, T(4) = 4*5*9/6 = 30.\n\nAlternatively, to build more intuition, let's think about what this sequence represents.\n\nEach term T(n) is the sum of squares up to n\u00b2.\n\nSo, T(1) = 1\u00b2 = 1.\n\nT(2) = 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nT(3) = 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.\n\nT(4) = 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the formula for the sum of squares, I could have derived it.\n\nOne way to derive the sum of squares formula is by using the method of differences.\n\nConsider that (k+1)^3 - k^3 = 3k\u00b2 + 3k + 1.\n\nIf I sum both sides from k=1 to n:\n\n\u03a3 (k+1)^3 - k^3 = \u03a3 (3k\u00b2 + 3k + 1).\n\nThe left side is a telescoping sum:\n\n(n+1)^3 - 1^3 = 3 \u03a3 k\u00b2 + 3 \u03a3 k + \u03a3 1.\n\nSo, (n+1)^3 - 1 = 3 \u03a3 k\u00b2 + 3 (n(n+1)/2) + n.\n\nNow, solve for \u03a3 k\u00b2:\n\n3 \u03a3 k\u00b2 = (n+1)^3 - 1 - 3n(n+1)/2 - n.\n\nLet's simplify the right side:\n\n(n+1)^3 - 1 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 - 1 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n.\n\nNow, subtract 3n(n+1)/2 + n:\n\nn^3 + 3n^2 + 3n - 3n(n+1)/2 - n.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn^3 + 3n^2 + 3n - (3n\u00b2 + 3n)/2 - n.\n\nLet's write all terms with a common denominator of 2:\n\n(2n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n - 3n\u00b2 - 3n - 2n)/2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n - 3n\u00b2 - 3n - 2n = 2n^3 + 3n\u00b2 + n.\n\nSo, 3 \u03a3 k\u00b2 = (2n^3 + 3n\u00b2 + n)/2.\n\nTherefore, \u03a3 k\u00b2 = (2n^3 + 3n\u00b2 + n)/6.\n\nFactor numerator:\n\nn(2n\u00b2 + 3n + 1)/6.\n\nFactor further:\n\nn(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nThere we go, that's the formula again.\n\nSo, T(n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nTherefore, T(4) = 4*5*9/6 = 30.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to verify this with a different approach, perhaps using binary coefficients or combinatorial identities.\n\nI know that \u03a3 k\u00b2 from k=1 to n can also be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients.\n\nSpecifically, k\u00b2 can be expressed as k(k-1) + k = k(k-1) + k.\n\nSo, \u03a3 k\u00b2 = \u03a3 [k(k-1) + k] = \u03a3 k(k-1) + \u03a3 k.\n\nNow, \u03a3 k = n(n+1)/2.\n\nAnd \u03a3 k(k-1) = \u03a3 k\u00b2 - \u03a3 k.\n\nWait, that doesn't help directly.\n\nAlternatively, I know that k\u00b2 = 2 * C(k,2) + C(k,1), where C(k,m) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nSo, \u03a3 k\u00b2 from k=1 to n = 2 * \u03a3 C(k,2) + \u03a3 C(k,1).\n\nUsing the hockey-stick identity, \u03a3 C(k,m) from k=m to n = C(n+1, m+1).\n\nTherefore, \u03a3 C(k,1) from k=1 to n = C(n+1,2).\n\nAnd \u03a3 C(k,2) from k=2 to n = C(n+1,3).\n\nSo, \u03a3 k\u00b2 = 2 * C(n+1,3) + C(n+1,2).\n\nLet's compute this:\n\nC(n+1,3) = (n+1)n(n-1)/6.\n\nC(n+1,2) = (n+1)n/2.\n\nTherefore, \u03a3 k\u00b2 = 2*(n+1)n(n-1)/6 + (n+1)n/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (n+1)n(n-1)/3 + (n+1)n/2.\n\nFactor out (n+1)n:\n\n= (n+1)n [ (n-1)/3 + 1/2 ].\n\nFind a common denominator for the terms in the brackets:\n\n= (n+1)n [ (2(n-1) + 3)/6 ] = (n+1)n [ (2n - 2 + 3)/6 ] = (n+1)n [ (2n +1)/6 ].\n\nTherefore, \u03a3 k\u00b2 = (n+1)n(2n+1)/6.\n\nAgain, the same formula.\n\nSo, T(n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nThus, T(4) = 4*5*9/6 = 30.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to think about this recursively, I can see how each term builds upon the previous one.\n\nStarting with T(1) = 1.\n\nThen, T(2) = T(1) + 2\u00b2 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nT(3) = T(2) + 3\u00b2 = 5 + 9 = 14.\n\nT(4) = T(3) + 4\u00b2 = 14 + 16 = 30.\n\nSame result.\n\nIt's good to see that all these different approaches lead to the same formula and the same value for T(4).\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let's compute T(4) directly using the formula.\n\nT(n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nT(4) = 4*5*9/6.\n\nFirst, 4*5 = 20.\n\n20*9 = 180.\n\n180/6 = 30.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's check T(3):\n\nT(3) = 3*4*7/6 = 84/6 = 14. Correct.\n\nAnd T(2) = 2*3*5/6 = 30/6 = 5. Correct.\n\nT(1) = 1*2*3/6 = 6/6 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula is verified for these small values.\n\nNow, just for curiosity, let's see what T(5) would be.\n\nT(5) = 5*6*11/6 = 330/6 = 55.\n\nAlternatively, calculating recursively:\n\nT(5) = T(4) + 5\u00b2 = 30 + 25 = 55. Same result.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered this topic thoroughly.\n\nTo summarize, the value of T(4) is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
