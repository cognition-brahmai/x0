        "content": "Let's see. So, the store sells apples in bags, and each bag contains 6 apples. There are 24 customers, and each one wants to buy 2 bags. I need to figure out how many apples the store should have in stock to meet this demand.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many bags in total the customers want to buy. Since each customer wants 2 bags, and there are 24 customers, I can multiply 24 by 2 to get the total number of bags needed.\n\nSo, 24 customers \u00d7 2 bags/customer = 48 bags.\n\nNow, each bag has 6 apples, so to find out the total number of apples needed, I should multiply the number of bags by the number of apples per bag.\n\nThat is, 48 bags \u00d7 6 apples/bag = 288 apples.\n\nTherefore, the store needs to have 288 apples in stock to satisfy all the customers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If each bag has 6 apples and each customer buys 2 bags, then per customer, they get 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 apples.\n\nAnd with 24 customers, the total apples needed would be 24 \u00d7 12 = 288 apples.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the store needs to have 288 apples in stock.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors. For example, are there any apples already in stock or any apples that might be reserved for other purposes? But based on the information given, I don't think there are any such considerations.\n\nAlso, the question seems straightforward: it's just about calculating the total number of apples needed based on the number of customers and the number of bags each wants to buy.\n\nSo, I think 288 apples is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
