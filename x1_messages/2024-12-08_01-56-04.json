        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total, and there are 10 more girls than boys. I need to find out how many boys there are.\n\nOkay, so let's denote the number of boys as b. Since there are 10 more girls than boys, the number of girls would be b + 10.\n\nNow, the total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is b + (b + 10) = 30.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 2b + 10 = 30.\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, I get 2b = 20.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, b = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 boys in the class.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. If there are 10 boys, then there are 10 + 10 = 20 girls.\n\nTotal students would be 10 boys + 20 girls = 30, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, the answer is 10 boys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
