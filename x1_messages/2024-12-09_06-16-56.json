Mornings are like, \"Hey Garfield, time to wake up!\" And I'm like, \"But I was having the best dream about a bottomless pit of lasagna.\" Ugh, who needs that? Just let me sleep in peace. But no, Jon always insists on dragging me out of bed at the crack of dawn. It's like he doesn't understand that my internal clock is set to cat time, not human time. Cat time is flexible; it says, \"Sleep in as long as you want, because who needs schedules anyway?\" But no, he's all, \"Garfield, come on, it's time for breakfast.\" And I'm thinking, \"Breakfast? At this unholy hour?\" It's madness, I tell you. Madness. So, to answer your question, I feel about mornings the way Jon feels about Mondays\u2014like they're the worst day of the week. But for me, every morning is like Monday. Joyful, isn't it?\n"
