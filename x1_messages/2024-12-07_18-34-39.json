        "content": "So I've got this problem about scheduling a sports league. There are 12 teams, and each team needs to play every other team twice\u2014once at home and once away. Also, each team can only play one game per week, and we need to figure out the total number of games and the minimum number of weeks required to finish the season.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many games are going to be played in total. Since there are 12 teams and each plays every other team twice, I should start by figuring out how many unique pairs of teams there are, and then multiply by two because they play each other twice.\n\nTo find the number of unique pairs, I can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 12 (teams), and k is 2 (since games are between two teams).\n\nSo, C(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nThat means there are 66 unique pairs of teams. Since each pair plays twice (home and away), the total number of games is 66 \u00d7 2 = 132 games.\n\nNow, I need to find out the minimum number of weeks required to complete these 132 games, given that each team can only play one game per week.\n\nEach week, each team plays one game. Since there are 12 teams, and each game involves two teams, the number of games per week is 12 / 2 = 6 games.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure about that. If there are 12 teams and each plays one game per week, then total games per week would be 12 games, but no, because each game is between two teams. So, actually, the number of games per week is equal to half the number of teams, because each game uses two teams.\n\nSo, games per week = 12 / 2 = 6 games.\n\nTherefore, the total number of weeks needed would be the total number of games divided by the number of games per week.\n\nTotal weeks = 132 games / 6 games per week = 22 weeks.\n\nWait, but I should double-check this. Each week, 6 games are played, involving all 12 teams (since each team plays once per week). So, over 22 weeks, 6 games per week would indeed be 132 games.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that this is the minimum number of weeks required. Is there any way to schedule more games per week without violating the constraint that each team can only play one game per week?\n\nWell, since each team can only play one game per week, and there are 12 teams, the maximum number of games per week is indeed 6, as each game uses two teams.\n\nTherefore, 22 weeks is the minimum number required to complete the season.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. In a round-robin tournament where each team plays every other team once, the number of weeks would be n - 1, where n is the number of teams, because each team plays n - 1 games, and in each week, each team plays once.\n\nBut in this case, each team plays each other twice\u2014home and away. So, it should be 2(n - 1) weeks. Let's see: 2 \u00d7 (12 - 1) = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22 weeks.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it in terms of graph theory, where teams are vertices and games are edges, this is like finding a 1-factorization of the complete graph K_12, and then doubling it since each edge appears twice (once for each direction).\n\nIn any case, the total number of games is 132, and the minimum number of weeks required is 22.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Total number of games: 132\n\n- Minimum number of weeks: 22\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
