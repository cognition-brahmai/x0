        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 30 students, and there are twice as many girls as boys. First, I need to figure out how many boys and girls are there currently.\n\nLet me denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. According to the problem, G = 2B, and the total number of students is B + G = 30.\n\nSubstituting G with 2B, we get B + 2B = 30, which simplifies to 3B = 30. So, B = 10. That means there are 10 boys and G = 2 * 10 = 20 girls.\n\nNow, 5 more boys join the class. So, the new number of boys is 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nWe need to find out how many girls need to join to keep the same ratio of girls to boys. The original ratio was G:B = 20:10 = 2:1.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of girls who need to join as X. So, the new number of girls will be 20 + X.\n\nWe want the new ratio to be the same as the original, which is 2:1. So, (20 + X)/15 = 2/1.\n\nNow, solving for X:\n\n(20 + X)/15 = 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 15: 20 + X = 30\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides: X = 10\n\nTherefore, 10 girls need to join the class to maintain the same ratio of girls to boys after 5 more boys have joined.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that.\n\nOriginal number of boys: 10\n\nOriginal number of girls: 20\n\nRatio: 20:10 = 2:1\n\nAfter 5 boys join: 15 boys\n\nIf 10 girls join: 30 girls\n\nNew ratio: 30:15 = 2:1\n\nYes, that matches the original ratio.\n\nSo, the answer is that 10 girls need to join the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
