        "content": "Let's see. There's a $200 restaurant bill that needs to be split evenly among a group of people, and each person is contributing $25. I need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nSo, if each person pays $25, and the total bill is $200, I can probably find the number of people by dividing the total bill by the amount each person pays. That makes sense because if you have, say, 4 people each paying $25, that would be $100, which is not enough for the $200 bill. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. If each person pays $25, and there are x people, then the total amount collected would be 25 times x, and that should equal $200. So, the equation would be:\n\n25x = 200\n\nNow, to find x, I just need to divide both sides by 25:\n\nx = 200 / 25\n\nLet me do the division: 200 divided by 25 is 8.\n\nSo, there are 8 people in the group.\n\nBut let me double-check. If 8 people each pay $25, that's 8 times 25, which is $200. Yes, that matches the total bill.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of how much each person needs to pay to cover the total bill. Since the bill is $200 and they want to split it evenly, each person's share would be $200 divided by the number of people. But in this case, they're each contributing $25, so I set that equal to the share.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in this problem, they're each contributing $25, and I need to find out how many such contributions make up $200.\n\nSo, again, it's just dividing the total bill by the amount per person.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward. So, the answer is 8 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
