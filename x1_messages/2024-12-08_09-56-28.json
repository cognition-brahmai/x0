        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to build a simple chat server using WebSockets in TypeScript. I'm not super experienced with WebSockets, but I've done some research and I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a basic WebSocket server. I heard that the 'ws' library is pretty popular for this. So, I should probably install that.\n\nLet me open up my terminal and create a new directory for this project.\n\n```\nmkdir chat-server\ncd chat-server\n```\n\nNow, I'll initialize a new Node.js project.\n\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nNext, I'll install the 'ws' library and TypeScript.\n\n```\nnpm install ws\nnpm install typescript @types/node @types/ws --save-dev\n```\n\nOkay, now I need to set up TypeScript. I'll create a 'tsconfig.json' file.\n\n```\nnpx tsc --init\n```\n\nI'll accept the default settings for now.\n\nNow, I'll create a new file called 'server.ts' where I'll write my server code.\n\nLet me start by importing the WebSocket library.\n\n```typescript\nimport * as WebSocket from 'ws';\n```\n\nNext, I need to create a new WebSocket server instance. I think I can do that by creating a new instance of 'WebSocket.Server'.\n\n```typescript\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });\n```\n\nSo, this should create a WebSocket server listening on port 8080.\n\nNow, I need to handle new connections. I can listen for the 'connection' event on the 'wss' instance.\n\n```typescript\nwss.on('connection', (ws: WebSocket) => {\n  console.log('A client connected');\n\n  ws.on('message', (message: string) => {\n    console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', () => {\n    console.log('A client disconnected');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis looks good. Now, when a client connects, it logs a message, and when a message is received, it logs that message, and when a client disconnects, it logs another message.\n\nBut I need to broadcast messages to all connected clients. So, I need a way to send a message to all clients when a message is received from one client.\n\nI think I can store all connected clients in an array and iterate over that array to send messages to each client.\n\nLet me add that.\n\n```typescript\nconst clients: WebSocket[] = [];\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws: WebSocket) => {\n  clients.push(ws);\n  console.log('A client connected');\n\n  ws.on('message', (message: string) => {\n    console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);\n\n    // Broadcast the message to all clients\n    clients.forEach(client => {\n      if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n        client.send(message);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', () => {\n    const index = clients.indexOf(ws);\n    if (index !== -1) {\n      clients.splice(index, 1);\n    }\n    console.log('A client disconnected');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOkay, so now I'm keeping track of all connected clients in the 'clients' array. When a new client connects, I add it to the array. When a client disconnects, I remove it from the array.\n\nWhen a message is received from a client, I broadcast that message to all other connected clients, checking if their readyState is OPEN before sending the message.\n\nThis should handle the broadcasting part.\n\nNow, I also need to display a list of currently connected users. Hmm, how can I do that?\n\nI think I can maintain another array that holds the names or identifiers of the connected users. But for that, I need a way to identify each user.\n\nMaybe when a user connects, they send a message with their username, and I store that username associated with their WebSocket connection.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nI can modify the 'connection' event handler to expect a message from the client right after connecting, containing their username.\n\nBut that might not be the best way. Maybe I can use a map to associate usernames with WebSocket instances.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nI'll create a Map where the key is the WebSocket instance and the value is the username.\n\n```typescript\nconst clients = new Map<WebSocket, string>();\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws: WebSocket) => {\n  console.log('A client connected');\n\n  ws.on('message', (message: string) => {\n    if (!clients.has(ws)) {\n      // Assume the first message is the username\n      const username = message;\n      clients.set(ws, username);\n      console.log(`${username} has connected`);\n      // Broadcast that a new user has joined\n      broadcast(`${username} has joined the chat`);\n    } else {\n      // It's a regular message\n      const username = clients.get(ws);\n      console.log(`${username}: ${message}`);\n      // Broadcast the message with the username\n      broadcast(`${username}: ${message}`);\n    }\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', () => {\n    const username = clients.get(ws);\n    if (username) {\n      console.log(`${username} disconnected`);\n      clients.delete(ws);\n      // Broadcast that a user has left\n      broadcast(`${username} has left the chat`);\n    }\n  });\n});\n\nfunction broadcast(message: string) {\n  clients.forEach((username, client) => {\n    if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n      client.send(message);\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nOkay, so now I'm using a Map to associate usernames with WebSocket instances.\n\nWhen a client connects, their first message is considered their username, which I store in the map.\n\nThen, any subsequent messages are broadcast with their username prefixed.\n\nAlso, when a client disconnects, I remove them from the map and broadcast that they have left the chat.\n\nThis seems better.\n\nNow, to display the list of connected users, I can maintain another array that holds the usernames of connected users, and whenever a user connects or disconnects, I update this array.\n\nBut actually, since I'm using a Map already, I can just extract the usernames from the map.\n\nWait, the Map holds all the usernames associated with their WebSocket instances. So, to get the list of connected users, I can just get the keys of the map and extract the usernames.\n\nLet me add a function to get the list of connected usernames.\n\n```typescript\nfunction getConnectedUsernames(): string[] {\n  return Array.from(clients.values());\n}\n```\n\nGreat, now I can get an array of connected usernames.\n\nBut how do I display this list? Do I need to send it to the clients?\n\nProbably, yes. Maybe when a new client connects, I can send them the list of currently connected users.\n\nAnd maybe periodically update the list for all clients.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nWhen a new client connects, I can send them the list of connected users.\n\nAlso, whenever a user joins or leaves, I can broadcast the updated list to all clients.\n\nLet me modify the code accordingly.\n\nFirst, modify the 'connection' event handler to send the list of connected users to the new client after they've set their username.\n\nAlso, modify the 'close' event handler to broadcast the updated user list when a user disconnects.\n\n```typescript\nwss.on('connection', (ws: WebSocket) => {\n  console.log('A client connected');\n\n  ws.on('message', (message: string) => {\n    if (!clients.has(ws)) {\n      // Assume the first message is the username\n      const username = message;\n      clients.set(ws, username);\n      console.log(`${username} has connected`);\n      // Send the list of connected users to the new client\n      const connectedUsers = getConnectedUsernames();\n      ws.send(`Connected users: ${connectedUsers.join(', ')}`);\n      // Broadcast that a new user has joined\n      broadcast(`${username} has joined the chat`);\n    } else {\n      // It's a regular message\n      const username = clients.get(ws);\n      console.log(`${username}: ${message}`);\n      // Broadcast the message with the username\n      broadcast(`${username}: ${message}`);\n    }\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', () => {\n    const username = clients.get(ws);\n    if (username) {\n      console.log(`${username} disconnected`);\n      clients.delete(ws);\n      // Broadcast that a user has left\n      broadcast(`${username} has left the chat`);\n      // Broadcast the updated list of connected users\n      const connectedUsers = getConnectedUsernames();\n      broadcast(`Connected users: ${connectedUsers.join(', ')}`);\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOkay, so now when a new client connects and sends their username, the server sends them the list of connected users, and broadcasts to all clients that a new user has joined.\n\nWhen a client disconnects, the server removes them from the map, broadcasts that they've left, and sends the updated list of connected users to all clients.\n\nThis should keep all clients updated about who is connected.\n\nI think this covers the requirements: multiple clients connecting simultaneously, broadcasting messages to all connected clients, and displaying a list of currently connected users.\n\nLet me test this.\n\nFirst, I need to compile the TypeScript code.\n\n```\nnpx tsc\n```\n\nThis should compile 'server.ts' into 'server.js'.\n\nThen, I can run the server.\n\n```\nnode server.js\n```\n\nNow, I'll need at least two clients to connect to this server to test the chat functionality.\n\nI can use the WebSocket Client for browsers or some other WebSocket client tool.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a simple client in Node.js to test.\n\nLet me quickly write a client in Node.js using the 'ws' library.\n\nCreate a file called 'client.ts'.\n\n```typescript\nimport * as WebSocket from 'ws';\n\nconst ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');\n\nws.on('open', () => {\n  console.log('Connected to server');\n  ws.send('User1'); // Send username\n});\n\nws.on('message', (message: string) => {\n  console.log(`Received: ${message}`);\n});\n```\n\nSimilarly, create another client file called 'client2.ts'.\n\n```typescript\nimport * as WebSocket from 'ws';\n\nconst ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');\n\nws.on('open', () => {\n  console.log('Connected to server');\n  ws.send('User2'); // Send username\n});\n\nws.on('message', (message: string) => {\n  console.log(`Received: ${message}`);\n});\n```\n\nCompile both clients.\n\n```\nnpx tsc\n```\n\nNow, run the server and both clients in separate terminals.\n\nIn terminal 1:\n\n```\nnode server.js\n```\n\nIn terminal 2:\n\n```\nnode client.js\n```\n\nIn terminal 3:\n\n```\nnode client2.js\n```\n\nNow, in terminal 2 (User1), send a message.\n\n```\nws.send('Hello, User2!');\n```\n\nIn terminal 3 (User2), I should see:\n\n```\nReceived: User1: Hello, User2!\n```\n\nSimilarly, if User2 sends a message, User1 should receive it.\n\nAlso, when a new user connects, existing users should see the list update.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nStart the server and connect User1.\n\nThen connect User2.\n\nIn both clients, they should receive:\n\n```\nConnected users: User1, User2\n```\n\nWhen User2 disconnects, both should receive:\n\n```\nUser2 has left the chat\nConnected users: User1\n```\n\nSeems to be working as expected.\n\nI think I've successfully created a simple chat server using WebSockets in TypeScript that supports multiple clients, broadcasts messages, and displays a list of connected users.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple chat server using WebSockets in TypeScript, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up the Project:**\n   - Initialize a new directory and navigate into it.\n   - Initialize a new Node.js project.\n   - Install necessary dependencies: `ws` for WebSockets and `typescript` along with type definitions.\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir chat-server\n    cd chat-server\n    npm init -y\n    npm install ws\n    npm install typescript @types/node @types/ws --save-dev\n    ```\n\n2. **Configure TypeScript:**\n   - Generate a `tsconfig.json` file to compile TypeScript files.\n\n    ```bash\n    npx tsc --init\n    ```\n\n3. **Create the Server:**\n   - Create a `server.ts` file to set up the WebSocket server.\n\n    ```typescript\n    import * as WebSocket from 'ws';\n\n    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });\n    const clients = new Map<WebSocket, string>();\n\n    wss.on('connection', (ws: WebSocket) => {\n      console.log('A client connected');\n\n      ws.on('message', (message: string) => {\n        if (!clients.has(ws)) {\n          // Assume the first message is the username\n          const username = message;\n          clients.set(ws, username);\n          console.log(`${username} has connected`);\n          // Send the list of connected users to the new client\n          const connectedUsers = getConnectedUsernames();\n          ws.send(`Connected users: ${connectedUsers.join(', ')}`);\n          // Broadcast that a new user has joined\n          broadcast(`${username} has joined the chat`);\n        } else {\n          // It's a regular message\n          const username = clients.get(ws);\n          console.log(`${username}: ${message}`);\n          // Broadcast the message with the username\n          broadcast(`${username}: ${message}`);\n        }\n      });\n\n      ws.on('close', () => {\n        const username = clients.get(ws);\n        if (username) {\n          console.log(`${username} disconnected`);\n          clients.delete(ws);\n          // Broadcast that a user has left\n          broadcast(`${username} has left the chat`);\n          // Broadcast the updated list of connected users\n          const connectedUsers = getConnectedUsernames();\n          broadcast(`Connected users: ${connectedUsers.join(', ')}`);\n        }\n      });\n    });\n\n    function broadcast(message: string) {\n      clients.forEach((username, client) => {\n        if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {\n          client.send(message);\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n    function getConnectedUsernames(): string[] {\n      return Array.from(clients.values());\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. **Compile and Run the Server:**\n   - Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.\n   - Run the generated JavaScript server.\n\n    ```bash\n    npx tsc\n    node server.js\n    ```\n\n5. **Create Clients to Test:**\n   - Create simple client files (`client1.ts`, `client2.ts`, etc.) to connect to the server and send messages.\n\n    ```typescript\n    import * as WebSocket from 'ws';\n\n    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');\n\n    ws.on('open', () => {\n      console.log('Connected to server');\n      ws.send('User1'); // Send username\n    });\n\n    ws.on('message', (message: string) => {\n      console.log(`Received: ${message}`);\n    });\n    ```\n\n   - Compile and run multiple client instances to test the chat functionality.\n\n    ```bash\n    npx tsc\n    node client1.js\n    node client2.js\n    ```\n\nThis setup allows multiple clients to connect to the WebSocket server, send messages that are broadcast to all connected clients, and view a list of currently connected users. The server manages user connections, maintains a list of usernames, and updates clients about join and leave events."
