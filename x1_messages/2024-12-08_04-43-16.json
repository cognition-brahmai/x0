        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a water tank holds 450 liters of water, and it takes 3 minutes to fill up 1/6 of the tank. I need to find out how long it will take to fill up the entire tank. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The tank has a total capacity of 450 liters, and filling up 1/6 of it takes 3 minutes. So, I need to find out the time required to fill up the whole tank.\n\nMaybe I can start by figuring out how much water is being filled in those 3 minutes. Since 1/6 of the tank is being filled in 3 minutes, I can calculate the amount of water that represents.\n\nLet me calculate 1/6 of 450 liters:\n\n1/6 * 450 = 75 liters.\n\nSo, 75 liters are being filled in 3 minutes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it takes to fill up the entire 450 liters.\n\nOne way to approach this is to determine the filling rate and then use that to find the total time.\n\nSo, the filling rate is 75 liters in 3 minutes. That means the rate is:\n\n75 liters / 3 minutes = 25 liters per minute.\n\nNow, if the tank holds 450 liters, and the filling rate is 25 liters per minute, then the time required to fill the entire tank would be:\n\nTotal time = Total volume / Filling rate\n\nTotal time = 450 liters / 25 liters per minute\n\nTotal time = 18 minutes.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, since 1/6 of the tank takes 3 minutes to fill, then the whole tank, which is 6/6, should take 6 times longer.\n\nSo, time to fill the whole tank = 3 minutes * 6 = 18 minutes.\n\nThat matches the previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion.\n\nIf 1/6 of the tank takes 3 minutes, then:\n\n(1/6) / 3 = 1 / x\n\nWait, no. Let's set it up correctly.\n\nActually, better to set it up as:\n\n(1/6) tank / 3 minutes = 1 tank / x minutes\n\nThen, solve for x:\n\nx = 3 minutes * (1 tank) / (1/6 tank)\n\nx = 3 * 6\n\nx = 18 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that it will take 18 minutes to fill the entire tank.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how much time it takes to fill one liter and then multiply by the total liters.\n\nFirst, find the time to fill one liter.\n\nWe know that 75 liters take 3 minutes, so:\n\nTime per liter = 3 minutes / 75 liters = 0.04 minutes per liter.\n\nNow, for 450 liters:\n\nTotal time = 450 liters * 0.04 minutes per liter = 18 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the rate:\n\nRate = 75 liters / 3 minutes = 25 liters per minute.\n\nTime = total volume / rate = 450 / 25 = 18 minutes.\n\nHmm, I keep getting 18 minutes no matter which way I approach it.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect the filling time, like if the rate changes over time, but the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nIt seems straightforward that the filling rate is constant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 18 minutes.\n\nWait a second, just to be thorough, let's consider the units.\n\nWe have liters and minutes, and we're dealing with rates, so making sure the units cancel out correctly is important.\n\nIn the rate approach:\n\nRate = 75 liters / 3 minutes = 25 liters per minute.\n\nThen, time = 450 liters / 25 liters per minute.\n\nLiters divided by (liters per minute) gives minutes, which is correct.\n\nIn the proportion approach:\n\n(1/6 tank) / 3 minutes = 1 tank / x minutes.\n\nCross-multiplying: (1/6)x = 3\n\nThen, x = 3 * 6 = 18 minutes.\n\nUnits are consistent.\n\nIn the per liter approach:\n\nTime per liter = 3 minutes / 75 liters = 0.04 minutes per liter.\n\nThen, total time = 450 liters * 0.04 minutes per liter = 18 minutes.\n\nAgain, units are consistent.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough that the answer is indeed 18 minutes.\n\nPerhaps I can try another approach, like using fractions throughout.\n\nIf 1/6 of the tank takes 3 minutes, then the full tank would take 6 times that amount.\n\nSo, 6 * 3 minutes = 18 minutes.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of rates, the rate is 1/6 tank per 3 minutes, which is equivalent to 1/18 tank per minute.\n\nThen, to fill 1 tank, time = 1 / (1/18) = 18 minutes.\n\nAgain, confirming the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that no matter which method I use, the answer remains consistent at 18 minutes.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that it will take 18 minutes to fill up the entire tank.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
