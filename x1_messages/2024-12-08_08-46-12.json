        "content": "Let's see. There's a group of people who want to split a $120 meal evenly. Each person is contributing $15. I need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nSo, if each person pays $15, and the total is $120, I think I can find the number of people by dividing the total amount by the amount each person pays. That makes sense because if you have, say, 4 people each paying $15, that would be $60, which is less than $120. So, I need to see how many $15 contributions make up $120.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal cost = $120\n\nEach person's contribution = $15\n\nNumber of people = Total cost / Each person's contribution\n\nSo, number of people = $120 / $15\n\nNow, $120 divided by $15 is 8. So, there are 8 people in the group.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If 8 people each pay $15, that's 8 times 15, which is $120. Yes, that matches the total cost. So, my answer is correct.\n\nI think that's it. It was a straightforward division problem. But I'm glad I double-checked to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
