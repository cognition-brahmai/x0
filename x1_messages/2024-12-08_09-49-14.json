        "content": "So the bee flies 15 miles to gather nectar and then returns back to its hive. To find out the total miles the bee flies in one round trip, I need to consider both the outgoing and returning flights.\n\nFirst, the bee flies 15 miles to reach the nectar source. That's the outgoing part of the trip.\n\nThen, it flies back the same distance to return to the hive. So that's another 15 miles for the return trip.\n\nTo find the total distance for the round trip, I should add both distances together.\n\nSo, 15 miles (to the nectar) + 15 miles (back to the hive) = 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the bee flies a total of 30 miles in one round trip.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe multiplying the one-way distance by two since it's a round trip.\n\nYes, that makes sense too. 15 miles \u00d7 2 = 30 miles.\n\nBoth methods give the same result, which reassures me that 30 miles is the correct total distance for the round trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
