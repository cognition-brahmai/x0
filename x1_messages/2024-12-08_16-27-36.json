        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory originally produces 200 widgets per hour. Then, there's an increase in demand, and they boost production by 50%. Okay, so first, I need to figure out what 50% more than 200 is.\n\nWell, 50% of 200 is 100, right? Because 0.5 times 200 is 100. So, adding that to the original 200, the new production rate is 300 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, they maintain this increased rate for two hours. So, in those two hours, they produce 300 widgets per hour times 2 hours, which is 600 widgets.\n\nAfter that, a machine breaks down, and production drops to 75% of the original rate. The original rate was 200 widgets per hour, so 75% of that would be 0.75 times 200, which is 150 widgets per hour.\n\nThe factory operates for a total of 8 hours. They've already spent 2 hours at the increased rate, so that leaves 6 hours operating at the reduced rate of 150 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, in those 6 hours, they produce 150 widgets per hour times 6 hours, which is 900 widgets.\n\nNow, to find the total production, I need to add the widgets produced at the increased rate and the widgets produced at the reduced rate. That's 600 plus 900, which equals 1500 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. The factory operates for 8 hours total. First, 2 hours at 300 widgets per hour, which is 600 widgets. Then, 6 hours at 150 widgets per hour, which is 900 widgets. Adding those together, 600 plus 900 does indeed equal 1500 widgets.\n\nSo, the total production is 1500 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\]"
