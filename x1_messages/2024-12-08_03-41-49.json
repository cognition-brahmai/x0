        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if it takes 6 workers 8 hours to build a wall, how long will it take for 12 workers to build the same wall? Hmm, this seems like a straightforward problem involving inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task. Basically, if you have more workers, you should be able to finish the job faster, assuming they all work at the same rate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken. If 6 workers take 8 hours, then doubling the number of workers to 12 should halve the time, right? Because twice as many people should be able to do the job in half the time, assuming everything else stays the same.\n\nLet me check that. So, 6 workers take 8 hours. That means the total amount of work is 6 workers times 8 hours, which is 48 worker-hours. This is a way to measure the total effort required to build the wall. No matter how many workers you have, the total effort needed remains the same.\n\nSo, if you have 12 workers, you can set up the equation: 12 workers times the number of hours (let's call it h) equals 48 worker-hours. So, 12h = 48. Solving for h, h = 48 / 12 = 4 hours.\n\nThat makes sense. Doubling the number of workers halves the time required. So, 12 workers should take 4 hours to build the same wall.\n\nBut wait, is there any other factor to consider? For example, maybe with more workers, there could be inefficiencies like getting in each other's way or having to share tools, which could slow them down. But in this problem, it doesn't mention any such issues, so I think it's safe to assume that the relationship is purely inversely proportional.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the work rate per worker. If 6 workers take 8 hours, then each worker is contributing 1/6 of the work per hour, but that might not be the easiest way to think about it.\n\nI think the total work effort approach is the most straightforward. The total work required is 48 worker-hours. So, for any number of workers, you can divide the total work by the number of workers to find the time required.\n\nLet me try it with different numbers to see if it makes sense. Suppose only 8 workers were available. Then, time taken would be 48 / 8 = 6 hours. Similarly, if there were 3 workers, it would take 48 / 3 = 16 hours. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, with 12 workers, it should take 4 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of work rates. If 6 workers take 8 hours, then the combined work rate is 1 wall per 8 hours. So, the work rate per worker is (1 wall)/(6 workers * 8 hours) = 1/48 walls per worker-hour.\n\nNow, if you have 12 workers, their combined work rate is 12 * (1/48) = 12/48 = 1/4 walls per hour. So, to build 1 wall, it would take 1 / (1/4) = 4 hours. Same answer as before.\n\nGood, two different methods leading to the same conclusion reinforces that 4 hours is the correct answer.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions. Since the number of workers and the time taken are inversely proportional, the product of the number of workers and the time should be constant.\n\nSo, workers1 * time1 = workers2 * time2\n\nPlugging in the values: 6 * 8 = 12 * time2\n\n48 = 12 * time2\n\nTime2 = 48 / 12 = 4 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Seems consistent.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
