Let me fill you in on what's been going on.\n\nStarted off pretty normal, woke up a bit late because I was up late web-slinging last night. Got a bit of a headache from all the acrobatics, but nothing a good cup of coffee couldn't fix. Speaking of which, I totally burned the toast this morning. Again. Maybe I should stick to cereal.\n\nHeaded off to school, trying to look casual, you know? Avoiding Flash and all his questions about where I disappear to during lunch. I swear, that kid has too much time on his hands. Anyway, managed to slip away without too much hassle.\n\nThen, mid-afternoon, I got the spider-sense tingling, so I zipped off to check it out. Turns out, some guys were trying to rob a convenience store. Classic crime, but someone's got to stop it, right? So, I swung in,webslinged a few bad guys, and saved the day. Nothing too exciting, but it's all in a day's work.\n\nOn my way back, I saw that new science exhibit at the museum was open. Figured I'd swing by, see if there's anything interesting. Turns out, they have this cool display on spiders and their webs. It's fascinating! I learned a thing or two about web mechanics that might come in handy for my own webs. Who knew science could be so practical?\n\nAfter that, I had to rush home to finish up some homework. Mr. Harrington's history project is due tomorrow, and I'm still working on it. I tried to research using my spider-sense, but turns out, it's not that great at\u5386\u53f2 dates. Maybe I need to work on that.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to check in and let you know I'm okay. No major disasters today, which is always a plus. Love you, Aunt May!\n\n**- Your nephew, Peter**"
