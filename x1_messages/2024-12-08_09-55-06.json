        "content": "So I have this problem: \"How many positive integers less than 1000 have exactly five divisors?\" Hmm, interesting. I need to find all the numbers below 1000 that have exactly five positive divisors. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that the number of divisors of a number can be determined from its prime factorization. If a number \\( n \\) has a prime factorization of \\( n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_k^{a_k} \\), then the total number of positive divisors is \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\\dots(a_k + 1) \\).\n\nSo, for a number to have exactly five divisors, the product of these increments must be five. Now, five is a prime number, so its only positive divisors are 1 and 5. This means that the only possible way to have \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\\dots(a_k + 1) = 5 \\) is if one of the exponents plus one is 5, and all others are 1. In other words, one exponent is 4, and all others are 0. So, the number must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\nWait a minute, is that the only possibility? Let me double-check. If I have more than one prime factor, say \\( p^a \\times q^b \\), then the number of divisors would be \\( (a+1)(b+1) \\). For this to be 5, since 5 is prime, one of \\( a+1 \\) or \\( b+1 \\) would have to be 5, and the other would have to be 1. So, say \\( a+1 = 5 \\) and \\( b+1 = 1 \\), which means \\( a = 4 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\). Similarly, if \\( a+1 = 1 \\) and \\( b+1 = 5 \\), that would mean \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 4 \\). So, the number is either \\( p^4 \\) or \\( q^4 \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes. But wait, in the second case, it's still of the form \\( r^4 \\), where \\( r \\) is a prime. So, essentially, the number must be the fourth power of a prime number.\n\nIs there any other way to have exactly five divisors? Let's see. If I consider higher exponents or more primes, the product \\( (a+1)(b+1)\\dots \\) would be larger than 5 or have more factors, which wouldn't help since 5 is prime. So, no, the only possibility is \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is prime.\n\nAlright, so now I need to find all primes \\( p \\) such that \\( p^4 < 1000 \\). Then, the number of such primes will be the answer.\n\nLet me calculate \\( p^4 \\) for various primes and see which ones are less than 1000.\n\nStart with the smallest prime:\n\n- \\( p = 2 \\): \\( 2^4 = 16 \\), which is less than 1000.\n\n- \\( p = 3 \\): \\( 3^4 = 81 \\), still less than 1000.\n\n- \\( p = 5 \\): \\( 5^4 = 625 \\), still under 1000.\n\n- \\( p = 7 \\): \\( 7^4 = 2401 \\), which is greater than 1000.\n\nWait, 7^4 is 2401, which is indeed greater than 1000. So, primes larger than 5 will have \\( p^4 \\) exceeding 1000.\n\nBut let's confirm the calculations to be sure.\n\n- \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n\n- \\( 3^4 = 81 \\)\n\n- \\( 5^4 = 625 \\)\n\n- \\( 7^4 = 2401 \\)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, primes greater than or equal to 7 will have \\( p^4 \\) greater than or equal to 2401, which is beyond our limit of 1000.\n\nTherefore, the only primes \\( p \\) for which \\( p^4 < 1000 \\) are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nWait a second, is there any prime between 5 and 7? No, the next prime after 5 is 7. So, those are the only three primes to consider.\n\nTherefore, there are three positive integers less than 1000 that have exactly five divisors: 16, 81, and 625.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nFirst, confirm that each of these numbers has exactly five divisors.\n\nTake 16:\n\n- Divisors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. That's five divisors.\n\nTake 81:\n\n- Divisors of 81: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81. Five divisors.\n\nTake 625:\n\n- Divisors of 625: 1, 5, 25, 125, 625. Five divisors.\n\nPerfect. Now, are there any other numbers less than 1000 with exactly five divisors?\n\nWait a minute, is there any number that is the fourth power of a prime and less than 1000 besides these three? Let's see.\n\nWe have:\n\n- \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n\n- \\( 3^4 = 81 \\)\n\n- \\( 5^4 = 625 \\)\n\n- \\( 7^4 = 2401 \\), which is too big.\n\nNext prime is 11, \\( 11^4 = 14641 \\), way beyond 1000.\n\nSo, no, those are the only three.\n\nAlternatively, is there any other form a number could take to have exactly five divisors? For example, if it's a product of two primes raised to certain powers.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that the only possibility is \\( p^4 \\), but maybe I should verify that.\n\nSuppose a number is \\( p^a \\times q^b \\). Then, the number of divisors is \\( (a+1)(b+1) \\). For this to be 5, since 5 is prime, one of \\( a+1 \\) or \\( b+1 \\) must be 5, and the other must be 1. So, say \\( a+1 = 5 \\) and \\( b+1 = 1 \\), which means \\( a = 4 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), so the number is \\( p^4 \\). Alternatively, \\( a+1 = 1 \\) and \\( b+1 = 5 \\), which means \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 4 \\), so the number is \\( q^4 \\). So, again, it's the fourth power of a single prime.\n\nWhat if the number is a product of three primes? Say \\( p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c \\). Then, the number of divisors is \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) \\). For this product to be 5, since 5 is prime, one of the exponents plus one must be 5, and the others must be 1. So, say \\( a+1 = 5 \\), \\( b+1 = 1 \\), \\( c+1 = 1 \\), which means \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\), so the number is \\( p^4 \\). Similarly for other permutations. So, again, it reduces to \\( p^4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is numbers of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is prime.\n\nHence, the answer should be three: 16, 81, and 625.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any number less than 1000 that has exactly five divisors but is not a fourth power of a prime?\n\nI can't think of any off the top of my head. It seems that the only way to have exactly five divisors is to be the fourth power of a prime.\n\nTherefore, the answer is three.\n\nWait, but I recall that for a number to have an odd number of divisors, it must be a perfect square. Because divisors come in pairs, except when a divisor is repeated, which happens in perfect squares. So, numbers with exactly five divisors must be perfect squares.\n\nIndeed, 16 is 4 squared, 81 is 9 squared, and 625 is 25 squared. So, they are all perfect squares.\n\nIs there any other perfect square less than 1000 that has exactly five divisors? Let's check.\n\nFor a number to have exactly five divisors, it must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), as established earlier.\n\nWait, but is there another way for a number to have exactly five divisors? Maybe if it's a product of two squares or something? Let's see.\n\nSuppose a number is \\( p^2 \\times q^2 \\). Then, the number of divisors would be \\( (2+1)(2+1) = 9 \\), which is more than five.\n\nAlternatively, \\( p^4 \\times q^0 \\), which is just \\( p^4 \\), as before.\n\nSo, no, there doesn't seem to be another way.\n\nTherefore, the answer is three.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me list all primes whose fourth power is less than 1000.\n\nPrimes less than \\( \\sqrt[4]{1000} \\).\n\nWait, what's the fourth root of 1000? That would be \\( 1000^{1/4} \\). Let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, \\( 1000 = 10^3 \\), so \\( 1000^{1/4} = (10^3)^{1/4} = 10^{3/4} \\). Now, \\( 10^{3/4} \\) is approximately \\( 10^{0.75} \\). I know that \\( 10^{0.5} \\) is about 3.162, and \\( 10^{1} \\) is 10. So, \\( 10^{0.75} \\) should be between 3.162 and 10. Maybe around 5.62.\n\nLet me check \\( 5^4 = 625 \\), which is less than 1000, and \\( 6^4 = 1296 \\), which is greater than 1000. So, primes less than or equal to 5.\n\nPrimes less than or equal to 5 are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nSo, the numbers are \\( 2^4 = 16 \\), \\( 3^4 = 81 \\), and \\( 5^4 = 625 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are three such numbers.\n\nWait a second, is there a prime between 5 and 7 that I missed? No, 5 and 7 are consecutive primes.\n\nSo, the answer is three.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there are any other forms that could give exactly five divisors.\n\nSuppose a number is \\( p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c \\times \\dots \\), and the product \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots = 5 \\). Since 5 is prime, the only way this can happen is if one of the exponents plus one is 5, and all others are 1. But if there are multiple primes, and we set one exponent to 4 and others to 0, it still reduces to \\( p^4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, if I have a higher power, say \\( p^a \\), where \\( a+1 = 5 \\), so \\( a = 4 \\), again \\( p^4 \\).\n\nSo, no other possibilities.\n\nHence, the answer is three.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
