        "content": "Let's see. So, the train usually travels at 60 km/h and takes 2 hours to reach its destination. If it increases its speed by 50%, how long will it take to reach the same destination?\n\nFirst, I need to find out how far the destination is. Since speed is 60 km/h and time is 2 hours, distance should be speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance equals 60 km/h times 2 hours, which is 120 kilometers.\n\nNow, if the train increases its speed by 50%, what's the new speed? Fifty percent of 60 km/h is 30 km/h, so the new speed is 60 km/h plus 30 km/h, which is 90 km/h.\n\nOkay, now I need to find out how long it takes to travel 120 kilometers at 90 km/h. Time is distance divided by speed, so time equals 120 km divided by 90 km/h.\n\nLet me calculate that: 120 divided by 90 is 1.333..., which is 1 and 1/3 hours. To convert that into minutes, 1/3 of an hour is 20 minutes, so the total time is 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nWait, but maybe I should express it in hours. 1.333... hours is approximately 1.33 hours. But since the original time was given in hours, maybe I should leave it in hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it in fractional form as 4/3 hours, since 1.333... is equal to 4/3.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to express it as 4/3 hours or 1 hour and 20 minutes, depending on what the question prefers.\n\nBut since the original time was given in hours, maybe I should stick with hours.\n\nSo, the time taken at the increased speed is 4/3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I can say 1.333... hours, which is 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nWait, actually, 1/3 of an hour is exactly 20 minutes, so 1.333... hours is exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nSo, both ways, it's the same.\n\nTherefore, the train will take 1 hour and 20 minutes to reach the destination at the increased speed.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
