        "content": "So the company makes 250 units every day, and each unit costs $12 to make. They work for 30 days in a month. I need to find out their total monthly production cost.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units they produce in a month. Since they make 250 units per day and work for 30 days, I can multiply 250 by 30 to get the total monthly production.\n\n250 units/day * 30 days = 7,500 units/month\n\nNow, each unit costs $12 to make. So, to find the total monthly cost, I need to multiply the number of units produced in a month by the cost per unit.\n\n7,500 units * $12/unit = $90,000\n\nSo, their total monthly production cost is $90,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other cost involved here? Like overhead costs or anything else? The question only mentions the manufacturing cost per unit, so I think just multiplying the number of units by the cost per unit should give me the total monthly production cost.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check. If they produce 250 units per day at $12 each, that's 250 * 12 = $3,000 per day.\n\nThen, over 30 days, $3,000/day * 30 days = $90,000.\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the total monthly production cost is $90,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90000} \\]"
