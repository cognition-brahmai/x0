        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're looking for three consecutive even integers that add up to 54. First off, I need to remember what consecutive even integers are. Even integers are numbers like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on\u2014numbers that are divisible by 2. Consecutive even integers are even integers that come one after the other without any even numbers in between. For example, 2, 4, and 6 are consecutive even integers.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent these three consecutive even integers. I can let the first integer be a variable, say x. Since they're consecutive even integers, the next one would be x + 2, and the one after that would be x + 4. So, the three integers are x, x + 2, and x + 4.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of these three integers and set it equal to 54. So, x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 54. Now, I'll simplify this equation. Combining like terms, x + x + x is 3x, and 2 + 4 is 6. So, 3x + 6 = 54.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. First, I'll subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x. So, 3x + 6 - 6 = 54 - 6, which simplifies to 3x = 48. Then, I'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for x. So, x = 48 / 3, which is x = 16.\n\nNow that I have x = 16, I can find the other two integers. The next consecutive even integer is x + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18, and the one after that is x + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20. So, the three consecutive even integers are 16, 18, and 20.\n\nTo make sure I'm correct, I'll add them up and check if they equal 54. 16 + 18 + 20 = 54. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this problem differently. Since the integers are consecutive even numbers, their average should be the middle number. And since the sum is 54 for three numbers, the average is 54 / 3 = 18. So, the middle number is 18, which means the numbers are 16, 18, and 20. This confirms my earlier answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the properties of even numbers. Even numbers are spaced two units apart, so if I have three of them, the difference between each is 2. So, if I let the middle number be y, then the three numbers would be y - 2, y, and y + 2. Adding them up: (y - 2) + y + (y + 2) = 3y. And set this equal to 54: 3y = 54, so y = 18. Therefore, the numbers are 16, 18, and 20.\n\nThis confirms again that the three consecutive even integers are 16, 18, and 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16, 18, 20} \\]"
