        "content": "Let's see. If the average human heart beats about 72 times per minute, I need to find out how many times it beats in one day. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, so first I'll calculate the number of minutes in a day.\n\nMinutes in an hour: 60\nHours in a day: 24\nSo, minutes in a day = 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes.\n\nNow, if the heart beats 72 times per minute, then in one day it would beat:\n\n72 beats/minute * 1440 minutes = ?\n\nLet me do the math.\n\n72 * 1440.\n\nWell, 70 * 1440 is 100,800, and 2 * 1440 is 2,880. So total would be 100,800 + 2,880 = 103,680 beats per day.\n\nWait, but I've heard that the average heart beats around 100,000 times a day. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, beats per minute: 72.\n\nMinutes per hour: 60.\n\nHours per day: 24.\n\nSo, beats per hour: 72 * 60 = 4,320 beats per hour.\n\nThen, beats per day: 4,320 * 24.\n\nLet's compute that.\n\n4,320 * 20 = 86,400\n\n4,320 * 4 = 17,280\n\nTotal: 86,400 + 17,280 = 103,680.\n\nHmm, still getting 103,680. Maybe the average is slightly less, or perhaps there's a difference based on age and activity level.\n\nBut based on the given rate of 72 beats per minute, it seems the heart beats about 103,680 times in one day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{103680} \\]"
