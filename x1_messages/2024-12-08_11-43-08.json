        "content": "The sun rises slow, like a dream\nCreeping over the horizon, golden and serene\nBut it's just a game, this dance of day and night\nFor time, it keeps on moving, out of sight\n\nI sit here, watching the world go by\nPeople coming, people going, under the sky\nEach one with their own story to tell\nBut time, it listens not, just keeps on dwelling\n\nOn memories, like old photographs\nYellowed with age, yet still holding on tight\nTo moments that once were, so bright and clear\nNow faded, but still etched in our hearts, year after year\n\nI think of my grandmother, her eyes full of wisdom\nTelling stories of a time long since gone, forgotten, or hidden\nShe says, \"Child, time is like a river, flowing steady and sure\nCarrying us along, to destinations yet obscure\"\n\nBut I wonder, is time really so kind?\nOr does it cruelly steal away our youth, leaving behind\nOnly wrinkles and gray hairs, and hearts that ache\nFor what once was, but can never be regained, no matter how we seek\n\nYet, perhaps time is just a tool, a measure of our days\nA way to organize our lives, in minutes, hours, and phases\nWe can choose to let itpass us by, or seize each moment tight\nMaking memories that will last, beyond the pale of night\n\nSo I'll try to live each day with purpose and grace\nAppreciating the beauty that surrounds me in this place\nFor time, it marches on, relentless and sure\nBut in our hearts, we can hold onto love, forever pure\n\nNote: This poem was written in the style of Langston Hughes, known for his jazz poetry and depiction of the lives of working-class African Americans. His works often explored themes of identity, struggle, and hope."
