        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total, and 15 of them are boys. So, the rest must be girls. That means there are 30 - 15 = 15 girls in the class.\n\nNow, it says that half of the boys wear glasses. So, half of 15 boys would be 15 / 2 = 7.5. But you can't have half a person, so maybe there's a mistake here. Maybe it's 14 boys and 16 girls, or something else. Wait, but the problem says 15 boys and the rest are girls, which would also be 15 girls. So, perhaps it's acceptable to have 7.5, but that doesn't make sense in reality. Maybe it's a typo or an approximation, but I'll proceed with the given numbers.\n\nAssuming that half of the boys wear glasses, that's 7.5 boys wearing glasses. But since we can't have half a person, perhaps it's intended to be 14 boys, with 7 wearing glasses, but I'll stick to the given numbers for now.\n\nThe question is asking for the total number of students who do not wear glasses. To find that, I need to know how many students wear glasses and subtract that from the total number of students.\n\nI know that half of the boys wear glasses, which is 7.5. But I don't have information about whether any of the girls wear glasses or not. The problem doesn't specify anything about the girls wearing glasses, so perhaps no girls wear glasses, or maybe some do. Without that information, it's impossible to give an exact number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's read the problem again: \"In a class of 30 students, 15 are boys and the rest are girls. If half of the boys wear glasses, how many students in total do not wear glasses?\"\n\nHmm, it only mentions that half of the boys wear glasses, but it doesn't say anything about the girls wearing glasses. So, perhaps it's assumed that none of the girls wear glasses. That would make the calculation simpler.\n\nIf none of the girls wear glasses, then only half of the boys wear glasses, which is 7.5. But again, that half boy is confusing. Maybe the problem expects us to consider only whole numbers, so perhaps there are 14 boys and 16 girls, but it clearly says 15 boys and the rest are girls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 15 boys include those who wear glasses and those who don't, and half of them wear glasses, which would be 7.5. But since we can't have half a person, perhaps the problem is hypothetical, or perhaps it's acceptable to have a fractional person in this context.\n\nAssuming that half of the boys wear glasses, that's 7.5 boys wearing glasses. If no girls wear glasses, then the total number of students wearing glasses is 7.5. Therefore, the number of students who do not wear glasses would be the total number of students minus those who wear glasses: 30 - 7.5 = 22.5.\n\nBut again, we can't have half a student, so this answer doesn't make sense in reality. Maybe there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me consider another way. Maybe the problem implies that half of the boys wear glasses, but doesn't specify about the girls, so perhaps some girls also wear glasses. However, without that information, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that only half of the boys wear glasses, and no girls wear glasses, but that leads to the earlier conclusion of 22.5 students not wearing glasses, which is impractical.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the number of boys is even, so perhaps the problem has a mistake, and it should be 14 boys and 16 girls, for example. Then, half of 14 boys would be 7 boys wearing glasses, and if no girls wear glasses, then the total number of students wearing glasses would be 7, and those not wearing glasses would be 30 - 7 = 23.\n\nBut the problem clearly states 15 boys and the rest are girls, so I should stick to that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as exactly half of the boys wearing glasses, which would be 7.5, and since we can't have half a person, maybe it's intended to be understood as 7 or 8 boys wearing glasses. But without further clarification, it's impossible to know.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that 22.5 students do not wear glasses, understanding that in reality, this wouldn't make sense, but perhaps it's a theoretical exercise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to round the number. If half of 15 boys is 7.5, perhaps we round up to 8 boys wearing glasses, or round down to 7. If we round down to 7, then the number of students not wearing glasses would be 30 - 7 = 23. If we round up to 8, it would be 30 - 8 = 22.\n\nBut again, rounding may not be the best approach here, as it's not specified.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to assume that half of the boys wear glasses, which is 7.5, and since we can't have half a person, the answer should be expressed in terms of expected value or something similar, but that might be too advanced for the context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intends for us to consider only whole numbers and there's an error in the problem setup.\n\nGiven all that, I'll assume that half of the boys wear glasses, which is 7.5, and if no girls wear glasses, then 30 - 7.5 = 22.5 students do not wear glasses. But since we can't have half a student, perhaps the answer is 23 students do not wear glasses, rounding down.\n\nBut I'm not confident about this. Maybe I need to consider that the number of boys wearing glasses is 7 or 8, but without more information, it's impossible to know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that exactly half of the boys wear glasses, which is 7.5, and since we can't have half a person, perhaps it's intended to be interpreted as either 7 or 8 boys wearing glasses, but without specification, I can't decide.\n\nGiven all these uncertainties, perhaps the answer is that 23 students do not wear glasses, assuming that 7 boys wear glasses and no girls wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]"
