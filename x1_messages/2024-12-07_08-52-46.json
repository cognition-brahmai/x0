        "content": "So I have this problem here about a rectangular garden. It's currently 20 meters long and 15 meters wide. I need to increase its area by 50%, but I can only do that by changing the length. The width stays the same. I need to figure out what the new length should be.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the current area of the garden is. For a rectangle, area is length times width, right? So, 20 meters times 15 meters would be 300 square meters. That's the original area.\n\nNow, I need to increase this area by 50%. So, what's 50% of 300 square meters? Half of 300 is 150, so increasing by 50% means adding 150 square meters to the original area. That would make the new area 300 plus 150, which is 450 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as multiplying the original area by 1.5 to get a 50% increase. So, 300 times 1.5 is also 450 square meters. Either way, I end up with 450 square meters as the target area.\n\nNow, the width remains unchanged at 15 meters, and I need to find the new length that will give me this new area of 450 square meters. Let's let the new length be L meters.\n\nSince area equals length times width, I can set up the equation:\n\nL times 15 equals 450.\n\nSo, L * 15 = 450.\n\nTo find L, I just need to divide both sides of the equation by 15.\n\nL = 450 / 15.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 450 divided by 15 is 30.\n\nSo, the new length should be 30 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nOriginal area: 20m * 15m = 300 sq m.\n\nNew area: 30m * 15m = 450 sq m.\n\nIndeed, that's a 50% increase from the original area.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage increase directly. If I increase the length from 20m to 30m, that's an increase of 10 meters, which is half of 20 meters, so indeed a 50% increase in length leads to a 50% increase in area, given that width remains constant.\n\nWait, but actually, that's not entirely accurate. If I increase only the length by 50%, from 20m to 30m, and keep the width the same, the area should increase by 50%, which it does, as shown above.\n\nBut the problem says \"increase the area by 50% by only changing the length.\" So, in this case, increasing the length by 50% achieves that.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's another way to look at it. Maybe if I think about proportions or something else.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of the new area to the old area. It's 450 / 300 = 1.5, which is a 50% increase.\n\nSince the width is staying the same, the ratio of the new length to the old length should be equal to the ratio of the new area to the old area, divided by the ratio of the new width to the old width. But since the width isn't changing, the ratio of new width to old width is 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of new length to old length should be equal to the ratio of new area to old area, which is 1.5.\n\nSo, new length = old length * 1.5 = 20m * 1.5 = 30m.\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the area of a rectangle and solve for the new length.\n\nOriginal area (A1) = length1 * width1 = 20m * 15m = 300 sq m.\n\nNew area (A2) = length2 * width2.\n\nBut width2 = width1 = 15m.\n\nAnd A2 = A1 * 1.5 = 300 sq m * 1.5 = 450 sq m.\n\nSo, 450 = length2 * 15.\n\nTherefore, length2 = 450 / 15 = 30m.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about units. All measurements are in meters, and area in square meters, which is consistent throughout the calculations.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the increase is indeed 50%. From 300 sq m to 450 sq m is an increase of 150 sq m, which is exactly 50% of 300 sq m.\n\nI don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n\nSo, the new dimensions of the garden would be a length of 30 meters and a width of 15 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
