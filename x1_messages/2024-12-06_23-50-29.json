Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool is helpful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nUrlCollector[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQuerySolver[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What is the capital of France, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the telephone and when was it patented?"
