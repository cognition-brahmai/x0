        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have four barbers: A, B, C, and D, each with a different number of customers per day. The relationships between their customers are given, and the total number of customers for all four is 84 per day. I need to find out how many customers each barber has.\n\nFirst, let's list out the relationships:\n\n1. Barber A has twice as many customers as Barber B.\n\n2. Barber C has three times more customers than Barber D.\n\nAlso, the total customers are:\n\nA + B + C + D = 84\n\nNow, I need to express these relationships in mathematical terms.\n\nStarting with the first relationship:\n\nA = 2B\n\nThis means that whatever number of customers B has, A has twice that amount.\n\nNext, the second relationship:\n\nBarber C has three times more customers than Barber D.\n\nThis phrase \"three times more\" can be a bit tricky. Does it mean C has 3 times the number of customers D has, or does it mean C has 3 times more in addition to what D has?\n\nLet's clarify this. If someone says \"three times more,\" it usually means C has 3 times the amount D has, in addition to what D has. So, C = D + 3D = 4D.\n\nBut sometimes, people mean C = 3D, which is three times D, not necessarily three times more.\n\nI need to be careful here. Let's consider both interpretations and see which one makes sense in this context.\n\nFirst interpretation: C = 3D (three times D)\n\nSecond interpretation: C = D + 3D = 4D (three times more than D)\n\nI think the more standard interpretation is C = 3D, meaning C has three times the number of customers D has.\n\nSo, I'll go with C = 3D.\n\nNow, summarizing the equations:\n\n1. A = 2B\n\n2. C = 3D\n\n3. A + B + C + D = 84\n\nSince all barbers have different numbers of customers, and they are all positive integers (you can't have a fraction of a customer), I need to find integer values for A, B, C, and D that satisfy these equations.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of one variable to solve for it.\n\nFrom equation 1: A = 2B\n\nFrom equation 2: C = 3D\n\nNow, substitute A and C in equation 3:\n\n2B + B + 3D + D = 84\n\nSimplify:\n\n3B + 4D = 84\n\nNow, I have one equation with two variables: 3B + 4D = 84\n\nI need to find integer values for B and D that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet me solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet's solve for B:\n\n3B = 84 - 4D\n\nB = (84 - 4D)/3\n\nSince B must be an integer, (84 - 4D) must be divisible by 3.\n\nSimilarly, D must be such that B is a positive integer, and also A, C, and D are all different.\n\nLet me consider possible values for D.\n\nD has to be a positive integer, and since C = 3D, C must be at least 3 (if D=1), and so on.\n\nAlso, A = 2B, and A, B, C, D are all different.\n\nLet me try D = 1:\n\nB = (84 - 4*1)/3 = (84 - 4)/3 = 80/3 \u2248 26.6667, not an integer. So D cannot be 1.\n\nD = 2:\n\nB = (84 - 8)/3 = 76/3 \u2248 25.3333, not an integer.\n\nD = 3:\n\nB = (84 - 12)/3 = 72/3 = 24\n\nNow, B = 24\n\nThen A = 2B = 48\n\nC = 3D = 9\n\nNow, check if all are different: A=48, B=24, C=9, D=3. Yes, all different.\n\nCheck the total: 48 + 24 + 9 + 3 = 84. Perfect.\n\nWait a minute, but in this case, C = 9 and D = 3, which satisfies C = 3D.\n\nAnd A = 48, B = 24, which satisfies A = 2B.\n\nAll conditions are met.\n\nBut let's check if there are other possible values for D that also satisfy the equation.\n\nD = 4:\n\nB = (84 - 16)/3 = 68/3 \u2248 22.6667, not an integer.\n\nD = 5:\n\nB = (84 - 20)/3 = 64/3 \u2248 21.3333, not an integer.\n\nD = 6:\n\nB = (84 - 24)/3 = 60/3 = 20\n\nThen A = 40, C = 18\n\nCheck differences: A=40, B=20, C=18, D=6.\n\nAre they all different? Yes.\n\nTotal: 40 + 20 + 18 + 6 = 84.\n\nAnother valid solution.\n\nContinuing:\n\nD = 7:\n\nB = (84 - 28)/3 = 56/3 \u2248 18.6667, not an integer.\n\nD = 8:\n\nB = (84 - 32)/3 = 52/3 \u2248 17.3333, not an integer.\n\nD = 9:\n\nB = (84 - 36)/3 = 48/3 = 16\n\nA = 32, C = 27\n\nCheck: A=32, B=16, C=27, D=9.\n\nAll different? Yes.\n\nTotal: 32 + 16 + 27 + 9 = 84.\n\nAnother valid solution.\n\nD = 10:\n\nB = (84 - 40)/3 = 44/3 \u2248 14.6667, not an integer.\n\nD = 11:\n\nB = (84 - 44)/3 = 40/3 \u2248 13.3333, not an integer.\n\nD = 12:\n\nB = (84 - 48)/3 = 36/3 = 12\n\nA = 24, C = 36\n\nCheck: A=24, B=12, C=36, D=12.\n\nWait, B and D both have 12 customers, but the problem states each barber has a different number of customers. So this is invalid.\n\nD = 12 is not allowed because B and D would have the same number of customers.\n\nD cannot be greater than 12 because B would become less than D, and A would be less than C, but we need to check.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nD = 13:\n\nB = (84 - 52)/3 = 32/3 \u2248 10.6667, not an integer.\n\nD = 14:\n\nB = (84 - 56)/3 = 28/3 \u2248 9.3333, not an integer.\n\nD = 15:\n\nB = (84 - 60)/3 = 24/3 = 8\n\nA = 16, C = 45\n\nCheck: A=16, B=8, C=45, D=15.\n\nAll different? Yes.\n\nTotal: 16 + 8 + 45 + 15 = 84.\n\nValid.\n\nD = 16:\n\nB = (84 - 64)/3 = 20/3 \u2248 6.6667, not an integer.\n\nD = 17:\n\nB = (84 - 68)/3 = 16/3 \u2248 5.3333, not an integer.\n\nD = 18:\n\nB = (84 - 72)/3 = 12/3 = 4\n\nA = 8, C = 54\n\nCheck: A=8, B=4, C=54, D=18.\n\nAll different? Yes.\n\nTotal: 8 + 4 + 54 + 18 = 84.\n\nValid.\n\nD = 19:\n\nB = (84 - 76)/3 = 8/3 \u2248 2.6667, not an integer.\n\nD = 20:\n\nB = (84 - 80)/3 = 4/3 \u2248 1.3333, not an integer.\n\nD = 21:\n\nB = (84 - 84)/3 = 0/3 = 0\n\nB = 0 is not acceptable because a barber can't have zero customers.\n\nSo, the possible integer values for D are 3, 6, 9, 15, 18.\n\nCorresponding B values are:\n\nD=3, B=24\n\nD=6, B=20\n\nD=9, B=16\n\nD=15, B=8\n\nD=18, B=4\n\nNow, let's list all possible solutions:\n\n1. D=3, B=24, A=48, C=9\n\n2. D=6, B=20, A=40, C=18\n\n3. D=9, B=16, A=32, C=27\n\n4. D=15, B=8, A=16, C=45\n\n5. D=18, B=4, A=8, C=54\n\nWait a minute, in solution 4, A=16 and B=8, but earlier I thought A=2B, so A=16 and B=8 satisfies A=2B. Similarly, C=45 and D=15 satisfies C=3D.\n\nSimilarly, in solution 5, A=8 and B=4 satisfies A=2B, and C=54 and D=18 satisfies C=3D.\n\nSo, all these solutions are valid mathematically.\n\nBut the problem mentions that each barber has a different number of customers.\n\nIn solution 4, A=16 and C=45, all different.\n\nIn solution 5, A=8, B=4, C=54, D=18, all different.\n\nSo, all five solutions are valid.\n\nBut perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing.\n\nWait, in solution 4, A=16 and C=45, which are different.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem implies that the barbers have different numbers of customers, meaning all four numbers must be distinct, which they are in all five solutions.\n\nSo, all five are valid.\n\nBut perhaps there's additional information I can use to select one solution over the others.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each barber has a different number of customers per day.\"\n\nSo, in all five solutions, all four numbers are different, so all are valid.\n\nUnless there's another condition I haven't considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the barbers are ordered in some way, but the problem just lists them as A, B, C, D, without specifying an order based on the number of customers.\n\nSo, perhaps any of these solutions could be correct.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects only one solution, so perhaps I need to look for another constraint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the barbers are ordered by the number of customers, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Barber A has twice as many customers as Barber B.\" and \"Barber C has three times more customers than Barber D.\"\n\nSo, based on these relationships, we've found multiple valid solutions.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the solution with the smallest possible D, which is D=3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a unique solution based on additional implicit constraints.\n\nBut based on the given information, there are five possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"three times more\" is being misinterpreted.\n\nEarlier, I took C = 3D, meaning C has three times the number of customers D has.\n\nBut maybe \"three times more\" means C = D + 3D = 4D.\n\nLet's consider that interpretation.\n\nSo, C = 4D.\n\nNow, revising the equations:\n\nA = 2B\n\nC = 4D\n\nA + B + C + D = 84\n\nSubstitute A and C:\n\n2B + B + 4D + D = 84\n\n3B + 5D = 84\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\n3B = 84 - 5D\n\nB = (84 - 5D)/3\n\nAgain, B must be an integer, so (84 - 5D) must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's try different integer values for D:\n\nD=0: B=28, but D can't be 0.\n\nD=3: B=(84 - 15)/3 = 69/3 = 23\n\nThen A=46, C=12\n\nCheck: 46 + 23 + 12 + 3 = 84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=6: B=(84 - 30)/3 = 54/3 = 18\n\nA=36, C=24\n\nTotal: 36 + 18 + 24 + 6 = 84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=9: B=(84 - 45)/3 = 39/3 = 13\n\nA=26, C=36\n\nTotal: 26 + 13 + 36 + 9 = 84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=12: B=(84 - 60)/3 = 24/3 = 8\n\nA=16, C=48\n\nTotal: 16 + 8 + 48 + 12 = 84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=15: B=(84 - 75)/3 = 9/3 = 3\n\nA=6, C=60\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 60 + 15 = 84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=18: B=(84 - 90)/3 = (-6)/3 = -2, not acceptable.\n\nSo, with C = 4D, there are five possible solutions:\n\n1. D=3, B=23, A=46, C=12\n\n2. D=6, B=18, A=36, C=24\n\n3. D=9, B=13, A=26, C=36\n\n4. D=12, B=8, A=16, C=48\n\n5. D=15, B=3, A=6, C=60\n\nAgain, multiple solutions.\n\nBut perhaps in this interpretation, C = 4D, there are five solutions, while in the previous interpretation, C = 3D, there were also multiple solutions.\n\nBut the problem likely intended one specific solution, so perhaps there's a standard interpretation of \"three times more.\"\n\nIn everyday language, \"three times more\" often means C = 4D, while \"three times as many\" would mean C = 3D.\n\nBut the problem says \"three times more,\" so perhaps C = 4D is the correct interpretation.\n\nIn that case, the five solutions are as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant C = 3D, in which case the earlier five solutions apply.\n\nBut to stick with the standard interpretation, C = 4D.\n\nSo, the possible solutions are:\n\n1. D=3, B=23, A=46, C=12\n\n2. D=6, B=18, A=36, C=24\n\n3. D=9, B=13, A=26, C=36\n\n4. D=12, B=8, A=16, C=48\n\n5. D=15, B=3, A=6, C=60\n\nNow, perhaps the problem expects the solution where C > A, or some other condition, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a unique solution based on additional constraints.\n\nWait, in the first interpretation (C=3D), the five solutions were:\n\n1. D=3, B=24, A=48, C=9\n\n2. D=6, B=20, A=40, C=18\n\n3. D=9, B=16, A=32, C=27\n\n4. D=15, B=8, A=16, C=45\n\n5. D=18, B=4, A=8, C=54\n\nIn the second interpretation (C=4D), the solutions are different.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects C = 3D, not C = 4D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a unique solution only under one interpretation.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"Barber C has three times more customers than Barber D.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nLet me assume C = 3D, and see if that leads to a consistent solution.\n\nSo, A = 2B\n\nC = 3D\n\nA + B + C + D = 84\n\nSubstitute A and C:\n\n2B + B + 3D + D = 84\n\n3B + 4D = 84\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB = (84 - 4D)/3\n\nWe need B to be an integer, so 84 - 4D must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me find D such that 84 - 4D is divisible by 3.\n\nTry D=3:\n\nB=(84 - 12)/3=72/3=24\n\nA=48, C=9\n\nTotal:48+24+9+3=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=6:\n\nB=(84-24)/3=60/3=20\n\nA=40, C=18\n\nTotal:40+20+18+6=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=9:\n\nB=(84-36)/3=48/3=16\n\nA=32, C=27\n\nTotal:32+16+27+9=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=12:\n\nB=(84-48)/3=36/3=12\n\nBut then B=D=12, which violates the condition that each barber has a different number of customers.\n\nSo, D cannot be 12.\n\nD=15:\n\nB=(84-60)/3=24/3=8\n\nA=16, C=45\n\nTotal:16+8+45+15=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=18:\n\nB=(84-72)/3=12/3=4\n\nA=8, C=54\n\nTotal:8+4+54+18=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=21:\n\nB=(84-84)/3=0/3=0\n\nB=0 not acceptable.\n\nSo, possible solutions with C=3D are:\n\n1. D=3, B=24, A=48, C=9\n\n2. D=6, B=20, A=40, C=18\n\n3. D=9, B=16, A=32, C=27\n\n4. D=15, B=8, A=16, C=45\n\n5. D=18, B=4, A=8, C=54\n\nNow, in these solutions, in solution 4 and 5, A and B values repeat.\n\nIn solution 4: A=16, B=8\n\nIn solution 5: A=8, B=4\n\nBut in solution 4, C=45 and D=15, which are different.\n\nSo, all are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution where C > A, or some other condition.\n\nBut without additional constraints, all these solutions are mathematically valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution with the smallest possible D, which is D=3.\n\nIn that case:\n\nD=3, B=24, A=48, C=9\n\nBut this seems unusual because C=9 is less than B=24 and much less than A=48, which might be acceptable, but perhaps not what was intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the relationships.\n\nLet me consider that \"three times more\" might mean C = 3D + D = 4D.\n\nSo, C = 4D.\n\nLet me solve it again with C=4D.\n\nA = 2B\n\nC = 4D\n\nA + B + C + D = 84\n\nSubstitute A and C:\n\n2B + B + 4D + D = 84\n\n3B + 5D = 84\n\nSolve for B:\n\nB = (84 - 5D)/3\n\nNeed B to be an integer, so 84 - 5D must be divisible by 3.\n\nTry D=3:\n\nB=(84-15)/3=69/3=23\n\nA=46, C=12\n\nTotal:46+23+12+3=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=6:\n\nB=(84-30)/3=54/3=18\n\nA=36, C=24\n\nTotal:36+18+24+6=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=9:\n\nB=(84-45)/3=39/3=13\n\nA=26, C=36\n\nTotal:26+13+36+9=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=12:\n\nB=(84-60)/3=24/3=8\n\nA=16, C=48\n\nTotal:16+8+48+12=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=15:\n\nB=(84-75)/3=9/3=3\n\nA=6, C=60\n\nTotal:6+3+60+15=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=18:\n\nB=(84-90)/3=-6/3=-2, not acceptable.\n\nSo, possible solutions with C=4D are:\n\n1. D=3, B=23, A=46, C=12\n\n2. D=6, B=18, A=36, C=24\n\n3. D=9, B=13, A=26, C=36\n\n4. D=12, B=8, A=16, C=48\n\n5. D=15, B=3, A=6, C=60\n\nAgain, multiple solutions.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects C=3D, leading to the first set of solutions, or C=4D, leading to the second set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"three times more\" is meant to be C=3D, and my second interpretation is incorrect.\n\nIn standard mathematical terms, \"three times more\" often means C=4D, but in everyday language, it can be ambiguous.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects C=3D, leading to the first set of solutions.\n\nIn that case, the possible solutions are:\n\n1. D=3, B=24, A=48, C=9\n\n2. D=6, B=20, A=40, C=18\n\n3. D=9, B=16, A=32, C=27\n\n4. D=15, B=8, A=16, C=45\n\n5. D=18, B=4, A=8, C=54\n\nWait, in solution 4, A=16 and B=8, which is fine, but A should be twice B, which it is.\n\nSimilarly, in solution 5, A=8 and B=4, again satisfying A=2B.\n\nSo, all these are valid.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects the solution where C is greater than A, or some other condition.\n\nBut without additional constraints, it's difficult to determine which one is the intended solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on the condition that all barbers have different numbers of customers.\n\nBut in all the solutions above, all four numbers are different, so that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution where the numbers are as spread out as possible, or perhaps where the numbers are as small as possible.\n\nBut without clear instructions, it's hard to decide.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should assume C=3D and pick the first solution where D=3, B=24, A=48, C=9.\n\nBut this seems unusual because C=9 is less than B=24 and A=48, which might not make sense in a real-world scenario, but mathematically it's valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a unique solution only under one interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering D=15 and D=18 in the first interpretation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn the first interpretation (C=3D):\n\nFor D=15:\n\nB=(84-60)/3=24/3=8\n\nA=16, C=45\n\nTotal:16+8+45+15=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=18:\n\nB=(84-72)/3=12/3=4\n\nA=8, C=54\n\nTotal:8+4+54+18=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nSo, these are valid.\n\nSimilarly, in the second interpretation (C=4D):\n\nD=15:\n\nB=(84-75)/3=9/3=3\n\nA=6, C=60\n\nTotal:6+3+60+15=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nSo, again, multiple solutions.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the solution with the smallest D, which is D=3.\n\nIn the first interpretation (C=3D):\n\nD=3, B=24, A=48, C=9\n\nIn the second interpretation (C=4D):\n\nD=3, B=23, A=46, C=12\n\nSo, two possible solutions for D=3:\n\n1. D=3, B=24, A=48, C=9 (if C=3D)\n\n2. D=3, B=23, A=46, C=12 (if C=4D)\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects C=3D, leading to the first solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solve this problem.\n\nLet me consider assigning variables differently.\n\nLet me assume D has X customers.\n\nThen, C has 3X customers (assuming C=3D).\n\nB has Y customers.\n\nA has 2Y customers.\n\nNow, A + B + C + D = 84\n\n2Y + Y + 3X + X = 84\n\n3Y + 4X = 84\n\nNow, solve for Y:\n\n3Y = 84 - 4X\n\nY = (84 - 4X)/3\n\nNeed Y to be an integer, so 84 - 4X must be divisible by 3.\n\nFind X such that 84 - 4X is divisible by 3.\n\nTry X=3:\n\nY=(84-12)/3=72/3=24\n\nSo, D=3, C=9, B=24, A=48\n\nX=6:\n\nY=(84-24)/3=60/3=20\n\nD=6, C=18, B=20, A=40\n\nWait, C=18, B=20, which is acceptable.\n\nX=9:\n\nY=(84-36)/3=48/3=16\n\nD=9, C=27, B=16, A=32\n\nX=12:\n\nY=(84-48)/3=36/3=12\n\nBut then B=12, D=12, which violates the distinct condition.\n\nX=15:\n\nY=(84-60)/3=24/3=8\n\nD=15, C=45, B=8, A=16\n\nX=18:\n\nY=(84-72)/3=12/3=4\n\nD=18, C=54, B=4, A=8\n\nX=21:\n\nY=(84-84)/3=0/3=0, not acceptable.\n\nSo, possible solutions with C=3D are:\n\n1. D=3, B=24, A=48, C=9\n\n2. D=6, B=20, A=40, C=18\n\n3. D=9, B=16, A=32, C=27\n\n4. D=15, B=8, A=16, C=45\n\n5. D=18, B=4, A=8, C=54\n\nAgain, multiple solutions.\n\nAlternatively, if C=4D, then:\n\nX=D\n\nC=4D\n\nB=Y\n\nA=2Y\n\nThen, A + B + C + D = 84\n\n2Y + Y + 4D + D = 84\n\n3Y + 5D = 84\n\nSolve for Y:\n\nY = (84 - 5D)/3\n\nNeed Y to be an integer, so 84 - 5D must be divisible by 3.\n\nTry D=3:\n\nY=(84-15)/3=69/3=23\n\nA=46, C=12\n\nTotal:46+23+12+3=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=6:\n\nY=(84-30)/3=54/3=18\n\nA=36, C=24\n\nTotal:36+18+24+6=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=9:\n\nY=(84-45)/3=39/3=13\n\nA=26, C=36\n\nTotal:26+13+36+9=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=12:\n\nY=(84-60)/3=24/3=8\n\nA=16, C=48\n\nTotal:16+8+48+12=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=15:\n\nY=(84-75)/3=9/3=3\n\nA=6, C=60\n\nTotal:6+3+60+15=84\n\nAll different: yes.\n\nD=18:\n\nY=(84-90)/3=-6/3=-2, not acceptable.\n\nSo, five possible solutions with C=4D.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects C=3D, leading to the first set of solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on additional constraints not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has multiple solutions, and all are acceptable.\n\nIn that case, the barbers' customers could be any of the combinations listed above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose the solution where C > A, but that's not the case in all solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution where C is greater than D, which is always true since C=3D or C=4D, both greater than D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the relationships.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have a unique solution, and I've made a mistake in interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have multiple solutions, and the user is expected to find all of them.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer should include all possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution with the smallest possible D, which is D=3.\n\nIn that case, with C=3D, the solution is D=3, B=24, A=48, C=9.\n\nAlternatively, with C=4D, it's D=3, B=23, A=46, C=12.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects C=3D, leading to A=48, B=24, C=9, D=3.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because C=9 is less than B=24 and A=48, which might not make sense in a real-world scenario, but mathematically it's valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake or is ambiguous.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that there are multiple possible solutions based on the interpretation of \"three times more.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects C=3D, and the solution is A=48, B=24, C=9, D=3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem should have specified C=3D explicitly to avoid confusion.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that Barber A has 48 customers, Barber B has 24 customers, Barber C has 9 customers, and Barber D has 3 customers.\n\nAlternatively, if C=4D, then Barber A has 46 customers, Barber B has 23 customers, Barber C has 12 customers, and Barber D has 3 customers.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps both solutions are acceptable, but the problem likely expects C=3D, leading to A=48, B=24, C=9, D=3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem should be rephrased to avoid ambiguity.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that Barber A has 48 customers, Barber B has 24 customers, Barber C has 9 customers, and Barber D has 3 customers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A=48, B=24, C=9, D=3} \\]"
