        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Bash script that accomplishes the task of finding all files within a directory tree that are larger than a specified size and outputs their paths.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided\nif [ \"$#\" -ne 2 ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: $0 <directory> <size_in_bytes>\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\ndirectory=\"$1\"\nsize=\"$2\"\n\n# Check if the provided directory exists\nif [ ! -d \"$directory\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: Directory '$directory' does not exist.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Find files larger than the specified size and output their paths\nfind \"$directory\" -type f -size +\"$size\"c -print\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Argument Check**: The script first checks if exactly two arguments are provided. The first argument should be the directory to search in, and the second should be the minimum file size in bytes.\n\n2. **Directory Existence Check**: It verifies if the provided directory exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits.\n\n3. **Finding Files**: It uses the `find` command to search for files (`-type f`) larger than the specified size (`-size +\"$size\"c`). The `-print` option outputs the paths of these files.\n\n### Usage:\n\nSave the script to a file, for example, `find_large_files.sh`, give it execute permissions using `chmod +x find_large_files.sh`, and run it with the directory and size as arguments:\n\n```bash\n./find_large_files.sh /path/to/directory 1000000\n```\n\nThis will find all files larger than 1,000,000 bytes (1 MB) in the specified directory and its subdirectories.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- The `find` command's `-size` option with the `c` suffix specifies the size in bytes.\n\n- Ensure that the directory path is correctly specified and that the script has the necessary permissions to read the directory and its contents.\n\n- Adjust the size parameter as needed based on your requirements."
