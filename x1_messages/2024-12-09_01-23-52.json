        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving Town A at 8:00 AM going towards Town B at 60 miles per hour, and another leaving Town B at 9:00 AM going towards Town A at 80 miles per hour. The distance between the two towns is 420 miles. I need to find out when these two trains will meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how far the first train has traveled by the time the second train starts at 9:00 AM. The first train leaves at 8:00 AM and travels at 60 miles per hour, so by 9:00 AM, it would have traveled for 1 hour. Distance equals speed times time, so that's 60 miles per hour times 1 hour, which is 60 miles.\n\nSo, by 9:00 AM, the first train is 60 miles away from Town A, heading towards Town B. The second train starts from Town B at 9:00 AM, heading towards Town A at 80 miles per hour. The total distance between the two towns is 420 miles, but since the first train has already covered 60 miles, the remaining distance between the two trains at 9:00 AM is 420 miles minus 60 miles, which is 360 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up. The first train is going at 60 mph and the second at 80 mph, so together they are closing the gap at a rate of 60 + 80 = 140 miles per hour.\n\nTo find out how long it will take for them to meet, I can divide the remaining distance by their combined speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed, which is 360 miles divided by 140 miles per hour. Let me calculate that: 360 divided by 140 is 2.5714 hours. That's approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes.\n\nWait, let me be more precise. 360 divided by 140 is exactly 2.5714 hours. To convert the decimal part to minutes, I can take 0.5714 hours times 60 minutes per hour, which is approximately 34.2857 minutes. So, roughly 2 hours and 34 minutes.\n\nNow, since the second train starts at 9:00 AM, I need to add these 2 hours and 34 minutes to that time to find out when they meet. 9:00 AM plus 2 hours is 11:00 AM, and adding 34 minutes brings us to 11:34 AM.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the first train travels for 1 hour before the second train starts, covering 60 miles. Remaining distance is 420 - 60 = 360 miles.\n\nCombined speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nTime to cover 360 miles at 140 mph is 360 / 140 = 2.5714 hours.\n\nConverting 0.5714 hours to minutes: 0.5714 * 60 \u2248 34.2857 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes after 9:00 AM, which is indeed 11:34 AM.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11:34\\ \\text{AM}} \\]"
