        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that in a room full of people, 40% have blue eyes, 30% have green eyes, and the remaining people have brown eyes. And it tells me that there are 60 people with blue eyes, and I need to find out how many people are in the room in total.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I know that 40% of the total number of people have blue eyes, and that counts to 60 people. So, if I let the total number of people in the room be T, then 40% of T is equal to 60.\n\nIn mathematical terms, that's:\n\n40% of T = 60\n\nOr, 0.40 * T = 60\n\nNow, to find T, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.40.\n\nSo, T = 60 / 0.40\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n60 divided by 0.40 is the same as 60 divided by 2/5, which is 60 * (5/2) = 150.\n\nSo, the total number of people in the room is 150.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's see if the other percentages make sense with this total.\n\nIt says 30% have green eyes. So, 30% of 150 is 0.30 * 150 = 45 people with green eyes.\n\nAnd the remaining people have brown eyes. Since 40% have blue and 30% have green, that's 70% accounted for. So, 100% - 70% = 30% have brown eyes.\n\n30% of 150 is 0.30 * 150 = 45 people with brown eyes.\n\nSo, adding them up: 60 (blue) + 45 (green) + 45 (brown) = 150, which matches the total.\n\nLooks like my calculation is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
