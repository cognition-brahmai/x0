        "content": "So John can paint a room by himself in 5 hours, and Jane can do it in 3 hours. We want to know how long it would take for them to paint the room together. Hmm, this seems like a problem about working together and combining rates.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how much of the room each person can paint per hour. That way, I can see how much they can do together in one hour and then find out how long it would take them to finish the whole room.\n\nSo, John takes 5 hours to paint the entire room. That means in one hour, he paints 1/5 of the room. Similarly, Jane takes 3 hours, so in one hour, she paints 1/3 of the room.\n\nNow, if they work together, their painting rates should add up. So, in one hour, together they can paint 1/5 + 1/3 of the room.\n\nTo add those fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 3 is 15. So, 1/5 is equal to 3/15, and 1/3 is equal to 5/15. Adding them up, they can paint 3/15 + 5/15 = 8/15 of the room in one hour.\n\nSo, together, they paint 8/15 of the room per hour. To find out how long it takes to paint the whole room, I need to divide the entire room (which is 1) by their combined rate (which is 8/15 per hour). So, time = 1 / (8/15) = 1 * (15/8) = 15/8 hours.\n\n15/8 hours is the same as 1 hour and 7.5 minutes, right? Because 15 divided by 8 is 1.875, and 0.875 of an hour is 0.875 * 60 minutes, which is 52.5 minutes. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 15 divided by 8 is 1.875, and 0.875 * 60 is indeed 52.5 minutes. So, together, they can paint the room in 1 hour and 52.5 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, John's rate: 1/5 of the room per hour.\n\nJane's rate: 1/3 of the room per hour.\n\nCombined rate: 1/5 + 1/3 = 3/15 + 5/15 = 8/15 of the room per hour.\n\nTime to paint the room: 1 / (8/15) = 15/8 hours.\n\n15/8 hours is 1.875 hours.\n\nConvert 0.875 hours to minutes: 0.875 * 60 = 52.5 minutes.\n\nSo, yes, together they can paint the room in 1 hour and 52.5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire work done. If John can paint the room in 5 hours, his painting rate is 1 room per 5 hours, or 0.2 rooms per hour. Jane's rate is 1 room per 3 hours, or approximately 0.333 rooms per hour. Together, they paint 0.2 + 0.333 = 0.533 rooms per hour. Then, time to paint one room is 1 / 0.533 hours, which is approximately 1.875 hours, matching my previous calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the harmonic mean of their individual times, but I think adding their rates is more straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 15/8 hours, or 1 hour and 52.5 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{8} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
