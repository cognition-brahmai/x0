        "content": "The term for the boundary around a black hole beyond which no light or other radiation can escape is called the \"Event Horizon.\" So, the correct answer is A. Event Horizon.\n\nTo provide a bit more detail, the event horizon is a theoretical boundary in spacetime around a black hole from which nothing can escape, not even light. This is because the gravitational pull becomes so strong that the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. The concept was first introduced by the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, who solved Einstein's field equations for general relativity for the case of a point mass, leading to what is now known as the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius, option C, is related to the event horizon as it defines the radius at which the event horizon forms for a non-rotating black hole. For any object with mass, the Schwarzschild radius is the size at which its escape velocity equals the speed of light. However, the term \"event horizon\" specifically refers to this boundary in the context of black holes.\n\nOption B, \"Absolute Horizon,\" isn't a standard term in astronomy. It might be a misnomer or a confusion with other horizons in more complex black hole solutions, such as the Cauchy horizon in rotating or charged black holes.\n\nOption D, \"Gravitational Singularity,\" refers to the point within a black hole where the density is thought to be infinite, and the known laws of physics break down. This is distinct from the event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer.\n\nSo, in summary, the event horizon is the critical boundary around a black hole that marks the point of no return for any matter or radiation."
