        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles in a bag. I need to draw marbles without looking until I have drawn 5 marbles of the same color. The question is asking for the maximum number of marbles I could draw before reaching this goal.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to draw marbles one by one without looking, which means each draw is random and I don't know the color until I draw it. The goal is to have 5 marbles of the same color. I need to find out the maximum number of draws I might need to reach this goal.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the worst-case scenario is. The worst-case scenario would be drawing marbles in such a way that I delay getting 5 of the same color as much as possible.\n\nLet's think about it. If I draw 4 red marbles and 4 blue marbles, I haven't yet reached 5 of the same color. So, that's 8 marbles drawn, and I still don't have 5 of one color.\n\nIf I draw one more marble, that would be the 9th marble. This marble must be either red or blue. If it's red, then I have 5 red marbles, and if it's blue, I have 5 blue marbles. So, in this case, the maximum number of draws would be 9.\n\nWait a minute, but there are 50 marbles of each color. Does the total number of marbles affect the maximum number of draws needed?\n\nActually, no. The maximum number of draws needed is determined by the worst-case scenario, which is drawing as many marbles as possible without reaching 5 of the same color, and then drawing one more.\n\nSo, in the worst case, I could draw 4 red and 4 blue marbles, totaling 8 marbles, without having 5 of the same color. The next marble, the 9th one, would necessarily be either red or blue, giving me 5 of one color.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of marbles I could draw before reaching the goal is 9.\n\nBut let's double-check this. Suppose I draw 4 red, then 4 blue, that's 8 marbles, and the 9th marble must be either red or blue, making it 5 of that color.\n\nIs there a way to draw more than 9 marbles without having 5 of the same color? Let's see.\n\nIf I try to draw a 10th marble, but wait, by the time I've drawn 9 marbles, I already have 5 of one color. So, drawing a 10th marble is unnecessary because the goal is already achieved by the 9th draw.\n\nHence, the maximum number of marbles I could draw before reaching the goal is 9.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
