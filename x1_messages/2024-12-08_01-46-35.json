        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have four rectangular fields that all have the same area. The lengths of these fields are in the ratio 1:2:3:4. We need to find the ratio of their widths.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nSince all four fields have the same area, we can set up equations for each field's area and set them equal to each other.\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the four fields as \\( l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4 \\), and their corresponding widths as \\( w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4 \\). According to the problem, the lengths are in the ratio 1:2:3:4. This means:\n\n\\[\nl_1 : l_2 : l_3 : l_4 = 1 : 2 : 3 : 4\n\\]\n\nWe can express each length in terms of a common variable to make calculations easier. Let's let the common ratio be \\( k \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nl_1 = k, \\quad l_2 = 2k, \\quad l_3 = 3k, \\quad l_4 = 4k\n\\]\n\nNow, since all fields have the same area, we can set up the following equations:\n\n\\[\nl_1 \\times w_1 = l_2 \\times w_2 = l_3 \\times w_3 = l_4 \\times w_4\n\\]\n\nLet's denote this common area as \\( A \\). So:\n\n\\[\nk \\times w_1 = 2k \\times w_2 = 3k \\times w_3 = 4k \\times w_4 = A\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio \\( w_1 : w_2 : w_3 : w_4 \\). To do this, we can solve each equation for the widths in terms of \\( A \\) and \\( k \\).\n\nStarting with the first field:\n\n\\[\nw_1 = \\frac{A}{k}\n\\]\n\nFor the second field:\n\n\\[\nw_2 = \\frac{A}{2k}\n\\]\n\nFor the third field:\n\n\\[\nw_3 = \\frac{A}{3k}\n\\]\n\nAnd for the fourth field:\n\n\\[\nw_4 = \\frac{A}{4k}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the ratio of the widths, we can write:\n\n\\[\nw_1 : w_2 : w_3 : w_4 = \\frac{A}{k} : \\frac{A}{2k} : \\frac{A}{3k} : \\frac{A}{4k}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing each term by \\( \\frac{A}{k} \\):\n\n\\[\n1 : \\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{1}{3} : \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nTo make this ratio easier to understand, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 12. So, we can multiply each term by 12 to eliminate the denominators:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 1 : 12 \\times \\frac{1}{2} : 12 \\times \\frac{1}{3} : 12 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 12 : 6 : 4 : 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the widths is:\n\n\\[\n12 : 6 : 4 : 3\n\\]\n\nWe can also write this in its simplest form by dividing each term by the greatest common divisor of the numbers, which is 1 in this case. So, the ratio remains:\n\n\\[\n12 : 6 : 4 : 3\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express it in terms of the smallest width, we can divide each term by 3:\n\n\\[\n4 : 2 : \\frac{4}{3} : 1\n\\]\n\nBut the first form, \\( 12 : 6 : 4 : 3 \\), is clearer and avoids fractions.\n\nSo, the ratio of the widths of the four fields is \\( 12 : 6 : 4 : 3 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12 : 6 : 4 : 3} \\]"
