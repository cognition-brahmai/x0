Here's a possible script:\n\n[The show opens with Graham Norton welcoming the audience and introducing Meryl Streep.]\n\nGraham Norton: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the extraordinary Meryl Streep!\n\n[Audience applauds as Meryl Streep walks onto the stage and takes a seat beside Graham Norton.]\n\nGraham Norton: Meryl, it's such an honor to have you here tonight.\n\nMeryl Streep: Thank you, Graham. It's great to be here.\n\nGraham Norton: You've had an incredible career spanning over four decades, with countless iconic roles. It must be tough to pick favorites, but I'm curious\u2014what are some of your all-time favorite movie roles?\n\nMeryl Streep: Well, Graham, it is difficult to choose, but there are a few that stand out for different reasons. One that comes to mind is \"Sophie's Choice.\" That was my breakthrough role, and it was a turning point in my career. Playing Sophie, a Polish Holocaust survivor, was a profound experience. The character's emotional depth and the weight of her past were incredibly challenging, but also very rewarding.\n\nGraham Norton: Absolutely, \"Sophie's Choice\" is a masterpiece. Another role that springs to mind is your portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in \"The Iron Lady.\" How did you prepare for that role, and what was it like delving into the mind of such a prominent historical figure?\n\nMeryl Streep: Preparing for Margaret Thatcher was a fascinating process. I spent a lot of time watching archival footage, reading biographies, and even meeting with people who knew her. One of the most interesting aspects was trying to capture her mannerisms, her voice, and her demeanor. It was important to me to do justice to the complexity of her character and her impact on British politics.\n\nGraham Norton: Your performance was widely acclaimed, and you even won an Academy Award for it. Speaking of awards, you have three Oscars under your belt, and you've been nominated multiple times. Is there a particular nomination or win that stands out for you?\n\nMeryl Streep: Each nomination and win has been special in its own way, but perhaps the first one for \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" holds a\u7279\u522b place because it was such a significant moment in my career. It marked a turning point and opened many doors for me.\n\nGraham Norton: Indeed, and your role in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" was groundbreaking for exploring themes of parenting and gender roles. Shifting gears a bit, you've also tackled more lighthearted roles, like in \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" How do you approach such different genres and characters?\n\nMeryl Streep: I believe that every role, whether dramatic or comedic, requires the same level of commitment and research. With \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" playing Miranda Priestly was a lot of fun. It was a chance to dive into the world of high fashion and play a character who was both intimidating and fascinating. It was a departure from some of my earlier roles, but I enjoyed the challenge.\n\nGraham Norton: You certainly brought Miranda Priestly to life in a way that's become iconic. Moving on, you've worked with some of the greatest directors in the industry, like Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, and Clint Eastwood. Is there a particular collaboration that stands out as especially memorable?\n\nMeryl Streep: Collaborating with Steven Spielberg on \"Sophie's Choice\" was undoubtedly memorable. His vision and attention to detail are unparalleled. Another standout collaboration was with Woody Allen on multiple films. Working with Woody is always a delight; his wit and creativity know no bounds.\n\nGraham Norton: It's amazing how you've managed to balance serious dramas with comedic roles and work with such a diverse range of directors. Now, looking back at your career, is there a role you wish you had taken or a project you regret passing on?\n\nMeryl Streep: Oh, Graham, that's a tricky question. I think every actor looks back and wonders about roles they didn't pursue. Perhaps \"Taxi Driver\" comes to mind; I was considered for the role of Iris, which eventually went to Jodie Foster. But in hindsight, I'm grateful for the roles I did take and the experiences they brought.\n\nGraham Norton: It's fascinating to hear about those behind-the-scenes decisions. Finally, what can you tease about your future projects? Any exciting roles or films in the pipeline that you can share with us?\n\nMeryl Streep: Well, I always have a few projects in the works, but I'm not at liberty to discuss them just yet. Suffice it to say, I'm excited about the directions I'm heading in and the characters I'll be portraying next.\n\nGraham Norton: We can't wait to see what you have in store for us, Meryl. Thank you so much for joining us tonight and sharing your insights.\n\nMeryl Streep: Thank you, Graham. It's been a pleasure.\n\n[The audience applauds as the interview comes to a close.]\n\n[The show transitions to a commercial break.]\n\n[End of Script]"
