        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I have a game where I have a 1 in 6 chance of winning each time I play. I want to know the odds that I'll win at least once if I play 6 times. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, probability can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. The key here is understanding what \"at least once\" means. It means winning one time, or two times, or up to all six times. Calculating that directly might be complicated because there are many possible ways to win at least once.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a smarter way to think about this. Instead of calculating the probability of winning at least once directly, perhaps I can calculate the probability of not winning at all in six plays and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the probability of winning at least once.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nProbability of winning at least once = 1 - Probability of not winning at all in six plays.\n\nThat makes sense. Now, what's the probability of not winning a single time in six plays?\n\nEach play is independent, and the probability of not winning a single play is 5/6 (since the probability of winning is 1/6).\n\nSo, for six independent plays, the probability of not winning any of them should be (5/6)^6.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nRaising that to the sixth power: 0.8333^6.\n\nI'll need a calculator for this.\n\nLet me get my phone.\n\nOkay, 0.8333 to the power of 6 is approximately 0.3349.\n\nSo, the probability of not winning at all in six plays is about 0.3349, or 33.49%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning at least once is 1 - 0.3349 = 0.6651, or 66.51%.\n\nWait, that seems pretty high. Is that make sense?\n\nLet me think again. If I have a 1 in 6 chance of winning each time, and I play six times, it seems like I should have a good chance of winning at least once.\n\nBut is 66.51% the right answer?\n\nLet me try to verify this another way.\n\nMaybe I can calculate the probability of winning exactly once, exactly twice, up to exactly six times, and add them all up.\n\nBut that sounds complicated. There must be a formula for this.\n\nI think this is a case of the binomial probability formula.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P(k) is the probability of winning exactly k times\n\n- C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time\n\n- p is the probability of winning a single game (1/6)\n\n- n is the number of plays (6)\n\n- k is the number of wins (from 1 to 6)\n\nTo find the probability of winning at least once, I need to sum P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) + P(6).\n\nAlternatively, as I thought earlier, it's 1 - P(0).\n\nI think using 1 - P(0) is simpler.\n\nLet me calculate P(0), which is the probability of not winning any of the six plays.\n\nP(0) = C(6,0) * (1/6)^0 * (5/6)^6\n\nC(6,0) is 1, and any number to the power of 0 is 1, so P(0) = 1 * 1 * (5/6)^6.\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated earlier: (5/6)^6 \u2248 0.3349.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.3349 = 0.6651, or 66.51%.\n\nAlright, that seems consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can calculate P(1) and see if it makes sense.\n\nP(1) = C(6,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^5\n\nC(6,1) is 6, (1/6)^1 is 1/6, and (5/6)^5 is approximately 0.4019.\n\nSo, P(1) = 6 * (1/6) * 0.4019 \u2248 6 * 0.167 * 0.4019 \u2248 0.4019.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, 6 * (1/6) is 1, and 1 * 0.4019 is 0.4019.\n\nSo, P(1) \u2248 0.4019.\n\nSimilarly, P(2) = C(6,2) * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^4\n\nC(6,2) is 15, (1/6)^2 is 1/36 \u2248 0.0278, (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.4823.\n\nSo, P(2) = 15 * 0.0278 * 0.4823 \u2248 15 * 0.0134 \u2248 0.201.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) = C(6,3) * (1/6)^3 * (5/6)^3\n\nC(6,3) is 20, (1/6)^3 is 1/216 \u2248 0.00463, (5/6)^3 \u2248 0.5787.\n\nSo, P(3) = 20 * 0.00463 * 0.5787 \u2248 20 * 0.00268 \u2248 0.0536.\n\nP(4) = C(6,4) * (1/6)^4 * (5/6)^2\n\nC(6,4) is 15, (1/6)^4 is 1/1296 \u2248 0.00077, (5/6)^2 \u2248 0.6944.\n\nSo, P(4) = 15 * 0.00077 * 0.6944 \u2248 15 * 0.000535 \u2248 0.00802.\n\nP(5) = C(6,5) * (1/6)^5 * (5/6)^1\n\nC(6,5) is 6, (1/6)^5 is 1/7776 \u2248 0.000129, (5/6)^1 \u2248 0.8333.\n\nSo, P(5) = 6 * 0.000129 * 0.8333 \u2248 6 * 0.000108 \u2248 0.000648.\n\nP(6) = C(6,6) * (1/6)^6 * (5/6)^0\n\nC(6,6) is 1, (1/6)^6 is 1/46656 \u2248 0.0000214, (5/6)^0 = 1.\n\nSo, P(6) = 1 * 0.0000214 * 1 \u2248 0.0000214.\n\nNow, let's add all these up:\n\nP(1) \u2248 0.4019\n\nP(2) \u2248 0.201\n\nP(3) \u2248 0.0536\n\nP(4) \u2248 0.00802\n\nP(5) \u2248 0.000648\n\nP(6) \u2248 0.0000214\n\nTotal \u2248 0.4019 + 0.201 = 0.6029\n\nPlus 0.0536 = 0.6565\n\nPlus 0.00802 = 0.66452\n\nPlus 0.000648 = 0.665168\n\nPlus 0.0000214 = 0.6651894\n\nSo, approximately 0.6652, or 66.52%.\n\nThat's very close to what I got earlier with 1 - P(0) = 1 - 0.3349 = 0.6651.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning at least once in six plays is about 66.5%.\n\nBut the question asked for \"odds.\" Odds are different from probability. Odds are expressed as the ratio of the probability of an event happening to the probability of it not happening.\n\nSo, if the probability of winning at least once is 0.6651, then the probability of not winning at all is 1 - 0.6651 = 0.3349.\n\nTherefore, the odds of winning at least once are 0.6651 : 0.3349.\n\nTo express this in simplest form, I can divide both parts by 0.3349.\n\nSo, 0.6651 / 0.3349 \u2248 1.984, and 0.3349 / 0.3349 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the odds are approximately 1.984 : 1.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as about 2 : 1.\n\nSo, the odds are roughly 2 to 1 in favor of winning at least once in six plays.\n\nWait, but let's be more precise.\n\nLet me calculate it exactly.\n\nOdds in favor = Probability of winning at least once / Probability of not winning at all.\n\nWhich is (1 - (5/6)^6) / (5/6)^6.\n\nThat is, (1 - 0.3349) / 0.3349 = 0.6651 / 0.3349 \u2248 1.984.\n\nSo, approximately 1.984 : 1.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as about 2 : 1.\n\nSo, for every 1 time I don't win at all, I win at least once about 2 times.\n\nThat makes sense, given the probability is around 66.5%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions.\n\n(1 - (5/6)^6) / (5/6)^6 = (1 - (5^6)/(6^6)) / (5^6)/(6^6)) = (6^6 - 5^6)/5^6 = (46656 - 15625)/15625 = 31031/15625.\n\nSo, the exact odds are 31031 : 15625.\n\nSimplifying that fraction:\n\nLet's see, both numbers are divisible by... 31031 divided by 15625 is 1.984, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as 31031 : 15625, or approximate it to 2 : 1.\n\nFor practical purposes, saying the odds are about 2 to 1 in favor of winning at least once in six plays seems reasonable.\n\nBut to be precise, it's approximately 1.984 to 1.\n\nAlternatively, I can express odds in other ways, like \"chances.\"\n\nBut I think odds are typically expressed as the ratio of the probability of success to the probability of failure.\n\nSo, in this case, it's about 1.984 : 1 in favor of winning at least once.\n\nAlternatively, in betting terms, it might be expressed as odds against losing, or something like that.\n\nBut since this is a probability question, I think expressing it as approximately 2 to 1 is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the odds of winning at least once in six plays are about 2 to 1.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is about 66.5%.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Probability of winning at least once: approximately 66.5%\n\n- Odds: approximately 2 to 1 in favor.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{approximately } 66.5\\% \\text{ probability or about } 2 \\text{ to } 1 \\text{ odds in favor}} \\]"
