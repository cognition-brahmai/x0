        "content": "So there are four books on a shelf: two novels and two textbooks. I need to find out the probability of picking a novel at random. Okay, probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking a novel. There are two novels, so the number of favorable outcomes is 2. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of books, which is 4.\n\nSo, probability of picking a novel = number of novels / total number of books = 2 / 4 = 0.5.\n\nWait, but probabilities are usually expressed as fractions or percentages. So, 0.5 as a fraction is 1/2, and as a percentage, that's 50%.\n\nLet me double-check. There are four books: two novels and two textbooks. If I pick one at random, there are four equally likely possibilities. Two of those possibilities are novels, so the probability should indeed be 2 out of 4, which is 1/2 or 50%.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using combinations or something. Well, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here since we're just picking one book.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one novel from two novels is C(2,1) = 2.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any one book from four books is C(4,1) = 4.\n\nSo, probability = C(2,1) / C(4,1) = 2 / 4 = 1/2.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. There are two novels out of four books. So, (2/4)*100% = 50%.\n\nOr, thinking in decimals: 2 divided by 4 is 0.5, which is the same as 50%.\n\nWait, but the question asks to show my reasoning, so maybe I should stick with the fraction form.\n\nAlso, probabilities can be expressed as fractions, decimals, or percentages, but fractions are often the most precise and simplest.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2.\n\nLet me see if there's any other angle to this. Is there any chance that the books are arranged in a certain way or that picking one book affects the probability of picking another? Wait, no, the question is about picking one book at random, so there's no arrangement or sequential picking involved.\n\nAlso, all books are equally likely to be picked unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention any bias in picking, so I can assume that each book has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nTherefore, my answer should be straightforward: 1/2.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I can consider the probability of picking a textbook as well. If there are two textbooks out of four, the probability of picking a textbook would be 2/4, which is also 1/2. So, the probabilities add up to 1, which makes sense because either I pick a novel or a textbook.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if there were different numbers of novels and textbooks, I would adjust the numerator accordingly. For example, if there were three novels and one textbook, the probability of picking a novel would be 3/4, and picking a textbook would be 1/4.\n\nBut in this case, it's two and two, so it's evenly split.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
