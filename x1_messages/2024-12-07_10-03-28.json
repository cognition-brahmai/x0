        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about marbles in a bag. It says that there are 3 red marbles for every 5 blue marbles, and the total number of marbles is 24. I need to find out how many of them are red.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ratio given. The ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:5. That means for every 3 red marbles, there are 5 blue marbles. So, the total number of marbles in one complete set of this ratio is 3 + 5 = 8 marbles.\n\nNow, the total number of marbles is 24. I need to find out how many sets of 8 marbles are there in 24. I can do that by dividing 24 by 8, which is 24 \u00f7 8 = 3. So, there are 3 sets of the ratio in the bag.\n\nSince each set has 3 red marbles, the total number of red marbles would be 3 sets \u00d7 3 red marbles per set = 9 red marbles.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. If there are 3 sets, and each set has 5 blue marbles, then the total number of blue marbles would be 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 blue marbles. Adding the red marbles, 9 red + 15 blue = 24 marbles, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, my answer is 9 red marbles.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions or equations.\n\nLet\u2019s try that. Let\u2019s denote the number of red marbles as R and the number of blue marbles as B. According to the problem, R/B = 3/5, and R + B = 24.\n\nFrom the ratio R/B = 3/5, I can write R = (3/5)B.\n\nNow, substitute this into the total equation: (3/5)B + B = 24.\n\nCombining the terms: (3/5)B + (5/5)B = (8/5)B = 24.\n\nNow, solve for B: B = 24 \u00d7 (5/8) = 15.\n\nThen, R = (3/5) \u00d7 15 = 9.\n\nSo, again, I get 9 red marbles.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered the ratio parts. The ratio is 3:5, which means there are 3 parts red and 5 parts blue, making a total of 8 parts.\n\nEach part represents 24 \u00f7 8 = 3 marbles.\n\nTherefore, red marbles are 3 parts \u00d7 3 = 9.\n\nBlue marbles are 5 parts \u00d7 3 = 15.\n\nTotal 9 + 15 = 24, which checks out.\n\nI think no matter which method I use, I end up with 9 red marbles.\n\nLet me try one more approach to be sure. Let\u2019s use algebra.\n\nLet the common multiplier be x. So, red marbles = 3x, blue marbles = 5x.\n\nTotal marbles: 3x + 5x = 8x = 24.\n\nSo, x = 24 \u00f7 8 = 3.\n\nTherefore, red marbles = 3x = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI feel confident now that the number of red marbles is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
