        "content": "So I've got this puzzle here. There's a room with three light switches, and each switch controls one of three lights in the adjacent room. I can only enter that adjacent room once, and I need to figure out which switch corresponds to which light. Hmm, interesting. Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the properties of the lights and the switches. Each switch can be in one of two positions: on or off. When I flip a switch, it changes the state of the corresponding light. So, if a switch is controlling a light that's off, flipping it should turn it on, and vice versa.\n\nBut the challenge is that I can only enter the adjacent room once to check the lights. That means I need to set up some kind of scenario with the switches before I go in, and then based on the state of the lights when I enter, I can deduce which switch controls which light.\n\nLet me consider the positions of the switches. Suppose I label them Switch A, Switch B, and Switch C for ease of reference. I need to manipulate these switches in a way that will leave distinct marks or states on the lights that I can observe in the adjacent room.\n\nOne idea is to flip one switch and leave the others alone. But that seems too simplistic, because when I enter the adjacent room, only one light would be on, and I wouldn't know which switch controls which light beyond that. I need a way to differentiate all three switches.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the heat generated by the lights. If a light has been on for a while, it might get warm, even after I turn it off. So, perhaps I can turn on Switch A and leave it on for a certain amount of time, then turn it off, and turn on Switch B. Then, quickly go into the adjacent room and check the lights.\n\nIn that case, the light that's on would be controlled by Switch B, the light that's off but warm would be controlled by Switch A, and the light that's off and cool would be controlled by Switch C. That seems promising.\n\nLet me think through this step by step.\n\n1. I turn on Switch A and leave it on for about 10 minutes. This should allow any light controlled by Switch A to heat up if it's an incandescent bulb.\n\n2. After 10 minutes, I turn off Switch A and immediately turn on Switch B.\n\n3.\u8fc5\u901f\u8fdb\u5165\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u706f\u6ce1\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u706f\u6ce1\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff1a\n\n- \u706f\u6ce1\u4eae\u7740\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u7531Switch B\u63a7\u5236\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aSwitch B\u662f\u6700\u540e\u88ab\u6253\u5f00\u7684\u3002\n\n- \u706f\u6ce1\u4e0d\u4eae\u4f46\u53d1\u70ed\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u7531Switch A\u63a7\u5236\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4e4b\u524d\u88ab\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u73b0\u5728\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u706f\u6ce1\u4ecd\u7136\u4f1a\u662f\u6696\u7684\u3002\n\n- \u706f\u6ce1\u4e0d\u4eae\u4e14\u4e0d\u70ed\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u7531Switch C\u63a7\u5236\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u81ea\u59cb\u81f3\u7ec8\u90fd\u662f\u5173\u95ed\u7684\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u706f\u6ce1\u662f\u767d\u70bd\u706f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u767d\u70bd\u706f\u5728\u5173\u95ed\u540e\u4f1a\u9010\u6e10\u51b7\u5374\u3002\u5982\u679c\u706f\u6ce1\u662fLED\u6216\u8367\u5149\u706f\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u53d1\u70ed\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u51b7\u5374\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8fd9\u662f\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f\u767d\u70bd\u706f\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002\n\n\u8ba9\u6211\u518d\u60f3\u60f3\uff0c\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7b49\u5f85\u90a3\u4e48\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u662f\u5229\u7528\u706f\u5149\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u6216\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5148\u6253\u5f00Switch A\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b83\u53d1\u70ed\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6253\u5f00Switch B\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u623f\u95f4\u65f6\uff0cSwitch A\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u706f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u70ed\u7684\u4f46\u5173\u95ed\u7684\uff0cSwitch B\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u706f\u662f\u4eae\u7740\u7684\uff0cSwitch C\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u706f\u662f\u51b7\u7684\u4e14\u5173\u95ed\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u548c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e0d\u7528\u7b49\u5f85\u52a0\u70ed\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n\n\u5047\u8bbe\u6211\u6253\u5f00Switch A\u548cSwitch B\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8fdb\u5165\u623f\u95f4\u4e4b\u524d\u53ea\u5173\u95edSwitch A\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u623f\u95f4\u65f6\uff1a\n\n- \u4eae\u7740\u7684\u706f\u662f\u7531Switch B\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u3002\n\n- \u7184\u706d\u4f46\u70ed\u7684\u706f\u662f\u7531Switch A\u63a7\u5236\u7684\uff08\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4e4b\u524d\u88ab\u6253\u5f00\u8fc7\u5e76\u52a0\u70ed\u4e86\uff09\u3002\n\n- \u7184\u706d\u4e14\u51b7\u7684\u706f\u662f\u7531Switch C\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u7b49\u5f85\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u8ba9\u706f\u6ce1\u52a0\u70ed\uff0c\u4f46\u81f3\u5c11\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6211\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u6d4b\u6e29\u4eea\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u706f\u6ce1\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u9898\u76ee\u4e2d\u8bf4\u53ea\u80fd\u8fdb\u5165\u623f\u95f4\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u5230\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c probably the initial approach is the most straightforward.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Step 1: Turn on Switch A and leave it on for about 10 minutes.\n\n- Step 2: After 10 minutes, turn off Switch A and immediately turn on Switch B.\n\n- Step 3:\u8fc5\u901f\u8fdb\u5165\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u706f\u6ce1\u3002\n\n- Observation:\n\n- The light that is on is controlled by Switch B.\n\n- The light that is off but warm to the touch is controlled by Switch A.\n\n- The light that is off and cool is controlled by Switch C.\n\nThis should allow me to identify which switch controls each light with just one entry into the adjacent room.\n\nI think this should work, assuming that the lights are incandescent bulbs that get noticeably hot when on. If they're LED or fluorescent bulbs, their heating characteristics might be different, and this method could be less reliable.\n\nBut given that this is a puzzle, it's probably safe to assume incandescent bulbs are being used.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{See solution steps above}} \\]"
