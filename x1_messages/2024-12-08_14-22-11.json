        "content": "So, the baker uses 5 eggs for each cake, and he has 60 eggs in total. I need to find out how many cakes he can bake with those eggs.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs required per cake. That should give me the number of cakes he can make.\n\nSo, total eggs are 60, and eggs per cake are 5. So, 60 divided by 5.\n\nLet me do the math: 60 \u00f7 5 = 12.\n\nSo, he can bake 12 cakes with 60 eggs.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there are any eggs left over or if there's a remainder. Let me check: 5 times 12 is 60, so no eggs are left over.\n\nTherefore, the baker can bake exactly 12 cakes with 60 eggs.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication. If each cake requires 5 eggs, then for x cakes, he would need 5x eggs. And he has 60 eggs, so 5x = 60.\n\nSolving for x: x = 60 \u00f7 5 = 12.\n\nAgain, that gives me 12 cakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in portions. If 5 eggs make one cake, then one egg makes one-fifth of a cake. So, 60 eggs would make 60 times one-fifth of a cake.\n\nThat is 60 \u00d7 (1/5) = 12 cakes.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer, which is 12 cakes.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any restrictions or additional factors.\n\nFor example, does the baker need eggs for anything else? The question seems to specify that the only use of eggs is for baking cakes, so I don't need to account for any other usage.\n\nAlso, are there any constraints on the number of cakes he can bake based on other ingredients? The question doesn't mention flour, sugar, or other ingredients, so I'll assume that eggs are the only limiting factor here.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the answer is 12 cakes.\n\nJust to double-check, let's imagine he bakes 12 cakes, using 5 eggs each. That's 12 \u00d7 5 = 60 eggs, which matches the total number of eggs he has.\n\nIf he tried to bake one more cake, that would require 5 more eggs, but he only has 60, so he couldn't bake an additional cake.\n\nTherefore, 12 cakes is the maximum he can bake with 60 eggs.\n\nSo, the final answer is 12 cakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
