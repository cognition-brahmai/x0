        "content": "To create a Python script that reads from a Cassandra database and filters users based on a given age range, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Cassandra environment**: Ensure that Cassandra is installed and running. Create a keyspace and a table to store user information.\n\n2. **Install required Python packages**: You'll need the `cassandra-driver` package to interact with Cassandra from Python.\n\n3. **Write the Python script**: Connect to the Cassandra database, execute a query to fetch users within the specified age range, and process the results.\n\n### Step 1: Set up your Cassandra environment\n\nFirst, ensure that Cassandra is installed and running. You can download and install Cassandra from [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/).\n\nNext, create a keyspace and a table for user information.\n\n```sql\nCREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS user_keyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};\n\nUSE user_keyspace;\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n    name text,\n    email text,\n    age int,\n    PRIMARY KEY (name, email)\n);\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install required Python packages\n\nYou need the `cassandra-driver` package to connect to Cassandra from Python. Install it using pip:\n\n```sh\npip install cassandra-driver\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Python script\n\nHere's a sample Python script that connects to the Cassandra database, reads user data, and filters users based on a given age range.\n\n```python\nfrom cassandra.cluster import Cluster\nfrom cassandra.auth import PlainTextAuthProvider\n\ndef connect_to_cassandra():\n    # Update these credentials as per your Cassandra setup\n    auth_provider = PlainTextAuthProvider(username='cassandra', password='cassandra')\n    cluster = Cluster(['127.0.0.1'], auth_provider=auth_provider)\n    session = cluster.connect()\n    return session\n\ndef fetch_users_in_age_range(session, min_age, max_age):\n    query = f\"SELECT name, email, age FROM user_keyspace.users WHERE age >= {min_age} AND age <= {max_age}\"\n    rows = session.execute(query)\n    return rows\n\ndef main():\n    session = connect_to_cassandra()\n    \n    # Define the age range\n    min_age = 20\n    max_age = 30\n    \n    # Fetch users within the age range\n    users = fetch_users_in_age_range(session, min_age, max_age)\n    \n    # Print the results\n    for user in users:\n        print(f\"Name: {user.name}, Email: {user.email}, Age: {user.age}\")\n\n    # Close the connection\n    session.cluster.shutdown()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connecting to Cassandra**: The `connect_to_cassandra` function sets up a connection to the Cassandra cluster using the provided credentials.\n\n2. **Fetching Users**: The `fetch_users_in_age_range` function constructs a CQL query to select users within the specified age range and executes it.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The `main` function orchestrates the process by connecting to Cassandra, fetching users within the age range, printing their details, and finally closing the connection.\n\nMake sure to update the connection parameters and credentials according to your Cassandra setup. This script provides a basic framework, and you can expand it based on your requirements, such as handling larger datasets or adding more filtering criteria."
