        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a sweater that originally costs $45, and it's on sale for 20% off. We need to find out what the final price will be after applying this discount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Basically, it means that the customer gets a 20% reduction on the original price. So, to find out how much the discount is in dollars, I need to calculate 20% of $45.\n\nTo calculate 20% of $45, I can use the formula:\n\nDiscount amount = (percentage discount / 100) \u00d7 original price\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiscount amount = (20 / 100) \u00d7 45\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n20 divided by 100 is 0.20.\n\nThen, 0.20 multiplied by 45 is 9.\n\nSo, the discount amount is $9.\n\nNow, to find the final price after the discount, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nFinal price = original price - discount amount\n\nFinal price = 45 - 9\n\nFinal price = $36\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate what percentage of the original price the customer actually has to pay. If there's a 20% discount, that means the customer pays 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, 80% of $45 would be:\n\nFinal price = (80 / 100) \u00d7 45\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n80 divided by 100 is 0.80.\n\n0.80 multiplied by 45 is 36.\n\nSo, again, the final price is $36.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also verify this using another method. For example, some stores might apply discounts differently, but in this case, it's a straightforward percentage off.\n\nAlternatively, if the discount was offered in a different way, say, a dollar amount off, or multiple discounts, the calculation would differ, but here it's simply 20% off, so the method I used should be correct.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that this calculation doesn't take into account any additional costs like taxes or shipping fees, which might be applicable in real-world scenarios. However, based on the information provided, we're only dealing with the discount on the sweater's original price.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the final price of the sweater after a 20% discount is $36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
