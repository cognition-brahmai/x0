        "content": "Let's see... There are four siblings: Alice, Bob, Carol, and David. The relationships are a bit confusing, but I'll try to sort them out.\n\nFirst, it says that Alice is older than Bob but younger than Carol. So, Carol is older than Alice, and Alice is older than Bob. That means the order so far is Carol > Alice > Bob.\n\nNext, it says that David is not the youngest sibling. So, David is older than at least one sibling.\n\nNow, we need to figure out where David fits into this sequence.\n\nWe have Carol > Alice > Bob, and David is not the youngest, which means David is not Bob.\n\nSo, David could be older than Alice, or between Alice and Bob, but not younger than Bob.\n\nWait, but since Alice is older than Bob, and David is not the youngest, David is at least older than Bob.\n\nSo, possible orders:\n\n1. Carol > David > Alice > Bob\n\n2. Carol > Alice > David > Bob\n\n3. David > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\nBut, hold on, we know that Alice is younger than Carol, so Carol is older than Alice. So, in option 3, David is older than Carol, which would make David older than Alice, which is consistent with Alice being younger than Carol.\n\nBut, perhaps there are other possibilities.\n\nLet me list out the relationships again:\n\n- Carol > Alice\n\n- Alice > Bob\n\n- David is not the youngest.\n\nSo, David is not the youngest, meaning David is not Bob, and David is older than Bob.\n\nSo, David > Bob.\n\nNow, where does David stand in relation to Alice and Carol?\n\nHe could be older than Carol, or between Carol and Alice, or between Alice and Bob, but we know he's not between Alice and Bob because he's older than Alice (since he's older than Bob and Alice is older than Bob).\n\nWait, no. Actually, David is older than Bob, but we don't know if he's older or younger than Alice.\n\nWait, but Alice is older than Bob, and David is older than Bob, but we don't know if David is older or younger than Alice.\n\nSo, possibilities:\n\n1. Carol > Alice > David > Bob\n\n2. Carol > David > Alice > Bob\n\n3. David > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\nBut, in all these cases, Bob is the youngest.\n\nWait, but let's check if there are other possibilities.\n\nIs it possible that David is younger than Alice but older than Bob? The statement says David is not the youngest, which means he's not Bob, and he's older than Bob.\n\nSo, David > Bob.\n\nBut Alice is also > Bob.\n\nSo, possible orders:\n\n- Carol > Alice > David > Bob\n\n- Carol > David > Alice > Bob\n\n- David > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\nIn all these cases, Bob is the youngest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps David is older than Alice.\n\nIf David is older than Alice, then:\n\n- David > Alice > Bob\n\nBut we already have Carol > Alice.\n\nSo, to combine:\n\n- Carol > David > Alice > Bob\n\nOr - David > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\nWait, but in the second option, David is older than Carol, which might be possible, but perhaps less likely given that Carol is mentioned first, but nothing says anything about David's age relative to Carol.\n\nSo, possible orders:\n\n1. Carol > Alice > David > Bob\n\n2. Carol > David > Alice > Bob\n\n3. David > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\nIn all these cases, Bob is the youngest.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way where Bob is not the youngest?\n\nWait, perhaps if David is between Alice and Bob, but David is not younger than Bob, so he can't be between Alice and Bob.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me try to list all possible orders and eliminate those where David is the youngest.\n\nPossible orders without any constraints:\n\nThere are 4 siblings, so 4! = 24 possible orders.\n\nBut with the constraints:\n\n- Carol > Alice\n\n- Alice > Bob\n\n- David is not the youngest.\n\nSo, Carol is older than Alice, and Alice is older than Bob.\n\nSo, Carol > Alice > Bob.\n\nAnd David is not the youngest, so David is not Bob.\n\nAlso, David's position relative to Alice and Carol is unknown.\n\nSo, possible orders:\n\n1. Carol > Alice > David > Bob\n\n2. Carol > David > Alice > Bob\n\n3. David > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\n4. Carol > Alice > Bob > David (but this would make David younger than Bob, which is not allowed)\n\nSo, this is invalid.\n\n5. David > Alice > Carol > Bob\n\nWait, but Carol > Alice, so this is invalid.\n\n6. David > Alice > Bob > Carol\n\nBut Carol > Alice, so invalid.\n\n7. David > Carol > Bob > Alice\n\nBut Carol > Alice, so this could be possible, but David > Carol, and Bob > Alice, which would make it David > Carol > Bob > Alice.\n\nBut this would mean Bob is older than Alice, which contradicts the given Alice > Bob.\n\nSo, invalid.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider that Carol is the oldest, then Alice, then David, and Bob is the youngest.\n\nAlternatively, David could be older than Carol.\n\nWait, but the statements don't give any relation between David and Carol, except that David is not the youngest.\n\nSo, possible orders:\n\n- Carol > Alice > David > Bob\n\n- Carol > David > Alice > Bob\n\n- David > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\nIn all these, Bob is the youngest.\n\nAlternatively, if David is older than Carol, then:\n\n- David > Carol > Alice > Bob\n\nStill, Bob is the youngest.\n\nOr, if David is between Alice and Bob:\n\n- Carol > Alice > David > Bob\n\nStill, Bob is the youngest.\n\nAlternatively, if David is older than Alice but younger than Carol:\n\n- Carol > David > Alice > Bob\n\nAgain, Bob is the youngest.\n\nSo, in all possible valid orders given the constraints, Bob is the youngest.\n\nTherefore, Bob is the youngest sibling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bob is the youngest sibling.}} \\]"
