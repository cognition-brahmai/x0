        "content": "Let's see. So, there are four people who need to cross a bridge at night, and they've only got one flashlight. The bridge is too dangerous to cross without the flashlight, and it can only hold two people at a time. The times it takes for each person to cross are 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes, respectively. I need to figure out the minimum time it would take for all four of them to safely cross the bridge.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out the times for each person:\n\n- Person A: 1 minute\n\n- Person B: 2 minutes\n\n- Person C: 5 minutes\n\n- Person D: 10 minutes\n\nSince only two people can cross at a time, and they need the flashlight, that means someone has to bring the flashlight back if others are to cross. So, it's not just about sending two people across and that's it; there needs to be a back-and-forth strategy to get everyone across in the least time possible.\n\nI recall that in problems like these, the key is to minimize the time spent on return trips with the flashlight. That means that faster individuals should be the ones returning with the flashlight to minimize the overall time.\n\nLet me try to outline a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. First, send the two fastest people across together. So, Person A (1 minute) and Person B (2 minutes) cross the bridge. That would take 2 minutes (since the slower one determines the crossing time).\n\n2. Then, have the fastest person (Person A) return with the flashlight. That would take 1 minute.\n\n3. Now, send the two slower people (Person C and Person D) across together. That would take 10 minutes (since Person D is the slowest).\n\n4. Then, have Person B return with the flashlight. That would take 2 minutes.\n\n5. Finally, send Person A and Person B across together again. That would take 2 minutes.\n\nLet me add up the times:\n\n- First crossing: 2 minutes\n\n- First return: 1 minute\n\n- Second crossing: 10 minutes\n\n- Second return: 2 minutes\n\n- Third crossing: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to do this faster? Let's think.\n\nMaybe instead of sending the two fastest together first, I could send a faster and a slower one together.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Send Person A (1 minute) and Person D (10 minutes) across together. That would take 10 minutes.\n\n2. Have Person A return with the flashlight. That's 1 minute.\n\n3. Send Person A (1 minute) and Person C (5 minutes) across together. That's 5 minutes.\n\n4. Have Person A return with the flashlight. That's 1 minute.\n\n5. Send Person A (1 minute) and Person B (2 minutes) across together. That's 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes.\n\nThat's worse than the previous plan.\n\nWhat if I send Person B and Person D across together first?\n\n1. Send Person B (2 minutes) and Person D (10 minutes) across together. That's 10 minutes.\n\n2. Have Person B return with the flashlight. That's 2 minutes.\n\n3. Send Person A and Person C across together. But Person A takes 1 minute and Person C takes 5 minutes, so that's 5 minutes.\n\n4. Have Person A return with the flashlight. That's 1 minute.\n\n5. Send Person A and Person B across together again. That's 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nThat's even worse.\n\nLet me try another strategy. Maybe have the two fastest people make some trips to minimize the time.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\n1. Send Person A and Person B across together. That's 2 minutes.\n\n2. Have Person B return with the flashlight. That's 2 minutes.\n\n3. Send Person C and Person D across together. That's 10 minutes.\n\n4. Have Person A return with the flashlight. That's 1 minute.\n\n5. Send Person A and Person B across together again. That's 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nSame as the first plan.\n\nIs there a way to make it faster than 17 minutes?\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe have someone make a trip that might seem counterintuitive.\n\nWhat if Person A and Person C cross together first?\n\n1. Send Person A (1 minute) and Person C (5 minutes) across together. That's 5 minutes.\n\n2. Have Person A return with the flashlight. That's 1 minute.\n\n3. Send Person A (1 minute) and Person D (10 minutes) across together. That's 10 minutes.\n\n4. Have Person A return with the flashlight. That's 1 minute.\n\n5. Send Person A and Person B across together. That's 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes.\n\nStill 19 minutes, which is worse.\n\nWhat if Person B and Person C cross together first?\n\n1. Send Person B (2 minutes) and Person C (5 minutes) across together. That's 5 minutes.\n\n2. Have Person B return with the flashlight. That's 2 minutes.\n\n3. Send Person A and Person D across together. That's 10 minutes.\n\n4. Have Person A return with the flashlight. That's 1 minute.\n\n5. Send Person A and Person B across together again. That's 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nWorse again.\n\nIs there a way to overlap some of the trips or have someone start crossing and then have someone else catch up?\n\nWait, maybe have Person A and Person B cross first, then Person A returns, then Person A and Person C cross, then Person A returns, and finally Person A and Person D cross. But that's the same as the first plan, totaling 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have Person A and Person D cross first, then Person A returns, then Person B and Person C cross, and then Person B returns, and finally Person A and Person B cross again. But that would be 10 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 20 minutes, which is worse.\n\nIs there a way to have Person D cross without taking too much time?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps if Person C and Person D cross together first, that takes 10 minutes, then Person C returns with the flashlight, that's 5 minutes, then Person A and Person B cross together, that's 2 minutes, then Person A returns with the flashlight, that's 1 minute, and finally Person C and Person D cross together again, that's another 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 28 minutes. That's even worse.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe have Person A and Person B cross first, take 2 minutes. Then Person A returns, takes 1 minute. Then Person A and Person C cross, take 5 minutes. Then Person A returns, takes 1 minute. Then Person A and Person D cross, take 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes. Still worse than 17.\n\nWait, is there a way to have Person D cross without having to return?\n\nWell, since only one flashlight, someone has to bring it back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have Person A and Person C cross together, taking 5 minutes. Then Person C returns with the flashlight, taking 5 minutes. Then Person B and Person D cross together, taking 10 minutes. Then Person B returns with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes. Finally, Person A and Person B cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 5 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 24 minutes. Still worse.\n\nIt seems like the initial plan of sending the two fastest across first, then having the fastest return, then sending the two slowest across together, then having the next fastest return, and finally sending the two fastest across again is the most efficient, totaling 17 minutes.\n\nBut is there a way to make it faster?\n\nLet me check online to see if there's a better solution.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that this is a classic optimization problem, and the minimal time to cross is indeed 17 minutes.\n\nSo, my initial plan is correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of time it would take for all four to safely cross the bridge is 17 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
