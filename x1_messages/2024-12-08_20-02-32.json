        "content": "So you've got a product that costs $200, and there's a 15% discount on it. You want to know how much you'll save and what the final price will be after the discount. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, to find out how much you'll save, you need to calculate 15% of $200. The percentage symbol (%) means per hundred, so 15% is the same as 15 per 100, or 15/100, which is 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nSo, to find 15% of $200, you multiply 200 by 0.15:\n\n200 \u00d7 0.15 = 30\n\nSo, you'll save $30 on the product.\n\nNext, to find the final price after the discount, you subtract the savings from the original price:\n\n200 - 30 = 170\n\nTherefore, the final price you'll pay is $170.\n\nAlternatively, you can calculate the final price directly by figuring out what percentage of the original price you actually have to pay. If there's a 15% discount, that means you're paying 100% - 15% = 85% of the original price.\n\nSo, to find 85% of $200:\n\n200 \u00d7 0.85 = 170\n\nAgain, you get $170 as the final price.\n\nBoth methods give you the same result, so you can choose whichever you find easier to understand.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Savings: $30\n\n- Final price: $170\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
