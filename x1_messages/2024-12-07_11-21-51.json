        "content": "So, the train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours. Then it takes the same time to go back. Now, if the speed doubles, meaning it goes at 120 miles per hour, how long would it take to travel between the two towns?\n\nFirst, I need to find out the distance between Town A and Town B. Since speed is 60 miles per hour and time is 2 hours, distance should be speed multiplied by time, right? So, 60 miles per hour times 2 hours equals 120 miles.\n\nDistance from A to B: 120 miles.\n\nNow, if the train doubles its speed, it goes at 120 miles per hour. I need to find out how long it takes to travel 120 miles at 120 miles per hour.\n\nTime is distance divided by speed, so 120 miles divided by 120 miles per hour should be 1 hour.\n\nWait, but the question says \"to travel between the two towns,\" and it takes the same time to go back. Does that mean the total time for a round trip?\n\nInitially, it takes 2 hours to go from A to B and 2 hours to go back from B to A, so total time is 4 hours.\n\nBut if the speed doubles to 120 miles per hour, the time for one way is 1 hour, so round trip would be 2 hours.\n\nBut the question might be asking for one way travel time at the doubled speed.\n\nLooking back, it says: \"how long would it take the train to travel between the two towns if its speed doubled?\"\n\nSo, it's probably asking for one way travel time at the doubled speed.\n\nSo, distance is 120 miles, speed is 120 miles per hour, time is 1 hour.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the speed doubles for both directions.\n\nWait, the initial scenario is that it takes 2 hours each way at 60 mph.\n\nIf speed doubles to 120 mph for both ways, then time each way is 1 hour.\n\nSo, total round trip time would be 2 hours.\n\nBut the question might just be asking for one way time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's something about relative speeds or something else I'm missing.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"It takes the train 2 hours to travel from Town A to Town B. If it takes the same amount of time to travel back from Town B to Town A, how long would it take the train to travel between the two towns if its speed doubled?\"\n\nSo, it's saying that the time for both directions is the same, 2 hours each way, at 60 mph.\n\nThen, if speed doubles to 120 mph, how long would it take to travel between the two towns?\n\n\"Between the two towns\" could mean one way or round trip.\n\nBut the way it's phrased, it's probably asking for one way travel time at the doubled speed.\n\nSo, distance is 120 miles, speed is 120 mph, time is 1 hour.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me into not considering something.\n\nWait, maybe the train doesn't travel at a constant speed, or there are other factors.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nDistance is speed multiplied by time: 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nAt doubled speed: 120 mph.\n\nTime is distance divided by speed: 120 miles / 120 mph = 1 hour.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1 hour.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the question is asking for the total time for round trip at the doubled speed.\n\nThen, each way takes 1 hour, so total round trip time would be 2 hours.\n\nBut the way it's worded, \"to travel between the two towns,\" which typically means one way.\n\nMoreover, it specifies \"if its speed doubled,\" meaning the new speed is 120 mph for the journey.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, the time should be 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
