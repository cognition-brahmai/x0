He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical physics, particularly for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. His theory of relativity, which includes both the special and general theories of relativity, has had a profound impact on our understanding of space, time, and gravity."
