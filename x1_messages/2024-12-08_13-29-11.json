        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a new sports complex in a city. The total construction budget is $50 million, and it's going to have three main parts: a stadium, a swimming pool, and tennis courts. The costs are broken down like this: 60% for the stadium, 25% for the swimming pool, and 15% for the tennis courts. Then, I need to figure out how many square feet can be allocated to each facility based on an average construction cost of $200 per square foot. Okay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the individual budgets for each facility. Starting with the stadium, which is 60% of the total budget. So, I'll take 60% of $50 million.\n\nTo calculate that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 0.60. So, 0.60 times $50 million.\n\n0.60 * 50,000,000 = 30,000,000\n\nSo, the stadium's budget is $30 million.\n\nNext, the swimming pool is 25% of the total budget. Again, convert 25% to a decimal, which is 0.25, and multiply by $50 million.\n\n0.25 * 50,000,000 = 12,500,000\n\nTherefore, the swimming pool's budget is $12.5 million.\n\nThen, the tennis courts get 15% of the total budget. 15% as a decimal is 0.15, so:\n\n0.15 * 50,000,000 = 7,500,000\n\nSo, the tennis courts have a budget of $7.5 million.\n\nNow, I need to determine how many square feet can be allocated to each facility based on an average construction cost of $200 per square foot. To find the square footage, I'll divide each facility's budget by the cost per square foot.\n\nStarting with the stadium:\n\n$30,000,000 / $200 per square foot = 150,000 square feet\n\nFor the swimming pool:\n\n$12,500,000 / $200 per square foot = 62,500 square feet\n\nAnd for the tennis courts:\n\n$7,500,000 / $200 per square foot = 37,500 square feet\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Stadium: $30 million, 150,000 square feet\n\n- Swimming pool: $12.5 million, 62,500 square feet\n\n- Tennis courts: $7.5 million, 37,500 square feet\n\nI think that's it. It seems straightforward once I break it down into steps. Just have to make sure I'm converting percentages correctly and doing the divisions right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Stadium: } 150,000 \\text{ square feet}, \\text{ Swimming Pool: } 62,500 \\text{ square feet}, \\text{ Tennis Courts: } 37,500 \\text{ square feet}} \\]"
