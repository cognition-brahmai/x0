Differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus that allows us to find the rate at which a function is changing at any given point. The derivative of a function gives us the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at each point.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basic Rules of Differentiation\n\nBefore we dive into the problem, let's recall some basic rules of differentiation that will be useful here:\n\n1. **Power Rule**: The derivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( n x^{n-1} \\), where \\( n \\) is any real number.\n2. **Sum Rule**: The derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of the derivatives of each function.\n3. **Constant Multiple Rule**: The derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.\n4. **Constant Rule**: The derivative of a constant is zero.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Sum Rule\n\nThe given function is a sum of several terms: \\( x^3 \\), \\( -4x^2 \\), \\( 2x \\), and \\( -1 \\). According to the sum rule, we can differentiate each term separately and then add the results together.\n\nSo, \\( f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) + \\frac{d}{dx}(-4x^2) + \\frac{d}{dx}(2x) + \\frac{d}{dx}(-1) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Differentiate Each Term\n\nNow, let's differentiate each term one by one.\n\n#### Term 1: \\( x^3 \\)\n\nUsing the power rule, where \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^{3-1} = 3x^2 \\).\n\n#### Term 2: \\( -4x^2 \\)\n\nFirst, apply the constant multiple rule. The derivative of \\( -4x^2 \\) is \\( -4 \\) times the derivative of \\( x^2 \\).\n\nUsing the power rule, where \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x^{2-1} = 2x \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(-4x^2) = -4 \\times 2x = -8x \\).\n\n#### Term 3: \\( 2x \\)\n\nAgain, apply the constant multiple rule. The derivative of \\( 2x \\) is \\( 2 \\) times the derivative of \\( x \\).\n\nUsing the power rule, where \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1x^{1-1} = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\).\n\n#### Term 4: \\( -1 \\)\n\nUsing the constant rule, the derivative of a constant is zero.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(-1) = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Derivatives\n\nNow, add up the derivatives of all the terms:\n\n\\( f'(x) = 3x^2 + (-8x) + 2 + 0 \\).\n\nSimplify by combining like terms:\n\n\\( f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 2 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe derivative of the function \\( f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 1 \\) is \\( f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 2 \\).\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3x^{2} - 8x + 2} \\]\n\n### Additional Insight\n\nTo ensure understanding, it's helpful to visualize the original function and its derivative. The original function \\( f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 1 \\) is a cubic polynomial, which typically has a \"S\" shape. Its derivative, \\( f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 2 \\), is a quadratic function, which is a parabola. The points where the derivative equals zero correspond to the critical points of the original function, such as local maxima or minima.\n\nFurthermore, the second derivative, \\( f''(x) = 6x - 8 \\), can be used to determine the concavity of the original function and to find points of inflection.\n\n### Practice Problem\n\nTo reinforce your understanding, try finding the derivative of another polynomial function, such as \\( g(x) = 5x^4 - 3x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 7 \\), using the same steps we've just gone through.\n\n### Solution to Practice Problem\n\n1. Apply the sum rule to differentiate each term separately.\n2. For each term, use the power rule, constant multiple rule, or constant rule as appropriate.\n3. Combine the derivatives of all terms.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n- \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(5x^4) = 20x^3 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(-3x^3) = -9x^2 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2) = 4x \\)\n- \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(-x) = -1 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(7) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( g'(x) = 20x^3 - 9x^2 + 4x - 1 \\).\n\n### Final Answer for Practice Problem\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20x^{3} - 9x^{2} + 4x - 1} \\]"
