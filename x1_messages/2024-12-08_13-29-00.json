        "content": "To show that the set of all continuous functions on the interval [0,1] forms a vector space, we need to verify that it satisfies the axioms of a vector space. A vector space over a field (in this case, the field of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)) must satisfy the following properties:\n\n1. **Closure under addition**: For any two functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) in the set, their sum \\( f + g \\) must also be in the set.\n\n2. **Closure under scalar multiplication**: For any function \\( f \\) in the set and any scalar \\( c \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), the product \\( c f \\) must also be in the set.\n\n3. **Commutativity of addition**: For all \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) in the set, \\( f + g = g + f \\).\n\n4. **Associativity of addition**: For all \\( f \\), \\( g \\), and \\( h \\) in the set, \\( (f + g) + h = f + (g + h) \\).\n\n5. **Existence of an additive identity**: There exists a function \\( 0 \\) in the set such that for any function \\( f \\), \\( f + 0 = f \\).\n\n6. **Existence of additive inverses**: For every function \\( f \\) in the set, there exists a function \\( -f \\) such that \\( f + (-f) = 0 \\).\n\n7. **Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication**: For any scalars \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any function \\( f \\), \\( a(b f) = (a b) f \\).\n\n8. **Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition**: For any scalar \\( a \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\), \\( a(f + g) = a f + a g \\).\n\n9. **Distributivity of scalar multiplication over field addition**: For any scalars \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any function \\( f \\), \\( (a + b) f = a f + b f \\).\n\n10. **Identity element of scalar multiplication**: For the scalar \\( 1 \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any function \\( f \\), \\( 1 f = f \\).\n\nLet's verify each of these properties for the set of all continuous functions on the interval [0,1].\n\n### 1. Closure under addition\n\nLet \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) be two continuous functions on [0,1]. The sum \\( (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) \\) is also continuous because the sum of two continuous functions is continuous. Therefore, \\( f + g \\) is in the set.\n\n### 2. Closure under scalar multiplication\n\nLet \\( f \\) be a continuous function on [0,1] and \\( c \\) be a scalar in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The product \\( (c f)(x) = c f(x) \\) is continuous because the scalar multiple of a continuous function is continuous. Therefore, \\( c f \\) is in the set.\n\n### 3. Commutativity of addition\n\nFor any two continuous functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\), \\( (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = g(x) + f(x) = (g + f)(x) \\). Hence, \\( f + g = g + f \\).\n\n### 4. Associativity of addition\n\nFor any three continuous functions \\( f \\), \\( g \\), and \\( h \\), \\( (f + g) + h)(x) = (f(x) + g(x)) + h(x) = f(x) + (g(x) + h(x)) = (f + (g + h))(x) \\). Therefore, \\( (f + g) + h = f + (g + h) \\).\n\n### 5. Existence of an additive identity\n\nThe zero function \\( 0(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in [0,1] is continuous. For any continuous function \\( f \\), \\( f + 0 = f \\).\n\n### 6. Existence of additive inverses\n\nFor any continuous function \\( f \\), the function \\( -f \\) defined by \\( (-f)(x) = -f(x) \\) is also continuous. Therefore, \\( f + (-f) = 0 \\).\n\n### 7. Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication\n\nFor any scalars \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any continuous function \\( f \\), \\( a(b f)(x) = a(b f(x)) = (a b) f(x) = (a b f)(x) \\). Thus, \\( a(b f) = (a b) f \\).\n\n### 8. Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition\n\nFor any scalar \\( a \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any continuous functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\), \\( a(f + g)(x) = a(f(x) + g(x)) = a f(x) + a g(x) = (a f + a g)(x) \\). Hence, \\( a(f + g) = a f + a g \\).\n\n### 9. Distributivity of scalar multiplication over field addition\n\nFor any scalars \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any continuous function \\( f \\), \\( (a + b) f)(x) = (a + b) f(x) = a f(x) + b f(x) = (a f + b f)(x) \\). Therefore, \\( (a + b) f = a f + b f \\).\n\n### 10. Identity element of scalar multiplication\n\nFor the scalar \\( 1 \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any continuous function \\( f \\), \\( 1 f)(x) = 1 \\cdot f(x) = f(x) \\). Hence, \\( 1 f = f \\).\n\nSince all the vector space axioms are satisfied, we can conclude that the set of all continuous functions on the interval [0,1] forms a vector space over the field of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)."
