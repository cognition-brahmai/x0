        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. To develop a simple Java application that connects to a MySQL database, creates a table named \"students\" with columns for name, age, and major, and inserts some sample data, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your MySQL database:**\n   - Install MySQL if you haven't already.\n   - Create a new database (e.g., `studentdb`).\n\n2. **Prepare your Java project:**\n   - Set up a new Java project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ).\n   - Add the MySQL JDBC driver to your project's classpath.\n\n3. **Write the Java code:**\n   - Import necessary Java SQL classes.\n   - Establish a connection to the MySQL database.\n   - Create a SQL statement to create the \"students\" table.\n   - Execute the SQL statement to create the table.\n   - Insert sample data into the \"students\" table.\n   - Close the database connection.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide with sample code:\n\n### Step 1: Set up your MySQL database\n\nFirst, make sure you have MySQL installed and running. You can download it from [mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com/).\n\nCreate a new database:\n\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE studentdb;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Prepare your Java project\n\nCreate a new Java project in your IDE. For this example, I'll assume you're using Eclipse.\n\n#### Adding MySQL JDBC Driver\n\n1. Download the MySQL JDBC driver from [MySQL Connectors](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).\n2. In Eclipse, right-click on your project \u2192 Build Path \u2192 Configure Build Path.\n3. Go to the \"Libraries\" tab \u2192 Add External JARs \u2192 Select the downloaded MySQL JDBC driver JAR file \u2192 Apply and Close.\n\n### Step 3: Write the Java code\n\nCreate a new Java class, say `StudentDatabase`, and write the following code:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.sql.Statement;\n\npublic class StudentDatabase {\n\n    // Database credentials\n    static final String URL = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/studentdb\";\n    static final String USER = \"your_username\";\n    static final String PASSWORD = \"your_password\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // SQL statement to create the students table\n        String createTableSQL = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (\"\n                + \"id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\"\n                + \"name VARCHAR(100),\"\n                + \"age INT,\"\n                + \"major VARCHAR(100)\"\n                + \")\";\n\n        // SQL statement to insert sample data\n        String insertDataSQL = \"INSERT INTO students (name, age, major) VALUES \"\n                + \"('John Doe', 20, 'Computer Science'),\"\n                + \"('Jane Smith', 22, 'Mathematics'),\"\n                + \"('Mike Johnson', 21, 'Physics')\";\n\n        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);\n             Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {\n\n            // Create the table\n            statement.execute(createTableSQL);\n            System.out.println(\"Table 'students' created successfully.\");\n\n            // Insert sample data\n            int rowsAffected = statement.executeUpdate(insertDataSQL);\n            System.out.println(rowsAffected + \" rows inserted successfully.\");\n\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Database Credentials:**\n   - Update `USER` and `PASSWORD` with your MySQL username and password.\n\n2. **SQL Statements:**\n   - `createTableSQL`: Creates the \"students\" table with columns for name, age, and major. The `id` column is an auto-increment primary key.\n   - `insertDataSQL`: Inserts sample data into the \"students\" table.\n\n3. **Java Code:**\n   - Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using `DriverManager.getConnection`.\n   - Uses a `Statement` object to execute the SQL commands.\n   - Closes the connection automatically using the try-with-resources statement.\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. Make sure your MySQL server is running.\n2. Compile and run the `StudentDatabase` class in your IDE.\n3. Check your MySQL database to verify that the \"students\" table is created and sample data is inserted.\n\nThat's it! You've successfully created a simple Java application that connects to a MySQL database, creates a table, and inserts sample data."
