        "content": "In professional sports coaching, the strategy commonly used to improve an athlete's performance by creating a detailed plan for achieving their sport-specific goals is D. Periodization.\n\nPeriodization is a training approach that involves dividing the training process into specific phases or periods, each with its own objectives and methods. This systematic planning helps athletes progressively improve their performance over time by systematically varying the intensity and volume of their training.\n\nWhile performance profiling (option B) is also a useful tool for identifying an athlete's strengths and weaknesses, it is more of an assessment technique rather than a training strategy. Reactive coaching (option A) focuses on responding to immediate situations or problems as they arise, which can be part of a broader coaching strategy but isn't typically the primary method for long-term performance improvement. Motivational speaking (option C) can inspire athletes but doesn't provide the structured approach needed for systematic performance enhancement.\n\nTherefore, periodization is the most appropriate choice for creating a detailed plan to achieve sport-specific goals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
