        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and 5% of those are defective. I need to find out how many non-defective widgets are made in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many defective widgets are made each day. If 5% are defective, then out of 1000 widgets, that would be 5% of 1000.\n\nTo calculate 5% of 1000, I can multiply 1000 by 0.05, since 5% is the same as 5 per 100 or 0.05 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 1000 times 0.05 equals 50. That means there are 50 defective widgets per day.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-defective widgets per day, I can subtract the defective ones from the total produced each day.\n\nSo, 1000 minus 50 equals 950 non-defective widgets per day.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, I can multiply the daily non-defective production by 7 to get the weekly total.\n\nSo, 950 times 7 equals 6650.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 6650 non-defective widgets in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way could be to calculate the total weekly production first and then find out how many are defective and non-defective.\n\nSo, the factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and there are 7 days in a week, so total weekly production is 1000 times 7, which is 7000 widgets.\n\nNow, if 5% are defective, then defective widgets in a week would be 5% of 7000.\n\nAgain, 5% of 7000 is 7000 times 0.05, which is 350 defective widgets.\n\nThen, non-defective widgets would be total widgets minus defective ones: 7000 minus 350 equals 6650.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 6650 non-defective widgets per week.\n\nAlright, that makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6650} \\]"
