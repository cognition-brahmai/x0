        "content": "Let's see here. The train travels 300 miles in 5 hours. I need to find out how far it will travel in 7 hours at the same speed. Hmm, this seems like a problem about speed and distance. I remember that speed is distance divided by time. So, if the train travels 300 miles in 5 hours, its speed must be 300 miles divided by 5 hours, right?\n\nLet me calculate that: 300 miles \u00f7 5 hours = 60 miles per hour. So, the train's speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how far it will travel in 7 hours at this same speed. If speed is distance over time, then distance must be speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nSo, distance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 7 hours = 420 miles.\n\nWait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Another way to think about it is to see how many miles the train travels per hour, which is 60 miles, and then multiply that by 7 hours to get 420 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion. If 5 hours corresponds to 300 miles, then 7 hours corresponds to x miles. So, 5/300 = 7/x, or something like that. Wait, no. Actually, it should be miles per hour, so maybe 300 miles is to 5 hours as x miles is to 7 hours. So, 300/5 = x/7.\n\nLet me solve for x: 300/5 = 60, and 60 = x/7, so x = 60 \u00d7 7 = 420 miles. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using the concept of unit rate. The unit rate here is the speed, which is 60 miles per hour. So, for each hour, the train travels 60 miles. Therefore, in 7 hours, it would travel 7 times 60 miles, which is 420 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the additional 2 hours beyond the initial 5 hours. Since the train travels 300 miles in 5 hours, in 1 hour it travels 60 miles, as before. So, in 2 extra hours, it would travel 2 \u00d7 60 = 120 miles. Therefore, the total distance in 7 hours would be 300 miles plus 120 miles, which is 420 miles again.\n\nWait a minute, there's another approach using dimensional analysis. If I have 300 miles in 5 hours, I can write that as 300 miles / 5 hours = 60 miles/hour. Then, to find the distance in 7 hours, I can multiply the speed by the time: 60 miles/hour \u00d7 7 hours = 420 miles. The hours unit cancels out, leaving miles, which makes sense.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 420 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{420} \\]"
