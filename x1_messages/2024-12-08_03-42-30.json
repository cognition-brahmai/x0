        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a man who gives away his money in three stages and ends up with nothing left. I need to find out how much money he had originally.\n\nFirst, he gives half of his money to his wife. Let's say he had x amount of money at the start. So, he gives x/2 to his wife. That means he's left with x - x/2 = x/2.\n\nNext, he gives half of the remaining amount to his son. He had x/2 left, so he gives (x/2)/2 = x/4 to his son. Now, he's left with x/2 - x/4 = x/4.\n\nFinally, he gives $20 to his daughter and has no money left. So, the remaining amount after giving to his son is x/4, and he gives all of that minus $20 to his daughter, but actually, he gives $20 to his daughter and has nothing left, which means x/4 = $20.\n\nSo, x/4 = 20.\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by 4:\n\nx = 20 * 4\n\nx = 80.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf he had $80 originally:\n\n1. Gave half to his wife: 80/2 = $40 to wife, left with 80 - 40 = $40.\n\n2. Gave half of the remaining to his son: half of 40 is 20, so gave $20 to son, left with 40 - 20 = $20.\n\n3. Gave $20 to his daughter, left with 20 - 20 = $0.\n\nPerfect, that matches the condition that he has no money left after these gifts.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother method could be to work backwards. Starting from the end and reversing each step.\n\nHe ends with $0 after giving $20 to his daughter. So, before giving to his daughter, he must have had $20.\n\nBefore that, he gave half of his remaining money to his son. So, if he had $20 before giving to his daughter, that $20 was half of what he had before giving to his son. So, before giving to his son, he had $20 * 2 = $40.\n\nBefore that, he gave half of his original money to his wife. So, if he had $40 before giving to his son, that $40 was half of his original amount. Therefore, originally, he had $40 * 2 = $80.\n\nAgain, that matches our previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to represent the entire process.\n\nLet original amount be x.\n\nAfter giving to wife: x - x/2 = x/2 remaining.\n\nAfter giving to son: x/2 - (x/2)/2 = x/2 - x/4 = x/4 remaining.\n\nAfter giving to daughter: x/4 - 20 = 0.\n\nSo, x/4 - 20 = 0.\n\nAdd 20 to both sides: x/4 = 20.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4: x = 80.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's clear that the man originally had $80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
