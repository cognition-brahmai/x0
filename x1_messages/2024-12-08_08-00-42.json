        "content": "Let's see here. The train is going at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 30 minutes to get from Town A to Town B. I need to find out how far apart these towns are.\n\nFirst, I should remember the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, I have the speed, which is 60 miles per hour, and the time, which is 30 minutes. But wait, the units need to match. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in minutes, so I need to convert the time into hours to make it consistent.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, time = 0.5 hours.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 0.5 hours = 30 miles\n\nSo, the towns are 30 miles apart.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If the train is going at 60 miles per hour, that means it covers 60 miles in one hour. In half an hour, it should cover half of that distance, which is 30 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to think about it in terms of rates, the train covers 60 miles in 60 minutes, so in 30 minutes, it would cover 30 miles. Same answer.\n\nI think that's correct. The towns are 30 miles apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
