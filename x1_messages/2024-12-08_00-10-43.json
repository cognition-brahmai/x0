        "content": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3\n\nWhere V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the diameter is 12 centimeters, the radius (r) would be half of that, which is 6 centimeters.\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (6 cm)\u00b3\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * 216 cm\u00b3\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * 216 cm\u00b3\n\nV = 288 \u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nApproximating \u03c0 as 3.1416:\n\nV \u2248 288 * 3.1416 cm\u00b3\n\nV \u2248 904.776 cm\u00b3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 904.776 cubic centimeters."
