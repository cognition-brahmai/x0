        "content": "So I've got this question about refraction of light passing from glass into air. The angle of incidence is 30 degrees, and the refractive index of glass is 1.5. I need to find the angle of refraction in air. The options are 30, 45, 60, 75, and 49 degrees. I remember something called Snell's law, which relates the angles and refractive indices. Let me see if I can apply it here.\n\nSnell's law states that n1 sin\u03b81 = n2 sin\u03b82, where n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second mediums, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, light is going from glass (n1 = 1.5) to air (n2 \u2248 1). The angle of incidence in glass is 30 degrees. So, plugging into Snell's law:\n\n1.5 * sin(30\u00b0) = 1 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nI know that sin(30\u00b0) is 0.5, so:\n\n1.5 * 0.5 = 1 * sin(\u03b82)\n\n0.75 = sin(\u03b82)\n\nNow, to find \u03b82, I need to take the inverse sine (sin\u207b\u00b9) of 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate sin\u207b\u00b9(0.75). I think that's around 48.59 degrees. But looking at the options, 49 degrees is one of them.\n\nWait a minute, the options include 49 degrees, which is very close to 48.59 degrees. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nn1 = 1.5 (glass)\n\nn2 = 1 (air)\n\n\u03b81 = 30 degrees\n\nApply Snell's law:\n\nn1 sin\u03b81 = n2 sin\u03b82\n\n1.5 * sin(30\u00b0) = 1 * sin\u03b82\n\nsin(30\u00b0) = 0.5, so:\n\n1.5 * 0.5 = sin\u03b82\n\n0.75 = sin\u03b82\n\nNow, \u03b82 = sin\u207b\u00b9(0.75)\n\nCalculating sin\u207b\u00b9(0.75):\n\nUsing a calculator, sin\u207b\u00b9(0.75) \u2248 48.59 degrees.\n\nRounding up, it's approximately 49 degrees.\n\nLooking back at the options, E is 49 degrees, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, is there something about the light spreading out when it exits the glass? The question mentions that the light spreads out, which is consistent with going from a higher refractive index to a lower one, which is what's happening here (glass to air).\n\nAlso, I should confirm if the angle of incidence is measured correctly. Yes, it's given as 30 degrees in glass.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if there's total internal reflection. But in this case, since the light is going from glass to air, and the angle of incidence is 30 degrees, which is less than the critical angle (which for glass to air is around 41.8 degrees for n=1.5), so there shouldn't be total internal reflection. The light should indeed refract into the air.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the angle of refraction is approximately 49 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49^\\circ} \\]"
