The input should be a question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Initial course of action derived from the user's question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to execute along with input parameters]\nPlan: [Subsequent course of action informed by :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to run along with its inputs, possibly including prior evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: holding the ultimate answer]\n\nQuestion: Who wrote \"War and Peace\" and what other works did they author?"
