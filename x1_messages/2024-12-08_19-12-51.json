The construction cost per acre is $50,000, with an additional $10,000 per acre for landscaping and amenities. Calculate the total cost of building the park, considering a 5% contingency budget for unforeseen expenses. Also, estimate the annual maintenance cost if it's expected to be 3% of the initial construction cost."

        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, we need to calculate the total construction cost for the park. The park is 10 acres, and the construction cost per acre is $50,000. So, the basic construction cost would be:\n\n10 acres * $50,000/acre = $500,000\n\nBut there's also an additional $10,000 per acre for landscaping and amenities. So, that would be:\n\n10 acres * $10,000/acre = $100,000\n\nAdding that to the basic construction cost gives us:\n\n$500,000 + $100,000 = $600,000\n\nNow, we need to add a 5% contingency budget for unforeseen expenses. To find 5% of $600,000:\n\n0.05 * $600,000 = $30,000\n\nSo, the total cost of building the park would be:\n\n$600,000 + $30,000 = $630,000\n\nNext, we need to estimate the annual maintenance cost, which is expected to be 3% of the initial construction cost. The initial construction cost is $600,000, so:\n\n0.03 * $600,000 = $18,000\n\nTherefore, the annual maintenance cost is estimated to be $18,000.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Total construction cost: $600,000\n\n- Contingency budget: $30,000\n\n- Total cost of building the park: $630,000\n\n- Annual maintenance cost: $18,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{630,000 \\text{ total cost, } 18,000 \\text{ annual maintenance}} \\]"
