        "content": "So the hospital wants to improve its emergency response time by adding more ambulances to its fleet. They currently have 5 ambulances with an average response time of 15 minutes, and they want to reduce that to under 10 minutes. They receive an average of 60 calls per day, with peak hours between 4 pm and 8 pm when they receive 50% of their daily calls. Each ambulance takes an average of 45 minutes to complete a call. I need to figure out how many additional ambulances are needed to achieve this goal.\n\nFirst, I should understand what determines the response time. The response time is likely influenced by how busy the ambulances are. If all ambulances are occupied, new calls will have to wait until one becomes available. So, the number of ambulances affects the waiting time for a free ambulance.\n\nI recall that in queueing theory, there's a concept called server utilization, which is the proportion of time that a server is busy. In this case, each ambulance is a server. If the utilization is too high, the waiting time increases.\n\nLet me define some variables:\n\n- Let \u03bb be the arrival rate of calls.\n\n- Let \u03bc be the service rate per ambulance.\n\n- Let c be the number of ambulances.\n\nThe arrival rate \u03bb is 60 calls per day. But since the call pattern varies throughout the day, with peak hours between 4 pm and 8 pm accounting for 50% of the calls, I should consider the peak hour load to ensure that the response time is met during the busiest period.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many calls come in during peak hours.\n\nTotal calls per day: 60\n\nPeak hours: 4 pm to 8 pm, which is 4 hours.\n\nPercentage of calls during peak hours: 50%\n\nSo, calls during peak hours: 0.5 * 60 = 30 calls per day.\n\nNow, I need to find the arrival rate during peak hours. Since peak hours are 4 hours long, the arrival rate \u03bb_peak is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = 30 calls per day / 4 hours = 7.5 calls per hour.\n\nSimilarly, off-peak hours are the remaining 20 hours of the day, receiving the other 30 calls:\n\n\u03bb_off_peak = 30 calls per day / 20 hours = 1.5 calls per hour.\n\nBut to ensure that the response time is met throughout the day, I should focus on the peak period, as that's when the system is most strained.\n\nNext, I need to determine the service rate \u03bc. The problem states that each ambulance takes an average of 45 minutes to complete a call. So, the service time is 45 minutes per call.\n\nFirst, let's convert service time to hours, since arrival rate is in calls per hour.\n\n45 minutes = 0.75 hours.\n\nTherefore, service rate \u03bc = 1 / service time = 1 / 0.75 hours = 1.333 calls per hour per ambulance.\n\nNow, I can model this as an M/M/c queue, where:\n\n- M: Poisson arrival process.\n\n- M: Exponential service time.\n\n- c: number of servers (ambulances).\n\nIn an M/M/c queue, the average response time (which includes both waiting time and service time) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nW = (\u03bb + (\u03bb^2 + 2c\u03bc(\u03bb - c\u03bc))^(1/2)) / (2c\u03bc - \u03bb)\n\nBut I need to make sure that W < 10 minutes, which is 10/60 = 1/6 hours.\n\nWait, actually, I need to be careful here. The formula I recall might not be exact. Let me look up the formula for the average time in the system for an M/M/c queue.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the average time spent in the system (W) in an M/M/c queue is:\n\nW = L / \u03bb\n\nwhere L is the average number of customers in the system.\n\nL can be calculated using the Erlang C formula.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for W in terms of \u03bb, \u03bc, and c.\n\nLet me recall the formula:\n\nW = 1 / \u03bc + (\u03bb / (c \u03bc)) * (E(c\u03c1) / (1 - \u03c1))\n\nwhere \u03c1 = \u03bb / (c \u03bc) is the traffic intensity.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that in an M/M/c queue, the expected number of customers in the system (L) is:\n\nL = \u03bb * W\n\nand W can be found using the formula:\n\nW = 1 / \u03bc + L_q / \u03bb\n\nwhere L_q is the average number of customers in the queue.\n\nBut this seems circular.\n\nPerhaps it's better to use the formula for the probability that all servers are busy, and then find the waiting time based on that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Erlang C formula to find the average waiting time.\n\nThe Erlang C formula is:\n\nC(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) = ( (c * \u03c1)^c / c! ) / (sum from k=0 to c-1 of ( (c * \u03c1)^k / k! ) ) + ( (c * \u03c1)^c / c! ) / (sum from k=0 to c-1 of ( (c * \u03c1)^k / k! ) + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) )\n\nwhere \u03c1 = \u03bb / (c \u03bc)\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use an approximation or a rule of thumb.\n\nLet me think differently. If each ambulance takes 45 minutes per call, and they receive 30 calls during peak hours, I can calculate the total service time required and see how many ambulances are needed to handle that within the desired response time.\n\nFirst, total service time needed during peak hours is 30 calls * 45 minutes per call = 1350 minutes.\n\nPeak hours are 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.\n\nSo, if we have c ambulances, each can provide 240 minutes of service during peak hours.\n\nBut since each call takes 45 minutes, each ambulance can handle 240 / 45 \u2248 5.33 calls per peak hour period.\n\nBut since they can't handle a fraction of a call, let's say each ambulance can handle 5 calls during peak hours.\n\nTherefore, to handle 30 calls, they would need 30 / 5 = 6 ambulances.\n\nBut they already have 5 ambulances, so they would need 1 additional ambulance.\n\nHowever, this doesn't take into account the response time. They want the response time to be under 10 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is too simplistic.\n\nLet me try another approach using queueing theory.\n\nIn an M/M/c queue, the formula for the average waiting time in the queue (W_q) is:\n\nW_q = (\u03bb / (c \u03bc - \u03bb)) * (1 / (c \u03bc - \u03bb)) * (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)))\n\nBut this seems overly complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the average time spent in the system (W) is:\n\nW = 1 / \u03bc + W_q\n\nAnd response time would be similar to W.\n\nSo, I need W < 10 minutes.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the units are consistent.\n\nLet's work in hours.\n\nCurrent response time is 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours.\n\nDesired response time is less than 10 minutes, which is less than 0.1667 hours.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03bb_peak = 7.5 calls per hour\n\n\u03bc = 1 / 0.75 = 1.333 calls per hour per ambulance\n\nc = number of ambulances (currently 5, but we need to find the required c)\n\nFirst, calculate the traffic intensity \u03c1:\n\n\u03c1 = \u03bb / (c \u03bc) = 7.5 / (c * 1.333)\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer c such that W < 0.1667 hours.\n\nBut I need a formula for W in terms of \u03bb, \u03bc, and c.\n\nUpon looking it up, in an M/M/c queue, the average time spent in the system is:\n\nW = 1 / (\u03bc - \u03bb / c)\n\nBut this seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check.\n\nActually, in an M/M/c queue, W is more complex.\n\nHere's a more accurate formula:\n\nW = 1 / \u03bc + (\u03bb / (c \u03bc - \u03bb)) * (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) * (1 / (c \u03bc - \u03bb))\n\nThis still looks complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Erlang C formula to find W.\n\nThe Erlang C formula gives the probability that a call has to wait for an ambulance:\n\nC(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) = ( (c * \u03c1)^c / c! ) / (sum from k=0 to c-1 of ( (c * \u03c1)^k / k! ) ) + ( (c * \u03c1)^c / c! ) / (sum from k=0 to c-1 of ( (c * \u03c1)^k / k! ) + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) )\n\nThen, the average waiting time W_q is:\n\nW_q = C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) / (c \u03bc - \u03bb)\n\nAnd the average time in the system W is:\n\nW = W_q + 1 / \u03bc\n\nSo, I need W < 0.1667 hours.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03c1:\n\n\u03c1 = \u03bb / (c \u03bc) = 7.5 / (c * 1.333)\n\nLet me denote \u03bc = 1.333 calls per hour per ambulance.\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest integer c such that W < 0.1667 hours.\n\nThis seems too complicated to solve analytically, so maybe I can try different values of c and see what W is.\n\nStart with c = 5, which is the current number of ambulances.\n\nCalculate \u03c1:\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (5 * 1.333) = 7.5 / 6.665 \u2248 1.125\n\nWait, \u03c1 should be less than 1 for the queue to be stable, but here \u03c1 = 1.125 > 1, which means the system is unstable. That makes sense because currently, with 5 ambulances, the response time is 15 minutes, which is higher than desired.\n\nSo, I need to increase c until W < 0.1667 hours.\n\nLet me try c = 6.\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (6 * 1.333) = 7.5 / 7.998 \u2248 0.938\n\nNow, calculate C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc):\n\nFirst, compute the sum from k=0 to c-1 of ( (c * \u03c1)^k / k! ):\n\nsum = 1 + (c * \u03c1) + (c * \u03c1)^2 / 2! + ... + (c * \u03c1)^(c-1) / (c-1)!\n\nFor c=6 and \u03c1=0.938, c * \u03c1 = 6 * 0.938 \u2248 5.628\n\nsum = 1 + 5.628 + (5.628)^2 / 2 + (5.628)^3 / 6 + (5.628)^4 / 24 + (5.628)^5 / 120\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n1: 1\n\n2: 5.628\n\n3: (5.628)^2 / 2 \u2248 31.67 / 2 \u2248 15.835\n\n4: (5.628)^3 / 6 \u2248 178.1 / 6 \u2248 29.683\n\n5: (5.628)^4 / 24 \u2248 999.5 / 24 \u2248 41.646\n\n6: (5.628)^5 / 120 \u2248 5600 / 120 \u2248 46.667\n\nsum \u2248 1 + 5.628 + 15.835 + 29.683 + 41.646 + 46.667 \u2248 140.459\n\nNow, compute (c * \u03c1)^c / c! = (5.628)^6 / 720 \u2248 5600 * 5.628 / 720 \u2248 31.487\n\nThen, denominator of C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) is sum + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) = sum + 31.487 / (720 * 0.062) \u2248 sum + 31.487 / 44.64 \u2248 sum + 0.705 \u2248 140.459 + 0.705 \u2248 141.164\n\nSo, C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) = 31.487 / 141.164 \u2248 0.223\n\nNow, W_q = C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) / (c \u03bc - \u03bb) = 0.223 / (6 * 1.333 - 7.5) = 0.223 / (7.998 - 7.5) \u2248 0.223 / 0.498 \u2248 0.448 hours \u2248 26.88 minutes\n\nThen, W = W_q + 1 / \u03bc = 0.448 + 0.75 \u2248 1.198 hours \u2248 71.9 minutes\n\nWait, that's worse than the current response time. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the Erlang C formula.\n\nActually, I think I misapplied the formula. The correct formula for Erlang C is:\n\nC(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) = ( (c * \u03c1)^c / c! ) / ( sum from k=0 to c-1 of ( (c * \u03c1)^k / k! ) + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) ) )\n\nSo, denominator is sum from k=0 to c-1 of ( (c * \u03c1)^k / k! ) + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1))\n\nSo, denominator = sum + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1))\n\nIn my earlier calculation, I mistakenly added sum and (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) separately.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nGiven sum = 140.459\n\nAnd (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) = 31.487 / (720 * 0.062) = 31.487 / 44.64 \u2248 0.705\n\nSo, denominator = sum + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) = 140.459 + 0.705 \u2248 141.164\n\nThen, C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) = (c * \u03c1)^c / c! / denominator = 0.705 / 141.164 \u2248 0.005\n\nWait, that's much smaller than before.\n\nThen, W_q = C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) / (c \u03bc - \u03bb) = 0.005 / (7.998 - 7.5) \u2248 0.005 / 0.498 \u2248 0.010 hours \u2248 0.6 minutes\n\nThen, W = W_q + 1 / \u03bc = 0.010 + 0.75 \u2248 0.76 hours \u2248 45.6 minutes\n\nHmm, that's still higher than the desired 10 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating sum.\n\nLet me recompute sum from k=0 to 5 of (5.628)^k / k!\n\nCompute each term:\n\nk=0: 1\n\nk=1: 5.628\n\nk=2: (5.628)^2 / 2 \u2248 31.67 / 2 \u2248 15.835\n\nk=3: (5.628)^3 / 6 \u2248 178.1 / 6 \u2248 29.683\n\nk=4: (5.628)^4 / 24 \u2248 999.5 / 24 \u2248 41.646\n\nk=5: (5.628)^5 / 120 \u2248 5600 / 120 \u2248 46.667\n\nsum \u2248 1 + 5.628 + 15.835 + 29.683 + 41.646 + 46.667 \u2248 140.459\n\nAnd (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) = (5.628)^6 / 720 / 0.062 \u2248 5600 / 720 / 0.062 \u2248 7.778 / 0.062 \u2248 125.452\n\nWait, that's different from before.\n\nSo, denominator = sum + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) = 140.459 + 125.452 \u2248 265.911\n\nThen, C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) = (c * \u03c1)^c / c! / (denominator) = 7.778 / 265.911 \u2248 0.029\n\nThen, W_q = C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) / (c \u03bc - \u03bb) = 0.029 / (7.998 - 7.5) \u2248 0.029 / 0.498 \u2248 0.058 hours \u2248 3.48 minutes\n\nThen, W = W_q + 1 / \u03bc = 0.058 + 0.75 \u2248 0.808 hours \u2248 48.5 minutes\n\nStill higher than the desired 10 minutes.\n\nMaybe I need to increase c further.\n\nLet's try c = 7.\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (7 * 1.333) \u2248 7.5 / 9.331 \u2248 0.804\n\nNow, c * \u03c1 \u2248 7 * 0.804 \u2248 5.628\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Wait, no, c is 7 now.\n\nActually, c * \u03c1 = 7 * 0.804 \u2248 5.628\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Wait, no, with c=7 and \u03c1=0.804, c*\u03c1=7*0.804=5.628, same as before.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate \u03c1.\n\n\u03c1 = \u03bb / (c \u03bc) = 7.5 / (7 * 1.333) = 7.5 / 9.331 \u2248 0.804, yes.\n\nBut earlier with c=6, \u03c1 was 0.938, but now with c=7, \u03c1=0.804.\n\nWait, actually, earlier I mistakenly used c=6 to get \u03c1=0.938, but with c=6, \u03c1=7.5/(6*1.333)=7.5/7.998\u22480.938, but now with c=7, \u03c1=7.5/(7*1.333)=7.5/9.331\u22480.804.\n\nWait, but in the previous calculation for c=6, I had c*\u03c1=6*0.938\u22485.628, and for c=7, c*\u03c1=7*0.804\u22485.628, so it's the same.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps increasing c doesn't change c*\u03c1 as much as I thought.\n\nThis might indicate a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the service time is 45 minutes per call, and during peak hours, there are 30 calls in 4 hours.\n\nSo, total service time required is 30*45=1350 minutes.\n\nAvailable time is 4 hours * 60 minutes = 240 minutes.\n\nSo, to cover 1350 minutes of service time in 240 minutes, need at least 1350/240\u22485.625 ambulances.\n\nBut they already have 5, which matches this calculation, but their response time is 15 minutes, which is higher than desired.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that ambulances are not always available due to being on calls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the utilization rate.\n\nUtilization \u03c1 = arrival rate / (number of servers * service rate)\n\nIn this case, \u03c1 = \u03bb / (c \u03bc)\n\nWe want \u03c1 < 1 to have a stable system.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can set \u03c1 to a certain value to achieve the desired response time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that relates response time to the number of servers.\n\nUpon checking, in an M/M/c queue, the expected waiting time in the system is:\n\nW = 1 / \u03bc + (\u03c1)^c * (c!)^2 / (c^c * (c - \u03bb / \u03bc)^2) * P0 / (c! * (1 - \u03c1))\n\nBut this seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in an M/M/c queue, the average response time is inversely proportional to the number of servers.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nMaybe I should consider that each additional ambulance reduces the waiting time.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can set up an equation where W < 0.1667 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate different values of c and see when W drops below 0.1667 hours.\n\nLet me try c=8.\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (8 * 1.333) = 7.5 / 10.664 \u2248 0.703\n\nThen, c*\u03c1=8*0.703\u22485.624\n\nNow, sum from k=0 to 7 of (5.624)^k / k!\n\nCompute each term:\n\nk=0: 1\n\nk=1: 5.624\n\nk=2: (5.624)^2 / 2 \u2248 31.63 / 2 \u2248 15.815\n\nk=3: (5.624)^3 / 6 \u2248 177.7 / 6 \u2248 29.617\n\nk=4: (5.624)^4 / 24 \u2248 996.4 / 24 \u2248 41.517\n\nk=5: (5.624)^5 / 120 \u2248 5600 / 120 \u2248 46.667\n\nk=6: (5.624)^6 / 720 \u2248 31.4 / 720 \u2248 0.0436\n\nk=7: (5.624)^7 / 5040 \u2248 176.4 / 5040 \u2248 0.035\n\nsum \u2248 1 + 5.624 + 15.815 + 29.617 + 41.517 + 46.667 + 0.0436 + 0.035 \u2248 140.322\n\nNow, (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) = (5.624)^8 / (40320 * 0.297) \u2248 176.4 / 40320 / 0.297 \u2248 0.0043 / 0.297 \u2248 0.0145\n\nDenominator = sum + (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)) = 140.322 + 0.0145 \u2248 140.3365\n\nC(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) = (c * \u03c1)^c / c! / denominator = 0.0043 / 140.3365 \u2248 0.00003\n\nThen, W_q = C(c, \u03bb, \u03bc) / (c \u03bc - \u03bb) = 0.00003 / (8 * 1.333 - 7.5) \u2248 0.00003 / (10.664 - 7.5) \u2248 0.00003 / 3.164 \u2248 0.0000095 hours \u2248 0.00057 minutes \u2248 0.034 seconds\n\nThen, W = W_q + 1 / \u03bc = 0.0000095 + 0.75 \u2248 0.7500095 hours \u2248 45.00057 minutes\n\nStill higher than desired.\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense. With c=8, W is still around 45 minutes, which is higher than the desired 10 minutes.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the service time includes both travel time and on-scene time. Maybe I need to break down the 45 minutes into these components.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the response time is only the waiting time for an ambulance, not including the service time.\n\nWait, actually, in queueing theory, W includes both waiting time and service time.\n\nBut in this context, response time likely includes both the waiting time for an ambulance to become available and the time it takes to reach the scene.\n\nAssuming that the travel time is part of the service time, then W would represent the total time from when the call is made until the ambulance arrives.\n\nBut perhaps I need to model travel time separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the response time is just the waiting time in the queue, and the service time is the time spent at the scene and returning.\n\nWait, maybe I need to distinguish between response time and total time.\n\nIn emergency services, response time often refers to the time from when the call is received until the ambulance arrives at the scene.\n\nService time would include the time spent at the scene providing care and possibly returning to the hospital.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to model response time separately from service time.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose that the response time is the sum of waiting time for an ambulance and travel time to the scene.\n\nIf I assume that travel time is a fixed or average value, say t minutes, then the response time would be W_q + t.\n\nBut I don't have information about the travel time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the 15-minute current response time includes both waiting time and travel time, and they want to reduce the overall response time to under 10 minutes.\n\nIn that case, I need to reduce W (waiting time plus service time) to under 10 minutes.\n\nBut in my earlier calculations, even with c=8, W is around 45 minutes, which is way above the desired 10 minutes.\n\nThis suggests that either my approach is wrong or that the hospital needs many more ambulances to achieve their goal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a flaw in my assumptions.\n\nLet me go back to basics.\n\nTotal calls per day: 60\n\nPeak hours: 4 pm to 8 pm, 4 hours, 50% of calls \u2192 30 calls in 4 hours \u2192 \u03bb_peak = 7.5 calls per hour\n\nOff-peak: 20 hours, 30 calls \u2192 \u03bb_off_peak = 1.5 calls per hour\n\nFocus on peak hours since that's when the system is most strained.\n\nEach ambulance can handle one call at a time, and each call takes 45 minutes on average.\n\nSo, service time: 45 minutes per call \u2192 \u03bc = 1 / 0.75 hours per call = 1.333 calls per hour per ambulance\n\nCurrent number of ambulances: 5\n\nCurrent response time: 15 minutes (0.25 hours)\n\nDesired response time: less than 10 minutes (0.1667 hours)\n\nI need to find the smallest integer c such that W < 0.1667 hours during peak hours.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to use the formula for W in an M/M/c queue.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the expected time spent in the system (W) in an M/M/c queue is:\n\nW = 1 / \u03bc + (\u03bb / (c \u03bc - \u03bb)) * (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)))\n\nWhere \u03c1 = \u03bb / (c \u03bc)\n\nBut this seems too complex for manual calculation. Maybe I can use an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in an M/M/c queue, the relationship between W, \u03bb, \u03bc, and c is such that increasing c decreases W.\n\nGiven that, I can try different values of c until W < 0.1667 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up an equation and solve for c.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nSet W < 0.1667 hours\n\nW = 1 / \u03bc + (\u03bb / (c \u03bc - \u03bb)) * (c * \u03c1)^c / (c! * (1 - \u03c1)))\n\nBut this is too complicated to solve directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ignore the queueing and use a simpler model.\n\nSuppose that during peak hours, the hospital receives 7.5 calls per hour, and each ambulance can complete 1.333 calls per hour.\n\nWith c ambulances, the total service rate is c * 1.333 calls per hour.\n\nThe utilization \u03c1 = \u03bb / (c \u03bc) = 7.5 / (c * 1.333)\n\nFor the system to be stable, \u03c1 < 1.\n\nThe average number of calls in the system is L = \u03bb * W.\n\nBut I need to relate W to c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the waiting time is inversely proportional to the number of ambulances beyond the utilization rate.\n\nThis is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the complexity of the M/M/c queue formulas, perhaps it's better to use a rule of thumb or a simplification.\n\nOne rule of thumb is that the waiting time decreases as the number of servers increases, following the formula:\n\nW_q \u2248 (\u03c1)^c * \u03bb / (c \u03bc (c - \u03bb / \u03bc)^2)\n\nBut this is still complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the waiting time is approximately \u03c1 / (c \u03bc - \u03bb)\n\nBut this seems too simplistic.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that the exact calculation is too complicated without computational tools and instead use an iterative approach.\n\nStart with c=5:\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (5 * 1.333) \u2248 1.125 \u2192 system unstable\n\nc=6:\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (6 * 1.333) \u2248 0.938\n\nc=7:\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (7 * 1.333) \u2248 0.804\n\nc=8:\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (8 * 1.333) \u2248 0.703\n\nc=9:\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (9 * 1.333) \u2248 0.617\n\nc=10:\n\n\u03c1 = 7.5 / (10 * 1.333) \u2248 0.55\n\nContinuing this way, increasing c will decrease \u03c1, which should decrease W.\n\nBut from earlier calculations, even with c=8, W is around 45 minutes, which is still higher than the desired 10 minutes.\n\nThis suggests that the hospital may need significantly more ambulances to achieve their goal, which may not be practical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming that W includes both waiting time and service time, while the response time only includes waiting time plus travel time.\n\nIf I assume that the service time is separate from the response time, then perhaps I need to model the waiting time plus travel time to be less than 10 minutes.\n\nBut without information on travel time, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the response time is only the waiting time for an ambulance, and the service time is the time spent at the scene.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with usual definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the response time is the sum of waiting time and travel time, and the service time is the time spent at the scene.\n\nIf I assume that travel time is a fixed value, say t minutes, then response time = W_q + t\n\nAnd I need response time < 10 minutes.\n\nBut without knowing t, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the current response time of 15 minutes includes both W_q and t, and they want to reduce the overall response time to less than 10 minutes.\n\nIn that case, if I can estimate t, I can find the required W_q.\n\nBut again, without knowing t, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the travel time is part of the service time.\n\nIf I assume that the service time includes both travel time and time at the scene, then W would include both waiting time and travel time.\n\nIn that case, I need W < 10 minutes.\n\nBut in my earlier calculations, even with c=8, W is around 45 minutes, which is higher than desired.\n\nThis suggests that either the assumptions are wrong or that the hospital needs many more ambulances, which may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that ambulances can be dispatched while still in travel, but that seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the service time is only the time at the scene, and travel time is separate.\n\nIn that case, response time = W_q + travel time\n\nAnd total time = response time + service time\n\nBut without knowing the travel time, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the 45-minute service time includes both travel time and time at the scene.\n\nIn that case, W would include waiting time plus travel time plus time at the scene.\n\nBut then, reducing W to 10 minutes would require W < 10 minutes, which seems impossible if service time is 45 minutes.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the definitions.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Response time: time from when the call is received until the ambulance arrives at the scene.\n\n- Service time: time spent at the scene providing care and returning to the hospital.\n\nIf I assume that response time = W_q + travel time\n\nAnd service time is separate.\n\nThen, total time = response time + service time.\n\nBut the problem states that they want to reduce the response time to under 10 minutes.\n\nAssuming that travel time is a fixed value, say t minutes, then W_q + t < 10 minutes.\n\nIf I can estimate t, then I can find the required W_q.\n\nBut without knowing t, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the current response time of 15 minutes includes W_q and t, and they want to reduce the overall response time to less than 10 minutes.\n\nIn that case, if I can find the relationship between W_q and t, I can find the required c.\n\nBut this seems too speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that the exact calculation is too complex without more information and instead make an estimate.\n\nGiven that during peak hours, they receive 30 calls in 4 hours, with each call requiring 45 minutes of service.\n\nTotal service time required: 30 calls * 45 minutes = 1350 minutes\n\nTotal time available: 4 hours * 60 minutes = 240 minutes\n\nSo, they need at least 1350 / 240 \u2248 5.625 ambulances to handle the load without any waiting time.\n\nBut since they already have 5 ambulances and have a response time of 15 minutes, which is higher than desired, they need more ambulances.\n\nTo reduce the response time to under 10 minutes, they likely need to have more ambulances than the minimum required to handle the load.\n\nPerhaps doubling the number of ambulances would halve the response time.\n\nSo, if they have 10 ambulances, response time might be around 7.5 minutes, which is less than 10 minutes.\n\nBut this is just a rough estimate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they need to have 15 ambulances to achieve a response time of less than 10 minutes.\n\nBut this seems excessive.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the lack of specific formulas, perhaps the best approach is to recommend that the hospital conducts a detailed queueing analysis or engages a consultant to determine the exact number of ambulances needed to meet their response time goals.\n\nAlternatively, they could consider implementing a dispatching system that prioritizes calls based on severity, which might help reduce response times without needing additional ambulances.\n\nThey could also look into ways to reduce service time, such as improving protocols at the scene or having faster turnaround times at the hospital.\n\nAnother option is to have some ambulances based at different locations to reduce travel times.\n\nHowever, these are beyond the scope of the current problem.\n\nIn conclusion, to achieve a response time of under 10 minutes during peak hours, the hospital likely needs to significantly increase its number of ambulances beyond the current 5. Based on rough estimates, they may need around 10 to 15 ambulances, but this is speculative. A more precise analysis requiring detailed queueing models or simulations would be necessary to determine the exact number of additional ambulances needed."
