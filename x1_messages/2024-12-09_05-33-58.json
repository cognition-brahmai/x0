        "content": "A rainbow is composed of seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors are visible because of the way light is refracted, or bent, when it passes through water droplets in the air. The different colors of light bend at slightly different angles, causing them to separate into the familiar rainbow pattern. The sequence of colors always appears in the same order, with red on the outer edge and violet on the inner edge."
