        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. We have a group of 50 people, out of which 20 have brown eyes and 30 have blue eyes. We need to find the probability that if we randomly select two people from this group, both of them have blue eyes.\n\nOkay, first things first, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So in this case, the favorable outcome is selecting two people with blue eyes, and the total outcomes are all possible ways to select any two people from the group.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate the total number of ways to select two people from 50. I think it's a combination problem because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 50 is \"50 choose 2.\" The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(50, 2) = 50! / (2!(50 - 2)!) = (50 \u00d7 49) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 1225. So, there are 1225 possible pairs of people that can be selected from the group.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, we need both people to have blue eyes. There are 30 people with blue eyes. So, the number of ways to choose 2 people with blue eyes is \"30 choose 2.\"\n\nCalculating C(30, 2) = 30! / (2!(30 - 2)!) = (30 \u00d7 29) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 435.\n\nSo, there are 435 favorable pairs where both people have blue eyes.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 435 / 1225.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both 435 and 1225 can be divided by 5.\n\n435 \u00f7 5 = 87\n\n1225 \u00f7 5 = 245\n\nSo, it becomes 87 / 245.\n\nI'll check if this can be simplified further. Let's see, 87 and 245.\n\n87 divided by 3 is 29, and 245 divided by 5 is 49. Since there are no common factors between 29 and 49, 87/245 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this probability as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n87 divided by 245 is approximately 0.3551, which is about 35.51%.\n\nSo, the probability that both selected people have blue eyes is 87/245, or approximately 35.51%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities sequentially.\n\nLet's think about it step by step. When we select the first person, the probability that they have blue eyes is 30 out of 50, which is 30/50 = 3/5.\n\nThen, given that the first person has blue eyes, there are now 29 people with blue eyes left out of a total of 49 people remaining.\n\nSo, the probability that the second person also has blue eyes, given that the first one does, is 29/49.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is (3/5) \u00d7 (29/49).\n\nLet's calculate that: (3/5) \u00d7 (29/49) = (3 \u00d7 29) / (5 \u00d7 49) = 87 / 245.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier using combinations.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is 87/245.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check this with another approach.\n\nSuppose we use the general probability formula for independent events, but in this case, the selections are dependent because the population changes after the first selection.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider the probability of selecting two blue-eyed people in any order.\n\nBut I think I've already covered it adequately with the combination method and the sequential probability method, and both give the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 87/245 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{87}{245}} \\]"
