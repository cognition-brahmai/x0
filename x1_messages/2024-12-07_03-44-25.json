        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: if I flip a coin three times, what's the chance of getting heads exactly twice? Okay, let's see. Probability can be a bit tricky, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times. Each flip has two possible results: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for three flips, the total number of possible outcomes should be 2 multiplied by itself three times, right? That is, 2^3 = 8. So, there are 8 possible sequences of heads and tails.\n\nLet me list them out to make sure:\n\n1. HHH\n\n2. HHT\n\n3. HTH\n\n4. HTT\n\n5. THH\n\n6. THT\n\n7. TTH\n\n8. TTT\n\nOkay, that's 8 possible outcomes. Now, I need to find out how many of these outcomes have exactly two heads. Let's look at the list:\n\n1. HHH - that's three heads, not two.\n\n2. HHT - that's two heads and one tail.\n\n3. HTH - that's also two heads and one tail.\n\n4. HTT - that's one head and two tails.\n\n5. THH - two heads and one tail.\n\n6. THT - one head and two tails.\n\n7. TTH - one head and two tails.\n\n8. TTT - no heads.\n\nSo, from the list, the outcomes with exactly two heads are HHT, HTH, and THH. That's three outcomes.\n\nNow, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, it should be 3 (favorable outcomes) divided by 8 (total possible outcomes). That gives me 3/8.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that there's also a formula for this kind of problem, called the binomial probability formula. It's used when there are two possible outcomes, like in coin flips. The formula is:\n\nP(k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips),\n\n- k is the number of successful trials (getting heads),\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (0.5 for a fair coin),\n\n- \"n choose k\" is the combination formula, which calculates the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials.\n\nLet me apply this formula to see if I get the same answer.\n\nFirst, n = 3 (since I'm flipping the coin three times), and k = 2 (I want exactly two heads). The probability of getting heads on a single flip is p = 0.5.\n\nSo, P(2) = (3 choose 2) * (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^(3-2)\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \"3 choose 2\". That's the number of combinations of 3 things taken 2 at a time. I know that \"n choose k\" is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, 3 choose 2 = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = (3*2*1) / (2*1 * 1) = 6 / 2 = 3.\n\nNow, (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and (0.5)^(1) = 0.5.\n\nSo, P(2) = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5 = 3 * 0.125 = 0.375.\n\nWait, 0.375 is the same as 3/8. So, both methods give me the same answer.\n\nThat makes sense because in the first method, I manually counted the number of favorable outcomes, which was 3, and divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which was 8, giving 3/8. Using the binomial formula, I also got 3/8.\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly two heads in three coin flips is 3/8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using tree diagrams or something like that.\n\nLet's try drawing a probability tree for three coin flips.\n\nFirst flip: two branches, H and T, each with probability 0.5.\n\nSecond flip: from each of the first outcomes, again two branches, H and T, each with probability 0.5.\n\nThird flip: same as before, two branches from each of the second outcomes, H and T, each with probability 0.5.\n\nSo, the tree would have 8 endpoints, corresponding to the 8 possible outcomes I listed earlier.\n\nNow, for each path that leads to exactly two heads, I can calculate the probability of that path by multiplying the probabilities along the way.\n\nLet's take HHT:\n\nFirst flip H: 0.5\n\nSecond flip H: 0.5\n\nThird flip T: 0.5\n\nSo, probability of HHT is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125.\n\nSimilarly, for HTH:\n\nFirst flip H: 0.5\n\nSecond flip T: 0.5\n\nThird flip H: 0.5\n\nProbability is again 0.125.\n\nAnd for THH:\n\nFirst flip T: 0.5\n\nSecond flip H: 0.5\n\nThird flip H: 0.5\n\nAgain, 0.125.\n\nSo, each of the three favorable outcomes has a probability of 0.125. Since these outcomes are mutually exclusive (they can't happen at the same time), I can add their probabilities together to get the total probability of getting exactly two heads.\n\nSo, 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.375, which is again 3/8.\n\nAlright, so all these different methods are confirming that the probability is 3/8.\n\nLet me just consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, does the order matter? In coin flips, each flip is independent, so the order doesn't affect the probability.\n\nWait, but in some problems, order might matter. For instance, if I were looking for a specific sequence like HHT, then the order would matter. But here, I'm only concerned with the total number of heads, not the order in which they appear.\n\nSo, in that case, it's a combinations problem, not a permutations problem. That's why I use \"n choose k\" instead of permutations.\n\nJust to double-check, if I were to calculate the number of permutations with exactly two heads, that would be different. But since the coin flips are independent and the order doesn't matter for the count of heads, combinations are the way to go.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the binomial coefficient, which is what \"n choose k\" is. It represents the number of ways to choose k successes (heads) out of n trials (flips), without regard to order.\n\nSo, in this case, it's appropriate to use the binomial coefficient.\n\nLet me also consider if the coin is fair. In all the calculations above, I assumed that the coin is fair, meaning that the probability of heads or tails on each flip is 0.5.\n\nIf the coin were unfair, say with probability p of heads and q = 1 - p of tails, then the formula would be P(k) = (n choose k) * p^k * q^(n-k).\n\nBut since it's a fair coin, p = q = 0.5, which is what I used.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe the independence of the flips. Each coin flip is independent of the others, meaning that the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the outcome of the others.\n\nThat's an important assumption in this problem. If the flips were dependent, for example, if getting heads on one flip increased the chance of getting tails on the next, then the calculations would be different.\n\nBut in standard coin-flipping scenarios, we assume independence.\n\nLet me also think about using the complement to find the probability. The complement of getting exactly two heads is getting zero, one, or three heads.\n\nThe probability of getting exactly two heads would then be 1 minus the probability of getting zero, one, or three heads.\n\nBut that seems like more work, since I'd have to calculate those probabilities separately and then subtract from 1.\n\nGiven that directly calculating the probability of exactly two heads is straightforward, using the complement isn't necessary here.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is using the binomial probability formula for general n and k, but since n is small (n=3), it's easier to list out the possibilities.\n\nIn summary, using both the straightforward counting method and the binomial probability formula, I've arrived at the same answer of 3/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads in three coin flips is 3/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} \\]"
