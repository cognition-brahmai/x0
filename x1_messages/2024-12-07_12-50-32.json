        "content": "A ribbon from the sky,\nDraped in colors bright,\nArching high, so rare to spy,\nIn the aftermath of night.\n\nRed, like the dawn's first blush,\nOrange, warm and mellow,\nYellow, shining with hush,\nGreen, where the grassesellow.\n\nBlue, as deep as the sea,\nIndigo, a mystery,\nViolet, a dream's decree,\nAll in a spectrum set free.\n\nEach hue, a promise made,\nIn the light's refractive play,\nA bridge from earth to shades,\nWhere the sun and rainrays sway.\n\nEmily might say, in her way,\n\"Hope is the thing with feathers,\"\nAnd the rainbow, in its array,\nIs hope that nature imparts.\n\nSo when the storm has passed,\nAnd the sky begins to clear,\nLook for the bow, so vast,\nA symbol of peace, year after year.\n\nFor in its beauty, we find,\nA moment to pause and see,\nThe world, once more, entwined,\nIn colors wild and carefree.\n\nJust as Emily found solace,\nIn the simple things of life,\nSo too, the rainbow's grace,\nBrings comfort, brings delight.\n\nOh, rainbow, child of rain and sun,\nYour colors speak to the soul,\nA transient wonder, never done,\nA poem in the sky, to extol.\n\nSo let us cherish each appearance,\nAnd in its light, find our way,\nFor in the rainbow's declaration,\nWe find a path to brighter day."
