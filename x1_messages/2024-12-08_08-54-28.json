Every morning, she'd collect one egg from her chicken coop, two apples from the orchard, and three carrots from the garden. With her basket brimming, she'd cross four bridges to reach the market, where she'd sell her produce to five regular customers. One day, a traveler approached her, offering ten gold coins for a special recipe. Intrigued, Lily accepted, and together they created a dish that became famous across ten kingdoms."
