The broadcast, which was presented in the style of a news bulletin, led many listeners to believe that an actual alien invasion was underway. This misunderstanding resulted in public confusion and fear, with some people fleeing their homes or calling authorities for information. The incident has since become a famous example of the power of media and the potential for misinformation to cause mass hysteria."
