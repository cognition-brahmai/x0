        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour, and we need to find out how far it will go in 15 minutes. Okay, first things first, I need to recall the basic formula that connects speed, time, and distance. I think it's:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nThat makes sense. So, if I plug in the values I have, speed is 80 miles per hour, and time is 15 minutes. But wait, there's a unit mismatch here. Time is in minutes, and speed is in hours. I need to make sure both units are compatible.\n\nLet me convert 15 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 minutes would be 15/60 = 0.25 hours. So now, time is 0.25 hours.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\nDistance = 80 miles per hour \u00d7 0.25 hours = 20 miles\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. But maybe there's another way to think about it. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since the train is going 80 miles in one hour, and one hour has 60 minutes, I could find out how many miles it travels per minute.\n\nSo, 80 miles / 60 minutes = 1.333... miles per minute.\n\nThen, for 15 minutes, it would be 1.333... miles per minute \u00d7 15 minutes = 20 miles again.\n\nHmm, same answer. That gives me more confidence.\n\nWait a minute, what if I think in terms of proportions? If in 60 minutes it travels 80 miles, then in 15 minutes, which is quarter of an hour, it should travel a quarter of 80 miles.\n\nQuarter of 80 is 20 miles. Again, the same answer.\n\nOkay, so all these methods point to 20 miles. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is the train accelerating or decelerating? The problem says it's traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour, which suggests it's moving at a constant speed. So, I don't need to account for acceleration.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correctly handled. I converted minutes to hours correctly, and everything seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to approach this. Maybe using dimensional analysis. Speed is in miles per hour, time is in hours, so multiplying them gives miles, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to convert everything to smaller units, say seconds and feet, but that seems unnecessary for this problem. But just for practice, let's try that.\n\nFirst, convert 80 miles per hour to feet per second.\n\nThere are 5280 feet in a mile, so 80 miles is 80 \u00d7 5280 = 422,400 feet per hour.\n\nThere are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 minutes \u00d7 60 seconds), so 422,400 feet per 3600 seconds, which is 116.666... feet per second.\n\nNow, 15 minutes is 15 \u00d7 60 = 900 seconds.\n\nSo, distance = 116.666... feet per second \u00d7 900 seconds = 105,000 feet.\n\nNow, convert feet back to miles: 105,000 feet divided by 5280 feet per mile is approximately 19.88 miles, which rounds to 20 miles. Again, the same answer.\n\nThis is assuring. It seems no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 20 miles.\n\nLet me think if there's any possibility that the answer could be different. For example, if the train wasn't moving at a constant speed, but the problem states it's traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour, implying constant speed.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any need to account for things like the length of the train, but since we're talking about the distance traveled by the train, and not considering any specific points on the train, I think it's unnecessary.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes, questions like this might be testing understanding of average speed, but in this case, it's given as a constant speed.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here. All methods lead to the same conclusion that the train will travel 20 miles in 15 minutes.\n\nSo, my final answer is 20 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
