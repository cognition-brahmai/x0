        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a simple command-line calculator in Python that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll use functions for each operation to keep the code organized and modular.\n\nFirst, we need to define the functions for each operation:\n\n1. **Addition**: This function will take two numbers and return their sum.\n2. **Subtraction**: This function will take two numbers and return the difference.\n3. **Multiplication**: This function will take two numbers and return their product.\n4. **Division**: This function will take two numbers and return the quotient. We also need to handle the case where the denominator is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nNext, we'll create a main function that will handle user input and call the appropriate operation based on the user's choice.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the operation functions**:\n    - `add(a, b)`: Returns `a + b`.\n    - `subtract(a, b)`: Returns `a - b`.\n    - `multiply(a, b)`: Returns `a * b`.\n    - `divide(a, b)`: Returns `a / b` if `b != 0`, else prints an error message.\n\n2. **Create a main function**:\n    - Display a menu to the user listing the available operations.\n    - Prompt the user to select an operation.\n    - Ask the user to input two numbers.\n    - Call the appropriate function based on the user's choice and display the result.\n\n3. **Handle user input**:\n    - Ensure that the operation choice is valid.\n    - Handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values for numbers.\n\n4. **Loop the calculator**:\n    - Allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.\n    - Provide an option to exit the calculator.\n\nLet's start by writing the operation functions.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Python that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we'll define separate functions for each operation and implement a main function to handle user interactions.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Operation Functions**:\n    - `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.\n    - `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference between `a` and `b`.\n    - `multiply(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.\n    - `divide(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, handling division by zero.\n\n2. **Main Function**:\n    - Displays a menu of operations to the user.\n    - Prompts the user to select an operation and input two numbers.\n    - Calls the appropriate operation function based on the user's choice and displays the result.\n    - Allows the user to perform multiple calculations or exit the program.\n\n3. **Input Handling**:\n    - Ensures the operation choice is valid.\n    - Handles non-numeric inputs for numbers gracefully.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef add(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference between a and b.\"\"\"\n    return a - b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return a * b\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of a divided by b, handling division by zero.\"\"\"\n    if b == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        return None\n    return a / b\n\ndef main():\n    operations = {\n        '1': ('Addition', add),\n        '2': ('Subtraction', subtract),\n        '3': ('Multiplication', multiply),\n        '4': ('Division', divide),\n        '5': ('Exit', None)\n    }\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nSimple Calculator\")\n        print(\"1. Addition\")\n        print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n        print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n        print(\"4. Division\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Select an operation (1-5): \")\n\n        if choice in operations:\n            if choice == '5':\n                print(\"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n                break\n\n            operation_name, operation_func = operations[choice]\n\n            try:\n                num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n                num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n                continue\n\n            result = operation_func(num1, num2)\n            if result is not None:\n                print(f\"Result of {operation_name}: {result}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid operation (1-5).\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Operation Functions**: Each function performs a basic arithmetic operation and returns the result.\n- **Main Function**: \n  - Displays a menu of operations.\n  - Handles user input for operation selection and numbers.\n  - Calls the appropriate operation function based on user choice.\n  - Manages invalid inputs and provides an option to exit.\n- **Input Handling**: \n  - Ensures operation choices are valid.\n  - Handles non-numeric inputs for numbers by catching `ValueError`.\n\nThis approach ensures the calculator is user-friendly, handles errors gracefully, and allows for multiple calculations in a single session."
