        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if a spider spins a web that uses 20 meters of silk, how many webs can it spin from a supply of 400 meters of silk? And I need to show my steps.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, the spider uses 20 meters of silk for one web. And it has a total of 400 meters of silk available. I need to find out how many webs it can make with that amount.\n\nThis seems like a division problem to me. I think I need to divide the total amount of silk by the amount used per web. So, 400 meters divided by 20 meters per web.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of webs = total silk / silk per web\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of webs = 400 meters / 20 meters per web\n\nNow, 400 divided by 20. Let's see, 20 times 20 is 400. So, it should be 20 webs.\n\nWait, let me check that. 20 times 20 is indeed 400. So, yes, the spider can spin 20 webs with 400 meters of silk, if each web uses 20 meters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any waste or if the spider uses additional silk for other things. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume that each web exclusively uses 20 meters and that's all.\n\nAlso, I should consider units. Meters are the unit for length, and since both the total silk and the silk per web are in meters, the units cancel out, leaving just a dimensionless number, which makes sense for the number of webs.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using multiplication. Suppose the spider can spin x webs, and each web uses 20 meters, so total silk used is 20x meters. This should equal the total supply of 400 meters.\n\nSo, 20x = 400\n\nThen, solving for x: x = 400 / 20 = 20\n\nAgain, I get 20 webs.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It consistency helps confirm that I'm on the right track.\n\nLet me think if there's any possibility of partial webs. Could the spider spin part of a web with the remaining silk? Well, the problem asks for full webs, I think, so partial webs wouldn't count.\n\nGiven that 20 meters per web divides evenly into 400 meters, there shouldn't be any leftover silk after spinning 20 webs.\n\nJust to double-check: 20 webs times 20 meters per web equals 400 meters. Yes, that matches the total supply.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The spider can spin 20 webs from a supply of 400 meters of silk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
