        "content": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the expected annual revenue from premiums for an insurance company. They have different premium rates based on age, gender, and health status, but in this problem, health status isn't specified differently, so I think we can ignore that for now. They have 100,000 policyholders divided into four groups with different premium rates. Let me see if I can break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 100,000 policyholders in total. The distribution is:\n\n- 40% are males aged 25-34\n\n- 30% are females aged 35-44\n\n- 20% are males aged 45-54\n\n- 10% are females aged 55-64\n\nAnd the premium rates are:\n\n- Males 25-34: $400/year\n\n- Females 35-44: $600/year\n\n- Males 45-54: $800/year\n\n- Females 55-64: $1,200/year\n\nSo, to find the total expected annual revenue, I need to calculate the revenue from each group and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by finding out how many policyholders are in each group.\n\nFirst group: males aged 25-34.\n\n40% of 100,000 is 0.40 * 100,000 = 40,000 policyholders.\n\nSecond group: females aged 35-44.\n\n30% of 100,000 is 0.30 * 100,000 = 30,000 policyholders.\n\nThird group: males aged 45-54.\n\n20% of 100,000 is 0.20 * 100,000 = 20,000 policyholders.\n\nFourth group: females aged 55-64.\n\n10% of 100,000 is 0.10 * 100,000 = 10,000 policyholders.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the revenue from each group.\n\nFirst group: 40,000 policyholders paying $400 each.\n\nRevenue = 40,000 * 400 = 16,000,000 dollars.\n\nSecond group: 30,000 policyholders paying $600 each.\n\nRevenue = 30,000 * 600 = 18,000,000 dollars.\n\nThird group: 20,000 policyholders paying $800 each.\n\nRevenue = 20,000 * 800 = 16,000,000 dollars.\n\nFourth group: 10,000 policyholders paying $1,200 each.\n\nRevenue = 10,000 * 1,200 = 12,000,000 dollars.\n\nNow, I'll add up all these revenues to get the total expected annual revenue.\n\nTotal revenue = 16,000,000 + 18,000,000 + 16,000,000 + 12,000,000.\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n16,000,000 + 18,000,000 = 34,000,000\n\n34,000,000 + 16,000,000 = 50,000,000\n\n50,000,000 + 12,000,000 = 62,000,000\n\nSo, the total expected annual revenue from premiums is $62,000,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst group: 40,000 * 400 = 16,000,000. That seems right.\n\nSecond group: 30,000 * 600 = 18,000,000. That's correct.\n\nThird group: 20,000 * 800 = 16,000,000. Correct.\n\nFourth group: 10,000 * 1,200 = 12,000,000. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 16 + 18 = 34, then 34 + 16 = 50, and 50 + 12 = 62. So, $62,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of percentages and rates.\n\nTotal revenue = (40% * 100,000 * 400) + (30% * 100,000 * 600) + (20% * 100,000 * 800) + (10% * 100,000 * 1,200)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n(0.40 * 100,000 * 400) + (0.30 * 100,000 * 600) + (0.20 * 100,000 * 800) + (0.10 * 100,000 * 1,200)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n0.40 * 100,000 = 40,000, then 40,000 * 400 = 16,000,000\n\n0.30 * 100,000 = 30,000, then 30,000 * 600 = 18,000,000\n\n0.20 * 100,000 = 20,000, then 20,000 * 800 = 16,000,000\n\n0.10 * 100,000 = 10,000, then 10,000 * 1,200 = 12,000,000\n\nAdding them up again gives $62,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average premium per policyholder and multiply by the total number of policyholders.\n\nFirst, find the weighted average premium.\n\nAverage premium = (40% * 400) + (30% * 600) + (20% * 800) + (10% * 1,200)\n\n= (0.40 * 400) + (0.30 * 600) + (0.20 * 800) + (0.10 * 1,200)\n\n= 160 + 180 + 160 + 120\n\n= 620\n\nSo, the average premium per policyholder is $620.\n\nThen, total revenue = 100,000 * 620 = 62,000,000.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, which is a good sign.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the premium rates and the percentage of policyholders in each group.\n\nSo, for males 25-34: 40% of policyholders pay $400, contributing 40% * 400 = $160 to the average premium.\n\nFemales 35-44: 30% * 600 = $180\n\nMales 45-54: 20% * 800 = $160\n\nFemales 55-64: 10% * 1,200 = $120\n\nAdding these up: 160 + 180 + 160 + 120 = $620 average premium per policyholder.\n\nThen, total revenue is 100,000 * 620 = $62,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the total revenue should be the sum of all individual premiums, which is what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think this is solid. I've cross-verified the calculation using different methods, and both approaches give me the same total revenue of $62,000,000.\n\nSo, the expected annual revenue from premiums is $62,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62000000} \\]"
