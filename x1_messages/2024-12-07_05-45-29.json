        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a cube-shaped box with an edge length of 10 cm, and we need to fill it with smaller cubes that have edge lengths of 2 cm. The question is, how many small cubes can fit into the box?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dimensions involved. The big cube has each side measuring 10 cm, and the small cubes have each side measuring 2 cm. Since all sides of a cube are equal, this should make the calculation straightforward.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider how many small cubes can fit along one edge of the big cube. Since the big cube's edge is 10 cm and each small cube is 2 cm, I can divide 10 by 2 to get 5. So, along one edge, 5 small cubes can fit.\n\nBut a cube has three dimensions: length, width, and height. So, I need to fit small cubes along each of these dimensions. If along each edge, 5 small cubes fit, then in three dimensions, the total number of small cubes should be 5 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 5, which is 125.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. The volume of the big cube is 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm, which is 1000 cubic cm. The volume of one small cube is 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm, which is 8 cubic cm. If I divide the volume of the big cube by the volume of a small cube, I get 1000 divided by 8, which is 125. That matches my previous calculation.\n\nHmm, two different methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring. But let's explore if there's yet another way to think about it, just to be thorough.\n\nSuppose I consider the big cube as a 3D grid where each grid cell is the size of a small cube. Since each edge of the big cube can fit 5 small cubes, the grid would be 5 by 5 by 5, which again gives me 125 small cubes.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to visualize placing the small cubes inside the big one. Starting from one corner, I place a small cube, then next to it, and so on, until I fill up the entire big cube. If I go layer by layer, each layer would have 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 small cubes, and since there are 5 layers (because the height is also divided into 5 parts), total cubes would be 25 \u00d7 5 = 125.\n\nI think I'm getting consistent results with different approaches, which suggests that 125 is the correct answer. But to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there could be any overlapping or empty spaces that might affect the count.\n\nSince both the big cube and the small cubes have dimensions that are multiples of each other (10 cm and 2 cm), there shouldn't be any leftover space. 10 divided by 2 is exactly 5, with no remainder. So, all small cubes should fit perfectly without any gaps or overlaps.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's consider if the small cubes are placed diagonally or in some other orientation that might affect the count. But since cubes are symmetrical and the big cube's interior is also cubic, there's no benefit to placing small cubes diagonally; they fit perfectly aligned with the big cube's edges.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the small cubes can be cut or broken to fit into any remaining spaces, but the problem doesn't mention anything about cutting cubes, and given that the dimensions fit perfectly, there shouldn't be any need to do so.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm not missing any constraints or specifics in the problem statement. The question says the box is cube-shaped with an edge length of 10 cm, and the small cubes have edge lengths of 2 cm. It asks how many small cubes fit into the box. Seems straightforward.\n\nJust to cover all bases, let's think about the surface area. The surface area of the big cube is 6 faces \u00d7 (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) = 600 square cm. The surface area of one small cube is 6 faces \u00d7 (2 cm \u00d7 2 cm) = 24 square cm. But I'm not sure if surface area is relevant here, since we're dealing with volume and fitting small cubes inside the big one.\n\nWait, perhaps considering surface area could be misleading. For example, if I were to pack spheres inside a cube, surface area might play a role, but since we're dealing with cubes, the packing is perfect, and surface area isn't directly relevant.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any mathematical formula that directly applies to this situation. In packing problems, sometimes there are formulas based on the ratio of volumes or other parameters. In this case, since the small cubes are all identical and the big cube is perfectly divisible by the small cubes, the formula is simply the ratio of the volumes, which we've already calculated as 125.\n\nI should also think about whether this is a hypothetical question or if there's any real-world consideration, like the thickness of the box walls or the need for small gaps between cubes. But the problem presents the box as cube-shaped with edge length 10 cm, and small cubes with edge length 2 cm, so I think it's safe to assume that the box's interior is exactly 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm, and the small cubes are 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm, fitting perfectly inside.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, let's consider if the box had a different shape or if the small cubes were not cubes but some other shape, but in this case, both are cubes, so the packing is straightforward.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here. Multiple approaches lead to the same conclusion that 125 small cubes can fit into the big cube-shaped box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
