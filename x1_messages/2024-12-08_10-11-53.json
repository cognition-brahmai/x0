        "content": "So I have this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden that measures 15 feet by 20 feet, and there's going to be an additional gate that's 3 feet wide. I need to figure out how many linear feet of fencing I'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by calculating the perimeter of the garden since the fence is going around the entire thing. For a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all the sides. So, for a rectangle that's 15 feet by 20 feet, the two shorter sides are 15 feet each, and the two longer sides are 20 feet each.\n\nSo, the perimeter P would be:\n\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nP = 2 * (20 + 15)\n\nP = 2 * 35\n\nP = 70 feet\n\nThat's the total length of the fence without considering the gate.\n\nNow, there's a gate that's 3 feet wide. I need to think about how this affects the total fencing needed. Is the gate part of the fence, or is it replacing a section of the fence?\n\nI think the gate is a part of the fence, meaning that the fencing will have a 3-foot-wide gate incorporated into it. So, the total fencing needed would still be the perimeter of the garden, but I need to make sure that the gate is included in that total.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to subtract the width of the gate from the total perimeter because the gate is where the fence is open, so you don't need fencing there. But that doesn't make sense because even though it's a gate, you still need fencing on either side to support the gate.\n\nActually, in fencing, when you have a gate, you still need fencing posts and rails on both sides of the gate. So, the total linear feet of fencing would still be the same as the perimeter, including the gate.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the gate is an additional piece that needs to be accounted for separately.\n\nLet me try another approach. If the garden is 15 by 20 feet, the perimeter is 70 feet as I calculated earlier. If the gate is 3 feet wide, and it's part of the fence, then the total fencing needed would still be 70 feet, regardless of the gate's width, because the gate is just a section of the fence that opens.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is in addition to the perimeter, meaning that the garden has an entrance with a gate that protrudes or something, then maybe I need to add the width of the gate to the total fencing.\n\nBut that doesn't sound right. Typically, when you have a gate, it's incorporated into the fence, replacing a section of the fence with swing hinges and hardware.\n\nSo, in that case, the total linear feet of fencing would still be the same as the perimeter, 70 feet, regardless of the gate's width.\n\nWait, but perhaps the gate is separate, meaning that in addition to the perimeter fence, there is a gate that needs to be built, which is 3 feet wide, and it might require additional fencing material.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nImagine a rectangular garden, 15 feet by 20 feet. You're going to build a fence around it. Now, at one side, you want to have a gate that is 3 feet wide. The gate will likely have hinges and perhaps a latch, but the fencing material around the gate still needs to be there to support the gate.\n\nSo, in reality, the total linear feet of fencing would still be the perimeter of the garden, which is 70 feet, because the gate is just a part of the fence that opens.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the gate is made from the fencing material itself, so you still need fencing along that 3-foot section, just with hinges and hardware to allow it to open.\n\nTherefore, the total linear feet of fencing required is still 70 feet.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider that the gate might require additional fencing on either side to support it. For example, you might need an extra post or something on either side of the gate.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps there is some additional fencing material needed beyond the perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gate is in addition to the perimeter fencing, meaning that you have the perimeter fence and then a separate gate that is attached to it.\n\nIn that case, you might need to add the width of the gate to the total fencing.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because the gate is part of the fence.\n\nI think the most straightforward approach is to consider the total fencing needed as the perimeter of the garden, which is 70 feet, and include the gate within that total.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 70 linear feet of fencing.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose the gate is a separate piece that is attached to the fence, and it has its own framing or something. In that case, maybe there is additional fencing material needed for the gate itself.\n\nHowever, typically, the gate is constructed using the same fencing material as the rest of the fence, so the width of the gate is already accounted for in the perimeter measurement.\n\nGiven that, I believe the total linear feet of fencing required is 70 feet.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider the components:\n\n- Two sides of 15 feet each: 15 * 2 = 30 feet\n\n- Two sides of 20 feet each: 20 * 2 = 40 feet\n\n- Total perimeter: 30 + 40 = 70 feet\n\n- Gate is 3 feet wide, but it's part of one of the sides, so no addition or subtraction is needed.\n\nTherefore, the total linear feet of fencing required is 70 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate requires additional fencing on either side, perhaps for supports, then there might be a little bit more fencing needed.\n\nBut in standard fencing practices, the gate is incorporated into the existing fence, so no extra fencing is required beyond the perimeter.\n\nHence, the answer remains 70 linear feet.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider the following:\n\nIf the gate is 3 feet wide, and it's part of the 20-foot side, for example, then the fencing on that side would be (20 - 3) feet plus the gate itself, which is 3 feet, so it still adds up to 20 feet.\n\nTherefore, the total fencing is still 70 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the gate is installed in one of the 20-foot sides, replacing 3 feet of that side with a gate, then the fencing needed for that side would be (20 - 3) feet plus the gate.\n\nBut since the gate itself has a width of 3 feet, the total for that side remains 20 feet.\n\nTherefore, the total linear feet of fencing required is still 70 feet.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
