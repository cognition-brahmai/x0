The full name is \"Liberty Enlightening the World,\" and it was indeed a gift from France to the United States, commemorating the centennial of American independence.\n\nThe statue was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi, and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel, who is also famous for the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It was dedicated on October 28, 1886, and has since become a symbol of freedom and democracy, as well as a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving in the U.S.\n\nThe statue depicts Liberty as a robed woman holding a torch in her right hand and a tablet in her left, with the date of the American Declaration of Independence inscribed on it. At her feet lies a broken chain, symbolizing freedom from oppression.\n\nOver the years, the Statue of Liberty has undergone several restorations to maintain its structural integrity and appearance. The most significant restoration project was completed in time for its centennial celebration in 1986.\n\nToday, the statue is part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, which includes Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island, site of the former immigration station. Visitors can tour the statue and gain insight into its history and significance.\n\nIt's fascinating how this monument has come to represent so much \u2013 not just American ideals, but also the global aspirations for liberty and opportunity. It's a powerful symbol that continues to inspire people around the world.\n\n**Fun Fact:** The Statue of Liberty's face is said to be modeled after Bartholdi's mother, Charlotte Bartholdi."
