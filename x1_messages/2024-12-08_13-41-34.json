        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 houses in total, and each house has either a blue or a red door. When you count the number of houses with blue doors from left to right, you get 10. Similarly, when you count the number of houses with red doors from right to left, you also get 10.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to count blue doors from left to right and red doors from right to left.\n\nLet's assume that the houses are arranged in a straight line, numbered from 1 to 20, say, from left to right.\n\nSo, house 1 is the leftmost, and house 20 is the rightmost.\n\nNow, counting blue doors from left to right up to 10 means that the first 10 houses have blue doors.\n\nSimilarly, counting red doors from right to left up to 10 means that the last 10 houses have red doors.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right because if the first 10 houses have blue doors and the last 10 have red doors, then houses 11 to 20 have red doors, and houses 1 to 10 have blue doors. That would mean that houses 11 to 20 have red doors, and houses 1 to 10 have blue doors, with no overlap.\n\nBut in that case, the total number of blue doors would be 10, and red doors would also be 10.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many houses have blue doors.\n\nFrom this arrangement, it seems like there are 10 houses with blue doors.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's some overlap or something I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nLet's denote B for blue doors and R for red doors.\n\nSo, we have a sequence of 20 houses: position 1 to 20.\n\nGiven that counting blue doors from left to right up to 10 means that the first 10 houses have blue doors.\n\nSimilarly, counting red doors from right to left up to 10 means that the last 10 houses have red doors.\n\nSo, positions 1 to 10: B\n\nPositions 11 to 20: R\n\nTherefore, total blue doors are 10.\n\nBut the question seems too straightforward for that. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the counting doesn't mean that the first 10 houses have blue doors, but that the number of blue doors among the first n houses from the left is 10 for some n.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"If you count the number of houses with blue doors from left to right, you get 10.\"\n\nSimilarly, \"If you count the number of houses with red doors from right to left, you get 10.\"\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me rephrase it.\n\nThe number of houses with blue doors encountered when counting from left to right is 10.\n\nSimilarly, the number of houses with red doors encountered when counting from right to left is 10.\n\nDoes that necessarily mean that the first 10 houses have blue doors and the last 10 have red doors?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an overlap in the counting.\n\nLet me consider that the total number of blue doors is b, and red doors is r, with b + r = 20.\n\nGiven that counting blue doors from left to right gives 10, and red doors from right to left gives 10.\n\nPerhaps this means that the number of blue doors in the first k houses from the left is 10, and the number of red doors in the last m houses from the right is 10.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose we have 20 houses in a row.\n\nLet's denote the door colors as a sequence: d1, d2, ..., d20, where each di is either B or R.\n\nNow, counting blue doors from left to right gives 10, which means that the cumulative count of B from position 1 to some position n is 10.\n\nSimilarly, counting red doors from right to left gives 10, which means that the cumulative count of R from position 20 down to some position m is 10.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it means that the total number of blue doors is 10, and the total number of red doors is 10.\n\nBecause if you count blue doors from left to right, you'll eventually count up to 10, and similarly for red doors from right to left.\n\nIn that case, total blue doors are 10, and red doors are also 10.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to the position where the count reaches 10.\n\nFor example, when counting blue doors from left to right, the 10th blue door is at a certain position, and similarly, the 10th red door from the right is at another position.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider an example.\n\nSuppose houses 1 to 10 have blue doors, and houses 11 to 20 have red doors.\n\nThen, counting blue doors from left to right, you'd reach 10 at house 10.\n\nCounting red doors from right to left, you'd reach 10 at house 11.\n\nWait, no, from right to left, house 20 is the first red door, house 19 is the second, ..., house 11 is the 10th.\n\nSo, you'd count 10 red doors from house 20 down to house 11.\n\nThus, in this arrangement, total blue doors are 10, and red doors are 10.\n\nAlternatively, suppose there are more blue doors.\n\nFor example, suppose houses 1 to 11 have blue doors, and houses 12 to 20 have red doors.\n\nThen, counting blue doors from left to right, you'd reach 11 at house 11.\n\nBut the problem says you get 10, not 11.\n\nSo, that can't be.\n\nSimilarly, if houses 1 to 9 have blue doors and houses 10 to 20 have red doors, then counting blue doors from left to right gives 9, which is less than 10.\n\nSo, that doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the only arrangement that satisfies both conditions is houses 1 to 10 have blue doors, and houses 11 to 20 have red doors.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses with blue doors is 10.\n\nWait, but perhaps there is another way.\n\nSuppose there are some houses with blue doors in the middle.\n\nFor example, houses 5 to 14 have blue doors, and the rest have red doors.\n\nThen, counting from left to right, blue doors start at house 5.\n\nHouse 5: B, house 6: B, ..., house 14: B.\n\nSo, from left to right, blue doors are from house 5 to 14, which is 10 houses.\n\nFrom right to left, counting red doors: house 20: R, house 19: R, ..., house 15: R, house 14: B, ..., house 5: B.\n\nWait, in this case, counting red doors from right to left, you'd count house 20: R (1), house 19: R (2), ..., house 15: R (6).\n\nThen house 14: B, which is not red, so you stop at 6 red doors.\n\nBut the problem says you get 10 red doors when counting from right to left.\n\nTherefore, this arrangement doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nHence, the only arrangement that satisfies both conditions is houses 1 to 10 have blue doors, and houses 11 to 20 have red doors.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses with blue doors is 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is overlapping of blue and red doors in some houses.\n\nBut the problem states that each house has either blue or red doors, not both.\n\nSo, no overlap is possible.\n\nHence, the answer should be 10 houses have blue doors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
