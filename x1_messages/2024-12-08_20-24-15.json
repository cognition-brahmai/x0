        "content": "Let's see. If a bacteria population doubles every 3 hours, and we want to know how many times it will double in one day, we need to figure out how many 3-hour periods there are in 24 hours.\n\nFirst, I know that one day has 24 hours. So, if the bacteria double every 3 hours, we can divide the total number of hours in a day by the doubling time to find out how many times it doubles.\n\nSo, 24 hours divided by 3 hours per doubling. That should be 24 divided by 3, which is 8. So, it doubles 8 times in one day.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. If it doubles every 3 hours, starting from time zero, then at t=3 hours it doubles once, at t=6 hours it doubles twice, and so on, up to t=24 hours.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n- t=0: initial population\n\n- t=3 hours: first doubling\n\n- t=6 hours: second doubling\n\n- t=9 hours: third doubling\n\n- t=12 hours: fourth doubling\n\n- t=15 hours: fifth doubling\n\n- t=18 hours: sixth doubling\n\n- t=21 hours: seventh doubling\n\n- t=24 hours: eighth doubling\n\nSo, yes, it doubles 8 times in one day.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of exponential growth. The population at any time t is P(t) = P0 * 2^(t/3), where P0 is the initial population, and t is in hours.\n\nIn one day, t=24 hours, so P(24) = P0 * 2^(24/3) = P0 * 2^8.\n\nSo, the population is 2^8 times the initial population, which means it has doubled 8 times.\n\nWait, but exponents can be a bit tricky. Let me confirm.\n\nIf it doubles once, it's 2^1 = 2 times the initial population.\n\nIf it doubles twice, it's 2^2 = 4 times the initial population.\n\nSo, after n doublings, it's 2^n times the initial population.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that in 24 hours it's 2^8 times the initial population, that means it has doubled 8 times.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the growth factor. If it doubles every 3 hours, the growth factor is 2 every 3 hours.\n\nIn 24 hours, there are 24/3 = 8 periods.\n\nSo, the total growth factor is 2^8.\n\nTherefore, it doubles 8 times in one day.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
