        "content": "So the car factory makes 120 cars every day, and each car needs 4 tires. We want to know how many tires the factory should have in stock to keep making cars for 15 days without running out.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many tires are used each day. Since each car needs 4 tires, and they make 120 cars a day, I can multiply the number of cars by the number of tires per car to find the daily tire usage.\n\nSo, 120 cars/day \u00d7 4 tires/car = 480 tires/day.\n\nThat means the factory uses 480 tires every day.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many tires are needed for 15 days. To do that, I'll multiply the daily tire usage by the number of days.\n\n480 tires/day \u00d7 15 days = 7,200 tires.\n\nSo, the factory needs to have 7,200 tires in stock to keep producing cars for 15 days.\n\nBut, just to be sure, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by calculating the total number of cars produced in 15 days first, and then multiplying by the number of tires per car.\n\nLet's see: 120 cars/day \u00d7 15 days = 1,800 cars.\n\nThen, 1,800 cars \u00d7 4 tires/car = 7,200 tires.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it seems like 7,200 tires is the correct amount needed for 15 days of production.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the factory has some tires already in stock? Should I assume that the factory starts with zero tires in stock, or do they already have some tires available?\n\nThe question doesn't specify whether there are any tires already in stock, so I think it's safe to assume that we're calculating the additional tires needed for the next 15 days, assuming no tires are currently in stock.\n\nHowever, in reality, factories usually have some inventory buffer. But since the question doesn't mention that, I'll proceed with the assumption that the factory needs to have 7,200 tires in stock for 15 days of production.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all the tires are the same type or if there are different types for different car models. But again, the question doesn't provide any information about different types of tires, so I'll assume that all tires are identical.\n\nAlso, perhaps the factory has a policy of keeping some extra tires for replacements or maintenance purposes. But without specific information about that, I won't factor it into the calculation.\n\nSo, sticking to the given data: 120 cars per day, each car needs 4 tires, and we're looking at 15 days of production.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 7,200 tires in stock.\n\nBut let me double-check the math to be absolutely sure.\n\n120 cars/day \u00d7 4 tires/car = 480 tires/day.\n\n480 tires/day \u00d7 15 days = 7,200 tires.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, as I did earlier, 120 cars/day \u00d7 15 days = 1,800 cars.\n\n1,800 cars \u00d7 4 tires/car = 7,200 tires.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I can confidently say that the factory needs to have 7,200 tires in stock for 15 days of production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7200} \\]"
