        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field with an area of 300 square meters, and the farmer wants to build a fence around it using exactly 80 meters of fencing material. We need to find the dimensions of the field.\n\nFirst, let's recall the properties of a rectangle. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides: the length and the width. Let's denote the length by \\(L\\) and the width by \\(W\\).\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The area of the rectangle is 300 square meters.\n\n2. The perimeter of the rectangle is 80 meters.\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[A = L \\times W\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[L \\times W = 300\\]\n\nThe perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[P = 2L + 2W\\]\n\nOr simplified:\n\n\\[P = 2(L + W)\\]\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 80 meters, we can write:\n\n\\[2(L + W) = 80\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[L + W = 40\\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\(L \\times W = 300\\)\n\n2. \\(L + W = 40\\)\n\nWe need to solve for \\(L\\) and \\(W\\).\n\nOne way to solve this is to express one variable in terms of the other using one equation and substitute into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the second equation for \\(L\\):\n\n\\[L = 40 - W\\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\(L\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[(40 - W) \\times W = 300\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[40W - W^2 = 300\\]\n\nLet's rearrange this equation to standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[-W^2 + 40W - 300 = 0\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\n\\[W^2 - 40W + 300 = 0\\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[W^2 - 40W + 300 = 0\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[W = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nIn this equation, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -40\\), and \\(c = 300\\). Plugging these values in:\n\n\\[W = \\frac{40 \\pm \\sqrt{(-40)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 300}}{2 \\times 1}\\]\n\n\\[W = \\frac{40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 - 1200}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[W = \\frac{40 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[W = \\frac{40 \\pm 20}{2}\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for \\(W\\):\n\n1. \\(W = \\frac{40 + 20}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\\)\n\n2. \\(W = \\frac{40 - 20}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\\)\n\nSo, the width \\(W\\) can be either 30 meters or 10 meters.\n\nNow, using the equation \\(L = 40 - W\\), we can find the corresponding lengths:\n\n1. If \\(W = 30\\), then \\(L = 40 - 30 = 10\\)\n\n2. If \\(W = 10\\), then \\(L = 40 - 10 = 30\\)\n\nInteresting, so in one case, the length is 30 meters and the width is 10 meters, and in the other case, it's the opposite: length is 10 meters and width is 30 meters.\n\nBut in reality, length and width are just conventions, and in a rectangle, they are interchangeable. So, essentially, the dimensions of the field are 30 meters by 10 meters.\n\nLet's double-check to ensure these dimensions satisfy both the area and the perimeter requirements.\n\nFirst, check the area:\n\n\\[L \\times W = 30 \\times 10 = 300\\, \\text{square meters}\\]\n\nThat matches the given area.\n\nNext, check the perimeter:\n\n\\[2(L + W) = 2(30 + 10) = 2 \\times 40 = 80\\, \\text{meters}\\]\n\nThat matches the given perimeter.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the field are 30 meters by 10 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using calculus or some other method?\n\nWell, since this seems like a standard algebra problem, the method we used is straightforward and sufficient. However, for the sake of exploration, let's consider using calculus to minimize or maximize one of the variables.\n\nBut in this case, we're not asked to maximize or minimize anything; we're just given the area and perimeter, and we need to find the dimensions that satisfy both conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of optimization to confirm that these dimensions are the only ones that satisfy both conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the area is fixed at 300 square meters, and we want to see what dimensions give us that area with the given perimeter.\n\nWait, actually, in this problem, there are exactly two variables, and we have two equations, so the system is determined, and there should be a unique solution, which we've found.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be other solutions.\n\nSuppose we have another shape with the same perimeter and area. For example, if the field weren't rectangular, but perhaps another quadrilateral or a different shape altogether.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the field is rectangular, so we don't need to consider other shapes.\n\nMoreover, in a rectangle, the dimensions are uniquely determined by the area and the perimeter, as we've just calculated.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of mistakes in our calculations.\n\nStarting from the equations:\n\n1. \\(L \\times W = 300\\)\n\n2. \\(L + W = 40\\)\n\nWe solved the second equation for \\(L\\) and substituted into the first equation, leading to a quadratic equation in terms of \\(W\\), which we solved to find \\(W = 30\\) or \\(W = 10\\), with corresponding \\(L\\) values.\n\nEverything seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for a given perimeter, the rectangle with the maximum area is a square. In this case, if it were a square, each side would be \\(20\\) meters, giving an area of \\(400\\) square meters. But our area is \\(300\\) square meters, which is less than \\(400\\), so the dimensions cannot be a square, which aligns with our earlier finding of \\(10\\) meters and \\(30\\) meters.\n\nFurthermore, we can think about the relationship between the area and the perimeter. The perimeter is fixed at \\(80\\) meters, which for a rectangle, allows various area values, but in this case, we're given a specific area, which helps us pin down the exact dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to consider the aspect ratio of the rectangle, which is the ratio of length to width, we could express \\(L = k \\times W\\), where \\(k\\) is the aspect ratio. However, since we don't know \\(k\\), this approach wouldn't be helpful here.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given area and perimeter, the dimensions of the rectangular field are \\(30\\) meters by \\(10\\) meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ meters by } 10 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
