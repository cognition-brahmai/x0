It's often referred to as the \"City of Canals\" or \"City of Water\" due to its unique system of navigable channels and bridges that crisscross the city. Gondolas, the traditional flat-bottomed rowboats, are a iconic mode of transportation in Venice, offering a romantic and serene way to explore the city's waterways."
