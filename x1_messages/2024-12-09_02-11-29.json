        "content": "Let's see. The store wants to sell a product that originally costs $200 at a discounted price of $150. I need to find out what percentage discount that represents.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much the discount amount is. That would be the original price minus the final price. So, $200 minus $150 equals $50. So, the discount amount is $50.\n\nNow, to find out what percentage $50 is of the original $200, I can set up a percentage equation. The formula for percentage discount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Discount Amount}}{\\text{Original Price}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{50}{200} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{200} = 0.25\n\\]\n\nThen, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 100 = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the store should apply a 25% discount to reach the final price of $150.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I take 25% off of $200, does that bring it down to $150?\n\nFirst, calculate 25% of $200:\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 200 = 50\n\\]\n\nThen, subtract the discount from the original price:\n\n\\[\n200 - 50 = 150\n\\]\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the answer is indeed a 25% discount.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about what percentage of the original price the final price represents and then find the discount from there. Let's try that approach.\n\nIf the final price is $150 and the original price is $200, then $150 is what percentage of $200?\n\nUsing the percentage formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Part}}{\\text{Whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{150}{200} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.75 \\times 100 = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nThis means that $150 is 75% of the original price. Therefore, the discount is 100% - 75% = 25%.\n\nAgain, that confirms the discount is 25%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use proportions. If $200 is 100%, and $150 is 75%, then the discount is 25%. But I already did that.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if the discount is applied differently, but in standard percentage discount calculations, it's straightforward like this.\n\nSo, the store should apply a 25% discount to the product to sell it at $150.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\%} \\]"
