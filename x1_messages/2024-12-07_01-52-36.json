        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A in 5 hours. So, if I want to find out how long it will take to produce 3000 units at the same production rate, I need to first figure out the rate of production per hour.\n\nSo, production rate is units per hour. If 500 units are produced in 5 hours, then the rate is 500 units divided by 5 hours, which is 100 units per hour.\n\nNow, if the factory produces 100 units every hour, how many hours will it take to produce 3000 units?\n\nWell, time equals the total number of units divided by the production rate. So, time = 3000 units / 100 units per hour = 30 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions or something like that.\n\nLet's try that. If 500 units take 5 hours, then 3000 units will take x hours. So, we can set up a proportion:\n\n500 units / 5 hours = 3000 units / x hours\n\nNow, cross-multiplying: 500 * x = 3000 * 5\n\nSo, 500x = 15000\n\nNow, solving for x: x = 15000 / 500 = 30 hours.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 30 hours.\n\nBut let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Is the production rate constant? The problem says yes. Are there any breaks or downtime in the factory? The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume the factory runs continuously at the same rate.\n\nSo, the answer should be 30 hours.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the factory works in shifts or if there are any limitations on working hours. But again, the problem doesn't provide that information, so I'll stick with the assumption that the production is constant without interruptions.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many batches of 500 units are there in 3000 units. 3000 divided by 500 is 6. So, it's 6 batches. If each batch takes 5 hours, then 6 batches would take 6 times 5 hours, which is 30 hours.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nLet me just double-check the math to be sure.\n\nFirst method:\n\nProduction rate = 500 units / 5 hours = 100 units per hour\n\nTime for 3000 units = 3000 units / 100 units per hour = 30 hours\n\nSecond method:\n\nProportion: 500/5 = 3000/x\n\nCross-multiplying: 500x = 15000\n\nx = 15000 / 500 = 30 hours\n\nThird method:\n\nNumber of batches: 3000 / 500 = 6\n\nTime per batch: 5 hours\n\nTotal time: 6 * 5 = 30 hours\n\nAll three methods give the same answer, so it must be correct.\n\nTherefore, it will take 30 hours to produce 3000 units if the production rate remains constant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
