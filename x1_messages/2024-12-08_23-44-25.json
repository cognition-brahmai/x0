Let me try to make it more creative.\n\nIn a place called Tenet Bay,\nLived a man named Bob, day by day.\nHe'd race cars in a civic race,\nWith his pal, who had a civic grace.\n\nWait, that's not working. Maybe I should focus on the structure of a limerick and incorporate the palindromes more naturally.\n\nThere once was a level-headed man,\nWho lived in a town called Tenet's land.\nHe'd often say, \"Madam, I'm Adam,\"\nAs he played with his civic band.\n\nHmm, still not perfect. Let's try another approach.\n\nIn a town where deeds were deeds,\nLived a man with level-headed needs.\nHe'd often say, \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!\",\nThough it didn't make much sense, it was his jam.\n\nWait, that's getting a bit too casual. Let's stick to the traditional limerick structure.\n\nThere once was a level man from Tenet,\nWho loved to play with his civic set.\nHe'd say, \"Madam, in Eden I'm Adam,\"\nAs he played his guitar, oh so sweet.\n\nStill not there. Maybe I need to focus on the rhyme and rhythm more carefully.\n\nIn a town called Tenet, so neat,\nLived a man who was always level-headed, it's meet.\nHe'd play with his civic group, so keen,\nAnd often he'd say, \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!\", extreme.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try using different palindromes.\n\nThere once was a level man from Ada,\nWho loved to play with his civic brigade.\nHe'd say, \"Madam, in Panama, I'm Adam.\",\nAs he played his tunes, so serenade.\n\nWait, \"Ada\" is a palindrome, isn't it? Let me check.\n\nAda reversed is Ada, yes, it's a palindrome.\n\nAlright, maybe I should try to make the entire first line a palindrome.\n\nThere once was a level man from Ada,\nA man from Ada, level, so steady.\n\nHmm, that's interesting, but it's not working well.\n\nWait, maybe I should focus on the last word of the first line being a palindrome.\n\nThere once was a man from Ada,\nWho played with his civic band, a.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nPerhaps I should look for different palindromes.\n\nDeed, deed is a palindrome.\n\nThere once was a man with a deed,\nSo pure, it seemed almost creed.\nHe'd say, \"Madam, I'm Adam,\nIn this civic life, I'm not bad.\"\n\nHmm, still not perfect. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me list some palindromes:\n\n- Level\n\n- Deed\n\n- Civic\n\n- Madam\n\n- Radar\n\n-_refer\n\n- Tenet\n\n- Wow\n\n- Eve\n\n- Pop\n\n- Pip\n\n- Solos\n\n- Stats\n\n- Rotator\n\n- Refer\n\n- Kayak\n\n- Racecar\n\nAlright, maybe I can use 'civic', 'level', and 'tenet'.\n\nThere once was a man from Tenet,\n\nWith a car that was truly civic.\n\nHe drove it with skill,\n\nOn roads that were level,\n\nThus, his drives were always politic.\n\nHmm, that's not bad, but 'politic' isn't a palindrome. Maybe I can adjust it.\n\nThere once was a man from Tenet,\n\nWith a car that was truly civic.\n\nHe drove it with skill,\n\nOn roads that were level,\n\nThus, his drives were always riveting.\n\nStill not a palindrome, but it's getting closer.\n\nWait, maybe I can make the last line have a palindrome.\n\nThere once was a man from Tenet,\n\nWith a car that was truly civic.\n\nHe drove it with skill,\n\nOn roads that were level,\n\nThus, his drives were a racecar, so vivid.\n\nHmm, 'racecar' is a palindrome, but it's a bit forced.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThere once was a man from Tenet,\n\nWith a car that was truly civic.\n\nHe drove it with skill,\n\nOn roads that were level,\n\nThus, his drives were a deed, so vivid.\n\n'Deed' is a palindrome. That might work.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThere once was a man so civic,\n\nFrom a town called Tenet, so livid.\n\nHe drove with care,\n\nOn roads very level,\n\nAnd always kept his deed, so vivid.\n\nWait, 'livid' might not be the best word choice here.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIn a town called Tenet, serene,\n\nLived a man who was always so keen.\n\nHe drove his civic,\n\nOn roads so level,\n\nAnd lived life with civic sheen.\n\nHmm, that's okay, but not a traditional limerick structure.\n\nPerhaps I should try using 'level', 'civic', and 'madam'.\n\nThere once was a man so level,\n\nWho owned a car that was civic.\n\nHe'd say to his madam,\n\n\"I love our civic, it's our jam,\n\nOn roads level, we travel, so revel.\"\n\nThat has three palindromes: level, civic, madam.\n\nBut maybe it's a bit too stretched.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThere once was a man so civic,\n\nFrom a town called Tenet, so livid.\n\nHe'd drive his civic,\n\nOn roads so level,\n\nAnd greet folks with \"Madam, I'm Adam.\"\n\nThat incorporates 'civic', 'tenet', and 'madam'.\n\nPerhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThere once was a man so level,\n\nFrom a town called Tenet, so stellar.\n\nHe'd drive his civic,\n\nOn roads so linear,\n\nAnd greet everyone with \"Madam, I'm Adam.\"\n\nThat uses 'level', 'tenet', and 'madam'.\n\nMaybe that's better.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThere once was a man so civic,\n\nFrom a town called Tenet, so quick.\n\nHe'd race in his civic,\n\nOn roads so level, slick,\n\nAnd shout \"Madam, I'm Adam!\" so slick.\n\nThat uses 'civic', 'tenet', and 'madam'.\n\nPerhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nIn a town called Tenet, so quaint,\n\nLived a man who was always so quaint.\n\nHe'd drive his civic,\n\nOn roads so level, civic,\n\nAnd greet folks with \"Madam, I'm Adam,\" so reign.\n\nWait, 'reign' isn't a palindrome.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nIn a town called Tenet, so still,\n\nLived a man who was always so skillful.\n\nHe'd drive his civic,\n\nOn roads so level, civic,\n\nAnd greet folks with \"Madam, I'm Adam,\" so fulfilling.\n\nStill not perfect.\n\nMaybe I need to accept that creating a limerick with three palindromes is challenging and settle for one that's not perfect.\n\nSo, here's my final attempt:\n\nThere once was a man so civic,\n\nFrom a town called Tenet, so livid.\n\nHe'd race in his civic,\n\nOn roads so level, slick,\n\nAnd shout \"Madam, I'm Adam!\" so quick.\n\nThat uses 'civic', 'tenet', and 'madam' as palindromes.\n\n**Final Limerick:**\n\nThere once was a man so civic,\n\nFrom a town called Tenet, so livid.\n\nHe'd race in his civic,\n\nOn roads so level, slick,\n\nAnd shout \"Madam, I'm Adam!\" so quick.\n\n**Palindromes Used:**\n\n1. Civic\n\n2. Tenet\n\n3. Madam"
