        "content": "So I have this problem here about a train traveling from Town A to Town B and then to Town C. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, it says the train goes from Town A to Town B in 4 hours at an average speed of 80 km/h. I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, so the distance from A to B should be 80 km/h times 4 hours, which is 320 kilometers.\n\nThen, it continues to Town C, which is twice as far away from Town B as A is from B. Since A to B is 320 km, then B to C should be twice that, so 640 km.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it takes for the train to go from A to C. That means the total distance from A to C is the sum of A to B and B to C, which is 320 km plus 640 km, totaling 960 km.\n\nAssuming the train maintains the same average speed of 80 km/h for the entire journey, the total time would be the total distance divided by the speed. So, 960 km divided by 80 km/h should give me 12 hours.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if the speed remains the same for the second part of the journey. The problem says it travels from A to B at 80 km/h, but it doesn't specify the speed from B to C. Maybe I should assume it's the same speed unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the speed changes. Let me read the problem again carefully: \"A train travels from Town A to Town B in 4 hours at an average speed of 80 km/h. It then continues its journey to Town C, which is twice as far away from Town B as Town A is from Town B.\"\n\nThere's no mention of the speed changing, so it's probably safe to assume it remains at 80 km/h.\n\nSo, distance A to B: 320 km, time: 4 hours, speed: 80 km/h.\n\nDistance B to C: 640 km, time: ?, speed: 80 km/h.\n\nTime from B to C would be distance divided by speed, so 640 km / 80 km/h = 8 hours.\n\nTherefore, total time from A to C is time from A to B plus time from B to C, which is 4 hours + 8 hours = 12 hours.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me double-check.\n\nTotal distance: 320 km + 640 km = 960 km.\n\nTotal time: 960 km / 80 km/h = 12 hours.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem, but I can't think of any right now. I think the straightforward approach is sufficient here.\n\nSo, the train takes 12 hours to travel from Town A to Town C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
