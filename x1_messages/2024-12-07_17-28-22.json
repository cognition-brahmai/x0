        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a large corporation with 10,000 employees, and they want to improve health and productivity by offering subsidized gym memberships. About 60% of the employees are expected to join this program. Each gym membership costs $50 per month, and the company plans to pay 75% of that cost. We need to find out the annual cost for the company and see if building an on-site fitness center would be more cost-effective. The fitness center would cost $2 million to build and have annual operating expenses of $250,000.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many employees will participate in the program. If there are 10,000 employees and 60% are expected to participate:\n\nNumber of participants = 10,000 * 0.60 = 6,000 employees\n\nNext, the cost per membership is $50 per month, and the company subsidizes 75% of that. So, the company's monthly cost per employee is:\n\nCompany's monthly cost per employee = $50 * 0.75 = $37.50\n\nNow, to find the total monthly cost for all participating employees:\n\nTotal monthly cost = 6,000 * $37.50 = $225,000\n\nTo find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:\n\nAnnual cost of the gym membership program = $225,000 * 12 = $2,700,000\n\nNow, let's look at the on-site fitness center option. The initial construction cost is $2 million, and annual operating expenses are $250,000. Since construction is a one-time cost, we need to consider both the initial investment and the ongoing annual expenses.\n\nTo compare it with the gym membership program, we should consider the total cost over a certain period. Let's assume we're looking at a 5-year period to make a fair comparison.\n\nTotal cost for gym memberships over 5 years:\n\nAnnual cost = $2,700,000\n\nOver 5 years: $2,700,000 * 5 = $13,500,000\n\nFor the on-site fitness center:\n\nInitial construction cost: $2,000,000\n\nAnnual operating expenses: $250,000\n\nOver 5 years: $250,000 * 5 = $1,250,000\n\nTotal cost over 5 years for the fitness center: $2,000,000 + $1,250,000 = $3,250,000\n\nComparing the two options over 5 years:\n\n- Gym memberships: $13,500,000\n\n- On-site fitness center: $3,250,000\n\nThe on-site fitness center seems significantly cheaper over a 5-year period. However, there are other factors to consider:\n\n1. **Employee Satisfaction and Usage:** Building an on-site fitness center might encourage higher participation or provide more convenience, which could lead to better health outcomes and productivity.\n\n2. **Long-term Costs:** The fitness center has a one-time construction cost and ongoing operating expenses. If the facility is well-maintained, it could last for many years beyond the 5-year period.\n\n3. **Capacity and Demand:** The fitness center needs to have enough capacity to accommodate all participating employees. If it's poorly designed or too small, it might not be effective.\n\n4. **Additional Features:** An on-site fitness center could include features like group classes, personalized training, and other amenities that might not be available with external gym memberships.\n\n5. **Real Estate Costs:** The cost of land or space for the fitness center might vary depending on the location of the company's premises.\n\n6. **Maintenance and Upkeep:** There might be additional costs for maintaining equipment and facilities beyond the operating expenses.\n\n7. **Flexibility:** Subsidized gym memberships offer employees the flexibility to choose their preferred gym, which might be important for those who have specific preferences or need to work out outside of office hours.\n\nGiven that the on-site fitness center appears to be more cost-effective over a 5-year period, and potentially even more so in the long run, it seems like a worthwhile investment. However, the company should also consider the qualitative benefits, such as improved employee satisfaction and potentially higher productivity, which might not be fully captured in the cost analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the company could consider a hybrid approach, where they offer both subsidized gym memberships and an on-site fitness center to cater to different employee preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, building an on-site fitness center appears to be more cost-effective compared to subsidizing gym memberships, especially when considering a multi-year period. However, the company should also evaluate the non-financial benefits and ensure that the fitness center meets the needs of its employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Building an on-site fitness center is more cost-effective.}} \\]"
