        "content": "Let's tackle this expression step by step. The expression given is:\n\n(3^2 - 1) * (5 - 2)^3 / 9\n\nFirst, I need to recall the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n\nLet's look at the first parenthesis: (3^2 - 1)\n\nInside this, I have an exponent and a subtraction. According to PEMDAS, exponents come before subtraction.\n\nSo, 3^2 is 9.\n\nThen, 9 - 1 is 8.\n\nSo, the first parenthesis simplifies to 8.\n\nNow, the second parenthesis: (5 - 2)^3\n\nHere, it's subtraction inside the parenthesis followed by an exponent.\n\n5 - 2 is 3.\n\nThen, 3^3 is 27.\n\nSo, the second parenthesis simplifies to 27.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to:\n\n8 * 27 / 9\n\nNext, according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division are performed from left to right.\n\nSo, first, 8 * 27 is 216.\n\nThen, 216 / 9 is 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
