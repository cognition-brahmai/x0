        "content": "So the original garden is rectangular, with a length of 20 meters and a width of 15 meters. The gardener plans to increase the length by 5 meters and decrease the width by 3 meters. We need to find out what the new area of the garden will be after these changes.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for the original garden, the area would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 20 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 15 \\, \\text{meters} = 300 \\, \\text{square meters}\n\\]\n\nBut we're not asked about the original area; we need to find the new area after the changes.\n\nThe gardener is increasing the length by 5 meters. So, the new length will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Length} = \\text{original length} + 5 \\, \\text{meters} = 20 \\, \\text{meters} + 5 \\, \\text{meters} = 25 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nAt the same time, the width is being decreased by 3 meters. So, the new width will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Width} = \\text{original width} - 3 \\, \\text{meters} = 15 \\, \\text{meters} - 3 \\, \\text{meters} = 12 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the new area, we multiply the new length by the new width:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = \\text{new length} \\times \\text{new width} = 25 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 12 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[\n25 \\times 12 = 300 \\, \\text{square meters}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as the original area. Is that possible?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nOriginal area: 20m \u00d7 15m = 300m\u00b2\n\nNew dimensions: length = 20m + 5m = 25m, width = 15m - 3m = 12m\n\nNew area: 25m \u00d7 12m = 300m\u00b2\n\nYes, it's the same. So, even though the length and width have changed, the area remains unchanged at 300 square meters.\n\nI wonder if there's a mathematical reason behind this. Let's see.\n\nThe original area is 20 \u00d7 15 = 300.\n\nThe new area is (20 + 5) \u00d7 (15 - 3) = 25 \u00d7 12 = 300.\n\nSo, (20 + 5) \u00d7 (15 - 3) = 20\u00d715 + 5\u00d715 - 20\u00d73 - 5\u00d73 = 300 + 75 - 60 - 15 = 300 + 75 - 75 = 300.\n\nAh, so the increase in length and decrease in width have offset each other in terms of area. The increase in length adds area, but the decrease in width subtracts an equal amount of area, resulting in no net change.\n\nThat's interesting. So, in this specific case, changing the length and width in this manner keeps the area the same.\n\nPerhaps this is a coincidence of the specific numbers involved. Let's see if this happens with different values.\n\nSuppose we have a rectangle with length l and width w, area a = l \u00d7 w.\n\nIf we increase the length by x and decrease the width by y, the new area a' = (l + x)(w - y) = l\u00d7w + x\u00d7w - l\u00d7y - x\u00d7y.\n\nFor the area to remain the same, a' = a, which implies:\n\nl\u00d7w + x\u00d7w - l\u00d7y - x\u00d7y = l\u00d7w\n\nSimplifying, x\u00d7w - l\u00d7y - x\u00d7y = 0\n\nOr, x\u00d7w = l\u00d7y + x\u00d7y\n\nIn our example, x = 5m, y = 3m, l = 20m, w = 15m.\n\nPlugging in: 5\u00d715 = 20\u00d73 + 5\u00d73 \u2192 75 = 60 + 15 \u2192 75 = 75, which holds true.\n\nSo, in this case, the condition is satisfied, and the area remains unchanged.\n\nBut this might not be true for all values of x and y.\n\nFor example, if we increase the length by 4m and decrease the width by 2m:\n\nx = 4m, y = 2m, l = 20m, w = 15m.\n\nCheck if 4\u00d715 = 20\u00d72 + 4\u00d72 \u2192 60 = 40 + 8 \u2192 60 \u2260 48.\n\nSo, in this case, the areas would not be equal.\n\nTherefore, it's specific to the values given in the problem.\n\nSo, to answer the original question: the new area of the garden will be 300 square meters, the same as the original area.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
