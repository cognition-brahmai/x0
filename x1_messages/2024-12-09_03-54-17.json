        "content": "Let's see. I have a sequence where the first two terms are 3 and 5, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms. So, it's like a Fibonacci sequence but starting with 3 and 5 instead of the usual 0 and 1 or 1 and 1.\n\nOkay, let me list out the terms step by step.\n\nThe first term, let's call it term 1, is 3.\n\nTerm 2 is 5.\n\nNow, term 3 will be the sum of term 1 and term 2, which is 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nTerm 4 will be the sum of term 2 and term 3, which is 5 + 8 = 13.\n\nTerm 5 is the sum of term 3 and term 4, so 8 + 13 = 21.\n\nTerm 6 is term 4 plus term 5, that's 13 + 21 = 34.\n\nTerm 7 is term 5 plus term 6, so 21 + 34 = 55.\n\nFinally, term 8 is term 6 plus term 7, which is 34 + 55 = 89.\n\nSo, the 8th term in the sequence is 89.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any addition mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTerm 1: 3\n\nTerm 2: 5\n\nTerm 3: 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTerm 4: 5 + 8 = 13\n\nTerm 5: 8 + 13 = 21\n\nTerm 6: 13 + 21 = 34\n\nTerm 7: 21 + 34 = 55\n\nTerm 8: 34 + 55 = 89\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I know that in a Fibonacci sequence, each term is the sum of the two preceding ones. The standard Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, but here it starts with 3 and 5.\n\nI could also try to find a general formula for the nth term, but since the question only asks for the 8th term, listing them out step by step is straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nI think 89 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{89} \\]"
