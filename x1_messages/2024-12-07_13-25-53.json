        "content": "So, the car rental company has 150 cars in total, and 60% of them are rented out at any given time. You want to know how many cars are available for rent on average.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cars are rented out. If 60% of the cars are rented, we can calculate that by multiplying the total number of cars by 60%.\n\nSo, rented cars = 150 * 60% = 150 * 0.6 = 90 cars.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are available for rent, we subtract the number of rented cars from the total number of cars.\n\nAvailable cars = total cars - rented cars = 150 - 90 = 60 cars.\n\nTherefore, on average, there are 60 cars available for rent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
