        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a company with 10 employees, each working 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. That means each employee works 40 hours per week (since 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week). So, the total work hours per week for all employees is 10 employees * 40 hours/week = 400 hours/week.\n\nNow, the company wants to reduce work hours by 20% but maintain the same output. First, I need to understand what reducing work hours by 20% means. Is it a 20% reduction per employee, or is it a 20% reduction in total work hours?\n\nLet me consider the first interpretation: a 20% reduction per employee's work hours. So, if each employee currently works 40 hours/week, a 20% reduction would be 40 hours/week * 20% = 8 hours/week less. So, each employee would then work 32 hours/week.\n\nWith 10 employees working 32 hours/week, the total work hours would be 10 * 32 = 320 hours/week. But the company wants to maintain the same output as before, which was 400 hours/week. So, they need an additional 400 - 320 = 80 hours/week.\n\nNow, each new employee would also work 32 hours/week (since the reduced work hour policy applies to all employees). So, to cover the additional 80 hours/week, the company would need to hire 80 / 32 = 2.5 employees. Since you can't hire half an employee, they'd need to hire 3 additional employees.\n\nWait a minute, but is there another way to interpret the 20% reduction? Maybe it's a 20% reduction in total work hours, not per employee. Let's explore that.\n\nIf the total work hours are currently 400 hours/week, a 20% reduction would be 400 * 20% = 80 hours/week less. So, the total work hours would be 400 - 80 = 320 hours/week, same as before.\n\nTo maintain the same output of 400 hours/week with only 320 hours/week being worked, they need to find a way to make up for the 80 hours/week deficit. Hiring additional employees could be one way.\n\nAssuming each new employee also works 32 hours/week (under the reduced hour policy), the number of additional employees needed would be 80 / 32 = 2.5, which rounds up to 3 employees, same as before.\n\nBut maybe there's another approach. Perhaps the company could reduce the work hours per employee by 20% but keep the total output by increasing the number of employees accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s think in terms of total work hours needed. If the original total work hours are 400 hours/week, and they want to maintain that, but with reduced work hours per employee, they need to hire more employees to make up for the fewer hours each employee is working.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of additional employees needed as x.\n\nEach employee, after the reduction, works 32 hours/week.\n\nSo, the total work hours with the original 10 employees and x additional employees would be (10 + x) * 32 hours/week.\n\nThis needs to equal the original total work hours of 400 hours/week.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(10 + x) * 32 = 400\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n10 + x = 400 / 32\n\n10 + x = 12.5\n\nx = 12.5 - 10\n\nx = 2.5\n\nAgain, since you can't hire half an employee, they\u2019d need to hire 3 additional employees.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that employees can work part-time or that the company might hire fractional employees. But in reality, that\u2019s not usually how it works, so rounding up to 3 additional employees makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is in terms of work hours per employee. Originally, each employee works 40 hours/week. If work hours are reduced by 20%, that's a 5/4 reduction in work hours, since 1 - 0.20 = 0.80, and 1/0.80 = 1.25, which is a 25% increase in the number of employees needed to maintain the same output.\n\nSo, if originally there are 10 employees, to maintain the same output with each employee working 20% less hours, they would need 10 * 1.25 = 12.5 employees. Again, that's 2.5 additional employees, which rounds up to 3.\n\nThis confirms the previous calculations.\n\nBut perhaps there's another factor to consider. Maybe the company could adjust the work hours differently, like reducing the number of days worked per week or adjusting the number of hours per day differently.\n\nWait, the original setup is 8 hours/day for 5 days/week. If they reduce work hours by 20%, it could mean reducing the number of days worked per week by 20%, or reducing the hours per day by 20%, or some combination.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that.\n\nOption 1: Reduce hours per day by 20%.\n\nOriginally, 8 hours/day. A 20% reduction is 8 * 0.20 = 1.6 hours less, so 6.4 hours/day.\n\nThey still work 5 days/week, so total hours per week would be 6.4 hours/day * 5 days/week = 32 hours/week.\n\nWith 10 employees, total work hours would be 10 * 32 = 320 hours/week.\n\nTo maintain the original 400 hours/week, they need an additional 80 hours/week.\n\nEach new employee works 32 hours/week, so number of additional employees needed is 80 / 32 = 2.5, round up to 3.\n\nOption 2: Reduce the number of days worked per week by 20%.\n\nOriginally, 5 days/week. A 20% reduction is 5 * 0.20 = 1 day less, so 4 days/week.\n\nThey still work 8 hours/day, so total hours per week would be 8 hours/day * 4 days/week = 32 hours/week.\n\nWith 10 employees, total work hours would be 10 * 32 = 320 hours/week.\n\nAgain, to maintain 400 hours/week, they need an additional 80 hours/week.\n\nEach new employee works 32 hours/week, so again, 2.5 additional employees, round up to 3.\n\nOption 3: Some combination of reducing hours per day and days per week to achieve a 20% reduction in total work hours.\n\nBut ultimately, regardless of how they apportion the 20% reduction (whether by hours per day or days per week), the total hours per employee per week would still be 32 hours/week.\n\nThus, the calculation remains the same.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a more efficient way to allocate the reduced hours to minimize the number of additional employees needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company could have employees work different schedules to cover the necessary hours.\n\nBut in terms of straight-forward calculation, it seems that hiring 3 additional employees is the way to go.\n\nAnother consideration: perhaps the company could have employees work overtime to make up for the reduced hours.\n\nBut that might not be desirable, as it could lead to burnout or additional costs for overtime pay.\n\nMoreover, the problem states to maintain the same output with reduced work hours, implying that regular work hours are to be reduced, and possibly without relying on overtime.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company could increase productivity per hour to maintain output with fewer hours.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any increase in productivity; it only mentions reducing work hours while maintaining the same output.\n\nTherefore, hiring additional employees seems to be the straightforward solution.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more precise way to calculate the number of additional employees.\n\nWe have a total deficit of 80 hours/week, and each new employee can work 32 hours/week.\n\nSo, 80 / 32 = 2.5.\n\nNow, in reality, you can't hire half an employee, so you'd need to hire 3 employees.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to hire 2 additional employees and have them work overtime or have existing employees work a bit more.\n\nHowever, that contradicts the initial condition of reducing work hours by 20% for all employees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company could have some employees work more hours and some work fewer, but again, that might not align with the policy of reducing work hours by 20%.\n\nAssuming that all employees, including new ones, work the reduced hours of 32 hours/week, then 10 original employees plus 3 new employees would total 13 employees, working 13 * 32 = 416 hours/week, which is more than the required 400 hours/week.\n\nAlternatively, 10 + 2 = 12 employees would work 12 * 32 = 384 hours/week, which is less than 400 hours/week.\n\nTherefore, hiring 3 additional employees would provide 416 hours/week, which is sufficient to meet the 400 hours/week output.\n\nSo, the company needs to hire 3 additional employees.\n\nWait, but is there a way to make this more precise?\n\nLet\u2019s consider that 2 additional employees would provide 12 employees * 32 hours/week = 384 hours/week, which is 16 hours/week short of the required 400 hours/week.\n\nThen, perhaps the company could have some employees work a few extra hours to make up for the deficit.\n\nFor example, if each of the 12 employees works an extra 1.33 hours/week, that would make up the 16 hours/week deficit (since 12 * 1.33 \u2248 16).\n\nBut this would mean that not all employees are working the reduced 32 hours/week, which contradicts the initial condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some employees could work more hours while others work exactly 32 hours.\n\nBut again, this complicates the uniform reduction policy.\n\nTherefore, to strictly adhere to the policy of reducing work hours by 20% for all employees and maintaining the same output, hiring 3 additional employees seems necessary.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the company could adjust the work hours further for existing employees and new hires.\n\nBut that might not be feasible or fair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company could implement more efficient processes to increase output per hour, but again, the problem doesn't suggest that productivity is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward solution is to hire 3 additional employees, bringing the total number of employees to 13, who would then work 32 hours/week each, providing a total of 416 hours/week, which exceeds the required 400 hours/week.\n\nThis ensures that the output is maintained despite the reduction in work hours per employee.\n\nIn conclusion, the company needs to hire 3 additional employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
