        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 6 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nHmm, maybe I can start by thinking about smaller numbers and see if I can find a pattern. Let's say there are 2 people. Person A and Person B. They each shake hands with each other once, so that's 1 handshake.\n\nNow, if there are 3 people: Person A, B, and C. A shakes hands with B and C, and B shakes hands with C. So that's 3 handshakes in total.\n\nWait, is there a pattern here? With 2 people, 1 handshake; with 3 people, 3 handshakes. Maybe with 4 people, it would be 6 handshakes. Let me check.\n\nSo, with 4 people: A, B, C, D. A shakes hands with B, C, D (that's 3 handshakes); B shakes hands with C and D (that's 2 more handshakes); C shakes hands with D (1 more handshake). Total: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 handshakes.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, for each new person, they shake hands with everyone who is already there.\n\nSo, for 5 people: with 4 people, there are 6 handshakes, and the 5th person shakes hands with the 4 existing people, adding 4 more handshakes. So, 6 + 4 = 10 handshakes.\n\nSimilarly, for 6 people: starting with 5 people having 10 handshakes, and the 6th person shakes hands with the 5 existing people, adding 5 more handshakes. So, 10 + 5 = 15 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, is there a formula for this? It seems like the number of handshakes is the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n to shake hands. That sounds like a combination problem.\n\nYes, the number of handshakes should be equal to the number of combinations of n people taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 6 and k = 2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = (720) / (2 * 24) = 720 / 48 = 15.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier by adding up the handshakes step by step.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is 15.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me see if this formula works for smaller numbers.\n\nWith n = 2: C(2, 2) = 1, which matches the 1 handshake.\n\nWith n = 3: C(3, 2) = 3, which matches the 3 handshakes.\n\nWith n = 4: C(4, 2) = 6, which matches the 6 handshakes.\n\nWith n = 5: C(5, 2) = 10, which matches the 10 handshakes.\n\nAnd with n = 6: C(6, 2) = 15.\n\nPerfect, the formula works.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of the formula n(n-1)/2 for the number of handshakes, where n is the number of people. Let's see: for n = 6, it would be 6*5/2 = 30/2 = 15, which again matches.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 15 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
