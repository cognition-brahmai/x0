        "content": "So I have this problem about a water tank. The tank can hold up to 500 liters, and right now it has 300 liters in it. I need to fill it up to the top by adding water at a rate of 20 liters per minute. The question is, how long will it take to fill the tank completely?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much more water is needed to fill the tank. The total capacity is 500 liters, and there's already 300 liters in it. So, the amount of water needed is 500 minus 300, which is 200 liters.\n\nNow, I'm adding water at a rate of 20 liters per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take to add 200 liters, I can divide the amount of water needed by the rate at which I'm adding it. So, 200 liters divided by 20 liters per minute.\n\nLet me do the calculation: 200 divided by 20 is 10. So, it should take 10 minutes to fill the tank.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? The tank is currently at 300 liters, and I need to reach 500 liters. Yes, that's a difference of 200 liters. Adding 20 liters each minute, so 200 divided by 20 is indeed 10 minutes.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any limitation on the filling rate or if the tank has any restrictions, but based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer is 10 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
