        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about marbles in a bag. There are red, blue, green, and yellow marbles. If I pick one at random, the probability of getting a red marble is 1/4, a blue one is 1/3, and a green one is 1/6. I need to find out the probability of picking a yellow marble.\n\nFirst, I know that the sum of all probabilities of all possible outcomes should equal 1, right? Because something has to happen, and one of the marbles has to be picked. So, if I add up the probabilities of picking red, blue, green, and yellow, it should equal 1.\n\nSo, probability of red is 1/4, blue is 1/3, green is 1/6, and yellow is what we're looking for. Let's denote the probability of yellow as P(yellow).\n\nSo, P(red) + P(blue) + P(green) + P(yellow) = 1.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n1/4 + 1/3 + 1/6 + P(yellow) = 1.\n\nNow, I need to add those fractions together. To do that, I need a common denominator. Let's see, the denominators are 4, 3, and 6. The least common multiple of 4, 3, and 6 is 12.\n\nSo, converting each fraction to have a denominator of 12:\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\n1/3 = 4/12\n\n1/6 = 2/12\n\nSo, 3/12 + 4/12 + 2/12 + P(yellow) = 1.\n\nAdding those up: 3 + 4 + 2 = 9, so 9/12.\n\nTherefore, 9/12 + P(yellow) = 1.\n\nTo find P(yellow), subtract 9/12 from 1.\n\n1 is the same as 12/12, so 12/12 - 9/12 = 3/12.\n\nSimplifying 3/12, it's 1/4.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a yellow marble is 1/4.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the fractions.\n\nLet's add 1/4, 1/3, and 1/6 again.\n\n1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, and 1/6 is 2/12. Yes, 3 + 4 + 2 = 9/12.\n\nThen, 12/12 - 9/12 = 3/12, which is 1/4.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using the concept of proportions or something else.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it differently. Suppose there are a total of m marbles in the bag.\n\nThen, the number of red marbles is (1/4)m,\n\nBlue marbles is (1/3)m,\n\nGreen marbles is (1/6)m,\n\nAnd yellow marbles is y.\n\nSince total marbles are m, then:\n\n(1/4)m + (1/3)m + (1/6)m + y = m.\n\nWe can factor out m:\n\nm*(1/4 + 1/3 + 1/6) + y = m.\n\nThen, y = m - m*(1/4 + 1/3 + 1/6).\n\nFactor m:\n\ny = m*(1 - (1/4 + 1/3 + 1/6)).\n\nWait, that\u2019s similar to what I did earlier.\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses:\n\n1/4 + 1/3 + 1/6.\n\nUsing a common denominator of 12:\n\n1/4 = 3/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/6 = 2/12.\n\nSo, 3/12 + 4/12 + 2/12 = 9/12.\n\nThen, 1 - 9/12 = 3/12 = 1/4.\n\nSo, y = m*(1/4).\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a yellow marble is y/m = (1/4)m / m = 1/4.\n\nOkay, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of actual numbers. Suppose there are 12 marbles in the bag, since 12 is a common multiple of 4, 3, and 6.\n\nThen:\n\nRed marbles: 1/4 * 12 = 3\n\nBlue marbles: 1/3 * 12 = 4\n\nGreen marbles: 1/6 * 12 = 2\n\nTotal of these is 3 + 4 + 2 = 9 marbles.\n\nSince there are 12 marbles in total, the number of yellow marbles is 12 - 9 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a yellow marble is 3/12 = 1/4.\n\nAgain, this matches my previous result.\n\nLet me try one more way to be sure. Suppose I use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = number of favorable outcomes / total number of outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are picking a yellow marble, and the total outcomes are picking any marble.\n\nWe don't know the total number of marbles, but we can express the probabilities in terms of the total number, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since the probabilities must sum to 1, and I have the probabilities for red, blue, and green, I can subtract their sum from 1 to get the probability of yellow.\n\nWhich is what I did initially.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the probability of picking a yellow marble is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
