Car A gets 20 miles per gallon, Car B gets 30 miles per gallon, and Car C gets 40 miles per gallon. If they all drive the same distance and use a total of 60 gallons of gas, how many gallons did each car use?"

        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are three cars: A, B, and C, each with different fuel efficiencies. Car A gets 20 miles per gallon, Car B gets 30 miles per gallon, and Car C gets 40 miles per gallon. They all drive the same distance, and together they use a total of 60 gallons of gas. I need to find out how many gallons each car used.\n\nFirst, since all cars drove the same distance, let's call that distance \"d\" miles. Now, I know that fuel efficiency is miles per gallon, so I can express the gallons each car used in terms of d.\n\nFor Car A, which gets 20 miles per gallon, the gallons used would be d divided by 20. So, gallons used by Car A is d/20.\n\nSimilarly, for Car B, which gets 30 miles per gallon, gallons used would be d/30.\n\nAnd for Car C, which gets 40 miles per gallon, gallons used would be d/40.\n\nNow, the total gallons used by all three cars is 60 gallons. So, I can set up an equation:\n\nd/20 + d/30 + d/40 = 60\n\nI need to solve for d.\n\nFirst, I'll find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 20, 30, and 40. The least common multiple of these numbers is 120.\n\nSo, I'll rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 120.\n\nd/20 = (d * 6)/120 = 6d/120\n\nd/30 = (d * 4)/120 = 4d/120\n\nd/40 = (d * 3)/120 = 3d/120\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n6d/120 + 4d/120 + 3d/120 = 13d/120\n\nSet this equal to 60:\n\n13d/120 = 60\n\nNow, solve for d:\n\nMultiply both sides by 120:\n\n13d = 60 * 120\n\n13d = 7200\n\nNow, divide both sides by 13:\n\nd = 7200 / 13\n\nd = 553.846153846 miles (approximately)\n\nSo, the distance each car drove is approximately 553.85 miles.\n\nNow, I can find out how many gallons each car used.\n\nFor Car A:\n\nGallons = d / 20 = 553.85 / 20 = 27.6923 gallons (approximately)\n\nFor Car B:\n\nGallons = d / 30 = 553.85 / 30 = 18.4615 gallons (approximately)\n\nFor Car C:\n\nGallons = d / 40 = 553.85 / 40 = 13.8462 gallons (approximately)\n\nLet me check if these add up to 60 gallons:\n\n27.6923 + 18.4615 + 13.8462 = 60 gallons\n\nYes, it adds up.\n\nSo, Car A used approximately 27.69 gallons, Car B used approximately 18.46 gallons, and Car C used approximately 13.85 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Car A: approximately } 27.69 \\text{ gallons, Car B: approximately } 18.46 \\text{ gallons, Car C: approximately } 13.85 \\text{ gallons}} \\]"
