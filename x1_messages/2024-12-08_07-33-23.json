        "content": "So I need to find the area under the curve y equals x squared from x equals 0 to x equals 3 using integration. Okay, I remember that integration can be used to find areas under curves. So, the definite integral from 0 to 3 of x squared dx should give me that area.\n\nFirst, I need to set up the integral: \u222b from 0 to 3 of x^2 dx.\n\nI know that the antiderivative of x^2 is (x^3)/3. So, I'll use that to evaluate the definite integral.\n\nSo, the area A is equal to [(3)^3 / 3] minus [(0)^3 / 3].\n\nLet me calculate that: (27 / 3) - (0 / 3) = 9 - 0 = 9.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems too straightforward. Maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the area under a curve using definite integrals. The general formula is A = \u222b from a to b of f(x) dx, where f(x) is the function and a and b are the limits.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = x^2, a = 0, and b = 3.\n\nSo, A = \u222b from 0 to 3 of x^2 dx.\n\nLet me find the antiderivative again: \u222b x^2 dx = (x^3)/3 + C.\n\nNow, evaluate from 0 to 3: [(3^3)/3] - [(0^3)/3] = (27/3) - (0/3) = 9 - 0 = 9.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can verify this using another method, like numerical integration.\n\nLet's try using Riemann sums. If I divide the interval from 0 to 3 into n subintervals, each of width delta x = (3 - 0)/n = 3/n.\n\nThen, the right Riemann sum would be the sum from i=1 to n of f(x_i) * delta x, where x_i = 0 + i*(3/n) = 3i/n.\n\nSo, f(x_i) = (3i/n)^2 = 9i^2/n^2.\n\nTherefore, the Riemann sum is sum from i=1 to n of (9i^2/n^2) * (3/n) = sum from i=1 to n of (27i^2)/(n^3).\n\nI know that sum from i=1 to n of i^2 is [n(n+1)(2n+1)]/6.\n\nSo, plugging that in: (27/[n^3]) * [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] = (27/6) * [n(n+1)(2n+1)/n^3] = (9/2) * [(n(n+1)(2n+1))/n^3].\n\nSimplify the expression inside: (n(n+1)(2n+1))/n^3 = (n/n) * ((n+1)/n) * ((2n+1)/n) = 1 * (1 + 1/n) * (2 + 1/n).\n\nSo, the Riemann sum is (9/2) * [1 * (1 + 1/n) * (2 + 1/n)].\n\nNow, take the limit as n approaches infinity: lim n->\u221e (9/2) * (1 + 1/n)(2 + 1/n) = (9/2) * (1)(2) = (9/2)*2 = 9.\n\nOkay, so even using Riemann sums, I get the same answer, which is 9.\n\nLet me try another approach, maybe using the fundamental theorem of calculus.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus says that the definite integral from a to b of f(x) dx is F(b) - F(a), where F is an antiderivative of f.\n\nSo, for f(x) = x^2, F(x) = (x^3)/3.\n\nTherefore, A = F(3) - F(0) = (27/3) - (0/3) = 9 - 0 = 9.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nWait, maybe I can use trigonometric substitution or another integration technique, but that seems unnecessary for this simple polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, I could use integration by parts, but that might be overkill.\n\nLet's try it anyway for practice.\n\nLet\u2019s set u = x and dv = x dx.\n\nThen, du = dx and v = x^2/2.\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula: \u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du.\n\nSo, \u222b x * x dx = (x)(x^2/2) - \u222b (x^2/2) dx = (x^3)/2 - (1/2)\u222b x^2 dx.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful because I end up with the same integral I started with.\n\nLet me rearrange: \u222b x^2 dx = (x^3)/2 - (1/2)\u222b x^2 dx.\n\nThen, adding (1/2)\u222b x^2 dx to both sides: (3/2)\u222b x^2 dx = (x^3)/2.\n\nTherefore, \u222b x^2 dx = (x^3)/3, which is what I had before.\n\nSo, again, it confirms the original answer.\n\nMaybe I can use substitution. Let\u2019s set t = x^3/3.\n\nThen, dt/dx = x^2, so dt = x^2 dx.\n\nWhen x = 0, t = 0.\n\nWhen x = 3, t = 9.\n\nTherefore, \u222b from 0 to 3 of x^2 dx = \u222b from 0 to 9 of dt = t | from 0 to 9 = 9 - 0 = 9.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems no matter which method I use, I get the area as 9.\n\nPerhaps I can graph it to visualize. From x = 0 to x = 3, y = x^2 starts at (0,0) and ends at (3,9).\n\nThe area under the curve should be a region bounded by the curve, the x-axis, and the lines x = 0 and x = 3.\n\nI know that the integral gives the signed area, and since y = x^2 is always positive in this interval, the area is simply positive.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the area of a parabolic segment.\n\nFor a parabola y = ax^2, the area from x = 0 to x = b is (a*b^3)/3.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 3, so area = (1*27)/3 = 9, which matches my previous calculations.\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring that multiple methods lead to the same result.\n\nI think I\u2019ve confirmed sufficiently that the area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 3 is 9 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
