        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to figure out how many ways there are to distribute 10 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes. Hmm, okay, let's see. Since the balls are identical, it's not about arranging them, but rather about how many balls go into each box.\n\nFirst, I should think about whether the boxes are distinct or identical. Wait, the problem says the boxes are distinct, so that means that which box is which matters. So, putting 5 balls in box 1 and 5 in box 2 is different from putting 5 in box 2 and 5 in box 1, because the boxes are distinguishable.\n\nAlso, the balls are identical, so it's not like each ball is unique; they're all the same. That simplifies things because I don't have to worry about arranging different items.\n\nNow, I recall there's a formula for distributing identical items into distinct bins. It's something like combinations with repetition, or maybe it's stars and bars method. Let me try to remember that.\n\nStars and bars method: It's used to find the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k distinct boxes. The formula is C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where C is the combination function.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. So, n is the number of balls, which is 10, and k is the number of boxes, which is 4.\n\nPlugging into the formula: C(10 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(13, 3).\n\nNow, I need to calculate C(13, 3). That's the number of combinations of 13 things taken 3 at a time.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nSo, C(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * 10!)\".\n\nLet me compute that. First, 13! is 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!, and since 10! is in both the numerator and the denominator, they cancel out.\n\nSo, it simplifies to 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 / 3! .\n\nNow, 3! is 6.\n\nSo, 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 / 6.\n\nLet's calculate numerator first: 13 \u00d7 12 = 156, then 156 \u00d7 11 = 1716.\n\nThen, divide by 6: 1716 / 6 = 286.\n\nSo, there are 286 ways to distribute 10 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there are any restrictions, like whether boxes can be empty or not. The problem doesn't specify, so I think boxes can be empty.\n\nYes, in the stars and bars method, it's assumed that boxes can be empty. If boxes couldn't be empty, meaning each box must have at least one ball, then the formula would be different.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I'll go with the assumption that boxes can be empty.\n\nIs there another way to think about this to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can think of it as solving the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 10, where xi >= 0, and xi are integers.\n\nYes, that's exactly what stars and bars is for: finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation.\n\nAnd the formula is indeed C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is 10 and k is 4.\n\nSo, yep, 286 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could list out some possible distributions to see if the formula makes sense.\n\nFor example:\n\n- All 10 balls in one box: There are 4 ways to do this, one for each box.\n\n- 9 balls in one box and 1 in another: Choose 2 boxes, one gets 9 and the other gets 1. There are 4 choices for the box with 9, and 3 remaining choices for the box with 1, so 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ways.\n\nWait, but actually, since the balls are identical, and the boxes are distinct, putting 9 in box 1 and 1 in box 2 is different from putting 9 in box 2 and 1 in box 1.\n\nSo, that's correct: 12 ways.\n\n- 8 balls in one box and 2 in another: Similarly, 4 choices for the box with 8, and 3 for the box with 2, so 12 ways.\n\n- 8 in one box, 1 in another, and 1 in another: 4 choices for the box with 8, and then C(3,2) = 3 ways to choose the two boxes that get 1 each, so 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ways.\n\n- 7 in one box and 3 in another: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ways.\n\n- 7 in one box, 2 in another, and 1 in another: 4 choices for the box with 7, then C(3,2) ways to choose the boxes for 2 and 1, which is 3, but then you have to specify which of the two gets 2 and which gets 1, so it's 3 \u00d7 2 = 6, but wait, no, C(3,2) already chooses the two boxes, and then you assign 2 and 1 to them, so it's 3 \u00d7 2 = 6, so total 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 ways.\n\n- 6 in one box and 4 in another: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ways.\n\n- 6 in one box, 3 in another, and 1 in another: 4 \u00d7 C(3,2) \u00d7 2 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 24 ways.\n\n- 6 in one box, 2 in each of the other two: 4 \u00d7 C(3,2) = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ways.\n\n- 5 in one box and 5 in another: C(4,2) = 6 ways.\n\n- 5 in one box, 4 in another, and 1 in another: 4 \u00d7 C(3,2) \u00d7 2 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 24 ways.\n\n- 5 in one box, 3 in another, and 2 in another: 4 \u00d7 C(3,2) \u00d7 2 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 24 ways.\n\n- 4 in one box, 3 in another, and 3 in another: 4 \u00d7 C(3,2) = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ways.\n\n- 4 in one box, 4 in another, and 2 in another: C(4,2) \u00d7 2 = 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 ways.\n\n- 4 in one box, 3 in another, and 3 in another: Wait, already counted that.\n\n- 3 in each of three boxes: C(4,3) = 4 ways.\n\n- 2 in each of five boxes: Not possible, only 4 boxes.\n\n- Etc.\n\nThis is getting tedious, and I might be missing some combinations, but the total should add up to 286 if I list them all correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use generating functions for this problem.\n\nThe generating function for each box is 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^10, since each box can have from 0 to 10 balls.\n\nSince there are 4 boxes, the generating function is (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^10)^4.\n\nBut since the balls are identical and there's no upper limit specified for the boxes, I can consider it as (1 + x + x^2 + ...)^4.\n\nThis is a geometric series, and 1 + x + x^2 + ... = 1 / (1 - x), so (1 / (1 - x))^4 = (1 - x)^(-4).\n\nNow, the coefficient of x^10 in (1 - x)^(-4) is C(10 + 4 - 1, 10), which is C(13, 10).\n\nBut C(13, 10) is the same as C(13, 3), since C(n, k) = C(n, n - k).\n\nSo again, C(13, 3) = 286.\n\nAlright, this matches the stars and bars method.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 286 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{286} \\]"
