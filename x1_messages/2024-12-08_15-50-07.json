        "content": "So I've got this problem here about chocolates. There are different types: milk, dark, and white. Let's see how many of each there are. It says there are 5 milk chocolates, 7 dark chocolates, and 8 white chocolates. So, if I want to find the probability of picking a milk chocolate or a dark chocolate randomly from the box, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of chocolates in the box. That should be the sum of all the different types, right? So, total chocolates = milk + dark + white = 5 + 7 + 8. Let's add those up: 5 plus 7 is 12, and then plus 8 is 20. So, there are 20 chocolates in total.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a milk chocolate or a dark chocolate. So, the number of favorable outcomes should be the number of milk chocolates plus the number of dark chocolates, which is 5 + 7 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a milk or dark chocolate is 12 (favorable outcomes) divided by 20 (total outcomes). So, that's 12/20.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. Both 12 and 20 can be divided by 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3, and 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, the simplified fraction is 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal or a percentage. As a decimal, 3 divided by 5 is 0.6, and as a percentage, that's 60%. So, there's a 60% chance of picking a milk or dark chocolate.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, could I find the probability of picking milk chocolate and the probability of picking dark chocolate separately, and then add them together?\n\nLet's try that. Probability of picking milk chocolate is 5/20, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25. Probability of picking dark chocolate is 7/20, which is 0.35. If I add those together, 0.25 + 0.35 = 0.6, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like I did it correctly.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider the probability of not picking a white chocolate, since picking milk or dark is the same as not picking white.\n\nThe number of white chocolates is 8, so the probability of picking a white chocolate is 8/20, which is 0.4 or 40%. Therefore, the probability of not picking a white chocolate is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, or 60%, which again matches my previous calculations.\n\nOkay, so all methods lead to the same conclusion. The probability is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there any chance that the chocolates are not equally likely to be picked? For example, maybe some are bigger and take up more space, but the problem says \"randomly pick one without looking,\" so I think it's safe to assume each chocolate has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"milk chocolate or dark chocolate,\" so I'm including both in my favorable outcomes. There's no overlap between milk and dark chocolates, so no need to worry about that.\n\nAlright, I've convinced myself that 3/5 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
