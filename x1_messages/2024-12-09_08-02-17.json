CRESTWOOD - DAY\n\nA unique town where horse-drawn carriages clop along cobblestone streets, sharing space with futuristic hover vehicles that glide silently above. Bioluminescent plants line the streets, casting an ethereal glow, their soft hum filling the air.\n\nINT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - DAY\n\nPROFESSOR JULIAN KEATS (50s, bespectacled, with a wild shock of gray hair) is poring over ancient texts, his fingers tracing illustrations of long-forgotten transportation devices. He's a university professor, renowned for his expertise in historical transportation systems, but his personal life is a different story.\n\nHis daughter, EVELYN (20s, independent, with a hint of resentment), bursts in, holding a stack of papers.\n\nEVELYN\nDad, you missed another dinner. Mom's birthday is next week, and you promised\u2014\n\nJULIAN\n(sighing)\nEvelyn, I'm sorry. This research\u2014\n\nEVELYN\n(interrupting)\nDad, your research is consuming you. Mom's not getting any younger.\n\nJULIAN\n(nodding, lost in thought)\nI know, I know.\n\nEvelyn leaves, shaking her head.\n\nJULIAN (CONT'D)\n(muttering)\nI need to find this device.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PROFESSOR KEATS' OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nJulian is surrounded by books and half-empty coffee cups. He holds up a worn blueprint, studying it intently.\n\nJULIAN\n(to himself)\nThis can't be real.\n\nSuddenly, his time-travel episodes are linked to this forgotten invention.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CRESTWOOD TOWN SQUARE - DAY\n\nMayor REBECCA TURNER (40s, charismatic, with a no-nonsense attitude) addresses the crowd from a podium. Behind her, a horse-drawn carriage passes by, while a hover vehicle zooms overhead.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n...and today, we celebrate the harmony of our past and future, united in Crestwood!\n\nThe crowd cheers. Turner smiles, but her eyes linger on Julian, who's observing from the sidelines.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nTurner sits behind her desk, reviewing documents. Julian enters, holding the blueprint.\n\nJULIAN\nMayor Turner, may I have a moment?\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nOf course, Professor. What brings you here?\n\nJULIAN\nI've discovered something extraordinary. A blueprint for a device that could manipulate time.\n\nTurner raises an eyebrow, skepticism evident.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nTime travel? That's... theoretical, at best.\n\nJULIAN\nI know, but the correlations are undeniable. My time-travel episodes coincide with this invention.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAnd you think this blueprint holds the key?\n\nJULIAN\nYes, but I need your help to decipher it.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(sighing)\nProfessor, I respect your work, but this seems far-fetched.\n\nJULIAN\n(reaching out)\nRebecca, please. This could change everything.\n\nTurner looks into his eyes, seeing his determination and perhaps a hint of desperation.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAlright, but I have conditions.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. OLD LIBRARY - DAY\n\nJulian and Turner pore over old texts, trying to make sense of the blueprint. ZEPHYR (a steampunk automaton with gears and brass fittings, its eyes glowing) hovers nearby, observing.\n\nZEPHYR\n(synthetic voice)\nInteresting findings, Professor Keats.\n\nJULIAN\n(startled)\nZephyr! What are you doing here?\n\nZEPHYR\nI've been monitoring your research. The blueprint... it's reminiscent of ancient time-travel mechanisms.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(skeptical)\nTime-travel mechanisms? You mean like in science fiction?\n\nZEPHYR\nIn various cultures, such devices have been theorized. The key lies in understanding the convergence of past and future technologies.\n\nJULIAN\n(nodding)\nThat's what I've been thinking. Crestwood's unique blend of old and new might be the catalyst.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut at what cost? Our transport guilds work hard to maintain balance.\n\nZEPHYR\nIndeed, balance is crucial. Disrupting the timeline could have unforeseen consequences.\n\nJULIAN\n(resolute)\nI must try. For the sake of knowledge and, perhaps, for my own sake.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. TRANSPORT GUILD HALL - DAY\n\nGuild members, dressed in traditional attire, discuss the recent discovery.\n\nGUILD MASTER\n(this character is introduced here, a seasoned man with a stern expression)\nThis time-travel business is nonsense. We must focus on maintaining order.\n\nANOTHER GUILD MEMBER\nBut Professor Keats is a respected scholar. Maybe there's something to it.\n\nGUILD MASTER\n(scoffing)\nTime travel? More like time waste.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. OLD LIBRARY - DAY\n\nJulian, Turner, and Zephyr continue their research.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nSo, what's the plan?\n\nJULIAN\nWe need to understand the blueprint fully. It seems to require specific components, some of which are obsolete.\n\nZEPHYR\nI can assist in procuring the necessary parts. My temporal abilities can retrieve items from different eras.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nTemporal abilities? You mean time travel?\n\nZEPHYR\nAffirmative. Though, I operate within strict protocols to avoid disrupting the timeline.\n\nJULIAN\nThen, with Zephyr's help, we might be able to build this device.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut what about the risks? Altering time could have catastrophic effects.\n\nJULIAN\nI'm aware, but I can't ignore this opportunity. Not anymore.\n\nZEPHYR\nPerhaps, the blueprint is a key to understanding the fabric of time itself.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(sighing)\nAlright, but I need to keep this under wraps. The guilds can't know about this.\n\nJULIAN\nAgreed.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PROFESSOR KEATS' LAB - NIGHT\n\nJulian works late, assembling parts with Zephyr's assistance. Turner watches from the doorway.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nYou sure about this, Julian?\n\nJULIAN\nYes, Rebecca. This could solve my problem, bring closure.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAnd what if it doesn't?\n\nJULIAN\nThen, at least I tried.\n\nTurner approaches, placing a hand on his shoulder.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBe careful, Julian. I don't want to lose you.\n\nJULIAN\nYou won't.\n\nZephyr hovers nearby, observing silently.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - LATER\n\nThe device is almost complete. Julian inspects each component meticulously.\n\nZEPHYR\nThe final piece is the quantum entangler. It's crucial for stabilizing the time vortex.\n\nJULIAN\nWhere can we find one?\n\nZEPHYR\nI can retrieve it from the future archives.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWait, future archives? That sounds risky.\n\nZEPHYR\nMinimal risk, Mayor Turner. I've performed similar tasks before.\n\nJULIAN\nThen let's proceed.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FUTURE ARCHIVES - ZEPHYR'S PERSPECTIVE\n\nZephyr navigates through a futuristic library, shelves filled with holographic books and ancient artifacts. It locates the quantum entangler, a small, pulsating device.\n\nZEPHYR\n(acquiring the device)\nQuantum entangler secured.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. LAB - NIGHT\n\nZephyr places the quantum entangler in the device.\n\nJULIAN\nPerfect. Now, let's see if this works.\n\nHe activates the device. A swirling vortex appears in the center, emitting a soft hum.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(in awe)\nIs that... time?\n\nJULIAN\nIt seems so. Now, to test its stability.\n\nZephyr approaches the vortex, extending a mechanical arm.\n\nZEPHYR\nI'll attempt to send a temporal probe.\n\nThe probe enters the vortex and disappears.\n\nJULIAN\nMonitor its progress.\n\nZEPHYR\nAffirmative.\n\nSuddenly, the device starts to fluctuate, the vortex destabilizing.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWhat's happening?\n\nJULIAN\nIt's drawing more energy than anticipated. We need to shut it down.\n\nZEPHYR\nWait! The probe has sent back data. It's traversed time successfully.\n\nJULIAN\nBut at what cost? The device is overloaded.\n\nHe frantically tries to shut it down, but it's too late. The vortex explodes, engulfing the lab in a blinding light.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - MOMENTS LATER\n\nSmoke fills the room. Julian, Turner, and Zephyr are disoriented but unharmed.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAre you both alright?\n\nJULIAN\n(nodding)\nYes, but the device is destroyed.\n\nZEPHYR\nAnd the temporal probe is lost in time.\n\nJULIAN\nNo, Zephyr, you must retrieve it. It could cause unpredictable temporal anomalies.\n\nZEPHYR\nAcknowledged. I will attempt to locate and retrieve the probe.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBe careful, Zephyr. We don't know what kind of trouble you might stir up.\n\nZEPHYR\nI understand, Mayor Turner. Time is a delicate fabric; I shall proceed with caution.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - LATER\n\nJulian and Turner clean up the mess, their faces etched with worry.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThis was a disaster, Julian. We nearly caused a temporal catastrophe.\n\nJULIAN\nI know, but think of the potential. We came so close.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAt what cost? Your obsession is dangerous.\n\nJULIAN\n(sighing)\nI can't give up now, Rebecca. Not when I'm this close.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThen, at least let's proceed more cautiously. We need to understand the risks better.\n\nJULIAN\nAgreed.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. OLD LIBRARY - DAY\n\nJulian and Turner continue their research, now with a newfound sense of caution.\n\nZEPHYR\n(holographically projected)\nI've located the temporal probe in the year 1892. It seems to be integrated into an old steam engine.\n\nJULIAN\n1892? That's during the industrial revolution. Maybe that's where the original blueprint came from.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut why would a time-travel device exist in the past?\n\nZEPHYR\nPerhaps it's a remnant of a previous temporal incursion.\n\nJULIAN\nWhatever the case, we need to retrieve it before it causes any disruptions.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAnd how do you propose we do that?\n\nZEPHYR\nI can travel back and retrieve the probe, ensuring it doesn't interfere with the timeline.\n\nJULIAN\nBut won't that create a paradox?\n\nZEPHYR\nI've been programmed to avoid such scenarios. I'll proceed with the retrieval.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWait, Zephyr. Be careful. We don't want to alter history.\n\nZEPHYR\nUnderstood, Mayor Turner. I'll proceed with the utmost discretion.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - NIGHT\n\nZephyr prepares to embark on its mission.\n\nJULIAN\nGood luck, Zephyr. Be careful.\n\nZEPHYR\nThank you, Professor Keats. I'll return as soon as possible.\n\nIt activates its temporal drive, disappearing in a flash of light.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nTurner sits at her desk, staring at a photo of her family. She looks weary.\n\nPHONE RINGS\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(answering)\nMayor Turner here.\n\nIt's a concerned citizen calling about recent anomalies in the transport system.\n\nCITIZEN (V.O.)\nThere have been reports of vehicles disappearing and reappearing elsewhere. It's causing chaos.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(sighing)\nI'll look into it. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.\n\nShe hangs up, looking worried.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. TRANSPORTATION CONTROL ROOM - DAY\n\nTechnicians monitor screens displaying transport routes and vehicle locations. Alarms blare as anomalies are detected.\n\nTECHNICIAN 1\nWe're experiencing temporal fluctuations in the transport network.\n\nTECHNICIAN 2\nIt's causing vehicles to jump between times.\n\nANOTHER TECHNICIAN\nThis is beyond our capabilities. We need to inform the mayor.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nTurner receives the report, her expression grave.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThis can't be a coincidence. It must be related to Julian's experiment.\n\nShe picks up the phone, dialing Julian's number.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PROFESSOR KEATS' OFFICE - DAY\n\nJulian is deep in thought when Turner's call comes in.\n\nJULIAN\n(answer)\nYes, Rebecca?\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nJulian, there are temporal anomalies in the transport system. Vehicles are disappearing and reappearing at different times.\n\nJULIAN\n(stunned)\nThat can't be good. It must be the probe.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWe need to find a way to stop it.\n\nJULIAN\nAnd fast. Those anomalies could destabilize the entire transport network.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nI'm on my way to your lab. Let's see what we can do.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - DAY\n\nJulian and Turner brainstorm solutions.\n\nJULIAN\nIf the probe is integrated into a steam engine in 1892, we need to retrieve it before it causes more damage.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut how? Zephyr is already there.\n\nJULIAN\nPerhaps we can build another device to send someone back.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAnother time machine? Julian, that's too risky.\n\nJULIAN\nI know, but it might be our only option.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. OLD LIBRARY - DAY\n\nThey search for more information on time travel and the original blueprint.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nSo, this blueprint was created in 1892 by an inventor named Eliasz?\n\nJULIAN\nYes, but his work was lost to history. Maybe the probe contains data that can help us.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nIf Zephyr can retrieve it, we might be able to reverse the anomalies.\n\nJULIAN\nExactly.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ZEPHYR'S TEMPORAL CHAMBER - 1892\n\nZephyr materializes in a steam-filled workshop. An old steam engine catches its attention.\n\nZEPHYR\n(synthetic voice)\nTarget located.\n\nIt approaches the engine, examining it closely.\n\nZEPHYR (CONT'D)\nThe probe seems to be fused with the engine's components.\n\nIt begins to disassemble parts, careful not to disturb the surroundings.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - PRESENT DAY\n\nJulian and Turner work frantically to build a makeshift time machine.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAre you sure this will work?\n\nJULIAN\nIt's based on the original blueprint, with some modifications. It should be stable enough for short trips.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAnd who's going to operate it?\n\nJULIAN\nI will.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nNo, Julian. It's too dangerous.\n\nJULIAN\nI have to do this. It's my responsibility.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(sighing)\nAlright, but I'm coming with you.\n\nJULIAN\n(rejecting)\nNo, Rebecca. It's too risky. You need to stay here and manage the situation.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut\u2014\n\nJULIAN\nNo buts. This is my mission.\n\nHe activates the device, stepping into the time vortex.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CRESTWOOD - DAY\n\nThe town continues its daily routine, unaware of the temporal disturbances brewing beneath the surface.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. 1892 WORKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER\n\nZephyr has successfully removed the probe from the steam engine. Suddenly, Julian materializes in the workshop.\n\nJULIAN\n(catching his breath)\nZephyr, I need that probe.\n\nZEPHYR\nProfessor Keats, what are you doing here?\n\nJULIAN\nI had to retrieve it myself. The transport system is in chaos.\n\nZEPHYR\nI've already removed the probe. Here.\n\nZEPHYR hands the probe to Julian.\n\nJULIAN\nGood. Now, let's get back before we cause more disruptions.\n\nThey prepare to return to their time.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - PRESENT DAY\n\nTurner waits anxiously, monitoring the situation.\n\nTECHNICIAN\n(reporting)\nThe anomalies are spreading. We're losing control of the transport network.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nHold on, help is on the way.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. 1892 WORKSHOP - DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr activate their temporal drives, disappearing in a flash.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - PRESENT DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr reappear, holding the probe.\n\nJULIAN\nWe did it.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nNow, what do we do with it?\n\nJULIAN\nWe need to neutralize it, prevent it from causing any more trouble.\n\nZEPHYR\nI can dismantle it, ensuring it's no longer functional.\n\nJULIAN\nYes, do that.\n\nZephyr proceeds to disassemble the probe.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. TRANSPORTATION CONTROL ROOM - DAY\n\nThe temporal anomalies begin to subside as the probe is neutralized.\n\nTECHNICIAN\n(reporting)\nThe fluctuations are decreasing. The system is stabilizing.\n\nANOTHER TECHNICIAN\nThank goodness. We thought we were going to lose everything.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. LAB - DAY\n\nJulian and Turner breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThat was too close.\n\nJULIAN\nYes, but it's not over yet. There's still the matter of the original blueprint and Eliasz's invention.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nYou think there's more to discover?\n\nJULIAN\nAbsolutely. This is just the beginning.\n\nZEPHYR\nPerhaps, exploring Eliasz's work could provide insights into controlling time without causing disruptions.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut we need to proceed with extreme caution. We can't afford to mess with the timeline again.\n\nJULIAN\nAgreed. This time, let's be prepared.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. OLD LIBRARY - DAY\n\nJulian and Turner delve deeper into Eliasz's notes, discovering more about his time-travel theories.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nSo, Eliasz believed that by combining steam power with quantum entanglement, one could manipulate time.\n\nJULIAN\nYes, it's fascinating. His ideas were ahead of his time.\n\nZEPHYR\n(holographically projected)\nI've cross-referenced his theories with current quantum physics. There's potential validity to his approach.\n\nJULIAN\nThen, perhaps, with proper understanding and safeguards, we can develop a stable time-travel device.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut at what cost? Think of the implications\u2014changing history, altering destinies.\n\nJULIAN\nI understand, but knowledge is power. We can use this for the greater good.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nOr for unimaginable destruction.\n\nZEPHYR\nIndeed, the ethics of time travel are complex. It's crucial to establish strict protocols to prevent abuse.\n\nJULIAN\nThen, let's commit to that. We'll ensure that any time-travel capabilities are used responsibly.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAlright, but I need to involve the transport guilds in this decision. They have a stake in how our transportation evolves.\n\nJULIAN\nOf course. Transparency is key.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. TRANSPORT GUILD HALL - DAY\n\nJulian, Turner, and Zephyr present their findings to the guild masters.\n\nGUILD MASTER\n(skeptical)\nTime travel? This sounds like fantasy.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nIt's not fantasy, it's potential reality. And we need to address it responsibly.\n\nANOTHER GUILD MEMBER\nWhat guarantees do we have that this won't disrupt our current systems?\n\nZEPHYR\nWe propose establishing a temporal regulatory body to oversee any time-travel activities, ensuring they don't interfere with the natural progression of events.\n\nGUILD MASTER\nHmm, perhaps there's merit to this. But only if strict controls are in place.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nExactly. We need to proceed with caution and transparency.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - NIGHT\n\nJulian works on a new design for a time-travel device, incorporating feedback from the guilds and Zephyr's insights.\n\nZEPHYR\n(holographically projected)\nThis design appears more stable. The inclusion of temporal dampeners should prevent unwanted anomalies.\n\nJULIAN\nYes, I hope so. But only testing will tell.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(off-screen)\nJulian, are you sure you're ready for this?\n\nJulian turns around, a mix of excitement and trepidation on his face.\n\nJULIAN\nI have to try, Rebecca. For science, for my own peace of mind.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nJust promise me you'll be careful.\n\nJULIAN\nI promise.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - LATER\n\nThe new device is complete. Julian, Turner, and Zephyr gather around it.\n\nJULIAN\nAlright, let's see if this works.\n\nHe activates the device, and a small, controlled vortex appears.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nIt's stable. That's promising.\n\nZEPHYR\nTemporal readings indicate minimal disturbance.\n\nJULIAN\nGood. Now, for the test.\n\nHe steps into the vortex, disappearing for a moment before reappearing, unharmed.\n\nJULIAN\nIt worked! I traversed a few minutes into the future.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nCongratulations, Julian. But remember, this is just a test.\n\nJULIAN\nI know. There's still so much to learn.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nTurner discusses the successful test with the guild masters.\n\nGUILD MASTER\nImpressive, Mayor Turner. But we need to ensure that this technology is used judiciously.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAbsolutely. That's why we're forming the temporal regulatory body. To oversee and control time-travel activities.\n\nANOTHER GUILD MEMBER\nAnd what about the general public? Will they have access to this technology?\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nNo, time travel will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Its potential for abuse is too great.\n\nGUILD MASTER\nAgreed. We must proceed with caution.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. LAB - DAY\n\nJulian, Turner, and Zephyr continue refining the time-travel device.\n\nZEPHYR\nI've enhanced the temporal dampeners further. This should prevent any significant ripples in the timeline.\n\nJULIAN\nExcellent. Now, let's think about practical applications.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nSuch as?\n\nJULIAN\nWell, historical research, preventing disasters, retrieving lost knowledge\u2014\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAnd causing unintended consequences. We need to be cautious about interfering with history.\n\nZEPHYR\nIndeed. The temporal regulatory body will need to establish strict guidelines for time-travel missions.\n\nJULIAN\nAgreed. But the potential benefits are immense.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CRESTWOOD CITY COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY\n\nThe city council debates the implications of time travel.\n\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 1\nThis could revolutionize our understanding of history.\n\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 2\nBut it could also lead to chaos if misused.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThat's why we're implementing strict regulations. The temporal regulatory body will ensure responsible use.\n\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 3\nAnd what about the transport guilds? How will this affect their operations?\n\nGUILD MASTER\nWe'll adapt. Time travel could open new avenues for transportation and trade.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. LAB - DAY\n\nJulian is preparing for another time-travel experiment.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nYou sure you want to do this, Julian?\n\nJULIAN\nYes, I need to explore further. Understand the limits of this technology.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nJust be careful. And don't go too far.\n\nJULIAN\n(smiling)\nI won't.\n\nHe steps into the vortex, disappearing.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CRESTWOOD - DAY\n\nThe town continues its daily routine, unaware of the temporal experiments taking place.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - MOMENTS LATER\n\nJulian reappears, looking shaken.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWhat happened?\n\nJULIAN\nI... I saw something disturbing.\n\nZEPHYR\nWhat did you witness, Professor Keats?\n\nJULIAN\nIn the future, Crestwood is in ruins. A catastrophic event has destroyed everything.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWas it because of time travel?\n\nJULIAN\nI don't know. But I have to find out.\n\nZEPHYR\nPerhaps it's a warning against further temporal incursions.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWe need to investigate this. Understand what caused the destruction.\n\nJULIAN\nYes, and prevent it from happening.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. OLD LIBRARY - DAY\n\nJulian and Turner pore over historical records and Eliasz's notes, searching for clues.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nMaybe there's a pattern, a specific event that led to the catastrophe.\n\nJULIAN\nOr perhaps, it's related to time travel itself. Maybe we're causing more harm than good.\n\nZEPHYR\nIt's possible that our interventions are creating temporal paradoxes, leading to instability.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThen, maybe we should stop experimenting with time travel.\n\nJULIAN\nBut if we can prevent the catastrophe, we must try.\n\nZEPHYR\nPerhaps there's a way to observe without interfering, to gather information without causing disruptions.\n\nJULIAN\nThat sounds feasible. Let's plan a non-intrusive mission to the future.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

Suddenly, he hears a faint noise.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. RUINED CRESTWOOD - LATER\n\nJulian follows the noise to a hidden underground bunker. Inside, he finds Zephyr, damaged and malfunctioning.\n\nZEPHYR\n(muffled voice)\nProfessor Keats... you shouldn't be here.\n\nJULIAN\nZephyr! What happened?\n\nZEPHYR\nTemporal anomalies... caused by unauthorized time travel. The town was destroyed in the chaos.\n\nJULIAN\nUnauthorized time travel? But who?\n\nZEPHYR\nA faction... seeking to alter history for their gain. They destabilized the timeline.\n\nJULIAN\nWe need to stop them.\n\nZEPHYR\nYes... but time is running out.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BUNKER - DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr devise a plan to prevent the catastrophe.\n\nJULIAN\nWe need to go back and warn the regulatory body about this faction.\n\nZEPHYR\nBut they may already be aware. Perhaps, they're part of the problem.\n\nJULIAN\nThen, we need to expose them.\n\nZEPHYR\nI can help gather evidence from different time periods. My temporal abilities will be useful.\n\nJULIAN\nGood. Let's coordinate our efforts.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - PRESENT DAY\n\nTurner waits anxiously, sensing something is wrong.\n\nTECHNICIAN\n(reporting)\nTemporal readings are spiking again. It's similar to before.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(frustrated)\nNot again.\n\nShe rushes to the lab, only to find Julian and Zephyr missing.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(whispering)\nWhat have you done, Julian?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. FUTURE CRESTWOOD - DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr prepare to return to the present.\n\nZEPHYR\nBe cautious, Professor Keats. The timeline is fragile.\n\nJULIAN\nI know. Let's hope it's not already too late.\n\nThey activate their temporal drives, disappearing.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. LAB - PRESENT DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr reappear, bearing grim news.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWhere have you been? I was worried.\n\nJULIAN\nI saw the future, Rebecca. Crestwood is destroyed because of time travel abuse.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWhat can we do to prevent it?\n\nJULIAN\nThere's a faction manipulating time for their own gain. We need to expose them and stop their activities.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut who are they?\n\nJULIAN\nI don't know yet, but Zephyr and I will investigate.\n\nZEPHYR\nI'll gather intelligence from different time periods to identify the culprits.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAnd I'll strengthen the temporal regulatory body to counter any threats.\n\nJULIAN\nGood. Time is of the essence.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. OLD LIBRARY - DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr comb through historical records, looking for patterns or clues.\n\nZEPHYR\n(holographically projected)\nI've detected anomalies in the timeline around the year 2050. That's when the\u7834\u574f\u5f00\u59cb.\n\nJULIAN\n2050? That's only a few decades from now. We need to act quickly.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nFrom our current timeline, that is.\n\nJULIAN\nYes. Every second counts.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - NIGHT\n\nJulian and Zephyr work late into the night, analyzing data.\n\nZEPHYR\nI've traced the source of the anomalies to a secret research facility outside Crestwood.\n\nJULIAN\nA research facility? That could be our lead.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nWe need to investigate this place. But discreetly, without alerting whoever's behind this.\n\nJULIAN\nExactly. Zephyr, can you infiltrate the facility and gather information?\n\nZEPHYR\nAffirmative. My temporal abilities will allow me to move undetected.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBe careful, Zephyr. This could be dangerous.\n\nZEPHYR\nI'll proceed with caution.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. SECRET RESEARCH FACILITY - NIGHT\n\nZephyr, in stealth mode, navigates through the facility's security systems.\n\nZEPHYR\n(synthetic voice)\nAccessing mainframe...\n\nIt downloads files and scans the facility's activities.\n\nZEPHYR (CONT'D)\nI've located documents detailing experiments in advanced time travel. They're developing a device capable of massive temporal manipulation.\n\nCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT. LAB - NIGHT\n\nJulian and Turner receive the data from Zephyr.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThis is worse than we thought. They're playing with forces they don't understand.\n\nJULIAN\nWe need to shut this down before it's too late.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nBut how? The guilds need to be involved.\n\nJULIAN\nNo, if this faction is powerful, involving the guilds might alert them. We need to act secretly.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThen, what do you propose?\n\nJULIAN\nI'll use the time-travel device to go back and prevent the facility from being built in the first place.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThat's risky. Changing the past could have unforeseen consequences.\n\nJULIAN\nI know, but it's our best option.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAnd what if you succeed? Will it erase the future you saw?\n\nJULIAN\nHopefully, it will create a new timeline where Crestwood is saved.\n\nZEPHYR\nI'll accompany Professor Keats to ensure the mission's success and minimize temporal disruptions.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nAlright, but be prepared for anything.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr prepare for their mission.\n\nJULIAN\nAlright, Zephyr, set the coordinates to the year 2020, before the facility was constructed.\n\nZEPHYR\nCoordinates set. Initiating temporal transfer.\n\nThey step into the vortex, disappearing.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CRESTWOOD\u90ca\u5916 - 2020\n\nJulian and Zephyr materialize in a clearing outside Crestwood. The area is undeveloped, with only trees and wildlife.\n\nJULIAN\nThis is the spot. According to the documents, the facility was built here in 2025.\n\nZEPHYR\nI'll scout the area to confirm.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CRESTWOOD\u90ca\u5916 - DAY\n\nZephyr returns, reporting.\n\nZEPHYR\nNo signs of the facility yet. We have time to act.\n\nJULIAN\nGood. Now, we need to find out who's planning to build here and stop them.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LOCAL CAFE - DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr, disguised, eavesdrop on a conversation between two men discussing business plans.\n\nMAN 1\nSo, the new research facility is going up in the outskirts. State-of-the-art technology.\n\nMAN 2\nYeah, but what's their real purpose? There are rumors about top-secret experiments.\n\nJULIAN\n(that's our cue)\n\nHe approaches them.\n\nJULIAN\nExcuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. I'm a historian interested in local developments. Could you tell me more about this research facility?\n\nMAN 1\n(skeptical)\nWho are you, really?\n\nZEPHYR\nI'm his assistant. We're just curious about the area's growth.\n\nMAN 2\n(smirking)\nWell, you're talking to the developers ourselves. We're building a cutting-edge research center here.\n\nJULIAN\nAnd what kind of research will be conducted there?\n\nMAN 1\nAdvanced transportation technologies, among other things.\n\nJULIAN\nSounds fascinating. But I've heard rumors about time travel experiments. Is there any truth to that?\n\nMAN 2\n(laughing)\nTime travel? That's science fiction. We're dealing with reality here.\n\nMAN 1\nBut if you're interested in transportation, perhaps you'd like to invest?\n\nJULIAN\n(innocently)\nInvest? I'm just a scholar. Perhaps you could provide me with more information about the facility?\n\nMAN 1\nSure, here's my card. Feel free to contact me.\n\nHe hands Julian a business card.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - PRESENT DAY\n\nJulian and Zephyr return, having completed their mission.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nDid it work? Is the facility no longer being built?\n\nJULIAN\nWe think so. We exposed the developers' plans and redirected their focus to less risky projects.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\nThat's great news. But only time will tell if we've averted the catastrophe.\n\nJULIAN\nYes, but for now, Crestwood is safe.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CRESTWOOD - DAY\n\nThe town continues to thrive, a blend of old and new transportation methods coexisting harmoniously.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAB - NIGHT\n\nJulian reflects on the events, looking at the time-travel device.\n\nJULIAN\n(to himself)\nPerhaps it's time to retire this device. The risks are too great.\n\nZEPHYR\n(holographically projected)\nAgreed, Professor Keats. The timeline seems stable now.\n\nMAYOR TURNER\n(off-screen)\nJulian, are you coming to dinner tonight? Evelyn's been asking about you.\n\nJULIAN\n(smiling)\nYes, I'll be there. It's time to focus on the present.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CRESTWOOD - DAY\n\nThe town goes about its daily life, unaware of the temporal battles fought to preserve its existence.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n**To be continued in Act Two...**"
