        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a square garden that's surrounded by a walkway which is 3 feet wide on all sides. The total area, including the walkway, is 289 square feet, and we need to find the area of the garden alone, without the walkway.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the situation. There's a square garden, and around it, there's a walkway that's 3 feet wide all around. So, the walkway adds an extra 3 feet to each side of the garden.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the garden (just the garden, not including the walkway) as \\( s \\) feet. Since the walkway is 3 feet wide on all sides, the total side length of the garden plus the walkway would be \\( s + 2 \\times 3 \\) feet. We add 3 feet for each side of the walkway, so that's 6 feet in total added to the side of the garden.\n\nSo, the total side length is \\( s + 6 \\) feet.\n\nNow, the area of the entire garden including the walkway is given as 289 square feet. Since it's a square, the area is the side length squared. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n(s + 6)^2 = 289\n\\]\n\nOkay, so now I need to solve for \\( s \\).\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\ns + 6 = \\sqrt{289}\n\\]\n\nI know that \\( \\sqrt{289} = 17 \\), because \\( 17 \\times 17 = 289 \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\ns + 6 = 17\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides:\n\n\\[\ns = 17 - 6 = 11\n\\]\n\nSo, the side length of the garden is 11 feet.\n\nNow, to find the area of the garden alone, I just square the side length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the garden} = s^2 = 11^2 = 121 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the walkway as a border around the garden. So, the total area is the area of the garden plus the area of the walkway.\n\nBut in this problem, it's easier to consider the total side length including the walkway, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the walkway adding 3 feet on each side, so the total addition is 6 feet to the side length of the garden.\n\nSo, if the garden's side is \\( s \\), total side is \\( s + 6 \\), and the area is \\( (s + 6)^2 = 289 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( s \\), as I did, gives \\( s = 11 \\) feet, and the area is \\( 121 \\) square feet.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I calculate the area of the walkway alone. The area of the walkway would be the total area minus the area of the garden:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of walkway} = 289 - s^2\n\\]\n\nBut I don't know the area of the walkway, so that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the area of the walkway by considering it as four rectangles and corners, but that seems more complicated for this problem.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct. Let me try plugging the numbers back to verify.\n\nIf the garden is 11 feet on a side, and the walkway is 3 feet wide on all sides, then the total side length is \\( 11 + 6 = 17 \\) feet, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAnd \\( 17^2 = 289 \\) square feet, which matches the given total area.\n\nSo, the area of the garden alone is indeed \\( 11^2 = 121 \\) square feet.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{121} \\]"
