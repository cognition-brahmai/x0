        "content": "Let's see here. The text says that stress management techniques vary depending on individual needs and circumstances. It mentions that some people find physical activities like yoga or jogging effective, while others prefer mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing. It also notes that a balanced diet and adequate sleep are important for managing stress.\n\nSo, for the multiple-choice question:\n\nA. Physical activity is the most effective method for reducing stress.\n\nWell, the text says that different things work for different people. It doesn't say that physical activity is the most effective for everyone. In fact, it suggests that some people might find mindfulness practices more beneficial. So, A seems incorrect.\n\nB. Mindfulness practices are only useful for individuals who do not engage in physical activity.\n\nThat doesn't make sense based on what's written. The text presents physical activity and mindfulness practices as two different options that different people might prefer, not as mutually exclusive choices. So, B seems wrong.\n\nC. Different methods of stress management may work better for different individuals.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the first sentence of the text, which says that stress management techniques vary depending on individual needs and circumstances. So, C looks like a good choice.\n\nD. Diet and sleep have no effect on stress levels.\n\nBut the text explicitly states that maintaining a balanced diet and ensuring adequate sleep are crucial for managing stress. So, D is clearly incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Different methods of stress management may work better for different individuals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
