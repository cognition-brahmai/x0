So, Alice > Bob.\n\nNext, Bob is younger than Carol. So, Carol > Bob.\n\nThen, Dave is older than Alice but younger than Carol. So, Carol > Dave > Alice.\n\nNow, let's put all these together.\n\nFrom Alice > Bob and Dave > Alice, we can say Dave > Alice > Bob.\n\nAlso, Carol is older than Dave, so Carol > Dave > Alice > Bob.\n\nSo, the order from oldest to youngest is Carol, Dave, Alice, Bob.\n\nTherefore, Bob is the youngest among them.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nAlice is older than Bob: A > B.\n\nBob is younger than Carol: C > B.\n\nDave is older than Alice but younger than Carol: C > D > A.\n\nSo, combining these, we have C > D > A > B.\n\nYes, Bob is the youngest.\n\nI think that's clear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bob}} \\]"
