        "content": "So I need to calculate the surface area of a sphere that has a radius of 6 cm. I remember there's a formula for this, but I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the surface area of a sphere. I think it involves the radius and pi. Hmm, let's see. I believe the formula is something like 4 times pi times the radius squared. So, maybe it's 4\u03c0r\u00b2. Yes, that sounds right.\n\nTo make sure, I can check this against what I know about other shapes. For example, the surface area of a cube is 6 times the square of its side length. So, for a sphere, it makes sense that there's a similar relationship, but with a different constant factor. In this case, the constant is 4\u03c0.\n\nOkay, so the formula is 4\u03c0r\u00b2. Now, I need to plug in the radius, which is 6 cm.\n\nSo, surface area (SA) = 4\u03c0(6 cm)\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I'll square the radius: 6 cm \u00d7 6 cm = 36 cm\u00b2.\n\nThen, multiply that by \u03c0: 36 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 \u03c0 = 36\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nFinally, multiply by 4: 4 \u00d7 36\u03c0 cm\u00b2 = 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nNow, if I need a numerical value, I can approximate \u03c0 as 3.1416.\n\nSo, SA \u2248 144 \u00d7 3.1416 cm\u00b2.\n\nLet me calculate that: 144 \u00d7 3.1416 = 144 \u00d7 3.1416.\n\nFirst, 144 \u00d7 3 = 432.\n\nThen, 144 \u00d7 0.1416. Let's break it down:\n\n144 \u00d7 0.1 = 14.4\n\n144 \u00d7 0.04 = 5.76\n\n144 \u00d7 0.001 = 0.144\n\n144 \u00d7 0.0006 = 0.0864\n\nAdding those up: 14.4 + 5.76 = 20.16, plus 0.144 = 20.304, plus 0.0864 = 20.3904.\n\nSo, total is 432 + 20.3904 = 452.3904 cm\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the surface area is approximately 452.39 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut since the problem gave the radius as 6 cm, which is a whole number, maybe it's okay to leave the answer in terms of \u03c0.\n\nSo, SA = 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nThat's probably the most precise answer, without approximating \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, if more decimal places are needed, I could use a more precise value of \u03c0.\n\nBut for most practical purposes, 452.39 cm\u00b2 is fine.\n\nLet me double-check the formula just to be sure. I recall that the surface area of a sphere is indeed 4\u03c0r\u00b2. I can confirm this by looking it up in a geometry textbook or online, but since I'm supposed to work through this step by step, I'll trust my memory for now.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the surface area of a sphere as being made up of many small patches, each of which can be approximated as a flat surface. As the number of patches increases, the approximation becomes better, and the total surface area approaches 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the fact that the surface area of a sphere is four times the area of its great circle. A great circle is a circle on the sphere's surface that has the same diameter as the sphere itself. The area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, so four times that would be 4\u03c0r\u00b2, which matches the formula I'm using.\n\nSo, that gives me more confidence that the formula is correct.\n\nNow, plugging in the radius again: r = 6 cm.\n\nSA = 4\u03c0(6 cm)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0(36 cm\u00b2) = 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nApproximating \u03c0 as 3.1416, SA \u2248 144 \u00d7 3.1416 = 452.3904 cm\u00b2.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, SA \u2248 452.39 cm\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, if more precision is needed, I could use more decimal places for \u03c0.\n\nBut for now, I'll stick with 452.39 cm\u00b2.\n\nI should also consider the units. Since we're dealing with area, the units should be squared. In this case, it's cm\u00b2, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the problem expects the answer in terms of \u03c0 or as a decimal. Since it didn't specify, I'll provide both: 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2 or approximately 452.39 cm\u00b2.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also check the calculation for multiplying 144 by \u03c0.\n\nUsing a calculator, 144 \u00d7 3.1415926535 = 452.3893424 cm\u00b2.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, it's indeed 452.39 cm\u00b2.\n\nSo, I'm confident with this answer.\n\nIn summary, the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 6 cm is 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2, or approximately 452.39 cm\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144\\pi \\text{ cm}^2 \\approx 452.39 \\text{ cm}^2} \\]"
