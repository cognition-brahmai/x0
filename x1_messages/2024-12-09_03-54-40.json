        "content": "Let's see. So, I've got this problem here about driving at different speeds for different amounts of time and needing to find out the total distance traveled. Okay, I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, maybe I can break this down into parts.\n\nFirst, I'm driving at 55 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, the distance for that part should be 55 mph times 3 hours. Let me do the math: 55 times 3 is 165 miles. So, that's the first part.\n\nThen, I increase my speed to 70 mph for another 2 hours. So, for this part, the distance should be 70 mph times 2 hours. That's 70 times 2, which is 140 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add those two distances together: 165 miles plus 140 miles. That's pretty straightforward: 165 plus 140 is 305 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider, like acceleration or something? But since the problem says \"average speed,\" I think it's okay to assume that the speed is constant during each segment.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Here, both speeds are in miles per hour, and times are in hours, so everything matches up.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to be sure. First part: 55 mph times 3 hours is indeed 165 miles. Second part: 70 mph times 2 hours is 140 miles. Adding them up gives 305 miles.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it differently. Maybe use the formula for total distance when speeds and times are different for segments.\n\nSo, total distance equals the sum of distances of each segment. Which is exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the average speed for the entire trip and then multiply by total time, but that seems more complicated and prone to error, especially since the speeds are different for different durations.\n\nNo, I think my initial approach is correct. So, the total distance traveled is 305 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{305} \\]"
