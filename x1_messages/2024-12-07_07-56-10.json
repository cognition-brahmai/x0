Tungsten is indeed used to create filaments in incandescent light bulbs because of its high melting point, which allows it to withstand the high temperatures required to produce light without melting or degrading quickly. Its high melting point is around 3,422 degrees Celsius (6,192 degrees Fahrenheit), making it one of the highest among all metals, which is why it's ideal for such applications."
