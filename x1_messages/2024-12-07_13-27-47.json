        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with houses on both sides of the street. One side has 10 houses, and the other has 15 houses. That means there are a total of 10 + 15 = 25 houses altogether.\n\nNow, every house has at least one dog. So, if every house had exactly one dog, the total number of dogs would be equal to the number of houses, which is 25 dogs.\n\nBut, the problem states that there are 40 dogs in total. That means there are 40 - 25 = 15 extra dogs beyond the one dog per house.\n\nSo, these 15 extra dogs must be distributed among some of the houses, meaning those houses will have more than one dog.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses that have more than one dog is equal to the number of extra dogs, which is 15.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? If a house has more than one dog, it could have more than just one extra dog. For example, a house could have two dogs (one required and one extra), or three dogs (one required and two extra), and so on.\n\nSo, if we have 15 extra dogs, and each house that has more than one dog must have at least one extra dog, then the minimum number of houses with more than one dog is 15, assuming each of those houses has exactly one extra dog.\n\nBut, if some houses have more than one extra dog, then the number of houses with more than one dog would be less than 15.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify how many extra dogs each house has, only that every house has at least one dog and that there are 40 dogs in total.\n\nSo, to find the number of houses with more than one dog, we can think of it this way:\n\nTotal dogs = dogs in houses with exactly one dog + dogs in houses with more than one dog.\n\nLet\u2019s let H be the number of houses with exactly one dog, and M be the number of houses with more than one dog.\n\nWe know that H + M = 25, since there are 25 houses in total.\n\nThe total number of dogs is:\n\nD = H * 1 + M * (1 + E), where E is the average number of extra dogs per house with more than one dog.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that every house has at least one dog. So, if we assign one dog to each house, that accounts for 25 dogs. The remaining 15 dogs must be distributed among some of the houses, meaning those houses will have more than one dog.\n\nSo, if we have 15 extra dogs, and each house that gets at least one extra dog will have more than one dog.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses with more than one dog is equal to the number of houses that receive at least one extra dog.\n\nSince we have 15 extra dogs to distribute among the houses, and each house that gets at least one extra dog is counted as having more than one dog, the minimum number of houses with more than one dog is 15, if each of those houses gets exactly one extra dog.\n\nHowever, if some houses get more than one extra dog, then the number of houses with more than one dog would be less than 15.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how the extra dogs are distributed, so we can't determine the exact number of houses with more than one dog unless we assume that each such house gets exactly one extra dog.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it in terms of equations.\n\nLet H be the number of houses with exactly one dog, and M be the number of houses with more than one dog.\n\nWe know that H + M = 25.\n\nLet\u2019s let D be the total number of dogs, which is 40.\n\nThe total number of dogs can also be expressed as:\n\nD = H * 1 + M * (1 + E), where E is the average number of extra dogs per house with more than one dog.\n\nBut again, this introduces another variable.\n\nAlternatively, since we don't know E, maybe we can consider that each house with more than one dog has at least one extra dog, and possibly more.\n\nSo, the total number of extra dogs is 15, and these are distributed among M houses, each getting at least one extra dog.\n\nTherefore, M is at least 15, but could be less if some houses have more than one extra dog.\n\nHowever, since H + M = 25, and H is the number of houses with exactly one dog, then M = 25 - H.\n\nThe total number of dogs is:\n\nD = H * 1 + M * (1 + E) = H + M + M * E = 25 + M * E = 40.\n\nSo, M * E = 15.\n\nBut again, without knowing E, we can't find M.\n\nAlternatively, since each house with more than one dog has at least one extra dog, the minimum number of houses with more than one dog is 15, as in the earlier thought.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to look at it.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that if all 25 houses had exactly one dog, there would be 25 dogs.\n\nBut there are 40 dogs, so there are 15 extra dogs.\n\nIf we distribute these 15 extra dogs to some houses, each house can receive one or more extra dogs.\n\nThe number of houses that receive at least one extra dog is the number of houses with more than one dog.\n\nSo, if we distribute 15 extra dogs, and each of these houses gets at least one extra dog, then the number of houses with more than one dog is at least 15.\n\nBut without knowing how the extra dogs are distributed, we can't determine the exact number.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem implies that each house has exactly one extra dog, making the number of houses with more than one dog equal to 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some houses have more than one extra dog, reducing the number of houses needed to account for the 15 extra dogs.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the answer is that at least 15 houses have more than one dog.\n\nHowever, the problem seems to be expecting a specific number, so perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose we have 25 houses, each with at least one dog.\n\nTotal dogs are 40.\n\nWe can think of the minimum number of houses that must have more than one dog to account for the extra dogs.\n\nIf we have 15 houses with exactly two dogs, that would account for 15 * 2 = 30 dogs, and the remaining 10 houses have one dog each, accounting for 10 dogs, for a total of 40 dogs.\n\nIn this case, the number of houses with more than one dog is 15.\n\nAlternatively, if we have 10 houses with three dogs each, that's 10 * 3 = 30 dogs, and the remaining 15 houses have one dog each, accounting for 15 dogs, totaling 45 dogs, which is too many.\n\nWait, 45 is more than 40, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, if we have some houses with more than two dogs, it would require fewer houses to account for the extra dogs.\n\nFor example, if we have five houses with four dogs each, that's 5 * 4 = 20 dogs, and the remaining 20 houses have one dog each, accounting for 20 dogs, totaling 40 dogs.\n\nIn this case, the number of houses with more than one dog is five.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with the earlier thought that at least 15 houses have more than one dog.\n\nHold on, perhaps I need to think in terms of minimal and maximal number of houses with more than one dog.\n\nGiven that, in the first scenario, 15 houses have exactly two dogs, and the remaining 10 have one dog each, totaling 40 dogs.\n\nIn the second scenario, five houses have four dogs each, and 20 have one dog each, also totaling 40 dogs.\n\nSo, the number of houses with more than one dog can vary between five and 15, depending on how the extra dogs are distributed.\n\nBut the problem seems to be asking for a specific number, suggesting that there's a definitive answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nPerhaps the problem is simply asking for the number of houses that have more than one dog, given that there are 40 dogs in total and 25 houses, each with at least one dog.\n\nSo, the number of extra dogs is 40 - 25 = 15.\n\nIf each house with more than one dog has exactly one extra dog, then there are 15 such houses.\n\nBut if some houses have more than one extra dog, then the number of houses with more than one dog would be less than 15.\n\nHowever, without additional information on how the extra dogs are distributed, the problem might be expecting the minimal number of houses with more than one dog.\n\nWait, but in the scenario where some houses have more than one extra dog, the number could be less than 15.\n\nFor instance, if three houses have five dogs each, that's 3 * 5 = 15 dogs, and the remaining 22 houses have one dog each, accounting for 22 dogs, totaling 37 dogs, which is less than 40.\n\nSo, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to readjust.\n\nIf three houses have five dogs each, that's 15 dogs, and the remaining 22 houses have one dog each, that's 22 dogs, totaling 37 dogs, which is less than 40.\n\nTo make it 40, we need three more dogs.\n\nSo, perhaps two houses have five dogs each, and one house has six dogs, totaling 2*5 + 1*6 = 10 + 6 = 16 dogs from these three houses, and the remaining 22 houses have one dog each, accounting for 22 dogs, totaling 38 dogs, still two short.\n\nSo, maybe one house has seven dogs, and two houses have five dogs each, totaling 7 + 5 + 5 = 17 dogs from these three houses, and the remaining 22 houses have one dog each, accounting for 22 dogs, totaling 39 dogs, still one short.\n\nSo, perhaps one house has eight dogs, and two houses have five dogs each, totaling 8 + 5 + 5 = 18 dogs from these three houses, and the remaining 22 houses have one dog each, accounting for 22 dogs, totaling 40 dogs.\n\nIn this case, only three houses have more than one dog.\n\nWait, but this seems to contradict the earlier thought that at least 15 houses have more than one dog.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal number of houses with more than one dog is three, and the maximal is 15.\n\nBut this is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the minimal number of houses with more than one dog.\n\nTo minimize the number of houses with more than one dog, we need to maximize the number of extra dogs per house.\n\nSo, if we have as many extra dogs as possible in each house with more than one dog, we can minimize the number of such houses.\n\nConversely, to maximize the number of houses with more than one dog, we assign only one extra dog to each such house.\n\nSo, for the minimal number:\n\nIf one house has as many extra dogs as possible, the maximum number of extra dogs one house can have is 40 - 24 = 16 dogs (since 24 houses have one dog each), but that seems off.\n\nWait, if 24 houses have one dog each, that's 24 dogs, and one house has the remaining 16 dogs, making a total of 40 dogs.\n\nIn this case, only one house has more than one dog.\n\nWait, but the problem states that every house has at least one dog, so even if one house has 16 dogs, it's still only one house with more than one dog.\n\nSo, the minimal number of houses with more than one dog is one.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 15.\n\nHmm, seems I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nIf one house has 16 dogs, and the other 24 houses have one dog each, total dogs are 16 + 24*1 = 40.\n\nSo, only one house has more than one dog.\n\nAlternatively, if two houses have extra dogs, say two houses have eight extra dogs each, that's 16 dogs, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nWait, let's think properly.\n\nIf one house has 16 dogs, and the other 24 have one each, total is 40, and only one house has more than one dog.\n\nAlternatively, if two houses have extra dogs, say one house has nine extra dogs and another has seven extra dogs, that's 16 extra dogs, making total dogs 25 + 15 = 40.\n\nWait, 25 base dogs plus 15 extra dogs.\n\nWait, no, 25 base dogs plus 15 extra dogs equals 40.\n\nBut if two houses have extra dogs, and they have a total of 15 extra dogs between them, that's possible.\n\nFor example, one house has eight extra dogs, the other has seven, totaling 15 extra dogs.\n\nSo, only two houses have more than one dog.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of one house having 16 extra dogs, making only one house with more than one dog.\n\nWait, no, that wouldn't make sense because 25 base dogs plus 15 extra dogs is 40.\n\nIf one house has 15 extra dogs, plus one base dog, that's 16 dogs in one house, and the other 24 houses have one dog each, totaling 24 + 16 = 40 dogs.\n\nSo, only one house has more than one dog.\n\nAlternatively, if 15 houses each have one extra dog, that's 15 extra dogs, plus 25 base dogs, totaling 40 dogs.\n\nIn this case, 15 houses have more than one dog.\n\nSo, the number of houses with more than one dog can range from one to 15, depending on how the extra dogs are distributed.\n\nBut the problem seems to be expecting a specific number.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"In a town, there are 10 houses on one side of the street and 15 houses on the other side. If every house has at least one dog, and the total number of dogs in all the houses is 40, how many houses have more than one dog?\"\n\nSo, there are 25 houses in total, each with at least one dog, and 40 dogs in total.\n\nThe number of extra dogs is 40 - 25 = 15.\n\nEach house with more than one dog must have at least one extra dog.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of houses with more than one dog is when each such house has as many extra dogs as possible.\n\nBut theoretically, one house could have all 15 extra dogs, making only one house with more than one dog.\n\nAlternatively, if each house with more than one dog has only one extra dog, then there would be 15 houses with more than one dog.\n\nSo, the number of houses with more than one dog can be anywhere from one to 15, depending on the distribution of the extra dogs.\n\nBut the problem seems to be expecting a single answer, suggesting that there is a definitive number.\n\nPerhaps there's a constraint I'm missing, related to the arrangement of the houses on both sides of the street.\n\nThe problem mentions that there are 10 houses on one side and 15 on the other, but doesn't provide any further information about how the dogs are distributed between the two sides.\n\nSo, unless there's additional information, the number of houses with more than one dog isn't fixed; it can vary based on how the extra dogs are distributed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is implying that the distribution is uniform, but that seems unlikely.\n\nPerhaps the question is simply asking for the number of houses that have more than one dog, given the total number of dogs and houses, and assuming that the extra dogs are distributed in a certain way.\n\nBut without specified distribution, it's hard to pin down a single number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of average number of dogs per house.\n\nTotal dogs are 40, houses are 25, so average is 40 / 25 = 1.6 dogs per house.\n\nBut since each house has at least one dog, the average of 1.6 suggests that some houses have more than one dog to bring the average up.\n\nBut again, without knowing how the dogs are distributed, I can't determine the exact number of houses with more than one dog.\n\nPerhaps the problem is expecting a range, but since it asks for a specific number, I must have missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nLet me try another angle.\n\nSuppose all 25 houses have exactly one dog. That accounts for 25 dogs.\n\nBut there are 40 dogs in total, so there are 15 extra dogs.\n\nEach extra dog must be in one of the houses, increasing the number of dogs in those houses beyond one.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses with more than one dog is equal to the number of extra dogs, assuming each such house has exactly one extra dog.\n\nIn this case, that would be 15 houses with more than one dog.\n\nHowever, if some houses have more than one extra dog, then the number of houses with more than one dog would be less than 15.\n\nBut without additional information, the safest assumption is that each house with more than one dog has exactly one extra dog.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses with more than one dog is 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the minimal number of houses with more than one dog, which would be one, as discussed earlier.\n\nBut that seems too low, given the numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify whether to find the minimal, maximal, or exact number.\n\nIt simply asks, \"how many houses have more than one dog?\"\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the distribution of extra dogs, it's unclear what the exact number is without making assumptions.\n\nPerhaps the problem is designed to illustrate that the number can vary based on the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nLet me consider that the 10 houses on one side and 15 on the other side might have different numbers of dogs, but the problem doesn't specify any difference between the two sides.\n\nTherefore, without loss of generality, we can consider all 25 houses uniformly.\n\nGiven that, the number of houses with more than one dog is equal to the number of extra dogs if each such house has exactly one extra dog.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15 houses have more than one dog.\n\nAlternatively, if some houses have more than one extra dog, the number could be less, but the problem likely expects the assumption that each house with more than one dog has exactly one extra dog.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15 houses have more than one dog.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
