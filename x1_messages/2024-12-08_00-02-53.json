        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 apples, 7 oranges, and 9 bananas. I need to find the probability of picking one apple and one orange at the same time without looking. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of fruits in the box. That should be 5 apples plus 7 oranges plus 9 bananas, which totals 21 fruits.\n\nNow, since I'm picking two fruits at once, I think this is a combination problem because the order doesn't matter. So, the total number of ways to pick any two fruits from 21 is calculated using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{21}{2} = \\frac{21!}{2!(21-2)!} = \\frac{21 \\times 20}{2} = 210\n\\]\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to pick one apple and one orange. Since there are 5 apples and 7 oranges, the number of ways to pick one apple and one orange is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = 5 \\times 7 = 35\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? I'm multiplying the number of apples by the number of oranges to get the combinations of one apple and one orange.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{apple and orange}) = \\frac{35}{210} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using probabilities sequentially.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the probability of picking an apple first and then an orange, plus the probability of picking an orange first and then an apple.\n\nThe probability of picking an apple first is 5/21, and then picking an orange is 7/20, because one fruit has already been picked.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking an orange first is 7/21, and then picking an apple is 5/20.\n\nSo, the total probability would be:\n\n\\[\nP = \\left(\\frac{5}{21} \\times \\frac{7}{20}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{7}{21} \\times \\frac{5}{20}\\right) = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{5 \\times 7}{21 \\times 20}\\right) = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{35}{420}\\right) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result. So, the probability is indeed 1/6.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider whether the fruits are being picked simultaneously or sequentially. In probability, picking two items at once is equivalent to picking them one after the other without replacement, which is what I just did.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is 1/6.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
