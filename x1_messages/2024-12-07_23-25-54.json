        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Golang application that interacts with a Memcached server. The app should allow users to store and retrieve key-value pairs via a command-line interface. I'm excited to work on this, but I need to make sure I understand all the requirements and steps involved.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up my environment. I'll need Go installed on my machine, and I should also have Memcached installed and running. I think Memcached typically runs on port 11211, so I'll make sure that's available.\n\nNext, I need to find a Go package that allows me to interact with Memcached. A quick search suggests that \"github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache\" is a popular choice. I'll use that for this project.\n\nNow, let's think about the command-line interface. What operations do I want to support? At the very least, I need commands to set a key-value pair, get a value by key, and maybe delete a key. It might also be useful to have a command to list all keys in the cache, but I'm not sure if Memcached supports that directly.\n\nHmm, Memcached is designed for caching, so it's optimized for fast get and set operations. It doesn't support complex queries or listing all keys efficiently, as that would defeat the purpose of caching. So, I might have to skip the \"list all keys\" feature or implement it in a way that's not performance-heavy.\n\nLet me sketch out a basic structure for the application:\n\n- The main function will parse command-line arguments to determine which operation to perform.\n\n- For setting a key-value pair, I'll need to accept a key and a value from the user.\n\n- For getting a value, I'll need the key.\n\n- For deleting a key, again, just the key.\n\nI should also handle errors gracefully, like if the Memcached server is not running or if there are issues with the network.\n\nLet me start by initializing a new Go module and creating the main package.\n\n```\nmkdir memcached-cli\ncd memcached-cli\ngo mod init github.com/yourusername/memcached-cli\n```\n\nNow, I'll create a main.go file.\n\nI need to import the necessary packages:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\n\t\"github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache\"\n)\n```\n\nI'll define some constants for the Memcached server address.\n\n```go\nconst (\n\tmemcachedAddr = \"127.0.0.1:11211\"\n)\n```\n\nI should consider making the server address configurable via an environment variable or a command-line flag, but for simplicity, I'll hardcode it for now.\n\nNext, I'll create a memcache.Client instance.\n\n```go\nvar mc *memcache.Client\n\nfunc init() {\n mc = memcache.New(memcachedAddr)\n if mc == nil {\n log.Fatal(\"Failed to connect to Memcached server\")\n }\n}\n```\n\nWait, actually, memcache.New returns a slice of *memcache.Client, but I think it's meant to be used with multiple servers. Maybe I should use memcache.New(\"127.0.0.1:11211\") directly.\n\nLet me check the documentation.\n\nAh, yes, memcache.New takes a list of server addresses and returns a *memcache.Client.\n\nSo, it should be:\n\n```go\nmc := memcache.New(memcachedAddr)\n```\n\nI don't need to check if mc is nil because New won't return nil unless there are no servers specified.\n\nNow, I need to define the commands. I'll use Go's flag package to parse command-line arguments.\n\nPossible commands:\n\n- set: to set a key-value pair\n\n- get: to get a value by key\n\n- delete: to delete a key\n\nI'll use flag.StringVar to capture the command and other necessary parameters.\n\nLet me define the flags.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n cmd := flag.String(\"cmd\", \"\", \"Command to execute (set, get, delete)\")\n key := flag.String(\"key\", \"\", \"Key for the operation\")\n value := flag.String(\"value\", \"\", \"Value to set (only for set command)\")\n\n flag.Parse()\n\n if *cmd == \"\" || *key == \"\" {\n log.Fatal(\"Command and key are required\")\n }\n\n switch *cmd {\n case \"set\":\n if *value == \"\" {\n log.Fatal(\"Value is required for set command\")\n }\n set(*key, *value)\n case \"get\":\n get(*key)\n case \"delete\":\n delete(*key)\n default:\n log.Fatal(\"Invalid command. Supported commands: set, get, delete\")\n }\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to implement the set, get, and delete functions.\n\nStarting with set:\n\n```go\nfunc set(key, value string) {\n item := &memcache.Item{\n Key: key,\n Value: []byte(value),\n }\n err := mc.Set(item)\n if err != nil {\n log.Fatalf(\"Failed to set key %s: %v\", key, err)\n }\n fmt.Println(\"Key set successfully\")\n}\n```\n\nFor get:\n\n```go\nfunc get(key string) {\n item, err := mc.Get(key)\n if err != nil {\n if err == memcache.ErrCacheMiss {\n fmt.Println(\"Key not found\")\n } else {\n log.Fatalf(\"Failed to get key %s: %v\", key, err)\n }\n return\n }\n fmt.Printf(\"Value: %s\\n\", item.Value)\n}\n```\n\nAnd for delete:\n\n```go\nfunc delete(key string) {\n err := mc.Delete(key)\n if err != nil {\n if err == memcache.ErrCacheMiss {\n fmt.Println(\"Key not found\")\n } else {\n log.Fatalf(\"Failed to delete key %s: %v\", key, err)\n }\n }\n fmt.Println(\"Key deleted successfully\")\n}\n```\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, I should test this application to make sure it works as expected.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure Memcached is installed and running on my machine.\n\nOn Ubuntu, I can install it using:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install memcached\n```\n\nThen, start the server:\n\n```\nsudo service memcached start\n```\n\nI can check if it's running with:\n\n```\nsudo service memcached status\n```\n\nAssuming it's running, I can try to set a key:\n\n```\ngo run main.go -cmd=set -key=mykey -value=myvalue\n```\n\nThen, get the key:\n\n```\ngo run main.go -cmd=get -key=mykey\n```\n\nAnd delete it:\n\n```\ngo run main.go -cmd=delete -key=mykey\n```\n\nI should also handle cases where the key doesn't exist for get and delete operations.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to handle more Memcached features, like setting expiration times for keys, but that can be added later as an enhancement.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that Memcached stores values as byte slices, so I need to handle any necessary encoding or decoding if the values are not plain strings.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and assume that values are plain strings.\n\nI should also think about error handling. For example, if the Memcached server is down, the application should inform the user appropriately.\n\nIn the init function, I can attempt to connect to the Memcached server and log an error if it fails.\n\nWait, but memcache.New doesn't require an immediate connection. It delays connecting until the first operation.\n\nSo, I should move the connection attempt to the first operation.\n\nLet me modify the init function:\n\n```go\nfunc init() {\n mc = memcache.New(memcachedAddr)\n}\n```\n\nAnd in each function (set, get, delete), I can wrap the operation in a defer-recover block to handle connection errors.\n\nActually, the memcache package handles errors gracefully, so I can rely on the error returns from the Set, Get, and Delete methods.\n\nI should also consider adding a connection timeout, so that if the Memcached server is not responding, the application doesn't hang indefinitely.\n\nI can set the Timeout field of the memcache.Client.\n\n```go\nmc := memcache.New(memcachedAddr)\nmc.Timeout = time.Second * 5\n```\n\nI need to import the \"time\" package for that.\n\nSimilarly, I can set other options like the DialTimeout.\n\nLet me look up the memcache.Client documentation to see what options are available.\n\nFrom the documentation, I can see that memcache.Client has fields like DialTimeout and Timeout that I can set.\n\nSo, I'll add those configurations.\n\n```go\nimport (\n \"flag\"\n \"fmt\"\n \"log\"\n \"time\"\n\n \"github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache\"\n)\n\nconst (\n memcachedAddr = \"127.0.0.1:11211\"\n)\n\nvar mc *memcache.Client\n\nfunc init() {\n mc = memcache.New(memcachedAddr)\n mc.DialTimeout = time.Second * 5\n mc.Timeout = time.Second * 5\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n cmd := flag.String(\"cmd\", \"\", \"Command to execute (set, get, delete)\")\n key := flag.String(\"key\", \"\", \"Key for the operation\")\n value := flag.String(\"value\", \"\", \"Value to set (only for set command)\")\n\n flag.Parse()\n\n if *cmd == \"\" || *key == \"\" {\n log.Fatal(\"Command and key are required\")\n }\n\n switch *cmd {\n case \"set\":\n if *value == \"\" {\n log.Fatal(\"Value is required for set command\")\n }\n set(*key, *value)\n case \"get\":\n get(*key)\n case \"delete\":\n delete(*key)\n default:\n log.Fatal(\"Invalid command. Supported commands: set, get, delete\")\n }\n}\n\nfunc set(key, value string) {\n item := &memcache.Item{\n Key: key,\n Value: []byte(value),\n }\n err := mc.Set(item)\n if err != nil {\n log.Fatalf(\"Failed to set key %s: %v\", key, err)\n }\n fmt.Println(\"Key set successfully\")\n}\n\nfunc get(key string) {\n item, err := mc.Get(key)\n if err != nil {\n if err == memcache.ErrCacheMiss {\n fmt.Println(\"Key not found\")\n } else {\n log.Fatalf(\"Failed to get key %s: %v\", key, err)\n }\n return\n }\n fmt.Printf(\"Value: %s\\n\", item.Value)\n}\n\nfunc delete(key string) {\n err := mc.Delete(key)\n if err != nil {\n if err == memcache.ErrCacheMiss {\n fmt.Println(\"Key not found\")\n } else {\n log.Fatalf(\"Failed to delete key %s: %v\", key, err)\n }\n }\n fmt.Println(\"Key deleted successfully\")\n}\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic functionality. I can further enhance this by adding more features, like setting expiration times for keys, handling binary data, or even adding a simple CLI loop for interactive use.\n\nBut for now, this should satisfy the initial requirements.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Golang application that interacts with a Memcached server to store and retrieve key-value pairs via a command-line interface, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Go installed** on your machine.\n2. **Memcached installed and running** on your machine, typically on port 11211.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache\"\n)\n\nconst (\n\tmemcachedAddr = \"127.0.0.1:11211\"\n)\n\nvar mc *memcache.Client\n\nfunc init() {\n\tmc = memcache.New(memcachedAddr)\n\tmc.DialTimeout = time.Second * 5\n\tmc.Timeout = time.Second * 5\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tcmd := flag.String(\"cmd\", \"\", \"Command to execute (set, get, delete)\")\n\tkey := flag.String(\"key\", \"\", \"Key for the operation\")\n\tvalue := flag.String(\"value\", \"\", \"Value to set (only for set command)\")\n\n\tflag.Parse()\n\n\tif *cmd == \"\" || *key == \"\" {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Command and key are required\")\n\t}\n\n\tswitch *cmd {\n\tcase \"set\":\n\t\tif *value == \"\" {\n\t\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Value is required for set command\")\n\t\t}\n\t\tset(*key, *value)\n\tcase \"get\":\n\t\tget(*key)\n\tcase \"delete\":\n\t\tdelete(*key)\n\tdefault:\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Invalid command.
