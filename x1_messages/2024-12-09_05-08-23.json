        "content": "To implement a Python program that uses the OpenCV library to detect faces in images, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already.\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install opencv-python\n    ```\n\n2. **Load the Haar Cascade Classifier**: OpenCV comes with pretrained Haar cascades for face detection. You'll need to load this classifier.\n\n3. **Read the Input Image**: Use OpenCV to read the image file provided by the user.\n\n4. **Convert to Grayscale**: The face detection algorithm works on grayscale images.\n\n5. **Detect Faces**: Use the classifier to detect faces in the grayscale image.\n\n6. **Draw Bounding Boxes**: For each detected face, draw a rectangle around it on the original color image.\n\n7. **Save the Resulting Image**: Save the image with bounding boxes to the specified directory.\n\nHere's a sample code that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndef detect_faces(input_image_path, output_directory):\n    # Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier\n    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')\n    \n    # Read the input image\n    img = cv2.imread(input_image_path)\n    if img is None:\n        print(\"Error: Could not read the image.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Convert the image to grayscale\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n    \n    # Detect faces in the image\n    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))\n    \n    # Draw bounding boxes around the detected faces\n    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:\n        cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)\n    \n    # Save the resulting image\n    base_name = os.path.basename(input_image_path)\n    output_path = os.path.join(output_directory, f\"detected_{base_name}\")\n    cv2.imwrite(output_path, img)\n    print(f\"Saved the resulting image to {output_path}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if len(sys.argv) != 3:\n        print(\"Usage: python face_detector.py <input_image_path> <output_directory>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    input_image_path = sys.argv[1]\n    output_directory = sys.argv[2]\n    \n    if not os.path.exists(output_directory):\n        os.makedirs(output_directory)\n    \n    detect_faces(input_image_path, output_directory)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loading the Classifier**: The `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` is a pre-trained model for detecting front-facing human faces.\n   \n2. **Reading and Converting the Image**: The input image is read using `cv2.imread()`, and converted to grayscale because the face detection algorithm works on grayscale images.\n\n3. **Detecting Faces**: The `detectMultiScale` function detects faces of different sizes in the input image. The parameters `scaleFactor`, `minNeighbors`, and `minSize` are used to fine-tune the detection process.\n\n4. **Drawing Bounding Boxes**: For each detected face, a blue rectangle is drawn on the original color image.\n\n5. **Saving the Result**: The modified image is saved in the specified output directory with a prefix \"detected_\" added to the original filename.\n\n### Usage:\n\nRun the script from the command line by providing the path to the input image and the output directory.\n\n```bash\npython face_detector.py path/to/input/image.jpg path/to/output/directory\n```\n\nThis will process the image and save the output with detected faces in the specified directory."
