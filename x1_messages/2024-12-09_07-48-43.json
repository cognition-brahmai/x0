        "content": "So I've got this equation: 3x - 4y = 12, and I need to find the slope and y-intercept of the line it represents. I know that the slope-intercept form of a line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. So, I need to manipulate this equation to look like that.\n\nFirst, I'll start by isolating the y term. The equation is 3x - 4y = 12. I can subtract 3x from both sides to get:\n\n-4y = -3x + 12\n\nNow, I need to solve for y, so I'll divide every term by -4:\n\ny = (-3x / -4) + (12 / -4)\n\nSimplifying this, I get:\n\ny = (3/4)x - 3\n\nOkay, now it's in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. So, looking at the equation y = (3/4)x - 3, I can see that the slope (m) is 3/4 and the y-intercept (b) is -3.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about what the y-intercept means. It's the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which happens when x = 0. So, plugging x = 0 into the original equation:\n\n3(0) - 4y = 12\n\n-4y = 12\n\ny = -3\n\nYes, that matches the y-intercept I found earlier.\n\nNow, for the slope, I know that it's the change in y divided by the change in x (rise over run). From the equation y = (3/4)x - 3, for every increase of 4 in x, y increases by 3. So, the slope is indeed 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for slope between two points on the line. Let's say I pick two points based on the equation. If x = 0, y = -3, so one point is (0, -3). If x = 4, then y = (3/4)(4) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0, so another point is (4, 0). Now, using the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (0 - (-3))/(4 - 0) = 3/4\n\nThat matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the slope of the line is 3/4 and the y-intercept is -3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe slope is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}}\\) and the y-intercept is \\(\\boxed{-3}\\)."
