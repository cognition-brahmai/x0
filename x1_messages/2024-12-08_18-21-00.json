This sounds like a fun project! Let's break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, I need to understand Prim's algorithm for maze generation. Prim's algorithm is typically used for generating minimum spanning trees in graphs, but it can also be adapted to generate mazes. In the context of mazes, we can think of the grid as a graph where each cell is a node, and the walls between cells are edges. The algorithm will start from a random cell and keep adding neighboring cells to the maze, ensuring that there are no cycles, which would create multiple paths.\n\nSo, to implement Prim's algorithm for maze generation, I'll need to:\n\n1. Represent the maze as a grid of cells.\n\n2. Each cell will have walls on its four sides (north, south, east, west).\n\n3. Start from a random cell and add it to the maze.\n\n4. Add the walls of this cell to a frontier list.\n\n5. While the frontier is not empty:\n\na. Pick a random wall from the frontier.\n\nb. If the cell on the other side of the wall is not yet part of the maze:\n\ni. Remove the wall.\n\nii. Add the opposite cell to the maze.\n\niii. Add the walls of the opposite cell to the frontier.\n\nc. Else, do nothing and remove the wall from the frontier.\n\n6. Repeat until the frontier is empty.\n\nOnce the maze is generated, I need to display it as ASCII art. For this, I can represent walls as '#' characters and open paths as spaces. I'll need to handle the boundaries of the grid appropriately.\n\nAfter displaying the maze, I need to allow the user to navigate through it using keyboard input. This means I'll have to keep track of the player's position and handle input for moving in four directions: up, down, left, right. I need to ensure that the player cannot move through walls and that they stay within the bounds of the maze.\n\nAdditionally, I should probably have some way to indicate the start and end points of the maze, and maybe provide a way for the user to reset the maze or quit the program.\n\nAlright, let's start by planning the structure of the program.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a C++ program that generates random mazes using Prim's algorithm, displays them as ASCII art, and allows user navigation, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Maze Generation using Prim's Algorithm**:\n   - Represent the maze as a grid of cells, each with walls on four sides.\n   - Start from a random cell and add it to the maze.\n   - Add the walls of this cell to a frontier list.\n   - Randomly select a wall from the frontier:\n     - If the adjacent cell is not in the maze, remove the wall, add the cell to the maze, and add its walls to the frontier.\n     - If the adjacent cell is already in the maze, just remove the wall from the frontier.\n   - Repeat until no walls are left in the frontier.\n\n2. **Display the Maze as ASCII Art**:\n   - Use `#` for walls and spaces for paths.\n   - Ensure boundaries are properly handled.\n\n3. **User Navigation**:\n   - Allow the user to move a player through the maze using keyboard inputs (up, down, left, right).\n   - Prevent the player from moving through walls.\n   - Provide options to reset the maze or quit the program.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <conio.h> // For _getch()\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Maze {\nprivate:\n    int width, height;\n    vector<vector<char>> grid;\n    vector<pair<int, int>> frontier;\n\n    void initialize(int w, int h) {\n        width = w;\n        height = h;\n        grid.resize(height, vector<char>(width, '#'));\n        srand(time(0));\n    }\n\n    bool isInside(int x, int y) {\n        return x >= 0 && x < width && y >= 0 && y < height;\n    }\n\n    void addFrontier(int x, int y) {\n        int dx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};\n        int dy[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};\n        for (int i = 0;
