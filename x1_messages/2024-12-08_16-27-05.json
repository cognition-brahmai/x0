The intense light and radiation from the sun can burn the sensitive tissues in your eyes, leading to a condition called solar retinopathy. This can cause temporary or permanent vision loss, and may also lead to other eye problems such as cataracts or macular degeneration. It is always best to avoid looking directly at the sun, especially during solar eclipses when people may be tempted to look without proper protection."
