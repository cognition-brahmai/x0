        "content": "So, you're flipping a coin twice and wanting to know the probability of getting heads both times. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand that each coin flip is an independent event. That means the outcome of the first flip doesn't affect the outcome of the second flip. So, the probability of getting heads on the first flip is separate from the probability of getting heads on the second flip.\n\nNow, for a fair coin, the probability of getting heads on a single flip is 1/2, or 0.5. Since the flips are independent, to find the probability of both events happening (getting heads on the first flip and heads on the second flip), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the probability of getting heads on the first flip is 1/2, and the probability of getting heads on the second flip is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of both events happening is:\n\n1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nOr, in decimal form, 0.25, which is the same as 25%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible outcomes when flipping a coin twice. Each flip has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for two flips, the possible outcomes are:\n\n1. Heads on the first flip and heads on the second flip (H, H)\n\n2. Heads on the first flip and tails on the second flip (H, T)\n\n3. Tails on the first flip and heads on the second flip (T, H)\n\n4. Tails on the first flip and tails on the second flip (T, T)\n\nSo, there are four possible outcomes, and only one of them is getting heads both times (H, H). Therefore, the probability is 1 out of 4, or 1/4, which is 25%.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the probability would be the same for getting tails both times (T, T), or any other specific combination, like heads followed by tails (H, T) or tails followed by heads (T, H). Each of these specific sequences has a probability of 1/4.\n\nBut in this case, since you're specifically asking for heads both times, the answer remains 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
