        "content": "So the farmer has 5 acres of land, and each acre yields an average of 150 bushels of corn. If he sells each bushel for $4, I need to find out his total income from selling all the corn.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many bushels of corn he gets from all 5 acres. Since each acre yields 150 bushels, I can multiply the number of acres by the yield per acre to get the total yield.\n\nTotal yield = number of acres \u00d7 yield per acre\nTotal yield = 5 acres \u00d7 150 bushels/acre\nTotal yield = 750 bushels\n\nNow, he sells each bushel for $4, so to find the total income, I need to multiply the total yield by the price per bushel.\n\nTotal income = total yield \u00d7 price per bushel\nTotal income = 750 bushels \u00d7 $4/bushel\nTotal income = $3000\n\nSo, the farmer's total income from selling all the corn produced on his land would be $3000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]"
