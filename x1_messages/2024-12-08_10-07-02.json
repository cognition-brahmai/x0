        "content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a construction company bidding on a bridge contract. I need to calculate the total cost of materials and labor for the project, and also the average monthly expenditure. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the cost of the materials. The bridge requires 500 tons of steel and 200 cubic yards of concrete. The costs are given as $800 per ton for steel and $120 per cubic yard for concrete.\n\nSo, for the steel:\n\nCost of steel = quantity of steel \u00d7 cost per ton\n\nCost of steel = 500 tons \u00d7 $800/ton = $400,000\n\nNext, for the concrete:\n\nCost of concrete = quantity of concrete \u00d7 cost per cubic yard\n\nCost of concrete = 200 cubic yards \u00d7 $120/cubic yard = $24,000\n\nNow, to get the total cost of materials, I'll add the cost of steel and the cost of concrete:\n\nTotal materials cost = cost of steel + cost of concrete = $400,000 + $24,000 = $424,000\n\nAlright, that's the materials covered. Now, I need to calculate the labor costs. The labor costs are estimated at $25,000 per month, and the project is expected to take 18 months to complete.\n\nSo, total labor cost = monthly labor cost \u00d7 number of months\n\nTotal labor cost = $25,000/month \u00d7 18 months = $450,000\n\nNow, to get the total cost of the project, I need to add the total materials cost and the total labor cost:\n\nTotal project cost = total materials cost + total labor cost = $424,000 + $450,000 = $874,000\n\nAlright, that's the total cost. Now, I need to find the average monthly expenditure. Since the project takes 18 months, I'll divide the total project cost by the number of months.\n\nAverage monthly expenditure = total project cost / number of months\n\nAverage monthly expenditure = $874,000 / 18 months \u2248 $48,555.56 per month\n\nWait, let me double-check that division to make sure I got it right.\n\n$874,000 divided by 18:\n\nFirst, 18 \u00d7 48,000 = 864,000\n\nSubtract that from 874,000: 874,000 - 864,000 = 10,000\n\nNow, 18 \u00d7 555 = 9,990\n\nSubtract that from 10,000: 10,000 - 9,990 = 10\n\nSo, $48,555.56 is pretty close, with a remainder of 10, which we can round to $48,555.56.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as $48,555.56, but since we're dealing with money, it's standard to round to two decimal places.\n\nSo, the average monthly expenditure is approximately $48,555.56.\n\nLet me just verify all the steps again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, materials:\n\n- Steel: 500 tons \u00d7 $800/ton = $400,000\n\n- Concrete: 200 cubic yards \u00d7 $120/cubic yard = $24,000\n\n- Total materials: $400,000 + $24,000 = $424,000\n\nLabor:\n\n- $25,000/month \u00d7 18 months = $450,000\n\nTotal project cost: $424,000 + $450,000 = $874,000\n\nAverage monthly expenditure: $874,000 / 18 \u2248 $48,555.56\n\nEverything seems to check out. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total cost of materials and labor for the project is $\\boxed{874000}$, and the average monthly expenditure is approximately $\\boxed{48555.56}$."
