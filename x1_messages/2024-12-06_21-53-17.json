        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car that travels from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour and comes back to Town A at 40 miles per hour. We need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town A and Town B is \\( d \\) miles. That means the total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\) miles.\n\nNow, for the trip from Town A to Town B at 60 mph, the time taken would be \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours.\n\nFor the return trip from Town B to Town A at 40 mph, the time taken would be \\( \\frac{d}{40} \\) hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the entire trip is \\( \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{40} \\) hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120. So,\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{2d}{120} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{40} = \\frac{3d}{120} \\)\n\nAdding them up: \\( \\frac{2d}{120} + \\frac{3d}{120} = \\frac{5d}{120} = \\frac{d}{24} \\) hours.\n\nNow, the total distance is \\( 2d \\) miles, and the total time is \\( \\frac{d}{24} \\) hours.\n\nAverage speed = \\( \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \\times \\frac{24}{d} = 48 \\) mph.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But I've heard that average speed isn't always just the arithmetic mean of the two speeds. In this case, it's coming out to 48 mph, which is actually the harmonic mean of 60 and 40.\n\nLet me verify this with the formula for the harmonic mean for two speeds:\n\nHarmonic mean = \\( \\frac{2ab}{a + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the two speeds.\n\nPlugging in \\( a = 60 \\) and \\( b = 40 \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{2 \\times 60 \\times 40}{60 + 40} = \\frac{4800}{100} = 48 \\) mph.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the distances were different or if the times spent on each leg were different, but in this case, since it's a round trip with the same distance, this approach should work.\n\nAlternatively, if I had assumed a specific distance, say 120 miles between Town A and Town B, then the total distance would be 240 miles.\n\nTime to Town B: \\( \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\) hours.\n\nTime back to Town A: \\( \\frac{120}{40} = 3 \\) hours.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: \\( \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 48 \\) mph.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, regardless of the assumed distance, the average speed comes out to be 48 mph.\n\nI think this is correct. The common mistake might be to take the arithmetic mean of 60 and 40, which is 50 mph, but that's not applicable here because the time spent traveling at each speed is different.\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
