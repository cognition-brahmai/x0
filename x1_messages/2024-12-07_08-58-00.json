        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour, and then comes back from Town B to Town A at 90 miles per hour. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I know that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town A and Town B is D miles. That means the total distance for the round trip is 2D miles.\n\nNow, for the trip from A to B at 60 mph, the time taken would be D divided by 60 hours. And for the return trip from B to A at 90 mph, the time taken would be D divided by 90 hours.\n\nSo, total time is (D/60) + (D/90).\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180.\n\nSo, D/60 = (3D)/180, and D/90 = (2D)/180.\n\nTherefore, total time is (3D + 2D)/180 = 5D/180 = D/36 hours.\n\nTotal distance is 2D miles.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance divided by total time: 2D divided by (D/36), which simplifies to 2D * (36/D) = 72 mph.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But I've heard that average speed for a round trip isn't just the average of the two speeds. Is there a formula for this?\n\nYes, actually, when the distance is the same but speeds are different, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe formula is: average speed = 2 * (speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nPlugging in the values: 2 * (60 * 90) / (60 + 90) = 2 * 5400 / 150 = 10800 / 150 = 72 mph.\n\nSo, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at it. Suppose the distance between Town A and Town B is, say, 180 miles, which is a common multiple of 60 and 90.\n\nThen, time from A to B: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nTime from B to A: 180 / 90 = 2 hours.\n\nTotal time: 3 + 2 = 5 hours.\n\nTotal distance: 180 * 2 = 360 miles.\n\nAverage speed: 360 / 5 = 72 mph.\n\nAgain, 72 mph.\n\nSo, no matter how I approach it, the average speed comes out to be 72 mph.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
