Let me provide you with accurate information.\n\nAmelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, which she did in 1932. She also set several other flight records, including being the first person to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii, to Oakland, California, in 1935. Additionally, she was instrumental in founding the Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.\n\nEarhart's attempt to fly around the world in 1937 was a notable endeavor, although unfortunately, she disappeared during this journey. Despite the challenges she faced, including crashes, her contributions to aviation and her role as a pioneer for women in the field are widely recognized and celebrated.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand Amelia Earhart's true legacy in aviation."
