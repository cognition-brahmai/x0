        "content": "So the factory can produce either 60 units of Product A or 80 units of Product B in one day. But if they decide to produce both on the same day, they can only produce 50% of their maximum capacity for each product. So, I need to find out how many units of each product they can produce in that case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what their maximum capacity is for each product. For Product A, it's 60 units per day, and for Product B, it's 80 units per day.\n\nNow, if they decide to produce both, they can only produce 50% of their maximum capacity for each. So, for Product A, 50% of 60 units would be:\n\n60 units * 0.5 = 30 units\n\nAnd for Product B, 50% of 80 units would be:\n\n80 units * 0.5 = 40 units\n\nSo, if they produce both products on the same day, they can produce 30 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any other constraint here. The problem says \"if they decide to produce both products on the same day, they can only produce 50% of their maximum capacity for each product.\" So, it seems straightforward: just take 50% of each product's maximum capacity.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a total production capacity constraint that I'm not considering. For example, perhaps the factory has a total number of hours in a day, and producing both products simultaneously affects their individual capacities.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems that the only constraint is that producing both products reduces each product's production to 50% of its maximum capacity.\n\nSo, in that case, the factory can produce 30 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B in a single day if they decide to produce both.\n\nLet me just double-check: if they produce only Product A, it's 60 units, only Product B, it's 80 units. If they produce both, it's 50% of each, so 30 units of A and 40 units of B.\n\nThat seems consistent. I don't think there's any other calculation needed here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ units of Product A and } 40 \\text{ units of Product B}} \\]"
