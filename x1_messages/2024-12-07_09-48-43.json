        "content": "So the store sells two types of items: Type A and Type B. It's said that they sell 60% more Type A items than Type B items every day. And they sell 800 Type B items per day. I need to find out the total number of items sold each day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"60% more Type A items than Type B\" means. If they sell 800 Type B items, then Type A items are 60% more than that.\n\nSo, to find 60% of 800, I can calculate 0.60 times 800.\n\n0.60 * 800 = 480.\n\nSo, Type A items are 800 + 480 = 1280 items per day.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I've learned that \"60% more than\" can be calculated by multiplying the base amount by 1 plus the percentage increase in decimal form.\n\nSo, Type A = Type B * (1 + 60/100) = 800 * 1.60 = 1280.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, to find the total items sold each day, I need to add Type A and Type B items together.\n\nTotal items = Type A + Type B = 1280 + 800 = 2080 items per day.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nWell, another way could be to consider the ratio of Type A to Type B items.\n\nIf Type A is 60% more than Type B, then the ratio of Type A to Type B is 160:100, which simplifies to 8:5.\n\nSo, for every 8 Type A items, there are 5 Type B items.\n\nBut since we know Type B is 800, we can set up a proportion.\n\nIf 5 parts correspond to 800 items, then 1 part corresponds to 800 / 5 = 160 items.\n\nTherefore, Type A is 8 parts: 8 * 160 = 1280 items.\n\nAgain, total items are 1280 + 800 = 2080.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which reinforces that 2080 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of variables.\n\nLet\u2019s say Type B items are B, and Type A items are A.\n\nGiven that A = B + 0.60B = 1.60B.\n\nAnd B = 800.\n\nSo, A = 1.60 * 800 = 1280.\n\nTotal items = A + B = 1280 + 800 = 2080.\n\nNo matter how I look at it, the total is 2080 items per day.\n\nI don't think there's any other angle to this problem.\n\nSo, the store sells 2080 items in total each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2080} \\]"
