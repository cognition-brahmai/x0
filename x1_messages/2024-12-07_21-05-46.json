        "content": "So the factory produces enough widgets to fill 5 crates in one hour, and each crate holds 20 widgets. We need to find out how long it will take to fill 200 crates.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many widgets are in 5 crates. Since each crate holds 20 widgets, 5 crates would hold 5 times 20, which is 100 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, if the factory produces 100 widgets in one hour, and we need to fill 200 crates, we first need to know how many widgets are in 200 crates.\n\nEach crate is 20 widgets, so 200 crates would be 200 times 20, which is 4000 widgets.\n\nSo, the factory needs to produce 4000 widgets in total.\n\nSince the factory produces 100 widgets per hour, to find out how many hours it will take to produce 4000 widgets, we divide 4000 by 100.\n\n4000 divided by 100 is 40.\n\nTherefore, it will take 40 hours for the factory to produce enough widgets to fill 200 crates.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, since the factory fills 5 crates per hour, and we need 200 crates, we can simply divide 200 by 5.\n\n200 divided by 5 is also 40 hours.\n\nSo, both methods give us the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the factory will take 40 hours to produce enough widgets to fill 200 crates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
