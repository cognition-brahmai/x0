        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who wrote the book '1984' and what other books they've written. I think the best way to start is by searching the web for information about the book. I can use the WebCrawler tool for that.\n\nPlan: Use WebCrawler to search for information about the book '1984'.\n\n#Evidence1 = WebCrawler['1984 book author']\n\nOkay, so #Evidence1 should give me some search results about the book '1984' and its author. Probably, the first few results will be about George Orwell, since he's the author. But I should make sure to get accurate information.\n\nNext, I need to extract relevant information from those search results. Maybe I can pick out some URLs from the search results that look promising, like from reputable websites like Wikipedia or the author's official website if there is one.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from #Evidence1.\n\n#Evidence2 = URLPicker[#Evidence1]\n\nNow, with #Evidence2, I have a list of URLs that might have information about the book and its author. I need to pick the most relevant ones to look into. Maybe the first few URLs from a trusted search engine would be good.\n\nLet's say I choose the first URL from #Evidence2, which is likely to be Wikipedia's page about '1984'. I'll use the TextExtractor tool to get the content from that URL.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the first URL in #Evidence2.\n\n#Evidence3 = TextExtractor[First URL from #Evidence2]\n\nWith #Evidence3, I have the text content of the webpage, probably Wikipedia's '1984' page. Now, I need to find out who the author is and what other books they've written. I can use the QuerySolver tool to ask specific questions based on this text.\n\nPlan: Ask who the author of '1984' is, based on #Evidence3.\n\n#Evidence4 = QuerySolver['Who is the author of \"1984\"? Given context: #Evidence3']\n\nAssuming #Evidence4 gives me the author's name, which should be George Orwell, next I need to find out what other books he has written. I can either look for this information on the same page or search for it separately.\n\nPlan: Ask for other books written by the author, based on #Evidence3.\n\n#Evidence5 = QuerySolver['What other books has the author of \"1984\" written? Given context: #Evidence3']\n\nIf #Evidence5 provides a list of other books by George Orwell, that should answer the user's question. However, if the information is not comprehensive enough, I might need to look for another source.\n\nAlternatively, I could search for \"George Orwell book list\" using WebCrawler to get more information.\n\nPlan: Search for other books by George Orwell.\n\n#Evidence6 = WebCrawler['George Orwell book list']\n\nThen, extract URLs from #Evidence6.\n\n#Evidence7 = URLPicker[#Evidence6]\n\nChoose a URL, probably the first one, and extract its text.\n\n#Evidence8 = TextExtractor[First URL from #Evidence7]\n\nFinally, use QuerySolver to get the list of books from #Evidence8.\n\n#Evidence9 = QuerySolver['List the books written by George Orwell. Given context: #Evidence8']\n\nThis should give me a more comprehensive list of books by George Orwell.\n\nPutting it all together, the final answer would be:\n\nFinal Answer: #Evidence4 and #Evidence9\n\nBut to make it more efficient, perhaps I can combine some steps. For example, after finding out that George Orwell is the author from #Evidence4, I can directly search for his other books without relying on the same page.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a biography or an author page that lists all his works. I can look for that.\n\nPlan: Search for George Orwell's author page.\n\n#Evidence10 = WebCrawler['George Orwell author page']\n\nThen, pick URLs from #Evidence10.\n\n#Evidence11 = URLPicker[#Evidence10]\n\nExtract text from the first URL.\n\n#Evidence12 = TextExtractor[First URL from #Evidence11]\n\nAsk for the list of books he has written.\n\n#Evidence13 = QuerySolver['List the books written by George Orwell. Given context: #Evidence12']\n\nThis might be a more direct way to get the information.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a single search for \"George Orwell book list\" and proceed from there.\n\nPlan: Search for George Orwell's book list.\n\n#Evidence6 = WebCrawler['George Orwell book list']\n\nPick URLs from #Evidence6.\n\n#Evidence7 = URLPicker[#Evidence6]\n\nExtract text from the first URL.\n\n#Evidence8 = TextExtractor[First URL from #Evidence7]\n\nAsk for the list of books.\n\n#Evidence9 = QuerySolver['List the books written by George Orwell. Given context: #Evidence8']\n\nThis seems straightforward. So, combining the author's name from #Evidence4 and the list of books from #Evidence9 should give me the complete answer.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Use WebCrawler to find information about the book '1984'.\n\n2. Pick URLs from the search results.\n\n3. Extract text from the first URL.\n\n4. Determine the author's name using QuerySolver.\n\n5. Search for the author's book list.\n\n6. Pick URLs from the search results.\n\n7. Extract text from the first URL.\n\n8. List the books written by the author using QuerySolver.\n\nFinal Answer: The author of '1984' is [name from #Evidence4], and other books written by them are [list from #Evidence9]."
