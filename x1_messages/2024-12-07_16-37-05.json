        "content": "To calculate the required monthly spending to stay within the $1 billion budget over a three-year construction period, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Budget:** $1,000,000,000\n\n2. **Project Timeline:** 3 years\n\n3. **Convert years to months:** 3 years \u00d7 12 months/year = 36 months\n\n4. **Monthly Spending:** Total Budget \u00f7 Number of Months\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Spending} = \\frac{\\$1,000,000,000}{36} \\approx \\$27,777,778 \\text{ per month}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the required monthly spending to stay within budget and complete the project on time is approximately $27,777,778.\n\nNext, estimating the annual maintenance costs for the stadium involves considering several factors such as utilities, staffing, and repairs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how we might approach this estimation:\n\n1. **Utilities:**\n   - Electricity: Stadiums require significant energy for lighting, cooling/heating, and various electronic systems.\n   - Water: For landscaping, restrooms, and other facilities.\n   - Estimate: Depending on the size and technology used, utilities could range from $1 to $5 per square foot annually. Assuming an average of $3 per square foot and a stadium size of, say, 1,000,000 square feet:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Utilities} = 1,000,000 \\text{ sq ft} \\times \\$3/\\text{sq ft} = \\$3,000,000 \\text{ per year}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Staffing:**\n   - Stadium requires staff for operations, security, maintenance, customer service, etc.\n   - Estimate: Assuming an average of 200 staff members with an average annual salary of $50,000:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Staffing} = 200 \\times \\$50,000 = \\$10,000,000 \\text{ per year}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Repairs and Maintenance:**\n   - Regular upkeep to maintain the stadium's condition, including minor repairs, replacements, and upgrades.\n   - Estimate: Typically, this could be around 1-3% of the construction cost per year. Assuming 2%:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Repairs and Maintenance} = 0.02 \\times \\$1,000,000,000 = \\$20,000,000 \\text{ per year}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Insurance:**\n   - Liability insurance, property insurance, etc.\n   - Estimate: Around 0.5-1% of the construction cost per year. Assuming 0.75%:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Insurance} = 0.0075 \\times \\$1,000,000,000 = \\$7,500,000 \\text{ per year}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Marketing and Promotions:**\n   - To attract events and spectators.\n   - Estimate: Variable, but assuming $1,000,000 per year.\n\n6. **Administrative Costs:**\n   - Overhead costs, management salaries, etc.\n   - Estimate: Around $2,000,000 per year.\n\nAdding all these components together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Annual Maintenance Costs} = \\$3,000,000 + \\$10,000,000 + \\$20,000,000 + \\$7,500,000 + \\$1,000,000 + \\$2,000,000 = \\$43,500,000 \\text{ per year}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the estimated annual maintenance costs for the stadium would be approximately $43,500,000.\n\n**Note:** These estimates are rough and can vary significantly based on specific details such as the stadium's location, technology used, local labor costs, and more. It's always advisable to conduct a detailed analysis for precise figures."
