        "content": "Let's tackle this marble problem step by step. So, we have a bag with red, blue, and green marbles. The ratios given are:\n\n- The ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:2.\n\n- The ratio of blue to green marbles is 4:5.\n\nAnd the total number of marbles is 90. We need to find out how many marbles there are of each color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how these ratios relate to each other. Since we have two separate ratios involving blue marbles, maybe I can combine them to find a single ratio that includes all three colors.\n\nThe ratio of red to blue is 3:2, and the ratio of blue to green is 4:5. To combine these, I need to make the number of blue marbles in both ratios the same. That way, I can link them directly.\n\nLet's look at the blue marbles in both ratios. In the first ratio, blue is 2 parts, and in the second, it's 4 parts. The least common multiple of 2 and 4 is 4. So, I'll adjust the first ratio so that blue is 4 parts.\n\nTo do that, I'll multiply both parts of the first ratio by 2:\n\nRed:Blue = 3:2 becomes (3*2):(2*2) = 6:4.\n\nNow, the first ratio is Red:Blue = 6:4, and the second ratio is Blue:Green = 4:5.\n\nSince both ratios have blue as 4 parts, I can combine them into a single ratio:\n\nRed:Blue:Green = 6:4:5.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let's check. Red to Blue is 6:4, and Blue to Green is 4:5. So, yes, the combined ratio is Red:Blue:Green = 6:4:5.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of red marbles as 6x, blue marbles as 4x, and green marbles as 5x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nThe total number of marbles is 90, so:\n\n6x + 4x + 5x = 90\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n15x = 90\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 90 / 15\n\nx = 6\n\nNow, plug x back into the expressions for each color:\n\nRed marbles: 6x = 6*6 = 36\n\nBlue marbles: 4x = 4*6 = 24\n\nGreen marbles: 5x = 5*6 = 30\n\nLet me double-check if these numbers satisfy the original ratios.\n\nFirst, red to blue ratio should be 3:2.\n\n36 red marbles to 24 blue marbles simplifies to 3:2, since 36/12 = 3 and 24/12 = 2. So, that checks out.\n\nNext, blue to green ratio should be 4:5.\n\n24 blue marbles to 30 green marbles simplifies to 4:5, since 24/6 = 4 and 30/6 = 5. Perfect.\n\nAnd the total is 36 + 24 + 30 = 90, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, the number of marbles of each color is:\n\nRed: 36\n\nBlue: 24\n\nGreen: 30\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36 \\text{ red}, 24 \\text{ blue}, 30 \\text{ green}} \\]"
