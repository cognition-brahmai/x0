        "content": "Let's see. So, the train is going at 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours to reach its destination. First, I need to find out what the destination is, I mean, how far away it is.\n\nSo, distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance is 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nNow, the question is, how long would it take for the train to travel twice the distance at half the speed?\n\nTwice the distance would be 2 times 120 miles, which is 240 miles.\n\nHalf the speed would be half of 60 miles per hour, which is 30 miles per hour.\n\nSo, now I need to find out how long it takes to travel 240 miles at 30 miles per hour.\n\nTime equals distance divided by speed, right?\n\nSo, time is 240 miles divided by 30 miles per hour.\n\nThat would be 8 hours.\n\nSo, it would take 8 hours.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nOriginal speed: 60 mph\n\nOriginal time: 2 hours\n\nOriginal distance: 60 * 2 = 120 miles\n\nTwice the distance: 240 miles\n\nHalf the speed: 30 mph\n\nTime = distance / speed = 240 / 30 = 8 hours.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf the distance is doubled and the speed is halved, the time should increase by a factor of four.\n\nBecause time is directly proportional to distance and inversely proportional to speed.\n\nSo, (2)(distance) / (0.5)(speed) = 4 times the original time.\n\nOriginal time was 2 hours, so 4 times 2 is 8 hours.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 8 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
