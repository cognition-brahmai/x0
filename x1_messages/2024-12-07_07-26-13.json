        "content": "So at this party, everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, and there were 66 handshakes in total. I need to figure out how many guests were there. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving combinations, where the order doesn't matter, right? Because shaking hands is a mutual thing; if person A shakes hands with person B, it's the same as person B shaking hands with person A.\n\nSo, if there are n guests at the party, each guest shakes hands with n-1 other guests. But since each handshake is counted twice in this way (once for each participant), the total number of unique handshakes is n(n-1)/2. That formula is for combinations, specifically C(n, 2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n to shake hands.\n\nGiven that, I can set up the equation:\n\nn(n-1)/2 = 66\n\nNow, I need to solve for n.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\nn(n-1) = 132\n\nSo, n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation. I can solve for n using the quadratic formula:\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 528)] / 2\n\nWait, let's compute the discriminant:\n\n1 + 528 = 529\n\nAnd \u221a529 = 23\n\nSo, n = [1 \u00b1 23]/2\n\nThat gives me two potential solutions:\n\nn = (1 + 23)/2 = 24/2 = 12\n\nn = (1 - 23)/2 = -22/2 = -11\n\nBut n has to be a positive integer since it represents the number of guests, so n = 12.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIf there are 12 guests, the number of handshakes is C(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66, which matches the given total.\n\nSo, there were 12 guests at the party.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
