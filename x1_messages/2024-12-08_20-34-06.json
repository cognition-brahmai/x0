        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have two factories: Factory A and Factory B, both producing widgets. Factory A cranks out 60% of the total widgets, and Factory B handles the remaining 40%. Now, Factory A has a defect rate of 4%, meaning 4% of the widgets it produces are defective. Factory B has a higher defect rate of 8%.\n\nThe question is: If you pick a widget at random from the combined output of both factories, what's the probability that it's defective?\n\nAlright, to solve this, I think I need to use the law of total probability. That's because the widgets come from two different sources with different defect rates. So, I'll consider the probability of selecting a defective widget from each factory and then weight it by the proportion each factory contributes to the total production.\n\nFirst, let's define the events:\n\n- Let A be the event that a widget is produced by Factory A.\n\n- Let B be the event that a widget is produced by Factory B.\n\n- Let D be the event that a widget is defective.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- P(A) = 60% or 0.60\n\n- P(B) = 40% or 0.40\n\n- P(D|A) = 4% or 0.04 (probability that a widget is defective given that it's from Factory A)\n\n- P(D|B) = 8% or 0.08 (probability that a widget is defective given that it's from Factory B)\n\nWe need to find P(D), the total probability that a randomly selected widget is defective.\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\nP(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(D) = (0.04 * 0.60) + (0.08 * 0.40)\n\nNow, let's calculate each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.04 * 0.60 = 0.024\n\nSecond term: 0.08 * 0.40 = 0.032\n\nAdding them up:\n\nP(D) = 0.024 + 0.032 = 0.056\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected widget is defective is 0.056, or 5.6%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. Factory A produces more widgets but has a lower defect rate, while Factory B produces fewer widgets but has a higher defect rate. So, the overall defect rate should be between 4% and 8%, weighted by their production amounts.\n\nLet me verify the calculation:\n\n0.04 * 0.60 = 0.024\n\n0.08 * 0.40 = 0.032\n\nYes, adding them gives 0.056, which is 5.6%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of actual numbers. Suppose the company produces 1000 widgets in total.\n\n- Factory A produces 600 widgets (60% of 1000).\n\n- Factory B produces 400 widgets (40% of 1000).\n\nNow, defects from Factory A: 4% of 600 = 24 widgets.\n\nDefects from Factory B: 8% of 400 = 32 widgets.\n\nTotal defective widgets: 24 + 32 = 56.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a defective widget is 56 out of 1000, which is 0.056 or 5.6%. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected widget is defective is 5.6%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.056} \\]"
