Below is a simple C# program that simulates a bank account with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace BankAccountSimulation\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            BankAccount account = new BankAccount(\"12345\", 1000.0);\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Initial Balance: \" + account.GetBalance());\n\n            account.Deposit(500.0);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Balance after deposit: \" + account.GetBalance());\n\n            bool withdrawalSuccessful = account.Withdraw(200.0);\n            if (withdrawalSuccessful)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: \" + account.GetBalance());\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal failed. Insufficient funds.\");\n            }\n\n            // Trying to withdraw more than the balance\n            withdrawalSuccessful = account.Withdraw(2000.0);\n            if (withdrawalSuccessful)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: \" + account.GetBalance());\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Withdrawal failed. Insufficient funds.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    class BankAccount\n    {\n        private string accountNumber;\n        private double balance;\n\n        public BankAccount(string accountNumber, double initialBalance)\n        {\n            this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n            this.balance = initialBalance;\n        }\n\n        public void Deposit(double amount)\n        {\n            if (amount > 0)\n            {\n                balance += amount;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        public bool Withdraw(double amount)\n        {\n            if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance)\n            {\n                balance -= amount;\n                return true;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid withdrawal amount or insufficient funds.\");\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        public double GetBalance()\n        {\n            return balance;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **BankAccount Class**:\n   - **Properties**:\n     - `accountNumber`: A string representing the account number.\n     - `balance`: A double representing the current balance.\n   - **Constructors**:\n     - Initializes the account with an account number and an initial balance.\n   - **Methods**:\n     - `Deposit(double amount)`: Adds the specified amount to the balance if the amount is positive.\n     - `Withdraw(double amount)`: Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if the amount is positive and sufficient funds are available.\n     - `GetBalance()`: Returns the current balance.\n\n2. **Program Class**:\n   - **Main Method**:\n     - Creates a new `BankAccount` object with an account number and initial balance.\n     - Demonstrates depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n     - Includes scenarios where withdrawal is successful and unsuccessful due to insufficient funds.\n\nThis program provides a basic simulation of bank account operations and can be expanded with additional features like interest calculation, transaction history, etc."
