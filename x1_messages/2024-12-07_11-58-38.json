It seems like the answer is something that can be observed in both water and the sky, and is also associated with specific things like a rainbow, a jay's feather, and lapis lazuli.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"seen in the water\" could mean a few things. It might refer to something that is present in water, like a color or a substance. Maybe it's a color that appears in water, like blue, since water is often blue. Or perhaps it's something that reflects on water.\n\nThen, it says \"if seen in the sky, I am in the rainbow.\" Rainbows are made up of multiple colors, but specifically, the color blue is one of them. Similarly, a jay's feather is often blue, and lapis lazuli is a blue semi-precious stone. So, all these references point towards the color blue.\n\nLet me think about this. Is the answer simply the color blue? It makes sense because blue is visible in water, in the sky, in rainbows, in jay's feathers, and in lapis lazuli. But maybe there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's not just the color blue, but a specific wavelength of light or a concept related to color. But that seems more complicated than necessary. The straightforward answer seems to be blue.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's something that affects the perception of color, like sunlight or reflection. But that doesn't quite fit with the references to specific objects like a jay's feather and lapis lazuli.\n\nLet me consider the properties of blue. Blue is a primary color in the RGB color model and is associated with cool temperatures. In nature, blue is less common in flowers but more common in skies and water bodies due to the scattering of light.\n\nIn rainbows, blue is one of the seven colors typically seen, although the number can vary based on lighting conditions. Jays, particularly blue jays, have vibrant blue feathers, and lapis lazuli is a deep blue stone that has been valued for its color for centuries.\n\nSo, if I were to sum it up, the common thread here is the color blue, which appears in all the mentioned contexts: water, sky, rainbow, jay's feather, and lapis lazuli.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the riddle is blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{blue}} \\]"
