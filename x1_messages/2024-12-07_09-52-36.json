        "content": "Certainly! To solve this problem, we need to find the longest substring in a given string that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nOne efficient way to find the longest palindromic substring is to expand around each character (or pair of characters for even-length palindromes) and keep track of the longest palindrome found during these expansions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - We'll keep track of the starting index and the maximum length of the palindrome found.\n   \n2. **Expansion around Center**:\n   - For each character in the string, consider it as the center of a potential palindrome and expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides match.\n   - This needs to be done for both odd-length and even-length palindromes.\n\n3. **Update Maximum Palindrome**:\n   - Whenever a longer palindrome is found during expansion, update the starting index and the maximum length.\n\n4. **Return the Longest Palindrome**:\n   - After checking all possible centers, extract and return the substring using the starting index and maximum length.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindrome(s):\n    if not s or len(s) < 1:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    start = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Odd length palindrome\n        len1 = expand_around_center(s, i, i)\n        # Even length palindrome\n        len2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)\n        # Find the maximum length\n        max_len = max(len1, len2)\n        if max_len > max_length:\n            max_length = max_len\n            start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2\n    \n    return s[start:start + max_length]\n\ndef expand_around_center(s, left, right):\n    L = left\n    R = right\n    while L >= 0 and R < len(s) and s[L] == s[R]:\n        L -= 1\n        R += 1\n    return R - L - 1\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"babad\"\nprint(longest_palindrome(input_string))  # Output: \"bab\" or \"aba\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We handle edge cases where the string is empty or has less than one character.\n   - We initialize `start` to keep track of the starting index of the longest palindrome and `max_length` to keep track of its length.\n\n2. **Expansion around Center**:\n   - For each character, we expand around it for both odd-length and even-length palindromes.\n   - The `expand_around_center` function takes a left and right index and expands outwards as long as characters at these indices are equal.\n\n3. **Update Maximum Palindrome**:\n   - We compare the lengths of palindromes found during expansions and update `start` and `max_length` if a longer palindrome is found.\n\n4. **Return the Longest Palindrome**:\n   - Using the `start` index and `max_length`, we extract and return the substring which is the longest palindromic substring.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest palindromic substring with a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the input string."
