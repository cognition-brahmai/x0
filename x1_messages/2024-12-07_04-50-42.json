        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to write a Java program that reads a text file containing lines of space-separated integers, identifies the even numbers among them, calculates their sum, and finally prints the result to the console.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading the File**: We will use Java's `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line.\n2. **Parsing Integers**: For each line, we will split the line into strings based on spaces and then parse these strings into integers.\n3. **Checking for Even Numbers**: We will check each integer to see if it is even (i.e., divisible by 2).\n4. **Summing Even Numbers**: We will keep a running total of the sum of all even numbers.\n5. **Handling Exceptions**: We will handle any file not found or IO exceptions that may occur during file operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class SumEvenNumbers {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String filePath = \"numbers.txt\"; // Specify the path to your text file\n        int sum = 0;\n\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                String[] parts = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n                for (String part : parts) {\n                    try {\n                        int number = Integer.parseInt(part);\n                        if (number % 2 == 0) {\n                            sum += number;\n                        }\n                    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n                        // Handle invalid integer strings\n                        System.err.println(\"Invalid integer: \" + part);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Sum of even numbers: \" + sum);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **File Reading**: We use `BufferedReader` to read the file specified by `filePath`. The `try-with-resources` statement ensures that the `BufferedReader` is closed automatically after reading.\n2. **Line Processing**: For each line read from the file, we split it into parts based on spaces using `split(\"\\\\s+\")`. This handles multiple spaces between numbers.\n3. **Integer Parsing and Summation**: Each part is parsed to an integer. If successful, we check if the number is even using `number % 2 == 0`. If it is even, we add it to the sum.\n4. **Exception Handling**: We handle `NumberFormatException` to manage any strings that cannot be parsed to integers and `IOException` for file reading errors.\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the sum of all even numbers to the console.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program is robust, handles different edge cases, and provides clear output."
