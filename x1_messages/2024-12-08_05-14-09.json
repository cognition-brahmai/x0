        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total.\n\nFirst, I think about person A. Person A shakes hands with person B, person C, and person D. So that's 3 handshakes for person A.\n\nNext, person B has already shaken hands with person A, so person B only needs to shake hands with person C and person D. That's 2 additional handshakes.\n\nThen, person C has already shaken hands with person A and person B, so person C only needs to shake hands with person D. That's 1 additional handshake.\n\nFinally, person D has already shaken hands with person A, person B, and person C, so person D doesn't need to shake hands with anyone else.\n\nSo, total handshakes are 3 (from A) + 2 (from B) + 1 (from C) + 0 (from D) = 6 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the number of handshakes in a group of n people, where each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n = 4, so C(4, 2) = 4*3/2 = 12/2 = 6 handshakes.\n\nWait, both methods give me the same answer, which is 6 handshakes. I think that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me list out all possible handshakes:\n\n1. A shakes hands with B\n\n2. A shakes hands with C\n\n3. A shakes hands with D\n\n4. B shakes hands with C\n\n5. B shakes hands with D\n\n6. C shakes hands with D\n\nYes, that's 6 handshakes in total.\n\nI remember that this is a classic problem in combinatorics, and the formula n(n-1)/2 is used to calculate the number of unique pairs that can be formed from n items. In this case, the items are people, and the pairs are handshakes.\n\nSo, for 4 people, it's 4*3/2 = 6.\n\nIf I had more people, say 5, it would be 5*4/2 = 10 handshakes.\n\nOr for 10 people, it would be 10*9/2 = 45 handshakes.\n\nYeah, I think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
