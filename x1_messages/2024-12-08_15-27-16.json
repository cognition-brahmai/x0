        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have boxes of cupcakes in two sizes: 6 and 8. The customer wants exactly 50 cupcakes. We need to figure out how many boxes of each size to buy to make up exactly 50 cupcakes.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of 6-cupcake boxes as x and the number of 8-cupcake boxes as y. So, the total number of cupcakes can be represented by the equation:\n\n6x + 8y = 50\n\nOur goal is to find non-negative integer values for x and y that satisfy this equation.\n\nSince 6 and 8 are both even numbers, and 50 is also even, there should be integer solutions to this equation.\n\nLet's try to solve for one variable in terms of the other. I'll solve for x:\n\n6x = 50 - 8y\n\nx = (50 - 8y)/6\n\nNow, x must be an integer, so (50 - 8y) must be divisible by 6.\n\nLet's find values of y that make (50 - 8y) divisible by 6.\n\nWe can test integer values of y starting from 0 upwards.\n\nLet's try y = 0:\n\n(50 - 8*0)/6 = 50/6 \u2248 8.333 (not an integer)\n\ny = 1:\n\n(50 - 8*1)/6 = (50 - 8)/6 = 42/6 = 7 (integer)\n\nSo, y = 1 and x = 7 is a possible solution.\n\nLet's check if this works:\n\n6*7 + 8*1 = 42 + 8 = 50\n\nPerfect, it adds up to 50.\n\nLet's see if there are other solutions.\n\ny = 2:\n\n(50 - 16)/6 = 34/6 \u2248 5.666 (not integer)\n\ny = 3:\n\n(50 - 24)/6 = 26/6 \u2248 4.333 (not integer)\n\ny = 4:\n\n(50 - 32)/6 = 18/6 = 3 (integer)\n\nSo, y = 4 and x = 3 is another solution.\n\nCheck:\n\n6*3 + 8*4 = 18 + 32 = 50\n\nGood.\n\ny = 5:\n\n(50 - 40)/6 = 10/6 \u2248 1.666 (not integer)\n\ny = 6:\n\n(50 - 48)/6 = 2/6 \u2248 0.333 (not integer)\n\ny = 7:\n\n(50 - 56)/6 = (-6)/6 = -1 (negative, not acceptable)\n\nSo, y cannot be greater than 4.\n\nSimilarly, y cannot be less than 0.\n\nTherefore, the possible solutions are:\n\n1. y = 1, x = 7\n\n2. y = 4, x = 3\n\nSo, the customer can either buy 7 boxes of 6 cupcakes and 1 box of 8 cupcakes, or 3 boxes of 6 cupcakes and 4 boxes of 8 cupcakes.\n\nLet's see which one makes more sense in terms of the number of boxes.\n\nThe first option is 7 + 1 = 8 boxes, and the second is 3 + 4 = 7 boxes.\n\nIf there's a preference for fewer boxes, the second option is better.\n\nBut unless specified, both are valid solutions.\n\nAlternatively, if there are constraints on the number of boxes, one might be more preferable than the other.\n\nBut based on the information given, both are correct.\n\nSo, the customer has two options:\n\nOption 1: 7 boxes of 6 and 1 box of 8.\n\nOption 2: 3 boxes of 6 and 4 boxes of 8.\n\nI think that's all for this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(x, y) = (7, 1) \\text{ or } (3, 4)} \\]"
