        "content": "Let's see. If someone saves 5% of their monthly income every month, and their monthly income is $3,000, I need to find out how much they'll have saved after a year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much they save each month. Since it's 5% of $3,000, I can calculate that by multiplying 3,000 by 5% or 0.05.\n\nSo, monthly savings = $3,000 * 0.05 = $150.\n\nNow, there are 12 months in a year, so to find the total savings for the year, I can multiply the monthly savings by 12.\n\nTotal savings = $150 * 12 = $1,800.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider if there's any interest earned on the savings or something like that. But the question doesn't mention any interest, so probably it's just simple accumulation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are some deductions or expenses that could affect the savings, but again, the question doesn't specify any of that. It says they save 5% every month, so I think $1,800 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. If they save $150 each month for 12 months, that should indeed be $1,800.\n\nYes, I think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1800} \\]"
