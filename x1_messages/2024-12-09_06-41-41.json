        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and out of those, 1% don't pass the quality check and get thrown away. I need to find out how many widgets are sent out successfully each day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets fail the quality test. If 1% fail, then I can calculate that by taking 1% of 1000.\n\nSo, 1% of 1000 is:\n\n(1/100) * 1000 = 10 widgets\n\nThat means 10 widgets are discarded each day.\n\nNow, to find out how many are shipped out successfully, I need to subtract the failed widgets from the total produced.\n\nSo, 1000 - 10 = 990 widgets\n\nTherefore, 990 widgets are successfully shipped out each day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of finding the failed ones and subtracting, I can directly calculate the number of successful ones.\n\nSince 1% fail, that means 99% pass the test, right?\n\nSo, 99% of 1000 is:\n\n(99/100) * 1000 = 990 widgets\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check if there's any other factor to consider. Is there any possibility that the failed widgets are repaired and shipped out later? The question doesn't mention that, so I think it's safe to assume that the discarded widgets aren't shipped out.\n\nAlso, it says \"each widget is tested for quality before being shipped out,\" so all widgets go through the test, and only the ones that pass are shipped.\n\nSo, no need to worry about any widgets not being tested or anything like that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 990 widgets shipped out successfully each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{990} \\]"
