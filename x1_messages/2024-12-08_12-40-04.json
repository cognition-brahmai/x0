        "content": "Alright, let's solve this equation step by step. The equation is:\n\n4(2x - 3) + 7 = 15\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the left side of the equation. I see that there's a 4 multiplied by (2x - 3), so I'll use the distributive property to multiply 4 by both 2x and -3.\n\n4 * 2x = 8x\n\n4 * (-3) = -12\n\nSo, 4(2x - 3) becomes 8x - 12.\n\nNow, the equation looks like this:\n\n8x - 12 + 7 = 15\n\nNext, I'll combine the like terms on the left side. -12 and +7 are constants, so:\n\n-12 + 7 = -5\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n8x - 5 = 15\n\nI need to isolate the term with x, which is 8x. To do that, I'll add 5 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -5 on the left side.\n\n8x - 5 + 5 = 15 + 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n8x = 20\n\nNow, to solve for x, I'll divide both sides by 8.\n\n8x / 8 = 20 / 8\n\nx = 20/8\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4.\n\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\n8 \u00f7 4 = 2\n\nSo, x = 5/2\n\nTo make sure this is correct, I'll plug x = 5/2 back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n4(2x - 3) + 7 = 15\n\nSubstitute x = 5/2:\n\n4(2*(5/2) - 3) + 7 = ?\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n2*(5/2) = 5\n\nSo, 5 - 3 = 2\n\nNow, multiply by 4:\n\n4*2 = 8\n\nThen add 7:\n\n8 + 7 = 15\n\nYes, the left side equals the right side, so x = 5/2 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{2}} \\]"
