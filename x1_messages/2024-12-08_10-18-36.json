        "content": "In the velvet expanse of night's embrace,\nStars whisper tales of ancient grace.\nEach a beacon, burning bright,\nIn the silent, endless night.\n\nThey twinkle like promises made,\nTo those who dare to believe in fate.\nTheir light, a gentle cascade,\nGuiding souls, a sacred aid.\n\nOh, stars above, you are the ink,\nThat writes the poem of the sky's blank.\nWith your silver threads, you weave a cloak,\nOver the world, both old and new, a\u043e\u043a\u043e.\n\nIn your depths, I find solace,\nA mirror to my own soul's morass.\nYou stand as timeless sentinels,\nWitnessing the ebb and flow of life's cycles.\n\nYour beauty is a balm to the weary heart,\nA reminder that we are but small parts,\nIn the grand tapestry of the universe's art.\nYet, in your light, we find our worth.\n\nSo here's to the stars, so high and free,\nTo their mysteries, both near and far.\nMay we always look up to thee,\nAnd dream of what lies beyond, my dear."
