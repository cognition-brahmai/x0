        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A every day, and each unit requires 4 screws and 2 bolts. So, per day, the factory uses:\n\nScrews: 500 units * 4 screws/unit = 2000 screws\n\nBolts: 500 units * 2 bolts/unit = 1000 bolts\n\nNow, the factory has 20,000 screws and 15,000 bolts in stock.\n\nTo find out how many days the factory can continue production before running out of screws, we divide the total screws by the daily usage:\n\n20,000 screws / 2000 screws/day = 10 days\n\nSimilarly, for bolts:\n\n15,000 bolts / 1000 bolts/day = 15 days\n\nSo, the factory can continue production for 10 days based on screws and 15 days based on bolts. Therefore, the limiting factor is the screws, and the factory will run out of screws after 10 days.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure.\n\nIf the factory operates for 10 days:\n\nScrews used: 10 days * 2000 screws/day = 20,000 screws\n\nBolts used: 10 days * 1000 bolts/day = 10,000 bolts\n\nAfter 10 days, the factory would have used up all its screws, but still have 15,000 - 10,000 = 5,000 bolts left.\n\nSo, indeed, the factory will run out of screws before it runs out of bolts.\n\nTherefore, the factory can continue production for 10 days before running out of screws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
