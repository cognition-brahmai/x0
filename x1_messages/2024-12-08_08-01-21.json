        "content": "So, you've got a rectangular garden that's 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. You're wondering how many meters you'd walk if you went all the way around the perimeter. Let's figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is. The perimeter is the total distance around the edge of the shape. For a rectangle, there are two pairs of equal sides: the lengths and the widths.\n\nIn this case, the length is 30 meters, and the width is 20 meters. So, there are two sides that are 30 meters each and two sides that are 20 meters each.\n\nTo find the total perimeter, we can add up all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = length + length + width + width\n\nThat is:\n\nPerimeter = 30 meters + 30 meters + 20 meters + 20 meters\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\n30 + 30 = 60 meters\n\n20 + 20 = 40 meters\n\n60 + 40 = 100 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter of the garden is 100 meters.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle that might be easier to remember:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nUsing the given dimensions:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (30 meters + 20 meters)\n\nFirst, add the length and width:\n\n30 + 20 = 50 meters\n\nThen, multiply by 2:\n\n2 \u00d7 50 = 100 meters\n\nAgain, we get 100 meters.\n\nSo, if you walk around the entire perimeter of the garden, you would have walked 100 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
