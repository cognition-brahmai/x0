        "content": "Let's see. The problem says that a store sells three types of candies: A, B, and C. The ratio of the number of candies sold is 3:4:5, and the total number of candies sold is 120. I need to find out how many of each type are sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio like 3:4:5 tells me that for every 3 candies of type A, there are 4 of type B and 5 of type C. So, the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 parts.\n\nNow, if the total number of candies is 120, that means these 12 parts together make up 120 candies. So, to find out how many candies each part represents, I can divide the total number of candies by the total number of parts.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n120 candies \u00f7 12 parts = 10 candies per part.\n\nNow that I know each part is equal to 10 candies, I can find out the number of candies of each type by multiplying the number of parts for each type by 10.\n\nFor type A: 3 parts \u00d7 10 = 30 candies.\n\nFor type B: 4 parts \u00d7 10 = 40 candies.\n\nFor type C: 5 parts \u00d7 10 = 50 candies.\n\nLet me check if these add up to the total:\n\n30 + 40 + 50 = 120 candies. Yes, that matches the total given.\n\nSo, the store sold 30 candies of type A, 40 of type B, and 50 of type C.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions or equations.\n\nLet\u2019s try that. Let\u2019s denote the number of candies of types A, B, and C as 3x, 4x, and 5x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of these is 120:\n\n3x + 4x + 5x = 120\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n12x = 120\n\nNow, solving for x:\n\nx = 120 \u00f7 12\n\nx = 10\n\nNow, plugging back to find each type:\n\nA: 3x = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n\nB: 4x = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n\nC: 5x = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\nSame results as before. Good, it confirms my earlier answer.\n\nIs there any other method I can use to verify this?\n\nPerhaps using percentages.\n\nTotal ratio parts are 12.\n\nSo, the percentage for each type would be:\n\nA: (3/12) \u00d7 100% = 25%\n\nB: (4/12) \u00d7 100% = 33.33%\n\nC: (5/12) \u00d7 100% = 41.67%\n\nNow, applying these percentages to the total number of candies:\n\nA: 25% of 120 = 0.25 \u00d7 120 = 30\n\nB: 33.33% of 120 = approximately 0.3333 \u00d7 120 = 40\n\nC: 41.67% of 120 = approximately 0.4167 \u00d7 120 = 50\n\nAgain, the same results. This gives me more confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this problem could be interpreted.\n\nThe ratio is clearly given as 3:4:5, so I don't think there's room for misinterpretation. The total is straightforward at 120 candies.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the ratio as fractions of the total.\n\nSo, type A is 3/12 of the total, type B is 4/12, and type C is 5/12.\n\nSimplifying the fractions:\n\nA: 3/12 = 1/4\n\nB: 4/12 = 1/3\n\nC: 5/12 remains as is.\n\nNow, calculating each:\n\nA: 1/4 of 120 = 30\n\nB: 1/3 of 120 = 40\n\nC: 5/12 of 120 = 50\n\nOnce again, the same numbers.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently using multiple methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the ratio was by weight or something else, but the problem specifies the ratio of the number of candies sold, so it's clear.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the total adds up:\n\n30 + 40 + 50 = 120\n\nYes, it does.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the store sold 30 candies of type A, 40 of type B, and 50 of type C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ candies of type A}, 40 \\text{ candies of type B}, 50 \\text{ candies of type C}} \\]"
