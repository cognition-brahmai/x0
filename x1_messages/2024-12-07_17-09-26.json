        "content": "So, there's this car park with 4 levels, and each level can hold 15 cars. If it's full, how many cars are parked there? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"full\" means. I think it means that all the available spots in the car park are occupied by cars. So, if each level can accommodate 15 cars, and there are 4 levels, then the total number of cars when it's full should be the number of levels multiplied by the number of cars per level.\n\nSo, that would be 4 levels times 15 cars per level. Let me do the math: 4 times 15 is 60. So, if the car park is full, there should be 60 cars parked there.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. Maybe there are some other factors to consider, like reserved spots or anything like that. But the question doesn't mention anything about reserved spots, so I think it's safe to assume that all spots are available for parking.\n\nAlso, it's possible that some levels have more or less capacity, but again, the question says each level can accommodate 15 cars, so they all seem to have the same capacity.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any spaces reserved for motorcycles or bicycles, but again, the question doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that all spaces are for cars.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if the car park has 4 levels, each with 15 car spaces, and it's full, then the total number of cars parked there should be 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
