        "content": "In the Harry Potter series, the magical sport played on broomsticks that involves scoring points with a Quaffle and catching the Golden Snitch is called Quidditch. It's a popular game in the wizarding world, and it's often compared to football or basketball in terms of its popularity and excitement. The game is played between two teams, each consisting of seven players: three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker. The Chasers handle the Quaffle, which is a round ball that they throw through any of the three hoops on the opponent's side to score points. The Beaters use bats to hit Bludgers, which are dangerous balls that try to knock players off their broomsticks. The Keeper guards the team's hoops to prevent the opposing team from scoring, and the Seeker's job is to catch the Golden Snitch, a small, fast-flying ball that, when caught, earns the team 150 points and usually ends the game. Quidditch is a thrilling and highly competitive sport in the wizarding world, and it plays a significant role in the Harry Potter series, particularly in the school's inter-house competitions."
