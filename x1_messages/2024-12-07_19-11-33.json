        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a basket with 5 red apples and 3 green apples, making a total of 8 apples. We're going to pick two apples one after the other, and we eat the first one before picking the second. We need to find the probability that both apples are red.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the event is picking two red apples in a row.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **First pick:** We're picking one apple out of 8, and we want it to be red. There are 5 red apples, so the probability of picking a red apple first is 5/8.\n\n2. **Second pick:** After eating the first apple, we don't put it back, so now there are only 7 apples left in the basket. If the first apple was red (which we assume it was, since we're looking for the probability that both are red), then there are now 4 red apples left.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red apple second, given that the first one was red, is 4/7.\n\nNow, to find the probability of both events happening together (both apples being red), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the total probability is (5/8) * (4/7).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(5/8) * (4/7) = (5 * 4) / (8 * 7) = 20 / 56.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\n56 \u00f7 4 = 14\n\nSo, 5/14.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both apples are red is 5/14.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 apples out of 8 is \"8 choose 2\", which is calculated as 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = (8*7)/2 = 28.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red apples out of 5 is \"5 choose 2\", which is (5*4)/2 = 10.\n\nSo, the probability is 10 / 28, which simplifies to 5/14.\n\nThat matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probabilities step by step.\n\nProbability of first red apple: 5/8.\n\nGiven that the first was red, probability of second red apple: 4/7.\n\nMultiply them: (5/8)*(4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14.\n\nAlternatively, if the first apple was green, but we're only interested in the scenario where both are red, so we don't need to consider that path.\n\nWait, actually, to be thorough, maybe we should consider all possible scenarios.\n\nBut no, since we're only interested in the case where both are red, we can stick with the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the probability of picking two red apples using permutations.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two red apples in order is 5 options for the first pick and 4 for the second, so 5*4=20.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any two apples in order is 8*7=56.\n\nSo, again, 20/56=5/14.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think 5/14 is the correct probability that both apples are red.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{14}} \\]"
