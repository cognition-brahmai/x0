        "content": "So, the train is moving at a steady speed of 60 kilometers per hour, and it takes 3 hours to go from one city to another. We need to find out how far apart these two cities are.\n\nWell, to figure out the distance, I remember that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, if the speed is 60 km/h and the time is 3 hours, I can just multiply these two values together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 km/h \u00d7 3 h\n\nNow, when I multiply these, the hours unit in the speed and the time will cancel out, leaving me with kilometers.\n\nSo, 60 times 3 is 180.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two cities is 180 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using the formula for speed or time.\n\nI know that speed is distance divided by time, so if I rearrange that formula, I can solve for distance again.\n\nSo, speed = distance / time\n\nTherefore, distance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nYeah, same as before.\n\nOr, maybe I can think about it in terms of how far the train goes each hour.\n\nIf the train travels at 60 km per hour, that means every hour it covers 60 kilometers.\n\nSo, in one hour, it's 60 km.\n\nIn two hours, it would be 120 km.\n\nIn three hours, it would be 180 km.\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nIs there a chance that it's not a constant speed? The question says it's a constant speed of 60 km/h, so I think it's safe to assume that it doesn't change speed.\n\nBut just to be sure, I'll check if there's any information about acceleration or changes in speed.\n\nNo, it says it travels at a constant speed, so no need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure about the units.\n\nThe speed is given in kilometers per hour, and time is in hours, so the distance should come out in kilometers.\n\nNo unit conversions are needed here, which is good.\n\nAlright, so I think 180 kilometers is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the train goes 60 km each hour, and it travels for 3 hours, then total distance is 60 \u00d7 3 = 180 km.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 60 km/h \u00d7 3 h = 180 km\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
