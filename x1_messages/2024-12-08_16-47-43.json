        "content": "So, in this classroom, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 12 are boys, which means the rest are girls. So, the number of girls would be 30 minus 12, which is 18 girls.\n\nNow, we're told that 8 boys wear glasses and 6 girls wear glasses. So, to find out how many students in total wear glasses, we just add those two numbers together: 8 boys + 6 girls = 14 students wear glasses.\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen student wears glasses would be the number of students who wear glasses divided by the total number of students. So, that's 14 divided by 30.\n\nTo simplify that fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2, which gives us 7/15.\n\nSo, the probability is 7/15.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. We could also calculate the probability separately for boys and girls and then combine them.\n\nFirst, the probability that a randomly chosen student is a boy is 12/30, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nThe probability that a boy wears glasses is 8/12, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen student is a boy who wears glasses is (2/5) * (2/3) = 4/15.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a randomly chosen student is a girl is 18/30, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nThe probability that a girl wears glasses is 6/18, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen student is a girl who wears glasses is (3/5) * (1/3) = 1/5.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that a randomly chosen student wears glasses, we add those two probabilities together: 4/15 + 1/5.\n\nSince 1/5 is the same as 3/15, adding them gives us 4/15 + 3/15 = 7/15.\n\nSo, again, we get the same answer: 7/15.\n\nAlternatively, we could express this as a decimal or a percentage.\n\nTo convert 7/15 to a decimal, we divide 7 by 15, which is approximately 0.4667.\n\nTo express that as a percentage, we multiply by 100, so it's about 46.67%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 46.67% chance that a randomly chosen student wears glasses.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form of the answer, 7/15 is fine.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check the initial approach.\n\nWe have 30 students: 12 boys and 18 girls.\n\n8 boys wear glasses, and 6 girls wear glasses.\n\nTotal students wearing glasses: 8 + 6 = 14.\n\nProbability: 14/30 = 7/15.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nThe proportion of boys wearing glasses is 8/12 = 2/3.\n\nThe proportion of girls wearing glasses is 6/18 = 1/3.\n\nThe overall proportion of students wearing glasses would be a weighted average based on the proportion of boys and girls in the class.\n\nSo, overall proportion = (proportion of boys * proportion of boys wearing glasses) + (proportion of girls * proportion of girls wearing glasses).\n\nWhich is (12/30 * 2/3) + (18/30 * 1/3) = (4/15) + (6/30) = 4/15 + 1/5 = 4/15 + 3/15 = 7/15.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's confirmed: the probability is 7/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{15}} \\]"
