        "content": "So I've got this problem about a car rental company managing its fleet. They have 1,000 vehicles right now, with an average age of 2 years. Each car lasts 5 years before it needs to be replaced. They want to keep the fleet size constant at 1,000 vehicles, but there's also a 5% annual growth in demand. I need to figure out how many vehicles they need to buy each year to handle both replacements and the growth.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening with the fleet over time. Each car is used for 5 years, so every year, a portion of the fleet needs to be replaced. Since the average age is 2 years, it means that not all cars are being replaced at the same time; their replacements are spread out.\n\nBut to keep it simple, if the fleet size is constant at 1,000 vehicles, and each vehicle is replaced every 5 years, then annually, they need to replace 1/5 of the fleet. That would be 1,000 / 5 = 200 vehicles per year.\n\nHowever, there's also a 5% annual growth in demand. So, each year, they need to not only replace the old vehicles but also add to the fleet to meet the growing demand.\n\nLet me think about how growth affects this. If demand grows by 5% each year, the fleet size needs to increase by 5% each year to meet that demand.\n\nSo, in year 1, the fleet size should be 1,000 + 5% of 1,000 = 1,050 vehicles.\n\nIn year 2, it should be 1,050 + 5% of 1,050 = 1,102.5, but since we can't have half a vehicle, we'll probably round to 1,103 vehicles.\n\nBut wait, the problem says they want to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles, taking into account the 5% growth in demand. That seems a bit contradictory. If they want to maintain a constant fleet size, but demand is growing, they'd need to increase the fleet to meet that demand. Unless \"maintain a constant fleet size\" means they don't want to change the number of vehicles they own, but still account for the growing demand.\n\nMaybe I need to interpret it as they want to keep the number of vehicles at 1,000, but to accommodate the 5% growth in demand, they need to turn over vehicles more quickly or something. But that doesn't make much sense because if they have more demand, they'd need more vehicles, unless they're renting the same vehicles more frequently.\n\nWait, perhaps the company is set on not increasing the fleet size beyond 1,000 vehicles, but still wants to accommodate the growing demand. In that case, they'd need to turn over vehicles more quickly, meaning shorter lifespans.\n\nBut the problem says each vehicle has a lifespan of 5 years before it needs to be replaced. So, maybe that lifespan is fixed, and they need to replace vehicles every 5 years regardless of demand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5% growth in demand is separate from the fleet replacement.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nIf the fleet size is to remain constant at 1,000 vehicles, and each vehicle lasts 5 years, then annually, they need to replace 1/5 of the fleet, which is 200 vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there's a 5% growth in demand. So, to meet the growing demand, they need to increase the fleet size by 5% each year.\n\nBut if they want to maintain a constant fleet size, they can't actually increase the fleet. So, perhaps they need to replace more vehicles to accommodate the higher demand.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of effective fleet size, considering that higher demand might mean more wear and tear, leading to shorter lifespans.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5% growth in demand translates to needing 5% more vehicle Rentals or something, but the fleet size remains the same.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nThey have 1,000 vehicles, average age 2 years, each lasts 5 years. They want to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles, but account for a 5% annual growth in demand.\n\nFirst, without considering demand growth, to maintain 1,000 vehicles with a 5-year lifespan, they need to replace 200 vehicles per year (since 1,000 / 5 = 200).\n\nNow, with a 5% annual growth in demand, they need to increase the number of vehicles to meet that demand. So, each year, the desired fleet size increases by 5%.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the fleet size in year n as F_n.\n\nInitially, F_0 = 1,000.\n\nIn year 1, desired fleet size F_1 = F_0 * 1.05 = 1,050.\n\nIn year 2, F_2 = F_1 * 1.05 = 1,050 * 1.05 = 1,102.5 \u2248 1,103.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut they want to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles. So, they can't actually increase the fleet size to 1,050 in year 1.\n\nWait, maybe \"maintain a constant fleet size\" means they don't want to change the number of vehicles they own, but they need to account for the fact that demand is growing, so they need to replace vehicles more quickly to meet the higher demand.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the effective lifespan of each vehicle is reduced due to higher usage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they need to purchase additional vehicles to meet the growing demand, on top of replacing the old ones.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of total vehicle-years needed.\n\nEach vehicle can provide service for 5 years.\n\nWith a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles, over 5 years, they can provide 1,000 * 5 = 5,000 vehicle-years of service.\n\nBut with a 5% annual growth in demand, the required vehicle-years increases each year.\n\nLet\u2019s define the demand in year n as D_n.\n\nAssume that initially, D_0 = 1,000 vehicle-years (since each of the 1,000 vehicles is used for one year).\n\nIn year 1, D_1 = D_0 * 1.05 = 1,050 vehicle-years.\n\nIn year 2, D_2 = D_1 * 1.05 = 1,050 * 1.05 = 1,102.5 vehicle-years.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut each vehicle can provide up to 5 vehicle-years of service.\n\nSo, to meet the increasing demand, they need to have more vehicles in service each year.\n\nWait, but the problem says they want to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles. So, they can't have more vehicles in service.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the 5% growth in demand means that each year, they need to provide 5% more rentals or vehicle usage.\n\nIf each vehicle can be rented out multiple times in a year, then with higher demand, they might rent each vehicle out more frequently, but the number of vehicles remains the same.\n\nIn that case, they still need to replace 200 vehicles per year to maintain the fleet.\n\nBut maybe the growing demand means that vehicles are being used more intensively, leading to faster depreciation and possibly shorter lifespans.\n\nIf that's the case, then they might need to replace vehicles more frequently, i.e., before the 5-year mark.\n\nBut the problem states that each vehicle has a lifespan of 5 years before it needs to be replaced, regardless of usage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5% growth in demand translates to needing 5% more vehicles each year to meet that demand.\n\nBut if they want to maintain a constant fleet size, that would be impossible unless they can increase the usage rate per vehicle.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should approach it from a different angle.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that with a 5% annual growth in demand, the number of vehicle-years needed increases by 5% each year.\n\nTo meet that demand with a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles, each vehicle would need to be used more intensively.\n\nHowever, if the vehicles still have a lifespan of 5 years, then the replacement rate remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, if the increased usage leads to shorter lifespans, then vehicles need to be replaced more frequently.\n\nBut the problem states that each vehicle has a lifespan of 5 years, regardless of usage.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5% growth in demand means that they need to operate more vehicles, but they are constrained by some factor to keep the fleet size at 1,000.\n\nIn that case, they might need to maximize the usage of each vehicle.\n\nBut in terms of replacements, if each vehicle still lasts 5 years, then they need to replace 200 vehicles per year.\n\nAdditionally, to accommodate the 5% growth in demand, they might need to purchase extra vehicles beyond the replacements.\n\nBut the problem says they want to maintain a constant fleet size, so they can't increase the number of vehicles.\n\nWait, maybe what they need to do is to replace vehicles more frequently to meet the higher demand.\n\nFor example, if demand grows by 5%, they might need to replace more than 200 vehicles per year to have newer vehicles that can meet the higher demand.\n\nBut the problem states that each vehicle has a lifespan of 5 years, so they can't really replace them more frequently unless the lifespan is shortened due to higher usage.\n\nBut it says the lifespan is 5 years regardless of usage.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to simplify it.\n\nAssume that to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles with a 5-year lifespan, they need to replace 200 vehicles per year.\n\nAdditionally, to account for the 5% annual growth in demand, they need to increase the fleet size by 5% each year.\n\nBut if they want to maintain a constant fleet size, they can't do that.\n\nSo, perhaps they need to purchase enough vehicles to replace the old ones and add enough to account for the growth.\n\nBut again, if they add vehicles to account for growth, the fleet size isn't constant.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find out how many vehicles they need to purchase annually to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles while accounting for the 5% growth in demand.\n\nIn that case, they need to replace the 200 vehicles that reach the end of their lifespan and also add enough vehicles to account for the 5% growth.\n\nSo, the total purchases would be the replacements plus the additions for growth.\n\nFirst, replacements: 200 vehicles per year.\n\nSecond, additions for growth: 5% of the current fleet size.\n\nInitially, 5% of 1,000 is 50 vehicles.\n\nSo, total purchases in year 1: 200 + 50 = 250 vehicles.\n\nBut then, in year 2, the fleet size would be 1,000 + 50 = 1,050 vehicles.\n\nSo, replacements would be 1,050 / 5 = 210 vehicles.\n\nAdditions for growth: 5% of 1,050 = 52.5 \u2248 53 vehicles.\n\nTotal purchases in year 2: 210 + 53 = 263 vehicles.\n\nAnd this would continue each year, with increasing purchases.\n\nBut the problem says to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles.\n\nSo, perhaps they need to add vehicles to account for growth and replace the old ones, but then sell or retire some vehicles to keep the fleet size at 1,000.\n\nWait, if they add 50 vehicles in year 1 to account for growth, and replace 200, but then to maintain 1,000 vehicles, they need to retire or sell 50 vehicles.\n\nIn that case, net addition is zero, and the fleet size remains 1,000.\n\nSimilarly, in year 2, they add 52.5 vehicles for growth and replace 210, then sell 52.5 + X to maintain 1,000 vehicles.\n\nThis is getting too complicated, and I'm not sure if this is the right approach.\n\nMaybe I should consider it in terms of the effective annual replacement rate plus the growth rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of vehicles to be purchased annually is the sum of the replacements and the additions for growth.\n\nGiven that, in year 1, replacements are 200 vehicles, and additions for growth are 5% of 1,000 = 50 vehicles, so total purchases are 250 vehicles.\n\nThen, in year 2, replacements are 210 vehicles (since fleet size is now 1,050), and additions for growth are 5% of 1,050 = 52.5 \u2248 53 vehicles, so total purchases are 263 vehicles.\n\nBut the problem says to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles.\n\nSo, perhaps they need to purchase 250 vehicles in year 1, but then sell or retire 100 vehicles to maintain the fleet size at 1,000.\n\nWait, initial fleet: 1,000 vehicles.\n\nPurchase 250 vehicles (200 replacements + 50 for growth).\n\nThen, to maintain fleet size at 1,000, they need to sell or retire 150 vehicles.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because they've added 50 vehicles for growth and replaced 200, so the net should be an increase of 50 vehicles.\n\nTo maintain 1,000 vehicles, they need to sell or retire 50 vehicles.\n\nWait, initial fleet: 1,000 vehicles.\n\nPurchase 250 vehicles (200 replacements + 50 for growth).\n\nThen, to maintain 1,000 vehicles, they need to retire 200 vehicles (the old ones) plus the excess 50, totaling 250 vehicles.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, initial fleet: 1,000 vehicles.\n\nPurchase 250 new vehicles.\n\nRetire the oldest 200 vehicles (since they've reached 5 years) and sell 50 vehicles to maintain the fleet size at 1,000.\n\nIn that case, the net addition is zero, and the fleet size remains 1,000.\n\nBut effectively, they're replacing 200 vehicles and adding 50 for growth, then selling 50 vehicles to keep the fleet at 1,000.\n\nSo, total purchases are 250 vehicles per year.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they don't sell any vehicles; they just maintain the fleet size at 1,000 by only keeping the new purchases and retiring the old ones.\n\nBut again, with growth, they need to increase the fleet size.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the fleet needs to grow by 5% each year to meet the increasing demand.\n\nSo, the number of vehicles needed in year n is F_n = F_{n-1} * 1.05.\n\nBut they also need to replace vehicles that have reached the end of their 5-year lifespan.\n\nSo, each year, they need to replace the vehicles that are 5 years old.\n\nGiven that the average age is currently 2 years, it means that the fleet has a distribution of ages.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I can model this as a steady-state system where the number of vehicles purchased each year covers both replacements and growth.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of vehicles to be purchased each year as P.\n\nEach year, they need to replace 1/5 of the fleet, which is P/1.05^4, because the fleet is growing by 5% each year.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use the concept of present value or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up an equation where the number of purchases equals the number of replacements plus the number needed for growth.\n\nLet\u2019s say that in year n, the fleet size is F_n.\n\nThen, F_n = F_{n-1} * 1.05.\n\nThe number of replacements needed is F_{n-1} / 5.\n\nSo, total purchases P_n = (F_{n-1} / 5) + (F_{n-1} * 0.05).\n\nSimplify: P_n = F_{n-1} (0.2 + 0.05) = F_{n-1} * 0.25.\n\nBut F_{n-1} = 1,000 in the first year.\n\nSo, P_1 = 1,000 * 0.25 = 250 vehicles.\n\nThen, F_1 = 1,000 * 1.05 = 1,050 vehicles.\n\nP_2 = 1,050 * 0.25 = 262.5 \u2248 263 vehicles.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut the problem says to maintain a constant fleet size of 1,000 vehicles.\n\nSo, perhaps they need to adjust the fleet size by selling vehicles to maintain the count at 1,000.\n\nIn year 1: purchase 250 vehicles, but then sell 150 vehicles to maintain 1,000 vehicles.\n\nIn year 2: purchase 263 vehicles, then sell 163 vehicles to maintain 1,000 vehicles.\n\nBut this seems inefficient and perhaps not the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"maintain a constant fleet size\" means that they don't want the fleet size to grow, despite the increasing demand.\n\nIn that case, they need to manage the demand with the existing fleet by renting vehicles more frequently or possibly extending the usage beyond the 5-year mark, but the problem states that vehicles need to be replaced after 5 years.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should just calculate the number of vehicles to be purchased annually to account for both replacements and the 5% growth in demand, assuming the fleet size is allowed to grow.\n\nSo, in year 1: purchase 250 vehicles, fleet size becomes 1,000 + 250 - 200 (replacements) = 1,050 vehicles.\n\nIn year 2: purchase 263 vehicles, fleet size becomes 1,050 + 263 - 210 = 1,103 vehicles.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut the problem says to maintain a constant fleet size, which contradicts allowing the fleet size to grow.\n\nI think there's some confusion in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"maintain a constant fleet size\" means that they don't want the number of vehicles they own to increase, but they need to accommodate higher demand through other means, like renting the same vehicles more frequently.\n\nIn that case, they still need to replace 200 vehicles per year, but they don't need to purchase additional vehicles for growth because they're not increasing the fleet size.\n\nHowever, that doesn't account for the growing demand; they'd just be serving more demand with the same number of vehicles, which might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they need to replace vehicles more frequently to handle the higher demand, effectively reducing the lifespan of each vehicle.\n\nBut the problem states that each vehicle has a 5-year lifespan.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should just stick with the initial calculation: replace 200 vehicles per year and add 5% of the fleet size for growth, which is 50 vehicles in the first year, totaling 250 purchases per year.\n\nThen, to maintain a fleet size of 1,000, they would need to sell or retire the excess vehicles.\n\nBut that seems inefficient, and perhaps not the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5% growth in demand is already accounted for in the replacement rate, but I'm not sure how.\n\nAt this point, I think the simplest approach is to calculate the number of vehicles to be purchased annually to replace the old ones and account for the growth in demand.\n\nSo, replacements: 1,000 / 5 = 200 vehicles per year.\n\nAdditions for growth: 5% of 1,000 = 50 vehicles.\n\nTotal purchases: 200 + 50 = 250 vehicles per year.\n\nThen, to maintain a fleet size of 1,000, they would need to retire or sell 50 vehicles per year.\n\nBut again, that contradicts the \"constant fleet size\" requirement because adding 250 and retiring 50 would increase the fleet size.\n\nWait, no. If they start with 1,000 vehicles, add 250, and retire 200 (replacements) + sell 50, the net is zero, and the fleet remains at 1,000.\n\nSo, total purchases per year: 250 vehicles.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of vehicles to be purchased annually is 250, as calculated, and they don't need to sell any; instead, the fleet size increases to meet demand.\n\nBut the problem specifies maintaining a constant fleet size.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should look for similar problems or seek clarification on what \"maintain a constant fleet size\" means in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company cannot maintain a constant fleet size while accounting for 5% annual growth in demand; they would need to increase the fleet size.\n\nBut the problem says they want to maintain a constant fleet size, so perhaps they need to manage demand through other means, like increasing rental rates or denying some rentals.\n\nBut that's not directly related to fleet management.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll stick with the initial calculation: purchase 250 vehicles per year to account for replacements and growth, and sell 50 vehicles annually to maintain the fleet size at 1,000.\n\nTherefore, the number of vehicles to be purchased annually is 250.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
