The expansion will cover an area of 50 acres, with 70% dedicated to animal enclosures and 30% for visitor amenities like restaurants, restrooms, and gift shops. Calculate the total area allocated for each purpose. Additionally, estimate the number of new animals that can be accommodated in the expanded zoo, considering that each enclosure requires an average of 0.5 acres per species and houses an average of 10 animals per species."

        "content": "So the zoo is planning to expand over 50 acres, and they're splitting it up with 70% for animal enclosures and 30% for visitor amenities. First, I need to calculate how much area each part gets.\n\nTo find the area for animal enclosures, I'll take 70% of 50 acres. That should be 0.7 times 50, right? Let me do the math: 0.7 \u00d7 50 = 35 acres. So, 35 acres are allocated for animal enclosures.\n\nNext, for visitor amenities, it's 30% of 50 acres. That's 0.3 times 50, which is 15 acres. So, 15 acres for things like restaurants, restrooms, and gift shops.\n\nNow, to estimate how many new animals can be accommodated, I need to consider that each enclosure requires an average of 0.5 acres per species and houses an average of 10 animals per species.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many species can be accommodated in the 35 acres allocated for enclosures. If each species needs 0.5 acres, then the number of species is the total enclosure area divided by the area per species. So, 35 acres \u00f7 0.5 acres per species = 70 species.\n\nEach species houses an average of 10 animals, so the total number of animals would be the number of species times the average number of animals per species. That's 70 species \u00d7 10 animals per species = 700 animals.\n\nWait a minute, but this is for the entire enclosure area. If the zoo is expanding, it's probably adding new enclosures for new species or expanding existing ones. Maybe I need to think about only the new area for animal enclosures.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, it seems like the 35 acres are specifically for new animal enclosures. So, assuming that, the calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 35 acres include both new and existing enclosures, but the question seems to be about the expansion, so I think it's safe to assume that the 35 acres are for new enclosures.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Area for animal enclosures: 35 acres\n\n- Area for visitor amenities: 15 acres\n\n- Number of new species that can be accommodated: 70\n\n- Total number of new animals: 700\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]"
