        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains moving towards each other from Station A and Station B, which are 500 miles apart. The first train from Station A is going at 60 mph, and the second train from Station B is going at 40 mph. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nOkay, so since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. That makes sense because the closer they get, the faster they approach each other. So, the combined speed should be 60 mph plus 40 mph, which is 100 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two stations is 500 miles. If they're moving towards each other at a combined speed of 100 mph, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 500 miles / 100 mph\n\nThat gives:\n\nTime = 5 hours\n\nSo, it should take 5 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nLet's think about it in terms of relative speed. The relative speed when two objects are moving towards each other is indeed the sum of their individual speeds. So, 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph. That seems correct.\n\nNow, dividing the distance by the relative speed should give the time until they meet. 500 miles divided by 100 mph does equal 5 hours. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how far each train travels in a certain amount of time and set up an equation where the sum of the distances equals 500 miles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time as t hours.\n\nDistance traveled by the first train: 60t miles\n\nDistance traveled by the second train: 40t miles\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of these distances should be equal to the total distance between the stations:\n\n60t + 40t = 500\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n100t = 500\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 500 / 100\n\nt = 5 hours\n\nAgain, I get 5 hours. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nMaybe I can consider another approach. Let's think about how long it takes for each train to cover their respective portions of the distance.\n\nBut wait, since they're moving towards each other, it's simpler to use the combined speed approach, which is what I did initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the time based on one train's perspective.\n\nFor example, take the first train going at 60 mph. From its perspective, the second train is approaching at 40 mph, so the relative speed is still 100 mph. Then, time = distance / relative speed, which is again 500 / 100 = 5 hours.\n\nOr, consider the second train going at 40 mph. From its perspective, the first train is approaching at 60 mph, so again, relative speed is 100 mph, and time is 500 / 100 = 5 hours.\n\nSeems consistent across different perspectives.\n\nI was wondering if there's any other factor I should consider, like the length of the trains or any acceleration, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It seems like both trains are moving at constant speeds.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the starting times are exactly simultaneous, but the problem says \"at the same time,\" so that's fine.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer using different methods, and all of them point to 5 hours. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
