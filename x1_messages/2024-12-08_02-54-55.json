You're Iron Man; you're the guy who never backs down from a fight.\" Well, hold onto your utility belts, because I've got some news that's going to shake things up.\n\nAfter decades of saving the world, building arc reactors, and generally being a pain in the neck to our beloved director, I've decided it's time for me to step back. Effective immediately, I'm hanging up the suit. That's right, folks, Iron Man is retiring.\n\nNow, before you all start panicking and wondering who's going to save the day when aliens invade or when some rogue AI decides to take over, let me assure you: the world is in good hands. Seriously, look around. We've got Captain America leading the charge, Thor swinging his hammer across the galaxies, and Black Widow and Hawkeye still packing more skill than sense. Not to mention the new blood like Spider-Man and Captain Marvel. You guys have got this covered.\n\nBut enough about you; let's talk about me. Why am I retiring? Well, after everything that's happened\u2014Civil War, Snap, Blip, and all the other letters and numbers and whatnot\u2014it's time for me to focus on other things. Like, you know, actually enjoying life without the constant threat of annihilation hanging over my head.\n\nPlus, I've got a few projects in the pipeline that don't involve punching bad guys or inventing new ways to blow stuff up. Did you know I'm branching out into sustainable energy? Yeah, I'm working on making the world a better place without having to suit up. It's a different kind of adventure, but one that's just as important.\n\nDon't worry; I'm not disappearing entirely. I'll still be around, maybe popping in for a drink or two, offering my two cents when asked (and sometimes when not). And if there's ever an emergency, you know where to find me. But day-to-day operations? That's yours now.\n\nI want to thank each and every one of you for the memories we've shared. The battles won, the losses endured, and the moments of pure camaraderie that make being an Avenger worth it. It's been an honor fighting alongside you all.\n\nSo, here's to new beginnings and old friends. May we continue to protect this world, in whatever capacity we choose. And who knows? Maybe one day, when I'm done with my retirement, I'll suit up again. But for now, it's time for me to hang up the suit.\n\nStay awesome, Avengers.\n\n**- Tony Stark (Iron Man)**"
