        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people in the room, and they each have an equal number of apples. The total number of apples is 25. So, to find out how many apples each person has initially, I can divide the total number of apples by the number of people.\n\nSo, 25 apples divided by 5 people equals 5 apples per person.\n\nNow, the question is, if we add two more people to the room, how many apples does each person have?\n\nWait a minute, the total number of apples is still 25, right? Because it doesn't say that more apples are added, just more people.\n\nSo, now there are 5 original people plus 2 more, making a total of 7 people.\n\nIf the 25 apples are still being shared equally among all 7 people, then each person would have 25 divided by 7 apples.\n\n25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57 apples per person.\n\nBut the question might be expecting an exact answer, so maybe it's better to leave it as a fraction.\n\n25 divided by 7 is 25/7, which is approximately 3 and 4/7 apples per person.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nInitially, 5 people have 25 apples in total, so each has 5 apples.\n\nThen, 2 more people enter, making it 7 people.\n\nIf the apples are redistibuted equally among the 7 people, each would get 25/7 apples.\n\nSo, the answer should be 25/7 apples per person.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{7}} \\]"
