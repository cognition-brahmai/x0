It's a central element in the cosmology of the Norse people, linking together Asgard, Midgard, and the other realms. The roots of Yggdrasil extend down to the wells and realms of the gods, giants, and the dead, and its branches stretch up to the heavens. It's a symbol of the interconnectedness of all things in the Norse universe."
