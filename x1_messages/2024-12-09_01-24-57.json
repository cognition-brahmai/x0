        "content": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about two trains moving towards each other from different stations. Station B is 320 kilometers east of Station A. One train is going east from Station A at 80 kilometers per hour, and the other is going west from Station B at 120 kilometers per hour. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the situation. So, Station A and Station B are 320 km apart, with Station B being east of Station A. Train from A is moving east, and train from B is moving west. Wait, actually, if Station B is east of Station A, and the train from A is moving east, while the train from B is moving west, they are moving towards each other.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, they're approaching each other from both ends.\n\nNow, to find out when they'll meet, I need to figure out how their speeds combine and how that affects the time it takes for them to cover the distance between them.\n\nI recall that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, in this case, the relative speed would be 80 km/h plus 120 km/h, which is 200 km/h.\n\nSo, the combined speed at which they're closing the distance is 200 km per hour.\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is 320 km.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time = 320 km / 200 km/h\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n320 divided by 200 is 1.6 hours.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express that in hours and minutes. 0.6 hours is 36 minutes, because 0.6 times 60 minutes is 36 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time is 1 hour and 36 minutes.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I've done this correctly.\n\nLet me think again. The train from A is going east at 80 km/h, and the train from B is going west at 120 km/h. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up, which is 200 km/h.\n\nYes, and the distance is 320 km.\n\nSo, time = 320 / 200 = 1.6 hours, which is indeed 1 hour and 36 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a fraction.\n\n1.6 hours is 8/5 hours, since 1.6 is 8/5.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects the answer in hours and minutes, or just in decimal hours.\n\nAnyway, I think 1.6 hours is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nSuppose I consider the position of both trains as a function of time.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time in hours as t.\n\nThe train from A is moving east at 80 km/h, so its position after t hours is 80t km east of Station A.\n\nThe train from B is moving west at 120 km/h, so its position after t hours is 320 km (initial distance) minus 120t km, because it's moving towards Station A.\n\nThey meet when their positions are equal, right?\n\nSo, 80t = 320 - 120t\n\nNow, solve for t.\n\n80t + 120t = 320\n\n200t = 320\n\nt = 320 / 200\n\nt = 1.6 hours\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, that gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nMaybe I can think about it another way. If I consider the speed at which the distance between them is decreasing, it's 200 km/h, as I said before.\n\nSo, starting from 320 km apart, at 200 km/h, the time to meet is indeed 1.6 hours.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of each train covering a portion of the distance.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and the initial approach seems solid.\n\nSo, I conclude that it will take 1.6 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.6 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
