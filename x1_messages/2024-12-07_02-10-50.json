        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a committee with some specific conditions. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. There are 12 men and 7 women in a group, and I need to form a committee of 5 people with at least 3 women. So, that means the committee can have 3 women and 2 men, or 4 women and 1 man, or even 5 women and no men. I need to find out how many different ways this can be done.\n\nFirst, I recall that when choosing people from a group without any restrictions, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nBut here, there are restrictions because I need at least 3 women in the committee. So, I need to consider different cases based on the number of women in the committee.\n\nLet me list out the possible scenarios:\n\n1. 3 women and 2 men\n\n2. 4 women and 1 man\n\n3. 5 women and 0 men\n\nI think I need to calculate the number of ways for each scenario and then add them up to get the total number of possible committees.\n\nStarting with the first scenario: 3 women and 2 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 women from 7 women is C(7, 3).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 men from 12 men is C(12, 2).\n\nSo, the total number of ways for this scenario is C(7, 3) * C(12, 2).\n\nLet me calculate C(7, 3):\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (6 * 4!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / 6 = 7 * 5 * 1 = 35\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, 7! is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, and 3! is 6, and (7 - 3)! is 4!, which is 24.\n\nSo, C(7, 3) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (6 * 24) = (7 * 6 * 5) / 6 = 7 * 5 = 35.\n\nOkay, that's correct.\n\nNow, C(12, 2):\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = (12 * 11 * 10!) / (2 * 10!)) = (12 * 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, for the first scenario, it's 35 * 66 = 2310.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication.\n\n35 * 66:\n\n35 * 60 = 2100\n\n35 * 6 = 210\n\nTotal = 2100 + 210 = 2310. Yep.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: 4 women and 1 man.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 4 women from 7 is C(7, 4).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 man from 12 is C(12, 1).\n\nSo, total for this scenario is C(7, 4) * C(12, 1).\n\nCalculate C(7, 4):\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * 3!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (24 * 6) = (7 * 6 * 5) / 24 = (210) / 24.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, 7! is 5040, 4! is 24, and 3! is 6.\n\nSo, C(7, 4) = 5040 / (24 * 6) = 5040 / 144 = 35.\n\nWait, that can't be right because C(7, 3) was 35, and C(7, 4) should be C(7, 3), since C(n, k) = C(n, n - k).\n\nOh, right, C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) = 35.\n\nSo, 35 * C(12, 1) = 35 * 12 = 420.\n\nAlright.\n\nNow, the third scenario: 5 women and 0 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 5 women from 7 is C(7, 5).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 0 men from 12 is C(12, 0), which is 1.\n\nSo, total for this scenario is C(7, 5) * 1 = C(7, 5).\n\nCalculate C(7, 5):\n\nAgain, C(7, 5) = C(7, 2) = (7 * 6) / 2 = 21.\n\nSo, 21 * 1 = 21.\n\nNow, to get the total number of possible committees, I need to add up all these scenarios:\n\n2310 (from scenario 1) + 420 (from scenario 2) + 21 (from scenario 3) = 2310 + 420 = 2730, plus 21 is 2751.\n\nSo, the total number of different committees is 2751.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst scenario: C(7, 3) * C(12, 2) = 35 * 66 = 2310. That seems correct.\n\nSecond scenario: C(7, 4) * C(12, 1) = 35 * 12 = 420. Correct.\n\nThird scenario: C(7, 5) * C(12, 0) = 21 * 1 = 21. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 2310 + 420 = 2730, and 2730 + 21 = 2751.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 2751.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that have fewer than 3 women.\n\nTotal number of committees without restrictions is C(19, 5), since there are 12 men + 7 women = 19 people.\n\nC(19, 5) = 19! / (5! * 14!) = (19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14!) / (120 * 14!)) = (19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15) / 120.\n\nCalculate numerator: 19 * 18 = 342, 342 * 17 = 5814, 5814 * 16 = 93024, 93024 * 15 = 1,395,360.\n\nDenominator is 120.\n\nSo, 1,395,360 / 120 = 11,628.\n\nSo, total unrestricted committees is 11,628.\n\nNow, committees with fewer than 3 women: that means committees with 0, 1, or 2 women.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the number of committees with 0 women and 5 men, plus committees with 1 woman and 4 men, plus committees with 2 women and 3 men.\n\nCalculate each:\n\n1. 0 women and 5 men: C(7, 0) * C(12, 5)\n\nC(7, 0) = 1\n\nC(12, 5) = 792 (I think, let me verify.\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * 7!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7!) / (120 * 7!)) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / 120 = (95,040) / 120 = 792.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, 1 * 792 = 792.\n\n2. 1 woman and 4 men: C(7, 1) * C(12, 4)\n\nC(7, 1) = 7\n\nC(12, 4) = 495 (let me confirm.\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8!) / (24 * 8!)) = (11,880) / 24 = 495.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, 7 * 495 = 3,465.\n\n3. 2 women and 3 men: C(7, 2) * C(12, 3)\n\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nC(12, 3) = 220\n\nSo, 21 * 220 = 4,620.\n\nNow, add these up: 792 + 3,465 = 4,257, plus 4,620 = 8,877.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total number of unrestricted committees is 11,628, and if I subtract 8,877 from it, I get 11,628 - 8,877 = 2,751.\n\nHmm, that matches the previous result I got by adding the scenarios with at least 3 women.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 2,751.\n\nTherefore, the number of different committees that can be formed with at least 3 women is 2,751.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2751} \\]"
