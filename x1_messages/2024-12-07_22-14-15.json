        "content": "Non-avian dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago in an event known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. There are several theories about what caused this extinction, but the most widely accepted one is that a massive asteroid impact triggered a chain of ecological disasters that led to the demise of the dinosaurs.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Asteroid Impact**: A large asteroid, estimated to be about 10 kilometers (6 miles) in diameter, struck the Earth near the present-day Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. This impact created the Chicxulub crater, which is more than 180 kilometers (110 miles) in diameter.\n\n2. **Environmental Catastrophe**: The impact released an enormous amount of energy, equivalent to billions of atomic bombs. This caused massive wildfires, tsunamis, and a \"nuclear winter\" effect due to dust and debris blocking sunlight.\n\n3. **Climate Change**: The blocking of sunlight led to a significant drop in global temperatures, disrupting plant growth and disrupting the food chain. Many species, including dinosaurs, could not adapt to these rapid environmental changes.\n\n4. **Volcanic Activity**: Some scientists also suggest that volcanic activity, particularly in the Deccan Traps in present-day India, may have contributed to the extinction event by releasing massive amounts of sulfur and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, further altering the climate.\n\n5. **Multiple Factors**: It's possible that a combination of these factors\u2014asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and perhaps other environmental stresses\u2014collectively led to the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nIt's important to note that not all dinosaur species died out; birds are considered the descendants of avian dinosaurs and are therefore the only lineage of dinosaurs that survived this extinction event."
