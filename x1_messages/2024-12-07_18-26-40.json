        "content": "Let's see. I've got this election problem here. Candidate A got 55% of the total votes, candidate B got 40%, and the remaining 5% were invalid or blank votes. There were 20,000 valid votes cast for both candidates combined, and I need to find out how many more votes candidate A received compared to candidate B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's meant by \"valid votes cast for both candidates combined.\" Since the 5% invalid votes are separate, the 20,000 votes consist only of votes for candidates A and B, which add up to 95% of the total votes (because 55% + 40% = 95%).\n\nWait, but the problem says there were 20,000 valid votes cast for both candidates combined, and the remaining 5% were invalid. So, the total votes should be the sum of valid votes (20,000) and the invalid votes (5% of total votes).\n\nLet me denote the total number of votes as T. Then, the valid votes are 95% of T, which equals 20,000. So, 0.95T = 20,000.\n\nFrom this, I can solve for T:\n\nT = 20,000 / 0.95\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n20,000 divided by 0.95 is 21,052.631578947368. Since the number of votes should be a whole number, maybe I need to round it. But for now, I'll keep it as is.\n\nNow, candidate A received 55% of T, and candidate B received 40% of T.\n\nSo, votes for A = 0.55 * T\n\nVotes for B = 0.40 * T\n\nThe difference between A and B's votes would be:\n\nDifference = votes for A - votes for B = (0.55T) - (0.40T) = 0.15T\n\nSince T is 21,052.631578947368, then 0.15 * 21,052.631578947368 equals approximately 3,157.894736842105.\n\nBut this doesn't make sense because the number of votes should be a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the 20,000 valid votes are 95% of the total votes.\n\nLet me rethink this. The problem says that there were 20,000 valid votes cast for both candidates combined, and 5% were invalid or blank votes. Does that mean that the total votes are 100%, out of which 5% are invalid, and the remaining 95% are valid votes, which are 20,000?\n\nWait, but if total votes are T, then valid votes are 95% of T, which is 20,000. So, T = 20,000 / 0.95, which is approximately 21,052.63. But then, candidate A has 55% of T, which is about 11,579 votes, and candidate B has 40% of T, which is about 8,421 votes. The difference would be around 3,158 votes.\n\nBut I feel like there might be a better way to approach this without dealing with the total votes and percentages.\n\nAlternatively, since the valid votes are 20,000, and candidate A has 55% of the total votes, while candidate B has 40%, but the valid votes are 95% of the total votes.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the valid votes are 95% of the total votes, and those 95% are distributed between A and B as 55% and 40% of the total votes, respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentages are directly applicable to the valid votes, meaning A has 55% of the 20,000 valid votes, and B has 40% of the 20,000 valid votes.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"candidate A received 55% of the total votes, while candidate B received 40%. The remaining 5% were invalid or blank votes. If there were 20,000 valid votes cast for both candidates combined, how many more votes did candidate A receive than candidate B?\"\n\nThe phrasing suggests that the 55% and 40% are of the total votes, including invalid votes, but the valid votes are only 95% of the total votes.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should set up equations to model the situation.\n\nLet T be the total number of votes, including invalid ones.\n\nThen:\n\nVotes for A: 0.55T\n\nVotes for B: 0.40T\n\nInvalid votes: 0.05T\n\nValid votes: votes for A + votes for B = 0.55T + 0.40T = 0.95T\n\nBut we're told that the valid votes are 20,000:\n\n0.95T = 20,000\n\nSo, T = 20,000 / 0.95 = approximately 21,052.63\n\nThen, votes for A: 0.55 * 21,052.63 \u2248 11,579.45\n\nVotes for B: 0.40 * 21,052.63 \u2248 8,421.05\n\nDifference: 11,579.45 - 8,421.05 \u2248 3,158.40\n\nAgain, we have a fractional number of votes, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the total votes should be rounded to 21,053, making the calculations:\n\nVotes for A: 0.55 * 21,053 \u2248 11,579\n\nVotes for B: 0.40 * 21,053 \u2248 8,421\n\nDifference: 11,579 - 8,421 = 3,158\n\nBut I'm not sure if rounding is the right approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentages are directly applied to the valid votes. So, A has 55% of the 20,000 valid votes, and B has 40% of the 20,000 valid votes.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nVotes for A: 0.55 * 20,000 = 11,000\n\nVotes for B: 0.40 * 20,000 = 8,000\n\nDifference: 11,000 - 8,000 = 3,000\n\nThis seems simpler, and the numbers are whole numbers, which makes sense for vote counts.\n\nBut the problem says \"candidate A received 55% of the total votes,\" which includes invalid votes, not just valid ones. So, this might not be the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the percentages are of the total votes, but the valid votes are only 95% of the total votes. So, the percentages for A and B are based on the total votes, not just the valid ones.\n\nIn that case, with T being the total votes:\n\nVotes for A: 0.55T\n\nVotes for B: 0.40T\n\nValid votes: 0.95T = 20,000\n\nSo, T = 20,000 / 0.95 \u2248 21,052.63\n\nThen, votes for A: 0.55 * 21,052.63 \u2248 11,579\n\nVotes for B: 0.40 * 21,052.63 \u2248 8,421\n\nDifference: 11,579 - 8,421 = 3,158\n\nBut again, fractional votes don't make sense. Maybe the total votes should be 21,053, making the difference 3,158.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends for the percentages to be directly applied to the valid votes, making the calculation straightforward: A has 55% of 20,000 and B has 40% of 20,000, with the difference being 15% of 20,000, which is 3,000.\n\nGiven that the first method leads to fractional votes, which are impractical, maybe the second approach is what's intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 55% and 40% are of the total votes, including invalid votes, and the valid votes are 95% of the total votes, which equals 20,000.\n\nSo, T = 20,000 / 0.95 \u2248 21,052.63\n\nBut since vote counts must be integers, maybe the total votes are 21,053, with valid votes being 0.95 * 21,053 \u2248 19,999.85, which rounds to 20,000.\n\nThen, votes for A: 0.55 * 21,053 \u2248 11,579\n\nVotes for B: 0.40 * 21,053 \u2248 8,421\n\nDifference: 11,579 - 8,421 = 3,158\n\nThis seems consistent, except for the fractional vote issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total votes are 21,053, with invalid votes being 5% of 21,053, which is approximately 1,053 votes.\n\nThen, valid votes: 21,053 - 1,053 = 20,000, which matches the given information.\n\nSo, votes for A: 0.55 * 21,053 \u2248 11,579\n\nVotes for B: 0.40 * 21,053 \u2248 8,421\n\nDifference: 11,579 - 8,421 = 3,158\n\nTherefore, candidate A received approximately 3,158 more votes than candidate B.\n\nBut I feel like there might be a simpler way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, since the valid votes are 20,000, and A has 55% of the total votes, which includes invalid votes, perhaps I can find the ratio between valid votes and total votes.\n\nWe know that valid votes are 95% of total votes, so total votes T = 20,000 / 0.95 \u2248 21,052.63\n\nAgain, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the percentages directly on the valid votes.\n\nIf A has 55% of total votes, and total votes include 5% invalid, then perhaps A's share of valid votes is (55%)/(95%) of the valid votes.\n\nSimilarly, B's share of valid votes is (40%)/(95%) of the valid votes.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, A's percentage of valid votes: (55%)/(95%) * 100% \u2248 57.89%\n\nSimilarly, B's percentage of valid votes: (40%)/(95%) * 100% \u2248 42.11%\n\nThen, votes for A: 0.5789 * 20,000 \u2248 11,579\n\nVotes for B: 0.4211 * 20,000 \u2248 8,421\n\nDifference: 11,579 - 8,421 = 3,158\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the difference in votes between candidate A and candidate B is approximately 3,158 votes.\n\nBut to be precise, let's calculate it exactly.\n\nFirst, find the total votes T:\n\n0.95T = 20,000\n\nT = 20,000 / 0.95 = 21,052.631578947368\n\nThen, votes for A: 0.55 * 21,052.631578947368 \u2248 11,579.45\n\nVotes for B: 0.40 * 21,052.631578947368 \u2248 8,421.05\n\nDifference: 11,579.45 - 8,421.05 = 3,158.4\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the difference is 3,158 votes.\n\nAlternatively, using the method of considering the percentages of valid votes:\n\nA's share of valid votes: (55/95) * 20,000 = (11/19) * 20,000 \u2248 11,578.95\n\nB's share of valid votes: (8/19) * 20,000 \u2248 8,421.05\n\nDifference: 11,578.95 - 8,421.05 = 3,157.9 \u2248 3,158\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nTherefore, candidate A received approximately 3,158 more votes than candidate B.\n\nBut to present it neatly, I'll say:\n\nCandidate A received 3,158 more votes than candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3158} \\]"
