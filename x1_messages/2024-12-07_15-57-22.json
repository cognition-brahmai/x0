        "content": "So there are 15 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total. Hmm, this sounds like a problem about combinations, where order doesn't matter.\n\nLet me think about it. If there are 15 people, and each shakes hands with every other person, then for the first person, they would shake hands with 14 others. The next person would then shake hands with 13 others, excluding the first person since they've already shaken hands with them. Wait, but that seems a bit messy.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items from n items is given by the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n - 2)!). In this case, n is 15, since there are 15 people, and we're choosing pairs of people to shake hands.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: C(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15 - 2)!)) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 13!)) = (15 \u00d7 14) / 2 = 210 / 2 = 105.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's see:\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for 15 people, the first person shakes hands with 14 others, the second with 13 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), the third with 12, and so on, until the last person, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already done so with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 14 + 13 + 12 + ... + 1. This is an arithmetic series where the first term a1 is 14, the last term an is 1, and the number of terms is 14.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by S = n/2 \u00d7 (a1 + an). So, S = 14/2 \u00d7 (14 + 1) = 7 \u00d7 15 = 105.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation using combinations. So, it seems like there are 105 handshakes in total.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's try another approach. Maybe using permutations.\n\nIf order mattered, meaning that shaking hands from person A to person B is different from person B to person A, then it would be P(15, 2) = 15 \u00d7 14 = 210. But in handshakes, order doesn't matter; shaking hands is a mutual action. So, we need to divide that by 2 to account for the fact that AB and BA are the same handshake. So, 210 / 2 = 105.\n\nAgain, it confirms the same answer: 105 handshakes.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of overlapping handshakes or some other factor I'm missing, but in this scenario, it seems straightforward. Each pair of people shakes hands exactly once, and there are no restrictions or additional conditions.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it graph theoretically, where each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. The total number of edges in a complete graph with 15 vertices is also given by C(15, 2), which again is 105.\n\nSo, all these different methods lead me to the same conclusion that there are 105 handshakes in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 105.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
