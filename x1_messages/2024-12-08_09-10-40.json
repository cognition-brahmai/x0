        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains: one leaving Town A towards Town B at 60 km/h and the other leaving Town B towards Town A at 90 km/h. The distance between the towns is 300 km. I need to find out how far apart they will be after 2 hours.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much distance each train covers in 2 hours.\n\nFor the train from Town A:\n\nSpeed = 60 km/h\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 60 km/h \u00d7 2 h = 120 km\n\nSo, it covers 120 km in 2 hours.\n\nFor the train from Town B:\n\nSpeed = 90 km/h\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 90 km/h \u00d7 2 h = 180 km\n\nSo, it covers 180 km in 2 hours.\n\nNow, since they are moving towards each other, the total distance they cover together in 2 hours is the sum of the distances they each cover:\n\nTotal distance covered together = 120 km + 180 km = 300 km\n\nWait a minute, the distance between the towns is 300 km. So, if they have covered 300 km together, that means they should have met somewhere between the towns.\n\nBut the question asks for how far apart they will be after 2 hours. If they have covered a total of 300 km towards each other in that time, and the total distance between them was 300 km, then they should have met exactly at the 2-hour mark.\n\nSo, if they have met, the distance apart should be zero.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the relative speed of the two trains since they are moving towards each other.\n\nThe relative speed is the sum of their speeds:\n\nRelative speed = 60 km/h + 90 km/h = 150 km/h\n\nThis means that the distance between them decreases at a rate of 150 km per hour.\n\nSo, in 2 hours, the distance they close is:\n\nDistance closed = Relative speed \u00d7 Time = 150 km/h \u00d7 2 h = 300 km\n\nAgain, since the initial distance was 300 km, after closing that entire distance in 2 hours, they should meet, meaning the distance apart is zero.\n\nBut the question is asking for the distance apart after 2 hours, and according to this, it should be zero.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me consider the positions of the trains after 2 hours.\n\nTrain from Town A:\n\nStarts at Town A, goes towards Town B at 60 km/h.\n\nIn 2 hours, it covers 120 km, so it is 120 km away from Town A, heading towards Town B.\n\nTrain from Town B:\n\nStarts at Town B, goes towards Town A at 90 km/h.\n\nIn 2 hours, it covers 180 km, so it is 180 km away from Town B, heading towards Town A.\n\nThe distance between Town A and Town B is 300 km.\n\nSo, the position of the first train is 120 km from Town A, and the second train is 180 km from Town B.\n\nTo find the distance between them, we can add the distances they have traveled and subtract from the total distance.\n\nDistance apart = Total distance - (Distance covered by first train + Distance covered by second train)\n\nDistance apart = 300 km - (120 km + 180 km) = 300 km - 300 km = 0 km\n\nYes, this confirms that they have met after 2 hours, so the distance apart is zero.\n\nBut maybe the question has a different interpretation.\n\nPerhaps the trains are not moving towards each other, or there's some other factor.\n\nWait, the problem clearly states that both trains are heading towards each other, so my initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about how far each train is from each other's starting point or something else, but based on the wording, \"how far apart will the trains be after 2 hours?\", the answer should be zero km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the given speeds or the time, but as per the information provided, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the time taken to meet and see if it matches the 2 hours.\n\nTime to meet = Total distance / Relative speed = 300 km / 150 km/h = 2 hours\n\nYes, they meet after 2 hours, so at that point, the distance apart is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the trains are 0 km apart after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
