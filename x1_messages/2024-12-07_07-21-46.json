        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see: there's a box with 3 red balls and 7 blue balls. So total balls in the box are 3 red plus 7 blue, which is 10 balls altogether.\n\nNow, the question is, if you draw two balls without replacement, what's the probability that both are red?\n\nOkay, so without replacement means that once you draw the first ball, you don't put it back into the box before drawing the second ball. That affects the probabilities because the composition of the box changes after the first draw.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability that the first ball drawn is red. Since there are 3 red balls out of 10 total balls, the probability for the first ball being red is 3/10.\n\nNow, given that the first ball was red, there are now 2 red balls left and a total of 9 balls remaining in the box.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is 2/9.\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen\u2014both balls are red\u2014I need to multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event given the first.\n\nSo, it's (3/10) times (2/9).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(3/10) * (2/9) = (3*2)/(10*9) = 6/90.\n\nNow, simplify 6/90:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 6\u00f76 = 1, 90\u00f76=15.\n\nSo, 1/15.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 1/15.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 10 is C(10,2), which is 45.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 3 is C(3,2), which is 3.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/45, which simplifies to 1/15.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1/15.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the positions: first draw and second draw.\n\nProbability first is red: 3/10.\n\nThen, second is red given first was red: 2/9.\n\nMultiply: (3/10)*(2/9)=1/15.\n\nAlternatively, probability first is red and second is red.\n\nOr, I could think of it as probability first is red, and then second is red.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, probability first is red and second is red is 3/10 * 2/9 = 1/15.\n\nAlternatively, probability first is red and second is red is same as combination approach: C(3,2)/C(10,2)=3/45=1/15.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 1/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}} \\]"
