        "content": "Sure! Here's a simple JavaScript function that does exactly that:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sumEvenNumbers(arr) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let num of arr) {\n        if (num % 2 === 0) {\n            sum += num;\n        }\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing an array of integers to it, and it will return the sum of all the even numbers in that array. For example:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(sumEvenNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])); // Output: 12 (2 + 4 + 6)\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each number in the array, checks if it is even (using the modulus operator `%` to see if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0), and if it is, adds it to a running sum. Finally, it returns the sum of all even numbers found in the array."
