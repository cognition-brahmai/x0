        "content": "So the company makes 500 units of product A every day. They sell 60% of what they make each day and store the rest. We need to find out how many units they store after 30 days.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many units they sell each day. If they sell 60% of their daily production, that means they sell 60% of 500 units. To calculate that:\n\n60% of 500 = 0.60 * 500 = 300 units\n\nSo, they sell 300 units each day.\n\nNow, since they produce 500 units each day and sell 300, the rest should be stored. So, the number of units stored each day would be:\n\n500 units (produced) - 300 units (sold) = 200 units (stored)\n\nThat means they store 200 units every day.\n\nNow, to find out how many units they store after 30 days, we just need to multiply the daily storage by the number of days:\n\n200 units/day * 30 days = 6000 units\n\nSo, after 30 days, they would have stored 6000 units of product A.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, instead of calculating the units sold and then subtracting, we could directly calculate the percentage of units that are stored each day.\n\nSince they sell 60% of their production, the remaining 40% should be stored. So, 40% of 500 units is:\n\n40% of 500 = 0.40 * 500 = 200 units\n\nAgain, that matches our earlier calculation that they store 200 units each day.\n\nThen, over 30 days, it's simply 200 units/day * 30 days = 6000 units.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the company was storing the unsold units from previous days as well, but according to the problem, they produce 500 units each day, sell 60% of that day's production, and store the remaining 40%. There's no mention of selling stored units or anything like that.\n\nSo, each day, they produce 500, sell 300, store 200, and this happens every day for 30 days.\n\nTherefore, total stored units after 30 days would be 200 units/day * 30 days = 6000 units.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
