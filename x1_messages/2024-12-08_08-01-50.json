We will achieve this through a series of steps, each involving specific tools to gather and analyze information.\n\n### Execution Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Director of \"Inception\"**\n   - **Tool:** YahooSearch\n   - **Input:** \"Who is the director of the movie Inception?\"\n   - **Purpose:** To find web pages that contain information about the director of \"Inception.\"\n\n2. **Extract the Director's Name**\n   - **Tool:** IntelliAnswer\n   - **Input:** \"Who is the director of Inception? Given context: :info1:\"\n   - **Purpose:** To interpret the search results and pinpoint the name of the director.\n\n3. **Find Other Movies Directed by the Same Director**\n   - **Tool:** YahooSearch\n   - **Input:** \"Movies directed by :info2:\"\n   - **Purpose:** To locate web pages that list other movies directed by the identified director.\n\n4. **Extract Relevant Hyperlinks**\n   - **Tool:** HyperlinkFinder\n   - **Input:** :info3:\n   - **Purpose:** To find hyperlinks from the search results that may lead to more detailed information about the director's filmography.\n\n5. **Read the Contents of the Relevant Webpages**\n   - **Tool:** PageReader\n   - **Input:** :info4:\n   - **Purpose:** To retrieve the text content from the hyperlinks found, which can be analyzed for the list of movies.\n\n6. **Extract the Names of Other Movies Directed**\n   - **Tool:** IntelliAnswer\n   - **Input:** \"What other movies has :info2: directed? Given context: :info5:\"\n   - **Purpose:** To parse the webpage contents and identify the names of other movies directed by the same director.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**\n   - **Output:** :info6:\n   - **Purpose:** To present the list of other movies directed by the director of \"Inception.\"\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for the Director of \"Inception\"**\n   - Use YahooSearch to find information about who directed \"Inception.\"\n   - This will return a set of search results that likely include the director's name.\n\n2. **Interpret Search Results to Find Director's Name**\n   - Use IntelliAnswer to analyze the search results and directly extract the name of the director.\n   - This step ensures that we have the correct director's name to proceed with further searches.\n\n3. **Search for Other Movies Directed by the Same Director**\n   - Use YahooSearch again, this time querying for other movies directed by the identified director.\n   - This will provide a list of web pages that may contain the desired information.\n\n4. **Find Relevant Hyperlinks from Search Results**\n   - Use HyperlinkFinder to extract hyperlinks from the search results.\n   - These hyperlinks are potential sources of detailed information about the director's filmography.\n\n5. **Read the Contents of the Relevant Webpages**\n   - Use PageReader to extract the text content from the hyperlinks found.\n   - This step is crucial for obtaining the raw data that can be analyzed for the list of movies.\n\n6. **Extract the Names of Other Movies Directed**\n   - Use IntelliAnswer to parse the webpage contents and identify other movies directed by the same director.\n   - This step ensures that we accurately extract the required information from the text.\n\n7. **Present the Final Answer**\n   - The final output will be the list of other movies directed by the director of \"Inception,\" as extracted in the previous step.\n\nBy following this plan, we can systematically find and present the required information using the available tools."
