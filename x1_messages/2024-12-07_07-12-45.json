We'll make sure it's efficient and easy to understand.\n\nFirst, we need to consider that the array is unsorted, which means we can't assume any order in the elements. So, we'll have to iterate through the entire array to find the minimum and maximum values.\n\nOne efficient way to do this is to initialize two variables, one for the smallest number and one for the largest number, and set them to the first element of the array. Then, we'll loop through the rest of the array, updating these variables whenever we find a smaller or larger number.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction findMinMax(arr) {\n    if (arr.length === 0) {\n        return { min: null, max: null };\n    }\n\n    let min = arr[0];\n    let max = arr[0];\n\n    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {\n        if (arr[i] < min) {\n            min = arr[i];\n        } else if (arr[i] > max) {\n            max = arr[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    return { min, max };\n}\n```\n\nLet's break down what's happening here:\n\n1. **Check for empty array:** If the array is empty, we return an object with `min` and `max` set to `null` since there are no elements to compare.\n\n2. **Initialize min and max:** We start by assuming the first element is both the smallest and largest.\n\n3. **Iterate through the array:** We loop from the second element to the end of the array. For each element, we check if it's smaller than the current `min` or larger than the current `max`, and update these variables accordingly.\n\n4. **Return the results:** Finally, we return an object containing the `min` and `max` values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only loop through the array once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.\n\nYou can test this function with different arrays to see how it works. For example:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(findMinMax([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5])); // { min: 1, max: 9 }\nconsole.log(findMinMax([-10, 0, 10, 20, -5])); // { min: -10, max: 20 }\nconsole.log(findMinMax([])); // { min: null, max: null }\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation."
