        "content": "Sure! To design this SQL query, we need to consider the structure of the \"Employees\" table. Assuming the table has columns for employee details such as name, department, and join date, we can proceed as follows.\n\nFirst, identify the relevant columns:\n\n- `employee_name` (or similar): The name of the employee.\n\n- `department`: The department the employee belongs to.\n\n- `join_date`: The date when the employee joined the company.\n\nOur goal is to retrieve all employees who joined in the last year and are part of either the 'Sales' or 'Marketing' department.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll use the SELECT statement along with appropriate conditions in the WHERE clause.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the query:\n\n1. **SELECT** the columns you want to retrieve. For this example, let's assume we want the employee's name and department.\n\n2. **FROM** the \"Employees\" table.\n\n3. **WHERE** the department is either 'Sales' or 'Marketing', and the join date is within the last year.\n\nTo calculate the last year's date, we can use SQL functions. The specific function may vary depending on the database system you're using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server). For this example, I'll use MySQL syntax.\n\nIn MySQL, you can use the `CURDATE()` function to get the current date and `INTERVAL 1 YEAR` to subtract one year from it.\n\nSo, the condition for the join date would be:\n\n```sql\njoin_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR\n```\n\nAnd for the department:\n\n```sql\ndepartment IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT employee_name, department\nFROM Employees\nWHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')\nAND join_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR;\n```\n\nThis query will return the names and departments of all employees who joined in the last year and are part of either the 'Sales' or 'Marketing' department.\n\nIf you're using a different database system, the date function might be different. For example, in PostgreSQL, you can use the `CURRENT_DATE` and `INTERVAL` keywords similarly:\n\n```sql\nSELECT employee_name, department\nFROM Employees\nWHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')\nAND join_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';\n```\n\nIn SQL Server, you can use the `DATEADD` function:\n\n```sql\nSELECT employee_name, department\nFROM Employees\nWHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')\nAND join_date >= DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE());\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust the column names and table name according to your actual database schema.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo retrieve all employees who joined in the last year and are part of either the 'Sales' or 'Marketing' department from the \"Employees\" table, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT employee_name, department\nFROM Employees\nWHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')\nAND join_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **SELECT employee_name, department**: Specifies the columns to retrieve, which are the employee's name and department in this case.\n2. **FROM Employees**: Indicates the table from which to retrieve the data.\n3. **WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')**: Filters the records to include only those employees who are in the 'Sales' or 'Marketing' departments.\n4. **AND join_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR**: Ensures that only employees who joined in the last year are included. The `CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR` calculates the date exactly one year before the current date.\n\nThis query is written for MySQL. If you are using a different database system, you may need to adjust the date function accordingly:\n- **PostgreSQL**:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT employee_name, department\n  FROM Employees\n  WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')\n  AND join_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';\n  ```\n- **SQL Server**:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT employee_name, department\n  FROM Employees\n  WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')\n  AND join_date >= DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE());\n  ```\n\nEnsure that the column names match those in your actual database schema."
