        "content": "Let's see. The company has a monthly budget of $50,000. They spend 30% on salaries, 20% on rent, and 10% on utilities. I need to find out how much money is left for other expenses.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much they spend on each of these categories.\n\nStarting with salaries:\n\n30% of $50,000 is calculated as 0.30 \u00d7 50,000 = $15,000.\n\nNext, rent:\n\n20% of $50,000 is 0.20 \u00d7 50,000 = $10,000.\n\nThen, utilities:\n\n10% of $50,000 is 0.10 \u00d7 50,000 = $5,000.\n\nNow, I'll add up these expenses to find the total amount spent on salaries, rent, and utilities.\n\n$15,000 (salaries) + $10,000 (rent) + $5,000 (utilities) = $30,000.\n\nSo, the total expenses for these three categories are $30,000.\n\nNow, to find out how much is left for other expenses, I'll subtract this total from the monthly budget.\n\n$50,000 (monthly budget) - $30,000 (total expenses for salaries, rent, and utilities) = $20,000.\n\nTherefore, $20,000 is left for other expenses.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate this? Maybe by finding the percentage of the budget left after allocating for salaries, rent, and utilities.\n\nLet's see:\n\nSalaries: 30%\n\nRent: 20%\n\nUtilities: 10%\n\nTotal percentage allocated: 30% + 20% + 10% = 60%.\n\nSo, the percentage left for other expenses is 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nNow, 40% of $50,000 is 0.40 \u00d7 50,000 = $20,000.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation. So, $20,000 is indeed the amount left for other expenses.\n\nAlternatively, I could verify this by considering that 60% is allocated, which is $30,000, and the remaining 40% is $20,000.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the budget is divided into these four parts: salaries, rent, utilities, and other expenses.\n\nIf salaries are 30%, rent is 20%, utilities are 10%, then other expenses must be 100% - (30% + 20% + 10%) = 40%.\n\nSo, other expenses are 40% of the budget.\n\nCalculating 40% of $50,000:\n\n0.40 \u00d7 50,000 = $20,000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think this is straightforward. The company has $20,000 left for other expenses after accounting for salaries, rent, and utilities.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nIs there any tax or other deductions that might be applied to the budget? The question doesn't mention anything about taxes or additional expenses, so I'll assume that the budget is straightforward and doesn't include any other deductions.\n\nAlso, the question specifies that these are monthly expenses, so I don't need to consider annual costs or anything like that.\n\nMoreover, the percentages are given as straightforward percentages of the budget, so I don't need to worry about any proportional allocations based on hours or any other metrics.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems straightforward: 40% of the budget is left for other expenses, which amounts to $20,000.\n\nI can also check this by considering that if 30% is $15,000, 20% is $10,000, and 10% is $5,000, then adding these up gives $30,000, and subtracting that from $50,000 indeed leaves $20,000.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each percentage point is equal to $500 (since 1% of $50,000 is $500), then:\n\nSalaries: 30% \u00d7 $500 = $15,000\n\nRent: 20% \u00d7 $500 = $10,000\n\nUtilities: 10% \u00d7 $500 = $5,000\n\nOther expenses: 40% \u00d7 $500 = $20,000\n\nThis again confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nI think I've approached this from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same answer, so I'm confident that $20,000 is the correct amount left for other expenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20000} \\]"
