Below is a Python program that generates a random password with the specified criteria:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(min_length=8, max_length=20):\n    if min_length > max_length:\n        raise ValueError(\"Minimum length cannot be greater than maximum length.\")\n    \n    # Define the character sets\n    uppercase_letters = string.ascii_uppercase\n    lowercase_letters = string.ascii_lowercase\n    digits = string.digits\n    special_chars = string.punctuation\n    \n    # Ensure at least one character from each set is included\n    password = [\n        random.choice(uppercase_letters),\n        random.choice(lowercase_letters),\n        random.choice(digits),\n        random.choice(special_chars)\n    ]\n    \n    # Determine the total length of the password\n    length = random.randint(min_length, max_length)\n    \n    # Fill the remaining characters randomly from all categories\n    all_chars = uppercase_letters + lowercase_letters + digits + special_chars\n    for _ in range(length - 4):\n        password.append(random.choice(all_chars))\n    \n    # Shuffle the password list to avoid predictable patterns\n    random.shuffle(password)\n    \n    # Convert list to string and return\n    return ''.join(password)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    password = generate_password()\n    print(\"Generated Password:\", password)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Character Sets**: The program uses `string.ascii_uppercase`, `string.ascii_lowercase`, `string.digits`, and `string.punctuation` to define the sets of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, respectively.\n  \n2. **Password Length**: The length of the password is randomly chosen between the specified minimum and maximum lengths (8 to 20 characters in this case).\n\n3. **Ensure Complexity**: To ensure the password contains at least one character from each category, the program initially selects one character from each set.\n\n4. **Fill Remaining Characters**: The remaining characters of the password are filled by randomly selecting from all categories.\n\n5. **Shuffle**: The password list is shuffled to eliminate any predictable patterns.\n\n6. **Return Password**: Finally, the list is converted to a string and returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that the generated password is both random and meets the complexity requirements."
