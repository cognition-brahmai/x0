        "content": "Alright, I've got this question: \"Who was the architect behind the design of the Sydney Opera House and what were his other major works?\" Okay, so I need to find out who designed the Sydney Opera House and then also find out about other big projects that this architect worked on.\n\nFirst things first, I need to know who the architect is. I'm pretty sure I've heard about this before, but to be accurate, I should look it up. I can use DuckDuckGo for this because it's a good search engine and maybe I can find reliable sources that way.\n\nSo, my first plan is to search for \"architect of Sydney Opera House\" using DuckDuckGo. That should give me a list of websites that talk about who designed it. I can look at the top results and see what they say. Probably, the architect's name will be J\u00f8rn Utzon, but I should confirm that.\n\nOnce I have the architect's name, I need to find out about his other major works. So, maybe I can take the results from the first search and see if any of them list other projects by this architect. If not, I can do another search, like \"J\u00f8rn Utzon major works\" or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for a biography of J\u00f8rn Utzon or a page that's dedicated to his architectural career. That might have a list of his notable projects.\n\nI think the best approach is to first confirm who the architect is using DuckDuckGo, and then use that information to find more about his other works. Maybe I can even find a Wikipedia page or an official website that lists all his projects.\n\nIf I come across multiple sources that list different projects, I should cross-verify them to make sure they're accurate. It's important to provide correct information.\n\nAlso, since the Sydney Opera House is in Australia, but I think J\u00f8rn Utzon was Danish, so his other works might be in Denmark or other parts of the world. So, I should look for information that spans his entire career, not just in one country.\n\nI should also consider that the design of the Sydney Opera House was a big deal and maybe he has some interesting stories or challenges related to that project. Maybe I can find some insights into his design process or why he chose certain elements.\n\nBut for now, the main task is to identify the architect and list his other major works. So, I'll start with searching for the architect's name and then proceed from there.\n\nAlright, let's get started.\n\nPlan: Search for \"architect of Sydney Opera House\" using DuckDuckGo to identify the designer.\n#E1 = DuckDuckGo[\"architect of Sydney Opera House\"]\n\nPlan: Extract the name of the architect from the search results in #E1.\n#E2 = JLM[\"What is the name of the architect behind the Sydney Opera House design, based on the search results from #E1?\"]\n\nPlan: Search for \"J\u00f8rn Utzon major works\" using DuckDuckGo to find other significant projects by the architect.\n#E3 = DuckDuckGo[\"J\u00f8rn Utzon major works\"]\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the search results in #E3.\n#E4 = LinkHarvester[#E3]\n\nPlan: Use WebReader to extract information from the relevant links in #E4.\n#E5 = WebReader[#E4]\n\nPlan: Analyze the extracted information in #E5 to list the major works of J\u00f8rn Utzon.\n#E6 = JLM[\"Based on the information in #E5, list the major works of J\u00f8rn Utzon.\"]\n\nFinal Answer: #E6"
