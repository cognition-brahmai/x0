        "content": "Alright, I have this task to create a Node.js script that connects to an Azure Storage account and uploads a local file to a specified container. The script needs to accept command line arguments for the storage account connection string, the container name, and the local file path. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a Node.js environment. I should make sure that Node.js is installed on my machine. I can check that by running `node -v` in the command line, and it should return the version number if it's installed.\n\nNext, I need to create a new Node.js project. I'll start by creating a new directory for this project and navigating into it via the command line. Then, I'll initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`. I can accept the default settings for now to speed things up.\n\nNow, to interact with Azure Storage, I need to use the Azure Storage SDK for Node.js. I think the package is called `@azure/storage-blob`. I'll need to install that package using npm. So, I'll run `npm install @azure/storage-blob`.\n\nOnce that's installed, I can start writing the script. The script needs to accept command line arguments for the connection string, container name, and local file path. In Node.js, command line arguments can be accessed via the `process.argv` array.\n\nI should note that `process.argv` includes the Node.js executable path and the script path as the first two elements, so the actual arguments start from index 2.\n\nSo, I'll need to parse these arguments accordingly. Maybe I'll expect the arguments in this order: connection string, container name, and local file path.\n\nBut, to make it more user-friendly, perhaps I should use a package like `minimist` or `yargs` to handle command line options more gracefully. For simplicity, I'll stick with `minimist`.\n\nI'll install it using `npm install minimist`.\n\nThen, in my script, I'll require `minimist` and parse the arguments.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```javascript\nconst minimist = require('minimist');\nconst args = minimist(process.argv.slice(2));\n\nconst connectionString = args.connectionString;\nconst containerName = args.containerName;\nconst localFilePath = args.localFilePath;\n```\n\nAnd the user can pass arguments like:\n\n```\nnode upload.js --connectionString=\"<connection string>\" --containerName=\"<container name>\" --localFilePath=\"<file path>\"\n```\n\nThat seems neat.\n\nNow, I need to connect to the Azure Storage account using the connection string. I'll need to import the `BlobServiceClient` from `@azure/storage-blob`.\n\nLike this:\n\n```javascript\nconst { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');\n```\n\nThen, create a `BlobServiceClient` instance using the connection string:\n\n```javascript\nconst blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);\n```\n\nAfter that, I need to get a reference to the specified container. I can use the `getContainerClient` method:\n\n```javascript\nconst containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName);\n```\n\nI should check if the container exists, and if not, create it. I can use the `createIfNotExists` method on the container client.\n\n```javascript\nawait containerClient.createIfNotExists();\n```\n\nOkay, now I need to upload a local file to this container. First, I need to read the local file. I can use the `fs` module for that.\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst fileData = fs.readFileSync(localFilePath);\n```\n\nThen, I need to get a block blob client to upload the file. I'll use the `getBlockBlobClient` method on the container client.\n\n```javascript\nconst blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(path.basename(localFilePath));\n```\n\nHere, I'm using `path.basename` to get just the file name from the local file path, so it's uploaded with its original name.\n\nThen, I can upload the data using the `uploadData` method:\n\n```javascript\nawait blockBlobClient.uploadData(fileData);\n```\n\nI should also handle any errors that might occur during these operations. I can use try-catch blocks for that.\n\nAdditionally, it's a good practice to provide some feedback to the user, like confirming that the upload was successful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the script might look like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst minimist = require('minimist');\nconst { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nasync function main() {\n  const args = minimist(process.argv.slice(2));\n\n  const connectionString = args.connectionString;\n  const containerName = args.containerName;\n  const localFilePath = args.localFilePath;\n\n  if (!connectionString || !containerName || !localFilePath) {\n    console.log('Usage: node upload.js --connectionString=\"<connection string>\" --containerName=\"<container name>\" --localFilePath=\"<file path>\"');\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n\n  const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);\n  const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName);\n\n  try {\n    await containerClient.createIfNotExists();\n    console.log(`Container \"${containerName}\" ensured.`);\n\n    const fileData = fs.readFileSync(localFilePath);\n    const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(path.basename(localFilePath));\n\n    await blockBlobClient.uploadData(fileData);\n    console.log(`File \"${path.basename(localFilePath)}\" uploaded successfully to container \"${containerName}\".`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nI should test this script with a sample file and see if it uploads correctly to Azure Blob Storage.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the connection string has the necessary permissions to create containers and upload blobs.\n\nThat should do it for now. If there are any issues, I'll need to debug them step by step.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a Node.js script that connects to an Azure Storage account and uploads a local file to a specified container, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.\n- An [Azure Storage account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) with a connection string.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nconst minimist = require('minimist');\nconst { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nasync function main() {\n  const args = minimist(process.argv.slice(2));\n\n  const connectionString = args.connectionString;\n  const containerName = args.containerName;\n  const localFilePath = args.localFilePath;\n\n  if (!connectionString || !containerName || !localFilePath) {\n    console.log('Usage: node upload.js --connectionString=\"<connection string>\" --containerName=\"<container name>\" --localFilePath=\"<file path>\"');\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n\n  const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);\n  const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName);\n\n  try {\n    await containerClient.createIfNotExists();\n    console.log(`Container \"${containerName}\" ensured.`);\n\n    const fileData = fs.readFileSync(localFilePath);\n    const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(path.basename(localFilePath));\n\n    await blockBlobClient.uploadData(fileData);\n    console.log(`File \"${path.basename(localFilePath)}\" uploaded successfully to container \"${containerName}\".`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Set Up Your Node.js Project:**\n   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.\n   - Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init -y`.\n\n2. **Install Required Packages:**\n   - Install the Azure Storage Blob package: `npm install @azure/storage-blob`.\n   - Install the minimist package for parsing command-line arguments: `npm install minimist`.\n\n3. **Create the Upload Script:**\n   - Create a new file named `upload.js`.\n   - Copy the provided code into `upload.js`.\n\n4. **Run the Script:**\n   - Use the following command to upload a file:\n     ```sh\n     node upload.js --connectionString=\"<your_connection_string>\" --containerName=\"<your_container_name>\" --localFilePath=\"<path_to_your_file>\"\n     ```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Command-Line Arguments:** The script uses `minimist` to parse command-line arguments for the connection string, container name, and local file path.\n- **Azure Blob Service Client:** Connects to the Azure Storage account using the provided connection string.\n- **Container Management:** Ensures the specified container exists; if not, it creates it.\n- **File Upload:** Reads the local file and uploads it to the specified container in Azure Blob Storage.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to upload files to Azure Blob Storage directly from the command line using Node.js."
