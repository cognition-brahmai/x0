The concept of a \"shooting star\" is actually a meteoroid burning up in the Earth's atmosphere, which creates a bright streak of light in the sky. Since sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space, and the sound produced by a meteoroid entering the atmosphere is often too high-pitched for human ears to hear, it's impossible to know what a shooting star sounds like."
