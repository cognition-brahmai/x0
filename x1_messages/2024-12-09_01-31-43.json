        "content": "So there's this problem here: In a village, there are 20 houses. Each house has at least one cat and no more than four cats. I need to find out the minimum number of cats in the village. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The question is looking for the smallest possible number of cats that can be in the village given those constraints. So, each house must have at least one cat, and no house can have more than four cats.\n\nTo minimize the total number of cats, I should try to assign the smallest possible number of cats to each house, right? Since each house must have at least one cat, the smallest number I can assign to each house is one cat.\n\nSo, if every house has exactly one cat, then the total number of cats would be 20 houses times one cat per house, which equals 20 cats.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that no house can have more than four cats, but it doesn't say that I can't have houses with different numbers of cats. Maybe having some houses with more cats could allow me to have fewer cats overall?\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense. If I have some houses with more than one cat, that would actually increase the total number of cats, not decrease it. For example, if one house has two cats instead of one, then that adds an extra cat to the total.\n\nSo, to minimize the number of cats, I should have each house have exactly one cat, which gives me a total of 20 cats.\n\nIs there any way to have fewer than 20 cats? Well, the problem says that each house has at least one cat, so I can't have any house with zero cats. Therefore, 20 cats is indeed the minimum.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if some houses share cats or something, but the problem states that each house has its own cats, and no more than four per house.\n\nNo, I think the answer is simply 20 cats.\n\nBut let's double-check. Suppose I try to have some houses with fewer cats, but the problem says each house must have at least one cat, so I can't go below one cat per house.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick involving shared ownership or something, but based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the minimum number of cats in the village is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
