        "content": "Let's see. I have a square garden with each side being 10 meters long. So, if I need to put a fence around the entire garden, I need to calculate the total length of fencing required.\n\nFirst, since it's a square, all four sides are equal in length. So, the total perimeter would be 4 times the length of one side. That means:\n\nPerimeter = 4 \u00d7 side length = 4 \u00d7 10 meters = 40 meters\n\nNow, the owner has only enough materials for 36 meters of fencing. So, comparing the required fencing to what's available:\n\nRequired fencing: 40 meters\n\nAvailable fencing: 36 meters\n\n40 meters > 36 meters\n\nSo, 36 meters is less than the required 40 meters. Therefore, with only 36 meters of fencing material, the owner cannot enclose the whole garden.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps the owner can enclose a smaller area within the garden or enclose only a part of the garden. However, the question is specifically about enclosing the entire garden.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the garden isn't perfectly square, or perhaps there are existing fences on some sides. But based on the information provided, we have to assume it's a square garden with no existing fencing.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the owner can use existing structures or walls as part of the enclosure. If some sides of the garden are already fenced or have walls, then they might not need to fence all four sides.\n\nFor example, if one side of the garden is adjacent to a house or has an existing wall, then they only need to fence the remaining three sides.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nIf one side is already fenced, then fencing needed = 3 \u00d7 10 meters = 30 meters\n\nSince 30 meters is less than 36 meters, they could enclose the garden with three sides and use the existing wall for the fourth side.\n\nSimilarly, if two sides have existing fencing or walls, then:\n\nFencing needed = 2 \u00d7 10 meters = 20 meters\n\nAgain, 20 meters is less than 36 meters.\n\nOr, if only two sides are adjacent to walls or have existing fencing, then fencing needed is 20 meters, which is within the 36 meters available.\n\nAlternatively, if only one side has an existing fence, fencing needed is 30 meters, which is still less than 36 meters.\n\nTherefore, depending on the existing structures, the owner might be able to enclose the garden with the available materials.\n\nBut going back to the original scenario where there are no existing fences or walls, then no, 36 meters is not enough to fence all four sides of a 10-meter square garden.\n\nHowever, perhaps the owner can fence three and a half sides, but that wouldn't fully enclose the garden.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the owner can use the fencing material more efficiently by shaping the fence differently, but since the garden is square, fencing it with a different shape might not be practical.\n\nAnother option could be to share fences with neighboring properties, but again, that's speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, with 36 meters of fencing material, the owner cannot fully enclose a square garden with 10-meter sides, as it requires 40 meters of fencing.\n\nUnless there are existing fences or walls on one or more sides, in which case, with 36 meters, they could enclose the garden by fencing the remaining sides.\n\nBut without any existing fencing, it's not possible to fully enclose the garden with only 36 meters of fencing material.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No, the owner cannot enclose the whole garden with only 36 meters of fencing material.}} \\]"
