During his presidency, he led the country through the American Civil War and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in Confederate-held territory. The Gettysburg Address, delivered in 1863, is one of his most well-known speeches and is considered a masterpiece of conciseness and eloquence."
