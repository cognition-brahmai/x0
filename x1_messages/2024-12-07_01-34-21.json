        "content": "So I need to figure out how many different ways there are to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHEMATICS.\" Okay, first things first, I know that if all the letters were unique, the number of arrangements would be the factorial of the number of letters. The word \"MATHEMATICS\" has 11 letters, so if they were all distinct, it would be 11! arrangements. But, in this case, some letters repeat: M appears twice, A appears twice, T appears twice, and the rest are unique.\n\nSo, I recall that when arranging items where some are identical, the formula\u8c03\u6574\u4e3a\u603b\u6392\u5217\u6570\u9664\u4ee5\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91cd\u590d\u5b57\u6bcd\u7684\u9636\u4e58\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\u3002\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u6392\u5217\u6570\u7b49\u4e8e11!\u9664\u4ee5(2! * 2! * 2!)\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aM\u3001A\u548cT\u5404\u81ea\u91cd\u590d\u4e86\u4e24\u6b21\u3002\n\n\u8ba9\u6211\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c11!\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f11 factorial is 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe I can calculate it step by step.\n\n11 \u00d7 10 = 110\n\n110 \u00d7 9 = 990\n\n990 \u00d7 8 = 7920\n\n7920 \u00d7 7 = 55440\n\n55440 \u00d7 6 = 332640\n\n332640 \u00d7 5 = 1,663,200\n\n1,663,200 \u00d7 4 = 6,652,800\n\n6,652,800 \u00d7 3 = 19,958,400\n\n19,958,400 \u00d7 2 = 39,916,800\n\nSo, 11! equals 39,916,800.\n\nNow, since M, A, and T each repeat twice, I need to divide this by 2! for each of them. 2! is 2, so 2! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 2! equals 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 39,916,800 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do that division: 39,916,800 \u00f7 8 = 4,989,600.\n\nSo, there are 4,989,600 different ways to arrange the letters in \"MATHEMATICS.\"\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I have all the repeating letters accounted for correctly. The word \"MATHEMATICS\" has:\n\nM: 2\n\nA: 2\n\nT: 2\n\nAnd the other letters\u2014H, E, I, C, S\u2014are each unique.\n\nYes, so the formula should indeed be 11! divided by (2! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 2!), which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of choosing positions for each letter, first I would choose 2 positions out of 11 for M's, then 2 out of the remaining 9 for A's, then 2 out of the remaining 7 for T's, and then arrange the remaining 5 unique letters in the remaining 5 positions.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nC(11,2) for M's \u00d7 C(9,2) for A's \u00d7 C(7,2) for T's \u00d7 5! for the remaining letters.\n\nLet me calculate that to verify.\n\nC(11,2) = 55\n\nC(9,2) = 36\n\nC(7,2) = 21\n\n5! = 120\n\nSo, 55 \u00d7 36 = 1,980\n\n1,980 \u00d7 21 = 41,580\n\n41,580 \u00d7 120 = 4,989,600\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation of 4,989,600.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to use the multinomial coefficient:\n\n11! / (2! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 1! \u00d7 1! \u00d7 1! \u00d7 1! \u00d7 1!) where the denominators account for the frequencies of M, A, T, H, E, I, C, S respectively.\n\nAgain, that simplifies to 11! / (2! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 2!) since the other factors are 1! which is 1.\n\nSo, again, that confirms the answer is 4,989,600.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in \"MATHEMATICS\" is 4,989,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4989600} \\]"
