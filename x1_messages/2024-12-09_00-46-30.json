        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to implement a Java program that generates random mazes using Prim's algorithm and displays them in ASCII format. The program should also let users specify the dimensions of the maze. I need to make sure I understand Prim's algorithm and how to apply it to maze generation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how Prim's algorithm works. Prim's algorithm is typically used to find the minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph, but it can also be used to generate mazes. In the context of maze generation, we can think of the maze as a grid where each cell is a node in the graph, and the walls between cells are edges.\n\nHere's a general outline of how Prim's algorithm can be used for maze generation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a grid where all cells are considered \"walls\" or unvisited. Choose a starting cell and mark it as visited.\n\n2. **Frontier Management**: maintain a list of edges (in this case, potential passages between cells) that connect visited cells to unvisited cells.\n\n3. **Edge Selection**: randomly select an edge from the frontier list, remove the wall between the two cells, and mark the unvisited cell as visited. Add new edges to the frontier list that connect the new visited cell to its unvisited neighbors.\n\n4. **Repeat**: continue selecting edges from the frontier list and expanding the maze until no more edges are left in the frontier list.\n\nFor the ASCII display, I'll need to represent the maze in a way that shows walls and passages. Common characters used are:\n\n- `#` for walls\n\n- ` ` (space) for passages\n\nI also need to handle user input for specifying the dimensions of the maze. In Java, I can use the `Scanner` class to read user input.\n\nLet me start by planning the structure of the program:\n\n- **Maze Class**: responsible for generating the maze using Prim's algorithm and storing the maze data.\n\n- **MazeGenerator Class**: contains the main method to handle user input and display the maze.\n\nI need to decide how to represent the maze internally. A 2D array seems appropriate, where each element represents a cell in the grid. Each cell can be marked as visited or not, and I can keep track of which walls are present.\n\nIn Prim's algorithm, the frontier list can be implemented using a `List` or a `Set`. Since the order doesn't matter, a `List` should suffice.\n\nI should also consider how to handle the grid coordinates. I'll use row and column indices, starting from (0,0) in the top-left corner.\n\nLet me think about the steps in more detail:\n\n1. **User Input**: Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for the maze.\n\n2. **Initialize Maze**: Create a 2D array to represent the maze, initialized with walls.\n\n3. **Choose Starting Cell**: Select a random cell as the starting point and mark it as visited.\n\n4. **Build Frontier List**: Initialize a list with the edges of the starting cell that border unvisited cells.\n\n5. **Maze Generation Loop**:\n\na. While the frontier list is not empty:\n\ni. Randomly select an edge from the frontier list.\n\nii. If the adjacent cell is unvisited:\n\n- Remove the wall between the current cell and the adjacent cell.\n\n- Mark the adjacent cell as visited.\n\n- Add the edges of the adjacent cell that border unvisited cells to the frontier list.\n\niii. Remove the selected edge from the frontier list.\n\n6. **Display Maze**: Print the maze in ASCII format.\n\nI need to handle edge cases, such as when the maze has only one cell, or when the dimensions are very small.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the maze is fully connected, meaning there are no isolated sections. Prim's algorithm guarantees a perfect maze with no loops and a single path between any two cells.\n\nNow, let's consider how to represent walls in the grid. One common approach is to use a grid where each cell has four walls (north, south, east, west), and as the algorithm progresses, walls are removed to create passages.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a simpler representation where each cell is either a wall or a passage, and passages are connected horizontally and vertically.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll use the latter approach, where each cell is either a wall (`#`) or a passage (` `), and passages are connected by removing the walls between them.\n\nIn this representation, I need to ensure that when I remove a wall between two cells, both cells are marked as passages.\n\nWait, actually, in this representation, all passages are connected through adjacent passage cells, so I need to make sure that when I connect two cells, I set both to be passages and remove the wall between them.\n\nBut in the simple character representation, I need to decide how to draw the walls.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a more sophisticated ASCII representation where horizontal and vertical walls are drawn explicitly.\n\nFor example, using characters like `#`, `-`, and `|` to represent walls and passages.\n\nThis would make the maze look more realistic.\n\nSo, perhaps I should use a representation where:\n\n- `#` represents a wall\n\n- ` ` represents a passage\n\n- `-` represents a horizontal wall\n\n- `|` represents a vertical wall\n\nBut I need to think carefully about how to manage the walls between cells.\n\nMaybe I should consider each cell to have walls on its north, south, east, and west sides, and keep track of which walls are present.\n\nThen, when I connect two cells, I remove the shared wall between them.\n\nThis seems like a better approach.\n\nSo, in code, I can represent the maze as a grid of cells, where each cell has four boolean flags indicating the presence of walls (north, south, east, west).\n\nInitially, all walls are present.\n\nAs I apply Prim's algorithm, I'll remove walls between adjacent cells when I connect them.\n\nFinally, I'll iterate through the grid and print the maze using ASCII characters.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Java.\n\nFirst, I'll need a `Cell` class to represent each cell in the grid, containing four boolean variables for the walls.\n\nThen, the maze will be a 2D array of `Cell` objects.\n\nI'll need methods to:\n\n- Initialize the maze with all walls present.\n\n- Select a random starting cell.\n\n- Build the frontier list with initial edges.\n\n- Select a random edge from the frontier list.\n\n- Remove the wall between two adjacent cells.\n\n- Mark a cell as visited.\n\n- Add new edges to the frontier list when a new cell is visited.\n\n- Display the maze in ASCII format.\n\nAdditionally, I need to handle the grid coordinates correctly, ensuring that I don't go out of bounds when accessing neighboring cells.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan for the `Maze` class:\n\n- **Attributes**:\n\n- `int rows`, `int cols`: dimensions of the maze.\n\n- `Cell[][] grid`: 2D array of `Cell` objects.\n\n- `List<Edge>` frontier: list of edges in the frontier.\n\n- **Methods**:\n\n- `initialize()`: create the grid with all walls present.\n\n- `chooseStartingCell()`: select a random cell as the starting point.\n\n- `buildFrontier(Cell current)`: add edges of the current cell to the frontier list.\n\n- `generateMaze()`: implement Prim's algorithm to generate the maze.\n\n- `displayMaze()`: print the maze in ASCII format.\n\nI also need to define a `Cell` class:\n\n- **Attributes**:\n\n- `boolean northWall`, `boolean eastWall`, `boolean southWall`, `boolean westWall`.\n\n- **Methods**:\n\n- Constructors and getters/setters.\n\nAnd an `Edge` class to represent the edges in the frontier list:\n\n- **Attributes**:\n\n- `Cell cell`: the visited cell.\n\n- `Direction direction`: enum representing the direction (N, S, E, W).\n\n- **Methods**:\n\n- Constructors and getters.\n\nI should also define a `Direction` enum for clarity.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the `generateMaze` method using Prim's algorithm.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\n```java\n\npublic void generateMaze() {\n\n    // Initialize all cells as unvisited\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n\n        for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n\n            grid[r][c] = new Cell(true, true, true, true); // All walls present\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Choose a random starting cell\n\n    Cell current = chooseStartingCell();\n\n    current.setVisited(true);\n\n    // Build initial frontier\n\n    buildFrontier(current);\n\n    // Maze generation loop\n\n    while (!frontier.isEmpty()) {\n\n        // Randomly select an edge from the frontier\n\n        int index = random.nextInt(frontier.size());\n\n        Edge edge = frontier.remove(index);\n\n        Cell next = getNeighbor(edge.getCell(), edge.getDirection());\n\n        if (!next.isVisited()) {\n\n            // Remove the wall between current and next\n\n            removeWall(edge.getCell(), next, edge.getDirection());\n\n            // Mark next cell as visited\n\n            next.setVisited(true);\n\n            // Add new edges to the frontier\n\n            buildFrontier(next);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI need to implement `chooseStartingCell`, `buildFrontier`, `getNeighbor`, `removeWall`, and `displayMaze` methods.\n\nIn `buildFrontier`, I need to add edges that connect the current cell to its unvisited neighbors.\n\nIn `getNeighbor`, I need to return the neighbor cell in the specified direction, if it exists.\n\nIn `removeWall`, I need to remove the wall between two adjacent cells.\n\nIn `displayMaze`, I need to iterate through the grid and print the walls and passages accordingly.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, for the `displayMaze` method, I need to print the maze in ASCII format, showing the walls and passages.\n\nI need to decide on a character set for the walls and passages.\n\nOne common approach is to use:\n\n- `#` for walls\n\n- ` ` (space) for passages\n\nBut to make it more visually appealing, I can use characters like `-` for horizontal walls and `|` for vertical walls.\n\nSo, for each cell, I need to print its north wall, then its west wall, and so on.\n\nI need to think about how to iterate through the grid and print the walls correctly.\n\nPerhaps I can iterate through each row and column and print the north walls first, then the west walls, the cell interior, and the east walls, and finally the south walls.\n\nThis might get a bit complicated, but it's doable.\n\nAlternatively, I can find a library that can help with ASCII maze rendering, but for this task, I should implement it myself.\n\nNow, regarding user input, I'll use the `Scanner` class to read the number of rows and columns from the user.\n\nI need to handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values or negative numbers.\n\nI should add input validation to ensure that the dimensions are positive integers.\n\nOnce I have the dimensions, I can create a `Maze` object with those dimensions and generate the maze.\n\nFinally, I'll display the maze on the console.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the `MazeGenerator` class:\n\n- **Main Method**:\n\n- Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns.\n\n- Read the input using `Scanner`.\n\n- Validate the input to ensure they are positive integers.\n\n- Create a `Maze` object with the specified dimensions.\n\n- Generate the maze using Prim's algorithm.\n\n- Display the maze in ASCII format.\n\nI should also consider adding some error messages if the user enters invalid input.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the `Cell` class.\n\nEach cell has four walls: north, south, east, and west.\n\nI'll represent each wall as a boolean variable.\n\nI'll also need a way to mark a cell as visited.\n\nSo, the `Cell` class will have:\n\n- boolean northWall, southWall, eastWall, westWall\n\n- boolean visited\n\n- Methods to set and get these properties\n\nSimilarly, the `Edge` class will represent an edge in the frontier list, consisting of a cell and a direction.\n\nI'll define a `Direction` enum with values N, S, E, W.\n\nThen, the `Edge` class will have:\n\n- Cell cell\n\n- Direction direction\n\n- Getters for cell and direction\n\nNow, I need to implement the `buildFrontier` method, which adds edges to the frontier list for a given cell.\n\nI need to check each direction and if the neighbor in that direction is unvisited, add an edge for that direction.\n\nSimilarly, in the `removeWall` method, I need to remove the wall between two adjacent cells based on the direction.\n\nFor example, if I'm removing the north wall of the current cell, which is the same as the south wall of the cell to the north.\n\nI need to make sure that when I remove a wall, I update both cells involved.\n\nThis requires careful handling of the directions and grid indices.\n\nI should write helper methods to get neighboring cells based on a direction.\n\nFor example, `getNorthNeighbor(row, col)`, `getEastNeighbor(row, col)`, etc.\n\nBut to make it more efficient, I'll implement a generic `getNeighbor(row, col, direction)` method.\n\nI need to ensure that I don't go out of bounds when accessing neighbors.\n\nNow, let's consider how to represent the maze in ASCII.\n\nI need to print the maze cell by cell, taking into account the walls of each cell.\n\nOne way to do this is to iterate through each row of the grid and, for each cell, print its walls.\n\nFor example, for each cell, print its north wall, then its west wall, the passage interior, and its east wall.\n\nThen, after printing all cells in a row, print the south walls.\n\nThis might be a bit tricky to get right, but with careful planning, it should work.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the maze as a grid of characters, where each cell is represented by multiple characters for walls and passages.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the maze as a grid of cell intersections, where each intersection has connections to north, south, east, and west.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll stick with printing the walls for each cell individually.\n\nNow, I need to map the wall statuses of each cell to ASCII characters.\n\nFor example, for each cell, I can decide which walls to print based on the boolean flags.\n\nI need to make sure that walls are only printed if they are present and not overwritten by adjacent cells.\n\nThis requires careful coordination when printing adjacent cells.\n\nMaybe I can collect all the wall segments in a string and then print them row by row.\n\nLet me try to sketch a small example.\n\nSuppose I have a 2x2 maze:\n\n- Cell (0,0): north wall, east wall, south wall, west wall\n\n- Cell (0,1): north wall, south wall, west wall, no east wall\n\n- Cell (1,0): north wall, east wall, south wall, west wall\n\n- Cell (1,1): north wall, south wall, west wall, no east wall\n\nIn ASCII, it should look like:\n\n```\n\n#+#+#\n\n| | |\n\n#+#+#\n\n| | |\n\n#+#+#\n\n```\n\nWait, actually, in a more standard representation, it would be:\n\n```\n\n#+#+#\n\n| | |\n\n#+#+#\n\n| | |\n\n#+#+#\n\n```\n\nEach cell is represented by its walls, and passages are represented by spaces between walls.\n\nSo, for each row of cells, I need to print the north walls, then the west walls and passages, and then the east walls.\n\nThen, repeat for each row.\n\nI need to handle the borders correctly.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nI can create strings for the north walls, the vertical walls and passages, and assemble them row by row.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in code.\n\nI'll need to iterate through each row and column of the grid and construct the corresponding ASCII representation.\n\nI should write a method in the `Maze` class, say `displayMaze`, which builds and prints the ASCII representation.\n\nI need to make sure that the maze is displayed correctly, with all walls and passages in their proper places.\n\nThis might involve some string manipulation and careful indexing.\n\nNow, let's think about how to handle user input for the maze dimensions.\n\nIn the `MazeGenerator` class, I'll use the `Scanner` class to read integers for the number of rows and columns.\n\nI need to handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values or negative numbers.\n\nI should prompt the user again until valid positive integers are entered.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, I can assume that the user enters valid positive integers and handle only those cases.\n\nBut to make the program more robust, I should add some input validation.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure:\n\n- **MazeGenerator class**:\n\n- main method\n\n- Prompt user for rows and columns\n\n- Read input using Scanner\n\n- Validate input\n\n- Create Maze object with specified dimensions\n\n- Generate maze using Prim's algorithm\n\n- Display the maze\n\n- **Maze class**:\n\n- Attributes: rows, cols, grid (2D array of Cell), frontier (List of Edge)\n\n- Methods:\n\n- initialize(): set all walls to true\n\n- chooseStartingCell(): return a random cell\n\n- buildFrontier(Cell current): add edges to frontier for unvisited neighbors\n\n- generateMaze(): implement Prim's algorithm\n\n- displayMaze(): print the maze in ASCII format\n\n- getNeighbor(Cell current, Direction direction): return the neighbor cell\n\n- removeWall(Cell current, Cell next, Direction direction): remove the shared wall\n\n- **Cell class**:\n\n- Attributes: northWall, southWall, eastWall, westWall, visited\n\n- Methods: getters and setters\n\n- **Edge class**:\n\n- Attributes: cell, direction\n\n- Methods: getters\n\n- **Direction enum**:\n\n- N, S, E, W\n\nI need to ensure that all classes are properly imported and that the code is structured cleanly.\n\nNow, I'll start implementing the classes one by one, beginning with the `Direction` enum, followed by the `Cell` class, then the `Edge` class, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that each class and method has a clear purpose and that the code is well-commented for readability.\n\nGiven the complexity of the task, I should test each component as I implement it to catch any errors early.\n\nFor example, I can test the `getNeighbor` method to ensure it correctly returns adjacent cells without going out of bounds.\n\nSimilarly, I can test the `removeWall` method to ensure that walls are removed appropriately between connected cells.\n\nOnce all components are implemented and tested individually, I can integrate them into the `Maze` class and then into the `MazeGenerator` class.\n\nFinally, I'll run the program to generate and display mazes of different sizes to verify that everything works as expected.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as mazes with only one row or one column, or mazes with very small dimensions.\n\nEnsure that the program handles these cases correctly without errors.\n\nAlright, that's a comprehensive plan for implementing the maze generator using Prim's algorithm in Java. Now, I'll proceed to implement each part step by step.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement a Java program that generates random mazes using Prim's algorithm and displays them in ASCII format, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n1. **User Input**: Allow users to specify the dimensions of the maze.\n2. **Maze Generation**:\n   - Use Prim's algorithm to generate a perfect maze (no loops, exactly one path between any two points).\n   - Represent the maze as a grid of cells, each with walls on their north, south, east, and west sides.\n3. **Display**:\n   - Print the maze in ASCII format using characters for walls and passages.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nenum Direction {\n    N, S, E, W\n}\n\nclass Cell {\n    boolean northWall, southWall, eastWall, westWall;\n    boolean visited;\n\n    Cell(boolean north, boolean south, boolean east, boolean west) {\n        this.northWall = north;\n        this.southWall = south;\n        this.eastWall = east;\n        this.westWall = west;\n        this.visited = false;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Edge {\n    Cell cell;\n    Direction direction;\n\n    Edge(Cell cell, Direction direction) {\n        this.cell = cell;\n        this.direction = direction;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Maze {\n    private int rows, cols;\n    private Cell[][] grid;\n    private List<Edge> frontier;\n    private Random random = new Random();\n\n    Maze(int rows, int cols) {\n        this.rows = rows;\n        this.cols = cols;\n        this.grid = new Cell[rows][cols];\n        this.frontier = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    private void initialize() {\n        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                grid[r][c] = new Cell(true, true, true, true);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private Cell chooseStartingCell() {\n        int r = random.nextInt(rows);\n        int c = random.nextInt(cols);\n        return grid[r][c];\n    }\n\n    private void buildFrontier(Cell current) {\n        for (Direction d : Direction.values()) {\n            Cell neighbor = getNeighbor(current, d);\n            if (neighbor != null && !neighbor.visited) {\n                frontier.add(new Edge(current, d));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private Cell getNeighbor(Cell cell, Direction direction) {\n        int r = Arrays.asList(grid).indexOf(Arrays.asList(grid).stream().flatMap(arr -> Arrays.stream(arr)).collect(Collectors.toList()));\n        int c = Arrays.asList(grid[r]).indexOf(cell);\n        switch (direction) {\n            case N:\n                return (r > 0) ?
