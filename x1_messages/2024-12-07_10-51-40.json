He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. It's interesting to note that many people assume he won the Nobel Prize for his work on relativity, but that's not the case. His work on the photoelectric effect was what earned him the prestigious award. Additionally, despite his immense contributions to science, Einstein faced some challenges in his early life, including speech difficulties during childhood."
