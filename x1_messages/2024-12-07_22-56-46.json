        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 widgets per hour, and each widget has an 8% failure rate in quality control. I need to find out how many good-quality widgets can be expected after 10 hours of production.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are produced in total over 10 hours. That should be straightforward: 500 widgets per hour times 10 hours.\n\nTotal widgets = 500 widgets/hour * 10 hours = 5000 widgets\n\nNow, out of these 5000 widgets, each has an 8% chance of failing quality control. So, the failure rate is 8%, which means that 8% of the widgets are expected to be defective.\n\nTo find the number of defective widgets, I can calculate 8% of 5000.\n\nDefective widgets = 8% of 5000 = 0.08 * 5000 = 400 widgets\n\nSo, if there are 400 defective widgets, the number of good-quality widgets would be the total widgets minus the defective ones.\n\nGood widgets = Total widgets - Defective widgets = 5000 - 400 = 4600 widgets\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of good widgets and then find the number based on that.\n\nIf the failure rate is 8%, then the success rate, or the rate of good widgets, should be 100% - 8% = 92%.\n\nSo, the number of good widgets can also be calculated as 92% of the total widgets.\n\nGood widgets = 92% of 5000 = 0.92 * 5000 = 4600 widgets\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, it looks like 4600 good-quality widgets can be expected after 10 hours of production.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, does the quality control process affect the production rate? The problem says that each widget is subjected to quality control with an 8% failure rate, but it doesn't suggest that failed widgets are reworked or removed from the production line immediately. It seems like the failure rate just indicates which widgets are defective, and we're to find the number of good ones after production.\n\nAlso, the production rate is constant at 500 widgets per hour for 10 hours, so no issues there.\n\nMoreover, the failure rate is given as a percentage, and it's applied uniformly to each widget, so I can use that percentage to find the expected number of defective widgets.\n\nI think that's all straightforward. So, the expected number of good-quality widgets after 10 hours is 4600.\n\nWait, but in probability, when we talk about expected value, it's the long-run average result if an experiment is repeated many times. In this case, the experiment is producing a widget, and there's an 8% chance it's defective. So, for 5000 widgets, the expected number of defective widgets is indeed 400, and good widgets are 4600.\n\nHowever, in reality, the actual number of defective widgets could vary due to randomness, but the expected value is 400.\n\nBut since the question asks for the expected number of good-quality widgets, 4600 is the answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a smaller scale. Suppose the factory produces only 100 widgets.\n\nDefective widgets = 8% of 100 = 8 widgets\n\nGood widgets = 100 - 8 = 92 widgets\n\nAlternatively, good widgets = 92% of 100 = 92 widgets\n\nSame result.\n\nScaling up to 5000 widgets:\n\nDefective widgets = 8% of 5000 = 400 widgets\n\nGood widgets = 5000 - 400 = 4600 widgets\n\nOr good widgets = 92% of 5000 = 4600 widgets\n\nConsistent in both methods.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4600 good-quality widgets expected after 10 hours of production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4600} \\]"
