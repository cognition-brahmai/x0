        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units per day and sells each unit for $10. That means the total revenue per day is 500 units times $10 per unit, which is $5,000. Now, the factory has fixed costs of $2,000 per day, and variable costs of $4 per unit produced. So, the total variable costs would be 500 units times $4 per unit, which is $2,000. To find the daily profit, we need to subtract both the fixed costs and the variable costs from the total revenue. So, profit equals total revenue minus total costs, where total costs are the sum of fixed costs and variable costs. Let me calculate that.\n\nTotal revenue = 500 units * $10/unit = $5,000\n\nTotal variable costs = 500 units * $4/unit = $2,000\n\nTotal costs = fixed costs + variable costs = $2,000 + $2,000 = $4,000\n\nProfit = total revenue - total costs = $5,000 - $4,000 = $1,000\n\nSo, the daily profit of the factory is $1,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Sometimes in economics, they talk about contribution margin or other concepts. The contribution margin per unit is the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit. So, in this case, it would be $10 - $4 = $6 per unit. Then, the total contribution margin would be $6 per unit times 500 units, which is $3,000. Then, profit would be the total contribution margin minus fixed costs, which is $3,000 - $2,000 = $1,000. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of break-even analysis. The break-even point is where total revenue equals total costs, so profit is zero. The break-even point in units is fixed costs divided by the contribution margin per unit. So, $2,000 / $6 per unit = about 333.33 units. Since the factory is producing 500 units, which is more than the break-even point, they should be making a profit. The profit should be the number of units above break-even times the contribution margin per unit. So, (500 - 333.33) units * $6/unit. Let's calculate that:\n\n500 - 333.33 = 166.67 units\n\n166.67 units * $6/unit = $1,000. Again, that matches my earlier profit calculation.\n\nSo, no matter which way I look at it, the daily profit seems to be $1,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other costs or factors that might affect profit. The problem mentions fixed costs of $2,000 per day and variable costs of $4 per unit. It doesn't mention any other costs like taxes, overhead, etc., so I'll assume that's all the cost information we need.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the factory is selling all 500 units it produces each day at $10 per unit. If there were any unsold units, that would affect the revenue, but according to the problem, it seems all units are sold.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory is operating at full capacity or not, but since the problem doesn't specify the capacity, I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nSometimes, economies of scale or other factors might affect costs in the long run, but since the problem is focusing on daily operations, I think the given data is sufficient.\n\nSo, to sum it up, with a revenue of $5,000, total costs of $4,000 (fixed plus variable), the daily profit is $1,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
