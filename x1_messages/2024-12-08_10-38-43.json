The car travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, distance equals speed multiplied by time:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nNext, for the second part of the trip, the car travels at 40 miles per hour for 2 hours:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 40 mph * 2 hours = 80 miles\n\nNow, let's add both distances to find the total distance:\n\nTotal distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 180 miles + 80 miles = 260 miles\n\nNow, let's find the total time taken:\n\nTotal time = 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours\n\nFinally, the average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time = 260 miles / 5 hours = 52 mph\n\nSo, the car's average speed for the entire trip is 52 miles per hour."
