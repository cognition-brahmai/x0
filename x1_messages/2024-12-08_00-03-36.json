        "content": "So there are 120,000 registered voters in this city, and only 60% of them are going to vote in the upcoming election. I need to find out how many people won't vote. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many people actually are voting. If 60% of 120,000 vote, then the number of voters would be 60% of 120,000. To calculate that, I can multiply 120,000 by 0.60.\n\nSo, 120,000 times 0.60 equals... let's see, 120,000 times 0.60 is 72,000. So, 72,000 people are voting.\n\nNow, to find out how many are not voting, I need to subtract the number of voters from the total number of registered voters. That would be 120,000 minus 72,000.\n\n120,000 minus 72,000 equals 48,000.\n\nSo, 48,000 people will not vote.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of people who aren't voting. If 60% are voting, then 40% are not voting, right? Because 100% minus 60% is 40%.\n\nSo, if I calculate 40% of 120,000, that should also give me the number of people who aren't voting.\n\nLet's try that. 40% of 120,000 is 0.40 times 120,000.\n\n0.40 times 120,000 equals 48,000.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nMaybe I can double-check this again with another method. If I know that 60% vote, and 40% don't, and the total is 120,000, then the number who don't vote should indeed be 40% of 120,000, which is 48,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation. Let\u2019s say total voters are V, and non-voters are N. Then V + N = 120,000.\n\nGiven that V = 0.60 * 120,000 = 72,000.\n\nSo, N = 120,000 - 72,000 = 48,000.\n\nOr, N = 0.40 * 120,000 = 48,000.\n\nEither way, I end up with 48,000 people not voting.\n\nI think that makes sense. It's a straightforward percentage problem.\n\nJust to be thorough, percents can sometimes be tricky, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is 48,000 people will not vote.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48000} \\]"
