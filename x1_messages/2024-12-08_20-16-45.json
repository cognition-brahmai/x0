The expression we have is:\n\n8 / (2 * (3 - 1)) + 4^2\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n3 - 1 = 2\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n8 / (2 * 2) + 4^2\n\nNext, handle the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n2 * 2 = 4\n\nSo now it's:\n\n8 / 4 + 4^2\n\nNow, exponents:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nSo the expression is now:\n\n8 / 4 + 16\n\nThen, division and multiplication from left to right:\n\n8 / 4 = 2\n\nSo now it's:\n\n2 + 16\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n2 + 16 = 18\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
