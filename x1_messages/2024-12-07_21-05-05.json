        "content": "Let's see. The train is going from City A to City B, which are 180 miles apart, and it's traveling at a constant speed of 60 mph. It leaves City A at 3 PM, and there's a one-hour time difference between the cities, with City B being ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how long the journey will take. Since speed is 60 miles per hour and the distance is 180 miles, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time = 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours.\n\nSo, the train will take 3 hours to reach City B.\n\nNow, it leaves at 3 PM. Adding 3 hours to that, it should arrive at 6 PM, right?\n\nBut wait, there's a time difference. City B is one hour ahead of City A.\n\nSo, if it's 3 PM in City A, it's 4 PM in City B.\n\nSo, the train departs when it's 4 PM in City B.\n\nThe journey takes 3 hours, so adding that to 4 PM City B time would make it 7 PM in City B when the train arrives.\n\nWait, but the train left City A at 3 PM its time, which is 4 PM City B time, and travels for 3 hours, so it should arrive at 7 PM City B time.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst, convert the departure time to City B's time. City A time is 3 PM, City B is one hour ahead, so 3 PM + 1 hour = 4 PM in City B when the train leaves.\n\nThen, the train travels for 3 hours. So, 4 PM + 3 hours = 7 PM City B time.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the time difference after calculating the arrival time in City A's time.\n\nSo, the train leaves at 3 PM City A time, arrives at 6 PM City A time.\n\nBut since City B is one hour ahead, 6 PM City A time is 7 PM City B time.\n\nEither way, it seems the arrival time is 7 PM in City B.\n\nSo, the answer should be 7 PM City B time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
