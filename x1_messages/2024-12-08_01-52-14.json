This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically in a region called the thylakoid membrane. The light-dependent reactions occur in this membrane, while the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts. The end products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen.\"\n\nBased on the paragraph, where do the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis occur?\nA. In the thylakoid membrane\nB. In the mitochondria\nC. In the stroma of the chloroplasts\nD. In the nucleus"
