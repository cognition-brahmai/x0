        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of 16 friends who went out for dinner. Each person either had pizza or pasta as their main course. Some of them also ordered dessert. The problem gives us some specific information about who ordered dessert based on their main course choice.\n\nFirst, exactly half of those who ordered pizza also ordered dessert. That means if x people ordered pizza, then (1/2)x ordered dessert.\n\nSecond, three-quarters of those who ordered pasta ordered dessert. So, if y people ordered pasta, then (3/4)y ordered dessert.\n\nWe also know that the total number of people is 16, so x + y = 16.\n\nAdditionally, we're told that 12 people ordered dessert. Therefore, the number of people who ordered dessert from pizza plus the number who ordered dessert from pasta should equal 12. In other words, (1/2)x + (3/4)y = 12.\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. x + y = 16\n\n2. (1/2)x + (3/4)y = 12\n\nWe need to solve for x and y.\n\nFirst, let's solve equation 1 for one of the variables. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 16 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into equation 2:\n\n(1/2)x + (3/4)(16 - x) = 12\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n(1/2)x + (3/4)*16 - (3/4)x = 12\n\n(1/2)x + 12 - (3/4)x = 12\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n(1/2)x - (3/4)x + 12 = 12\n\nTo combine (1/2)x and -(3/4)x, let's find a common denominator, which is 4:\n\n(2/4)x - (3/4)x + 12 = 12\n\n(-1/4)x + 12 = 12\n\nNow, subtract 12 from both sides:\n\n(-1/4)x = 0\n\nNow, multiply both sides by -4:\n\nx = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. If x = 0, that means no one ordered pizza, but let's check if this makes sense with the other equations.\n\nIf x = 0, then y = 16 - 0 = 16.\n\nNow, check the dessert orders:\n\n(1/2)*0 + (3/4)*16 = 0 + 12 = 12, which matches the given total of 12 people ordering dessert.\n\nSo, technically, x = 0 is a solution, meaning no one ordered pizza; all 16 ordered pasta, and three-quarters of them (12 people) ordered dessert.\n\nBut is there another possible solution? Let's check if x could be higher.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I assumed x = 0 is the only solution, but maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me revisit the equations.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y = 16\n\n(1/2)x + (3/4)y = 12\n\nLet me try to express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute:\n\ny = 16 - x\n\nNow plug into the second equation:\n\n(1/2)x + (3/4)(16 - x) = 12\n\n(1/2)x + 12 - (3/4)x = 12\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n12 + (1/2)x - (3/4)x = 12\n\n12 - (1/4)x = 12  (since (1/2)x - (3/4)x = - (1/4)x)\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n- (1/4)x = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -4:\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, indeed, x = 0 is the only solution from this equation.\n\nBut let's think about it logically. If x = 0, meaning no one ordered pizza, and all 16 ordered pasta, then (3/4)*16 = 12 ordered dessert, which matches the given information.\n\nIs there a way that some people ordered pizza and still have only 12 ordering dessert?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose some people ordered pizza. Let\u2019s say x people ordered pizza, and y = 16 - x ordered pasta.\n\nThen, (1/2)x + (3/4)(16 - x) = 12\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if x = 4:\n\n(1/2)*4 + (3/4)*(12) = 2 + 9 = 11, which is less than 12.\n\nNot enough people ordering dessert.\n\nIf x = 8:\n\n(1/2)*8 + (3/4)*(8) = 4 + 6 = 10, still less than 12.\n\nx = 12:\n\n(1/2)*12 + (3/4)*(4) = 6 + 3 = 9, still less.\n\nx = 2:\n\n(1/2)*2 + (3/4)*(14) = 1 + 10.5, but since we can't have half people, maybe x = 4 is better.\n\nWait, earlier with x = 4, we got 11, which is still less than 12.\n\nx = 0 gives exactly 12.\n\nSo, it seems that x = 0 is the only solution that satisfies both equations.\n\nTherefore, no one ordered pizza; all 16 ordered pasta, and 12 ordered dessert.\n\nBut the problem says \"each person had either pizza or pasta as their main course,\" implying that there might be some who ordered pizza, but according to the equations, x = 0 is the only solution.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution is that x = 0 is indeed the only possible solution.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\np = number of people who ordered pizza\n\nq = number of people who ordered pasta\n\nSo, p + q = 16\n\nNow, half of those who ordered pizza also ordered dessert: (1/2)p\n\nThree-quarters of those who ordered pasta ordered dessert: (3/4)q\n\nTotal dessert orders: (1/2)p + (3/4)q = 12\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. p + q = 16\n\n2. (1/2)p + (3/4)q = 12\n\nLet\u2019s multiply equation 2 by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2*(p) + 3*q = 48\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, (1/2)p + (3/4)q = 12\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4*(1/2)p + 4*(3/4)q = 4*12\n\n2p + 3q = 48\n\nNow, from equation 1: p + q = 16\n\nLet\u2019s solve this system:\n\np + q = 16\n\n2p + 3q = 48\n\nLet\u2019s multiply the first equation by 2:\n\n2p + 2q = 32\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(2p + 3q) - (2p + 2q) = 48 - 32\n\n2p + 3q - 2p - 2q = 16\n\nq = 16\n\nNow, plug back into the first equation:\n\np + 16 = 16\n\np = 0\n\nSo, again, p = 0 and q = 16.\n\nTherefore, no one ordered pizza; all 16 ordered pasta, and 12 ordered dessert, which aligns with (3/4)*16 = 12.\n\nThus, the number of people who ordered pizza is 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
