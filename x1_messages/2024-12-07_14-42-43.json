For the first part of the trip:\n- Speed: 60 miles per hour\n- Time: 2 hours\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n2. For the second part of the trip:\n- Speed: 80 miles per hour\n- Time: 3 hours\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 80 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 240 miles\n\nNow, let's find the total distance and total time.\n\n- Total distance = 120 miles + 240 miles = 360 miles\n- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours\n\nFinally, the average speed is:\n\n- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 360 miles / 5 hours = 72 miles per hour\n\nSo, the average speed of the car during the entire trip is 72 miles per hour."
