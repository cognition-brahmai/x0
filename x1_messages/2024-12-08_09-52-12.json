        "content": "Pompeii is located near the modern Italian city of Naples. It's in the region of Campania, southern Italy, and is about 24 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Naples. The ruins are situated at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, the volcano that famously erupted in 79 AD, burying Pompeii and nearby towns under volcanic ash and pumice. Today, Pompeii is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most popular tourist attractions in Italy, offering a unique glimpse into Roman life frozen in time.\n"
