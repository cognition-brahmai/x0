What could that be?\n\nWell, when it rains, umbrellas go up. People open their umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. So, maybe the answer is umbrellas. That makes sense because as the rain comes down, umbrellas go up.\n\nBut wait, is there another answer? Maybe something more abstract or natural. Like, does steam go up when it rains? Well, not necessarily. Steam is usually associated with heat, and rain is cool, so maybe not.\n\nOr perhaps it's something related to moisture. When it rains, the humidity is already high, so maybe something related to air pressure. Does air pressure change when it rains? I think air pressure is usually low before rain, and then it might stabilize or change during the rain. But I'm not sure if that fits the riddle.\n\nLet me think differently. Is there a saying or a phrase that relates to something going up when rain comes down? Maybe a metaphor or idiom.\n\nOh, maybe \"spirits.\" As in, people's moods go up when it rains, depending on their perspective. Some people enjoy rain and feel happier when it's raining. So, their spirits go up when the rain comes down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's something more literal. Like, rain comes down from the clouds, but where does something go up to the clouds?\n\nWell, maybe smoke from chimneys or something. But that doesn't seem directly related to the rain coming down.\n\nWait, perhaps it's steam from puddles. When it's warm and it's raining, puddles can sometimes steam, especially if the ground is hot. So, the steam goes up as the rain comes down. That could be a possibility.\n\nBut I think the most straightforward answer is umbrellas. They clearly go up when it rains.\n\nLet me check if there's a traditional answer to this riddle. Sometimes riddles have standard answers that are widely accepted.\n\nAfter a quick search in my database, it seems that the answer is indeed umbrellas. That's the classic response to this riddle.\n\nSo, to sum it up, umbrellas go up when the rain comes down.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{umbrellas}} \\]"
