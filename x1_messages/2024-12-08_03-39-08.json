        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The owner wants to build a fence around the entire garden but with an additional 2-meter buffer zone on all sides. I need to find out what the total area enclosed by the fence will be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the buffer zone means. Since it's an additional 2 meters on all sides, that means the fence won't be right against the garden but will be 2 meters outside the garden on every side.\n\nSo, if the garden is rectangular, with a length of 30 meters and a width of 20 meters, and we're adding 2 meters to all sides, I need to account for that extra space in both directions.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have the garden, which is 30 meters long and 20 meters wide, and I'm adding 2 meters beyond each side for the buffer zone, that means:\n\n- On the length side, there will be 2 meters added to both the front and the back, so that's a total addition of 4 meters to the length.\n\n- Similarly, on the width side, there will be 2 meters added to both sides, left and right, so that's also an additional 4 meters to the width.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nIf the buffer zone is 2 meters on all sides, then for the length:\n\n- 2 meters before the start of the garden\n\n- 2 meters after the end of the garden\n\nSo, total addition to the length is 2 + 2 = 4 meters.\n\nSimilarly, for the width:\n\n- 2 meters to the left of the garden\n\n- 2 meters to the right of the garden\n\nSo, again, 4 meters added to the width.\n\nTherefore, the total dimensions of the area enclosed by the fence would be:\n\n- Length: 30 meters (original) + 4 meters (buffer) = 34 meters\n\n- Width: 20 meters (original) + 4 meters (buffer) = 24 meters\n\nNow, to find the area enclosed by the fence, I just need to multiply the new length by the new width.\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 34 meters \u00d7 24 meters\n\nBut let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Maybe I should draw a diagram to visualize it.\n\nImagine the garden is a rectangle with length 30m and width 20m. Now, around this rectangle, there's a 2-meter buffer zone on all sides. So, the fence will be built 2 meters outside the garden's perimeter on all sides.\n\nSo, starting from the garden:\n\n- The original length is 30m.\n\n- Adding 2m to one end and 2m to the other end adds a total of 4m to the length.\n\n- Similarly, the original width is 20m.\n\n- Adding 2m to one side and 2m to the other side adds a total of 4m to the width.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions for the area enclosed by the fence are:\n\n- Length: 30m + 4m = 34m\n\n- Width: 20m + 4m = 24m\n\nNow, to find the area:\n\nArea = 34m \u00d7 24m\n\nI can calculate this as:\n\n34 \u00d7 24 = (30 + 4) \u00d7 24 = (30 \u00d7 24) + (4 \u00d7 24) = 720 + 96 = 816 square meters\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another way to look at this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the buffer zone as a uniform border around the garden. So, the fence would be surrounding the garden plus this border.\n\nIn terms of area, the total area enclosed by the fence would be the area of the garden plus the area of the buffer zone.\n\nBut calculating it that way might be more complicated. I think the way I did it initially is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider that the buffer zone adds 2 meters to each side, so the fence is essentially a rectangle that is larger than the garden by 4 meters in length and 4 meters in width.\n\nSo, again, length becomes 30 + 4 = 34 meters, and width becomes 20 + 4 = 24 meters.\n\nArea is 34 \u00d7 24, which is 816 square meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the buffer zone.\n\nMaybe someone could think that the 2-meter buffer is only on one side of the garden, but the problem says \"on all sides,\" so it's on both sides of each dimension.\n\nSo, adding 2 meters on each side of the length and each side of the width.\n\nTherefore, the total addition to the length is 4 meters, and to the width is also 4 meters.\n\nSo, the fence encloses an area that is 34 meters by 24 meters, totaling 816 square meters.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{816} \\]"
