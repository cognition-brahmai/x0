If a car is traveling at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour, and we want to know how far it will go in 2 hours and 30 minutes, we can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, speed is 50 miles per hour, and time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. But wait, time needs to be in hours since the speed is per hour. 30 minutes is half an hour, so 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, distance = 50 miles/hour \u00d7 2.5 hours = 125 miles.\n\nYes, that should be it. The car will travel 125 miles in 2 hours and 30 minutes at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
