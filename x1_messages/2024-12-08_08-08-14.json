        "content": "So the factory makes three types of products: X, Y, and Z. The production ratio for these is 2:3:5. That means for every 2 units of X, there are 3 units of Y and 5 units of Z. The total production per day is 500 units. I need to find out how many units of each product are made daily.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the ratio means. The ratio 2:3:5 tells me the relative amounts of X, Y, and Z produced. To find the actual numbers, I need to see how these parts add up to the total production.\n\nLet me think of the ratio as parts. So, X is 2 parts, Y is 3 parts, and Z is 5 parts. The total parts would be 2 + 3 + 5, which is 10 parts altogether.\n\nNow, if 10 parts equal 500 units, then one part would be 500 divided by 10. Let's do that division: 500 \u00f7 10 = 50. So, one part is 50 units.\n\nNow, I can find the number of units for each product by multiplying the number of parts by the value of one part.\n\nFor X: 2 parts \u00d7 50 units/part = 100 units.\n\nFor Y: 3 parts \u00d7 50 units/part = 150 units.\n\nFor Z: 5 parts \u00d7 50 units/part = 250 units.\n\nLet me check if these add up to 500: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500. Perfect, it matches the total production.\n\nSo, the factory produces 100 units of X, 150 units of Y, and 250 units of Z each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ units of X}, 150 \\text{ units of Y}, 250 \\text{ units of Z}} \\]\n"
