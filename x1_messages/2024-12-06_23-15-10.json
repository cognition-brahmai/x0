        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 40 students, and they've received grades A, B, and C. Specifically, 12 students got an A, 16 got a B, and the rest got a C. We need to find the ratio of A's to B's to C's in its simplest form.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many students received each grade. We already know that 12 got A's and 16 got B's. To find out how many got C's, I'll subtract the number of A's and B's from the total number of students.\n\nSo, total students are 40. A's are 12, B's are 16. So, C's would be:\n\nC's = Total students - (A's + B's) = 40 - (12 + 16) = 40 - 28 = 12.\n\nAlright, so 12 students got C's.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- A's: 12\n\n- B's: 16\n\n- C's: 12\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of A's to B's to C's. A ratio compares these quantities, so it would be 12:16:12.\n\nTo simplify this ratio, we should divide each part by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three numbers. First, let's find the GCD of 12, 16, and 12.\n\nLet's list the factors:\n\n- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\n- Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\n\n- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nThe common factors are 1, 2, and 4. The greatest common factor is 4.\n\nNow, divide each part of the ratio by 4:\n\n- A's: 12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\n- B's: 16 \u00f7 4 = 4\n\n- C's: 12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\nSo, the simplified ratio is 3:4:3.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nStarting with the number of students:\n\n- A's: 12\n\n- B's: 16\n\n- C's: 12\n\nTotal is 40, which matches the given total.\n\nNow, the ratio is 12:16:12.\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\n- 16 \u00f7 4 = 4\n\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might look for the ratio in fractions, but since we're dealing with counts of students, the ratio in whole numbers is appropriate.\n\nSo, the simplest form of the ratio of A's to B's to C's is 3:4:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:4:3} \\]"
