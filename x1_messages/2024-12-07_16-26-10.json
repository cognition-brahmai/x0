        "content": "So there are 100 houses in this town, and each house has one cat. That means there are 100 cats in total, right? And each of these cats kills 10 mice every day. So, to find out how many mice all the cats kill in one week, I need to do a few calculations.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many mice all the cats kill in one day. Since each cat kills 10 mice per day, and there are 100 cats, I can multiply 100 cats by 10 mice per cat per day. That would be 100 times 10, which is 1,000 mice per day.\n\nNow, to find out how many mice are killed in one week, I need to multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so 1,000 mice per day times 7 days would be 7,000 mice per week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my math. 100 cats times 10 mice per cat per day is indeed 1,000 mice per day. And 1,000 mice per day times 7 days is 7,000 mice per week. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this number. For example, are there enough mice in the town for all these cats to kill 10 mice per day for a whole week? Or do the mice populations replenish somehow? But the question doesn't provide any information about mouse population dynamics, so I think I should just go with the straightforward calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps I can calculate the total number of mice killed by one cat in a week and then multiply by the number of cats. So, one cat kills 10 mice per day, so in a week, that's 10 mice per day times 7 days, which is 70 mice per week per cat. Then, with 100 cats, it would be 70 mice per week times 100 cats, which again is 7,000 mice per week.\n\nHmm, that matches my first calculation. So, it seems like 7,000 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using rates or something like that. The rate at which mice are being killed is 10 mice per cat per day. So, the total rate for all cats would be 100 cats times 10 mice per cat per day, which is 1,000 mice per day. Then, over a week, that rate sustained would result in 1,000 mice per day times 7 days, which is again 7,000 mice.\n\nI can't think of any other method that would change this result. It seems pretty straightforward. So, I'm confident that the total number of mice killed by all the cats in one week is 7,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7000} \\]"
