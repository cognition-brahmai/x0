        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of products: A and B. Every day, it churns out 250 units of product A and 400 units of product B. Now, each unit of product A needs 3 hours of labor, and each unit of product B requires 2 hours of labor. We need to find out how many workers the factory needs to have to get all this production done in one day, given that each worker works 8 hours a day.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate the total labor hours required for producing all the units of product A and product B separately, and then sum them up to get the total labor hours needed per day.\n\nSo, for product A:\n\nNumber of units: 250\n\nLabor per unit: 3 hours\n\nTotal labor for A: 250 units * 3 hours/unit = 750 hours\n\nFor product B:\n\nNumber of units: 400\n\nLabor per unit: 2 hours\n\nTotal labor for B: 400 units * 2 hours/unit = 800 hours\n\nNow, total labor hours required per day: 750 hours (A) + 800 hours (B) = 1550 hours\n\nNext, each worker works 8 hours a day. So, to find out how many workers are needed, I should divide the total labor hours required by the number of hours one worker can work in a day.\n\nNumber of workers needed: Total labor hours / Hours per worker per day = 1550 hours / 8 hours/workers/day\n\nLet me do the math: 1550 divided by 8 is 193.75\n\nNow, you can't have a fraction of a worker, so I guess they need to hire 194 workers to cover the entire labor requirement.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if 193 workers would be enough. Let's see:\n\n193 workers * 8 hours/day = 1544 hours\n\nBut the total required is 1550 hours, so 1544 is less than 1550 by 6 hours. That means 193 workers aren't enough because there would still be 6 hours of work left undone.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs to have 194 workers to ensure that all the production is completed within one day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can have some workers work overtime, but the question doesn't mention anything about overtime, so I think the assumption is that all workers work exactly 8 hours a day.\n\nAlso, perhaps there's a way to optimize the labor allocation or consider that some tasks can be done in parallel, but given the information provided, I think calculating the total labor hours required and dividing by the daily worker hours is the straightforward approach.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the factory needs 194 workers to complete the production of both products A and B within one day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{194} \\]"
