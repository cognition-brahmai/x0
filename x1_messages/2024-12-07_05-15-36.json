        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an empty bus that arrives at a station, and 15 people get on. That means now there are 15 people on the bus.\n\nThen, it goes to the next stop. Here, half of the passengers get off. So, half of 15 is 7.5, but since we can't have half a person, maybe we should consider if 15 is an even number to divide properly. Wait, 15 is odd, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or maybe it's okay to have half a person in some contexts, but in reality, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to round down or handle the half person differently. But let's assume for now that it's acceptable to have half a person for the sake of the problem, although it's unusual.\n\nSo, half of 15 is 7.5 people get off, leaving 7.5 people still on the bus.\n\nThen, 5 more people get on at this stop. So, 7.5 plus 5 is 12.5 people.\n\nBut again, having half a person doesn't make sense in reality. Perhaps the problem intended for there to be an even number of passengers initially or at some point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bus starts with a certain number of passengers, but the problem says it's empty initially.\n\nWait, let's double-check the problem statement: \"An empty bus arrives at a station. 15 people get on. At the next stop, half of the passengers get off and 5 more get on. How many people are now on the bus?\"\n\nSo, starting with 0 passengers, 15 get on, making it 15. Then, half get off: 7.5, which is problematic. Maybe the problem meant that 15 people get on at the first stop, and then at the next stop, half of them get off, but since half of 15 is 7.5, perhaps there's an error in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bus can't have half a person, so perhaps the problem is expecting us to round down to 7 people getting off, leaving 8 on the bus, and then 5 more get on, making it 13.\n\nOr maybe round up to 8 getting off, leaving 7, and then 5 more get on, making it 12.\n\nBut neither seems perfectly logical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that only whole people can get on and off, so maybe it's a trick question showing that the scenario is impossible with whole numbers.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's acceptable to have a fractional person in this context for the sake of the problem.\n\nSo, starting with 0, 15 get on, making 15. Half get off: 7.5 get off, leaving 7.5 on the bus. Then, 5 more get on, making it 12.5 people.\n\nSo, the answer would be 12.5 people on the bus.\n\nBut again, in reality, that doesn't make sense, so maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that at the first stop, 15 people get on, and the bus wasn't empty initially, but the problem says it was empty, so maybe it's a trick with the wording.\n\nWait, the problem says \"an empty bus arrives at a station. 15 people get on.\" So, initially, it's empty, then 15 people get on, making it 15.\n\nThen, \"at the next stop, half of the passengers get off.\" So, half of 15 is 7.5, which is problematic.\n\nPerhaps the problem should have specified an even number of passengers initially or at some point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume that 7 people get off, and 8 remain, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's intended to be a real-world scenario where half a person is impossible, so perhaps the answer is that the scenario is invalid.\n\nBut maybe I should just accept that in this problem, fractions of people are acceptable, and go with 12.5 people on the bus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as 15 people getting on, half getting off (7.5), and then 5 more getting on, making it 12.5.\n\nBut since we can't have half a person, perhaps the answer is that there are 12 or 13 people on the bus, depending on rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to highlight the importance of whole numbers in certain contexts.\n\nBut given the problem as stated, I think the answer is 12.5 people on the bus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.5} \\]"
