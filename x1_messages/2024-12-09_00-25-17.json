        "content": "Let's see. The company sells two products, X and Y, and they make different profits per unit for each. For product X, the profit per unit is $10, and they sold 800 units of it. For product Y, the profit per unit is $15, and they sold 1,200 units of it. I need to find out the total profit from both products combined.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total profit from product X. Since each unit of X brings in $10, and they sold 800 units, I can multiply 10 by 800 to get that amount.\n\nSimilarly, for product Y, each unit brings in $15, and they sold 1,200 units, so I'll multiply 15 by 1,200 to find out the profit from Y.\n\nThen, I'll add both profits together to get the total profit.\n\nLet me do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, profit from X:\n\n10 * 800 = 8,000 dollars.\n\nNext, profit from Y:\n\n15 * 1,200.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n15 * 1,000 = 15,000\n\nAnd 15 * 200 = 3,000\n\nSo, 15,000 + 3,000 = 18,000 dollars.\n\nNow, total profit is profit from X plus profit from Y:\n\n8,000 + 18,000 = 26,000 dollars.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with X: 10 * 800 = 8,000, that seems correct.\n\nFor Y: 15 * 1,200.\n\nI broke it down into 15 * 1,000 = 15,000 and 15 * 200 = 3,000, which adds up to 18,000. That seems right too.\n\nAdding both: 8,000 + 18,000 = 26,000.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nTotal profit = (profit per unit of X * units of X) + (profit per unit of Y * units of Y)\n\nWhich is (10 * 800) + (15 * 1,200) = 8,000 + 18,000 = 26,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate it differently to confirm.\n\nLet me calculate the total units sold: 800 + 1,200 = 2,000 units.\n\nBut since the profit per unit is different for X and Y, I can't just multiply the average profit by total units. That might not give me the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the weighted average profit per unit.\n\nWeighted average profit per unit = (profit from X + profit from Y) / total units sold\n\nWhich would be (8,000 + 18,000) / 2,000 = 26,000 / 2,000 = 13 dollars per unit.\n\nBut that's just a check, not necessary for the total profit.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to, I could calculate the total revenue and then subtract total costs, but since they directly gave profit per unit, it's simpler to just multiply profit per unit by units sold and sum them up.\n\nWait, profit per unit already accounts for costs, so total profit should just be the sum of profits from each product.\n\nSo, yes, total profit is 26,000 dollars.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26000} \\]"
