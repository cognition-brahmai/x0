        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a factory that produces two types of products, C and D. Each product requires a certain amount of labor hours, and there's a limit to how many hours the factory can work per week. Also, each product brings in a different amount of profit per unit sold. The goal is to figure out how many units of each product the factory should produce to maximize its weekly profit.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the constraints and the objective.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. Labor hours: Product C requires 3 hours per unit, and product D requires 2 hours per unit. The total labor hours available per week are 600.\n\nObjective:\n\nMaximize weekly profit: Product C gives $50 per unit, and product D gives $30 per unit.\n\nSo, this seems like a linear programming problem, where we have to optimize the profit function given the constraints.\n\nLet me define the variables:\n\nLet x be the number of units of product C produced per week.\n\nLet y be the number of units of product D produced per week.\n\nNow, the constraint based on labor hours can be expressed as:\n\n3x + 2y \u2264 600\n\nAlso, since the number of units produced can't be negative:\n\nx \u2265 0\n\ny \u2265 0\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\n\nP = 50x + 30y\n\nSo, the problem is to maximize P = 50x + 30y, subject to 3x + 2y \u2264 600, and x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0.\n\nTo solve this, I can graph the constraint and find the feasible region, then identify the corner points and evaluate the profit function at each of them to find the maximum.\n\nFirst, graph the constraint 3x + 2y \u2264 600.\n\nLet's find the intercepts:\n\nWhen x = 0:\n\n3(0) + 2y = 600 \u2192 y = 300\n\nWhen y = 0:\n\n3x + 2(0) = 600 \u2192 x = 200\n\nSo, the line 3x + 2y = 600 passes through (0,300) and (200,0).\n\nThe feasible region is below this line, including the axes, since x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0.\n\nNow, the corner points of the feasible region are:\n\n1. (0,0)\n\n2. (200,0)\n\n3. (0,300)\n\n4. The intersection point of 3x + 2y = 600 with the axes.\n\nWait, actually, points 2 and 3 are already the intercepts. Is there another intersection point? No, in this case, it's a single constraint besides the non-negativity.\n\nSo, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (200,0), and (0,300).\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the profit function P = 50x + 30y at each of these points.\n\n1. At (0,0):\n\nP = 50(0) + 30(0) = $0\n\n2. At (200,0):\n\nP = 50(200) + 30(0) = $10,000\n\n3. At (0,300):\n\nP = 50(0) + 30(300) = $9,000\n\nSo, among these points, the maximum profit is $10,000 at (200,0).\n\nWait a minute, is that really the maximum? Let me check if there's a better combination of x and y.\n\nMaybe there's a point inside the feasible region that gives higher profit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in considering only the corner points.\n\nActually, in linear programming, the optimal value always occurs at a corner point or along an edge, but in this case, since it's a two-variable problem, checking the corner points is sufficient.\n\nBut let me see if there's a better point between (200,0) and (0,300).\n\nSuppose we produce some units of both C and D.\n\nLet's try to see if that increases the profit.\n\nFor example, let's say x = 100, y = 150.\n\nCheck if 3(100) + 2(150) \u2264 600.\n\nThat's 300 + 300 = 600, which is equal to the constraint.\n\nNow, P = 50(100) + 30(150) = 5,000 + 4,500 = $9,500\n\nThat's less than $10,000 at (200,0).\n\nWhat about x = 150, y = 100.\n\nCheck 3(150) + 2(100) = 450 + 200 = 650, which exceeds 600, so not feasible.\n\nx = 180, y = 30.\n\nCheck 3(180) + 2(30) = 540 + 60 = 600.\n\nP = 50(180) + 30(30) = 9,000 + 900 = $9,900\n\nStill less than $10,000.\n\nx = 200, y = 0 gives P = $10,000\n\nx = 0, y = 300 gives P = $9,000\n\nSo, producing only product C seems to maximize the profit.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the slope of the profit function compared to the constraint.\n\nThe profit function is P = 50x + 30y.\n\nThe gradient is (50,30).\n\nThe constraint is 3x + 2y \u2264 600, which has a gradient of (3,2).\n\nThe ratio of the coefficients is 50/3 and 30/2.\n\nLet's see, 50/3 \u2248 16.67 and 30/2 = 15.\n\nSince 16.67 > 15, meaning the profit per labor hour for product C is higher than for product D.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to produce as much of product C as possible, given the labor constraints.\n\nIn this case, producing 200 units of C and 0 units of D maximizes the profit at $10,000 per week.\n\nAlternatively, if there were other constraints, such as demand limits for each product, or if the profit per labor hour was higher for product D, the optimal production mix might be different.\n\nBut based on the information provided, producing 200 units of C and no units of D is the best strategy to maximize profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200 \\text{ units of product C and } 0 \\text{ units of product D}} \\]"
