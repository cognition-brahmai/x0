        "content": "So, the question is: Every day, a tree drops 7 leaves. How many leaves would it drop in a month of February in a non-leap year? And I need to include my logic.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to know how many days are in February during a non-leap year.\n\nI remember that February is the shortest month, and in a non-leap year, it has 28 days. Leap years have 29 days in February, but since it's specified as a non-leap year, it's 28 days.\n\nSo, if the tree drops 7 leaves every day, and there are 28 days in February, I can find the total number of leaves dropped by multiplying the number of leaves per day by the number of days in the month.\n\nThat is:\n\nTotal leaves = leaves per day \u00d7 number of days\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal leaves = 7 leaves/day \u00d7 28 days\n\nNow, 7 times 28. Let me calculate that.\n\n7 times 20 is 140, and 7 times 8 is 56. So, 140 plus 56 equals 196.\n\nTherefore, the tree would drop 196 leaves in February of a non-leap year.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. Another way to think about it is to consider that 7 times 28 is the same as 7 times 4 weeks, since February has 4 weeks in a non-leap year.\n\n7 leaves/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 49 leaves/week\n\nThen, 49 leaves/week \u00d7 4 weeks = 196 leaves\n\nSame answer. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of weeks and days, February has 4 full weeks and no extra days in a non-leap year.\n\nSo, 4 weeks \u00d7 7 days/week = 28 days\n\nThen, 28 days \u00d7 7 leaves/day = 196 leaves\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that the tree drops 196 leaves in February of a non-leap year.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should confirm the number of days in February in a non-leap year.\n\nYes, February has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year.\n\nSince the question specifies a non-leap year, it's definitely 28 days.\n\nAlso, the question states that the tree drops 7 leaves every day without any exceptions, so I can assume that the daily drop is constant.\n\nTherefore, multiplying the daily drop by the number of days in the month gives the total leaves dropped in that month.\n\nSo, total leaves = 7 leaves/day \u00d7 28 days = 196 leaves\n\nI don't think there's any need for further calculation or consideration.\n\nUnless... maybe the tree drops leaves at a different rate on certain days, but the question doesn't suggest that. It says \"every day,\" so it's safe to assume a constant rate.\n\nAlso, the question doesn't mention any external factors like weather affecting the leaf drop, so I don't need to consider anything beyond the given information.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 196 leaves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{196} \\]"
