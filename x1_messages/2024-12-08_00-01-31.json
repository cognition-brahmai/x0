        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of candy bars: one costs $1.50 each, and the other costs $2.00 each. The customer buys a total of 20 candy bars and spends exactly $35. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should assign variables to represent the unknowns. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of $1.50 candy bars.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of $2.00 candy bars.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candy bars is 20.\n\n2. The total cost is $35.\n\nWe can translate these into equations.\n\nFrom the first piece of information:\n\n\\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\nFrom the second piece of information:\n\n\\( 1.50x + 2.00y = 35 \\)\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( 1.50x + 2.00y = 35 \\)\n\nI think the easiest way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for one variable, say \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - y \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 1.50(20 - y) + 2.00y = 35 \\)\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\nFirst, multiply 1.50 by (20 - y):\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times 20 = 30 \\)\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times (-y) = -1.50y \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( 30 - 1.50y + 2.00y = 35 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 30 + (2.00y - 1.50y) = 35 \\)\n\n\\( 30 + 0.50y = 35 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 30 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.50y = 5 \\)\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.50:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nSo, the number of $2.00 candy bars is 10.\n\nNow, substitute \\( y = 10 \\) back into the equation \\( x = 20 - y \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - 10 = 10 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 10 candy bars of each type.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure it adds up correctly.\n\nIf \\( x = 10 \\) and \\( y = 10 \\):\n\nTotal cost: \\( 1.50 \\times 10 + 2.00 \\times 10 = 15 + 20 = 35 \\), which matches the given total.\n\nTotal candy bars: \\( 10 + 10 = 20 \\), which also matches.\n\nSo, the solution seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the elimination method. Let's try that to confirm.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( 1.50x + 2.00y = 35 \\)\n\nTo eliminate one variable, we can manipulate the equations so that when we add or subtract them, one variable cancels out.\n\nLet's try to eliminate \\( x \\). To do that, we can multiply the first equation by -1.50:\n\n\\( -1.50x - 1.50y = -30 \\)\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n\n\\( (-1.50x - 1.50y) + (1.50x + 2.00y) = -30 + 35 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( (-1.50x + 1.50x) + (-1.50y + 2.00y) = 5 \\)\n\n\\( 0x + 0.50y = 5 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 0.50y = 5 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.50:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nAgain, we get \\( y = 10 \\), and substituting back into the first equation gives \\( x = 10 \\).\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method used, the answer remains the same: the customer bought 10 candy bars of each type.\n\nJust to explore another approach, let's think about this problem without using algebra.\n\nSuppose all 20 candy bars are the cheaper type, costing $1.50 each. Then the total cost would be \\( 20 \\times 1.50 = 30 \\) dollars.\n\nBut the customer actually spent $35, which is $5 more than $30.\n\nThe difference must come from buying some of the more expensive candy bars. Each time we replace a $1.50 candy bar with a $2.00 candy bar, the cost increases by \\( 2.00 - 1.50 = 0.50 \\) dollars.\n\nSo, to make up the $5 difference, the number of $2.00 candy bars is \\( 5 / 0.50 = 10 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 10 candy bars at $2.00 each, and the remaining \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) candy bars are at $1.50 each.\n\nThis confirms our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume all candy bars are the $2.00 type, the total cost would be \\( 20 \\times 2.00 = 40 \\) dollars.\n\nBut the customer spent only $35, which is $5 less than $40.\n\nEach time we replace a $2.00 candy bar with a $1.50 candy bar, the cost decreases by $0.50.\n\nSo, to make up the $5 difference, the number of $1.50 candy bars is \\( 5 / 0.50 = 10 \\).\n\nThus, there are 10 candy bars at $1.50 each, and \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) at $2.00 each.\n\nAgain, this matches our earlier findings.\n\nTherefore, no matter which method we use, the conclusion is the same: the customer bought 10 candy bars of each type.\n\nTo summarize, the customer purchased 10 candy bars at $1.50 each and 10 candy bars at $2.00 each, totaling 20 candy bars and spending exactly $35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ candy bars at } \\$1.50 \\text{ each and } 10 \\text{ candy bars at } \\$2.00 \\text{ each}} \\]"
