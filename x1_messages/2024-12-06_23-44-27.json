        "content": "Let's see. The train is going from City A to City B, and the distance between them is 180 miles. The train's speed is constant at 60 miles per hour. It leaves City A at 2:00 PM, and I need to find out when it will arrive in City B.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how long the journey will take. Since speed is distance divided by time, I can rearrange that to find time is distance divided by speed. So, time = distance / speed.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: time = 180 miles / 60 mph. That should be 3 hours.\n\nSo, the train takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.\n\nNow, it leaves at 2:00 PM. If the journey takes 3 hours, I just need to add 3 hours to the departure time to find the arrival time.\n\n2:00 PM plus 3 hours is 5:00 PM.\n\nTherefore, the train will arrive in City B at 5:00 PM.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nThe speed is constant at 60 mph, and the distance is 180 miles. Yes, time is definitely 180 divided by 60, which is 3 hours.\n\nAdding 3 hours to 2:00 PM brings us to 5:00 PM.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5:00 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
