        "content": "Let's tackle this problem. I have 50 coins that add up to $1.00, and I need to figure out what kinds of coins they are. In the US, the common coins are pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents). I need to find out how many of each we have.\n\nFirst, I'll set up some variables to represent the number of each type of coin:\n\n- Let p be the number of pennies.\n\n- Let n be the number of nickels.\n\n- Let d be the number of dimes.\n\n- Let q be the number of quarters.\n\nI know two things:\n\n1. The total number of coins is 50.\n\n2. The total value of the coins is $1.00, which is 100 cents.\n\nSo, I can write two equations based on this information.\n\nThe first equation is for the total number of coins:\n\np + n + d + q = 50\n\nThe second equation is for the total value:\n\n1p + 5n + 10d + 25q = 100\n\nNow, I have two equations with four variables. That seems tricky because it's underdetermined\u2014there are more variables than equations. Usually, with fewer equations than variables, there are infinitely many solutions. But in this case, since we're dealing with coins, the variables have to be non-negative integers, which might limit the possible solutions.\n\nMaybe I can make some assumptions or find some relationships between the variables to reduce the number of variables.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I can try to eliminate some variables.\n\nSuppose I solve the first equation for p:\n\np = 50 - n - d - q\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for p into the second equation:\n\n1*(50 - n - d - q) + 5n + 10d + 25q = 100\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n50 - n - d - q + 5n + 10d + 25q = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n50 + ( -n + 5n ) + ( -d + 10d ) + ( -q + 25q ) = 100\n\n50 + 4n + 9d + 24q = 100\n\nNow, subtract 50 from both sides:\n\n4n + 9d + 24q = 50\n\nHmm, that's one equation with three variables. Still tricky, but maybe I can make some observations.\n\nFirst, all variables n, d, q must be non-negative integers.\n\nLet me see if I can find some constraints based on the maximum possible values for each variable.\n\nLet's consider the quarter (q). Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, and we have a total of 100 cents, the maximum number of quarters we can have is 100 / 25 = 4 quarters. But we also have to consider that we need a total of 50 coins.\n\nWait, but if we have 4 quarters, that's 100 cents already, but we need 50 coins. So, we would need 4 quarters and 46 pennies, but that would total 4*25 + 46*1 = 100 + 46 = 146 cents, which is way over 100 cents. So, having 4 quarters is not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider the value equation:\n\n4n + 9d + 24q = 50\n\nI need to find non-negative integers n, d, q that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet me consider the possible values for q.\n\nSince 24q is a multiple of 24, and it's less than or equal to 50, possible values for q are 0, 1, or 2.\n\nBecause 24*2 = 48, and 24*3 = 72, which is greater than 50.\n\nSo, q can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nLet's consider each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: q = 0**\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n4n + 9d = 50\n\nNow, I need to find non-negative integers n and d that satisfy this.\n\nLet me solve for n in terms of d:\n\n4n = 50 - 9d\n\nn = (50 - 9d)/4\n\nSince n must be an integer, (50 - 9d) must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet me find values of d that make 50 - 9d divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try d = 0:\n\n50 - 0 = 50, 50 divided by 4 is 12.5, not an integer.\n\nd = 1:\n\n50 - 9 = 41, 41/4 = 10.25, not integer.\n\nd = 2:\n\n50 - 18 = 32, 32/4 = 8, which is an integer.\n\nSo, d = 2, n = 8.\n\nLet me check if this works.\n\nFrom earlier, p = 50 - n - d - q = 50 - 8 - 2 - 0 = 40.\n\nSo, p = 40, n = 8, d = 2, q = 0.\n\nLet's check the value:\n\n40*1 + 8*5 + 2*10 + 0*25 = 40 + 40 + 20 + 0 = 100 cents. Perfect.\n\nBut is this the only solution? Let's check other possible d values.\n\nd = 3:\n\n50 - 27 = 23, 23/4 = 5.75, not integer.\n\nd = 4:\n\n50 - 36 = 14, 14/4 = 3.5, not integer.\n\nd = 5:\n\n50 - 45 = 5, 5/4 = 1.25, not integer.\n\nd = 6:\n\n50 - 54 = -4, negative, not possible.\n\nSo, in this case, only d = 2 works, giving n = 8, p = 40, q = 0.\n\n**Case 2: q = 1**\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n4n + 9d + 24*1 = 50 \u21d2 4n + 9d = 26\n\nSolve for n:\n\n4n = 26 - 9d\n\nn = (26 - 9d)/4\n\nNeed (26 - 9d) to be divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try d = 0:\n\n26 - 0 = 26, 26/4 = 6.5, not integer.\n\nd = 1:\n\n26 - 9 = 17, 17/4 = 4.25, not integer.\n\nd = 2:\n\n26 - 18 = 8, 8/4 = 2, integer.\n\nSo, d = 2, n = 2.\n\nThen, p = 50 - n - d - q = 50 - 2 - 2 - 1 = 45.\n\nCheck the value:\n\n45*1 + 2*5 + 2*10 + 1*25 = 45 + 10 + 20 + 25 = 100 cents. Perfect.\n\nCheck d = 3:\n\n26 - 27 = -1, negative, not possible.\n\nSo, only d = 2 works here, giving n = 2, p = 45, q = 1.\n\n**Case 3: q = 2**\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n4n + 9d + 24*2 = 48 \u21d2 4n + 9d = 2\n\nSolve for n:\n\n4n = 2 - 9d\n\nn = (2 - 9d)/4\n\nNeed (2 - 9d) to be divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try d = 0:\n\n2 - 0 = 2, 2/4 = 0.5, not integer.\n\nd = 1:\n\n2 - 9 = -7, -7/4 = -1.75, not integer.\n\nHigher d would make it more negative.\n\nSo, no solutions in this case.\n\nTherefore, only two possible solutions:\n\n1. p = 40, n = 8, d = 2, q = 0\n\n2. p = 45, n = 2, d = 2, q = 1\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nIn case 1, q = 0, d = 2, n = 8, p = 40.\n\nIn case 2, q = 1, d = 2, n = 2, p = 45.\n\nIn case 3, q = 2, no solution.\n\nSo, there are two possible combinations that satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut the problem says \"what are the coins?\" as if there is one answer. Maybe I need to see which one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps there's only one correct answer. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me check both combinations:\n\nFirst combination:\n\n- 40 pennies = 40 cents\n\n- 8 nickels = 40 cents\n\n- 2 dimes = 20 cents\n\n- 0 quarters = 0 cents\n\nTotal: 40 + 40 + 20 + 0 = 100 cents, 50 coins.\n\nSecond combination:\n\n- 45 pennies = 45 cents\n\n- 2 nickels = 10 cents\n\n- 2 dimes = 20 cents\n\n- 1 quarter = 25 cents\n\nTotal: 45 + 10 + 20 + 25 = 100 cents, 50 coins.\n\nBoth seem to work. Maybe both are possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint I missed. Maybe only one of these is possible given standard coin usage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects only one solution, so maybe I need to see which one is more likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet me assume that there are no quarters, and see what happens.\n\nThen, p + n + d = 50\n\nAnd p + 5n + 10d = 100\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(p + 5n + 10d) - (p + n + d) = 100 - 50\n\n4n + 9d = 50\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for q = 1:\n\np + n + d = 49\n\np + 5n + 10d = 75\n\nSubtract:\n\n4n + 9d = 26\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nAnd for q = 2:\n\np + n + d = 48\n\np + 5n + 10d = 50\n\nSubtract:\n\n4n + 9d = 2\n\nNo solution.\n\nSo, only two possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to have more quarters.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that q can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nBut maybe q can be 3 or more.\n\nWait, 3 quarters would be 75 cents, then we need 50 - 3 = 47 coins to make up 25 cents.\n\nBut 47 coins of 1 cent each would only make 47 cents, which is more than needed.\n\nWait, no. If q = 3, then p + n + d = 47\n\nAnd p + 5n + 10d = 25\n\nThen, subtract:\n\n4n + 9d = -22\n\nNegative value, not possible.\n\nSo, q cannot be 3 or more.\n\nTherefore, only q = 0 or q = 1 are possible.\n\nSo, the two solutions I have are valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to have more dimes or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to have more nickels.\n\nWait, let me see if there are other combinations.\n\nSuppose q = 1, d = 3.\n\nThen, p + n + 3 = 50 \u21d2 p + n = 47\n\nAnd p + 5n + 30 + 25 = 100 \u21d2 p + 5n = 45\n\nThen, subtract:\n\n4n = -2, not possible.\n\nSimilarly, q = 1, d = 1:\n\np + n + 1 = 50 \u21d2 p + n = 49\n\nP + 5n + 10 + 25 = 100 \u21d2 p + 5n = 65\n\nSubtract:\n\n4n = 16 \u21d2 n = 4\n\nThen, p = 49 - 4 = 45\n\nCheck: p = 45, n = 4, d = 1, q = 1\n\nValue: 45*1 + 4*5 + 1*10 + 1*25 = 45 + 20 + 10 + 25 = 100 cents.\n\nWait, but earlier I had d = 2, n = 2, p = 45, q = 1.\n\nWait, this is a third combination.\n\nWait, did I miss this earlier?\n\nWait, in the earlier case, for q = 1, I only considered d = 2.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom 4n + 9d = 26\n\nn = (26 - 9d)/4\n\nFor d = 0: 26/4 = 6.5, not integer.\n\nd = 1: 17/4 = 4.25, not integer.\n\nd = 2: 8/4 = 2, integer.\n\nd = 3: -1, negative.\n\nSo, only d = 2 works for q = 1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of q = 1, d = 1, n = 4, p = 45.\n\nBut according to the equation, only d = 2 works.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, if q = 1, d = 1, then:\n\np + n = 49\n\nP + 5n = 65\n\nThen, 4n = 16 \u21d2 n = 4, p = 45.\n\nBut according to the earlier equation 4n + 9d = 26, with d = 1, n = 4:\n\n4*4 + 9*1 = 16 + 9 = 25, not 26.\n\nWait, that's not matching.\n\nSo, this is not a valid solution.\n\nI must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, if q = 1, d = 1, n = 4, p = 45:\n\nTotal value: 45*1 + 4*5 + 1*10 + 1*25 = 45 + 20 + 10 + 25 = 100 cents.\n\nBut according to the equation, it shouldn't work, but it does.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier equation is incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the equation 4n + 9d = 26 for q = 1 is correct, and d = 2, n = 2 is the only solution.\n\nBut the other combination I tried also gives 100 cents.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is not accounting for all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the equation is only valid if all variables are non-negative integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple solutions.\n\nLet me check another combination.\n\nSuppose q = 1, d = 2, n = 2, p = 45.\n\nValue: 45*1 + 2*5 + 2*10 + 1*25 = 45 + 10 + 20 + 25 = 100 cents.\n\nAnother combination: q = 1, d = 1, n = 4, p = 45.\n\nValue: 45*1 + 4*5 + 1*10 + 1*25 = 45 + 20 + 10 + 25 = 100 cents.\n\nBut according to the equation 4n + 9d = 26, with d = 1, n = 4:\n\n4*4 + 9*1 = 16 + 9 = 25, not 26.\n\nSo, it doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nBut the total value is still 100 cents.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an error in my equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in substituting.\n\nWait, let's revisit the equation.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nAfter substituting p = 50 - n - d - q into the value equation, we get:\n\n4n + 9d + 24q = 50\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nFor q = 1, d = 2, n = 2:\n\n4*2 + 9*2 + 24*1 = 8 + 18 + 24 = 50, which matches.\n\nFor q = 1, d = 1, n = 4:\n\n4*4 + 9*1 + 24*1 = 16 + 9 + 24 = 49, not 50.\n\nSo, this combination doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated p + 5n + 10d + 25q = 100, it worked.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the total value for q = 1, d = 1, n = 4, p = 45:\n\n45*1 + 4*5 + 1*10 + 1*25 = 45 + 20 + 10 + 25 = 100 cents.\n\nBut according to the equation 4n + 9d + 24q = 50, it should be 49.\n\nWait, that means this combination doesn't satisfy the equation, but the total value is still 100 cents.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is only necessary, not sufficient.\n\nThat is, satisfying the equation is necessary but not sufficient to ensure the total value is 100 cents.\n\nWait, no, I think I need to re-examine how I derived the equation.\n\nLet me derive it again.\n\nStarting with:\n\np + n + d + q = 50\n\nAnd p + 5n + 10d + 25q = 100\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(p + 5n + 10d + 25q) - (p + n + d + q) = 100 - 50\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4n + 9d + 24q = 50\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, any combination that doesn't satisfy this equation can't be a valid solution, even if the total value is 100 cents.\n\nWait, but in this case, q = 1, d = 1, n = 4, p = 45 satisfies the total value but not the equation.\n\nBut according to the equation, it should not be a valid solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\np + n + d + q = 50\n\nP + 5n + 10d + 25q = 100\n\nSubtract the first from the second:\n\n(p - p) + (5n - n) + (10d - d) + (25q - q) = 100 - 50\n\nWhich is:\n\n0 + 4n + 9d + 24q = 50\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the combination q = 1, d = 1, n = 4, p = 45 does not satisfy this equation because 4*4 + 9*1 + 24*1 = 16 + 9 + 24 = 49, not 50.\n\nYet, the total value is 100 cents.\n\nTherefore, even though the total value is 100 cents, it doesn't satisfy the equation, meaning it's not a valid solution.\n\nThus, the only valid solutions are those that satisfy both the total number of coins and the equation 4n + 9d + 24q = 50.\n\nTherefore, only the two combinations I found earlier are valid:\n\n1. q = 0, d = 2, n = 8, p = 40\n\n2. q = 1, d = 2, n = 2, p = 45\n\nBoth satisfy the equation:\n\nFirst: 4*8 + 9*2 + 24*0 = 32 + 18 + 0 = 50\n\nSecond: 4*2 + 9*2 + 24*1 = 8 + 18 + 24 = 50\n\nAnd both have a total value of 100 cents.\n\nTherefore, these are the only possible solutions.\n\nSo, to answer the question, there are two possible combinations of 50 coins that total $1.00:\n\n- 40 pennies, 8 nickels, 2 dimes, and 0 quarters.\n\n- 45 pennies, 2 nickels, 2 dimes, and 1 quarter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{40 pennies, 8 nickels, 2 dimes, and 0 quarters or 45 pennies, 2 nickels, 2 dimes, and 1 quarter}} \\]"
