        "content": "To prove that the sum of the angles in any triangle always equals 180 degrees, we can use a method involving parallel lines and the properties of angles formed by a transversal. Let's consider a triangle ABC with angles A, B, and C.\n\n1. **Draw a line parallel to side BC passing through point A.** Let's call this line DE, where D is on AB extended if necessary, and E is on AC extended if necessary.\n\n2. **Identify the angles formed by the parallel line and the transversals.** Since DE is parallel to BC, and AB and AC are transversals, we can use the corresponding angles postulate.\n\n3. **Corresponding angles are equal.** Therefore, angle DAB is equal to angle CBA (angle B), and angle EAC is equal to angle ACB (angle C).\n\n4. **Sum of angles on a straight line.** The angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle DAB + angle BAC + angle EAC = 180 degrees.\n\n5. **Substitute the corresponding angles.** Since angle DAB = angle B and angle EAC = angle C, we can substitute these into the equation: angle B + angle A + angle C = 180 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.\n\nThis proof holds for any triangle, regardless of its shape or size, because the properties of parallel lines and the sum of angles on a straight line are fundamental geometric principles that apply universally."
