        "content": "In the quiet of the twilight, where the world seems still,\nTwo hearts found solace, side by side they\u2019d sit and fill\nTheir souls with words that only friends can share,\nA bond so deep, beyond compare.\n\nLike stars that twinkle in the night's embrace,\nTheir friendship shone, a guiding grace.\nThrough life's dark paths and brightest days,\nThey walked together, come what may.\n\n\"Not proud, though ambitious,\" she'd say,\nWith a smile that lit up the grey.\nHe, in turn, would offer a hand,\nIn times of need, across the land.\n\nEmily's words, like threads so fine,\nWove through their lives, a tapestry divine.\n\"Hope\" is the thing with feathers,\nThat perches in the soul, they'd recall,\nAnd though the storm may howl and scrawl,\nTheir hope remained, a constant call.\n\nIn letters penned with ink so bold,\nThey shared their dreams, young and old.\n\"Because I could not stop for Death\u2014\nHe kindly stopped for me,\" they'd quote,\nFinding comfort in the note\nThat even in life's final note,\nFriendship endures, a sweet abode.\n\nSo here's to friends, like stars above,\nWhose light guides us, through life's rough love.\nMay our bonds, like Emily's verse,\nEndure the test of time, and curse\nNo foe with malice, but instead,\nEmbrace the journey, hand in hand,\nTill the last leaf falls, and the year is done,\nIn friendship's embrace, we've just begun.\n\n**--Inspired by Emily Dickinson**"
