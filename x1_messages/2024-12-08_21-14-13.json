        "content": "Let's tackle this bacteria population problem step by step. So, we've got a bacteria population that doubles every hour. We start with an initial population of 50 bacteria, and we want to know how many there will be after 6 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the population to double every hour. That means that every hour, the number of bacteria increases by a factor of 2. So, if I have X bacteria at a certain hour, the next hour I'll have 2X bacteria.\n\nGiven that, I can approach this in a few ways. One way is to just keep multiplying by 2 for each hour that passes. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with 50 bacteria:\n\n- After 1 hour: 50 * 2 = 100\n\n- After 2 hours: 100 * 2 = 200\n\n- After 3 hours: 200 * 2 = 400\n\n- After 4 hours: 400 * 2 = 800\n\n- After 5 hours: 800 * 2 = 1600\n\n- After 6 hours: 1600 * 2 = 3200\n\nSo, after 6 hours, there would be 3200 bacteria.\n\nBut maybe there's a more efficient way to calculate this without having to multiply 6 times. I recall that exponential growth is involved here since the population is doubling at regular intervals.\n\nThe general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times r^{t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- P is the final population\n\n- P_0 is the initial population\n\n- r is the growth rate\n\n- t is time\n\nIn this case, the growth rate r is 2 because the population doubles, and t is 6 hours.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P = 50 \\times 2^{6} \\]\n\nI know that 2 raised to the 6th power is 64.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P = 50 \\times 64 = 3200 \\]\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by multiplying step by step.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that formula. Exponential growth can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times e^{rt} \\]\n\nWhere e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the continuous growth rate, and t is time.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the population doubles every hour, using \\( P = P_0 \\times 2^{t} \\) seems more appropriate because it directly reflects the doubling effect per hour.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for this problem, \\( P = P_0 \\times 2^{t} \\) is the right formula to use.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of exponential functions based on the hour.\n\nAt time t=0, P=50\n\nt=1, P=50*2=100\n\nt=2, P=50*2^2=200\n\n...\n\nt=6, P=50*2^6=3200\n\nSame result.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if the doubling wasn't exactly every hour, but that's not the case here. The problem states clearly that the population doubles every hour.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes in bacteria growth problems, the growth rate might be given in terms of a percentage increase per unit time, but here it's directly stated as doubling every hour, so the doubling time is 1 hour.\n\nIt's also important to note that this is exponential growth, assuming unlimited resources and ideal conditions for the bacteria to double every hour.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, bacteria growth is often modeled with logistic growth, where there's a carrying capacity that limits the population growth. But based on the problem, we're dealing with unrestricted exponential growth.\n\nSo, sticking with the formula \\( P = P_0 \\times 2^{t} \\), and plugging in P_0=50 and t=6, we get P=3200.\n\nLet me verify this with a different approach. Suppose I use the formula for exponential growth with a growth rate.\n\nThe doubling time T is 1 hour. The relationship between the growth rate r and the doubling time T is:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T} = \\ln(2) \\text{ per hour} \\]\n\nThen, using the exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times e^{rt} = 50 \\times e^{(\\ln(2)) \\times 6} \\]\n\nSince \\( e^{\\ln(2) \\times 6} = (e^{\\ln(2)})^{6} = 2^{6} = 64 \\), so again:\n\n\\[ P = 50 \\times 64 = 3200 \\]\n\nSame answer. This reinforces that 3200 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the binary progression. Each hour, the population multiplies by 2, so after 6 hours, it's multiplied by 2 six times, which is 2^6 = 64 times the initial population.\n\n50 * 64 = 3200.\n\nI can also break it down using percentages. Doubling is a 100% increase each hour. So each hour, the population increases by 100% of its current value.\n\nStarting with 50:\n\n- After 1 hour: 50 + 50 = 100\n\n- After 2 hours: 100 + 100 = 200\n\n- After 3 hours: 200 + 200 = 400\n\n- After 4 hours: 400 + 400 = 800\n\n- After 5 hours: 800 + 800 = 1600\n\n- After 6 hours: 1600 + 1600 = 3200\n\nAgain, 3200.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for compound growth, where the growth occurs discretely at each hour:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^{t} \\]\n\nHere, r is 100%, or 1 in decimal form, and t is 6 hours.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P = 50 \\times (1 + 1)^{6} = 50 \\times 2^{6} = 50 \\times 64 = 3200 \\]\n\n\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f3200\u7ec6\u83cc\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u6ca1\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u68c0\u67e5\u4e00\u4e0b2\u76846\u6b21\u65b9\u662f\u5426\u786e\u5b9e\u662f64\u3002\n\n2^1 = 2\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n2^4 = 16\n\n2^5 = 32\n\n2^6 = 64\n\n\u6ca1\u9519\uff0c2\u76846\u6b21\u65b9\u662f64\u3002\n\n\u7136\u540e\uff0c50\u4e58\u4ee564\u7b49\u4e8e3200\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f3200\u7ec6\u83cc\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3200} \\]"
