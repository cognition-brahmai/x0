        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Node.js script that listens for HTTP requests and logs details about each request to a text file. I need to make sure it can take command-line arguments for the port and the log file path. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic HTTP server in Node.js. I know that Node has the built-in `http` module for this purpose. I can create a server that listens on a specific port, which I'll get from the command line.\n\nNext, for each incoming request, I need to log the request method, URL, headers, and body to a text file. So, I'll need to access these properties from the request object.\n\nHandling the request body might be a bit tricky because the request object only gives you access to the headers immediately, but the body is streamed in chunks. I need to collect these chunks and parse them if necessary, especially if the content-type is JSON.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the script can take command-line arguments for the port and the log file path. I can use the `minimist` package to parse these arguments easily.\n\nAdditionally, writing to a file in Node.js can be done using the `fs` module, but since requests can come in quickly, I should consider using asynchronous file writes to avoid blocking the event loop.\n\nLet me think about error handling. What if the specified port is already in use? Or if there's an error writing to the log file? I should handle these scenarios gracefully.\n\nAlso, for security reasons, I should probably limit the size of the request body to prevent DoS attacks.\n\nAlright, let's start by setting up the basic server structure.\n\nI'll create a new file, say `requestLogger.js`, and start by requiring the necessary modules.\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst minimist = require('minimist');\n```\n\nThen, I'll parse the command-line arguments using `minimist`. I need to define the default values and the options for the arguments.\n\n```javascript\nconst args = minimist(process.argv.slice(2), {\n  string: 'port',\n  string: 'output',\n  default: {\n    port: 3000,\n    output: 'requests.log'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHere, `port` and `output` are expected to be strings, and I've set defaults to port 3000 and `requests.log` as the log file.\n\nNow, I'll create the HTTP server.\n\n```javascript\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n  // Handle request and log details\n});\n```\n\nInside the request handler, I need to collect the request method, URL, headers, and body.\n\nFirst, the method and URL are straightforward:\n\n```javascript\nconst method = req.method;\nconst url = req.url;\nconst headers = req.headers;\n```\n\nFor the body, since it's streamed, I'll need to collect the chunks:\n\n```javascript\nlet body = [];\nreq.on('data', chunk => {\n  body.push(chunk);\n});\nreq.on('end', () => {\n  body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();\n  // Now I have the complete body\n});\n```\n\nI should also handle the case where the request has no body.\n\nOnce I have all the details, I need to log them to the specified file. I'll create a string with all the information and write it to the file.\n\nI should format the log entry nicely, maybe including a timestamp.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\nTimestamp: [timestamp]\nMethod: [method]\nURL: [url]\nHeaders: [headers JSON string]\nBody: [body]\n\n---\n```\n\nI'll use `fs.appendFile` to write to the log file asynchronously.\n\nBut, appending to a file for each request might not be the most efficient way, especially under heavy load. Maybe I should buffer the logs in memory and write them in batches or use a streaming approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use `fs.createWriteStream` in append mode to write logs directly without buffering.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nI can create a write stream at the beginning of the script:\n\n```javascript\nconst logStream = fs.createWriteStream(args.output, { flags: 'a' });\n```\n\nThen, in the request handler, when I have all the details, I can write to this stream.\n\nNow, putting it all together, here's a rough structure of the script:\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst minimist = require('minimist');\n\nconst args = minimist(process.argv.slice(2), {\n  string: 'port',\n  string: 'output',\n  default: {\n    port: 3000,\n    output: 'requests.log'\n  }\n});\n\nconst logStream = fs.createWriteStream(args.output, { flags: 'a' });\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n  const method = req.method;\n  const url = req.url;\n  const headers = req.headers;\n\n  let body = [];\n  req.on('data', chunk => {\n    body.push(chunk);\n  });\n  req.on('end', () => {\n    body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();\n    const logEntry = `\nTimestamp: ${new Date().toISOString()}\nMethod: ${method}\nURL: ${url}\nHeaders: ${JSON.stringify(headers, null, 2)}\nBody: ${body}\n\n---\n`;\n    logStream.write(logEntry);\n    res.end('Logged');\n  });\n});\n\nserver.listen(args.port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server listening on port ${args.port}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Now, I need to test this script to make sure it works as expected.\n\nI'll save this code in `requestLogger.js` and install the required packages using npm.\n\nFirst, I need to install `minimist`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install minimist\n```\n\nThen, I can run the script with custom port and output file:\n\n```bash\nnode requestLogger.js --port=3000 --output=requests.log\n```\n\nOr use default values:\n\n```bash\nnode requestLogger.js\n```\n\nI'll use tools like `curl` or Postman to send various types of requests to the server and check if the logs are being written correctly.\n\nFor example, using `curl`:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:3000/\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ -d '{\"key\":\"value\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```\n\nI should check different HTTP methods and different content-types to ensure that the body is being captured correctly.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that large request bodies are handled properly without crashing the server.\n\nMaybe I should add a limit to the request body size to prevent abuse.\n\nNode.js has the `http` module's `IncomingMessage` object, which emits a 'data' event for each chunk of the body. I can keep track of the total body size and abort the request if it exceeds a certain limit.\n\nI'll add a maximum body limit, say 1MB.\n\nHere's how I can implement that:\n\n```javascript\nconst MAX_BODY_SIZE = 1e6; // 1MB\n\nreq.on('data', chunk => {\n  body.push(chunk);\n  if (body.length > MAX_BODY_SIZE) {\n    req.destroy(new Error('Request body too large'));\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis way, if the body exceeds 1MB, the request is destroyed, and an error is emitted.\n\nI should also handle errors properly, like port already in use or errors writing to the log file.\n\nFor the server listening, I can add a catch for errors:\n\n```javascript\nserver.listen(args.port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server listening on port ${args.port}`);\n}).on('error', err => {\n  console.error(`Error starting server: ${err.message}`);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\nFor the log stream, I can listen for errors:\n\n```javascript\nlogStream.on('error', err => {\n  console.error(`Error writing to log file: ${err.message}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis way, any issues with writing to the file will be logged to the console.\n\nAnother consideration is handling different content-types, especially if the body is JSON. In the current implementation, the body is stored as a string, which should be fine since I'm just logging it.\n\nHowever, if I want to pretty-print JSON bodies, I could parse them and stringify them with indentation.\n\nBut that might not be necessary for a log file, and parsing could introduce errors if the body is not valid JSON.\n\nSo, I'll keep it as is, storing the body as a raw string.\n\nI should also think about handling binary bodies, like images or files. In such cases, logging the raw binary data to a text file might not be useful. Maybe I should base64 encode binary bodies before logging them.\n\nTo detect binary bodies, I can check the content-type header.\n\nHere's how I can modify the logEntry to handle binary data:\n\n```javascript\nlet bodyLog;\nif (headers['content-type'] && headers['content-type'].includes('application/json')) {\n  bodyLog = body;\n} else {\n  bodyLog = body.toString('base64');\n}\n\nconst logEntry = `\nTimestamp: ${new Date().toISOString()}\nMethod: ${method}\nURL: ${url}\nHeaders: ${JSON.stringify(headers, null, 2)}\nBody: ${bodyLog}\n\n---\n`;\n```\n\nThis way, non-JSON bodies are base64 encoded before logging, making the log file more readable and avoiding encoding issues.\n\nWait, but base64 encoding can make the log file quite large. Maybe I should only log a portion of the body if it's binary, or provide an option to log binary data in a separate file.\n\nThis might complicate things, so for now, I'll stick with logging the body as a string, and if it's binary, it might get logged in a way that's not very readable.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable for a log file, as the main purpose is to capture the data for debugging or analysis purposes.\n\nAnother thing to consider is privacy and security. Logging request bodies might include sensitive information like passwords or personal data. In a production environment, I need to ensure that these logs are handled securely and comply with data protection regulations.\n\nBut for this exercise, I'll assume that it's okay to log the entire body.\n\nI should also think about performance. Since the script is logging each request immediately, and using a write stream, it should perform well even under heavy load.\n\nHowever, if the log file becomes very large, it might be useful to rotate the logs, i.e., create a new log file after a certain size or time interval.\n\nNode.js has modules like `rotating-file-stream` that can handle log rotation.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll omit log rotation in this script.\n\nOne more thing: I need to make sure that the server responds to each request, even if it's just a simple \"Logged\" message.\n\nIn the current implementation, I'm calling `res.end('Logged')`, which is fine for this purpose.\n\nBut if I plan to use this script for testing or development, I might want to return more informative responses or handle different types of requests differently.\n\nFor now, keeping it simple is okay.\n\nI should also consider adding a way to gracefully shut down the server, maybe by listening for SIGINT signals and closing the log stream before exiting.\n\nHere's how I can do that:\n\n```javascript\nprocess.on('SIGINT', () => {\n  logStream.end(() => {\n    server.close(() => {\n      console.log('Server closed');\n      process.exit(0);\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis way, when the script receives a SIGINT (e.g., from pressing Ctrl+C), it will finish writing any remaining log data, close the server, and then exit.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered most of the aspects for this task.\n\nLet me summarize the steps:\n\n1. Parse command-line arguments for port and output file using `minimist`.\n\n2. Create an HTTP server that listens on the specified port.\n\n3. For each incoming request, capture the method, URL, headers, and body.\n\n4. Log these details to the specified output file, including a timestamp.\n\n5. Handle large request bodies by setting a maximum size limit.\n\n6. Handle errors gracefully, such as port already in use or errors writing to the log file.\n\n7. Provide a way to gracefully shut down the server.\n\nI'll now write the complete code with these considerations and test it thoroughly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Node.js script that listens for incoming HTTP requests and logs the request method, URL, headers, and body to a text file, follow these steps:\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst minimist = require('minimist');\n\n// Parse command-line arguments\nconst args = minimist(process.argv.slice(2), {\n  string: ['port', 'output'],\n  default: {\n    port: 3000,\n    output: 'requests.log'\n  }\n});\n\n// Create a write stream for logging\nconst logStream = fs.createWriteStream(args.output, { flags: 'a' });\n\n// Create HTTP server\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n  const method = req.method;\n  const url = req.url;\n  const headers = req.headers;\n\n  let body = [];\n  req.on('data', chunk => {\n    body.push(chunk);\n    if (body.length > MAX_BODY_SIZE) {\n      req.destroy(new Error('Request body too large'));\n    }\n  });\n  req.on('end', () => {\n    body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();\n    const logEntry = `\nTimestamp: ${new Date().toISOString()}\nMethod: ${method}\nURL: ${url}\nHeaders: ${JSON.stringify(headers, null, 2)}\nBody: ${body}\n\n---\n`;\n    logStream.write(logEntry);\n    res.end('Logged');\n  });\n});\n\n// Maximum request body size (1MB)\nconst MAX_BODY_SIZE = 1e6;\n\n// Start the server\nserver.listen(args.port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server listening on port ${args.port}`);\n}).on('error', err => {\n  console.error(`Error starting server: ${err.message}`);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n\n// Graceful shutdown\nprocess.on('SIGINT', () => {\n  logStream.end(() => {\n    server.close(() => {\n      console.log('Server closed');\n      process.exit(0);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n// Error handling for log stream\nlogStream.on('error', err => {\n  console.error(`Error writing to log file: ${err.message}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Command-line Arguments Parsing**:\n   - Use `minimist` to parse command-line options for specifying the port and output log file.\n\n2. **HTTP Server Setup**:\n   - Create an HTTP server using Node.js `http` module.\n   - For each request, capture the method, URL, headers, and body.\n\n3. **Request Body Handling**:\n   - Collect request data chunks and limit the body size to prevent abuse.\n   - Log request details including a timestamp to a specified log file using a write stream.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Handle errors during server startup and log writing.\n   - Ensure graceful shutdown of the server on receiving SIGINT signal.\n\n5. **Dependencies**:\n   - `minimist`: For parsing command-line options.
