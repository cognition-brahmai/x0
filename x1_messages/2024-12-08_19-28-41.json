        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to create a simple command-line calculator in C++ that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power operations. I need to make sure it's user-friendly and handles edge cases like division by zero.\n\nFirst, I'll start by including the necessary headers. I'll need `<iostream>` for input and output, `<cmath>` for the power function, and maybe `<limits>` to handle invalid inputs.\n\nNext, I'll plan the structure of the program. I think it's best to have a menu that displays the available operations, and then the user can select one by entering a corresponding number. After that, the user will input two numbers, and the program will perform the selected operation.\n\nI need to consider how to handle invalid inputs. For example, if the user enters a non-numeric value, or if they try to divide by zero. I should include error messages for these cases.\n\nFor the power operation, I'll use the `pow` function from `<cmath>`. But I should be careful with negative bases and fractional exponents, as that could lead to complex numbers, which I'm not handling here.\n\nAlso, I should think about looping the calculator so that after one operation, the user can choose to do another one without restarting the program.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline:\n\n1. Display a welcome message.\n\n2. Show a menu with operation choices:\n\n- 1. Addition\n\n- 2. Subtraction\n\n- 3. Multiplication\n\n- 4. Division\n\n- 5. Power\n\n- 6. Exit\n\n3. Prompt the user to enter their choice.\n\n4. Based on the choice, prompt for two numbers.\n\n5. Perform the operation and display the result.\n\n6. Ask if the user wants to perform another operation.\n\n7. If not, exit the program.\n\nI need to make sure that the program doesn't crash if the user enters something invalid, like letters instead of numbers.\n\nMaybe I'll use a loop that continues until the user decides to exit.\n\nLet me think about how to handle division by zero. If the user selects division and tries to divide by zero, I should display an error message like \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\" and prompt for new numbers or to choose a new operation.\n\nSimilarly, for the power operation, if the base is negative and the exponent is a fraction, I should handle it appropriately, maybe by displaying an error message about complex results.\n\nAlso, I should consider floating-point numbers, not just integers.\n\nI think I'll store the numbers as doubles to handle decimal points.\n\nLet me start writing some pseudocode.\n\n```\n\ninclude <iostream>\n\ninclude <cmath>\n\ninclude <limits>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\n    char continueCalc = 'y';\n\n    while (continueCalc == 'y' || continueCalc == 'Y') {\n\n        cout << \"Welcome to the calculator!\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"Please select an operation:\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"1.

Please select a valid operation.\" << endl;\n\n        }\n\n        cout << \"Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): \";\n\n        cin >> continueCalc;\n\n        if (cin.fail()) {\n\n            cin.clear();\n\n            cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Now, I need to think about how to handle invalid inputs, like if the user enters letters instead of numbers.\n\nI can add input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numbers. If not, I can display an error message and ask them to enter again.\n\nMaybe I'll create a function to get a valid double input.\n\nAlso, for the power operation, I need to handle cases where the base is negative and the exponent is not an integer, as that would result in a complex number, which I'm not dealing with here.\n\nLet me work on the input validation.\n\nI can use a loop to keep asking for input until a valid double is entered.\n\nHere's an example of how to get a valid double:\n\n```\n\ndouble getValidDouble(string prompt) {\n\n    double value;\n\n    while (true) {\n\n        cout << prompt;\n\n        cin >> value;\n\n        if (cin.fail()) {\n\n            cin.clear();\n\n            cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n            cout << \"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\" << endl;\n\n        } else {\n\n            cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n            return value;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI can use this function to get num1 and num2.\n\nAlso, for the power operation, I need to check if the base is negative and the exponent is not an integer.\n\nI can use the `floor` function to check if the exponent is an integer.\n\nIf the exponent is not an integer and the base is negative, I'll display an error message.\n\nOtherwise, I'll proceed with the power operation.\n\nLet me integrate this into the code.\n\nAlso, for the division operation, I need to handle division by zero.\n\nI already have a check for that.\n\nI should also make sure that after handling an error, the program doesn't proceed to calculate the result.\n\nI think it's handled in the switch case already.\n\nLet me think about the loop for continuing calculations.\n\nI have a while loop that continues as long as the user enters 'y' or 'Y'.\n\nAfter each calculation, it asks if the user wants to perform another calculation.\n\nIf the user enters 'n' or 'N', it should exit the loop and end the program.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user enters something other than 'y' or 'n', maybe by considering anything other than 'y' as a negative response.\n\nBut to make it more user-friendly, I can keep asking for a valid response until the user enters 'y' or 'n'.\n\nLet me adjust the continue calculation part.\n\nI can create a function to get the continue response.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\n\nchar getContinueResponse() {\n\n    char response;\n\n    while (true) {\n\n        cout << \"Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): \";\n\n        cin >> response;\n\n        if (response == 'y' || response == 'Y' || response == 'n' || response == 'N') {\n\n            return response;\n\n        } else {\n\n            cout << \"Invalid input. Please enter 'y' or 'n'.\" << endl;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, it ensures that only 'y', 'Y', 'n', or 'N' are accepted.\n\nNow, let's think about the overall structure.\n\nI can move the menu inside the while loop, so it displays repeatedly until the user decides to exit.\n\nI should also make sure to handle any cin failures outside of the switch case, perhaps by checking the state of cin after reading the choice.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Display welcome message.\n\n2. Start a loop that continues until the user doesn't want to perform another calculation.\n\na. Display menu.\n\nb. Get the operation choice from the user.\n\nc. Validate the choice.\n\nd. If the choice is to exit, break the loop.\n\ne. Otherwise, get the two numbers using the getValidDouble function.\n\nf. Perform the selected operation.\n\ng. Handle any edge cases, like division by zero or invalid power operations.\n\nh. Display the result.\n\ni. Ask if the user wants to perform another calculation.\n\n3. If the user doesn't want to continue, exit the program.\n\nI need to make sure that the program is robust and doesn't crash no matter what the user inputs.\n\nLet me consider some potential issues:\n\n- User enters non-numeric values for the operation choice.\n\n- User enters non-numeric values for the numbers.\n\n- User tries to divide by zero.\n\n- User tries to calculate the power with a negative base and non-integer exponent.\n\nI need to handle all these cases gracefully.\n\nFor the operation choice, I can read it as a string and then check if it's a valid digit before converting it to an integer.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that the user enters a valid integer for the choice, and handle invalid choices within the switch case.\n\nHowever, to make it more robust, I can read the choice as a string and handle parsing errors.\n\nBut to keep it relatively simple, I'll proceed with reading it as an integer and handle invalid choices in the default case of the switch statement.\n\nNow, let's think about the power operation in more detail.\n\nIf the base is negative and the exponent is not an integer, `pow` will return a domain error, which in C++ sets errno to EDOM.\n\nI can check errno after calling pow to see if an error occurred.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the exponent is an integer when the base is negative.\n\nTo check if a double is an integer, I can use the `floor` function and see if it's equal to the original number.\n\nFor example:\n\nif (num2 == floor(num2))\n\nThis would mean that the exponent is an integer.\n\nSo, for power operation:\n\n- If base < 0 and exponent is not an integer, display an error.\n\n- Else, calculate pow(base, exponent).\n\nI need to include `<cmath>` for pow and floor functions.\n\nAlso, I need to include `<cerrno>` to check errno, but perhaps checking if exponent is an integer is sufficient.\n\nLet me proceed with checking if the exponent is an integer when the base is negative.\n\nNow, let's think about the continue response.\n\nI can create a function to get the continue response, as I thought earlier.\n\nThis function will loop until it gets a 'y', 'Y', 'n', or 'N'.\n\nThen, based on the response, decide whether to continue or exit.\n\nI should also handle the case where the user might enter something else, like a number or a different letter, by prompting again.\n\nNow, let's consider writing the code with these considerations.\n\nI'll start by including the necessary headers.\n\nThen, define the getValidDouble function.\n\nAfter that, perhaps define the getContinueResponse function.\n\nThen, in the main function, have the while loop that continues based on the continue response.\n\nInside the loop, display the menu, get the choice, and proceed based on the choice.\n\nFor each operation, get the two numbers using getValidDouble, perform the operation, and handle any edge cases.\n\nFinally, ask for continue response.\n\nI need to make sure that after each input, I handle cin failures properly, by clearing the error state and ignoring the remaining input.\n\nLet me write some sample code.\n\nFirst, include the headers:\n\n```\n\ninclude <iostream>\n\ninclude <cmath>\n\ninclude <limits>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n```\n\nDefine getValidDouble function:\n\n```\n\ndouble getValidDouble(string prompt) {\n\n    double value;\n\n    while (true) {\n\n        cout << prompt;\n\n        cin >> value;\n\n        if (cin.fail()) {\n\n            cin.clear();\n\n            cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n            cout << \"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\" << endl;\n\n        } else {\n\n            cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n            return value;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nDefine getContinueResponse function:\n\n```\n\nchar getContinueResponse() {\n\n    char response;\n\n    while (true) {\n\n        cout << \"Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): \";\n\n        cin >> response;\n\n        if (response == 'y' || response == 'Y' || response == 'n' || response == 'N') {\n\n            return response;\n\n        } else {\n\n            cout << \"Invalid input. Please enter 'y' or 'n'.\" << endl;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNow, in the main function:\n\n```\n\nint main() {\n\n    char continueCalc = 'y';\n\n    while (continueCalc == 'y' || continueCalc == 'Y') {\n\n        cout << \"Welcome to the calculator!\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"Please select an operation:\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"1. Addition\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"2. Subtraction\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"3. Multiplication\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"4. Division\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"5. Power\" << endl;\n\n        cout << \"6. Exit\" << endl;\n\n        int choice;\n\n        cin >> choice;\n\n        if (cin.fail()) {\n\n            cin.clear();\n\n            cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n            cout << \"Invalid choice. Please select a valid operation.\" << endl;\n\n            continue;\n\n        }\n\n        switch(choice) {\n\n            case 1:\n\n                double num1 = getValidDouble(\"Enter first number: \");\n\n                double num2 = getValidDouble(\"Enter second number: \");\n\n                cout << \"Result: \" << num1 + num2 << endl;\n\n                break;\n\n            case 2:\n\n                double num1 = getValidDouble(\"Enter first number: \");\n\n                double num2 = getValidDouble(\"Enter second number: \");\n\n                cout << \"Result: \" << num1 - num2 << endl;\n\n                break;\n\n            case 3:\n\n                double num1 = getValidDouble(\"Enter first number: \");\n\n                double num2 = getValidDouble(\"Enter second number: \");\n\n                cout << \"Result: \" << num1 * num2 << endl;\n\n                break;\n\n            case 4:\n\n                double numerator = getValidDouble(\"Enter numerator: \");\n\n                double denominator = getValidDouble(\"Enter denominator: \");\n\n                if(denominator == 0) {\n\n                    cout << \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\" << endl;\n\n                } else {\n\n                    cout << \"Result: \" << numerator / denominator << endl;\n\n                }\n\n                break;\n\n            case 5:\n\n                double base = getValidDouble(\"Enter base: \");\n\n                double exponent = getValidDouble(\"Enter exponent: \");\n\n                if(base < 0 && exponent != floor(exponent)) {\n\n                    cout << \"Error: Result would be a complex number.\" << endl;\n\n                } else {\n\n                    cout << \"Result: \" << pow(base, exponent) << endl;\n\n                }\n\n                break;\n\n            case 6:\n\n                cout << \"Exiting the calculator.\" << endl;\n\n                return 0;\n\n            default:\n\n                cout << \"Invalid choice. Please select a valid operation.\" << endl;\n\n        }\n\n        continueCalc = getContinueResponse();\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis looks pretty good. I need to make sure that the getValidDouble function handles all kinds of invalid inputs correctly.\n\nAlso, in the division operation, I'm already handling the division by zero case.\n\nFor the power operation, I'm checking if the base is negative and the exponent is not an integer, and displaying an error message accordingly.\n\nI should also consider the case where the base is zero and the exponent is negative, which would be mathematically undefined.\n\nLet me add that to the power operation.\n\nIf base is zero and exponent is negative, it's equivalent to 1 / (0^(-exponent)), which is undefined.\n\nSo, I need to handle that case as well.\n\nI can add an additional check in the power operation:\n\nif (base == 0 && exponent < 0) {\n\n    cout << \"Error: Undefined operation (0 raised to a negative power).\" << endl;\n\n}\n\nOtherwise, proceed with the power calculation.\n\nLet me integrate that into the code.\n\nAlso, I should think about the precision of the output, especially for floating-point results.\n\nMaybe I can set the precision to a certain number of decimal places.\n\nFor example, using `cout.precision(2);` and `cout.fixed;`\n\nBut perhaps it's better to let the default precision handle it, or allow the user to choose the precision.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll stick with the default precision.\n\nNow, let's consider if there are any other edge cases I need to handle.\n\n- Very large exponents in the power operation could lead to overflow or underflow.\n\n- Negative exponents in other operations, but since they are handled as doubles, it should be fine.\n\n- Users might enter very large or very small numbers, but C++ doubles can handle a wide range.\n\nI think with the current implementation, the program is robust enough for basic calculations.\n\nLet me summarize the final code structure:\n\n- Include necessary headers: `<iostream>`, `<cmath>`, `<limits>`\n\n- Define `getValidDouble` function for input validation.\n\n- Define `getContinueResponse` function to get 'y' or 'n' response.\n\n- In `main`:\n\n- Use a while loop to continue calculations until the user decides to exit.\n\n- Display menu and get operation choice.\n\n- Validate the choice and perform the corresponding operation.\n\n- Handle edge cases like division by zero and invalid power operations.\n\n- Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.\n\nThis should cover all the requirements for a basic command-line calculator in C++.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in C++ that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power operations, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Include Necessary Headers:**\n   - `<iostream>` for input and output.\n   - `<cmath>` for mathematical functions like power.\n   - `<limits>` to handle invalid inputs.\n\n2. **Define Helper Functions:**\n   - `getValidDouble(string prompt)`: Ensures the user inputs a valid double value.\n   - `getContinueResponse()`: Asks the user if they want to perform another calculation.\n\n3. **Main Function:**\n   - Display a menu of operations.\n   - Based on user choice, perform the selected operation.\n   - Handle edge cases like division by zero and invalid power operations.\n   - Allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they decide to exit.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <limits>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ndouble getValidDouble(string prompt) {\n    double value;\n    while (true) {\n        cout << prompt;\n        cin >> value;\n        if (cin.fail()) {\n            cin.clear();\n            cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n            cout << \"Invalid input.

It handles invalid inputs by prompting the user again.\n   - `getContinueResponse()`: This function asks the user if they want to perform another calculation and ensures they input 'y' or 'n'.\n\n2. **Main Function:**\n   - A menu is displayed to the user listing the available operations.\n   - Based on the user's choice, the corresponding operation is performed.\n   - Input validation is handled using the helper functions to ensure the program doesn't crash due to invalid inputs.\n   - Edge cases like division by zero and invalid power operations are handled with appropriate error messages.\n   - The user can choose to perform multiple calculations until they decide to exit."
