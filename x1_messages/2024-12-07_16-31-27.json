        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The car rental company has a total of 30 cars in their fleet.\n\nFirst, they rent out 20% of their cars on Monday. So, I need to calculate 20% of 30 cars.\n\n20% of 30 is calculated as:\n(20/100) * 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 cars\n\nSo, on Monday, they rent out 6 cars.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are left after Monday, I subtract the rented cars from the total fleet.\n\n30 cars - 6 cars = 24 cars remaining\n\nNext, on Tuesday, they rent out 40% of the remaining cars. So, I need to calculate 40% of 24 cars.\n\n40% of 24 is calculated as:\n(40/100) * 24 = 0.4 * 24 = 9.6 cars\n\nSince the number of cars should be a whole number, I'll assume that they rent out 9 or 10 cars. But typically, in such problems, they expect you to deal with whole numbers, so maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, 40% of 24 is actually:\n\n0.4 * 24 = 9.6\n\nBut cars can't be fractioned, so perhaps the problem expects you to round it to the nearest whole number. Maybe they rent out 10 cars on Tuesday.\n\nBut to be precise, let's consider that they rent out 9 cars on Tuesday.\n\nSo, subtracting those 9 cars from the remaining 24 cars:\n\n24 - 9 = 15 cars left unrented\n\nAlternatively, if they rent out 10 cars on Tuesday:\n\n24 - 10 = 14 cars left unrented\n\nBut since 0.6 of a car is not possible, perhaps the problem needs to be approached differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the percentages are exact, and the number of cars rented is based on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fleet allows for fractional cars in calculations, but in reality, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the percentages.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nFirst, 20% of 30 cars is indeed 6 cars.\n\nThen, remaining cars are 30 - 6 = 24 cars.\n\nNow, 40% of 24 is 9.6 cars.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects you to consider that they can only rent whole cars, so they rent out 9 cars on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the number of cars left unrented is 24 - 9 = 15 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if they round up to 10 cars rented on Tuesday, then 24 - 10 = 14 cars left.\n\nBut I think rounding down to 9 cars is more appropriate since 9.6 is closer to 10, but in business, they might round down to avoid having fractional units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects you to consider that they can only rent whole cars, so they rent out 9 cars on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the final number of unrented cars is 15.\n\nWait, but 9.6 suggests that perhaps the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I need to consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the percentages are applied to the original number, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining cars after Monday are 24, and 40% of those are rented on Tuesday, which is 9.6 cars, but since we can't have fractioned cars, we need to decide how to proceed.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects you to consider that they rent out 10 cars on Tuesday, as 40% of 24 is 9.6, and they round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, 24 - 10 = 14 cars left unrented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they round down to 9 cars rented on Tuesday, resulting in 15 cars left unrented.\n\nTo be safe, I'll go with 15 cars left unrented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the rent out percentages sequentially.\n\nFirst, 20% of 30 cars are rented on Monday: 0.2 * 30 = 6 cars.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, they rent out 40% of the remaining cars.\n\nRemaining cars after Monday: 30 - 6 = 24 cars.\n\n40% of 24 is 9.6 cars.\n\nNow, since cars can't be fractioned, perhaps the problem expects you to consider that they rent out 10 cars on Tuesday, as 9.6 rounds up to 10.\n\nTherefore, total cars rented out: 6 on Monday + 10 on Tuesday = 16 cars.\n\nTotal cars left unrented: 30 - 16 = 14 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if they rent out 9 cars on Tuesday, total rented: 6 + 9 = 15 cars, and unrented: 15 cars.\n\nBut I think rounding up to 10 cars is more appropriate, leading to 14 unrented cars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to consider that they can only rent whole numbers of cars, so they rent out 9 cars on Tuesday, resulting in 15 unrented cars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they consider the 0.6 as a part of a car and round down to 9 cars.\n\nTherefore, 24 - 9 = 15 cars left unrented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 14 cars left unrented.\n\nBut to be precise, I think 15 cars is the correct number left unrented.\n\nTherefore, the number of cars left unrented after Tuesday is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
