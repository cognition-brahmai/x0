        "content": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. There's a box with red and blue balls, and if I pick two balls at random without replacement, the probability of getting one red and one blue is 2/5. I need to find out what the total number of balls in the box could be.\n\nFirst, I should probably define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\(r\\) be the number of red balls.\n\n- Let \\(b\\) be the number of blue balls.\n\n- So, the total number of balls is \\(r + b\\).\n\nNow, the problem is about picking two balls without replacement and getting one red and one blue. The probability of that happening is given as 2/5.\n\nI need to find possible values for \\(r + b\\), the total number of balls.\n\nAlright, let's think about how to calculate the probability of picking one red and one blue ball.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to approach this.\n\nFirst approach: Consider the sequences.\n\n- I can pick a red ball first and then a blue ball, or a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\n- So, the total probability is the sum of these two scenarios.\n\nThe probability of picking a red first is \\( \\frac{r}{r+b} \\), and then picking a blue is \\( \\frac{b}{r+b-1} \\).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue first is \\( \\frac{b}{r+b} \\), and then picking red is \\( \\frac{r}{r+b-1} \\).\n\nSo, the total probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{r+b} \\times \\frac{b}{r+b-1} + \\frac{b}{r+b} \\times \\frac{r}{r+b-1} = \\frac{2rb}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}\n\\]\n\nAnd this is equal to 2/5.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2rb}{(r+b)(r+b-1)} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this equation.\n\nFirst, I can divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{rb}{(r+b)(r+b-1)} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n5rb = (r + b)(r + b - 1)\n\\]\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n\\[\n5rb = r^2 + rb + rb + b^2 - r - b\n\\]\n\nWait, actually, let's be careful with the expansion.\n\n\\[\n(r + b)(r + b - 1) = (r + b)(r + b) - (r + b) = (r + b)^2 - (r + b)\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n5rb = (r + b)^2 - (r + b)\n\\]\n\nLet me denote \\( t = r + b \\), the total number of balls.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n5rb = t^2 - t\n\\]\n\nBut I have \\( rb \\) in terms of \\( t \\), and I need to relate \\( r \\) and \\( b \\) somehow.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( r + b = t \\), and \\( rb = ? \\), maybe I can think of \\( rb \\) in terms of \\( t \\).\n\nWait, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n5rb = t^2 - t\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nrb = \\frac{t^2 - t}{5}\n\\]\n\nNow, since \\( r \\) and \\( b \\) are integers (number of balls), \\( rb \\) must be an integer, so \\( t^2 - t \\) must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo, \\( t(t - 1) \\) must be divisible by 5.\n\nThat means either \\( t \\) is divisible by 5 or \\( t - 1 \\) is divisible by 5.\n\nSo, \\( t \\) is a multiple of 5 or one more than a multiple of 5.\n\nSo, possible values for \\( t \\) are 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 16, etc.\n\nNow, for each possible \\( t \\), I can find corresponding \\( r \\) and \\( b \\) that satisfy the equation \\( rb = \\frac{t^2 - t}{5} \\).\n\nLet's try with \\( t = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nrb = \\frac{25 - 5}{5} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r + b = 5 \\) and \\( rb = 4 \\).\n\nI need two numbers that add up to 5 and multiply to 4. Let's see:\n\nPossible pairs: (1,4) and (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) would mean both are red or both are blue, but the problem mentions both red and blue balls.\n\nSo, (1,4) is possible: one red and four blue, or one blue and four red.\n\nLet's check if this satisfies the original probability.\n\nIf \\( r = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), total balls \\( t = 5 \\).\n\nProbability of one red and one blue:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{4}{4} + \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 1 + \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( r = 4 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), it would be the same.\n\nSo, \\( t = 5 \\) is a possible total number of balls.\n\nNow, let's try \\( t = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\nrb = \\frac{36 - 6}{5} = \\frac{30}{5} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r + b = 6 \\) and \\( rb = 6 \\).\n\nPossible pairs: (2,3) and (3,2).\n\nBoth are valid: two red and three blue, or three red and two blue.\n\nLet's check the probability for \\( r = 2 \\), \\( b = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{3}{6} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{6}{30} = \\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSimilarly for \\( r = 3 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), it would be the same.\n\nSo, \\( t = 6 \\) is also a possible total.\n\nNext, \\( t = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\nrb = \\frac{100 - 10}{5} = \\frac{90}{5} = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r + b = 10 \\) and \\( rb = 18 \\).\n\nPossible integer solutions: let's see.\n\nWe need two numbers that add up to 10 and multiply to 18.\n\nPossible pairs: (2,9), but 2 + 9 = 11, not 10.\n\n(3,6): 3 + 6 = 9, not 10.\n\n(4,5): 4 + 5 = 9, not 10.\n\nWait, none of these add up to 10 and multiply to 18.\n\nWait, maybe (6,3): 6 + 3 = 9, not 10.\n\nWait, there are no integer solutions for \\( r \\) and \\( b \\) that satisfy \\( r + b = 10 \\) and \\( rb = 18 \\).\n\nSo, \\( t = 10 \\) is not possible.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me check again.\n\n\\( r + b = 10 \\)\n\n\\( rb = 18 \\)\n\nSo, possible pairs:\n\nLet me solve the quadratic equation:\n\n\\( r(10 - r) = 18 \\)\n\n\\[\n10r - r^2 = 18 \\\\\nr^2 - 10r + 18 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 72}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{28}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm 2\\sqrt{7}}{2} = 5 \\pm \\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r = 5 + \\sqrt{7} \\) or \\( r = 5 - \\sqrt{7} \\), which are not integers.\n\nTherefore, there are no integer solutions for \\( r \\) and \\( b \\) when \\( t = 10 \\).\n\nSo, \\( t = 10 \\) is not possible.\n\nNext, \\( t = 11 \\):\n\n\\[\nrb = \\frac{121 - 11}{5} = \\frac{110}{5} = 22\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r + b = 11 \\), \\( rb = 22 \\).\n\nPossible integer solutions:\n\nLet's solve:\n\n\\( r(11 - r) = 22 \\)\n\n\\[\n11r - r^2 = 22 \\\\\nr^2 - 11r + 22 = 0\n\\]\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{121 - 88}}{2} = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{2}\n\\]\n\nAgain, not integers.\n\nSo, \\( t = 11 \\) is not possible.\n\nNext, \\( t = 15 \\):\n\n\\[\nrb = \\frac{225 - 15}{5} = \\frac{210}{5} = 42\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r + b = 15 \\), \\( rb = 42 \\).\n\nPossible integer solutions:\n\nSolve:\n\n\\( r(15 - r) = 42 \\)\n\n\\[\n15r - r^2 = 42 \\\\\nr^2 - 15r + 42 = 0\n\\]\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{225 - 168}}{2} = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{57}}{2}\n\\]\n\nNot integers.\n\nSo, \\( t = 15 \\) is not possible.\n\nNext, \\( t = 16 \\):\n\n\\[\nrb = \\frac{256 - 16}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r + b = 16 \\), \\( rb = 48 \\).\n\nSolve:\n\n\\( r(16 - r) = 48 \\)\n\n\\[\n16r - r^2 = 48 \\\\\nr^2 - 16r + 48 = 0\n\\]\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{16 \\pm \\sqrt{256 - 192}}{2} = \\frac{16 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2} = \\frac{16 \\pm 8}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r = \\frac{16 + 8}{2} = 12 \\) or \\( r = \\frac{16 - 8}{2} = 4 \\)\n\nThus, \\( r = 12 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), or \\( r = 4 \\), \\( b = 12 \\).\n\nBoth are integer solutions.\n\nLet's check the probability for \\( r = 12 \\), \\( b = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{16} \\times \\frac{4}{15} + \\frac{4}{16} \\times \\frac{12}{15} = \\frac{48}{240} + \\frac{48}{240} = \\frac{96}{240} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSimilarly for \\( r = 4 \\), \\( b = 12 \\), it would be the same.\n\nSo, \\( t = 16 \\) is also a possible total number of balls.\n\nContinuing this way, we can find more possible values of \\( t \\), but I think I've demonstrated the method.\n\nSo far, possible total numbers of balls are 5, 6, and 16.\n\nI can see a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a general solution.\n\nLet me go back to the equation:\n\n\\[\n5rb = t^2 - t\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( r + b = t \\), we can think of \\( r \\) and \\( b \\) as roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - tx + rb = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - tx + \\frac{t^2 - t}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nFor \\( r \\) and \\( b \\) to be integers, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square.\n\nDiscriminant \\( d \\):\n\n\\[\nd = t^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{t^2 - t}{5} = t^2 - \\frac{4t^2 - 4t}{5} = \\frac{5t^2 - 4t^2 + 4t}{5} = \\frac{t^2 + 4t}{5} = \\frac{t(t + 4)}{5}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( d \\) to be a perfect square, \\( \\frac{t(t + 4)}{5} \\) must be a perfect square.\n\nMoreover, since \\( t(t - 1) \\) is divisible by 5, as established earlier, \\( t \\) is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 5.\n\nNow, to find integer solutions for \\( t \\), we can look for \\( t \\) such that \\( \\frac{t(t + 4)}{5} \\) is a perfect square.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can look for \\( t \\) values that satisfy this condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to parametrize the solutions.\n\nLet me consider that \\( t(t + 4) \\) must be 5 times a perfect square.\n\nSo, \\( t(t + 4) = 5k^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nThis is an Diophantine equation, and solving it would give us the possible values of \\( t \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for patterns in the values of \\( t \\) that work.\n\nFrom earlier, \\( t = 5, 6, 16 \\) work.\n\nLet's see the differences:\n\n- From 5 to 6: difference of 1\n\n- From 6 to 16: difference of 10\n\n- Maybe the next one would be 16 + 35 = 51, but let's check.\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern in the differences: 1, 10, 35, etc., which are triangular numbers or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that finding all possible \\( t \\) requires solving the Diophantine equation \\( t(t + 4) = 5k^2 \\), which might be an elliptic curve or have some other structure.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, perhaps finding a few small solutions is sufficient, especially since the problem asks for \"what could be the total number of balls in the box,\" implying that there might be multiple possible answers.\n\nSo, based on the above, possible total numbers of balls are 5, 6, and 16.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- When \\( t = 5 \\), \\( r = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\) or \\( r = 4 \\), \\( b = 1 \\)\n\n- When \\( t = 6 \\), \\( r = 2 \\), \\( b = 3 \\) or \\( r = 3 \\), \\( b = 2 \\)\n\n- When \\( t = 16 \\), \\( r = 4 \\), \\( b = 12 \\) or \\( r = 12 \\), \\( b = 4 \\)\n\nThese are some possible total numbers of balls in the box that satisfy the given probability condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{5, 6, 16}"
