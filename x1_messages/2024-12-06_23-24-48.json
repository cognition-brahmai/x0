        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 2500 units in 8 hours. I need to find out how many units it will produce in 15 hours if it keeps up the same production rate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the production rate per hour. So, if it produces 2500 units in 8 hours, then the hourly production rate is 2500 divided by 8. Let me calculate that.\n\n2500 divided by 8 is 312.5 units per hour. So, the factory produces 312.5 units each hour.\n\nNow, if it operates for 15 hours at this rate, I can find the total production by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours.\n\nSo, 312.5 units per hour times 15 hours equals... let's see, 312.5 times 15.\n\nI can calculate this as 312.5 times 10, which is 3125, and then 312.5 times 5, which is 1562.5, and then add them together.\n\n3125 plus 1562.5 is 4687.5.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 4687.5 units in 15 hours.\n\nBut since we're dealing with units of product, which are probably whole items, I might need to round this to a whole number. Depending on the context, it could be acceptable to have a half unit, but typically, products are whole items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production rate allows for half units, or maybe it's a continuous process where fractions make sense.\n\nEither way, based on the calculation, it's 4687.5 units.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 8 hours produce 2500 units, then 15 hours will produce x units.\n\nSo, we can set up a proportion: 8 hours is to 2500 units as 15 hours is to x units.\n\nThat is, 8/2500 = 15/x.\n\nWait, no, that's inverted. Actually, it should be 8 hours : 2500 units = 15 hours : x units.\n\nIn terms of fractions, that's 8/2500 = 15/x.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Actually, if you think about it, more hours should produce more units, so x should be larger than 2500, which aligns with our earlier calculation of 4687.5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as a unit rate again.\n\nThe unit rate is 2500 units / 8 hours = 312.5 units per hour.\n\nThen, for 15 hours, it's 312.5 * 15 = 4687.5 units.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the proportion method correctly.\n\nIf 8 hours produce 2500 units, then 1 hour produces 2500/8 = 312.5 units.\n\nTherefore, 15 hours produce 312.5 * 15 = 4687.5 units.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up the proportion as 8 hours is to 15 hours as 2500 units is to x units.\n\nThat is, 8/15 = 2500/x.\n\nWait, no. That's not correct. Because 8 hours corresponds to 2500 units, and 15 hours corresponds to x units.\n\nSo, the correct proportion is 8/2500 = 15/x.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, it should be 8 hours : 2500 units = 15 hours : x units.\n\nIn terms of fractions, that's 8/2500 = 15/x.\n\nBut if I cross-multiply, I get 8x = 2500 * 15.\n\nThen, x = (2500 * 15) / 8.\n\nCalculating that: 2500 * 15 = 37,500.\n\nThen, 37,500 divided by 8 is 4,687.5.\n\nSo, again, I get x = 4,687.5 units.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of direct proportion.\n\nSince production is directly proportional to time, x = (2500 / 8) * 15 = 312.5 * 15 = 4,687.5.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 4,687.5 units in 15 hours.\n\nIf we need to consider only whole units, we might round this to 4,688 units, assuming we round up.\n\nAlternatively, if the context allows for fractional units, 4,687.5 is acceptable.\n\nBut in most manufacturing scenarios, units are whole items, so rounding to 4,688 makes sense.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, like chemical processes or continuous production, fractions might be acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with 4,687.5 units.\n\nTo summarize, the factory produces 2500 units in 8 hours, which is a rate of 312.5 units per hour.\n\nOperating at this rate for 15 hours results in 4,687.5 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4687.5} \\]"
