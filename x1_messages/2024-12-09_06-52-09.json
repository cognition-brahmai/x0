        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that John reads a certain number of pages each day from Monday to Friday, and each day he reads 10 more pages than the day before. Starting with Monday, he read 35 pages.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the number of pages he reads each day:\n\n- Monday: 35 pages\n\n- Tuesday: 35 + 10 = 45 pages\n\n- Wednesday: 45 + 10 = 55 pages\n\n- Thursday: 55 + 10 = 65 pages\n\n- Friday: 65 + 10 = 75 pages\n\nNow, to find the total pages he read from Monday to Friday, I need to add up all these pages.\n\nSo, total pages = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday\n\nThat is, total pages = 35 + 45 + 55 + 65 + 75\n\nLet me add these step by step:\n\n35 + 45 = 80\n\n80 + 55 = 135\n\n135 + 65 = 200\n\n200 + 75 = 275\n\nTherefore, John read a total of 275 pages from Monday to Friday.\n\nWait a minute, is there a smarter way to do this without adding each day's pages one by one? Since he reads 10 more pages each day, it's like an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 10.\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the first n terms can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = n/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nIn this case, n is the number of days, which is 5 (Monday to Friday).\n\nFirst term is 35 pages (Monday), and the last term is 75 pages (Friday).\n\nSo, sum = 5/2 * (35 + 75) = 5/2 * 110 = (5 * 110)/2 = 550/2 = 275 pages.\n\nThat matches the total I got earlier by adding each day's pages separately.\n\nIt's good to see that both methods give the same result. So, John read a total of 275 pages from Monday to Friday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{275} \\]"
