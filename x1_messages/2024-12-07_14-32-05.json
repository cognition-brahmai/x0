        "content": "So I have this problem here: a car can travel 350 miles on a full tank of gas, and the tank holds 14 gallons. I need to find out how many gallons of gas the car consumes per mile. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"consumes per mile\" means. It's asking for the amount of gas used for each mile traveled. So, essentially, it's the gallons per mile rate.\n\nI know that the car can go 350 miles on 14 gallons of gas. So, if I want to find out how many gallons are used per mile, I should probably divide the gallons by the miles.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nGallons per mile = gallons / miles\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nGallons per mile = 14 gallons / 350 miles\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n14 divided by 350. That's the same as 14/350.\n\nI can simplify that fraction. Both 14 and 350 are divisible by 14.\n\n14 \u00f7 14 = 1\n\n350 \u00f7 14 = 25\n\nSo, 14/350 simplifies to 1/25.\n\nTherefore, the car consumes 1/25 gallons per mile.\n\nWait a minute, but it's often more common to talk about miles per gallon, not gallons per mile. But the question specifically asks for gallons per mile.\n\nStill, I might want to double-check if I'm approaching this correctly.\n\nLet me think differently. If the car travels 350 miles on 14 gallons, then the miles per gallon would be:\n\nMiles per gallon = miles / gallons = 350 miles / 14 gallons\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n350 \u00f7 14 = 25 miles per gallon.\n\nSo, the car gets 25 miles per gallon.\n\nBut the question is asking for gallons per mile. So, if it's 25 miles per gallon, then gallons per mile would be the reciprocal of that.\n\nGallons per mile = 1 / (miles per gallon) = 1 / 25 = 0.04 gallons per mile.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 1/25 gallons per mile, which is the same as 0.04 gallons per mile.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me confirm with another approach. If the tank holds 14 gallons and allows the car to travel 350 miles, then for each mile, the car uses up 14 gallons / 350 miles = 1/25 gallons per mile.\n\nAlternatively, if the car travels 25 miles per gallon, then per mile, it uses 1/25 gallons.\n\nEverything points to 1/25 gallons per mile.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. Gallons per mile should have units of gallons/mile.\n\nIn the first method, gallons divided by miles gives gallons/mile.\n\nIn the second method, the reciprocal of miles per gallon gives gallons per mile.\n\nBoth methods agree on the units and the value.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nSo, the car consumes 1/25 gallons per mile, which is 0.04 gallons per mile.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{25}\\ \\text{gallons per mile}} \\]"
