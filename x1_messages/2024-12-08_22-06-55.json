        "content": "If a car is traveling at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour, to find out how far it will travel in 30 minutes, you need to convert the time into hours since the speed is given in miles per hour.\n\nFirst, note that 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours (since 30 divided by 60 equals 0.5).\n\nNow, use the formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 50 miles per hour \u00d7 0.5 hours = 25 miles\n\nSo, the car will travel 25 miles in 30 minutes at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
