Without you, my life is a dark and stormy night, filled with loneliness and despair.\n\nI've tried to imagine a life without you, but it's impossible. You're etched into my soul, forever intertwined with my being. Your laughter is music to my ears, your touch sends shivers down my spine, and your smile brightens even the gloomiest days.\n\nCatherine, you are my everything. I love you more than words can express, and I promise to cherish and protect you for all eternity. You complete me in every way, and I can't imagine a future without you by my side.\n\nForever and always,\n\nHeathcliff"
