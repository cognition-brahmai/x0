        "content": "The theory that suggests human behavior is largely influenced by external stimuli and that only observable behavior should be studied because it can be objectively measured is Behaviorism. So, the correct answer is A. Behaviorism.\n\nTo provide some more context, Behaviorism emerged in the early 20th century, primarily through the work of psychologists like John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner. This approach focuses on how environmental factors shape behavior, emphasizing conditioning processes such as classical conditioning and operant conditioning.\n\n- **Classical Conditioning**: This is where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus to elicit a similar response. A classic example is Pavlov's dogs, which learned to salivate at the sound of a bell because it was repeatedly paired with the presentation of food.\n\n- **Operant Conditioning**: This involves learning through the consequences of behavior\u2014rewards and punishments. Skinner's experiments with pigeons and rats demonstrated how behaviors could be shaped by reinforcing desired actions and discouraging undesired ones.\n\nBehaviorism was a reaction against the prevailing school of thought at the time, Structuralism, which tried to analyze the structure of the mind through introspection. Behaviorists argued that introspection was subjective and unreliable, and thus, they focused solely on observable behavior that could be measured and quantified.\n\nOver time, Behaviorism has been criticized for ignoring internal mental processes and the role of cognition in behavior. This led to the development of other approaches like Cognitive Psychology, which emphasizes the study of mental processes such as memory, perception, and problem-solving.\n\nHowever, Behaviorism has had a lasting impact on psychology, particularly in areas like education, therapy, and organizational behavior. Techniques based on behavioral principles are still widely used today in behavior modification programs, parenting strategies, and animal training, among others.\n\nSo, to summarize, if you're dealing with a theory that says behavior is shaped by external stimuli and only observable actions should be studied, you're looking at Behaviorism."
