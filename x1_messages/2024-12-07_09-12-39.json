Here are four essential oils commonly used in aromatherapy, along with their purported benefits for mental and physical well-being:\n\n1. **Lavender Essential Oil:**\n   - **Mental Benefits:** Lavender is renowned for its calming and soothing properties. It is often used to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. The scent can help promote relaxation and improve mood.\n   - **Physical Benefits:** Lavender oil is also beneficial for physical health. It can help alleviate headaches and migraines, improve sleep quality, and even aid in wound healing due to its antiseptic properties.\n\n2. **Peppermint Essential Oil:**\n   - **Mental Benefits:** Peppermint oil is known for its invigorating and refreshing aroma, which can help enhance mental clarity and focus. It is often used to combat fatigue and boost energy levels.\n   - **Physical Benefits:** Physically, peppermint oil can relieve muscle pain and tension, particularly in the neck and shoulders. It is also effective in alleviating digestive issues such as nausea, indigestion, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\n3. **Eucalyptus Essential Oil:**\n   - **Mental Benefits:** Eucalyptus oil has a fresh, cleansing scent that can help improve mental alertness and concentration. It is also believed to have a calming effect on the mind.\n   - **Physical Benefits:** One of the primary uses of eucalyptus oil is for respiratory health.
