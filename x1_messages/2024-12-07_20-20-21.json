        "content": "So I need to calculate the surface area and volume of a sphere with a radius of 7 cm. I remember there are specific formulas for spheres, but I might need to brush up on them. Let's start with the surface area.\n\nFirst, the formula for the surface area (A) of a sphere is:\n\nA = 4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.14159\n\n- r is the radius of the sphere\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 7 cm, I can plug this value into the formula.\n\nSo,\n\nA = 4 * \u03c0 * (7 cm)\u00b2\n\nFirst, I need to square the radius:\n\n(7 cm)\u00b2 = 49 cm\u00b2\n\nNow, multiply that by \u03c0:\n\n49 cm\u00b2 * \u03c0 \u2248 49 cm\u00b2 * 3.14159 \u2248 153.938 cm\u00b2\n\nThen, multiply by 4:\n\n4 * 153.938 cm\u00b2 \u2248 615.752 cm\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 615.752 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, let's calculate the volume (V) of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3\n\nAgain, r is the radius, which is 7 cm.\n\nSo,\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (7 cm)\u00b3\n\nFirst, cube the radius:\n\n(7 cm)\u00b3 = 343 cm\u00b3\n\nNow, multiply that by \u03c0:\n\n343 cm\u00b3 * \u03c0 \u2248 343 cm\u00b3 * 3.14159 \u2248 1077.534 cm\u00b3\n\nThen, multiply by 4/3:\n\n(4/3) * 1077.534 cm\u00b3 \u2248 1.33333 * 1077.534 cm\u00b3 \u2248 1436.712 cm\u00b3\n\nTherefore, the volume of the sphere is approximately 1436.712 cm\u00b3.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Surface Area: approximately 615.752 cm\u00b2\n\n- Volume: approximately 1436.712 cm\u00b3\n\nI should also consider significant figures. The given radius is 7 cm, which has one significant figure, but since \u03c0 is a constant and r is exact for the purpose of this calculation, I can keep more decimal places in my answer. However, for practical purposes, rounding to two decimal places, as I did, is usually acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, if more precision is needed, I could use a more accurate value of \u03c0, but for most applications, 3.14159 is sufficient.\n\nThat's it! I've calculated both the surface area and volume of the sphere with a radius of 7 cm.\n\n**Final Answers**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{615.752 \\text{ cm}^2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1436.712 \\text{ cm}^3} \\]"
