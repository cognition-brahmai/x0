        "content": "Parsing a CSV file and converting it into JSON format is a common task in data processing. Python provides several libraries to handle this efficiently. In this script, we'll use the `csv` module to read the CSV file and the `json` module to write the output in JSON format.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Read the CSV File:** Use the `csv` module to read the CSV file. This module allows us to handle CSV data easily, providing a reader object that iterates over lines in the CSV file.\n\n2. **Convert CSV Data to a List of Dictionaries:** Each row in the CSV file will be converted into a dictionary where the keys are the column headers. This list of dictionaries will represent the entire CSV data.\n\n3. **Write the Data to a JSON File:** Use the `json` module to convert the list of dictionaries into a JSON formatted string and write it to a file.\n\n## Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport json\n\ndef csv_to_json(csv_file_path, json_file_path):\n    # Read the CSV file\n    with open(csv_file_path, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as csv_file:\n        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)\n        \n        # Convert CSV data to a list of dictionaries\n        data = [row for row in csv_reader]\n    \n    # Write the data to a JSON file\n    with open(json_file_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as json_file:\n        json.dump(data, json_file, indent=4)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    csv_path = 'input.csv'  # Replace with your CSV file path\n    json_path = 'output.json'  # Replace with your desired JSON file path\n    csv_to_json(csv_path, json_path)\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the CSV File:**\n   - We open the CSV file in read mode.\n   - `csv.DictReader` is used to read the CSV file. It automatically reads the first row as column headers and uses them to map the values in each subsequent row to a dictionary.\n\n2. **Converting to JSON:**\n   - We collect all rows from the CSV file into a list of dictionaries.\n   - We then open a JSON file in write mode and use `json.dump` to write the list of dictionaries to the file in JSON format. The `indent=4` parameter is used to format the JSON output for better readability.\n\n3. **Running the Script:**\n   - The script is executed from the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, which allows it to be run as a standalone script.\n   - Replace `'input.csv'` and `'output.json'` with the paths to your CSV file and the desired output JSON file, respectively.\n\nThis script provides a simple and efficient way to convert CSV data to JSON format, making it easy to work with the data in various applications."
