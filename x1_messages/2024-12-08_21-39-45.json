Swaying trees provide shelter from scorching sunlight, as students spend summers swimming in sparkling seas or sipping smoothies in shaded spots. Sunny days spark spontaneity, encouraging souls to seek adventure and savour life's simple pleasures. Summer is a season of satisfaction and solace, a time when nature's splendour shines most brightly."
