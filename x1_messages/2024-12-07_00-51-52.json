        "content": "To create a Java program that reads a CSV file containing student information (name, age, grade), sorts them by age in ascending order, and writes the sorted list to a new CSV file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Reading the CSV file**: Use a library like OpenCSV to read the CSV file easily.\n2. **Storing the data**: Store the student data in a list of custom objects.\n3. **Sorting the data**: Sort the list based on the age attribute.\n4. **Writing to a new CSV file**: Use OpenCSV again to write the sorted list to a new CSV file.\n\nFirst, make sure to include the OpenCSV library in your project. If you're using Maven, add this dependency to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.opencsv</groupId>\n    <artifactId>opencsv</artifactId>\n    <version>5.5.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nHere's a complete Java program that accomplishes the task:\n\n```java\nimport com.opencsv.CSVReader;\nimport com.opencsv.CSVWriter;\n\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nclass Student {\n    String name;\n    int age;\n    String grade;\n\n    public Student(String name, int age, String grade) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.grade = grade;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return name + \",\" + age + \",\" + grade;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SortStudentsByAge {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String inputCsv = \"students.csv\";\n        String outputCsv = \"sorted_students.csv\";\n\n        List<Student> students = readStudents(inputCsv);\n        Collections.sort(students, (s1, s2) -> Integer.compare(s1.age, s2.age));\n        writeStudents(outputCsv, students);\n    }\n\n    private static List<Student> readStudents(String csvFile) {\n        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();\n        try (CSVReader reader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(csvFile))) {\n            String[] line;\n            while ((line = reader.readNext()) != null) {\n                if (line.length == 3) {\n                    String name = line[0];\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(line[1]);\n                    String grade = line[2];\n                    students.add(new Student(name, age, grade));\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        return students;\n    }\n\n    private static void writeStudents(String csvFile, List<Student> students) {\n        try (CSVWriter writer = new CSVWriter(new FileWriter(csvFile))) {\n            for (Student student : students) {\n                writer.writeNext(student.toString().split(\",\"));\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Student Class**: A simple class to represent a student with name, age, and grade attributes.\n2. **readStudents Method**: Reads the CSV file using OpenCSV's `CSVReader`, parses each line into a `Student` object, and adds it to a list.\n3. **writeStudents Method**: Writes the list of `Student` objects to a new CSV file using OpenCSV's `CSVWriter`.\n4. **main Method**: Reads the students from the input CSV, sorts them by age using `Collections.sort`, and writes the sorted list to the output CSV.\n\nMake sure your input CSV file (`students.csv`) is formatted correctly with headers or without, depending on your needs. This example assumes that each line has three columns: name, age, and grade, separated by commas."
