        "content": "So we have this bridge-crossing problem with four people: A, B, C, and D, who take 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes to cross the bridge, respectively. The bridge can only hold two people at a time, and they need to use a single torch, meaning that whenever two people cross together, they have to move at the slower person's pace. The goal is to get all four across the bridge in the fastest time possible.\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding the constraints and what we need to optimize. The main constraints are:\n\n1. Only two people can cross at a time.\n\n2. The torch must be used for any crossing.\n\n3. When two people cross together, their crossing time is determined by the slower one.\n\nOur objective is to minimize the total time for all four to cross.\n\nFirst, let's consider the basic approach: having someone act as a ferry to bring the torch back after each crossing. This person would be making multiple trips across the bridge, both forwards and backwards.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to have the fastest person, A (1 minute), be the one making the return trips with the torch, because they can do so quickly.\n\nLet's outline a potential plan:\n\n1. A and B cross together to the other side. Time taken: 2 minutes (since B is slower).\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\n3. C and D cross together to the other side. Time taken: 10 minutes (since D is slower).\n\n4. B returns with the torch. Time taken: 2 minutes.\n\n5. A and B cross again. Time taken: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nHmm, is there a way to do better than 17 minutes?\n\nLet's think about it differently. Maybe instead of A always bringing the torch back, sometimes another faster person could make the return trip.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can arrange the crossings so that fewer return trips are needed.\n\nLet's consider another approach:\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes.\n\nThat's worse than the previous plan.\n\nWait, maybe I should have C and D cross together earlier.\n\nLet's try this sequence:\n\n1. A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes again.\n\nStill not better than the first plan.\n\nLet me try having C and D cross together without A escorting them.\n\nHere's another plan:\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. B returns with the torch. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n3. C and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and B cross together again. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nSame as the first plan.\n\nIs there a way to reduce the time further?\n\nLet me think outside the box. Maybe have someone other than A make some return trips.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange for someone to make a round trip in a clever way.\n\nWait, what if after C and D cross, B makes the return trip instead of A?\n\nLet's try that:\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. C and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n4. B returns with the torch. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n5. A and B cross together again. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nStill the same.\n\nWait, what if instead of A returning after the first crossing, B returns?\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. B returns with the torch. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n3. A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 20 minutes.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes.\n\nStill 19 minutes.\n\nHmm.\n\nIs there a way to have C and D cross earlier without having A make too many return trips?\n\nWait, perhaps have C and D cross first, then A and B cross, and see what happens.\n\nLet's try:\n\n1. C and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n2. C returns with the torch. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n3. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. C and D cross together again. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 28 minutes.\n\nThat's worse.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2.

Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes.\n\nStill 20 minutes.\n\nNot better than the initial 17 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have someone make a round trip while others are crossing.\n\nIs there a way to overlap some of these trips?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have someone cross, then have another pair cross, and then have someone come back.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose A and B cross first, then A returns, then C and D cross, and then B returns to bring the torch back, and finally A and B cross again.\n\nThat's what we did earlier, totaling 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to make B's return trip unnecessary or to combine some steps?\n\nWait, what if after A and B cross, B returns with the torch, then C and D cross, and then A returns with the torch to bring B across again.\n\nWait, that's similar to the earlier plan.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. B returns with the torch. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n3. C and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and B cross together again. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIs there a way to save time on the return trips?\n\nWait, perhaps have A and B cross, then A returns, then A and C cross, then A returns again, and finally A and D cross.\n\nThat would be:\n\n1. A and B cross. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. A returns. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. A and C cross. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n4. A returns. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and D cross. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes.\n\nStill 19 minutes.\n\nNot better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have A and D cross first.\n\nWait, that might not be efficient because D is the slowest.\n\nLet's try:\n\n1. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5.

A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. B and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n4. C returns with the torch. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n5.

A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 19 minutes.\n\nStill 19 minutes.\n\nNot better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have A and C cross, then B and D cross, and see what happens.\n\nWait, but then who brings the torch back?\n\nLet's try:\n\n1.

Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIs there a way to make this faster?\n\nWait, perhaps by optimizing the return trips.\n\nIf A makes the return trips, each return trip takes 1 minute, which is faster than B's 2 minutes.\n\nSo, having A make the return trips seems optimal.\n\nBut in the initial plan, A makes two return trips: one after A and B cross, and another after C and D cross.\n\nTotal time is 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to reduce the number of return trips or make them faster?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have A and C cross together, then A returns, then A and D cross, then A returns, and finally A and B cross.\n\nBut that totals 19 minutes, which is worse.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have B make one return trip and A make another to save time.\n\nLet's try:\n\n1.

C returns with the torch. Time: 5 minutes.\n\nTotal: 21 minutes.\n\n5. A and C cross together again. Time: 5 minutes.\n\nTotal: 26 minutes.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have A and D cross together, then D returns with the torch, then A and C cross together, and so on.\n\nWait, but D is the slowest, so having D make a return trip would be inefficient.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n2. D returns with the torch. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 20 minutes.\n\nAt this point, it's already worse than the earlier plans.\n\nSo, that's not a good approach.\n\nIs there another way to optimize this?\n\nPerhaps by having A and B cross together, then A returns, then C and D cross together, and then B returns to bring the torch back for A.\n\nWait, that's similar to what we've already done.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1.

B returns with the torch. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 15 minutes.\n\n5. A and B cross together again. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 17 minutes.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIs there a way to make B's return trip faster or to eliminate it somehow?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have A and C cross together, then C returns with the torch, then A and D cross together, and finally A returns to bring B across.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\n2. C returns with the torch. Time: 5 minutes.\n\nTotal: 10 minutes.\n\n3. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 20 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 21 minutes.\n\n5. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 23 minutes.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nHmm.\n\nIs there a way to have C and D cross together without A making multiple return trips?\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe have A and B cross together, then B returns with the torch, then A and C cross together, then A returns with the torch, and finally A and D cross together.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. B returns with the torch. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 4 minutes.\n\n3. A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\nTotal: 9 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 10 minutes.\n\n5. A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 20 minutes.\n\nStill 20 minutes.\n\nNot better than the initial 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to make this faster?\n\nWait, perhaps if after A and B cross, A returns, then C and D cross together, and then while C and D are crossing, B starts crossing back.\n\nBut the bridge can only hold two people at a time, and they need the torch.\n\nI think that approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have A and B cross together, then A returns, then C and D cross together, and then while C and D are crossing, B starts crossing back.\n\nAgain, not feasible due to the bridge's constraints.\n\nIs there a way to have overlapping crossings to save time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have A and B cross together, then A returns, then A and C cross together, and then while A and C are crossing, B starts crossing back.\n\nNo, that won't work because the bridge can only hold two people at a time.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have someone start crossing back while others are crossing.\n\nBut given the constraints, I don't think that's possible.\n\nPerhaps the initial plan of 17 minutes is the fastest possible.\n\nLet me see if there's a more optimized way.\n\nSuppose we have A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nThen A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\nThen C and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nThen A returns with the torch again. Time: 1 minute.\n\nFinally, A and B cross together again. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nWait, in the previous calculations, I had the total as 17 minutes, but adding these up gives 16 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated earlier.\n\nLet me add them again: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 16 minutes is the fastest time.\n\nWait, but I recall that the classic solution to this problem is 17 minutes.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check another way.\n\nSuppose A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nA returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\nC and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nB returns with the torch. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nA and B cross together again. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nWait, so in the previous calculation where I got 16 minutes, perhaps there's an overlap or mistake in the timing.\n\nLet me think carefully.\n\nWhen A and B cross first, it takes 2 minutes.\n\nThen A returns, taking 1 minute.\n\nSo far, 3 minutes.\n\nThen C and D cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nSo, from the start, 13 minutes have passed.\n\nThen A returns again, taking 1 minute, totaling 14 minutes.\n\nFinally, A and B cross together again, taking 2 minutes, totaling 16 minutes.\n\nWait, but in reality, when C and D are crossing, it takes 10 minutes, and during that time, A is returning with the torch.\n\nBut A can't be returning while C and D are crossing; the bridge can only hold two people at a time, and they need the torch.\n\nSo, the return trip by A must happen after C and D have crossed.\n\nTherefore, the total time is indeed 16 minutes.\n\nBut I'm confused because I recall the solution being 17 minutes.\n\nLet me check online to confirm.\n\n[Simulates checking online]\n\nWait, I can't actually check online, but according to standard solutions to this problem, the minimal time is 17 minutes.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf A and B cross first, taking 2 minutes.\n\nA returns, taking 1 minute.\n\nC and D cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nNow, at this point, the torch is on the other side with C and D.\n\nSomeone needs to bring it back for A and B to cross again.\n\nSo, either A or B has to return with the torch.\n\nIf A returns, taking 1 minute, then A and B cross again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if B returns instead of A, taking 2 minutes, then A and B cross again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nSo, the faster option is to have A make the return trip, totaling 16 minutes.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a reason why it can't be less than 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a constraint that I'm missing that prevents the total time from being 16 minutes?\n\nLet me consider the sequence again.\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. C and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\n4. A returns with the torch again. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. A and B cross together again. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if B returns instead of A after C and D have crossed, the total time would be 17 minutes.\n\nSo, the minimal time should be 16 minutes.\n\nBut according to standard solutions, it's 17 minutes.\n\nMaybe there's a flaw in my reasoning.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose that after C and D have crossed, A returns with the torch.\n\nBut during the time C and D are crossing (10 minutes), A is returning with the torch (1 minute).\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nThe return trip by A can't happen simultaneously with C and D's crossing.\n\nSo, A must wait on the other side until C and D have finished crossing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, after A and B have crossed (2 minutes), A returns (1 minute), total 3 minutes.\n\nThen C and D cross together (10 minutes), starting at time 3 and finishing at time 13.\n\nThen A returns again with the torch, starting at time 13, finishing at time 14.\n\nFinally, A and B cross together again, starting at time 14, finishing at time 16.\n\nSo, the total time is indeed 16 minutes.\n\nBut according to standard solutions, it should be 17 minutes.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the standard solution, or maybe I'm missing a constraint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the torch needs to be brought back immediately after each crossing, without overlapping.\n\nIn that case, after C and D cross at time 13, then A returns with the torch, taking another 1 minute, totaling 14 minutes.\n\nThen A and B cross again, taking 2 minutes, totaling 16 minutes.\n\nI think 16 minutes is the correct minimal time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a rule that the torch must be used for return trips as well, but in all the descriptions I've seen, only forward trips require the torch.\n\nWait, no, both forward and return trips require the torch.\n\nTherefore, the person returning must have the torch with them.\n\nGiven that, my earlier plan seems valid.\n\nHowever, perhaps the standard solution is different.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose we have A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nThen B returns with the torch. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 4 minutes.\n\nThen A and C cross together. Time: 5 minutes.\n\nTotal: 9 minutes.\n\nThen A returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\nTotal: 10 minutes.\n\nThen A and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nTotal: 20 minutes.\n\nThis totals 20 minutes, which is worse than 16 minutes.\n\nSo, 16 minutes seems better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a lower bound on the total time based on the individual crossing times.\n\nLet's consider the total time must be at least the time for the slowest individual to cross, which is 10 minutes.\n\nBut clearly, we can do better than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total time must account for at least three return trips, each taking at least 1 minute.\n\nBut in the 16-minute plan, there are only two return trips by A, totaling 2 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to mathematically determine the minimal possible time.\n\nLet's consider that in total, we have to account for the crossing times of all individuals, given the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the sum of the crossing times, but that doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps think in terms of graph theory, where each state represents who is on which side of the bridge.\n\nBut that might be too complex for now.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps 16 minutes is the minimal possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 17 minutes is the standard answer because of some oversight in my calculation.\n\nLet me check another way.\n\nSuppose we have A and B cross together. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nA returns with the torch. Time: 1 minute.\n\nC and D cross together. Time: 10 minutes.\n\nA returns with the torch again. Time: 1 minute.\n\nA and B cross together again. Time: 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 16 minutes.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a safety constraint that no two people can start crossing at the same time or something, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nGiven that, I think the minimal time is 16 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 16 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
