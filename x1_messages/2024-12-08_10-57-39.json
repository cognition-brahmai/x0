        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. You pick one ball, note its color, and put it back before picking another ball. You want to know the probability that both balls picked were red.\n\nFirst, since you're putting the ball back after the first pick, the total number of balls remains the same for both picks. That means each pick is an independent event.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first pick is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/8.\n\nSince you're putting the ball back, the probability of picking a red ball on the second pick is also 5/8.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening\u2014picking a red ball first AND picking a red ball second\u2014you multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the probability is (5/8) * (5/8) = 25/64.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked were red is 25/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
