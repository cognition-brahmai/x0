        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. The company has an annual budget of $1,200,000 for employee salaries and there are 50 employees. To find the average salary per employee, I think I just need to divide the total budget by the number of employees. So, that would be $1,200,000 divided by 50.\n\nLet me do the math: 1,200,000 divided by 50. Well, 50 times 24,000 is 1,200,000. So, the average salary per employee is $24,000.\n\nNow, there's an additional part to this question. It says that the CEO's salary is $300,000, and I need to find the average salary for the remaining employees. Okay, so if the CEO makes $300,000, then the total budget for the other employees would be the total budget minus the CEO's salary.\n\nSo, $1,200,000 minus $300,000 is $900,000. Now, there are 50 employees in total, but if one is the CEO, then there are 49 remaining employees.\n\nSo, to find the average salary for these remaining employees, I divide $900,000 by 49.\n\nLet me calculate that: 900,000 divided by 49.\n\nHmm, 49 times 18,367.347... wait, let me use a calculator for this.\n\n900,000 divided by 49 equals approximately 18,367.34.\n\nSo, the average salary for the remaining employees is about $18,367.35.\n\nBut let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total budget is $1,200,000 for 50 employees.\n\nAverage salary = total budget / number of employees = 1,200,000 / 50 = $24,000. That seems correct.\n\nThen, total budget minus CEO's salary: 1,200,000 - 300,000 = $900,000.\n\nNumber of remaining employees: 50 - 1 = 49.\n\nAverage salary for remaining employees = 900,000 / 49.\n\nLet me confirm the division: 49 times 18,367.34 is indeed 900,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the average salary per employee is $24,000, and the average salary for the remaining employees after accounting for the CEO's salary is approximately $18,367.35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe average salary per employee is \\boxed{24000}, and the average salary for the remaining employees is \\boxed{18367.35}."
