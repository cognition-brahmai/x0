        "content": "I believe you're referring to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, that theorem is about the existence of roots for non-constant polynomial equations over the complex numbers, and while it has profound implications in algebra, it's not specifically about algebraic integers.\n\nGiven that you mentioned algebraic integers and that there are several proofs, including one by Dedekind, and it's associated with a prominent French mathematician, I think you might be thinking of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebraic Number Theory, or perhaps a specific theorem within algebraic number theory.\n\nAlgebraic integers are a key concept in algebraic number theory, which is a branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures, number fields, and their properties. Prominent French mathematicians like Dedekind, \u00c9variste Galois, and others have made significant contributions to this field.\n\nOne fundamental theorem in algebraic number theory is the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, which establishes a connection between field extensions and group theory. However, this theorem is more about the symmetry of field extensions rather than specifically about algebraic integers.\n\nAnother important theorem is Dedekind's Theorem on the factorization of prime ideals in algebraic number fields. This theorem is crucial in understanding how prime numbers behave in extensions of the integers, which is a central topic in algebraic number theory.\n\nAlternatively, you might be thinking of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely factored into prime numbers. However, this theorem is more basic and applies to the integers, not specifically to algebraic integers.\n\nGiven the mention of Dedekind and algebraic integers, perhaps you're referring to a theorem about the unique factorization of ideals in algebraic number fields, which is a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to more general number fields. Dedekind made significant contributions to this area, introducing the concept of ideals to restore unique factorization in rings of algebraic integers where it might fail for elements.\n\nThis theorem is often referred to as the Unique Factorization Theorem for Ideals, and it's a cornerstone of algebraic number theory. It states that in the ring of integers of an algebraic number field, every ideal can be uniquely factored into a product of prime ideals.\n\nNow, considering that you mentioned it's associated with a prominent French mathematician, Dedekind was German, so perhaps the French mathematician you have in mind is someone else. Joseph-Louis Lagrange, \u00c9variste Galois, and Jean-Pierre Serre are some prominent French mathematicians who have contributed to algebra and number theory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps you're thinking of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials, which states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials. This theorem has connections to algebraic integers through Galois theory and the study of polynomial equations.\n\nAnother possibility is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebraic Number Theory, which might be a colloquial term for several key results in the field, such as the finiteness of the class number or the unit theorem.\n\nGiven the clues provided, I'm going to take a guess that you're referring to the Unique Factorization Theorem for Ideals in algebraic number fields, which is a fundamental result in algebraic number theory, and it has proofs by Dedekind and other mathematicians. This theorem is indeed associated with prominent French mathematicians who have contributed to the field.\n\nSo, to answer your question: It's the Fundamental Theorem of Algebraic Number Theory, specifically regarding the unique factorization of ideals in algebraic number fields."
