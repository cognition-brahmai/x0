        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a school election with three categories of votes: votes for candidate A, votes for candidate B, and then some that were invalid or blank. The percentages given are 55% for A, 35% for B, and 10% for the invalid or blank votes. The total number of votes cast is 800. We need to find out how many more votes candidate A received compared to candidate B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these percentages represent. The percentages are parts of the total votes cast, which is 800. So, to find out how many votes each candidate received, I can calculate the corresponding percentage of the total votes.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of votes for candidate A. Since A received 55% of the votes, I can find this by calculating 55% of 800.\n\nSimilarly, for candidate B, who received 35% of the votes, I'll calculate 35% of 800.\n\nOnce I have the number of votes for both A and B, I can subtract the number of votes for B from the number of votes for A to find out how many more votes A received than B.\n\nAlso, there's a mention of invalid or blank votes accounting for 10% of the total votes. Although this information isn't directly needed to answer the question about the difference in votes between A and B, it's good to verify that the percentages add up correctly.\n\nLet's check: 55% for A + 35% for B + 10% invalid or blank = 100%. That checks out, so the percentages are correctly accounted for.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the calculations.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of votes for candidate A:\n\nVotes for A = 55% of 800\n\nTo calculate 55% of 800, I can use the formula:\n\nVotes for A = (55/100) * 800\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n55 divided by 100 is 0.55.\n\nThen, 0.55 multiplied by 800 is:\n\n0.55 * 800 = 440\n\nSo, candidate A received 440 votes.\n\nNext, calculate the number of votes for candidate B:\n\nVotes for B = 35% of 800\n\nUsing the same approach:\n\nVotes for B = (35/100) * 800\n\n35 divided by 100 is 0.35.\n\nThen, 0.35 multiplied by 800 is:\n\n0.35 * 800 = 280\n\nSo, candidate B received 280 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes candidate A received than candidate B, I subtract the votes for B from the votes for A:\n\nDifference = Votes for A - Votes for B\n\nDifference = 440 - 280 = 160\n\nTherefore, candidate A received 160 more votes than candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nVotes for A = 55% of 800 = 0.55 * 800 = 440\n\nVotes for B = 35% of 800 = 0.35 * 800 = 280\n\nDifference = 440 - 280 = 160\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the difference in percentages between A and B and then apply that to the total number of votes.\n\nThe difference in percentages between A and B is 55% - 35% = 20%.\n\nSo, 20% of the total votes is the difference in votes between A and B.\n\nTherefore, difference in votes = 20% of 800\n\nCalculating that:\n\n20% of 800 = (20/100) * 800 = 0.2 * 800 = 160\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation, which is a good sign that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the difference in percentages is 20%, and applying that directly to the total votes gives the difference in votes.\n\nThis cross-verification reinforces that the answer is indeed 160 votes.\n\nSo, candidate A received 160 more votes than candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
