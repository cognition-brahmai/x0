        "content": "Let's see. The factory originally produces 150 widgets per hour. They're increasing production by 20%. So first, I need to figure out what 20% of 150 is.\n\n20% of 150 should be calculated as 0.20 times 150, which is 30. So, the production increases by 30 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, adding that to the original production: 150 plus 30 equals 180 widgets per hour.\n\nThey work a 10-hour workday, so to find out the total production for the day, I need to multiply the hourly production by the number of hours worked.\n\nThat would be 180 widgets per hour times 10 hours, which equals 1,800 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nOriginal production: 150 widgets per hour.\n\nIncrease: 20% of 150 is indeed 30.\n\nNew production rate: 150 + 30 = 180 widgets per hour.\n\nOver 10 hours: 180 times 10 equals 1,800.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a 20% increase, so the new production is 120% of the original production.\n\nTo find 120% of 150, I can calculate 1.20 times 150, which is also 180 widgets per hour.\n\nThen, 180 times 10 equals 1,800.\n\nEither way, I end up with the same number, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1800} \\]"
