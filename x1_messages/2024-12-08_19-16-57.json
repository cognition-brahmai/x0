        "content": "Let's see. So, we have three villagers: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each of them is either a truth-teller or a liar. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, and liars always lie. We have their statements:\n\n- Alice says, \"Bob is a liar.\"\n\n- Bob says, \"Carol is a liar.\"\n\n- Carol says, \"Alice and Bob are both liars.\"\n\nI need to figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying based on these statements.\n\nFirst, let's consider Alice's statement: \"Bob is a liar.\"\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, then her statement is true, which means Bob is a liar.\n\nIf Alice is a liar, then her statement is false, which means Bob is not a liar, so Bob is a truth-teller.\n\nSo, depending on whether Alice is a truth-teller or a liar, Bob is a liar or a truth-teller, respectively.\n\nNext, Bob says, \"Carol is a liar.\"\n\nIf Bob is a truth-teller, then Carol is a liar.\n\nIf Bob is a liar, then Carol is not a liar, so Carol is a truth-teller.\n\nSimilarly, Carol says, \"Alice and Bob are both liars.\"\n\nIf Carol is a truth-teller, then both Alice and Bob are liars.\n\nIf Carol is a liar, then it's not the case that both Alice and Bob are liars, which means at least one of them is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's try to put this all together.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Alice is a truth-teller.\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, then Bob is a liar (according to Alice's statement).\n\nIf Bob is a liar, then Carol is not a liar (according to Bob's statement), so Carol is a truth-teller.\n\nNow, if Carol is a truth-teller, then both Alice and Bob are liars (according to Carol's statement). But we already have Alice as a truth-teller, which contradicts Carol's statement that both are liars. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nSo, Alice cannot be a truth-teller. Therefore, Alice must be a liar.\n\nIf Alice is a liar, then her statement \"Bob is a liar\" is false, which means Bob is not a liar, so Bob is a truth-teller.\n\nNow, since Bob is a truth-teller, his statement \"Carol is a liar\" is true, so Carol is a liar.\n\nIf Carol is a liar, then her statement \"Alice and Bob are both liars\" is false. We already know Alice is a liar and Bob is a truth-teller, so indeed, they are not both liars. This matches with Carol being a liar.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- Alice: liar\n\n- Bob: truth-teller\n\n- Carol: liar\n\nThis seems consistent with all the statements made.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check.\n\nIf Alice is a liar, then Bob is not a liar, so Bob is a truth-teller.\n\nIf Bob is a truth-teller, then Carol is a liar.\n\nIf Carol is a liar, then it's not true that both Alice and Bob are liars, which is correct because Bob is a truth-teller.\n\nEverything seems to align properly.\n\nI don't think there are any other possibilities here. This appears to be the only consistent scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice and Carol are liars, and Bob is a truth-teller.}} \\]"
