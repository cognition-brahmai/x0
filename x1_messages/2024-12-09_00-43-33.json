        "content": "Yes, chalk outlines are commonly used in crime scene investigations to mark the position of a body or other important evidence on the ground. This helps investigators to document the exact location of the body or evidence and to preserve the scene for further analysis. The chalk used for this purpose is specially formulated to be easily removed and not to damage the surface it is applied to."
