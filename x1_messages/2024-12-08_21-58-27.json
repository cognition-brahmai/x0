        "content": "So you've got this problem: you flip a coin 3 times, and you want to know the probability of getting heads all three times. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand that each coin flip is an independent event. That means the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the outcomes of the others. So, whether you get heads or tails on the first flip, it doesn't change the probabilities for the second and third flips.\n\nNow, for a fair coin, the probability of getting heads in a single flip is 1/2, or 0.5. Since the flips are independent, to find the probability of getting heads in all three flips, you multiply the probabilities of getting heads on each individual flip.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\nOr, in decimal form, that's 0.125, which is equivalent to 12.5%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times. Each flip has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for three flips, there are 2^3 = 8 possible sequences:\n\n1. HHH\n\n2. HHT\n\n3. HTH\n\n4. HTT\n\n5. THH\n\n6. THT\n\n7. TTH\n\n8. TTT\n\nOut of these eight equally likely outcomes, only one sequence corresponds to getting heads all three times (HHH). Therefore, the probability is 1 out of 8, or 1/8.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the probability would be the same for getting tails all three times (TTT), or any other specific sequence, like heads followed by tails followed by heads (HTH), because each sequence is equally likely.\n\nSo, to summarize, the probability of getting heads in all three flips of a fair coin is 1/8, or 12.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
