        "content": "To calculate how many miles a person walks in a year based on taking 10,000 steps per day with a stride length of 2.5 feet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate daily distance in feet:**\n   - Steps per day: 10,000\n   - Stride length: 2.5 feet\n   - Daily distance in feet = Steps per day \u00d7 Stride length\n   - Daily distance in feet = 10,000 \u00d7 2.5 = 25,000 feet\n\n2. **Convert daily distance to miles:**\n   - There are 5,280 feet in a mile.\n   - Daily distance in miles = Daily distance in feet \u00f7 5,280\n   - Daily distance in miles = 25,000 \u00f7 5,280 \u2248 4.7348 miles\n\n3. **Calculate annual distance:**\n   - Assuming 365 days in a year:\n   - Annual distance in miles = Daily distance in miles \u00d7 365\n   - Annual distance in miles \u2248 4.7348 \u00d7 365 \u2248 1,728.52 miles\n\nTherefore, a person who takes 10,000 steps per day with a stride length of 2.5 feet walks approximately 1,728.52 miles in a year.\n\n**Note:** This calculation doesn't account for leap years or variations in daily step counts or stride lengths."
