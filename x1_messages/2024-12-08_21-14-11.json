You want to know how much money you'll have after two years, assuming the interest is compounded annually. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what compound interest means. When interest is compounded annually, it means that the interest you earn each year is added to your principal, and the next year's interest is calculated on this new amount, not just the original deposit.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\times (1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{n \\times t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\( P = \\$2,000 \\)\n\n- \\( r = 5\\% = 0.05 \\)\n\n- \\( n = 1 \\) (since the interest is compounded annually)\n\n- \\( t = 2 \\) years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 2000 \\times (1 + \\frac{0.05}{1})^{1 \\times 2} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 2000 \\times (1 + 0.05)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 2000 \\times (1.05)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 2000 \\times 1.1025 \\]\n\n\\[ A = \\$2,205 \\]\n\nSo, after two years, you would have \\$2,205 in your account.\n\nTo understand this step by step:\n\n1. In the first year, you earn 5% interest on your \\$2,000 deposit.\n\n\\[ \\text{Interest for first year} = 2000 \\times 0.05 = \\$100 \\]\n\nSo, at the end of the first year, your account balance is:\n\n\\[ 2000 + 100 = \\$2,100 \\]\n\n2. In the second year, you earn 5% interest on the new balance of \\$2,100.\n\n\\[ \\text{Interest for second year} = 2100 \\times 0.05 = \\$105 \\]\n\nSo, at the end of the second year, your account balance is:\n\n\\[ 2100 + 105 = \\$2,205 \\]\n\nThis matches the amount we calculated using the compound interest formula.\n\nIt's worth noting that if the interest was simple interest, you would earn the same amount of interest each year based only on the original principal. In that case, you would earn \\$100 each year, and after two years, you would have \\$2,200. But since it's compounded annually, you earn interest on the interest from the previous year, which adds up to \\$2,205.\n\nAlso, if the compounding frequency was different, say quarterly or monthly, the amount would be slightly different because interest would be compounded more frequently. But in this scenario, since it's annually, we stick with the annual compounding formula.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how compound interest works and how to calculate the future value of your deposit.
