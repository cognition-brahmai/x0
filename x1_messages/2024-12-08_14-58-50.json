        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in the class, and each student gets either a red or blue sticker. The ratio of red to blue stickers is 2:3. I need to find out how many students received a red sticker.\n\nFirst, I understand that the ratio 2:3 means that for every 2 red stickers, there are 3 blue stickers. So, the total parts of the ratio are 2 + 3 = 5 parts.\n\nSince there are 30 students in total, each part of the ratio represents 30 \u00f7 5 = 6 students.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who received red stickers is 2 parts \u00d7 6 students per part = 12 students.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who received blue stickers is 3 parts \u00d7 6 students per part = 18 students.\n\nTo check, 12 + 18 = 30, which matches the total number of students.\n\nSo, the answer is 12 students received red stickers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
