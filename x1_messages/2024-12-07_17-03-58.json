Today, we have an absolute legend joining us. He's the fastest man on the planet, holding multiple world records, and he's here to share his incredible journey with us. Please welcome the one and only, Usain Bolt!\n\n**[Audience cheers and applauds as Usain Bolt walks onto the stage, waving and smiling. He takes a seat next to Ellen.]**\n\n**Ellen:** Usain, it's so great to have you here! I've been a huge fan for years. Your speed is just mind-blowing.\n\n**Usain Bolt:** Thank you, Ellen. It's an honor to be here.\n\n**Ellen:** So, let's start at the beginning. Where did your love for running come from? Did you always know you were special?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** Hmm, well, I grew up in Jamaica, and athletics is a big part of our culture there. My dad was into sports, and he used to take me to track meets when I was little. I guess I just fell in love with the feeling of speeding down the track. And yeah, I think deep down, even as a kid, I knew I had something special.\n\n**Ellen:** That's amazing. And you've certainly proven that over the years. You've broken so many records, but which race stands out as your favorite memory?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** Oh, that's a tough one because I have so many great memories. But if I had to pick one, it would probably be the 2008 Beijing Olympics. That was my first Olympic gold in the 100 meters, and it really launched my career onto another level. The energy in that stadium was electric.\n\n**Ellen:** I remember watching that race. It was unbelievable. You crossed the finish line and looked back to see how much ahead you were. That's when you did your signature pose, right?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** (laughs) Yeah, the \"To Di World\" pose. I just wanted to express my dominance and share my joy with everyone. It's become a symbol of my career, and I love that people recognize it.\n\n**Ellen:** It definitely is iconic. Now, aside from your incredible speed, you're also known for your charisma and sense of fun. Do you think that helps you perform better?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** Absolutely. I believe in enjoying what you do. If you're having fun, it shows in your performance. Plus, laughter and positivity can reduce stress, which is important in high-pressure situations like Olympic finals.\n\n**Ellen:** That's so true. Now, switching gears a bit, you've also dabbled in football, playing for clubs like Manchester United and Central Coast Mariners. How was that experience?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** It was a completely different challenge. Football requires a different set of skills, and I had to work really hard to adapt. I loved the team aspect and the strategy involved. It was a great learning experience, even though it wasn't my primary sport.\n\n**Ellen:** Well, maybe we'll see you back on the football field someday. Now, you're also involved in various charitable endeavors. Can you tell us about some of the causes you support?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** Definitely. I'm very passionate about giving back, especially in my home country of Jamaica. I've established the Usain Bolt Foundation, which focuses on education and athletics for underprivileged youth. We provide scholarships, build sports facilities, and promote healthy lifestyles.\n\n**Ellen:** That's wonderful. It's great to see athletes using their platforms for positive change. Now, for our audience at home, what advice do you have for young athletes who look up to you?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** My advice would be to believe in yourself and never give up on your dreams. Hard work and dedication are key. Also, always remember to enjoy the journey because that's what makes it worthwhile.\n\n**Ellen:** Absolutely. Now, before we let you go, we have a little game planned. Since you're known for your speed, we thought it would be fun to see how you stack up against some of our cast members in a mini race. Are you up for it?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** (laughs) Oh, absolutely! Bring it on.\n\n**Ellen:** Perfect. Let's get ready for some fun. Our production team has set up a short sprint course right here on the stage. You'll be racing against Portia de Rossi, who's known for her sense of humor but maybe not for her speed.\n\n**Portia de Rossi:** (enters stage, smiling) Hey, I might not be as fast as Usain, but I've got spirit on my side!\n\n**Usain Bolt:** (laughs) Good luck, Portia!\n\n**Ellen:** The rules are simple: on my mark, you both run to the finish line. No cheating, no faking injuries. Ready? On your marks, get set... go!\n\n**[Both Usain and Portia start running. Usain easily sprints ahead and crosses the finish line first, while Portia finishes shortly after, smiling and laughing.]**\n\n**Ellen:** (laughs) Well, Usain, looks like you still have it!\n\n**Usain Bolt:** (jokingly) I try my best!\n\n**Ellen:** Portia, how was that?\n\n**Portia:** It was a lot of fun! Usain is way faster than I am, but it was a great experience.\n\n**Ellen:** Thanks for participating, Portia. Now, Usain, before you go, do you have any upcoming projects or events you'd like to share with our audience?\n\n**Usain Bolt:** Yeah, actually, I'm working on expanding my foundation and planning some new initiatives. Also, I'm exploring opportunities in entertainment and business. So, lots of exciting things coming up.\n\n**Ellen:** We can't wait to see what you achieve next. Thank you so much for being here today, Usain. It's been an absolute pleasure.\n\n**Usain Bolt:** Thank you, Ellen. It's been great being here.\n\n**[Audience applauds as Usain Bolt waves and exits the stage.]**\n\n**Ellen:** Don't forget to catch our next show, same time, same place. Until then, remember to live life with passion and enjoy every moment. Bye everyone!\n\n**[OUTRO MUSIC PLAYS AS THE SHOW SIGNS OFF]**"
