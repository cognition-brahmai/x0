        "content": "The Shakespearean play that features the characters Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, and the three witches is \"Macbeth.\" This tragedy is one of Shakespeare's shortest plays but is renowned for its exploration of themes such as ambition, guilt, and the corrupting influence of power. The play tells the story of Macbeth, a Scottish nobleman who receives a prophecy from three witches that he will become king. Driven by his ambition and encouraged by his manipulative wife, Lady Macbeth, he commits regicide to fulfill the prophecy. The play delves into the psychological turmoil that follows these actions, leading to further bloodshed and ultimately, the downfall of Macbeth and his regime."
