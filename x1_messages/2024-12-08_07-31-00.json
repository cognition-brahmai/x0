        "content": "So the car can travel 100 miles on a full tank of gas. Currently, it has used 3/4 of its gas. I need to find out how many more miles it can travel before running out of gas.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much gas is left in the tank. If the car has used 3/4 of its gas, then the remaining gas is 1 minus 3/4, which is 1/4 of the tank.\n\nSince a full tank allows the car to travel 100 miles, then 1/4 of the tank should allow the car to travel 1/4 of 100 miles.\n\nSo, I can calculate it as:\n\nRemaining gas = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4\n\nMiles per 1/4 tank = 100 miles * 1/4 = 25 miles\n\nTherefore, the car can travel 25 more miles before running out of gas.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the miles per gallon or something like that? But the problem doesn't provide information about the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon, so maybe sticking with the tank fractions is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it, 3/4 of the gas has been used, so the car has already traveled 3/4 of 100 miles, which is 75 miles. Then, with the remaining 1/4 tank, it should be able to travel the remaining 25 miles.\n\nBut actually, that's not quite right. The car can travel 100 miles on a full tank, regardless of how much gas has been used. The distance traveled isn't directly proportional to the gas used if the car's fuel efficiency changes, but assuming the car's fuel efficiency is constant, then yes, 3/4 of the gas should have been used to travel 75 miles, leaving 25 miles for the remaining 1/4 tank.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify anything about changing fuel efficiency, so I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to determine the car's fuel efficiency. If a full tank allows 100 miles, and assuming a full tank is, say, X gallons, then the car's fuel efficiency is 100 miles per X gallons, or 100/X mpg.\n\nBut without knowing X, this might not help directly. Maybe I can avoid calculating X.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the car has used 3/4 of its gas, so it has 1/4 tank left, and since a full tank is 100 miles, 1/4 tank is 25 miles.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should set up a proportion.\n\nIf 1 tank = 100 miles\n\nThen, 1/4 tank = ? miles\n\nSo, ? = (1/4) * 100 = 25 miles\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the car's fuel consumption rate, which would be 1 tank per 100 miles, or 0.01 tank per mile.\n\nBut that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nI think the simplest way is to recognize that if the car has used 3/4 of its gas, it has 1/4 tank left, and since a full tank allows 100 miles, 1/4 tank allows 25 miles.\n\nTherefore, the car can travel 25 more miles before running out of gas.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, does the car's fuel efficiency change with the amount of gas in the tank? Maybe with very low fuel levels, the fuel efficiency changes due to partial filling affecting the fuel pump or something like that. But since the problem doesn't provide any information about that, I should assume constant fuel efficiency.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The problem states miles and tank fractions, so no need to convert between different units.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps I should consider whether the car can travel exactly 25 miles before running out of gas, or if there might be some reserve in the tank. But again, since the problem doesn't mention any reserve, I should assume that when the tank is empty, the car stops.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that the car can travel 25 more miles before running out of gas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
