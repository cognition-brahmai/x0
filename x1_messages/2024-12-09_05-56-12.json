        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Jane and John, and Jane has twice as many marbles as John. Together, they have 36 marbles. I need to find out how many marbles Jane has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the number of marbles each person has. Let's say John has x marbles. Since Jane has twice as many as John, she would have 2x marbles.\n\nNow, together they have 36 marbles. So, if I add John's marbles and Jane's marbles together, it should equal 36. That gives me the equation:\n\nx + 2x = 36\n\nCombining like terms, that's 3x = 36.\n\nTo find x, I need to divide both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 36 / 3\n\nSo, x = 12\n\nNow, since Jane has twice as many as John, her marbles would be 2 * 12 = 24.\n\nLet me double-check that. If John has 12 marbles and Jane has 24, together that's 12 + 24 = 36, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, Jane has 24 marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
