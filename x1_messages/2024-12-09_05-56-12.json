        "content": "Alright, I've got this differential equation to solve using Laplace transforms: y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^(-t), with initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0. I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Laplace transforms are and how they apply to differential equations. Laplace transforms are a tool that turns differential equations into algebraic equations, which are often easier to solve. The transform takes a function of time, y(t), and maps it to a function of a complex variable, s, which is Y(s).\n\nSo, the first step is to take the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation. I need to know the Laplace transforms of y'', y', y, and e^(-t).\n\nStarting with the left side: y'' + 3y' + 2y.\n\nI remember that the Laplace transform of y'' is s^2 Y(s) - s y(0) - y'(0), assuming y and y' are zero at t=0. Similarly, the transform of y' is s Y(s) - y(0), and the transform of y is Y(s).\n\nGiven that y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0, these simplify quite a bit.\n\nSo, Laplace{y''} = s^2 Y(s) - s*0 - 0 = s^2 Y(s)\n\nLaplace{y'} = s Y(s) - 0 = s Y(s)\n\nLaplace{y} = Y(s)\n\nSo, the left side becomes: s^2 Y(s) + 3s Y(s) + 2 Y(s) = (s^2 + 3s + 2) Y(s)\n\nNow, the right side: e^(-t). I think the Laplace transform of e^(at) is 1/(s - a), so for e^(-t), a = -1, so it's 1/(s - (-1)) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nSo, overall, the transformed equation is:\n\n(s^2 + 3s + 2) Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)\n\nNow, I can solve for Y(s):\n\nY(s) = 1/[(s + 1)(s^2 + 3s + 2)]\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to simplify this expression. First, I can factor the denominator s^2 + 3s + 2.\n\ns^2 + 3s + 2 = (s + 1)(s + 2)\n\nSo, Y(s) = 1/[(s + 1)(s + 1)(s + 2)] = 1/[(s + 1)^2 (s + 2)]\n\nOkay, now I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to get y(t). To do that, it's often helpful to decompose Y(s) into partial fractions.\n\nSo, let's set up the partial fraction decomposition:\n\n1/[(s + 1)^2 (s + 2)] = A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 1)^2 + C/(s + 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator to clear the fractions:\n\n1 = A(s + 1)(s + 2) + B(s + 2) + C(s + 1)^2\n\nNow, I need to solve for A, B, and C. I can do this by choosing values for s that simplify the equation.\n\nLet's choose s = -1:\n\n1 = A(-1 + 1)(-1 + 2) + B(-1 + 2) + C(-1 + 1)^2\n\n1 = A(0)(1) + B(1) + C(0)^2\n\n1 = B\n\nSo, B = 1\n\nNext, choose s = -2:\n\n1 = A(-2 + 1)(-2 + 2) + B(-2 + 2) + C(-2 + 1)^2\n\n1 = A(-1)(0) + B(0) + C(-1)^2\n\n1 = 0 + 0 + C(1)\n\nSo, C = 1\n\nNow, choose another value for s, say s = 0:\n\n1 = A(0 + 1)(0 + 2) + B(0 + 2) + C(0 + 1)^2\n\n1 = A(1)(2) + B(2) + C(1)^2\n\n1 = 2A + 2B + C\n\nWe already know B = 1 and C = 1, so:\n\n1 = 2A + 2(1) + 1\n\n1 = 2A + 2 + 1\n\n1 = 2A + 3\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n-2 = 2A\n\nSo, A = -1\n\nTherefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\nY(s) = -1/(s + 1) + 1/(s + 1)^2 + 1/(s + 2)\n\nNow, I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of each term.\n\nRecall that:\n\n- Laplace^{-1}{1/(s + a)} = e^(-at)\n\n- Laplace^{-1}{1/(s + a)^2} = t e^(-at)\n\n- Laplace^{-1}{1/(s + b)} = e^(-bt)\n\nSo, applying these:\n\ny(t) = -e^(-t) + t e^(-t) + e^(-2t)\n\nThat's the solution to the differential equation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I have y(t) = -e^(-t) + t e^(-t) + e^(-2t). Does this satisfy the original equation and the initial conditions?\n\nFirst, check initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = -e^(0) + 0*e^(0) + e^(0) = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0\n\ny'(t) = d/dt [-e^(-t) + t e^(-t) + e^(-2t)]\n\nLet's compute y'(t):\n\n- d/dt [ -e^(-t) ] = e^(-t)\n\n- d/dt [ t e^(-t) ] = e^(-t) - t e^(-t)\n\n- d/dt [ e^(-2t) ] = -2 e^(-2t)\n\nSo, y'(t) = e^(-t) + e^(-t) - t e^(-t) - 2 e^(-2t) = 2 e^(-t) - t e^(-t) - 2 e^(-2t)\n\nNow, y'(0) = 2 e^(0) - 0 e^(0) - 2 e^(0) = 2 - 0 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, initial conditions are satisfied.\n\nNow, let's plug y(t) back into the original equation to verify:\n\ny'' + 3y' + 2y = e^(-t)\n\nFirst, find y''(t):\n\ny'(t) = 2 e^(-t) - t e^(-t) - 2 e^(-2t)\n\ny''(t) = -2 e^(-t) - [e^(-t) - t e^(-t)] + 4 e^(-2t) = -2 e^(-t) - e^(-t) + t e^(-t) + 4 e^(-2t) = -3 e^(-t) + t e^(-t) + 4 e^(-2t)\n\nNow, compute y'' + 3y' + 2y:\n\ny'' = -3 e^(-t) + t e^(-t) + 4 e^(-2t)\n\n3y' = 3 [2 e^(-t) - t e^(-t) - 2 e^(-2t)] = 6 e^(-t) - 3 t e^(-t) - 6 e^(-2t)\n\n2y = 2 [ -e^(-t) + t e^(-t) + e^(-2t) ] = -2 e^(-t) + 2 t e^(-t) + 2 e^(-2t)\n\nNow, add them up:\n\ny'' + 3y' + 2y = (-3 + 6 - 2) e^(-t) + (1 - 3 + 2) t e^(-t) + (4 - 6 + 2) e^(-2t)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-3 + 6 - 2) = 1 e^(-t)\n\n(1 - 3 + 2) = 0 t e^(-t)\n\n(4 - 6 + 2) = 0 e^(-2t)\n\nSo, y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^(-t) + 0 + 0 = e^(-t)\n\nWhich matches the right side of the original equation.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is y(t) = -e^(-t) + t e^(-t) + e^(-2t)\n\nI think that's it. If I made any mistakes, please let me know.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{y(t) = -e^{-t} + t e^{-t} + e^{-2t}} \\]"
