        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 6 red balls and 4 green balls, making a total of 10 balls. The question is, if you pick two balls at once without looking, what's the probability that both will be red?\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall how to calculate probabilities, especially when it comes to selecting multiple items at once.\n\nI know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is picking two red balls, and the total outcomes would be picking any two balls from the bag.\n\nLet me think about how to find the total number of ways to pick two balls from ten. I think this is a combination problem because the order in which I pick the balls doesn't matter. It's about selecting a pair, not about the sequence.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for the total number of ways to pick two balls from ten, it would be C(10, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 possible pairs of balls that can be picked from the bag.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to pick two red balls. There are 6 red balls, so I need to find C(6, 2).\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6 - 2)!) = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4!)) = (6 \u00d7 5) / 2 = 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 possible pairs of red balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red should be the number of red pairs divided by the total number of pairs, which is 15/45. That simplifies to 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the probability of picking a red ball first and then another red ball second, since we're picking without replacement.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is 6/10, since there are 6 red balls out of 10.\n\nThen, after picking one red ball, there are now 5 red balls left and a total of 9 balls left in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 5/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening is (6/10) \u00d7 (5/9) = (3/5) \u00d7 (5/9) = (3 \u00d7 5) / (5 \u00d7 9) = 15 / 45 = 1/3.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the probability is indeed 1/3.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I think about picking two balls at once as picking one ball and then another without regard to order, and without replacement.\n\nSo, the first ball has a 6/10 chance of being red, and the second has a 5/9 chance of being red, given the first was red.\n\nMultiplying those gives me again 30/90, which is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the green balls. The probability that both balls are green.\n\nThere are 4 green balls, so C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nTotal pairs are 45, so probability of both being green is 6/45 = 2/15.\n\nBut the question is about both being red, which we've already calculated as 15/45 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check the probability of one red and one green.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red and one green would be C(6,1) \u00d7 C(4,1) = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.\n\nSo, probability is 24/45 = 8/15.\n\nNow, let's see if all the probabilities add up to 1.\n\nProbability both red: 15/45\n\nBoth green: 6/45\n\nOne red and one green: 24/45\n\nTotal: 15 + 6 + 24 = 45/45 = 1.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, confidently, the probability that both balls are red is 15/45, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
