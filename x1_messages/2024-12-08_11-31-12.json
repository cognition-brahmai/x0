        "content": "So, there are five friends at a restaurant, each ordered a different dish, but the waiter brought them out in a random order. We want to know the probability that exactly two of them get their correct dish. Hmm, interesting problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are five dishes and five friends, each has one correct dish that they ordered. The dishes are mixed up, so each friend gets a random dish. We need to find the probability that exactly two friends receive the correct dish.\n\nAlright, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible ways the dishes can be distributed is the number of permutations of five dishes, which is 5 factorial, or 5!.\n\n5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to distribute the dishes.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways exactly two friends get their correct dish.\n\nWait a minute, if exactly two friends get their correct dish, that means the other three do not get their correct dish. So, we need to count the number of permutations where exactly two items are in their correct positions, and the other three are not.\n\nThis sounds like a derangement problem. A derangement is a permutation where no element appears in its original position. So, for the three friends who didn't get their correct dish, their dishes must be deranged.\n\nLet me recall, the number of derangements of n objects is denoted by !n, and it's calculated as:\n\n!n = n! \u00d7 (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n/n!)\n\nFor n = 3, let's calculate !3.\n\n!3 = 3! \u00d7 (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3!)\n\n= 6 \u00d7 (1 - 1 + 1/2 - 1/6)\n\n= 6 \u00d7 (0 + 0.5 - 0.1667)\n\n= 6 \u00d7 0.3333\n\n= approximately 2.\n\nWait, but I know that !3 is exactly 2. Let me confirm:\n\n!3 = 3! \u00d7 (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3!)\n\n= 6 \u00d7 (1 - 1 + 1/2 - 1/6)\n\n= 6 \u00d7 (0 + 0.5 - 0.1667)\n\n= 6 \u00d7 (0.3333) = 2.\n\nYes, !3 = 2.\n\nSo, for the three friends who didn't get their correct dish, there are 2 ways their dishes can be deranged.\n\nNow, we need to choose which two out of the five friends get their correct dish. That can be done in C(5,2) ways, where C(n,k) is the combination formula.\n\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2! \u00d7 (5-2)!) = (120) / (2 \u00d7 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose which two friends get their correct dish.\n\nFor each of these 10 ways, the remaining three friends have their dishes deranged in 2 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 \u00d7 2 = 20.\n\nNow, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 20 / 120 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning. It seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nLet me consider a smaller case to verify. Suppose there are three friends and three dishes.\n\nTotal permutations: 3! = 6.\n\nNumber of ways exactly two get their correct dish: Well, if two get their correct dish, the third must also get their correct dish, because there are no other options. So, it's impossible to have exactly two correct dishes in this case. The only possibility for exactly two correct is if all three are correct, but that's only one way.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier logic:\n\nC(3,2) \u00d7 !1 = 3 \u00d7 0 = 0.\n\nBecause !1 = 0, since there's only one item, and it can't be deranged.\n\nBut in reality, having exactly two correct in three friends is impossible because if two have the correct dish, the third must also have the correct dish.\n\nSo, my earlier calculation seems consistent, as C(3,2) \u00d7 !1 = 3 \u00d7 0 = 0, which matches the reality that it's impossible.\n\nAnother check: for four friends.\n\nTotal permutations: 4! = 24.\n\nNumber of ways exactly two get their correct dish: C(4,2) \u00d7 !2 = 6 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nIs this correct?\n\nLet me enumerate:\n\nSuppose friends A, B, C, D ordered dishes A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nWe choose two to have correct dishes, say A and B.\n\nThen C and D must have each other's wrong dishes, so C gets D's dish, and D gets C's dish.\n\nSimilarly, if A and C have correct dishes, then B and D must have each other's wrong dishes: B gets D's dish, D gets B's dish.\n\nSimilarly for A and D, B and C, B and D, A and C.\n\nSo, total of 6 ways, which matches C(4,2) \u00d7 !2 = 6 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nSo, my formula seems to hold for n=4.\n\nBack to n=5.\n\nC(5,2) \u00d7 !3 = 10 \u00d7 2 = 20 favorable outcomes.\n\nTotal outcomes: 5! = 120.\n\nProbability: 20 / 120 = 1/6.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe number of ways exactly k friends get their correct dish is:\n\nC(n,k) \u00d7 !\uff08n-k\uff09\n\nWhich is exactly what I used.\n\nSo, it should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider the total probability and subtract the probabilities of other cases.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the probability that exactly two specific friends get their correct dish, and then multiply by the number of ways to choose those two friends.\n\nSo, fix two friends who get their correct dish, say friend A and friend B.\n\nThen, the other three friends (C, D, E) must not get their correct dish.\n\nSo, the number of ways for C, D, E to have deranged dishes is !3 = 2.\n\nSo, for each pair of friends who get their correct dish, there are 2 ways for the others to have deranged dishes.\n\nAnd there are C(5,2) = 10 ways to choose the pair.\n\nThus, total favorable outcomes: 10 \u00d7 2 = 20.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 120.\n\nProbability: 20/120 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we have five friends: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nWe want exactly two of them to have their correct dish.\n\nLet's choose which two get their correct dish. There are C(5,2) = 10 ways to choose this pair.\n\nSay we choose A and B to have their correct dish.\n\nThen, C, D, E must have deranged dishes, meaning no one gets their correct dish.\n\nNumber of derangements for three items is !3 = 2.\n\nSo, for each choice of the pair that gets their correct dish, there are 2 ways for the others to have deranged dishes.\n\nHence, total favorable outcomes: 10 \u00d7 2 = 20.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 120.\n\nProbability: 20/120 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider the probability that two specific friends get their correct dish, and the other three do not.\n\nThe probability that A and B get their correct dish, and C, D, E do not.\n\nThe probability that A gets their correct dish is 1/5.\n\nGiven that A gets their correct dish, the probability that B gets their correct dish is 1/4.\n\nGiven that A and B have their correct dish, the probability that C does not get their correct dish is 2/3.\n\nGiven that A, B have their correct dish and C does not, the probability that D does not get their correct dish is 1/2.\n\nAnd finally, given all that, the probability that E does not get their correct dish is 1.\n\nSo, the probability for a specific pair, say A and B, to have their correct dish and others not is:\n\n(1/5) \u00d7 (1/4) \u00d7 (2/3) \u00d7 (1/2) \u00d7 1 = (1/5 \u00d7 1/4 \u00d7 2/3 \u00d7 1/2) = (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)/(5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2) = 2/(120) = 1/60.\n\nWait, but there are C(5,2) = 10 such pairs.\n\nSo, total probability is 10 \u00d7 1/60 = 10/60 = 1/6.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, this reinforces that the probability is indeed 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of permutations with exactly k fixed points.\n\nA fixed point in a permutation is an element that remains in its original position.\n\nHere, a fixed point would be a friend getting their correct dish.\n\nThe number of permutations of n elements with exactly k fixed points is:\n\nC(n,k) \u00d7 !\uff08n-k\uff09\n\nWhich is exactly what we used.\n\nSo, for n=5 and k=2, it's C(5,2) \u00d7 !3 = 10 \u00d7 2 = 20.\n\nTotal permutations: 120.\n\nProbability: 20/120 = 1/6.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the number of permutations with exactly k fixed points.\n\nBut that seems more complicated for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the general formula for the probability that exactly k elements are in their correct positions in a random permutation of n elements.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nP(k) = 1/(k!) \u00d7 \u2211_{i=0}^{n-k} (-1)^i / i!\n\nAs i goes from 0 to n-k.\n\nBut for our purposes, the earlier method seems sufficient.\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that the probability is 1/6.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any overlaps or miscalculations.\n\nSuppose we have five friends: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nWe choose two to have their correct dish, say A and B.\n\nThen, C, D, E must have deranged dishes.\n\nThe derangements of C, D, E are:\n\n- C gets D's dish, D gets E's dish, E gets C's dish.\n\n- C gets E's dish, D gets C's dish, E gets D's dish.\n\nSo, two derangements.\n\nSimilarly, for any other pair chosen to have their correct dish, the remaining three will have two derangements.\n\nAnd since there are C(5,2) = 10 ways to choose the pair, total favorable outcomes are 10 \u00d7 2 = 20.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 120.\n\nProbability: 20/120 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider that the probability of exactly k successes in a permutation is given by the renormalized factorial moments of the Poisson distribution with \u03bb=1.\n\nBut that's more advanced and not necessary for this problem.\n\nGiven all this, I think it's safe to conclude that the probability is 1/6.\n\nSo, the answer is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
