        "content": "So the factory is making two products, A and B. It produces 250 units of A every hour and 400 units of B each hour. The goal is to make 10,000 units of each product. I need to find out how many hours it will take to reach that.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many hours it takes to produce 10,000 units of product A separately and then do the same for product B. After that, I can see which one takes more time because the factory is producing both products simultaneously, but I need to meet the demand for each.\n\nLet me start with product A. If the factory makes 250 units of A per hour, to find out how many hours it takes to make 10,000 units, I can divide the total required units by the hourly production rate.\n\nSo, for product A:\n\nHours for A = Total units of A / Production rate of A per hour\n\nHours for A = 10,000 / 250\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n250 times 40 is 10,000. So, hours for A is 40 hours.\n\nNow, for product B.\n\nProduction rate is 400 units per hour.\n\nTotal required is 10,000 units.\n\nHours for B = 10,000 / 400\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n400 times 25 is 10,000. So, hours for B is 25 hours.\n\nNow, since the factory is producing both products simultaneously, I need to consider the time it takes to meet the demand for both.\n\nProduct A requires 40 hours, and product B requires 25 hours. Since the factory is making both at the same time, the total time needed will be the time it takes to produce the product that requires the most hours. In this case, it's product A, which needs 40 hours.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the factory is producing both products at the same time, maybe there's a way to optimize the production so that both products reach their required amounts in less time.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the combined production rates.\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf the factory produces 250 units of A and 400 units of B each hour, then in one hour, it produces a total of 250 + 400 = 650 units.\n\nBut, the goal is to have 10,000 units of each, which means 10,000 of A and 10,000 of B, totaling 20,000 units.\n\nIf I divide the total required units by the combined hourly production, that would be 20,000 / 650, which is approximately 30.77 hours.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if that's correct because the factory is producing both products simultaneously, but the required amounts are separate for each product.\n\nI think the initial approach is correct. Since the factory is producing both products at the same time, but the limiting factor is the product that takes the longest to produce the required amount.\n\nIn this case, product A takes 40 hours, and product B takes 25 hours. So, after 40 hours, product A will have reached 10,000 units, and product B will have produced 40 hours * 400 units/hour = 16,000 units, which is more than the required 10,000.\n\nTherefore, the factory will have produced enough of both products after 40 hours.\n\nWait, but that seems off because product B is being overproduced. Maybe there's a better way to schedule the production to meet both targets simultaneously without overproducing one product.\n\nLet me try to set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of hours the factory runs as h.\n\nIn h hours, it will produce 250h units of A and 400h units of B.\n\nWe need at least 10,000 units of each.\n\nSo, we have two inequalities:\n\n250h >= 10,000\n\n400h >= 10,000\n\nI need to solve for h in both inequalities and take the largest h to satisfy both.\n\nFirst inequality:\n\n250h >= 10,000\n\nh >= 10,000 / 250\n\nh >= 40\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n400h >= 10,000\n\nh >= 10,000 / 400\n\nh >= 25\n\nSo, h needs to be at least 40 hours to satisfy the first inequality and at least 25 hours for the second.\n\nSince both need to be satisfied, we take the larger value, which is 40 hours.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs to run for 40 hours to produce at least 10,000 units of each product.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory could adjust the production rates for A and B, perhaps it could produce both in less time, but based on the given production rates, it's fixed at 250 and 400 per hour, respectively.\n\nSo, the answer is 40 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
