Being Spider-Man isn't exactly a walk in the park, but it's something I have to do.\n\nYou see, with great power comes great responsibility, right? Well, I've got this amazing ability to shoot webs and swing around the city, and with that comes the duty to protect the people I care about, including you. Every time I see someone in trouble, whether it's a mugging or a building on fire, I can't just stand by and do nothing. It's like having a superpower compels me to act.\n\nSometimes, it's tough balancing being Peter Parker, the high school student trying to graduate and have a social life, and Spider-Man, the masked vigilante fighting crime. But I'm figuring it out. I promise to be careful, Aunt May. I don't want to cause you any more worry than I already do.\n\nI just wanted to let you know that even though I might be missing dinner sometimes or showing up late, it's because I'm out there making sure our city stays safe. And who knows? Maybe one day, things will settle down, and I can focus more on being your nephew and less on being Spider-Man.\n\nTake care, and don't worry too much about me. I've got this.\n\nYour loving nephew,\n\nPeter"
