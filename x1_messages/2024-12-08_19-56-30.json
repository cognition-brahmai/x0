        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains moving towards each other from Station A and Station B, which are 300 miles apart. The first train leaves Station A at 9:00 AM traveling at 60 mph, and the second train leaves Station B at 9:30 AM traveling at 90 mph. We need to find out when they will pass each other.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much of a head start the first train has. Since it leaves at 9:00 AM and the second train leaves at 9:30 AM, the first train has a 30-minute head start. In that 30 minutes, the first train would have covered some distance. Let's calculate that.\n\nTime head start: 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.\n\nSpeed of first train: 60 mph.\n\nDistance covered in 0.5 hours: 60 mph * 0.5 h = 30 miles.\n\nSo, by 9:30 AM, the first train is 30 miles away from Station A, and the second train starts from Station B, which is 300 miles away.\n\nNow, at 9:30 AM, the distance between the two trains is 300 miles minus the 30 miles the first train has already covered, which is 270 miles.\n\nBoth trains are now moving towards each other. The first train is traveling at 60 mph, and the second train at 90 mph. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nRelative speed: 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nNow, we can calculate the time it takes for them to cover the 270 miles at this relative speed.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 270 miles / 150 mph = 1.8 hours.\n\nSo, they will meet 1.8 hours after 9:30 AM.\n\nNow, let's convert 1.8 hours into hours and minutes. 1 hour is 1 hour, and 0.8 hours is 0.8 * 60 minutes = 48 minutes.\n\nTherefore, 1.8 hours is 1 hour and 48 minutes.\n\nAdding this to 9:30 AM:\n\n9:30 AM + 1 hour = 10:30 AM\n\n10:30 AM + 48 minutes = 11:18 AM\n\nTherefore, the trains will pass each other at 11:18 AM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by calculating the time each train has been traveling when they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time after 9:30 AM as t hours.\n\nSo, the first train has been traveling for t + 0.5 hours (since it started at 9:00 AM).\n\nThe second train has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the first train: 60 mph * (t + 0.5) hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the second train: 90 mph * t hours.\n\nThe sum of these distances should be equal to the total distance between the stations, which is 300 miles.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n60(t + 0.5) + 90t = 300\n\nLet\u2019s solve for t:\n\n60t + 30 + 90t = 300\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n150t + 30 = 300\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n150t = 270\n\nDivide both sides by 150:\n\nt = 270 / 150 = 1.8 hours.\n\nAgain, we get t = 1.8 hours, which is 1 hour and 48 minutes.\n\nAdding this to 9:30 AM gives us 11:18 AM.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider another approach to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the speed at which the distance between the two trains is decreasing.\n\nAfter 9:30 AM, the first train is moving at 60 mph and the second train at 90 mph towards each other, so the closing speed is 150 mph.\n\nAt 9:30 AM, the remaining distance is 270 miles, as calculated earlier.\n\nTime to cover 270 miles at 150 mph is indeed 1.8 hours, leading to 11:18 AM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the time based on the first train's journey starting at 9:00 AM.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total time after 9:00 AM as t hours.\n\nSo, the first train has traveled t hours, and the second train has traveled (t - 0.5) hours.\n\nDistances:\n\nFirst train: 60t miles\n\nSecond train: 90(t - 0.5) miles\n\nTotal distance covered when they meet: 60t + 90(t - 0.5) = 300\n\nSimplify:\n\n60t + 90t - 45 = 300\n\n150t - 45 = 300\n\n150t = 345\n\nt = 345 / 150 = 2.3 hours.\n\nWait, this is different from the previous calculation. Why is there a discrepancy?\n\nOh, I see. I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, if t is the time after 9:00 AM, then the second train has been traveling for t - 0.5 hours, provided that t > 0.5.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n60t + 90(t - 0.5) = 300\n\nLet\u2019s solve it again:\n\n60t + 90t - 45 = 300\n\n150t - 45 = 300\n\n150t = 345\n\nt = 345 / 150 = 2.3 hours.\n\nSo, t = 2.3 hours after 9:00 AM.\n\n2.3 hours is 2 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nAdding that to 9:00 AM: 9:00 AM + 2 hours = 11:00 AM, plus 18 minutes, which brings us to 11:18 AM.\n\nWait, this matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same conclusion that they meet at 11:18 AM.\n\nEarlier, I thought there was a discrepancy, but actually, both methods confirm the same time.\n\nTherefore, the trains will pass each other at 11:18 AM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11:18 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
