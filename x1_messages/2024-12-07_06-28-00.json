        "content": "The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm, we can plug these values into the formula to find the volume.\n\nFirst, square the radius: 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm = 25 cm\u00b2.\n\nThen, multiply this result by the height: 25 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 10 cm = 250 cm\u00b3.\n\nFinally, multiply by \u03c0 (approximately 3.1416): 250 cm\u00b3 \u00d7 3.1416 \u2248 785.4 cm\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cylindrical container is approximately 785.4 cubic centimeters."
