Smart pointers are a crucial part of modern C++ programming, as they help manage memory automatically, preventing leaks and making code safer and cleaner. In this application, we'll create a simple example that demonstrates the use of different types of smart pointers: `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and `weak_ptr`.\n\nFirst, let's understand what smart pointers are and why they are important.\n\n## What are Smart Pointers?\n\nSmart pointers are classes that act like pointers but manage the lifetime of the objects they point to. They automatically handle memory deallocation when the object is no longer needed, which helps prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers.\n\nC++ provides several types of smart pointers in the `<memory>` header:\n\n1. **`unique_ptr`**: Manages exclusive ownership of an object. Only one `unique_ptr` can own the object at a time.\n\n2. **`shared_ptr`**: Manages shared ownership of an object. Multiple `shared_ptr`s can own the same object, and the object is deleted only when all owners are destroyed or reset.\n\n3. **`weak_ptr`**: Acts as an observer to a `shared_ptr`-managed object without affecting its lifetime. It's used to break cycles in `shared_ptr` ownership.\n\n## Example Application\n\nWe'll create a simple application that demonstrates the use of these smart pointers with a custom class called `Resource`. This class will simulate a resource that requires proper management to prevent leaks.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Resource Class\n\nFirst, let's define the `Resource` class. This class will have a constructor and a destructor to track when objects are created and destroyed.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nclass Resource {\npublic:\n    Resource() {\n        std::cout << \"Resource created\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    ~Resource() {\n        std::cout << \"Resource destroyed\" << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Step 2: Using unique_ptr\n\n`unique_ptr` is used for exclusive ownership. Only one `unique_ptr` can own the resource at a time.\n\n```cpp\n#include <memory>\n\nint main() {\n    {\n        std::cout << \"unique_ptr example:\" << std::endl;\n        std::unique_ptr<Resource> res(new Resource());\n        // res now owns the Resource object\n    }\n    // res goes out of scope here, and the Resource is automatically destroyed\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Using shared_ptr\n\n`shared_ptr` allows multiple owners of the same resource. The resource is destroyed only when all `shared_ptr`s pointing to it are destroyed or reset.\n\n```cpp\n#include <memory>\n\nint main() {\n    {\n        std::cout << \"shared_ptr example:\" << std::endl;\n        std::shared_ptr<Resource> res1 = std::make_shared<Resource>();\n        {\n            std::shared_ptr<Resource> res2 = res1;\n            // Both res1 and res2 own the same Resource object\n        }\n        // res2 is destroyed here, but the Resource still exists because res1 owns it\n    }\n    // res1 is destroyed here, and the Resource is automatically destroyed\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Using weak_ptr\n\n`weak_ptr` is used to observe a `shared_ptr`-managed resource without extending its lifetime. It helps avoid reference cycles.\n\n```cpp\n#include <memory>\n\nint main() {\n    {\n        std::cout << \"weak_ptr example:\" << std::endl;\n        std::shared_ptr<Resource> res = std::make_shared<Resource>();\n        std::weak_ptr<Resource> weakRes = res;\n        \n        // Use weakRes to check if the Resource still exists\n        if (auto sharedRes = weakRes.lock()) {\n            std::cout << \"Resource still exists.\" << std::endl;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Resource has been destroyed.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n        \n        // Destroy the shared_ptr\n        res.reset();\n        \n        // Check again\n        if (auto sharedRes = weakRes.lock()) {\n            std::cout << \"Resource still exists.\" << std::endl;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Resource has been destroyed.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Full Application Code\n\nCombining all the examples above, here's the full application code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <memory>\n\nclass Resource {\npublic:\n    Resource() {\n        std::cout << \"Resource created\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    ~Resource() {\n        std::cout << \"Resource destroyed\" << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    {\n        std::cout << \"unique_ptr example:\" << std::endl;\n        std::unique_ptr<Resource> res(new Resource());\n        // res now owns the Resource object\n    }\n    // res goes out of scope here, and the Resource is automatically destroyed\n    \n    {\n        std::cout << \"\\nshared_ptr example:\" << std::endl;\n        std::shared_ptr<Resource> res1 = std::make_shared<Resource>();\n        {\n            std::shared_ptr<Resource> res2 = res1;\n            // Both res1 and res2 own the same Resource object\n        }\n        // res2 is destroyed here, but the Resource still exists because res1 owns it\n    }\n    // res1 is destroyed here, and the Resource is automatically destroyed\n    \n    {\n        std::cout << \"\\nweak_ptr example:\" << std::endl;\n        std::shared_ptr<Resource> res = std::make_shared<Resource>();\n        std::weak_ptr<Resource> weakRes = res;\n        \n        // Use weakRes to check if the Resource still exists\n        if (auto sharedRes = weakRes.lock()) {\n            std::cout << \"Resource still exists.\" << std::endl;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Resource has been destroyed.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n        \n        // Destroy the shared_ptr\n        res.reset();\n        \n        // Check again\n        if (auto sharedRes = weakRes.lock()) {\n            std::cout << \"Resource still exists.\" << std::endl;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Resource has been destroyed.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **unique_ptr Example**:\n   - A `unique_ptr` is created to manage a `Resource` object.\n   - When the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope, the `Resource` is automatically destroyed.\n\n2. **shared_ptr Example**:\n   - Two `shared_ptr`s manage the same `Resource` object.\n   - The `Resource` is destroyed only after both `shared_ptr`s are destroyed or reset.\n\n3. **weak_ptr Example**:\n   - A `weak_ptr` observes a `shared_ptr`-managed `Resource`.\n   - After the `shared_ptr` is reset, the `weak_ptr` no longer refers to a valid object.\n\nThis application demonstrates how smart pointers can be used to manage the lifetime of objects in C++, making memory management safer and more efficient."
