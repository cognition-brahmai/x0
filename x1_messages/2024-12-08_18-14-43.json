Each step in your plan should correspond with an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\n\nBing[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information via Bing's search engine. This tool is useful for finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's query. The function doesn't directly provide answers; it finds a list of websites that might contain the necessary information.\nWebReader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links. The input should consist of one or more links and produces plain text output containing the content of these links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nSAM[input]: Question answering language model, particularly effective in providing answers based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :data[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :data1:?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a data variable, e.g., SAM[What is the capital of France, given :data2:?]\n\nEnsure only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :data0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:data[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the architect behind the design of the Sydney Opera House and what were some of his other notable works?"
