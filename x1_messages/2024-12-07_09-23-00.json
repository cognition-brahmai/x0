        "content": "To design a SQL query that retrieves the top 10 most frequently occurring words in the \"comments\" table, along with their frequency count, we need to consider the structure of the table and how to break down the comment text into individual words.\n\nGiven the table structure:\n\n- id (unique identifier for each comment)\n\n- user_id (identifier for the user who posted the comment)\n\n- comment_text (the text content of the comment)\n\n- timestamp (the date and time when the comment was posted)\n\nWe need to:\n\n1. Extract individual words from the \"comment_text\" column.\n\n2. Count the frequency of each word.\n\n3. Retrieve the top 10 words based on their frequency.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Split the \"comment_text\" into individual words. This can be done using string functions available in SQL, such as `SPLIT_PART` or regular expressions, depending on the SQL dialect being used.\n\n2. **Normalization**: Ensure that words are compared in a case-insensitive manner and remove any punctuation. This might involve converting all words to lowercase and stripping non-alphabetic characters.\n\n3. **Aggregation**: Count the occurrences of each word.\n\n4. **Sorting and Limiting**: Sort the words based on their frequency in descending order and limit the result to the top 10.\n\n### Solution Query\n\nAssuming we are using PostgreSQL, which has robust string and regular expression capabilities, the query can be constructed as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    word, \n    COUNT(*) AS frequency\nFROM (\n    SELECT \n        REGEXP_MATCHES(\n            LOWER(comment_text), \n            '\\y[a-zA-Z]+(?:\\'[a-zA-Z]+)?\\y', \n            'g'\n        ) AS words\n    FROM \n        comments\n) subquery\nCROSS JOIN UNNEST(words) AS word\nGROUP BY \n    word\nORDER BY \n    frequency DESC, \n    word\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Subquery**:\n    - `LOWER(comment_text)`: Converts the comment text to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.\n    - `REGEXP_MATCHES(comment_text, '\\y[a-zA-Z]+(?:\\'[a-zA-Z]+)?\\y', 'g')`: Uses a regular expression to match words consisting of alphabetic characters, including those with apostrophes (e.g., \"don't\"). The `\\y` word boundaries ensure that we are matching whole words.\n    - This returns an array of words for each comment.\n\n2. **CROSS JOIN UNNEST(words) AS word**:\n    - This expands the array of words into individual rows.\n\n3. **GROUP BY word**:\n    - Groups the rows by each unique word.\n\n4. **COUNT(*) AS frequency**:\n    - Counts the occurrences of each word.\n\n5. **ORDER BY frequency DESC, word**:\n    - Sorts the words first by frequency in descending order and then alphabetically by word.\n\n6. **LIMIT 10**:\n    - Limits the result to the top 10 words based on frequency.\n\nThis query provides a way to analyze the most common words in the comments, which can be useful for understanding trends, popular topics, or common issues mentioned in the comments section."
