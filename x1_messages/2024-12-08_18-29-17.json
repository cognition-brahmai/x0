        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle, and it's given that its length is twice its width. Also, the perimeter of this rectangle is 36 units. We need to find its dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) is the sum of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula is:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times \\text{length} + 2 \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nor more compactly,\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the length is twice the width. So, we can express the length in terms of the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 36, we can substitute the expressions into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ 36 = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nBut since \\( l = 2w \\), we can substitute \\( 2w \\) for \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 36 = 2(2w + w) \\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 36 = 2(3w) \\]\n\n\\[ 36 = 6w \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{36}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ w = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the width is 6 units.\n\nNow, since the length is twice the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are:\n\n- Length: 12 units\n- Width: 6 units\n\nTo double-check, let's plug these values back into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) = 2(12 + 6) = 2 \\times 18 = 36 \\]\n\nYes, it matches the given perimeter. So, our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Length: } 12, \\text{ Width: } 6} \\]"
