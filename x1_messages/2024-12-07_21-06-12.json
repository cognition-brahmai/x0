        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 50 people in a group, and among them, 20 like apples, 25 like oranges, and 10 like both apples and oranges. I need to find out how many people don't like either fruit. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here because it deals with overlapping sets. So, if I have the number of people who like apples and the number who like oranges, and I know how many like both, I can find out how many people like either apples or oranges.\n\nThe formula for the number of people who like either apples or oranges is:\n\nNumber liking apples + number liking oranges - number liking both.\n\nSo, that would be 20 + 25 - 10 = 35 people like either apples or oranges.\n\nNow, since there are 50 people in total, the number who don't like either fruit would be the total number minus those who like either apples or oranges.\n\nSo, 50 - 35 = 15 people don't like either fruit.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 20 like apples and 25 like oranges, but 10 like both, then the number who like only apples is 20 - 10 = 10, and the number who like only oranges is 25 - 10 = 15. Then, adding those who like only apples, only oranges, and both, we get 10 + 15 + 10 = 35 people who like at least one of the fruits.\n\nThen, 50 - 35 = 15 people who don't like either. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a Venn diagram to visualize this. Let's draw one.\n\n[Imagining a Venn diagram with two circles overlapping. One circle for apples, one for oranges.]\n\nThe overlap between the two circles represents people who like both apples and oranges, which is 10 people.\n\nThe part of the apples circle outside the overlap is people who like only apples, which is 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the oranges circle outside the overlap is people who like only oranges, which is 25 - 10 = 15.\n\nThen, the area outside both circles represents people who don't like either fruit.\n\nAgain, total people in the apples or oranges circles is 10 + 15 + 10 = 35, and 50 - 35 = 15.\n\nSo, my answer seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there a possibility that some people like other fruits not mentioned here? The question talks about apples and oranges only, so I think it's safe to assume that the only fruits being considered are apples and oranges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some people like both apples and oranges, but perhaps there's some overlap with another fruit, but since no other fruits are mentioned, I don't think that's the case.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether liking apples and liking oranges are mutually exclusive, but the problem states that 10 people like both, so they are not mutually exclusive.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"how many people don't like either fruit?\", which clearly means people who don't like apples or oranges.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial approach, I think 15 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me see if there's a formulaic way to confirm this.\n\nTotal number of people = number who like apples + number who like oranges - number who like both + number who like neither.\n\nSo, 50 = 20 + 25 - 10 + neither.\n\nThat simplifies to 50 = 35 + neither.\n\nTherefore, neither = 50 - 35 = 15.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
