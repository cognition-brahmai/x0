        "content": "Let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. So, we've got a solution that's currently 5% salt by mass, and it weighs 300 grams. We need to figure out how much pure salt to add to make the concentration jump up to 10%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a solution to be 5% salt by mass. That means that in every 100 grams of the solution, there are 5 grams of salt. So, in 300 grams of solution, the amount of salt present would be:\n\nSalt initially = 5% of 300 grams = (5/100) * 300 = 15 grams\n\nThat makes sense. So, there are 15 grams of salt in the original 300 grams of solution.\n\nNow, we're going to add some pure salt to this solution to increase the concentration to 10%. Let's call the amount of pure salt we need to add \"x\" grams.\n\nAfter adding x grams of pure salt, the total mass of the solution becomes 300 grams + x grams.\n\nThe total amount of salt in the new solution is the original 15 grams plus the added x grams, so it's 15 + x grams.\n\nWe want this new solution to be 10% salt by mass. That means that the mass of salt divided by the total mass of the solution should equal 10%, or 0.10.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(15 + x) / (300 + x) = 0.10\n\nNow, we need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by (300 + x) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n15 + x = 0.10 * (300 + x)\n\nNow, distribute the 0.10 on the right side:\n\n15 + x = 30 + 0.10x\n\nNext, let's get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Subtract 0.10x from both sides:\n\n15 + x - 0.10x = 30\n\nSimplify:\n\n15 + 0.90x = 30\n\nNow, subtract 15 from both sides:\n\n0.90x = 15\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.90 to solve for x:\n\nx = 15 / 0.90\n\nx = 16.67 grams\n\nSo, we need to add approximately 16.67 grams of pure salt to the solution to increase the concentration to 10%.\n\nBut let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 300 grams of 5% salt solution, which has 15 grams of salt.\n\nAdd x grams of pure salt, so total salt is 15 + x grams, and total solution is 300 + x grams.\n\nWe want (15 + x)/(300 + x) = 0.10.\n\nSolving that equation gave me x = 16.67 grams.\n\nLet me plug that back in to verify.\n\n(15 + 16.67)/(300 + 16.67) = 31.67/316.67 \u2248 0.10, which is 10%.\n\nLooks good. So, the answer should be approximately 16.67 grams of pure salt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16.67 \\text{ grams}} \\]"
