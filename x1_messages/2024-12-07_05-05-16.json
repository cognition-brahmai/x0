        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If a car burns 1 gallon of gas for every 20 miles it drives, how much gas will it burn driving 240 miles? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The car burns 1 gallon of gas for every 20 miles. So, for every 20 miles, it uses up 1 gallon. I need to find out how many gallons it will use for 240 miles.\n\nFirst, I think I can set up a proportion here. If 20 miles corresponds to 1 gallon, then 240 miles corresponds to x gallons. So, it's like 20 miles : 1 gallon = 240 miles : x gallons.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of division. Since the car goes 20 miles on 1 gallon, to find out how many gallons it needs for 240 miles, I can divide 240 miles by 20 miles per gallon. That should give me the number of gallons needed.\n\nLet me try that. So, 240 miles divided by 20 miles per gallon. Okay, 240 divided by 20 is 12. So, it would be 12 gallons.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the car burns 1 gallon for every 20 miles, then for 20 miles it burns 1 gallon, for 40 miles it burns 2 gallons, and so on. So, for 240 miles, which is 12 times 20 miles, it should burn 12 gallons.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the car's fuel efficiency is 20 miles per gallon. So, to find out how many gallons it needs for 240 miles, I can use the formula:\n\nGallons needed = Total miles / Miles per gallon\n\nSo, gallons needed = 240 miles / 20 miles per gallon = 12 gallons.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the proportion method, I can set it up like this:\n\n20 miles / 1 gallon = 240 miles / x gallons\n\nThen, cross-multiplying, 20x = 240\n\nSo, x = 240 / 20 = 12 gallons\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Is there another way to look at it? Maybe using unit rates or something like that.\n\nWell, the car's fuel consumption rate is 1 gallon per 20 miles. So, the rate is 1 gallon / 20 miles.\n\nTo find out how many gallons are needed for 240 miles, I can multiply the rate by the total miles:\n\nGallons needed = (1 gallon / 20 miles) * 240 miles\n\nThe miles unit cancels out, leaving gallons:\n\n= (1/20) * 240 gallons\n\n= 240/20 gallons\n\n= 12 gallons\n\nSame answer again. It seems no matter which way I approach it, I end up with 12 gallons.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the gas consumption, like maybe the car's efficiency changing at higher miles or something. But based on the information given, there's no indication of any change in efficiency. So, I can assume that the car maintains a constant fuel consumption rate.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The miles cancel out in the calculation, leaving gallons, which is what we're seeking.\n\nAdditionally, I can perform a quick reality check. If a car gets 20 miles per gallon, and you drive 240 miles, it makes sense that you'd need 12 gallons. For example, if it were 20 miles per gallon for 20 miles, it's 1 gallon, so for 240 miles, it's 12 gallons. That seems logical.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is definitely 12 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
