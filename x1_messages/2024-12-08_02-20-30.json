        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of items: Type A and Type B. Type A costs $12 each, and Type B costs $8 each. The customer buys a total of 10 items and spends exactly $100. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A items.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B items.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items is 10.\n\n2. The total cost is $100.\n\nWe can translate these into equations.\n\nFrom the first piece of information:\n\n\\( x + y = 10 \\)\n\nFrom the second piece of information:\n\n\\( 12x + 8y = 100 \\)\n\nSo, now we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 10 \\)\n\n2. \\( 12x + 8y = 100 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for one variable, say \\( y \\):\n\n\\( y = 10 - x \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( y \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 12x + 8(10 - x) = 100 \\)\n\nOkay, let's simplify this:\n\n\\( 12x + 80 - 8x = 100 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 4x + 80 = 100 \\)\n\nSubtract 80 from both sides:\n\n\\( 4x = 20 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\( x = 5 \\)\n\nSo, the number of Type A items is 5.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( y = 10 - 5 = 5 \\)\n\nWait, so both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are 5. Does that make sense?\n\nLet's check the total cost:\n\n\\( 12 \\times 5 + 8 \\times 5 = 60 + 40 = 100 \\)\n\nYes, that matches the total cost. And the total number of items is \\( 5 + 5 = 10 \\), which also matches.\n\nBut let's see if there are other possible solutions. Maybe there's another combination that works.\n\nSuppose \\( x = 4 \\), then \\( y = 6 \\).\n\nTotal cost: \\( 12 \\times 4 + 8 \\times 6 = 48 + 48 = 96 \\), which is less than 100.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if \\( x = 6 \\), then \\( y = 4 \\).\n\nTotal cost: \\( 12 \\times 6 + 8 \\times 4 = 72 + 32 = 104 \\), which is more than 100.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo, the only combination that works is \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( y = 5 \\).\n\nAlternatively, we could have used elimination method to solve the system of equations.\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 8:\n\n\\( 8x + 8y = 80 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n\\( (12x + 8y) - (8x + 8y) = 100 - 80 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 4x = 20 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 5 \\), and then \\( y = 5 \\), same as before.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the average cost per item.\n\nTotal cost is $100 for 10 items, so average cost per item is $10.\n\nType A costs $12, Type B costs $8.\n\nSo, the average cost is right in the middle at $10, which suggests an equal number of each type.\n\nIndeed, \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y = 5 \\) matches this intuition.\n\nAlternatively, if the average was closer to $12, we'd have more Type A items, and vice versa.\n\nBut in this case, it's right in the middle, so equal numbers make sense.\n\nLet me consider if there are any constraints I missed.\n\nFor example, are there any restrictions on the number of items they can buy?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any, so I assume they can buy any non-negative integer number of each type, as long as the total number is 10 and the total cost is $100.\n\nAlso, since we're dealing with items, fractional items don't make sense, so \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be integers.\n\nIn this case, \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( y = 5 \\) are both integers, so that's fine.\n\nIs there a way to generalize this approach for similar problems?\n\nYes, for problems involving two variables, setting up a system of equations based on the given information and solving them using substitution or elimination is a standard approach.\n\nIn some cases, considering the average or thinking about the weighted average can provide a quicker path to the solution, as I did earlier.\n\nBut for more complex problems with more variables, sticking to algebraic methods might be necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, the customer bought 5 items of Type A and 5 items of Type B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ items of Type A and } 5 \\text{ items of Type B}} \\]"
