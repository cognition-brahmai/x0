So, if someone invests $10,000 in a savings account that has an annual interest rate of 3%, and the interest is compounded quarterly, we want to know how much money they'll have after 5 years.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what \"compounded quarterly\" means. When interest is compounded quarterly, it means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal amount four times a year, every three months.\n\nThe formula to calculate the future value of an investment with compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- \\( P = 10,000 \\) dollars\n\n- \\( r = 3\\% = 0.03 \\) (as a decimal)\n\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (since interest is compounded quarterly)\n\n- \\( t = 5 \\) years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 10,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.03}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 5} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.03}{4} = 0.0075 \\]\n\nThen, add 1 to this rate:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0.0075 = 1.0075 \\]\n\nNext, raise this to the power of \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.0075^{20} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 1.0075^{20} \\):\n\nUsing a calculator, \\( 1.0075^{20} \\approx 1.161834236 \\)\n\nNow, multiply this by the principal amount:\n\n\\[ A = 10,000 \\times 1.161834236 \\approx 11,618.34 \\]\n\nTherefore, after 5 years, the investment would grow to approximately $11,618.34.\n\nIt's always a good idea to double-check calculations, especially with exponents, so feel free to verify this with a financial calculator or an online compound interest calculator.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this is a simplified model and doesn't account for factors like inflation or changes in the interest rate over time. But for a basic calculation, this should give a good estimate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11618.34} \\]"
