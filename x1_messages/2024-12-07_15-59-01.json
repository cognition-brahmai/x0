        "content": "Let's see here. So, we have a train that's moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. It takes 2 hours to get from Station A to Station B. Now, Station C is twice as far away from Station A as Station B is. I need to figure out how long it would take to get from Station A to Station C.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the distance between Station A and Station B. Since speed is 60 mph and time is 2 hours, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, Distance from A to B = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, Station C is twice as far away from Station A as Station B, which means the distance from A to C is twice the distance from A to B.\n\nTherefore, Distance from A to C = 2 \u00d7 120 miles = 240 miles.\n\nNow, the train is still moving at the same constant speed of 60 mph. I need to find out how long it takes to cover 240 miles at 60 mph.\n\nAgain, using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, Time from A to C = 240 miles / 60 mph = 4 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward. But let me double-check.\n\nIf the train goes 60 miles in one hour, then for 120 miles, it would take 2 hours, which matches the given information. Now, since Station C is twice as far, that would be 240 miles, so it should take 4 hours.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should consider if there are any stops or something, but the question doesn't mention anything like that. It says the train travels at a constant speed, so I think it's safe to assume it's just moving steadily without stopping.\n\nAnother way to think about it: since the distance is twice as much, and speed is constant, time should also be twice as much. Given that A to B takes 2 hours, A to C should take 4 hours.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using ratios.\n\nDistance A to B: 120 miles, Time: 2 hours.\n\nDistance A to C: 240 miles, Time: ?\n\nSo, the ratio of distances is 240/120 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the time should also be twice as much, which is 2 \u00d7 2 hours = 4 hours.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, using the speed formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nWe know Speed and Distance from A to C, so Time = Distance / Speed.\n\nTime from A to C = 240 miles / 60 mph = 4 hours.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer is 4 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the train's speed changes or if there are any other factors, but the question clearly states that the train travels at a constant speed of 60 mph. So, no need to worry about acceleration or anything like that.\n\nAlso, assuming that the track is a straight line and there are no diversions or changes in speed limits.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes to travel from Station A to Station C is 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
