He is indeed famous for his fantasy novels, including \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" series, which feature a character named Bilbo Baggins. Additionally, Tolkien worked as a codebreaker during World War I, not World War II. He was involved in cryptographic work for the British military during World War I, specifically in the development of codes and ciphers. So, while he did contribute to codebreaking efforts, it was during the earlier global conflict."
