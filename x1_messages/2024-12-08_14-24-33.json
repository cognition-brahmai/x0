        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 4(3x - 5) = 8. Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to remember the order of operations, but since this is an equation, I'll be working to isolate x. So, starting with the left side, there's a 4 being multiplied by (3x - 5). Maybe I should use the distributive property here.\n\nSo, 4 times 3x is 12x, and 4 times -5 is -20. So, the equation becomes:\n\n12x - 20 = 8.\n\nAlright, now I need to get all the terms with x on one side and the constants on the other. I can start by adding 20 to both sides to get rid of the -20 on the left.\n\n12x - 20 + 20 = 8 + 20.\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n12x = 28.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 12.\n\nx = 28 / 12.\n\nHmm, that can be simplified. Both 28 and 12 are divisible by 4.\n\nSo, 28 divided by 4 is 7, and 12 divided by 4 is 3.\n\nTherefore, x = 7/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again. 12x = 28, divided by 12, yes, x = 28/12, which simplifies to 7/3.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe I should check if this is correct by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nSo, original equation: 4(3x - 5) = 8.\n\nPlug in x = 7/3:\n\n4(3*(7/3) - 5) = 4*(7 - 5) = 4*2 = 8.\n\nOkay, that checks out. So, x = 7/3 is the correct solution.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this differently. For example, I could have divided both sides by 4 first.\n\nStarting again with 4(3x - 5) = 8.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n(4(3x - 5))/4 = 8/4.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x - 5 = 2.\n\nNow, add 5 to both sides:\n\n3x - 5 + 5 = 2 + 5.\n\nSo, 3x = 7.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 7/3.\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The solution is x = 7/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{3}} \\]"
