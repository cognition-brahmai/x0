        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 10 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. We need to figure out how many handshakes that amounts to in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many people there are and how many handshakes each one participates in. If there are 10 people, then each person shakes hands with 9 others, right? Because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nSo, if each of the 10 people shakes hands with 9 others, that would suggest a total of 10 times 9, which is 90 handshakes. But wait, that seems too high. I think I'm double-counting here because when person A shakes hands with person B, that's the same handshake as when person B shakes hands with person A. So, in my initial calculation, I've counted each handshake twice.\n\nTo correct for that, I need to divide the total by 2. So, 90 divided by 2 equals 45. Therefore, there should be 45 unique handshakes.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to think about this to confirm. Maybe using combinations. I recall that the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10 to shake hands is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of people, and k is the number of people involved in each handshake, which is 2.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result. So, it seems like 45 is the correct number of handshakes.\n\nBut let me try another approach to be sure. Suppose I think about it sequentially.\n\nStart with the first person. They shake hands with 9 others.\n\nThen, the second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 8 remaining people.\n\nThe third person has already shaken hands with the first and second, so they shake hands with 7 others, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n9 (first person) + 8 (second person) + 7 (third person) + 6 (fourth person) + 5 (fifth person) + 4 (sixth person) + 3 (seventh person) + 2 (eighth person) + 1 (ninth person) + 0 (tenth person)\n\nAdding those up: 9 + 8 = 17, 17 + 7 = 24, 24 + 6 = 30, 30 + 5 = 35, 35 + 4 = 39, 39 + 3 = 42, 42 + 2 = 44, 44 + 1 = 45, and finally 45 + 0 = 45.\n\nAgain, I get 45 handshakes.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using graph theory. If each person is a node and each handshake is an edge connecting two nodes, then the total number of handshakes would be equal to the number of edges in a complete graph with 10 nodes.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n nodes is C(n, 2), which is the same as n(n-1)/2.\n\nPlugging in n=10: 10 \u00d7 9 / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nOnce more, 45 handshakes.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it through multiple methods: the initial double-counting approach, the combination formula, the sequential addition, and graph theory. All of these methods lead me to the same conclusion that there are 45 unique handshakes when 10 people each shake hands with every other person exactly once.\n\nI feel confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
