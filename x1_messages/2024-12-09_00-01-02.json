        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a subcommittee with specific conditions. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. We have a committee of 5 men and 7 women, and we need to form a subcommittee of 6 people, but it must include at least 3 women. Okay, so the key here is \"at least 3 women,\" which means the subcommittee could have 3, 4, 5, or even 6 women. I need to find out how many different ways this can be done.\n\nFirst, I recall that when dealing with combinations, the order doesn't matter. It's all about selecting groups of items, in this case, people, without regard to their arrangement. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nNow, since there are constraints on the number of women, I think the best approach is to consider each possible scenario separately and then add them up. So, that would be:\n\n1. Selecting exactly 3 women and 3 men.\n\n2. Selecting exactly 4 women and 2 men.\n\n3. Selecting exactly 5 women and 1 man.\n\n4. Selecting exactly 6 women and 0 men.\n\nI'll calculate each of these scenarios and then sum them up to get the total number of ways.\n\nLet's start with the first scenario: 3 women and 3 men.\n\nThere are 7 women and we need to choose 3. So, the number of ways to choose the women is C(7, 3).\n\nSimilarly, there are 5 men and we need to choose 3, so the number of ways to choose the men is C(5, 3).\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of ways for this scenario is C(7, 3) * C(5, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (6 * 4!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / 6 = 7 * 5 * 6 / 6 = 7 * 5 = 35.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's recalculate.\n\nActually, 7! is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4!, and 3! is 6, and (7 - 3)! is 4!, which is 24.\n\nSo, C(7, 3) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (6 * 24) = (7 * 6 * 5) / 6 = 7 * 5 = 35. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!) = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (6 * 2!) = (5 * 4 * 6) / (6 * 2) = (20) / 2 = 10.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's try again.\n\n5! is 120, 3! is 6, and (5 - 3)! is 2!, which is 2.\n\nSo, C(5, 3) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10. Okay, good.\n\nTherefore, for the first scenario, it's 35 * 10 = 350 ways.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: 4 women and 2 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 4 women from 7 is C(7, 4).\n\nSimilarly, number of ways to choose 2 men from 5 is C(5, 2).\n\nAgain, total ways for this scenario are C(7, 4) * C(5, 2).\n\nLet's calculate C(7, 4).\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7 - 4)!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (24 * 6) = (7 * 6 * 5) / 24 = 210 / 24 = 8.75. Wait, that can't be right. Combinations must be whole numbers.\n\nHold on, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nActually, 7! is 5040, 4! is 24, and (7 - 4)! is 3!, which is 6.\n\nSo, C(7, 4) = 5040 / (24 * 6) = 5040 / 144 = 35. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nAnd C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.\n\nTherefore, for the second scenario, it's 35 * 10 = 350 ways again.\n\nNow, third scenario: 5 women and 1 man.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 5 women from 7 is C(7, 5).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 man from 5 is C(5, 1).\n\nTotal ways for this scenario: C(7, 5) * C(5, 1).\n\nCalculating C(7, 5) = 7! / (5! * 2!) = (5040) / (120 * 2) = 5040 / 240 = 21.\n\nAnd C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nSo, 21 * 5 = 105 ways.\n\nFourth and final scenario: 6 women and 0 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 6 women from 7 is C(7, 6).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 0 men from 5 is C(5, 0).\n\nWe know that C(n, 0) is always 1, and C(7, 6) = 7.\n\nSo, total ways for this scenario: 7 * 1 = 7.\n\nNow, to get the total number of ways, I need to add up all these scenarios:\n\n350 (from scenario 1) + 350 (from scenario 2) + 105 (from scenario 3) + 7 (from scenario 4).\n\nLet's add them up: 350 + 350 = 700. Then 700 + 105 = 805. Finally, 805 + 7 = 812.\n\nSo, there are 812 different ways to form a subcommittee of 6 people with at least 3 women.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate this without considering each scenario separately? Maybe using the principle of complementary counting.\n\nComplementary counting means calculating the total number of possible subcommittees and subtracting those that don't meet the condition, i.e., those with fewer than 3 women.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose any 6 people from 12 (5 men + 7 women) is C(12, 6).\n\nNumber of ways with fewer than 3 women is the sum of:\n\n- No women (all men): C(5, 6) * C(7, 0), but since we only have 5 men, it's impossible to choose 6 men, so this is 0.\n\n- 1 woman and 5 men: C(7, 1) * C(5, 5) = 7 * 1 = 7.\n\n- 2 women and 4 men: C(7, 2) * C(5, 4) = 21 * 5 = 105.\n\nSo, total invalid subcommittees are 7 + 105 = 112.\n\nTotal possible subcommittees are C(12, 6) = 924.\n\nTherefore, number of valid subcommittees is 924 - 112 = 812.\n\nOkay, this matches the previous result. So, both methods confirm that there are 812 ways to form such a subcommittee.\n\nIt's good to see that both approaches give the same answer, which increases confidence in the result.\n\nJust to summarize, the two methods are:\n\n1. Direct counting: Adding up the number of ways for each possible number of women (3, 4, 5, 6).\n\n2. Complementary counting: Calculating total possible subcommittees and subtracting the invalid ones (with fewer than 3 women).\n\nBoth methods lead to the same answer, 812.\n\nThis problem is a good example of how combinations can be used to solve counting problems with constraints. It's important to carefully consider the conditions and choose an appropriate method to avoid errors.\n\nI think that's the solution. If there's anything else to consider, I don't see it right now. So, the final answer is 812 ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{812} \\]"
