        "content": "So the factory produces 250 units of product A each day, and each unit needs 4 hours of labor. We want to know the total hours of labor needed for 5 days.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many units are produced in 5 days. Since they make 250 units per day, for 5 days it would be:\n\n250 units/day \u00d7 5 days = 1250 units\n\nNow, each unit requires 4 hours of labor, so for 1250 units, the total labor hours would be:\n\n1250 units \u00d7 4 hours/unit = 5000 hours\n\nSo, the factory needs 5000 hours of labor to produce the product for 5 days.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If each day they spend 250 units \u00d7 4 hours = 1000 hours per day, then over 5 days it would be:\n\n1000 hours/day \u00d7 5 days = 5000 hours\n\nYeah, that matches. So, 5000 hours is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5000} \\]"
