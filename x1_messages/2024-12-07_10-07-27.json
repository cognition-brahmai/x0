One day, a young calf, Kito, wandered off, captivated by the rustling leaves. Mala sensed his absence immediately. Panic surged, but she remained calm. She communicated silently with the herd, and together, they formed a circle, searching. Kito, frightened, trumpeted softly. Mala's ears perked up. She broke from the group, following the sound. Through thick bushes and over rocky terrain, she navigated. Finally, she found Kito, tears in his eyes. Mala nuzzled him, offering comfort. The herd rejoined, safer together, under Mala's watchful gaze. Their bond unbreakable, they continued their journey, as they had for generations."
