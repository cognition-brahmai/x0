        "content": "To calculate the total revenue from candy sales in that week, I need to find out how much money was made from each type of candy and then add those amounts together.\n\nFirst, let's look at Candy X. The store sold 350 units of Candy X, each priced at $1.50. To find the revenue from Candy X, I should multiply the number of units sold by the price per unit.\n\nSo, revenue from Candy X = number of units of Candy X \u00d7 price per unit of Candy X\n= 350 \u00d7 $1.50\n\nNow, let's calculate that.\n\n350 \u00d7 1.50 = 350 \u00d7 (1 + 0.50) = 350 \u00d7 1 + 350 \u00d7 0.50 = 350 + 175 = 525\n\nSo, the revenue from Candy X is $525.\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from Candy Y. The store sold 200 units of Candy Y, each priced at $2.00.\n\nRevenue from Candy Y = number of units of Candy Y \u00d7 price per unit of Candy Y\n= 200 \u00d7 $2.00\n= 400\n\nSo, the revenue from Candy Y is $400.\n\nNow, to find the total revenue from both types of candies, I need to add the revenue from Candy X and the revenue from Candy Y together.\n\nTotal revenue = revenue from Candy X + revenue from Candy Y\n= $525 + $400\n= $925\n\nTherefore, the total revenue from candy sales in that week is $925.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{925} \\]"
