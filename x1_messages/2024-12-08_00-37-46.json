        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a survey on fruit preferences. There are three fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. The survey gives me some numbers about how many people liked each fruit individually, how many liked pairs of fruits, and how many liked all three. My goal is to find out how many people were surveyed in total.\n\nLet me start by listing out the information given:\n\n- 12 people liked apples.\n\n- 8 people liked bananas.\n\n- 6 people liked oranges.\n\n- 4 people liked both apples and bananas.\n\n- 3 people liked both apples and oranges.\n\n- 2 people liked both bananas and oranges.\n\n- 1 person liked all three fruits.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic problem in set theory, specifically dealing with overlapping sets. I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for three sets. The total number of people who liked at least one of the fruits is given by:\n\nTotal = Number who liked apples + Number who liked bananas + Number who liked oranges - Number who liked both apples and bananas - Number who liked both apples and oranges - Number who liked both bananas and oranges + Number who liked all three.\n\nWait, why are we adding back the number who liked all three? That's because when we subtract the intersections of two sets, we also subtract the intersection of all three sets three times (once for each pair), but the intersection of all three is only supposed to be subtracted once. So, we need to add it back to compensate.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal = 12 (apples) + 8 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) - 4 (apples and bananas) - 3 (apples and oranges) - 2 (bananas and oranges) + 1 (all three).\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, add the individual preferences:\n\n12 + 8 + 6 = 26.\n\nNext, subtract the pairwise overlaps:\n\n26 - 4 - 3 - 2 = 17.\n\nFinally, add back the intersection of all three:\n\n17 + 1 = 18.\n\nSo, according to this, 18 people liked at least one of the fruits.\n\nBut the question is, how many people were surveyed? Does that include only those who liked at least one fruit, or does it include people who may have liked none of the fruits?\n\nWait a minute, the problem says, \"a group of people were asked about their preferences for three types of fruits...\" and it gives the numbers of people who liked certain fruits or combinations thereof, but it doesn't specify whether there were people who didn't like any of the fruits.\n\nIf the survey asked everyone about their preferences, then the total number of people surveyed would be the number who liked at least one fruit plus the number who didn't like any of the fruits.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't mention anyone who didn't like any fruits, perhaps we can assume that everyone liked at least one fruit. In that case, the total number surveyed would be 18.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the possibility that there were people who didn't like any of the fruits. If that's the case, then the total number surveyed would be greater than 18.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide any information about people who didn't like any fruits, and it asks for the number of people surveyed, I think the safest assumption is that everyone liked at least one fruit, unless stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the total number of people surveyed being 18.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle again:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A\u2229B) - (A\u2229C) - (B\u2229C) + (A\u2229B\u2229C).\n\nPlugging in:\n\nA = 12, B = 8, C = 6.\n\nA\u2229B = 4, A\u2229C = 3, B\u2229C = 2, A\u2229B\u2229C = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal = 12 + 8 + 6 - 4 - 3 - 2 + 1 = 18.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine three circles overlapping: one for apples, one for bananas, and one for oranges.\n\n- The number who like only apples would be 12 minus those who like apples and something else.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nOnly apples: 12 - (4 + 3 - 1) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nWait, hold on. The 4 who like both apples and bananas include the 1 who likes all three, similarly, the 3 who like both apples and oranges include the 1 who likes all three, and the 2 who like both bananas and oranges include the 1 who likes all three.\n\nSo, to find the number who like only apples and bananas but not oranges, it would be 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, only apples and oranges but not bananas: 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nOnly bananas and oranges but not apples: 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nOnly apples: 12 - (4 + 3 - 1) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nOnly bananas: 8 - (4 + 2 - 1) = 8 - 5 = 3.\n\nOnly oranges: 6 - (3 + 2 - 1) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nAnd those who like all three: 1.\n\nNow, adding all these up:\n\nOnly apples: 6\n\nOnly bananas: 3\n\nOnly oranges: 2\n\nOnly apples and bananas: 3\n\nOnly apples and oranges: 2\n\nOnly bananas and oranges: 1\n\nAll three: 1\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 18.\n\nAgain, I get 18.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 18 people were surveyed.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any possibility of people who don't like any fruits. The problem doesn't mention them, so probably, the survey only included people who have a preference for at least one of the fruits.\n\nTherefore, the number of people surveyed is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
