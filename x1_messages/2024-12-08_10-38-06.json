The total costs include both the variable costs (cost per widget) and the fixed costs.\n\nLet's denote the number of widgets sold as \\( x \\).\n\nThe total revenue (R) from selling \\( x \\) widgets is:\n\\[ R = 15x \\]\n\nThe total cost (C) of producing \\( x \\) widgets is:\n\\[ C = 8x + 5000 \\]\n\nAt the break-even point, revenue equals costs:\n\\[ 15x = 8x + 5000 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we can subtract \\( 8x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 15x - 8x = 5000 \\]\n\\[ 7x = 5000 \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[ x = \\frac{5000}{7} \\]\n\\[ x \\approx 714.2857 \\]\n\nSince the company can't sell a fraction of a widget, they need to sell at least 715 widgets to cover their costs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{715} \\]"
