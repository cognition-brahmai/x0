Some studies suggest that plants respond positively to certain frequencies and vibrations, which might be similar to what music provides. However, I think it's important to approach this with a critical mindset and look for scientific evidence to support or refute this claim. Maybe I can look up some research papers or experiments that have been conducted on this topic."
