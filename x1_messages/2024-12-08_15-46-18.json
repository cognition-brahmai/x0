        "content": "Let's see. There's a store having a sale where everything is discounted by 20%. I have an item that originally costs $80, and I want to know how much I'll save if I buy it during the sale.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Percentage discount is a reduction in the price of a product or service, expressed as a percentage of the original price. So, if something is 20% off, that means I pay 20% less than the original price.\n\nTo find out how much I save, I need to calculate 20% of $80. The formula for the discount amount is:\n\nDiscount Amount = (Discount Rate / 100) \u00d7 Original Price\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nDiscount Amount = (20 / 100) \u00d7 80\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nDiscount Amount = 0.2 \u00d7 80\n\nMultiplying that out:\n\nDiscount Amount = 16\n\nSo, I save $16 on the item if I buy it during the sale.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Another way to look at it is to calculate the sale price and then see the difference from the original price.\n\nIf the discount is 20%, then the sale price is 80% of the original price, because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, Sale Price = (80 / 100) \u00d7 Original Price\n\nSale Price = 0.8 \u00d7 80\n\nSale Price = 64\n\nOriginal Price - Sale Price = 80 - 64 = 16\n\nAgain, I save $16. That makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also verify this using decimal operations.\n\n20% as a decimal is 0.2.\n\nMultiplying 0.2 by 80 gives me 16.\n\nYes, that's consistent across different methods.\n\nI think I've got it right. The savings amount is $16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
