Why don't dinosaurs play cards in the wild? Because there are too many cheetahs!\n\n2. Why did the dinosaur go to the dentist? To get its teeth roasted!\n\n3. What do you call a dinosaur with no eyes? Doyouthinkhesawit.\n\n4. Why did the dinosaur cross the road? To get to the Jurassics!\n\n5. What do you call a group of dinosaurs standing in a circle? A T-Rex-gon.\n\nI hope these bring a smile to your face!"
