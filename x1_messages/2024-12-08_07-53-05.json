So, when it rains and the sun comes out again, sometimes we see a beautiful arc in the sky with all these colors like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Right? That's called a rainbow. So, to answer your question, the natural phenomenon you're referring to is a rainbow. It's caused by the way light interacts with water droplets in the air. The light gets bent, or refracted, as it enters the droplet, then reflects off the inside of the droplet, and bends again as it exits. This process separates the light into its different colors, which is called dispersion. That's why we see all those colors in a rainbow. It's such a fascinating and beautiful sight!"
