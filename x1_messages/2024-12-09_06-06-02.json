I remember that when interest is compounded annually, there's a specific formula to calculate the future value of the investment. The formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, since the interest is compounded annually, \\( n = 1 \\). The principal \\( P \\) is $5,000, the annual interest rate \\( r \\) is 6% or 0.06, and the time \\( t \\) is 5 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{1}\\right)^{1 \\times 5} \\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.06\\right)^5 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1.06\\right)^5 \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( (1.06)^5 \\). I can do this by multiplying 1.06 by itself five times, or I can use a calculator for precision. Let's calculate it step by step:\n\nFirst, \\( 1.06 \\times 1.06 = 1.1236 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 1.1236 \\times 1.06 = 1.191016 \\)\n\nNext, \\( 1.191016 \\times 1.06 = 1.26247696 \\)\n\nAnd finally, \\( 1.26247696 \\times 1.06 = 1.3382255576 \\)\n\nSo, \\( (1.06)^5 \\approx 1.3382 \\)\n\nNow, multiplying this by the principal amount:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.3382 = 6691 \\]\n\nWait, let's make sure of that multiplication. 5000 times 1.3382 should be 5000 times 1 is 5000, plus 5000 times 0.3382, which is 1691, so total 6691. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a calculator for \\( (1.06)^5 \\), I get approximately 1.3382255776, and multiplying that by 5000 gives 6691.127888, which rounds to $6,691.13.\n\nBut let's check if there's a more precise way or if I'm missing something. I recall that some financial calculations round differently, but in this case, since we're dealing with dollars and cents, rounding to two decimal places should be fine.\n\nSo, after 5 years, the investment would grow to approximately $6,691.13.\n\nWait a minute, but I think there's a simpler formula for compound interest when compounded annually. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, when interest is compounded annually, the formula simplifies to:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nBecause \\( n = 1 \\), so \\( \\frac{r}{n} = r \\) and \\( nt = t \\). So, plugging in the values again:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 (1 + 0.06)^5 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 (1.06)^5 \\]\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, no mistake there.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can calculate it using simple interest and see the difference. With simple interest, the formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + rt) \\]\n\nSo, for simple interest:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 (1 + 0.06 \\times 5) \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 (1 + 0.3) \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.3 = 6500 \\]\n\nSo, with compound interest, it's $6,691.13, and with simple interest, it's $6,500. That shows the effect of compounding over time.\n\nAlso, I should note that in some financial contexts, interest might be compounded more frequently than annually, like quarterly or monthly, which would affect the final amount. But in this case, since it's compounded annually, the formula I used is appropriate.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect the calculation. For example, are there any fees or additional deposits? The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it's a straightforward compound interest scenario.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the amount year by year, applying the interest each time. Let's try that to verify.\n\nStarting with $5,000.\n\nAfter the first year:\n\n\\[ 5000 + (0.06 \\times 5000) = 5000 + 300 = 5300 \\]\n\nAfter the second year:\n\n\\[ 5300 + (0.06 \\times 5300) = 5300 + 318 = 5618 \\]\n\nAfter the third year:\n\n\\[ 5618 + (0.06 \\times 5618) = 5618 + 337.08 = 5955.08 \\]\n\nAfter the fourth year:\n\n\\[ 5955.08 + (0.06 \\times 5955.08) = 5955.08 + 357.3048 = 6312.3848 \\]\n\nAfter the fifth year:\n\n\\[ 6312.3848 + (0.06 \\times 6312.3848) = 6312.3848 + 378.743088 = 6691.127888 \\]\n\nWhich rounds to $6,691.13, matching my earlier calculation. So, that's reassuring.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently. The key takeaway is that with compound interest, your earnings grow exponentially over time because you earn interest on both the principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. That's why the final amount is higher than what you'd get with simple interest.\n\nIn summary, if you invest $5,000 at an annual interest rate of 6% compounded annually, after 5 years, you will have approximately $6,691.13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6691.13} \\]"
