        "content": "Let's see. The factory can produce either 100 small widgets or 50 large widgets in one hour. So, if it spends some hours making small widgets and some hours making large ones, I need to figure out how many hours in total it will take to produce 400 small widgets and 200 large widgets.\n\nLet me denote the number of hours spent on producing small widgets as \\( h_s \\) and the number of hours spent on producing large widgets as \\( h_l \\). Then, the total production of small widgets would be \\( 100 \\times h_s \\) and the total production of large widgets would be \\( 50 \\times h_l \\).\n\nGiven that the factory needs to produce 400 small widgets and 200 large widgets, I can set up the following equations:\n\n\\[ 100 h_s = 400 \\]\n\n\\[ 50 h_l = 200 \\]\n\nNow, I can solve each equation for \\( h_s \\) and \\( h_l \\).\n\nFirst, solving for \\( h_s \\):\n\n\\[ h_s = \\frac{400}{100} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, solving for \\( h_l \\):\n\n\\[ h_l = \\frac{200}{50} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the factory needs to spend 4 hours on small widgets and 4 hours on large widgets, totaling 8 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way to produce both types of widgets simultaneously or perhaps switch between them in a more optimized way? The problem states that in one hour, the factory can produce either 100 small widgets or 50 large widgets. It seems like the factory can't produce both types at the same time; it has to choose one or the other each hour.\n\nTherefore, the total time required is simply the sum of the hours needed for each type of widget, which is 4 hours for small plus 4 hours for large, equaling 8 hours.\n\nBut let me think if there's another approach. Maybe there's a way to produce both types in a mixed manner each hour, but the problem doesn't suggest that's possible. It clearly says \"either 100 small widgets or 50 large widgets\" per hour.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total production capacity needed. The factory needs to produce a total of 400 small widgets and 200 large widgets. If we consider the production rates, making small widgets is faster in terms of number per hour, but large widgets take more time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the production rates and find a combined rate, but since the factory can't produce both types simultaneously, it's probably best to keep them separate.\n\nLet me consider if there is any overlap or if the factory can switch between producing small and large widgets during the hours in a way that optimizes time, but based on the information given, it seems like the factory has to dedicate entire hours to one type or the other.\n\nTherefore, the straightforward approach seems correct: 4 hours for small widgets and 4 hours for large widgets, totaling 8 hours.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think about the production in terms of the number of widgets per hour, considering both types.\n\nIf the factory spends \\( h \\) hours producing small widgets and \\( k \\) hours producing large widgets, then:\n\n\\[ 100h = 400 \\]\n\n\\[ 50k = 200 \\]\n\nSolving these separately gives \\( h = 4 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\), so total time is \\( h + k = 8 \\) hours.\n\nIs there a way to reduce this time? Perhaps if the factory could produce both types at the same time, but again, the problem doesn't indicate that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more efficient scheduling approach, but given the constraints, I don't see how.\n\nLet me try another angle. Suppose the factory first produces all the small widgets and then the large ones. It would take 4 hours for the small widgets and another 4 hours for the large ones, totaling 8 hours.\n\nAlternatively, it could alternate between producing small and large widgets, but that would still amount to the same total time, as there's no overlapping of production.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to produce both types simultaneously in a single hour, but the problem states that in one hour, it can produce either 100 small widgets or 50 large widgets, implying that it can't do both at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the total time required is indeed 8 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the factory can multi-task or adjust production rates, but the problem doesn't provide any information suggesting that's possible.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there's a way to prioritize one type of widget over the other to minimize total production time, but again, since the production rates are fixed and the factory can only choose one type per hour, the total time remains the same.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take the factory 8 hours to produce 400 small widgets and 200 large widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
