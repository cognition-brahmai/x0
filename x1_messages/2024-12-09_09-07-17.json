        "content": "Let's see. So, there are three friends who decide to share a large pizza equally. The pizza has 12 slices, and after they've eaten their shares, there are still 3 slices left. I need to figure out how many slices each friend ate.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many slices were eaten in total. The pizza had 12 slices, and there are 3 left, so the number of slices eaten is 12 minus 3, which is 9 slices.\n\nNow, these 9 slices were shared equally among three friends. So, to find out how many slices each friend ate, I need to divide the total slices eaten by the number of friends.\n\nThat is, 9 slices divided by 3 friends.\n\n9 divided by 3 is 3.\n\nSo, each friend ate 3 slices.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If each friend ate 3 slices, and there are three friends, then total slices eaten would be 3 times 3, which is 9. And the pizza had 12 slices, so 12 minus 9 is 3 slices left, which matches the problem.\n\nSo, yes, each friend ate 3 slices.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
