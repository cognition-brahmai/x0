        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. In Python, you can compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the math module, which has a built-in function called gcd(). However, if you want to implement it from scratch, you can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\nHere's how you can do it using the math module:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n```\n\nIf you prefer to implement it without using the built-in function, here's an example using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\nBoth of these functions will give you the GCD of two numbers. The second implementation is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number by the remainder of the division of the two numbers until one of them becomes zero. The non-zero remainder at that point is the GCD.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!"
