        "content": "So the city has a population of 1 million people. That's a big city! Okay, first, it says that 55% of the population owns a car. So, to find out how many people that is, I need to calculate 55% of 1 million.\n\nLet me think: 55% of 1,000,000. Well, 50% would be half a million, which is 500,000. And 5% of 1,000,000 is 50,000. So, 500,000 plus 50,000 is 550,000. So, 550,000 people own a car.\n\nNext, it says that 30% of those who own a car also own a motorcycle. So, I need to find out what 30% of 550,000 is.\n\nLet's see: 10% of 550,000 is 55,000. So, 30% would be three times that, which is 165,000.\n\nTherefore, 165,000 people own both a car and a motorcycle.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Like, maybe some people own only a car or only a motorcycle, but the question is specifically asking for those who own both.\n\nI think the way I did it is correct. First, find the number of people who own a car, which is 55% of 1 million, which is 550,000. Then, 30% of those car owners also own a motorcycle, so 30% of 550,000 is 165,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be 165,000 people own both a car and a motorcycle.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any overlap or other factors I might have missed. The question doesn't mention anything about people owning more than two vehicles or any other conditions. It's straightforward: find how many own both a car and a motorcycle, given that 55% own a car and 30% of those also own a motorcycle.\n\nYes, I think 165,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165000} \\]"
