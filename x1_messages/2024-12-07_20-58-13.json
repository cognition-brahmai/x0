        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a Python script that interacts with a Memcached server. We'll cover connecting to the server, storing key-value pairs, retrieving values by keys, and deleting entries based on a condition, like deleting all entries where the value is greater than 100.\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to have Memcached installed and running on your server. Make sure it's up and running before you proceed.\n\nNext, you'll need to install the `pymemcache` library in Python, which allows us to interact with the Memcached server. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pymemcache\n```\n\nNow, let's start writing the script step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Connecting to the Memcached Server\n\nWe need to establish a connection to the Memcached server. Assuming your Memcached server is running locally on the default port (11211), here's how you can connect:\n\n```python\nfrom pymemcache.client.base import Client\n\n# Create a client and connect to the Memcached server\nclient = Client(('localhost', 11211))\n```\n\nIf your Memcached server is running on a different host or port, adjust the parameters accordingly.\n\n### Step 2: Storing Key-Value Pairs\n\nOnce connected, you can store key-value pairs using the `set` method. Keys and values should be bytes or strings (which will be encoded to bytes).\n\n```python\n# Storing key-value pairs\nclient.set('key1', 'value1')\nclient.set('key2', 'value2')\nclient.set('key3', 150)  # Storing an integer, it will be stored as a string\n```\n\nNote that integers and other data types are stored as strings, so you might need to handle type conversions when retrieving them.\n\n### Step 3: Retrieving Values by Keys\n\nTo retrieve values, use the `get` method with the key.\n\n```python\n# Retrieving values\nvalue1 = client.get('key1')\nvalue2 = client.get('key2')\nvalue3 = client.get('key3')\n\nprint(value1)  # Output: b'value1'\nprint(value2)  # Output: b'value2'\nprint(value3)  # Output: b'150'\n```\n\nValues are returned as bytes, so you might want to decode them to strings or convert them to appropriate types.\n\n### Step 4: Deleting Entries Based on a Condition\n\nDeleting entries based on a condition requires fetching all keys, checking the condition, and deleting if necessary. However, Memcached doesn't support direct deletion based on value conditions out of the box, so we need to handle this programmatically.\n\nFirst, fetch all keys. Note that `pymemcache` doesn't provide a direct way to get all keys, but you can use the `stats items` command to get an idea of the slabs and then list keys in those slabs. Alternatively, you can keep track of the keys you've stored in your application.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume you have a list of keys to check.\n\n```python\n# List of keys to check\nkeys_to_check = ['key1', 'key2', 'key3']\n\n# Delete entries where the value is greater than 100\nfor key in keys_to_check:\n    value = client.get(key)\n    if value is not None:\n        # Assuming values are integers for this condition\n        value_int = int(value.decode('utf-8'))\n        if value_int > 100:\n            client.delete(key)\n            print(f'Deleted {key}')\n```\n\nIn this example, we're assuming that the values are integers. We decode the bytes to a string and then convert to an integer to check the condition.\n\n### Complete Script\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete script:\n\n```python\nfrom pymemcache.client.base import Client\n\ndef main():\n    # Connect to Memcached server\n    client = Client(('localhost', 11211))\n    \n    # Store key-value pairs\n    client.set('key1', '50')\n    client.set('key2', '200')\n    client.set('key3', '150')\n    \n    # Retrieve and print values\n    print(client.get('key1'))  # Output: b'50'\n    print(client.get('key2'))  # Output: b'200'\n    print(client.get('key3'))  # Output: b'150'\n    \n    # List of keys to check\n    keys_to_check = ['key1', 'key2', 'key3']\n    \n    # Delete entries where the value is greater than 100\n    for key in keys_to_check:\n        value = client.get(key)\n        if value is not None:\n            value_int = int(value.decode('utf-8'))\n            if value_int > 100:\n                client.delete(key)\n                print(f'Deleted {key}')\n    \n    # Verify deletions\n    print(client.get('key1'))  # Should still be there\n    print(client.get('key2'))  # Should be deleted\n    print(client.get('key3'))  # Should be deleted\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connection**: We connect to the Memcached server running locally.\n2. **Storing**: We store three key-value pairs, assuming values are strings representing integers.\n3. **Retrieving**: We retrieve and print the values to verify they're stored correctly.\n4. **Deleting**: We check each key's value; if the value is greater than 100, we delete the key.\n5. **Verification**: We retrieve the keys again to confirm that the appropriate entries have been deleted.\n\nThis script should give you a good starting point for interacting with Memcached using Python. You can expand upon this by handling more complex data types, error checking, and more sophisticated conditions."
