        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that analyzes web server log files. The goal is to parse these logs, extract details about HTTP requests like IP address, request method, URL, and response code, and then generate a summary report with some statistics. Specifically, the report should show the number of requests per IP address, the most frequent URLs, and the distribution of response codes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of these log files. Typically, web server logs follow a standard format, like the Common Log Format (CLF), which looks something like this:\n\n```\nIP_address - - [date_time] \"request\" status_code bytes\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n123.123.123.123 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:34:56 +0000] \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" 200 1024\n```\n\nFrom this line, I can see that:\n\n- `123.123.123.123` is the IP address.\n\n- `- -` indicates no user authentication information.\n\n- `[24/Oct/2023:12:34:56 +0000]` is the date and time of the request.\n\n- `\"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\"` is the request method, URL, and protocol.\n\n- `200` is the HTTP status code.\n\n- `1024` is the size of the response in bytes.\n\nGiven this format, I need to parse each line of the log file to extract the required information.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Read the log file:** I need to read the log file line by line. In Java, I can use `BufferedReader` for this purpose.\n\n2. **Parse each line:** I need to parse each line to extract the IP address, request method, URL, and response code. Given the format, I can use string splitting and regex to extract these components.\n\n3. **Store the extracted data:** I need to store this information in a suitable data structure for further analysis. For example, I can use maps to keep track of requests per IP, frequency of URLs, and distribution of response codes.\n\n4. **Generate summary statistics:** Using the stored data, I need to generate the required statistics.\n\n5. **Output the report:** Finally, I need to print or save the summary report.\n\nLet me think about the data structures I'll use:\n\n- For counting requests per IP address, I can use a `HashMap<String, Integer>`, where the key is the IP address and the value is the count of requests.\n\n- For the most frequent URLs, I can use another `HashMap<String, Integer>`, with the URL as the key and the request count as the value. I can then sort this map by value to find the most frequent URLs.\n\n- For the distribution of response codes, I can use a `HashMap<Integer, Integer>`, with the response code as the key and the count of that code as the value.\n\nI also need to handle possible errors, such as missing fields or lines that don't conform to the expected format.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the program:\n\n- **Main class:** `LogAnalyzer`\n\n- **Methods:**\n\n  - `readLogFile(String filePath)`: Reads the log file line by line.\n\n  - `parseLogLine(String line)`: Parses a single log line and extracts relevant information.\n\n  - `updateStatistics(String ip, String method, String url, int statusCode)`: Updates the internal statistics maps.\n\n  - `generateReport()`: Generates and prints the summary report.\n\n- **Data structures:**\n\n  - `Map<String, Integer> requestsPerIP`\n\n  - `Map<String, Integer> urlFrequency`\n\n  - `Map<Integer, Integer> responseCodeDistribution`\n\nNow, I need to think about how to parse the log line. Given the CLF format, I can split the line by spaces and extract the required fields based on their positions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The first field is the IP address.\n\n- The seventh field is the status code.\n\n- The request information is within quotes in the sixth field.\n\nI need to be careful with this approach because if any field is missing or if there are extra spaces, the parsing might fail. To make it more robust, I can use regular expressions to match the expected patterns.\n\nLet me attempt to create a regex pattern for the log line.\n\nA typical CLF line is:\n\n```\nIP_address - - [date_time] \"request\" status_code bytes\n```\n\nI can break it down as follows:\n\n- `IP_address`: `\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}`\n\n- `- -`: These are fixed strings indicating no user authentication.\n\n- `[date_time]`: `[([^]]+)`\n\n- `\"request\"`: `\"([^\"]+)\"`\n\n- `status_code`: `\\d{3}`\n\n- `bytes`: `\\d+`\n\nPutting it all together, the regex pattern could be:\n\n```\n(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}) - - \\[([^\\]]+)\\] \"([^\"]+)\" (\\d{3}) (\\d+)\n```\n\nI can use this pattern to match and extract the required information from each log line.\n\nNow, considering that the request part contains the method, URL, and protocol, I need to further parse this part.\n\nFor example, from `\"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\"`, I can split by spaces to get \"GET\", \"/index.html\", and \"HTTP/1.1\".\n\nI need to handle cases where the request line might be different, but assuming standard HTTP requests, this should work.\n\nI should also consider that some logs might have different formats, but for now, I'll stick with CLF.\n\nLet me think about error handling. If a line doesn't match the expected pattern, I should skip it or log an error message.\n\nAlso, I need to handle cases where the status code is not a three-digit number.\n\nI should also consider that the log file might be large, so I need to read it efficiently without loading the entire file into memory at once.\n\nUsing `BufferedReader` is a good choice for this.\n\nNow, for generating the summary report:\n\n- **Number of requests per IP address:** I can iterate through the `requestsPerIP` map and print each IP with its count.\n\n- **Most frequent URLs:** I can sort the `urlFrequency` map by values in descending order and print the top N URLs.\n\n- **Distribution of response codes:** I can iterate through the `responseCodeDistribution` map and print each status code with its count.\n\nI need to decide how many top URLs to display. Maybe take it as an input from the user, say top 10.\n\nI should also calculate and display total number of requests, unique IP addresses, etc., for a comprehensive report.\n\nLet me think about the user interface. Since this is a command-line program, I can accept the log file path as a command-line argument.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\njava LogAnalyzer access_log\n```\n\nI should also handle cases where the file doesn't exist or can't be read.\n\nI can display an error message and exit the program in such cases.\n\nLet me also consider adding some options, like specifying the number of top URLs to display, but for simplicity, I'll hardcode it to 10 for now.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the `parseLogLine` method.\n\nI'll use the regex pattern I defined earlier.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\n```java\nPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\n    \"(\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}) - - \\\\[([^\\]]+)\\\\] \\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\" (\\\\d{3}) (\\\\d+)\"\n);\n\nMatcher matcher = pattern.matcher(line);\n\nif (matcher.matches()) {\n    String ip = matcher.group(1);\n    String dateTime = matcher.group(2);\n    String request = matcher.group(3);\n    String statusCodeStr = matcher.group(4);\n    String bytesStr = matcher.group(5);\n\n    // Further parse the request string\n    String[] requestParts = request.split(\" \");\n    if (requestParts.length == 3) {\n        String method = requestParts[0];\n        String url = requestParts[1];\n        String protocol = requestParts[2];\n\n        // Convert status code to integer\n        int statusCode = Integer.parseInt(statusCodeStr);\n\n        // Now, call updateStatistics with these values\n        updateStatistics(ip, method, url, statusCode);\n    } else {\n        // Invalid request format, skip this line\n        System.err.println(\"Invalid request format: \" + request);\n    }\n} else {\n    // Line doesn't match the expected format, skip\n    System.err.println(\"Skipping invalid log line: \" + line);\n}\n```\n\nThis seems reasonable. Now, for the `updateStatistics` method:\n\n```java\nprivate void updateStatistics(String ip, String method, String url, int statusCode) {\n    // Update requests per IP\n    requestsPerIP.put(ip, requestsPerIP.getOrDefault(ip, 0) + 1);\n\n    // Update URL frequency\n    urlFrequency.put(url, urlFrequency.getOrDefault(url, 0) + 1);\n\n    // Update response code distribution\n    responseCodeDistribution.put(statusCode, responseCodeDistribution.getOrDefault(statusCode, 0) + 1);\n}\n```\n\nSimple and straightforward.\n\nNow, for generating the report, I need to sort the maps appropriately.\n\nFor example, to get the top URLs, I can sort the `urlFrequency` map by values in descending order.\n\nIn Java, I can do this by converting the map to a list of entries and then sorting that list.\n\nHere's a sketch for the URL frequency report:\n\n```java\nList<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> urlList = new ArrayList<>(urlFrequency.entrySet());\nurlList.sort(Map.Entry.<String, Integer>comparingByValue().reversed());\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Top 10 Most Frequent URLs:\");\nint count = 0;\nfor (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : urlList) {\n    if (count >= 10) break;\n    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \" - \" + entry.getValue());\n    count++;\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, for the other statistics.\n\nI should also calculate the total number of requests, which can be the sum of all values in `requestsPerIP` or `urlFrequency`.\n\nLet me think about adding a method to calculate the total requests.\n\n```java\nprivate int getTotalRequests() {\n    return requestsPerIP.values().stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();\n}\n```\n\nOr, alternatively:\n\n```java\nprivate int getTotalRequests() {\n    int total = 0;\n    for (int count : requestsPerIP.values()) {\n        total += count;\n    }\n    return total;\n}\n```\n\nEither way works.\n\nI should also consider performance implications, but for log file sizes that are manageable, this should be fine.\n\nNow, let's think about reading the log file.\n\nUsing `BufferedReader`, I can read the file line by line.\n\nHere's a sketch for the `readLogFile` method:\n\n```java\nprivate void readLogFile(String filePath) {\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            parseLogLine(line);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error reading log file: \" + e.getMessage());\n        System.exit(1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will read the file line by line and parse each line.\n\nI need to make sure that the file path is correct and that the file exists.\n\nFor the main method, I can accept the file path as a command-line argument.\n\nHere's a sketch:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    if (args.length == 0) {\n        System.err.println(\"Please provide the log file path as an argument.\");\n        System.exit(1);\n    }\n\n    String logFilePath = args[0];\n    LogAnalyzer analyzer = new LogAnalyzer();\n    analyzer.readLogFile(logFilePath);\n    analyzer.generateReport();\n}\n```\n\nThis is straightforward.\n\nI should also consider adding more options or parameters in the future, like the number of top URLs to display, but for now, this suffices.\n\nLet me think about how to handle large log files.\n\nIf the log file is very large, loading it all into memory might not be efficient.\n\nIn such cases, processing the file line by line, as I'm doing now, is acceptable because it doesn't require loading the entire file into memory.\n\nHowever, the maps might become large if there are many unique IPs or URLs.\n\nIn such scenarios, I might need to optimize memory usage, but for now, I'll assume that the log files are manageable in size.\n\nAnother consideration is that some logs might be in a different format or have additional fields.\n\nMy current parser is tailored to the CLF format. If the logs are in a different format, the parser will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nFor example, some logs might include the referrer or user agent information, which would require modifying the regex pattern.\n\nBut for this task, I'll assume that all logs are in CLF format.\n\nI should also consider that some logs might have been compressed (e.g., gzip), but handling compressed files would require additional steps, so I'll assume that the log files are plain text.\n\nError handling is important. I need to handle cases where the file doesn't exist, can't be read, or contains lines that don't match the expected format.\n\nI've already added some basic error handling in the `parseLogLine` method by skipping invalid lines and printing error messages.\n\nI should decide whether to skip invalid lines or stop parsing altogether.\n\nGiven that log files can be large and might contain some malformed lines, it's better to skip invalid lines and continue parsing the rest of the file.\n\nNow, let's think about the output report.\n\nI need to generate a summary report that includes:\n\n1. **Number of requests per IP address:**\n\n   - List of IP addresses and their request counts.\n\n   - Maybe sorted by request count in descending order.\n\n2. **Most frequent URLs:**\n\n   - Top N URLs with their request counts.\n\n   - N can be a fixed number, say 10.\n\n3. **Distribution of response codes:**\n\n   - List of status codes and their frequencies.\n\n   - Sorted by status code or by frequency.\n\nI should also include total number of requests, number of unique IP addresses, etc., for completeness.\n\nHere's a rough structure for the report:\n\n```\n\nLog Analysis Report\n\nTotal Requests: XXXX\n\nUnique IPs: XXX\n\nTop 10 Most Frequent URLs:\n\n1. URL1 - Count1\n\n2. URL2 - Count2\n\n...\n\nDistribution of Response Codes:\n\nCode200 - CountA\n\nCode404 - CountB\n\n...\n\nRequests per IP:\n\nIP1 - Count1\n\nIP2 - Count2\n\n...\n\n```\n\nI need to format this output nicely.\n\nIn Java, I can use `System.out.println` to print the report to the console.\n\nAlternatively, I could write the report to a file, but for now, printing to the console is sufficient.\n\nLet me think about sorting the requests per IP.\n\nI can sort the `requestsPerIP` map by values in descending order, similar to the URL frequency.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\n```java\nList<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> ipList = new ArrayList<>(requestsPerIP.entrySet());\nipList.sort(Map.Entry.<String, Integer>comparingByValue().reversed());\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Requests per IP:\");\nfor (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : ipList) {\n    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \" - \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly for the response code distribution.\n\nI should also handle cases where there are no requests or the maps are empty.\n\nI need to add checks to avoid printing empty reports.\n\nNow, let's consider writing a test log file to verify the program.\n\nI can create a sample log file with a few entries and check if the program parses them correctly and generates the expected report.\n\nFor example, a sample log file might look like this:\n\n```\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:34:56 +0000] \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" 200 1024\n\n192.168.1.1 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:35:00 +0000] \"POST /submit_form HTTP/1.1\" 200 512\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:35:05 +0000] \"GET /about.html HTTP/1.1\" 200 768\n\n192.168.1.2 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:35:10 +0000] \"GET /nonexistent_page HTTP/1.1\" 404 256\n\n```\n\nGiven this log file, the program should output a report showing:\n\n- Total requests: 4\n\n- Unique IPs: 3\n\n- Top URLs: /index.html (1), /submit_form (1), /about.html (1), /nonexistent_page (1)\n\n- Since all URLs have the same count, the order might vary.\n\n- Response code distribution: 200 (3), 404 (1)\n\n- Requests per IP: 127.0.0.1 (2), 192.168.1.1 (1), 192.168.1.2 (1)\n\nI need to ensure that the program handles such cases correctly.\n\nI should also test with invalid log lines to ensure that they are skipped properly.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\ninvalid_line\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:34:56 +0000] \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" 200\n\n```\n\nThe first line doesn't match the expected format and should be skipped.\n\nThe second line is missing the bytes field, which might cause parsing issues.\n\nI need to make sure that such lines are handled gracefully without crashing the program.\n\nPerhaps I can modify the regex to make the bytes field optional.\n\nCurrently, my regex requires all fields to be present.\n\nI can adjust the regex to make the last bytes field optional by appending `(\\d+)?` instead of `(\\d+)`.\n\nHowever, in CLF, the bytes field is mandatory, so strictly speaking, logs without it are invalid.\n\nBut to make the parser more robust, I can make it optional.\n\nHere's an adjusted regex:\n\n```\n\n(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}) - - \\[([^\\]]+)\\] \"([^\"]+)\" (\\d{3}) (\\d+)??\n\n```\n\nThe `(\\d+)?` makes the bytes field optional.\n\nThen, in the `parseLogLine` method, I can check if the bytes field is present or not.\n\nBut since I'm not using the bytes field in my statistics, I can ignore it for now.\n\nNow, I need to implement the `generateReport` method to print all the required statistics.\n\nLet me outline the steps for `generateReport`:\n\n1. Print the total number of requests.\n\n2. Print the number of unique IP addresses.\n\n3. Print the top N most frequent URLs.\n\n4. Print the distribution of response codes.\n\n5. Print the requests per IP, sorted by request count.\n\nI need to decide on the formatting of the output.\n\nI can use simple text formatting for now, but if time permits, I can make it more readable.\n\nLet me think about sorting the response code distribution.\n\nIt might be useful to sort it by the status code for easier interpretation.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\n```java\nList<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> codeList = new ArrayList<>(responseCodeDistribution.entrySet());\ncodeList.sort(Map.Entry.comparingByKey());\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Distribution of Response Codes:\");\nfor (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : codeList) {\n    System.out.println(\"Code \" + entry.getKey() + \" - \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n```\n\nThis will sort the response codes in ascending order.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort by frequency if needed.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing the `LogAnalyzer` class.\n\nI need to define the class with the required maps and methods.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class LogAnalyzer {\n\n    private Map<String, Integer> requestsPerIP;\n    private Map<String, Integer> urlFrequency;\n    private Map<Integer, Integer> responseCodeDistribution;\n\n    public LogAnalyzer() {\n        requestsPerIP = new HashMap<>();\n        urlFrequency = new HashMap<>();\n        responseCodeDistribution = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void readLogFile(String filePath) {\n        // Implementation as sketched earlier\n    }\n\n    private void parseLogLine(String line) {\n        // Implementation as sketched earlier\n    }\n\n    private void updateStatistics(String ip, String method, String url, int statusCode) {\n        // Implementation as sketched earlier\n    }\n\n    public void generateReport() {\n        // Implementation as sketched earlier\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Implementation as sketched earlier\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis outlines the structure of the class.\n\nI need to fill in the methods with the actual code.\n\nI should also consider adding comments and javadocs for better readability and maintenance.\n\nNow, I need to think about testing the program.\n\nSince I can't run the program here, I'll outline the testing steps:\n\n1. Create a sample log file with known contents.\n\n2. Run the program with the sample log file.\n\n3. Verify that the output report matches the expected statistics.\n\n4. Test with invalid log lines to ensure they are handled correctly.\n\n5. Test with a large log file to check performance.\n\nGiven that, I should also consider adding unit tests for the parsing and statistics functions, but that might be beyond the scope of this task.\n\nNow, let's think about potential improvements or extensions:\n\n- Support for different log formats, not just CLF.\n\n- Option to output the report to a file instead of the console.\n\n- More detailed statistics, such as average requests per IP, most active times, etc.\n\n- Handling compressed log files.\n\n- Multithreading for processing large log files more quickly.\n\nBut for this basic version, I'll keep it simple and focus on the core requirements.\n\nI should also consider security aspects, such as ensuring that the program doesn't expose sensitive information from the log files.\n\nSince the program only processes the log files and prints summary statistics, and assuming that the log files don't contain sensitive data, this should be fine.\n\nHowever, in a real-world scenario, I need to be cautious about handling log data that might contain personal information.\n\nNow, I need to write the actual code for the `LogAnalyzer` class.\n\nI'll proceed to implement each method step by step.\n\nFirst, the constructor:\n\n```java\npublic LogAnalyzer() {\n    requestsPerIP = new HashMap<>();\n    urlFrequency = new HashMap<>();\n    responseCodeDistribution = new HashMap<>();\n}\n```\n\nNext, the `readLogFile` method:\n\n```java\npublic void readLogFile(String filePath) {\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            parseLogLine(line);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error reading log file: \" + e.getMessage());\n        System.exit(1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen, the `parseLogLine` method:\n\n```java\nprivate void parseLogLine(String line) {\n    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\n        \"(\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}) - - \\\\[([^\\]]+)\\\\] \\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\" (\\\\d{3}) (\\\\d+)\"\n    );\n\n    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(line);\n\n    if (matcher.matches()) {\n        String ip = matcher.group(1);\n        String dateTime = matcher.group(2);\n        String request = matcher.group(3);\n        String statusCodeStr = matcher.group(4);\n        // String bytesStr = matcher.group(5); // Not used in current statistics\n\n        // Further parse the request string\n        String[] requestParts = request.split(\" \");\n        if (requestParts.length == 3) {\n            String method = requestParts[0];\n            String url = requestParts[1];\n            String protocol = requestParts[2];\n\n            // Convert status code to integer\n            int statusCode = Integer.parseInt(statusCodeStr);\n\n            // Now, call updateStatistics with these values\n            updateStatistics(ip, method, url, statusCode);\n        } else {\n            // Invalid request format, skip this line\n            System.err.println(\"Invalid request format: \" + request);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Line doesn't match the expected format, skip\n        System.err.println(\"Skipping invalid log line: \" + line);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, the `updateStatistics` method:\n\n```java\nprivate void updateStatistics(String ip, String method, String url, int statusCode) {\n    // Update requests per IP\n    requestsPerIP.put(ip, requestsPerIP.getOrDefault(ip, 0) + 1);\n\n    // Update URL frequency\n    urlFrequency.put(url, urlFrequency.getOrDefault(url, 0) + 1);\n\n    // Update response code distribution\n    responseCodeDistribution.put(statusCode, responseCodeDistribution.getOrDefault(statusCode, 0) + 1);\n}\n```\n\nNow, the `generateReport` method:\n\n```java\npublic void generateReport() {\n    // Calculate total requests\n    int totalRequests = requestsPerIP.values().stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();\n\n    // Print total requests\n    System.out.println(\"Total Requests: \" + totalRequests);\n\n    // Print unique IPs\n    System.out.println(\"Unique IPs: \" + requestsPerIP.size());\n\n    // Print top 10 most frequent URLs\n    List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> urlList = new ArrayList<>(urlFrequency.entrySet());\n    urlList.sort(Map.Entry.<String, Integer>comparingByValue().reversed());\n\n    System.out.println(\"\\nTop 10 Most Frequent URLs:\");\n    int count = 0;\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : urlList) {\n        if (count >= 10) break;\n        System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \" - \" + entry.getValue());\n        count++;\n    }\n\n    // Print distribution of response codes, sorted by code\n    List<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> codeList = new ArrayList<>(responseCodeDistribution.entrySet());\n    codeList.sort(Map.Entry.comparingByKey());\n\n    System.out.println(\"\\nDistribution of Response Codes:\");\n    for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : codeList) {\n        System.out.println(\"Code \" + entry.getKey() + \" - \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n\n    // Print requests per IP, sorted by request count descending\n    List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> ipList = new ArrayList<>(requestsPerIP.entrySet());\n    ipList.sort(Map.Entry.<String, Integer>comparingByValue().reversed());\n\n    System.out.println(\"\\nRequests per IP:\");\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : ipList) {\n        System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \" - \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the `main` method:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    if (args.length == 0) {\n        System.err.println(\"Please provide the log file path as an argument.\");\n        System.exit(1);\n    }\n\n    String logFilePath = args[0];\n    LogAnalyzer analyzer = new LogAnalyzer();\n    analyzer.readLogFile(logFilePath);\n    analyzer.generateReport();\n}\n```\n\nThis completes the basic implementation of the log analyzer program.\n\nI should test this program with a sample log file to ensure it works as expected.\n\nAssuming I have a file named `access_log` with the following content:\n\n```\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:34:56 +0000] \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" 200 1024\n\n192.168.1.1 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:35:00 +0000] \"POST /submit_form HTTP/1.1\" 200 512\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:35:05 +0000] \"GET /about.html HTTP/1.1\" 200 768\n\n192.168.1.2 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:35:10 +0000] \"GET /nonexistent_page HTTP/1.1\" 404 256\n\n```\n\nRunning the program with `java LogAnalyzer access_log` should produce a report similar to:\n\n```\n\nTotal Requests: 4\n\nUnique IPs: 3\n\nTop 10 Most Frequent URLs:\n\n/index.html - 1\n\n/submit_form - 1\n\n/about.html - 1\n\n/nonexistent_page - 1\n\nDistribution of Response Codes:\n\nCode 200 - 3\n\nCode 404 - 1\n\nRequests per IP:\n\n127.0.0.1 - 2\n\n192.168.1.1 - 1\n\n192.168.1.2 - 1\n\n```\n\nThis seems correct based on the sample log file.\n\nI should also test with invalid lines to ensure they are skipped.\n\nFor example, adding lines like:\n\n```\n\ninvalid_line\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2023:12:34:56 +0000] \"GET /missing_bytes HTTP/1.1\" 200\n\n```\n\nThe program should skip these lines and continue parsing the valid ones.\n\nIn summary, this Java program reads a web server log file, parses each log entry to extract IP address, request method, URL, and response code, and then generates a summary report including total requests, unique IPs, top frequent URLs, response code distribution, and requests per IP.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java program that analyzes web server log files, follow these steps to parse the log files, extract relevant information, and generate a summary report.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading the Log File:** Use `BufferedReader` to read the log file line by line.\n2. **Parsing Each Line:** Use regular expressions to extract IP address, request method, URL, and response code from each log entry.\n3. **Storing Extracted Data:** Use `HashMap`s to store and count requests per IP, frequency of URLs, and distribution of response codes.\n4. **Generating Summary Statistics:** Sort and compile the statistics from the maps.\n5. **Output the Report:** Print the summary report to the console.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.util.regex.*;\n\npublic class LogAnalyzer {\n\n    private Map<String, Integer> requestsPerIP;\n    private Map<String, Integer> urlFrequency;\n    private Map<Integer, Integer> responseCodeDistribution;\n\n    public LogAnalyzer() {\n        requestsPerIP = new HashMap<>();\n        urlFrequency = new HashMap<>();\n        responseCodeDistribution = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void readLogFile(String filePath) {\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                parseLogLine(line);\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error reading log file: \" + e.getMessage());\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void parseLogLine(String line) {\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\n            \"(\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.\\\\d{1,3}) -
