        "content": "Spring weather in London and Tokyo can vary due to differences in geography and climate patterns. London has a temperate oceanic climate, which means that spring months (March to May) are mild with temperatures ranging from around 6\u00b0C (43\u00b0F) to 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F). It's common to experience rainy days during this time, as rainfall is spread throughout the year.\n\nOn the other hand, Tokyo has a humid subtropical climate. Spring in Tokyo, from March to May, is generally mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from about 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) to 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F). One notable feature of spring in Tokyo is the cherry blossom season, which typically occurs in late March to early April, attracting many visitors.\n\nIn summary, both cities experience mild springs, but Tokyo tends to be warmer and has a more distinct seasonal event with the cherry blossoms."
