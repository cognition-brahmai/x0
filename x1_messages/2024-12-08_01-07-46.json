However, in general, emergency rooms prioritize patients based on the severity of their condition, not on how they arrived at the hospital. This system is known as triage. So, whether you arrive in a police car or your own vehicle, the medical staff will assess your condition and treat you accordingly. It's important to remember that emergency services are there for everyone who needs them, and they strive to provide care based on medical need."
