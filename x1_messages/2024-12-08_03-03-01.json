        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a telecom company that wants to boost its network coverage by 20% over the next two years by adding more cell towers. They currently have 5,000 towers, each covering 10 square miles, and each new tower costs $150,000 to install, plus $10,000 per year in maintenance.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what their current coverage area is. If they have 5,000 towers and each covers 10 square miles, then their total coverage now is:\n\n5,000 towers * 10 sq miles/tower = 50,000 sq miles\n\nThey want to increase this by 20%. So, the additional coverage needed is:\n\n20% of 50,000 sq miles = 0.20 * 50,000 = 10,000 sq miles\n\nNow, each new tower covers 10 sq miles, so the number of additional towers required would be:\n\n10,000 sq miles / 10 sq miles/tower = 1,000 towers\n\nThat seems straightforward. So, they need to add 1,000 more towers to achieve the 20% increase in coverage.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of this project. Each new tower costs $150,000 to install. So, for 1,000 towers, the installation cost would be:\n\n1,000 towers * $150,000/tower = $150,000,000\n\nAdditionally, there's an annual maintenance cost of $10,000 per tower. Since the goal is to cover this over two years, the maintenance cost over that period would be:\n\n1,000 towers * $10,000/tower/year * 2 years = $20,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total cost for the project would be the installation cost plus the maintenance cost over two years:\n\n$150,000,000 + $20,000,000 = $170,000,000\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider whether the maintenance cost is included in the project cost or if it's an ongoing expense. The question says \"estimated cost of this project,\" and it includes annual maintenance cost of $10,000 per tower. If the project cost is meant to cover only the initial outlay, then perhaps the maintenance should be considered separately.\n\nLet me check the question again: \"Calculate the number of additional cell towers required and the estimated cost of this project, considering each cell tower costs $150,000 to install and has an annual maintenance cost of $10,000.\"\n\nIt seems like the maintenance cost is part of the project cost, at least according to the way it's phrased. So, including the two years of maintenance, the total cost would be $170 million.\n\nAlternatively, if the maintenance is considered an ongoing expense beyond the project cost, then perhaps only the installation cost should be included in the project cost. But since the question specifies to consider the annual maintenance cost, I think including it in the project cost is appropriate.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Additional towers needed: 1,000\n\n- Installation cost: $150 million\n\n- Maintenance cost for 2 years: $20 million\n\n- Total project cost: $170 million\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for. But in reality, projects like this might have other costs involved, such as land acquisition, permits, labor for installation, and so on. Also, the maintenance might be handled differently, perhaps spread out over the useful life of the towers. But based on the information provided, $170 million seems to be the estimated cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000 \\text{ towers, } \\$170,000,000} \\]"
