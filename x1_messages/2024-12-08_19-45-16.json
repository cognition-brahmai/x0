        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a man who buys and sells a horse multiple times, and we need to figure out his overall profit. Here's the sequence of transactions:\n\n1. Buys a horse for $60.\n\n2. Sells it for $70.\n\n3. Buys it back for $80.\n\n4. Sells it again for $90.\n\nNow, the question is, how much profit did he make in total? Profit is generally calculated as the difference between selling price and buying price, but since there are multiple transactions, we need to be careful about how we calculate it.\n\nLet's consider different approaches to solve this problem.\n\n**Solution 1: Calculate profit for each transaction separately and then sum them up.**\n\nIn the first transaction, he buys the horse for $60. Since this is a purchase, it's an expense, so we can consider this as a negative amount: -$60.\n\nThen, he sells it for $70, which is income: +$70.\n\nSo, the profit from the first buy and sell is: -$60 + $70 = $10.\n\nNext, he buys it back for $80: -$80.\n\nThen, he sells it again for $90: +$90.\n\nProfit from the second buy and sell is: -$80 + $90 = $10.\n\nTotal profit would be the sum of profits from both sequences: $10 + $10 = $20.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but let's check if there are other ways to look at it.\n\n**Solution 2: Consider the horse's ownership and calculate overall profit.**\n\nAnother way is to think about the horse's value and the man's net gain.\n\nInitially, he buys the horse for $60, so his net worth decreases by $60.\n\nThen, he sells it for $70, so his net worth increases by $70 - $60 = $10.\n\nNow, he buys it back for $80, which means he spends an additional $80, so his net worth decreases by $80 - $70 = $10.\n\nFinally, he sells it again for $90, so his net worth increases by $90 - $80 = $10.\n\nOverall, his net worth has increased by $10 (from first buy and sell) - $10 (from buying back) + $10 (from second sell) = $10.\n\nWait, that gives a total profit of $10, which is different from the first solution's $20. Hmm, interesting. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet's see what's going on.\n\nIn the first approach, we looked at each buy and sell pair separately and added their profits. In the second approach, we tracked the net worth change step by step.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nLet's recast it.\n\nStarting with zero.\n\n1. Buys for $60: net worth decreases by $60 \u2192 net worth = -$60.\n\n2. Sells for $70: net worth increases by $70 \u2192 net worth = -$60 + $70 = $10.\n\n3. Buys back for $80: net worth decreases by $80 \u2192 net worth = $10 - $80 = -$70.\n\n4. Sells again for $90: net worth increases by $90 \u2192 net worth = -$70 + $90 = $20.\n\nSo, final net worth is $20, meaning a total profit of $20.\n\nAh, in the second approach, I mistakenly calculated the net worth changes incorrectly earlier. Now, it matches the first approach's total profit of $20.\n\n**Solution 3: Consider the horse's cost and selling prices cumulatively.**\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider all buying transactions as total expenses and all selling transactions as total income.\n\nTotal buying: $60 (first buy) + $80 (second buy) = $140.\n\nTotal selling: $70 (first sell) + $90 (second sell) = $160.\n\nProfit = total selling - total buying = $160 - $140 = $20.\n\nThis again confirms the earlier result.\n\n**Solution 4: Think about the horse's resales and repurchases.**\n\nSometimes, people get confused about owning the horse multiple times. Let's see.\n\nHe first buys for $60 and sells for $70: profit of $10.\n\nThen, he buys back for $80, which is like investing another $10 on top of the initial $70 he got from selling.\n\nFinally, he sells it for $90, which is $10 more than the $80 he paid to buy it back.\n\nSo, the total profit is $10 (from first sell) + $10 (from second sell) = $20.\n\nThis aligns with the previous solutions.\n\n**Solution 5: Consider the horse's value at each transaction.**\n\nSome might think about the horse's value changing over time, but in this problem, we're only concerned with the transactions' impact on the man's profit, not the horse's market value.\n\nSo, focusing on the transactions is key.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter considering multiple approaches, all consistent in concluding that the man made a total profit of $20.\n\n- Solution 1: Sum of profits from each buy-sell pair: $10 + $10 = $20.\n\n- Solution 2: Tracking net worth step by step: final net worth increase of $20.\n\n- Solution 3: Total selling minus total buying: $160 - $140 = $20.\n\n- Solution 4: Cumulative profit from each sale: $10 + $10 = $20.\n\n- Solution 5: Focusing on transactions rather than the horse's value: aligns with $20 profit.\n\nTherefore, the best and most accurate answer is that the man made a profit of $20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
