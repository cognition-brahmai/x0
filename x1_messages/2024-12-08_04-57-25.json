        "content": "The hour and minute hands of a clock overlap multiple times in a 12-hour period. To determine how many times they overlap in 24 hours, we need to understand the mechanics of a clock.\n\nFirst, let's consider a 12-hour period. The minute hand completes one full revolution every 60 minutes, while the hour hand completes one full revolution every 12 hours (720 minutes). This means the minute hand moves 12 times faster than the hour hand.\n\nThe formula to find the number of overlaps in a 12-hour period is:\n\nNumber of overlaps = 11\n\nThis is because the minute hand gains 11 minutes every 60 minutes on the hour hand. Therefore, in 12 hours, the minute hand will overlap the hour hand 11 times.\n\nNow, for a 24-hour period, we simply double the number of overlaps in 12 hours:\n\nNumber of overlaps in 24 hours = 11 * 2 = 22\n\nTherefore, the hour and minute hands of a clock will overlap 22 times in 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
