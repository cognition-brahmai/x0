        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from City A to City B, which is 120 miles apart, at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. But halfway, which would be at 60 miles, it stops for 30 minutes because of a technical issue. I need to find the average speed for the entire journey.\n\nFirst, I should recall that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, the total distance is 120 miles. Now, I need to find the total time taken for the journey.\n\nThe train travels at 60 miles per hour, so without any stops, the time to travel 120 miles would be distance divided by speed, which is 120 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, so that's 2 hours.\n\nBut there's a stop halfway for 30 minutes. So, I need to add that stop time to the total time.\n\nWait, but let's make sure about the stop. It says \"halfway between City A and City B,\" which is 60 miles from each city. So, the train travels 60 miles at 60 miles per hour, which takes 1 hour, then stops for 30 minutes, and then continues the remaining 60 miles at 60 miles per hour, which takes another 1 hour.\n\nSo, total time is 1 hour (first half) + 0.5 hours (stop) + 1 hour (second half) = 2.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 120 miles divided by 2.5 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that: 120 divided by 2.5 is the same as 120 divided by 5/2, which is 120 multiplied by 2/5, which is (120 * 2) / 5 = 240 / 5 = 48 miles per hour.\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire journey is 48 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the average speed using the formula for average speed when there are different speeds and distances.\n\nBut in this case, the speed is constant at 60 mph except for the stop. The stop is a speed of 0 for 30 minutes.\n\nSo, perhaps I can consider the stop as a part of the journey where speed is 0.\n\nSo, total time is still 2.5 hours for 120 miles, so 120 / 2.5 = 48 mph.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the harmonic mean, but I don't think that's necessary here because the speeds are constant except for the stop.\n\nNo, I think the straightforward approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the average speed is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
