This historic event took place during NASA's Apollo 11 mission, where astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, while Michael Collins orbited above in the Command Module. This achievement was a significant milestone in space exploration and marked the culmination of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union."
