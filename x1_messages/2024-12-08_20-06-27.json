        "content": "Okay, so there are 120 students in total at the school, and 45% of them are girls. I need to find out how many boys there are. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many girls there are, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to get the number of boys.\n\nSo, 45% of 120 students are girls. To find out how many that is, I can calculate 45% of 120.\n\nI know that \"percent\" means \"per hundred\", so 45% is the same as 45/100 or 0.45.\n\nSo, the number of girls is 0.45 times 120.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 0.45 \u00d7 120.\n\nWell, 0.45 \u00d7 100 is 45, and 0.45 \u00d7 20 is 9, so adding those together, 45 + 9 equals 54.\n\nSo, there are 54 girls in the school.\n\nNow, to find the number of boys, I subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:\n\n120 - 54 = 66.\n\nTherefore, there are 66 boys in the school.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over: total students are 120, 45% are girls.\n\nSo, percentage of boys would be 100% - 45% = 55%.\n\nSo, alternatively, I could calculate 55% of 120 to find the number of boys directly.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n55% is 0.55 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 0.55 \u00d7 120.\n\n0.50 \u00d7 120 is 60, and 0.05 \u00d7 120 is 6, so 60 + 6 equals 66.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, there are indeed 66 boys in the school.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula:\n\nNumber of boys = total students - number of girls.\n\nI already calculated the number of girls as 54, so 120 - 54 equals 66.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 66 boys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
