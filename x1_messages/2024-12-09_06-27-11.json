The expression is (6^2 / 3) * 4 - 8 + 10.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate 6 raised to the power of 2. 6^2 is 36.\n\nSo now the expression is (36 / 3) * 4 - 8 + 10.\n\nNext, I divide 36 by 3, which is 12.\n\nNow it's 12 * 4 - 8 + 10.\n\nThen, I multiply 12 by 4, which gives 48.\n\nSo now it's 48 - 8 + 10.\n\nThen, subtract 8 from 48, which is 40.\n\nFinally, add 10 to 40, which equals 50.\n\nSo the final answer is 50."
