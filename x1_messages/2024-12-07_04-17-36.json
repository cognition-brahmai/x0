        "content": "So I've got this problem here: the population of a city doubles every 40 years, and right now there are 50,000 people. I need to figure out what the population will be after 120 years. Hmm, doubling every 40 years, that sounds like exponential growth, right? I think I should use the formula for exponential growth to solve this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for exponential growth. I think it's something like P = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where P is the future population, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is time. But wait, in this case, the population doubles every 40 years, so maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the population doubles every 40 years, then in 40 years, it goes from 50,000 to 100,000. Then, in another 40 years (so 80 years total), it would double again to 200,000. And again, in another 40 years (120 years total), it would double to 400,000. Wait, but that seems straightforward. So, after 120 years, the population would be 400,000.\n\nBut let me check if that's accurate. 120 years is three periods of 40 years each, and each time the population doubles. So, starting with 50,000:\n\n- After 40 years: 50,000 * 2 = 100,000\n\n- After 80 years: 100,000 * 2 = 200,000\n\n- After 120 years: 200,000 * 2 = 400,000\n\nThat makes sense. But maybe there's a formula I can use to calculate this more generally, in case the time period isn't a perfect multiple of the doubling time.\n\nI recall there's a formula for exponential growth where P = P0 * 2^(t/T), where T is the doubling time. In this case, T is 40 years, t is 120 years, P0 is 50,000.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP = 50,000 * 2^(120/40)\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent: 120 divided by 40 is 3.\n\nSo, P = 50,000 * 2^3\n\n2^3 is 8.\n\nTherefore, P = 50,000 * 8 = 400,000\n\nOkay, that matches what I calculated earlier by doubling step by step. So, it looks like 400,000 is the correct population after 120 years.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the population growth, like migration or changes in the doubling rate. The problem doesn't mention any such factors, so I think it's safe to assume that the population doubles every 40 years without any modifications.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The time period is in years, and the doubling time is also in years, so that's good.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to use the formula for exponential growth with a constant growth rate. The general formula is P = P0 * e^(rt), where r is the continuous growth rate, t is time, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with doubling every 40 years, it's easier to use the formula I used earlier: P = P0 * 2^(t/T).\n\nSo, sticking with P = 50,000 * 2^(120/40) = 50,000 * 8 = 400,000.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to be absolutely sure, let's try calculating it again.\n\nStarting population: 50,000\n\nAfter 40 years: 50,000 * 2 = 100,000\n\nAfter 80 years: 100,000 * 2 = 200,000\n\nAfter 120 years: 200,000 * 2 = 400,000\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: P = P0 * 2^(t/T) = 50,000 * 2^(120/40) = 50,000 * 2^3 = 50,000 * 8 = 400,000.\n\nIt's consistent across both methods.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The problem is straightforward, and the answer seems clear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400000} \\]"
