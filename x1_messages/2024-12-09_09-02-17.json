        "content": "Let's see. So, the company produces widgets at a cost of $5 each and sells them for $12 each. They want to make a profit of $2,100. I need to figure out how many widgets they need to sell to reach that profit.\n\nFirst, I should understand what profit means. Profit is the amount of money left after subtracting the costs from the revenue. So, profit equals revenue minus cost.\n\nIn this case, the revenue is the money earned from selling the widgets, which is the selling price per widget multiplied by the number of widgets sold. The cost is the production cost per widget multiplied by the number of widgets produced.\n\nLet me denote the number of widgets sold as \\( x \\).\n\nSo, revenue \\( R \\) is \\( 12x \\) (since each widget is sold for $12).\n\nCost \\( C \\) is \\( 5x \\) (since each widget costs $5 to produce).\n\nTherefore, profit \\( P \\) is \\( R - C = 12x - 5x = 7x \\).\n\nThey want the profit to be $2,100, so I can set up the equation:\n\n\\( 7x = 2,100 \\).\n\nNow, I just need to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = \\frac{2,100}{7} \\).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\( 2,100 \\div 7 = 300 \\).\n\nSo, they need to sell 300 widgets to make a profit of $2,100.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other costs involved, like fixed costs, but the problem doesn't mention any fixed costs, so I assume that the only cost is the production cost per widget.\n\nAlso, it's assumed that all produced widgets are sold, so the number of widgets produced equals the number sold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 300 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
