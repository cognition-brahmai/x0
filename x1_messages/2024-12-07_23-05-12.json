        "content": "The primary role of bees in the pollination process is to transport pollen between flowers, facilitating cross-pollination. So, the correct answer is B. Bees play a crucial role in pollination because as they move from flower to flower collecting nectar, they inadvertently transfer pollen from the anthers (where pollen is produced) to the stigmas (where pollen needs to be deposited for fertilization) of different flowers. This cross-pollination helps in the reproduction of many plant species, including those that provide food for humans and other animals."
