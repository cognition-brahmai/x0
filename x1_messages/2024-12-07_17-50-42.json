        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 6 black socks and 8 white socks in a box, making a total of 14 socks. I need to find the probability that if I pick out 3 socks randomly, I get at least one matching pair. That means, among the 3 socks, at least two should be of the same color.\n\nFirst, I should understand what constitutes a matching pair. It means two socks of the same color. So, in the selection of 3 socks, it's possible to have:\n\n1. Two black and one white sock.\n\n2. Two white and one black sock.\n\n3. All three socks being black.\n\n4. All three socks being white.\n\nAny of these scenarios would give me at least one matching pair.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the case where all three socks are the same color, that still counts as having at least one matching pair. So, all of these are favorable outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, the only way I wouldn't have a matching pair is if all three socks are of different colors. But since there are only two colors, that's impossible. Wait, that's a useful realization.\n\nWait a minute, there are only two colors, so it's impossible to pick three socks without at least two being the same color. Because if the first two are different, the third one has to match one of them.\n\nSo, in this case, is the probability 100% that I get at least one matching pair?\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me calculate it properly.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to pick 3 socks out of 14.\n\nThat's the combination of 14 socks taken 3 at a time, which is 14 choose 3.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(14, 3) = 14! / (3! * 11!) = (14 * 13 * 12) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 364.\n\nSo, there are 364 possible ways to pick 3 socks from 14.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to pick 3 socks such that at least two are of the same color.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, since there are only two colors, every selection of 3 socks will have at least two socks of the same color.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is equal to the total number of possible outcomes, which is 364.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 364/364 = 1, or 100%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this logic.\n\nSuppose I pick one black and one white sock first, and then another sock. The third sock will have to be either black or white, thus making a pair.\n\nAlternatively, if I pick two blacks first, the third will be either black or white, still making a pair.\n\nSimilarly, if I pick two whites first, the third will make at least one pair.\n\nSo, in all possible scenarios, I will have at least one pair of the same color.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 100%.\n\nBut, maybe I should look at it from another angle.\n\nSuppose I try to calculate the probability of not having a matching pair, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of having at least one matching pair.\n\nSo, the probability of not having a matching pair would be the probability of picking three socks where no two are the same color.\n\nBut, given that there are only two colors, this is impossible because if you pick two different colors for the first two socks, the third sock has to be one of those two colors, thus forming a pair.\n\nWait, no, actually, if you have only two colors, and you pick three socks, it's impossible to have all three socks be of different colors because there are only two colors.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not having a matching pair is zero.\n\nHence, the probability of having at least one matching pair is 1 - 0 = 1, or 100%.\n\nSo, my initial conclusion stands.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1, or 100%.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider the possible distributions:\n\n- Two black and one white: C(6, 2) * C(8, 1)\n\n- Two white and one black: C(8, 2) * C(6, 1)\n\n- Three black: C(6, 3)\n\n- Three white: C(8, 3)\n\nLet's calculate each:\n\nC(6, 2) = 15\n\nC(8, 1) = 8\n\nSo, two black and one white: 15 * 8 = 120\n\nC(8, 2) = 28\n\nC(6, 1) = 6\n\nSo, two white and one black: 28 * 6 = 168\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nTherefore, total favorable outcomes:\n\n120 + 168 + 20 + 56 = 364\n\nWhich matches the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 364/364 = 1.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
