        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from City A to City B and then to City C. It takes 3 hours to go from A to B, which is 180 miles apart, and then another 2 hours to go from B to C, which is 120 miles apart. I need to find the average speed for the entire journey.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed is. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, I should find the total distance and the total time separately and then divide one by the other.\n\nThe total distance is the sum of the distances from A to B and B to C. That's 180 miles plus 120 miles, which equals 300 miles.\n\nNow, the total time is the time from A to B plus the time from B to C. That's 3 hours plus 2 hours, which equals 5 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed should be the total distance divided by the total time, which is 300 miles divided by 5 hours. That equals 60 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the train goes 180 miles in 3 hours, that's 60 miles per hour, and then 120 miles in 2 hours, which is also 60 miles per hour. So, overall, the average speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\nBut, I should consider if the train was moving at a constant speed or if it changed speeds. The problem doesn't specify that, so I'm assuming the speed varied or was constant, but since it's not specified, I can proceed with the average speed calculation as I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's another way to calculate it, like using the harmonic mean or something, but I think for average speed, total distance over total time is the correct approach.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the train was moving at different speeds for different parts of the journey, the average speed would still be the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nBut in this case, coincidentally, the speed for both parts is the same, 60 mph, so the average is also 60 mph.\n\nWait, but what if the speeds were different? For example, if from A to B it was 60 mph and from B to C it was 60 mph, then average is indeed 60 mph.\n\nBut to confirm, let's assume different speeds. Suppose from A to B, 180 miles in 3 hours, 60 mph, and from B to C, 120 miles in 2 hours, 60 mph. Total distance 300 miles in 5 hours, average 60 mph.\n\nIf the speeds were different, say from A to B 180 miles in 3 hours, 60 mph, and from B to C 120 miles in 2 hours, 60 mph, it still averages to 60 mph.\n\nWait, but if from B to C, it was a different speed, say 120 miles in 2 hours, still 60 mph. So in this case, it remains 60 mph.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. The straightforward approach is correct: total distance divided by total time.\n\nSo, the average speed is 300 miles divided by 5 hours, which is 60 miles per hour.\n\nI can also check if there's another way to look at it. Maybe calculate the weighted average of the speeds, weighted by time.\n\nFrom A to B: 60 mph for 3 hours\n\nFrom B to C: 60 mph for 2 hours\n\nSo, the weighted average would be (60 mph * 3 hours + 60 mph * 2 hours) divided by total time, which is 5 hours. That's (180 + 120) / 5 = 300 / 5 = 60 mph.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if the speeds were different, say from A to B 60 mph and from B to C 60 mph, the average would still be 60 mph.\n\nI think I'm convinced that the average speed is 60 miles per hour for the entire journey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
