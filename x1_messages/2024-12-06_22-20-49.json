        "content": "So I have this problem here: A company has 8 employees, and they need to form a committee of 3 people. How many different committees can be formed? Hmm, this seems like a combination problem, right? Because the order in which we select the committee members doesn't matter; it's just about who is chosen, not who comes first.\n\nSo, I recall that the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 8 and k = 3.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers: C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8 - 3)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / ((3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)(5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)).\n\nWait, this looks a bit messy. Maybe there's a simpler way to calculate this. I remember that factorials can be simplified when you expand them.\n\nSo, 8! is 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, and 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. So, in the denominator, we have 3! \u00d7 5!, which is (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)(5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nNow, if I look at the numerator, 8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!, so the 5! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! \u00d7 5!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (3! \u00d7 5!)) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / 3!.\n\nNow, 3! is 6, so it's (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / 6.\n\nThe 6 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so it's just 8 \u00d7 7 = 56.\n\nWait a minute, but I think I've seen this problem before, and I think the answer is 56. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step. For the first position on the committee, there are 8 possible employees to choose from. Once I've chosen the first one, there are 7 remaining employees to choose from for the second position. Then, for the third position, there are 6 employees left.\n\nSo, that would be 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 = 336 possible ways to choose the committee if order matters. But since order doesn't matter, I need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 people, which is 3! = 6.\n\nSo, 336 / 6 = 56. Again, I get 56.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the combination formula directly. The number of ways to choose 3 people out of 8 is C(8, 3) = 56.\n\nI also know that the combination formula can be symmetric, meaning C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). So, C(8, 3) should be equal to C(8, 5), because choosing 3 people to be on the committee is the same as choosing 5 people to not be on the committee.\n\nLet me check: C(8, 5) = 8! / (5! \u00d7 3!) = same as C(8, 3), which is 56.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the number of different committees that can be formed is 56.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]"
