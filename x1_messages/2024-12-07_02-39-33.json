        "content": "Let's see. So, the city rains on average 10 days per month, and each rainy day has about 0.2 inches of rainfall. I need to find out how many inches of rain the city gets in a whole year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many rainy days there are in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year and it rains 10 days each month, I can multiply 10 days by 12 months. That should give me the total number of rainy days in a year.\n\nSo, 10 days/month * 12 months = 120 days/year.\n\nNow, each of those rainy days has 0.2 inches of rainfall. To find the total rainfall in a year, I need to multiply the number of rainy days by the average rainfall per day.\n\nSo, 120 days/year * 0.2 inches/day = 24 inches/year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 10 days per month times 12 months is indeed 120 days per year.\n\nThen, 120 days times 0.2 inches per day is 24 inches.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in months. Each month has 10 rainy days with 0.2 inches each, so per month, the rainfall is 10 * 0.2 = 2 inches.\n\nThen, over 12 months, it would be 2 inches/month * 12 months = 24 inches/year.\n\nSame answer.\n\nOr, I could consider that on average, every day has some amount of rain, but since it only rains 10 days a month, it's better to stick with the given information.\n\nSo, the city receives 24 inches of rain in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
