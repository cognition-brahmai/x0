        "content": "So, the doctor gives you three pills and instructs you to take one every half hour. The question is, how long will it take before all the pills have been taken?\n\nLet me think about this step by step. You have three pills to take, and each one is to be taken every half hour. So, you take the first pill at time zero, let's say time t=0.\n\nThen, you wait half an hour to take the second pill. So, the second pill is taken at t=30 minutes.\n\nAfter another half hour, you take the third pill, which would be at t=60 minutes.\n\nSo, from the time you take the first pill to the time you take the last pill is one hour.\n\nBut, the question is, how long will it take before all the pills have been taken? Well, all pills are taken by the time you take the last one, which is at 60 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe considering the time between the first and the last pill.\n\nLet me see. If you take the first pill at time zero, and the last one at 60 minutes, the duration between the first and the last pill is one hour.\n\nBut, the question is a bit tricky because it's asking for the time before all pills have been taken. So, once you take the third pill at 60 minutes, all pills have been taken.\n\nTherefore, it takes 60 minutes before all the pills have been taken.\n\nAlternatively, some might think that since you're taking a pill every half hour, it's 30 minutes times three pills, which would be 90 minutes. But that's not correct because the first pill is at time zero.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 60 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
