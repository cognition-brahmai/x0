        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces 500 units of a product in 8 hours with 20 workers. Now, we need to find out how many additional workers are required to produce 750 units in the same amount of time, which is 8 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the production output. It seems like the number of workers is directly proportional to the production output, assuming that each worker contributes equally to the production.\n\nSo, if 20 workers can produce 500 units in 8 hours, then one worker would produce fewer units, and more workers would produce more units in the same time frame.\n\nLet me calculate the production rate per worker per hour to get a better understanding.\n\nFirst, find the total production per worker in 8 hours:\n\n500 units / 20 workers = 25 units per worker in 8 hours.\n\nNow, to find the production rate per worker per hour:\n\n25 units / 8 hours = 3.125 units per hour per worker.\n\nAlright, so each worker produces 3.125 units per hour.\n\nNow, we need to produce 750 units in 8 hours. Let's find out the total production required per hour:\n\n750 units / 8 hours = 93.75 units per hour.\n\nNow, if each worker produces 3.125 units per hour, then the number of workers needed to produce 93.75 units per hour is:\n\n93.75 units per hour / 3.125 units per hour per worker = 30 workers.\n\nSo, to produce 750 units in 8 hours, we need 30 workers.\n\nBut wait, we already have 20 workers. So, the additional workers needed would be:\n\n30 workers - 20 workers = 10 workers.\n\nTherefore, 10 additional workers are needed to produce 750 units in 8 hours.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n20 workers produce 500 units in 8 hours.\n\nSo, production rate per worker per hour is 500 / (20 * 8) = 500 / 160 = 3.125 units per hour per worker.\n\nRequired production is 750 units in 8 hours.\n\nTotal production required per hour is 750 / 8 = 93.75 units per hour.\n\nNumber of workers needed = 93.75 / 3.125 = 30 workers.\n\nAdditional workers needed = 30 - 20 = 10 workers.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 20 workers can produce 500 units in 8 hours, then to produce 750 units in the same time, we can set up a proportion based on the production output.\n\nLet\u2019s set up the proportion:\n\n20 workers / 500 units = x workers / 750 units.\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (20 * 750) / 500 = 15000 / 500 = 30 workers.\n\nAgain, additional workers needed = 30 - 20 = 10 workers.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I\u2019m confident that the answer is 10 additional workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
