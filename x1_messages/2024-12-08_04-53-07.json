I know that for arranging letters, it's about permutations, right? But what makes this tricky is that there are repeated letters in \"MATHEMATICS.\"\n\nFirst off, I need to know how many letters there are in total. Let's count them: M-A-T-H-E-M-A-T-I-C-S. That's 11 letters.\n\nIf all the letters were unique, the number of arrangements would be 11 factorial, which is 11!. But since some letters repeat, I have to account for those repetitions.\n\nLet's see which letters repeat:\n\n- M appears twice.\n\n- A appears twice.\n\n- T appears twice.\n\n- The other letters\u2014H, E, I, C, S\u2014each appear once.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of unique arrangements when there are repeated items is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\dots \\times n_k!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items.\n\n- \\( n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k \\) are the frequencies of the repeating items.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\( n = 11 \\)\n\n- \\( n_1 = 2 \\) for M\n\n- \\( n_2 = 2 \\) for A\n\n- \\( n_3 = 2 \\) for T\n\n- The other letters each appear once, so their factorials are 1, which don't affect the denominator.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = \\frac{11!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate 11!:\n\n\\[\n11! = 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 39,916,800\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate 2!:\n\n\\[\n2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nSince there are three 2!'s in the denominator:\n\n\\[\n2! \\times 2! \\times 2! = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of unique arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{39,916,800}{8} = 4,989,600\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 11! is indeed 39,916,800.\n\nThen, 2! is 2, and since there are three 2!'s, that's 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8.\n\nDividing 39,916,800 by 8 gives 4,989,600.\n\nHmm, but I recall that for permutations with repetitions, this is the standard formula. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, if all letters were unique, it would be 11! = 39,916,800.\n\nBut since M repeats twice, we divide by 2! to account for the repetitions of M.\n\nSimilarly, A repeats twice, so we divide by another 2! for the A's.\n\nAnd T repeats twice, so we divide by another 2! for the T's.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique arrangements is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{39,916,800}{8} = 4,989,600\n\\]\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other repeating letters I might have missed. Looking back at \"MATHEMATICS\":\n\n- M: 2\n\n- A: 2\n\n- T: 2\n\n- H: 1\n\n- E: 1\n\n- I: 1\n\n- C: 1\n\n- S: 1\n\nNo, that's correct. Only M, A, and T repeat twice.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 4,989,600 unique arrangements.\n\nWait, but I recall that sometimes with permutations of multiset, the formula is indeed this. Let me confirm with a smaller example.\n\nSuppose I have the word \"BOOK\", which has 4 letters with O repeating twice.\n\nThe number of unique arrangements should be \\(\\frac{4!}{2!} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense because the two O's are indistinguishable, so we don't want to count arrangements where only the O's are swapped as different.\n\nSimilarly, in \"MATHEMATICS\", since M, A, and T each have two indistinguishable letters, we divide by 2! for each set of repeats.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 4,989,600 is the correct number of unique arrangements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4989600} \\]"
