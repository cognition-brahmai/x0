        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to form a committee of 5 people from a group of 12 men and 8 women, and there has to be at least 3 women on the committee. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least 3 women\" means. That means the committee can have 3 women, or 4 women, or even 5 women. It can't have fewer than 3 women. So, I need to consider all these possibilities.\n\nTotal, there are 12 men and 8 women, so 20 people in all. But I can't just pick any 5 people because I have to ensure that there are at least 3 women.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use combinations. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which makes sense for forming a committee.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 from 20 people is C(20,5), which is 20 choose 5. But that includes all possible combinations, including those with fewer than 3 women, which we don't want.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total number of possible committees and then subtract the number of committees that have fewer than 3 women. That might work.\n\nBut the problem says \"at least 3 women\", so that's total committees minus committees with 0, 1, or 2 women.\n\nAlternatively, I can directly calculate the number of committees with exactly 3 women, exactly 4 women, and exactly 5 women, and then add those up.\n\nI think that's a better approach for this problem.\n\nSo, let's calculate each case separately.\n\nFirst, committees with exactly 3 women and 2 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 women from 8 is C(8,3).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 men from 12 is C(12,2).\n\nSo, total for this case is C(8,3) * C(12,2).\n\nSecond, committees with exactly 4 women and 1 man.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 4 women from 8 is C(8,4).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 man from 12 is C(12,1).\n\nSo, total for this case is C(8,4) * C(12,1).\n\nThird, committees with exactly 5 women and 0 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 5 women from 8 is C(8,5).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 0 men from 12 is C(12,0), which is 1.\n\nSo, total for this case is C(8,5) * 1 = C(8,5).\n\nNow, I need to calculate each of these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(8,3) is (8*7*6)/(3*2*1) = 56.\n\nC(12,2) is (12*11)/(2*1) = 66.\n\nSo, C(8,3) * C(12,2) = 56 * 66 = 3696.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication.\n\n56 * 60 = 3360, and 56 * 6 = 336, so total 3360 + 336 = 3696. Okay.\n\nNext, C(8,4) is (8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2*1) = 70.\n\nC(12,1) is 12.\n\nSo, C(8,4) * C(12,1) = 70 * 12 = 840.\n\nThen, C(8,5) is (8*7*6*5*4)/(5*4*3*2*1) = 56.\n\nC(12,0) is 1.\n\nSo, C(8,5) * 1 = 56.\n\nNow, I need to add up all these cases: 3696 + 840 + 56.\n\nLet's add them step by step.\n\n3696 + 840 = 4536.\n\n4536 + 56 = 4592.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 people with at least 3 women is 4592.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst calculation: C(8,3) = 56, C(12,2) = 66, 56 * 66 = 3696. That seems correct.\n\nSecond calculation: C(8,4) = 70, C(12,1) = 12, 70 * 12 = 840. Correct.\n\nThird calculation: C(8,5) = 56, C(12,0) = 1, 56 * 1 = 56. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 3696 + 840 = 4536, and 4536 + 56 = 4592. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total number of possible committees without any restrictions, which is C(20,5) = 15504.\n\nThen, the number of committees with fewer than 3 women is the committees with 0, 1, or 2 women.\n\nSo, committees with 0 women and 5 men: C(8,0) * C(12,5) = 1 * 792 = 792.\n\nCommittees with 1 woman and 4 men: C(8,1) * C(12,4) = 8 * 495 = 3960.\n\nCommittees with 2 women and 3 men: C(8,2) * C(12,3) = 28 * 220 = 6160.\n\nAdding these up: 792 + 3960 = 4752, and 4752 + 6160 = 10912.\n\nNow, total possible committees are 15504, so committees with at least 3 women would be 15504 - 10912 = 4592.\n\nWait, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 4592 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. The method I used seems straightforward and consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total number of ways to choose 5 people from 20, which is C(20,5), and then subtract the number of committees with fewer than 3 women, which is what I did earlier.\n\nYes, that's the same as my first alternative approach, and it confirmed the answer.\n\nSo, I think 4592 is the correct number of ways to form such a committee.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4592} \\]"
