Each step should have an associated evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's query, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nWebSearch[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information on the internet. This tool is useful in finding relevant websites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from a website and produces plain text output containing the content of the site.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response of links.\nKnowledgeBase[input]: A tool that answers questions based on common knowledge and facts. The input must be a text question that references a :data[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the sky, given :data1:?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a data variable, e.g., KnowledgeBase[What is the capital of France, given :data3:?]\n\nEach plan should only include one evidence output.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous data, e.g., \"Given context :data0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:data[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the book \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other books did they write?"
