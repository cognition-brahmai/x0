        "content": "So there's this problem here: a box contains 15 red balls and 10 blue balls. I need to find out what fraction of the balls are blue. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think I need to know the total number of balls in the box. There are 15 red balls and 10 blue balls, so the total should be 15 plus 10, right? Let me add those up: 15 + 10 equals 25. So, there are 25 balls in total.\n\nNow, I need to find out what fraction of these 25 balls are blue. There are 10 blue balls, so the fraction should be 10 out of 25. In fraction terms, that's 10/25.\n\nBut I think I can simplify that fraction. Simplifying fractions involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same number. Let's see, what number can divide both 10 and 25? Hmm, 5 seems to work. 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 25 divided by 5 is 5. So, 10/25 simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way to confirm that? Maybe I can divide both 10 and 25 by 5 again. Wait, 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 25 divided by 5 is 5, so yes, it's 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of blue balls to total balls. The ratio is 10 to 25, which can be written as 10:25 or 10/25. Again, simplifying by dividing both numbers by 5 gives me 2/5.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about percentages. If I want to find out the percentage of blue balls, I can divide the number of blue balls by the total number of balls and then multiply by 100. So, 10 divided by 25 is 0.4, and 0.4 times 100 is 40%. So, 40% of the balls are blue, which is the same as 2/5.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the fraction, not the percentage. But it's good to know that 2/5 is equivalent to 40%.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using decimals? 10 divided by 25 is 0.4, and 0.4 is the same as 2/5.\n\nHmm, it seems like I keep coming back to 2/5. I think that's the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other simplification I could do. Is 2/5 the simplest form? Well, 2 and 5 are both prime numbers, so they don't have any common factors other than 1. So, yes, 2/5 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of picking a blue ball at random. The probability would be the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls, which is again 10/25, or 2/5.\n\nI feel confident that 2/5 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
