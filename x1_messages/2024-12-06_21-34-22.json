        "content": "So I have this problem here: \"Every day, a tree drops 7 leaves. How many leaves would it drop in a month of February in a non-leap year? Include your logic.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to figure out how many days are in February during a non-leap year. I remember that February is the shortest month, and in a non-leap year, it has 28 days. Leap years have 29 days in February, but since it's specified as a non-leap year, it's 28 days.\n\nSo, days in February (non-leap year) = 28\n\nNext, the tree drops 7 leaves every day. So, to find out the total number of leaves dropped in February, I need to multiply the number of leaves dropped per day by the number of days in February.\n\nTotal leaves = leaves per day \u00d7 number of days\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal leaves = 7 leaves/day \u00d7 28 days\n\nNow, 7 times 28. Let me do the math.\n\n7 \u00d7 28 = 7 \u00d7 20 + 7 \u00d7 8 = 140 + 56 = 196\n\nSo, the tree would drop 196 leaves in February of a non-leap year.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"include your logic.\" So, I should explain my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I identified the key pieces of information given:\n\n1. The tree drops 7 leaves every day.\n\n2. The month in question is February in a non-leap year.\n\nI knew that February has 28 days in a non-leap year. If it were a leap year, it would have 29 days, but since it's specified as non-leap, I didn't need to worry about that.\n\nThen, I recalled that to find the total amount over a period, I can multiply the daily amount by the number of days in that period. It's a straightforward multiplication problem.\n\nSo, I multiplied 7 leaves/day by 28 days to get the total leaves dropped in February.\n\nTo make sure I did the multiplication correctly, I broke it down:\n\n7 \u00d7 20 = 140\n\n7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n\nThen, 140 + 56 = 196\n\nTherefore, the tree drops 196 leaves in February.\n\nI think that's straightforward, but perhaps there's more to consider. For example, are there any variables or additional factors that could affect the number of leaves dropped? In this problem, it seems like the tree drops a consistent 7 leaves every day, so there's no variation based on weather or other factors.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the tree drops leaves every day of February, including any holidays or weekends. The problem doesn't specify any exceptions, so I proceeded with the straightforward calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether February always has 28 days in non-leap years. Yes, that's a constant in the Gregorian calendar, so I'm confident with that number.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to include the logic, which I've tried to do by explaining each step of my reasoning.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the tree would drop 196 leaves in February of a non-leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{196} \\]"
