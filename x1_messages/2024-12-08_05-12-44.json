The concept of a basis, which is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the vector space, is fundamental. For instance, in R3, the three-dimensional space of real numbers, any three non-coplanar vectors can form a basis. What is the primary requirement for a set of vectors to be a basis for a vector space?\nA. The vectors must be coplanar\nB. The vectors must be orthogonal\nC. The vectors must be of the same length\nD. The vectors must be linearly independent and span the vector space\nE. None of the above"

The vectors must be linearly independent and span the vector space\n\nExplanation: In linear algebra, a basis for a vector space is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the entire vector space. Linear independence means that no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. Spanning the vector space means that every vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. Options A, B, and C are not requirements for a set of vectors to be a basis. For example, in R3, three non-coplanar vectors form a basis because they are linearly independent and span the space, but they do not need to be orthogonal or of the same length.\n"
