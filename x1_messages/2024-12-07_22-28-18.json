        "content": "So the hospital needs to stock up on medical supplies, right? They need 500 boxes of gloves, 200 boxes of masks, and 100 boxes of gowns. The costs are $25 per box for gloves, $40 for masks, and $75 for gowns. And there's a bulk discount if they buy more than 600 boxes in total\u201410% off the entire order. I need to figure out if they should take advantage of this discount and calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many boxes in total they are planning to buy. Let's add up the boxes:\n\n500 (gloves) + 200 (masks) + 100 (gowns) = 800 boxes in total.\n\nOkay, 800 boxes is more than 600, so they qualify for the 10% discount.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total cost before the discount.\n\nCost of gloves: 500 boxes * $25 per box = $12,500.\n\nCost of masks: 200 boxes * $40 per box = $8,000.\n\nCost of gowns: 100 boxes * $75 per box = $7,500.\n\nTotal cost before discount: $12,500 + $8,000 + $7,500 = $28,000.\n\nNow, since they qualify for a 10% discount on the entire order, I need to calculate 10% of $28,000.\n\n10% of $28,000 is $2,800.\n\nSo, the total cost after discount would be $28,000 - $2,800 = $25,200.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any other way to save money or if there are any drawbacks to taking the discount.\n\nIs there a possibility that buying in bulk might lead to excess stock that expires or becomes obsolete? In medical supplies, especially for gloves, masks, and gowns, there are expiration dates to consider. So, the hospital needs to ensure that they will use all 800 boxes within the expiration dates.\n\nAlso, storing a large quantity of supplies requires sufficient storage space, which might be a constraint for the hospital.\n\nMoreover, there could be financial implications, like tying up a large amount of capital in inventory.\n\nHowever, assuming that the hospital has assessed these factors and decided that stocking up is beneficial, then proceeding with the bulk purchase makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the hospital could split the orders to avoid the bulk discount, but that might not be advantageous since the discount is 10% on the entire order, which is a significant savings.\n\nLet me see if splitting the order would result in any savings.\n\nSuppose they try to purchase exactly 600 boxes to avoid the discount, but that wouldn't make sense because the discount is for purchasing more than 600 boxes.\n\nWait, no. The discount is for purchasing more than 600 boxes, so if they purchase 601 boxes or 800 boxes, they get the same 10% discount.\n\nSo, there's no benefit in trying to purchase just above 600 to get the discount; they might as well purchase what they need.\n\nMoreover, if they purchase only 600 boxes, they might not be getting all the supplies they need, which is 800 boxes.\n\nTherefore, it's better to purchase all 800 boxes and get the discount.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the supplier offers any other incentives or if there are volume limits.\n\nAssuming not, and that the hospital needs all 800 boxes, then proceeding with the bulk purchase and the discount is the way to go.\n\nSo, the total cost after the discount is $25,200.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25200} \\]"
