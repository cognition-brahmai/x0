        "content": "Certainly! To compute the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers, we can use the relationship between the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nIn Python, we can utilize the `math` module which provides a function to calculate the GCD. Here's how you can implement the LCM function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)\n```\n\nThis function takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and returns their LCM. The `math.gcd` function is used to find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, and then the LCM is calculated using the formula mentioned above.\n\nYou can use this function by passing two integers as arguments, like so:\n\n```python\nresult = lcm(12, 18)\nprint(result)  # Output: 36\n```\n\nThis will compute the LCM of 12 and 18, which is 36."
