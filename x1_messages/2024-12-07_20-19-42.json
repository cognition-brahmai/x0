        "content": "So there's this box with 20 apples and 15 oranges. I need to find out the chance of picking something that's not an apple, assuming I pick one fruit at random without looking. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in the box. There are 20 apples and 15 oranges, so the total number of fruits is 20 plus 15, which equals 35 fruits.\n\nNow, the probability of something happening is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, I want the probability that the fruit I pick is not an apple. So, the favorable outcomes would be picking an orange, since that's the only other option available in the box.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of oranges, which is 15. And the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of fruits, which is 35.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking an orange, which is the same as picking something that's not an apple, should be 15 divided by 35.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. Both 15 and 35 are divisible by 5. So, 15 divided by 5 is 3, and 35 divided by 5 is 7. So, the simplified fraction is 3/7.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of probabilities. The probability of picking an apple would be 20/35, which simplifies to 4/7. Since the only other option is picking an orange, the probability of not picking an apple would be 1 minus the probability of picking an apple.\n\nSo, 1 minus 4/7 is 3/7, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other fruit in the box besides apples and oranges? The question says there are only apples and oranges, so yes, not an apple would definitely mean picking an orange.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It's always a good idea to cross-verify using different approaches.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. 3 divided by 7 is approximately 0.4286, which is about 42.86%. So, there's roughly a 42.86% chance of picking an orange.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the format, fraction should be fine.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to be absolutely sure. Total fruits: 20 apples + 15 oranges = 35 fruits. Number of oranges = 15. Therefore, probability of picking an orange is 15/35 = 3/7.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the chance of picking a fruit that is not an apple is 3/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{7}} \\]"
