        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about balls in a box. There are red, blue, and green balls. It says that there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, and half as many green balls as red balls. Given that there are 30 blue balls, I need to find out the total number of balls in the box.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably define what I know and what I need to find out. I know the number of blue balls, which is 30. Let's denote the number of blue balls as B. So, B = 30.\n\nNext, it says there are twice as many red balls as blue balls. So, if B is the number of blue balls, then the number of red balls, R, is 2 times B. So, R = 2 * B. Since B is 30, R = 2 * 30 = 60.\n\nAlright, now, about the green balls. It says there are half as many green balls as red balls. So, the number of green balls, G, is half of R. So, G = R / 2. Since R is 60, G = 60 / 2 = 30.\n\nNow, to find the total number of balls in the box, I need to add up the red, blue, and green balls. So, total balls = R + B + G. Plugging in the numbers, that's 60 + 30 + 30 = 120.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 30 blue balls, and red balls are twice that, so 60, and green balls are half of red balls, which is 30, then adding them up: 30 blue + 60 red + 30 green = 120 balls in total.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can set up equations to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nB = number of blue balls = 30\n\nR = number of red balls = 2 * B = 2 * 30 = 60\n\nG = number of green balls = R / 2 = 60 / 2 = 30\n\nTotal balls = B + R + G = 30 + 60 + 30 = 120\n\nAlternatively, I can express everything in terms of B.\n\nSince R = 2B and G = R / 2 = (2B)/2 = B\n\nSo, Total = B + 2B + B = 4B\n\nGiven B = 30, Total = 4 * 30 = 120\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nLet me think if there\u2019s another approach. Maybe using ratios.\n\nThe ratio of red to blue is 2:1, and green to red is 1:2, which means green to blue would be 1:2 since green is half of red, and red is twice blue.\n\nWait, let's clarify that.\n\nIf R = 2B and G = R/2 = 2B/2 = B, then the ratio of R:B:G is 2:1:1.\n\nSo, for every 1 blue ball, there are 2 red balls and 1 green ball.\n\nGiven that there are 30 blue balls, then red balls are 2*30=60, and green balls are 30, total 120.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIs there a possibility that the problem is more complex and I'm missing something? Like, maybe there are other colors or some balls belong to multiple categories.\n\nNo, the problem clearly states that there are only red, blue, and green balls in the box.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that the total number of balls in the box is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
