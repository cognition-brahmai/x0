        "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot confirm or deny any supernatural events as they are beyond the scope of scientific inquiry. Science relies on empirical evidence and testable hypotheses, and supernatural phenomena, by definition, do not adhere to natural laws and cannot be tested or observed in a scientific manner. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm any supernatural event through scientific methods. It's important to approach claims of the supernatural with a critical and skeptical mindset, relying on evidence and logical reasoning rather than accepting them at face value."
