        "content": "Let's see. The factory starts by producing 250 units every day. Then, each week, it increases its production by 10%. I need to find out how many units will be produced on the 4th day of the third week.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 10% increase per week means. Does it mean that each week, the daily production increases by 10% from the previous week's daily production?\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, starting with week 1 at 250 units per day, week 2 would be 250 plus 10% of 250, and so on.\n\nLet me calculate the daily production for each week.\n\nWeek 1: 250 units/day\n\nWeek 2: 250 + 0.10 * 250 = 250 * 1.10 = 275 units/day\n\nWeek 3: 275 + 0.10 * 275 = 275 * 1.10 = 302.5 units/day\n\nWait, but units are typically whole numbers. Maybe I should keep it as 302.5 for now and see if it needs to be rounded later.\n\nSo, in the third week, the daily production is 302.5 units per day.\n\nNow, I need to find out the production on the 4th day of the third week. Since the production rate is constant daily within a week, it should be 302.5 units on each day of the third week.\n\nTherefore, on the 4th day of the third week, the factory will produce 302.5 units.\n\nBut let's double-check if the weeks are being counted correctly.\n\nLet me map out the days and weeks.\n\nAssume starting from Day 1 as the first day of week 1.\n\nSo, Day 1 to Day 7: Week 1\n\nDay 8 to Day 14: Week 2\n\nDay 15 to Day 21: Week 3\n\nTherefore, the 4th day of the third week would be Day 18.\n\nLet me confirm if the production rate applies correctly.\n\nWeek 1 (Days 1-7): 250 units/day\n\nWeek 2 (Days 8-14): 250 * 1.10 = 275 units/day\n\nWeek 3 (Days 15-21): 275 * 1.10 = 302.5 units/day\n\nSo, Day 18 is in Week 3, and the production rate is 302.5 units/day.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 302.5 units on the 4th day of the third week.\n\nBut since partial units might not make sense, perhaps it should be rounded to the nearest whole number, which would be 303 units.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory can produce half units, then 302.5 is acceptable.\n\nI think the problem allows for decimal units, so 302.5 is fine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{302.5} \\]"
