        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train's journey. It says the train travels at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then it increases its speed to 70 miles per hour for another 3 hours. I need to find the average speed of the train during the entire journey.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, I should probably calculate the total distance the train covers and then divide it by the total time it takes.\n\nAlright, let's break it down into parts. First part of the journey: the train travels at 50 mph for 2 hours. So, distance covered in this part would be speed multiplied by time, which is 50 mph times 2 hours, which equals 100 miles.\n\nNext part: the train increases its speed to 70 mph and travels for another 3 hours. So, distance covered in this part is 70 mph times 3 hours, which is 210 miles.\n\nNow, the total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances: 100 miles plus 210 miles, which equals 310 miles.\n\nThe total time taken is 2 hours plus 3 hours, which is 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 310 miles divided by 5 hours.\n\nLet me do the division: 310 divided by 5 is 62.\n\nSo, the average speed of the train during the entire journey is 62 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst part: 50 mph times 2 hours equals 100 miles.\n\nSecond part: 70 mph times 3 hours equals 210 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 100 plus 210 equals 310 miles.\n\nTotal time: 2 plus 3 equals 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 310 divided by 5 equals 62 mph.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it differently. Maybe using the concept of weighted averages, since the train traveled at different speeds for different amounts of time.\n\nSo, the average speed could be calculated as the weighted average of the two speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nThat is, average speed = (speed1 * time1 + speed2 * time2) / (time1 + time2)\n\nPlugging in the values: (50 * 2 + 70 * 3) / (2 + 3) = (100 + 210) / 5 = 310 / 5 = 62 mph.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to calculate it by finding the harmonic mean, but I don't think that's appropriate here because the times are different for each speed.\n\nWait, when speeds are traveled for different times, the standard average is the total distance over total time, which is what I did.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if the train traveled the same distance at each speed, then maybe the harmonic mean would be relevant, but in this case, it's different times, not distances.\n\nSo, my original approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the average speed is indeed 62 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62} \\]"
