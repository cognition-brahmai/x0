        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving Station A at 2 pm going towards Station B at 60 mph, and another leaving Station B at 3 pm going towards Station A at 90 mph. The distance between the stations is 450 miles. I need to find out when they'll pass each other.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how far each train has traveled by the time they meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up, which might help in calculating the time.\n\nWait, but one train has a head start. The first train leaves at 2 pm, and the second at 3 pm, so there's a one-hour difference. That means that the first train has already been traveling for an hour before the second train even starts.\n\nSo, from 2 pm to 3 pm, the first train is covering distance alone at 60 mph. In that hour, it would have covered 60 miles (since distance = speed \u00d7 time, and time is 1 hour).\n\nThat means, at 3 pm, when the second train starts, the remaining distance between the two trains is 450 miles minus the 60 miles already covered by the first train, which is 390 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their speeds: 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nSo, with a remaining distance of 390 miles and a relative speed of 150 mph, the time it takes for them to meet can be calculated by dividing the distance by the speed: time = distance / speed = 390 miles / 150 mph.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 390 divided by 150 is 2.6 hours.\n\nNow, 2.6 hours is 2 hours and 0.6 of an hour. To convert 0.6 hours to minutes, I can multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 0.6 \u00d7 60 = 36 minutes.\n\nSo, the time it takes for the trains to meet after the second train starts is 2 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nBut the second train starts at 3 pm, so I need to add 2 hours and 36 minutes to 3 pm to find the meeting time.\n\n3 pm plus 2 hours is 5 pm, and adding 36 minutes brings it to 5:36 pm.\n\nTherefore, the trains will pass each other at 5:36 pm.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the time elapsed since the first train started at 2 pm.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time elapsed since 2 pm as t hours. So, the first train has been traveling for t hours, and the second train, which started at 3 pm, has been traveling for (t - 1) hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the first train is 60t miles, and the distance covered by the second train is 90(t - 1) miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they've covered should equal the total distance between the stations, which is 450 miles.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n60t + 90(t - 1) = 450\n\nLet me solve for t:\n\n60t + 90t - 90 = 450\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n150t - 90 = 450\n\nAdd 90 to both sides:\n\n150t = 540\n\nNow, divide both sides by 150:\n\nt = 540 / 150 = 3.6 hours\n\nSo, t is 3.6 hours after 2 pm.\n\nConverting 3.6 hours: 3 hours and 0.6 \u00d7 60 = 36 minutes.\n\nSo, 2 pm plus 3 hours and 36 minutes brings us to 5:36 pm, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the trains will pass each other at 5:36 pm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5:36\\ \\text{pm}} \\]"
