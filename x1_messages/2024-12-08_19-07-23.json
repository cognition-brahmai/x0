        "content": "So I've got this problem here from a car rental company. They charge a flat fee of $20 per day plus an additional 15 cents per mile driven. I need to write an equation that represents the total cost (which I'll call C) as a function of the number of miles driven (let's say that's m).\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about creating a mathematical equation that shows how the total cost changes based on the miles driven. So, it's probably going to be a linear equation because the cost increases at a constant rate per mile.\n\nLet me think about the components of the cost. There's a flat fee of $20 per day. That means no matter how many miles you drive, you're going to pay $20 just for renting the car each day. Then, there's an additional charge of 15 cents for each mile you drive. So, the more miles you drive, the more you pay on top of the flat fee.\n\nOkay, so the total cost, C, should be the sum of the flat fee and the variable cost based on miles driven. The variable cost is 15 cents per mile, so if you drive m miles, the variable cost is 0.15 times m, because 15 cents is $0.15.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation should look like:\n\nC = 20 + 0.15m\n\nLet me double-check that. If I drive 0 miles, the cost should be the flat fee of $20, which matches the equation: C = 20 + 0.15(0) = 20 + 0 = 20. That makes sense.\n\nIf I drive, say, 100 miles, the cost would be the flat fee plus 100 times $0.15, which is $15, so total cost would be $35. Using the equation: C = 20 + 0.15(100) = 20 + 15 = 35. Yep, that checks out.\n\nWait a minute, does the flat fee include the daily rental or is it per day? The problem says \"per day,\" but it doesn't specify how many days the car is rented. Hmm, that could be a issue. Maybe I need to consider the number of days as well.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"a flat fee of $20 per day plus an additional 15 cents per mile driven.\" Okay, so the flat fee is $20 per day, and the 15 cents per mile is on top of that.\n\nIf the car is rented for multiple days, then the flat fee would be $20 multiplied by the number of days rented. But the problem doesn't specify the number of days; it only mentions the number of miles driven. So, maybe we're to assume that the car is rented for one day, or perhaps the equation should include both variables: days and miles.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says \"as a function of the number of miles driven (m).\" It's only considering miles driven as the variable, so perhaps the number of days is fixed, or we're to consider it as a single day.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the equation C = 20 + 0.15m, assuming a one-day rental.\n\nAlternatively, if the car is rented for multiple days, the flat fee would be 20 times the number of days, but since days aren't mentioned as a variable, I'll stick with the initial equation.\n\nLet me consider another scenario. Suppose someone rents the car for 2 days and drives 100 miles in total. According to the company's pricing, the flat fee would be $20 per day for 2 days, which is $40, plus $0.15 per mile for 100 miles, which is $15, totaling $55.\n\nBut in my equation, C = 20 + 0.15m, for m=100, C=20 + 15 = 35, which doesn't match the $55 scenario. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nThis suggests that the equation needs to account for the number of days the car is rented. Since the problem only mentions the number of miles driven as the variable, perhaps the number of days is assumed to be one, or it's a parameter that should be included.\n\nWait, maybe the problem assumes a single day rental. Let me check the problem statement again: \"a flat fee of $20 per day plus an additional 15 cents per mile driven.\" It doesn't specify the number of days, but it's mentioned \"per day,\" which implies it could be for multiple days.\n\nPerhaps I need to define the number of days as another variable, say d, and then the equation would be C = 20d + 0.15m.\n\nBut the problem asks for the total cost as a function of the number of miles driven, m, which suggests that d is fixed or should be incorporated into the equation in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rental period is per day, and the customer rents it for one day, in which case, C = 20 + 0.15m.\n\nHowever, considering the earlier scenario where renting for 2 days would be C = 40 + 0.15m, which seems consistent.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the number of days, it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe I should ask for clarification.\n\nBut assuming that the rental is for one day, then C = 20 + 0.15m is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if the rental can be for multiple days, and the customer drives m miles in total across those days, then C = 20d + 0.15m.\n\nBut since the problem specifies \"the number of miles driven (m),\" and doesn't mention the number of days as a variable, perhaps d is fixed.\n\nWait, the problem is to write an equation representing the total cost as a function of the number of miles driven, m. So, m is the variable, and any other factors might be considered constants.\n\nGiven that, if the number of days is fixed, say d days, then C = 20d + 0.15m, where d is a constant.\n\nBut since the problem says \"per day,\" and doesn't specify the number of days, maybe it's intended to be for one day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation should include both variables, but the problem specifically asks for C as a function of m.\n\nI think the best approach is to assume that the rental period is for one day, making the equation C = 20 + 0.15m.\n\nAlternatively, if the rental can be for multiple days, and m is the total miles driven across those days, then C = 20d + 0.15m, with d being the number of days.\n\nBut since only m is specified as a variable, and d is not mentioned, perhaps the equation should be C = 20d + 0.15m, with d being a parameter.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. The problem likely expects a simple linear equation with m as the only variable, assuming a single day rental.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with C = 20 + 0.15m.\n\nLet me consider units to make sure they match. The flat fee is $20 per day, and the mileage charge is $0.15 per mile. Both are in dollars, so the equation makes sense in terms of units.\n\nAlso, since m is the number of miles driven, it should be a non-negative value, as you can't drive negative miles. So, m \u2265 0.\n\nSimilarly, the total cost C should also be non-negative, which it is, given that both terms are non-negative.\n\nLet me think about intercepts and slope in this equation. In the equation C = 20 + 0.15m, 20 is the y-intercept, which makes sense because even if you drive 0 miles, you still pay the flat fee of $20.\n\nThe slope is 0.15, which represents the cost per mile driven.\n\nThis linear model seems appropriate for the scenario described.\n\nAlternatively, if the rental is for multiple days, the equation would be C = 20d + 0.15m, which is a linear equation in two variables, d and m.\n\nBut since the problem specifies that C is a function of m only, I think it's safe to assume that d is fixed at one day.\n\nTherefore, the equation is C = 20 + 0.15m.\n\nLet me box that as the final answer.\n\nC = 20 + 0.15m\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C = 20 + 0.15m} \\]"
