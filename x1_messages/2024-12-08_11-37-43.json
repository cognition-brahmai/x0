        "content": "Alright, I'm going to write a Java program that acts as a basic calculator. It should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers that the user inputs. I need to make sure that the program is user-friendly and handles any possible errors, like dividing by zero.\n\nFirst, I'll start by setting up the basic structure of a Java class. Since this is a console application, I'll use the Scanner class to get input from the user. I need to import Scanner from java.util.\n\nSo, the beginning of my code will look like this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Calculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Code goes here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, I need to prompt the user to enter two numbers. I'll store these numbers in variables, probably as doubles to handle decimal points.\n\nI'll create a Scanner object inside the main method:\n\n```java\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n```\n\nThen, I'll ask the user to enter the first number:\n\n```java\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter first number: \");\ndouble num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n```\n\nAnd then the second number:\n\n```java\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter second number: \");\ndouble num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n```\n\nAfter that, I need to let the user choose an operation. I'll list the options and ask the user to input a choice, maybe using a character like '+', '-', '*', or '/' for the operations.\n\nI'll prompt the user like this:\n\n```java\nSystem.out.println(\"Choose an operation:\");\nSystem.out.println(\"+ for addition\");\nSystem.out.println(\"- for subtraction\");\nSystem.out.println(\"* for multiplication\");\nSystem.out.println(\"/ for division\");\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter operation: \");\nchar operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n```\n\nNow, based on the operation chosen, I'll perform the corresponding calculation.\n\nI can use a switch statement for this:\n\n```java\ndouble result;\n\nswitch(operation) {\n    case '+':\n        result = num1 + num2;\n        break;\n    case '-':\n        result = num1 - num2;\n        break;\n    case '*':\n        result = num1 * num2;\n        break;\n    case '/':\n        if(num2 != 0) {\n            result = num1 / num2;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n            return; // Exit the program\n        }\n        break;\n    default:\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid operation!\");\n        return; // Exit the program\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n```\n\nI should also make sure to handle the case where the user enters an invalid operation, which is why I have a default case in the switch statement.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider handling cases where the user might input non-numeric values for the numbers. Scanner's nextDouble() method can throw an InputMismatchException if the input is not a double. To handle this, I can use try-catch blocks.\n\nLet me wrap the input sections in try-catch blocks:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    System.out.print(\"Enter first number: \");\n    double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n    System.out.print(\"Enter second number: \");\n    double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n    // Rest of the code\n} catch (InputMismatchException e) {\n    System.out.println(\"Invalid input! Please enter numeric values.\");\n    scanner.close();\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nDon't forget to close the scanner at the end:\n\n```java\nscanner.close();\n```\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Calculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        try {\n            System.out.print(\"Enter first number: \");\n            double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n            System.out.print(\"Enter second number: \");\n            double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n            System.out.println(\"Choose an operation:\");\n            System.out.println(\"+ for addition\");\n            System.out.println(\"- for subtraction\");\n            System.out.println(\"* for multiplication\");\n            System.out.println(\"/ for division\");\n            System.out.print(\"Enter operation: \");\n            char operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n\n            double result;\n\n            switch(operation) {\n                case '+':\n                    result = num1 + num2;\n                    break;\n                case '-':\n                    result = num1 - num2;\n                    break;\n                case '*':\n                    result = num1 * num2;\n                    break;\n                case '/':\n                    if(num2 != 0) {\n                        result = num1 / num2;\n                    } else {\n                        System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n                        scanner.close();\n                        return;\n                    }\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid operation!\");\n                    scanner.close();\n                    return;\n            }\n\n            System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid input! Please enter numeric values.\");\n        } finally {\n            scanner.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements. The program takes two numbers and an operation from the user, performs the operation, and displays the result. It also handles errors like division by zero and invalid inputs."
