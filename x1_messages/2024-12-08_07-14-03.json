        "content": "Let's see. So, Sarah hides her favorite book in the bedroom closet before she leaves for work. While she's out, her roommate Emily finds the book and decides to move it to the kitchen cabinet, thinking that's where it should be. Then, their friend Alex comes over, finds the book in the kitchen cabinet, and borrows it without telling anyone. Now, Sarah comes back home, and we need to figure out where she'll look for her book first and what Emily will think happened to it.\n\nFirst, considering Sarah's perspective: She hid her book in the bedroom closet before she left for work. She knows that's where she left it, and presuming she doesn't know that Emily moved it, she would probably look in the bedroom closet first. That makes sense because that's the last place she remembers placing it.\n\nNow, what about Emily? Emily knows that she moved the book from the bedroom closet to the kitchen cabinet. So, if Sarah can't find the book in the closet, Emily might think that someone else moved it from the kitchen cabinet, but since Alex borrowed it without telling anyone, Emily wouldn't know that the book is no longer in the kitchen cabinet.\n\nWait a minute, let's think again. Emily moved the book to the kitchen cabinet, but Alex borrowed it from there. If Sarah looks in the bedroom closet and doesn't find it, she might ask Emily if she knows where it is. Emily would then think that the book should be in the kitchen cabinet, but if it's not there, she might be confused about where it is.\n\nAlternatively, if Sarah checks the kitchen cabinet after not finding it in the bedroom closet, and it's not there either, she might think that someone took it or that Emily moved it again. But since Emily only knows that she moved it to the kitchen cabinet, she might be puzzled as to why it's missing from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Emily didn't realize that Alex borrowed the book and took it away. So, from Emily's perspective, if Sarah can't find the book in the bedroom closet, she would suggest checking the kitchen cabinet, expecting it to be there. But since it's not there, Emily might think that someone took the book from the kitchen cabinet.\n\nWait, but according to the scenario, Alex borrowed the book from the kitchen cabinet but forgot to tell anyone. So, from Emily's point of view, she moved the book to the kitchen cabinet, and if it's not there when Sarah looks for it, she might think that Alex took it, assuming that Alex was the visitor.\n\nBut does Emily know that Alex was visiting while she was away? Wait, Sarah was away at work, and Emily was presumably at home or elsewhere, but the timing is a bit unclear. Let's assume that Emily was at home when Alex visited.\n\nSo, if Emily was at home when Alex borrowed the book, she might have seen Alex take it, or she might not have noticed. If she saw Alex take it, she might assume that Alex borrowed it. If she didn't see, she might be surprised that the book is missing from the kitchen cabinet.\n\nAlternatively, if Emily wasn't at home when Alex borrowed the book, she wouldn't know that Alex took it. In that case, if Sarah looks for the book in the kitchen cabinet and it's not there, Emily would be puzzled about where it is, thinking someone took it without informing her.\n\nBut perhaps Emily didn't know that Alex was visiting. So, she might be completely in the dark about why the book is missing from the kitchen cabinet.\n\nGiven all this, I think Sarah would first look in the bedroom closet, where she left the book. If it's not there, she might ask Emily, who would suggest checking the kitchen cabinet, where she moved it. If it's not there either, Emily would be confused and might think that someone took the book without letting her know.\n\nAlternatively, if Sarah checks the kitchen cabinet first for some reason, she would find that the book is not there, then check the bedroom closet, and it's not there either. Then, she might ask Emily, who would be surprised that it's not in the kitchen cabinet.\n\nBut based on the initial assumption that Sarah knows she left it in the bedroom closet, she would likely check there first.\n\nSo, to sum up, Sarah will probably look in the bedroom closet first, and when she doesn't find it there, she might check the kitchen cabinet next, if Emily suggests it. If it's not there either, everyone will be confused about where the book is, with Emily thinking someone must have taken it without saying anything.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Sarah will likely look in the bedroom closet first, and Emily will think the book should be in the kitchen cabinet.}} \\]"
