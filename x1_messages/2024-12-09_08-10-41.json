        "content": "Nudge theory, also known as choice architecture, is a concept in behavioral economics that suggests people's decisions can be influenced by how choices are presented to them. It was popularized by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein in their 2008 book \"Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness.\"\n\nThe core idea behind nudge theory is that by making subtle adjustments to the way choices are presented or the environment in which decisions are made, individuals can be gently steered towards making better decisions without restricting their freedom of choice. These adjustments are called \"nudges.\"\n\nFor example, placing healthy food options at eye level in a cafeteria can nudge people to choose healthier meals over less healthy options that are placed out of sight. Another example is automatically enrolling employees in retirement savings plans but allowing them to opt out if they choose to do so. This nudge increases the likelihood that people will save for retirement without forcing them to do so.\n\nNudge theory is based on the understanding that people often make decisions based on mental shortcuts, emotions, and social influences rather than purely rational calculations. By recognizing these behavioral biases, policymakers, businesses, and organizations can design environments and choices that encourage people to make decisions that are in their best interests.\n\nSo, in the context of your multiple-choice question, the correct answer would be C: \"The theory that people's economic decisions can be influenced by small changes in the way choices are presented.\" However, option A, \"The idea that people's economic decisions are influenced by their emotional state,\" also touches on a related aspect of behavioral economics, as emotions can play a significant role in decision-making. But specifically regarding nudge theory, option C is the most accurate description.\n\nOption B, \"The concept that people are more likely to make certain decisions when they are presented with a limited number of options,\" relates to the idea of choice architecture and reducing cognitive overload, which is indeed a part of nudge theory. However, nudge theory encompasses a broader range of strategies beyond just limiting the number of options.\n\nOption D, \"The belief that people's economic decisions are primarily driven by their self-interest,\" is a fundamental assumption in traditional economics but is not specific to nudge theory. While nudge theory acknowledges that people have self-interested motives, it also recognizes the influence of other factors on decision-making.\n\nTherefore, the most precise answer is C, but A also has relevance in the broader context of behavioral economics."
