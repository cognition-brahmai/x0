        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 5 defective light bulbs and 20 non-defective ones in a box, making a total of 25 light bulbs. I need to find the probability that at least one of the three randomly selected bulbs is defective. And I can't put it aside; I have to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"at least one defective\" means. It means that in the three bulbs I pick, there could be one defective, or two, or even all three could be defective. So, I need to find the probability of having one or more defective bulbs.\n\nBut calculating that directly might be complicated because there are different scenarios: one defective, two defective, three defective. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI recall that in probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1 to get the desired probability. The complementary event of \"at least one defective\" is \"none are defective.\" So, maybe I can calculate the probability that all three bulbs are non-defective and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least one being defective.\n\nThat sounds promising. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, find the probability that all three bulbs are non-defective.\n\nThere are 20 non-defective bulbs out of 25 total bulbs.\n\nFor the first bulb, the probability of picking a non-defective one is 20/25.\n\nThen, without replacement, there are now 19 non-defective bulbs left out of a total of 24 bulbs.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another non-defective bulb is 19/24.\n\nSimilarly, for the third bulb, it's 18/23, assuming the first two were non-defective.\n\nSo, the probability of all three being non-defective is (20/25) * (19/24) * (18/23).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 20/25 simplifies to 4/5.\n\nThen, 4/5 * 19/24.\n\nLet's see, 4/5 of 19 is (4*19)/(5*24) = 76/120.\n\nWait, no, that's not right.\n\nActually, 4/5 * 19/24 = (4*19)/(5*24) = 76/120.\n\nNow, simplify 76/120. Both divisible by 4: 19/30.\n\nThen, multiply by 18/23.\n\nSo, 19/30 * 18/23.\n\nLet's see, 19*18 is 342, and 30*23 is 690.\n\nSo, 342/690.\n\nLet's simplify that. Both divisible by 6: 57/115.\n\nSo, the probability that all three bulbs are non-defective is 57/115.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one is defective is 1 - 57/115.\n\nWhich is (115 - 57)/115 = 58/115.\n\nSo, the probability is 58/115.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use combinations to calculate this.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 bulbs out of 25 is C(25,3).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 non-defective bulbs out of 20 is C(20,3).\n\nSo, the probability of all three being non-defective is C(20,3)/C(25,3).\n\nThen, the probability of at least one being defective is 1 - [C(20,3)/C(25,3)].\n\nLet me calculate C(20,3) and C(25,3).\n\nC(20,3) = 20! / (3! * 17!) = (20*19*18)/(3*2*1) = 1140.\n\nC(25,3) = 25! / (3! * 22!) = (25*24*23)/(3*2*1) = 2300.\n\nSo, C(20,3)/C(25,3) = 1140/2300 = 57/115.\n\nAgain, 1 - 57/115 = 58/115.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one bulb is defective is 58/115.\n\nBut maybe I can simplify this fraction further.\n\nLet's see, 58 and 115.\n\nBoth divisible by 29: 2/5.\n\nSo, 2/5.\n\nWait, but 58 divided by 29 is 2, and 115 divided by 29 is 5.\n\nSo, 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the simplified probability is 2/5.\n\nBut wait, earlier I had 58/115, which is indeed 2/5.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2/5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I calculate the probability of exactly one defective, plus exactly two defective, plus exactly three defective.\n\nThat should equal the probability of at least one defective.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, probability of exactly one defective:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 defective out of 5: C(5,1) = 5.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 non-defective out of 20: C(20,2) = 190.\n\nSo, total favorable ways: 5 * 190 = 950.\n\nProbability: 950 / C(25,3) = 950 / 2300 = 95/230 = 19/46.\n\nSimilarly, probability of exactly two defective:\n\nC(5,2) = 10.\n\nC(20,1) = 20.\n\nSo, 10 * 20 = 200.\n\nProbability: 200 / 2300 = 20/230 = 2/23.\n\nProbability of exactly three defective:\n\nC(5,3) = 10.\n\nC(20,0) = 1.\n\nSo, 10 * 1 = 10.\n\nProbability: 10 / 2300 = 1/230.\n\nNow, sum these up: 19/46 + 2/23 + 1/230.\n\nLet me find a common denominator. 46, 23, 230.\n\n230 is the least common multiple.\n\nSo, 19/46 = (19 * 5)/230 = 95/230.\n\n2/23 = (2 * 10)/230 = 20/230.\n\n1/230 remains 1/230.\n\nSo, total is (95 + 20 + 1)/230 = 116/230 = 58/115 = 2/5.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the three selected light bulbs is defective is 2/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
