        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 km/h and it takes 3 hours. That means the distance between Town A and Town B is speed times time, so 60 km/h times 3 hours, which is 180 kilometers.\n\nNow, on the way back from Town B to Town A, the train increases its speed by 20 km/h. So, its new speed is 60 km/h plus 20 km/h, which is 80 km/h.\n\nWe need to find out how long it takes to travel back at this new speed. We know the distance is still 180 kilometers, and the speed is now 80 km/h.\n\nTime is equal to distance divided by speed, so time equals 180 km divided by 80 km/h.\n\nLet me calculate that: 180 divided by 80 is 2.25 hours.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express that in hours and minutes. 0.25 hours is 15 minutes because 0.25 times 60 minutes is 15 minutes.\n\nSo, the train takes 2 hours and 15 minutes to travel back to Town A at the increased speed of 80 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.25 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
