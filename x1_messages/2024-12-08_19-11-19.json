        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many widgets the factory produces in a day. Since it produces 1200 widgets per hour and operates for 16 hours a day, we can calculate the daily production by multiplying these two numbers.\n\nSo, daily production = 1200 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day.\n\nLet me do the math: 1200 * 16. That's 19,200 widgets per day.\n\nNext, we need to find out the weekly production. Assuming the factory operates 7 days a week, we can multiply the daily production by 7.\n\nWeekly production = 19,200 widgets/day * 7 days/week.\n\nLet's calculate that: 19,200 * 7. That equals 134,400 widgets per week.\n\nNow, we're told that the factory has a defect rate of 2%. To find out how many defective widgets are produced in a week, we need to calculate 2% of the weekly production.\n\nDefective widgets per week = 2% of 134,400.\n\nFirst, convert the percentage to a decimal: 2% = 0.02.\n\nThen multiply: 134,400 * 0.02.\n\nLet's do the multiplication: 134,400 * 0.02 = 2,688.\n\nSo, the factory produces 2,688 defective widgets in a week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nFirst, daily production: 1200 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day = 19,200 widgets/day. That seems correct.\n\nThen, weekly production: 19,200 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 134,400 widgets/week. That also seems right.\n\nNow, defective widgets: 2% of 134,400.\n\nLet me verify that: 134,400 * 0.02 = 2,688.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: if the defect rate is 2%, then for every 100 widgets produced, 2 are defective.\n\nSo, for 134,400 widgets, the number of defective widgets would be (2/100) * 134,400 = 2,688.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of defective widgets per hour and then scale it up to a week, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to, I can calculate the number of good widgets and then subtract that from the total to find the defective ones, but that should give the same result.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2,688 defective widgets per week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any assumptions I made that might not hold true.\n\nFor example, I assumed the factory operates 7 days a week. If it doesn't, say it operates only on weekdays, then the weekly production would be different.\n\nBut according to the problem, it says \"operates for 16 hours a day,\" but it doesn't specify the number of days per week. However, in real-world scenarios, factories might operate on specific days, but given that it's a production problem, I think assuming 7 days a week is reasonable unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the defect rate varies, but the problem states it's a constant 2%, so I think it's safe to use that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 2,688 defective widgets per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2688} \\]"
