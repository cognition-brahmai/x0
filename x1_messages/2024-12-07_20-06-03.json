The expression is:\n\n((8 - 3)^2 + (9 / 3) * 2) - 5 * 3 + 6\n\nFirst, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with (8 - 3), that's 5.\n\nSo, (5)^2 is 25.\n\nNext, (9 / 3) is 3.\n\nThen, 3 * 2 is 6.\n\nNow, adding that to the previous result: 25 + 6 = 31.\n\nNow, outside the parentheses:\n\n- 5 * 3 is 15.\n\nSo, 31 - 15 + 6.\n\nFirst, 31 - 15 is 16.\n\nThen, 16 + 6 is 22.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 22."
