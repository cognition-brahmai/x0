        "content": "Creating a limerick with five words that have no consonants is an interesting challenge! Since words without consonants would consist only of vowels, and in English, such words are limited, I'll need to get creative. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Let's see:\n\nThere once was a yea who said, \"Ah,\nOui, I see you, eh?\"\nIo replied, \"Ai!\"\nThus, they consigned\nTo a life of vowel-laden sighs.\n\nIn this limerick, \"yea,\" \"ah,\" \"oui,\" \"eh,\" and \"ai\" are words consisting only of vowels or, in some cases, include 'y,' which can function as a vowel. However, strictly speaking, words with only vowels are rare in English. So, I've included words that primarily consist of vowels.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider non-English words or interjections, we might have more options:\n\nIn the land of Eo, so they say,\nIa and Ae play day by day.\nOho! Io cries,\nAs they live and surprise,\nIn their vowel-filled, consonant-free way.\n\nHere, \"Eo,\" \"Ia,\" \"Ae,\" \"Oho,\" and \"Io\" are used as vowel-heavy words or names.\n\nPlease note that in English, words without any consonants are virtually non-existent, as even words like \"a\" or \"I\" are considered consonant-like in pronunciation. Therefore, this limerick pushes the boundaries of the constraint for creative purposes."
