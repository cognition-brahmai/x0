        "content": "Alright, I'll guide you through designing a Java program that connects to a MariaDB database, creates a table named \"employees\" with columns id, name, and salary, and inserts some sample data into it. Make sure you have Java and MariaDB installed on your system, and you have the JDBC driver for MariaDB.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\n\n1. **Install MariaDB**: If you haven't already, download and install MariaDB from [mariadb.org](https://mariadb.org/).\n\n2. **Create a Database**: Log into your MariaDB server and create a database. For example:\n\n    ```sql\n    CREATE DATABASE employee_db;\n    USE employee_db;\n    ```\n\n3. **Get the JDBC Driver**: Download the MariaDB JDBC driver from [mariadb.com](https://mariadb.com/downloads/#connectors). Add the JAR file to your project's classpath.\n\n### Step 2: Write the Java Program\n\nCreate a new Java class, say `EmployeeManager`, and follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Packages**:\n\n    ```java\n    import java.sql.Connection;\n    import java.sql.DriverManager;\n    import java.sql.SQLException;\n    import java.sql.Statement;\n    ```\n\n2. **Establish a Database Connection**:\n\n    You need to load the MariaDB JDBC driver and create a connection to your database.\n\n    ```java\n    public class EmployeeManager {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            // Database credentials\n            String url = \"jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/employee_db\";\n            String user = \"your_username\";\n            String password = \"your_password\";\n\n            // Load the JDBC driver\n            try {\n                Class.forName(\"org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver\");\n            } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n                System.out.println(\"MariaDB JDBC driver not found.\");\n                e.printStackTrace();\n                return;\n            }\n\n            // Connect to the database\n            try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {\n                System.out.println(\"Connected to the database.\");\n\n                // Create a table\n                createEmployeesTable(conn);\n\n                // Insert sample data\n                insertSampleData(conn);\n\n            } catch (SQLException e) {\n                System.out.println(\"Connection failed.\");\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. **Create the \"employees\" Table**:\n\n    Define a method to create the \"employees\" table with columns id, name, and salary.\n\n    ```java\n    private static void createEmployeesTable(Connection conn) throws SQLException {\n        String createTableSQL = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\" +\n                                \"id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\" +\n                                \"name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\" +\n                                \"salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL\" +\n                                \");\";\n\n        try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n            stmt.execute(createTableSQL);\n            System.out.println(\"Employees table created successfully.\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. **Insert Sample Data**:\n\n    Define another method to insert sample data into the \"employees\" table.\n\n    ```java\n    private static void insertSampleData(Connection conn) throws SQLException {\n        String insertSQL = \"INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES\" +\n                           \"('John Doe', 50000.00),\" +\n                           \"('Jane Smith', 55000.00),\" +\n                           \"('Emily Johnson', 60000.00);\";\n\n        try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n            stmt.execute(insertSQL);\n            System.out.println(\"Sample data inserted successfully.\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Run the Program\n\n1. **Compile the Java Class**:\n\n    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and compile the Java file.\n\n    ```sh\n    javac EmployeeManager.java\n    ```\n\n2. **Run the Program**:\n\n    Execute the compiled Java class.\n\n    ```sh\n    java EmployeeManager\n    ```\n\n    You should see output indicating that the connection was successful, the table was created, and the sample data was inserted.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Connection Issues**: Ensure that your MariaDB server is running and that the URL, username, and password are correct.\n\n- **JDBC Driver**: Make sure the MariaDB JDBC driver JAR is in your classpath.\n\n- **Permissions**: Ensure that the database user has the necessary permissions to create tables and insert data.\n\nThat's it! You've successfully created a Java program that connects to a MariaDB database, creates a table, and inserts sample data."
