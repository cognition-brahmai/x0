        "content": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is:\n\n4(3x - 2) = 6x + 8\n\nFirst, I need to expand the left side by distributing the 4 across the terms inside the parentheses.\n\nSo, 4 times 3x is 12x, and 4 times -2 is -8. So the equation becomes:\n\n12x - 8 = 6x + 8\n\nNow, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Let's subtract 6x from both sides to start doing that.\n\n12x - 6x - 8 = 6x - 6x + 8\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n6x - 8 = 8\n\nNext, I'll add 8 to both sides to move the constant term to the right side.\n\n6x - 8 + 8 = 8 + 8\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n6x = 16\n\nNow, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 6.\n\n6x / 6 = 16 / 6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 16/6\n\nI can reduce this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by 2.\n\nx = (16 \u00f7 2) / (6 \u00f7 2) = 8/3\n\nSo, the solution is x = 8/3.\n\nLet me check this by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\n4(3*(8/3) - 2) = 6*(8/3) + 8\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n3*(8/3) = 8\n\nSo, 8 - 2 = 6\n\nNow, 4*6 = 24\n\nOn the right side:\n\n6*(8/3) = 16\n\nAnd 16 + 8 = 24\n\nSo, both sides equal 24, which means my solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{3}} \\]"
