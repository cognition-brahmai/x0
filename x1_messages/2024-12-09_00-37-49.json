They are famous for their long migrations, traveling sometimes thousands of miles from their feeding grounds in polar regions to their breeding grounds in tropical waters. And their songs are incredible; they can sing for hours on end, and their melodies are quite complex and beautiful. I've heard recordings of their songs, and they are really mesmerizing. So, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the Humpback Whale."
