Useful for locating websites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string (which contains newline separated links), producing a plain text output containing the website(s)' content.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and returns a plain text, newline-separated list of URLs.\nInfoBot[input]: A question-answering language model that provides answers based on an input text passage. The input must be a textual question that references an :info[n]: variable.\n\nFunction inputs should be plain strings, without quotes or \"+\" symbols to concatenate a string with an info variable, e.g., InfoBot[What is the population of New York City, given :info1:?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:info0: = [Function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on result of :info0:]\n:info1: = [Next function call and input parameter, potentially referencing previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :info0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:info[n]: Containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was Leonardo da Vinci and what were some of his most famous works?"
