        "content": "Let's see. So, I have this problem here about driving at different speeds for different amounts of time and needing to find out how far I've traveled in total. Okay, so the first part is driving at a constant speed of 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. Then, I increase my speed to 65 miles per hour and drive for another 3 hours. I need to find the total distance traveled.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part, it's 55 miles per hour times 4 hours, and for the second part, it's 65 miles per hour times 3 hours. Then, I just add those two distances together to get the total distance.\n\nLet me write that down to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst part:\n\nSpeed = 55 mph\n\nTime = 4 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 55 \u00d7 4\n\nSecond part:\n\nSpeed = 65 mph\n\nTime = 3 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 65 \u00d7 3\n\nTotal distance = first distance + second distance\n\nOkay, so calculating the first distance: 55 \u00d7 4. Let's see, 50 \u00d7 4 is 200, and 5 \u00d7 4 is 20, so 200 + 20 equals 220 miles.\n\nNow, the second distance: 65 \u00d7 3. 60 \u00d7 3 is 180, and 5 \u00d7 3 is 15, so 180 + 15 equals 195 miles.\n\nNow, adding those together: 220 + 195. That should be 415 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that addition. 220 plus 190 is 410, and then plus 5 more is 415. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled is 415 miles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved here, like acceleration or something, but the problem says that the speed is constant for each segment, so I don't think I need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Both speeds are in miles per hour, and times are in hours, so multiplying them directly gives miles, which is what I want.\n\nI think that's it. The total distance traveled is 415 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{415} \\]"
