        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, especially when dealing with weighted edges. Since you've specified an undirected, weighted graph, I'll design the program accordingly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of your graph. In an undirected graph, edges have no direction, meaning you can traverse from either node to the other. Each edge has a weight associated with it, representing the cost or distance between nodes.\n\nTo implement Dijkstra's algorithm, we'll need to represent the graph in a way that allows us to efficiently access and update the distances to each node. A common approach is to use an adjacency list, where each node points to its neighboring nodes and the weights of the connecting edges.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan for the program:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Use a Map to represent the graph, where keys are node identifiers and values are lists of neighboring nodes along with edge weights.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**: Use a PriorityQueue to always select the node with the smallest known distance for processing.\n\n3. **Distance Tracking**: Use a Map to keep track of the shortest distances from the start node to each node.\n\n4. **Visited Set**: Use a Set to keep track of nodes that have already been processed to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Keep a Map to track the previous node in the shortest path for each node, which will allow us to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\nLet's start by setting up the necessary imports and defining the main class and method.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class DijkstraShortestPath {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example usage\n        Map<String, List<Edge>> graph = new HashMap<>();\n\n        // Adding nodes and their neighbors with weights\n        graph.put(\"A\", Arrays.asList(new Edge(\"B\", 1), new Edge(\"C\", 4)));\n        graph.put(\"B\", Arrays.asList(new Edge(\"A\", 1), new Edge(\"C\", 2), new Edge(\"D\", 5)));\n        graph.put(\"C\", Arrays.asList(new Edge(\"A\", 4), new Edge(\"B\", 2), new Edge(\"D\", 1)));\n        graph.put(\"D\", Arrays.asList(new Edge(\"B\", 5), new Edge(\"C\", 1)));\n\n        String start = \"A\";\n        String end = \"D\";\n\n        List<String> path = dijkstraShortestPath(graph, start, end);\n        System.out.println(\"Shortest path from \" + start + \" to \" + end + \": \" + path);\n    }\n\n    public static List<String> dijkstraShortestPath(Map<String, List<Edge>> graph, String start, String end) {\n        // Implementation will go here\n    }\n\n    static class Edge {\n        String node;\n        int weight;\n\n        public Edge(String node, int weight) {\n            this.node = node;\n            this.weight = weight;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this setup, we have a graph represented as a Map where each key is a node, and the value is a list of Edge objects representing connections to other nodes along with their weights.\n\nNext, I'll implement the `dijkstraShortestPath` method. This method will perform the following steps:\n\n- Initialize distances to all nodes as infinite, except for the start node, which is set to 0.\n\n- Use a PriorityQueue to select the node with the smallest distance for processing.\n\n- For the current node, check all its neighbors. If the distance to a neighbor can be reduced via the current node, update the distance and set the current node as the previous node for path reconstruction.\n\n- Continue this process until all nodes are processed or the end node is reached.\n\n- Reconstruct and return the shortest path from start to end.\n\nLet's proceed to implement this logic.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected, weighted graph. We will use a PriorityQueue to efficiently select the node with the smallest distance and a Map to keep track of the shortest distances.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Use a `Map<String, List<Edge>>` to represent the graph where keys are node identifiers and values are lists of neighboring nodes along with edge weights.\n2. **Priority Queue**: Use a `PriorityQueue` to always select the node with the smallest known distance for processing.\n3. **Distance Tracking**: Use a `Map<String, Integer>` to keep track of the shortest distances from the start node to each node.\n4. **Visited Set**: Use a `Set<String>` to keep track of nodes that have already been processed to avoid revisiting them.\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Keep a `Map<String, String>` to track the previous node in the shortest path for each node, which allows us to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class DijkstraShortestPath {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example usage\n        Map<String, List<Edge>> graph = new HashMap<>();\n\n        // Adding nodes and their neighbors with weights\n        graph.put(\"A\", Arrays.asList(new Edge(\"B\", 1), new Edge(\"C\", 4)));\n        graph.put(\"B\", Arrays.asList(new Edge(\"A\", 1), new Edge(\"C\", 2), new Edge(\"D\", 5)));\n        graph.put(\"C\", Arrays.asList(new Edge(\"A\", 4), new Edge(\"B\", 2), new Edge(\"D\", 1)));\n        graph.put(\"D\", Arrays.asList(new Edge(\"B\", 5), new Edge(\"C\", 1)));\n\n        String start = \"A\";\n        String end = \"D\";\n\n        List<String> path = dijkstraShortestPath(graph, start, end);\n        System.out.println(\"Shortest path from \" + start + \" to \" + end + \": \" + path);\n    }\n\n    public static List<String> dijkstraShortestPath(Map<String, List<Edge>> graph, String start, String end) {\n        Map<String, Integer> distances = new HashMap<>();\n        Map<String, String> previous = new HashMap<>();\n        PriorityQueue<NodeDistance> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(nd -> nd.distance));\n\n        for (String node : graph.keySet()) {\n            distances.put(node, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n        }\n        distances.put(start, 0);\n        priorityQueue.add(new NodeDistance(start, 0));\n\n        while (!priorityQueue.isEmpty()) {\n            NodeDistance current = priorityQueue.poll();\n            String currentNode = current.node;\n\n            if (currentNode.equals(end)) {\n                break;\n            }\n\n            if (priorityQueue.contains(current)) {\n                priorityQueue.remove(current);\n            }\n\n            for (Edge neighbor : graph.get(currentNode)) {\n                int newDistance = distances.get(currentNode) + neighbor.weight;\n                if (newDistance < distances.get(neighbor.node)) {\n                    distances.put(neighbor.node, newDistance);\n                    previous.put(neighbor.node, currentNode);\n                    priorityQueue.add(new NodeDistance(neighbor.node, newDistance));\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return buildPath(start, end, previous);\n    }\n\n    private static List<String> buildPath(String start, String end, Map<String, String> previous) {\n        List<String> path = new ArrayList<>();\n        String step = end;\n        if (previous.containsKey(end)) {\n            while (step != null) {\n                path.add(step);\n                step = previous.get(step);\n            }\n            Collections.reverse(path);\n        }\n        return path;\n    }\n\n    static class Edge {\n        String node;\n        int weight;\n\n        public Edge(String node, int weight) {\n            this.node = node;\n            this.weight = weight;\n        }\n    }\n\n    static class NodeDistance {\n        String node;\n        int distance;\n\n        public NodeDistance(String node, int distance) {\n            this.node = node;\n            this.distance = distance;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public boolean equals(Object o) {\n            if (this == o) return true;\n            if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n            NodeDistance that = (NodeDistance) o;\n            return distance == that.distance && Objects.equals(node, that.node);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public int hashCode() {\n            return Objects.hash(node, distance);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize distances to all nodes as infinite except the start node, which is set to 0. We use a PriorityQueue to process nodes based on their distances.\n2. **Processing Nodes**: For each node, we check all its neighbors and update their distances if a shorter path is found via the current node.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the end node is processed or the queue is empty, we reconstruct the path from start to end using the `previous` map.\n\nThis implementation ensures that we find the shortest path efficiently in an undirected, weighted graph."
