This includes the Renaissance period, known for its renewed interest in classical learning and values, and the Impressionist movement, which focused on capturing the effects of light and color. Given this, the correct inference about the study of Art History is:\n\nC. It involves examining different periods and styles of art.\n\nThis option best encapsulates the broad scope of Art History as described, encompassing various time periods and artistic styles. Option A is too narrow, as Art History includes both ancient and contemporary art. Option B contradicts the information given, since the Renaissance period explicitly shows the influence of classical learning. Option D is also too restrictive, as Art History extends beyond just the Renaissance and Impressionist periods, covering a wide range of historical and modern art movements."
