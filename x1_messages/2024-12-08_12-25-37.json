        "content": "So I have this problem: I've got a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and I'm drawing 5 cards one after another without putting them back. I need to find out the probability that all five cards are hearts. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that in a standard deck, there are 13 hearts out of the 52 cards. So, the probability of drawing a heart on the first draw should be 13 out of 52, which simplifies to 1/4. But since I'm not replacing the card back into the deck, the total number of cards decreases with each draw, and so does the number of hearts if I draw one.\n\nSo, for the first card:\nProbability of drawing a heart = 13/52 = 1/4.\n\nNow, if the first card is a heart, there are now 12 hearts left and 51 cards total.\nSo, for the second card:\nProbability of drawing a heart = 12/51.\n\nSimilarly, if the second card is also a heart, then for the third card:\nProbability of drawing a heart = 11/50.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\nFourth card: 10/49,\nFifth card: 9/48.\n\nSince I need all five events to happen in sequence, I need to multiply these probabilities together.\n\nSo, the overall probability should be:\n(13/52) * (12/51) * (11/50) * (10/49) * (9/48).\n\nLet me calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify each fraction where possible:\n\n13/52 = 1/4,\n\n12/51 = 4/17 (since both divisible by 3),\n\n11/50 stays as is,\n\n10/49 stays as is,\n\n9/48 = 3/16 (divisible by 3).\n\nSo now, the expression is:\n\n(1/4) * (4/17) * (11/50) * (10/49) * (3/16).\n\nI can see that the 4 in the numerator of the second fraction cancels out with the 4 in the denominator of the first fraction:\n\n(1/4) * (4/17) = (1*4)/(4*17) = 4/68 = 1/17.\n\nNow, proceed to the next fraction:\n\n(1/17) * (11/50) = 11/(17*50) = 11/850.\n\nNext:\n\n11/850 * 10/49 = (11*10)/(850*49) = 110/(41650).\n\nSimplify 110/41650:\n\nBoth numerator and denominator divisible by 10:\n\n11/4165.\n\nNow, multiply by the last fraction:\n\n11/4165 * 3/16 = (11*3)/(4165*16) = 33/66640.\n\nSo, the probability is 33/66640.\n\nBut let's check if this fraction can be simplified further.\n\nFind the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 33 and 66640.\n\nThe factors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, 33.\n\nCheck if 33 divides 66640:\n\n66640 \u00f7 33 = 2019.333..., which is not an integer, so GCD is 1.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nSo, the probability is 33/66640.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n33 \u00f7 66640 \u2248 0.000495.\n\nTo express as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.000495 * 100 = 0.0495%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 0.0495% chance of drawing five hearts in a row without replacement.\n\nAlternatively, I can use combinations to calculate this probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 hearts out of 13 is C(13,5),\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose any 5 cards out of 52 is C(52,5).\n\nSo, the probability is C(13,5) / C(52,5).\n\nLet me calculate that to verify.\n\nC(13,5) = 13! / (5! * (13-5)!) = (13*12*11*10*9)/(5*4*3*2*1) = 1287.\n\nC(52,5) = 52! / (5! * 47!) = (52*51*50*49*48)/(5*4*3*2*1) = 2598960.\n\nSo, probability = 1287 / 2598960.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 429 / 866320.\n\nThis cannot be simplified further.\n\nNow, 429 / 866320 \u2248 0.000495, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is approximately 0.000495, or 0.0495%.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 33/66640, or approximately 0.000495.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{66640}} \\]"
