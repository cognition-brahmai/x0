        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in the village, and each house has 5 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in the village is:\n\n10 houses * 5 rooms/house = 50 rooms\n\nNow, each room has 3 windows, so the total number of windows in the village is:\n\n50 rooms * 3 windows/room = 150 windows\n\nOne day, a storm broke half of the windows. So, the number of broken windows is:\n\n150 windows / 2 = 75 windows\n\nTherefore, the number of unbroken windows remaining is:\n\n150 windows - 75 windows = 75 windows\n\nSo, there are 75 unbroken windows left in the village after the storm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
