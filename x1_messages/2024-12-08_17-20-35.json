        "content": "So I've got this problem here: A bookstore has 200 books on display. Thirty percent of them are fiction, and twenty percent are biographies. I need to find out what percent of the books are neither fiction nor biographies. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are 200 books in total. Some are fiction, some are biographies, and some are neither. I need to find the percentage that is neither fiction nor biographies.\n\nAlright, so I know that percentages can be converted to decimals to make calculations easier. Thirty percent is the same as 0.30, and twenty percent is 0.20.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many books are fiction and how many are biographies.\n\nNumber of fiction books = 30% of 200 = 0.30 * 200 = 60 books.\n\nNumber of biography books = 20% of 200 = 0.20 * 200 = 40 books.\n\nNow, to find the number of books that are neither, I need to subtract the number of fiction and biography books from the total number of books.\n\nNeither = Total - (Fiction + Biographies) = 200 - (60 + 40) = 200 - 100 = 100 books.\n\nSo, 100 books are neither fiction nor biographies.\n\nBut the question asks for the percentage, not the number. So, I need to find what percentage 100 is of 200.\n\nPercentage neither = (Neither / Total) * 100 = (100 / 200) * 100 = 50%.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to do this directly with percentages without finding the number of books first?\n\nLet me think. If 30% are fiction and 20% are biographies, then the percentage that is either fiction or biographies is 30% + 20% = 50%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage that is neither is 100% - 50% = 50%.\n\nOh, that's simpler. So, directly subtracting the combined percentage of fiction and biographies from 100% gives the percentage that is neither.\n\nThat makes sense because the total percentage must add up to 100%.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 50%.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see if the numbers add up.\n\nFiction: 60 books (30%)\n\nBiographies: 40 books (20%)\n\nNeither: 100 books (50%)\n\nTotal: 60 + 40 + 100 = 200 books, which matches the total given.\n\nAnd 30% + 20% + 50% = 100%, which also checks out.\n\nLooks good.\n\nSo, the answer is 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50\\%} \\]"
