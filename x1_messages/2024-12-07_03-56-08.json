I need to find out how many marbles they have together.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many marbles John has. Since John has twice as many as Jack, and Jack has 15, I can calculate John's marbles by multiplying Jack's marbles by 2.\n\nSo, John's marbles = 2 \u00d7 Jack's marbles = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30 marbles.\n\nNow, to find out how many marbles they have together, I need to add John's marbles and Jack's marbles.\n\nTotal marbles = John's marbles + Jack's marbles = 30 + 15 = 45 marbles.\n\nTherefore, together they have 45 marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
