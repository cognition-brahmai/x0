        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls. I need to find the probability of picking a red ball followed by a blue ball, with replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"with replacement\" means. It means that after I pick the first ball, I put it back into the box before picking the second ball. So, the total number of balls in the box remains the same for both picks.\n\nTotal balls in the box: 5 red + 7 blue = 12 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a red ball first. Since there are 5 red balls out of 12 total balls, the probability is 5/12.\n\nNext, since I'm replacing the ball, the total number of balls remains 12. Now, I need to pick a blue ball. There are 7 blue balls, so the probability of picking a blue ball is 7/12.\n\nSince these are two independent events (because of replacement), I can find the combined probability by multiplying the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, probability of red followed by blue = (5/12) * (7/12).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(5/12) * (7/12) = (5*7)/(12*12) = 35/144.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 35/144.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Let's see.\n\nI could think of it as the probability of picking red first and then blue, with replacement.\n\nSince replacement ensures that the second pick is not affected by the first pick, they are independent events. So, multiplying their probabilities makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if it were without replacement, the probabilities would change for the second pick, but in this case, it's with replacement, so the probabilities stay the same.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the total possible outcomes.\n\nTotal possible outcomes for two picks with replacement: 12 * 12 = 144.\n\nFavorable outcomes: red first, then blue.\n\nNumber of red balls: 5\n\nNumber of blue balls: 7\n\nSo, favorable outcomes: 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nTherefore, probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 35/144.\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{35}{144}} \\]"
