        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if a tree grows 2 inches taller every week, how much taller will it be after a year? And I need to show my work. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many weeks there are in a year. I know that a year has 52 weeks. But just to be sure, I'll double-check that. Yeah, 52 weeks in a year is standard. So, that's one piece of the puzzle.\n\nNext, the tree grows 2 inches every week. So, if I want to find out how much it grows in a year, I should multiply the growth per week by the number of weeks in a year.\n\nSo, that would be 2 inches/week times 52 weeks/year.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nGrowth per year = growth per week * number of weeks per year\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nGrowth per year = 2 inches/week * 52 weeks/year\n\nNow, when I multiply those, the \"weeks\" unit will cancel out, leaving me with inches per year, which is what I want.\n\nSo, 2 times 52 is 104.\n\nTherefore, the tree will grow 104 inches in a year.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. 2 inches per week times 52 weeks is indeed 104 inches. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in months. There are about 4 weeks in a month, so in one month, the tree would grow 2 inches/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 inches/month.\n\nThen, in a year, there are 12 months, so 8 inches/month * 12 months/year = 96 inches/year.\n\nHmm, now that's different from what I got earlier. So, there's a discrepancy here. I got 104 inches using weeks, and 96 inches using months. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the issue here is assuming that there are exactly 4 weeks in every month. In reality, most months have more than 4 weeks. For example, a month with 31 days would have about 4.4 weeks.\n\nLet me calculate the number of weeks in a year more accurately.\n\nThere are 365 days in a non-leap year. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks in a year is 365 / 7, which is approximately 52.14 weeks.\n\nSo, using this more precise value, growth per year = 2 inches/week * 52.14 weeks/year = approximately 104.28 inches.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll stick with 52 weeks, which gives me 104 inches.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider a leap year with 366 days, that would be about 52.29 weeks, and the growth would be 2 * 52.29 = approximately 104.58 inches.\n\nBut again, for practical purposes, 104 inches is a reasonable estimate.\n\nWait a minute, I think I see where the confusion comes from with the monthly approach. If I consider that a month has approximately 4.33 weeks (since 52 weeks / 12 months = 4.33 weeks/month), then growth per month would be 2 inches/week * 4.33 weeks/month = approximately 8.66 inches/month.\n\nThen, over 12 months, that would be 8.66 inches/month * 12 months = approximately 103.92 inches, which rounds to 104 inches, matching my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the discrepancy arose because I initially assumed exactly 4 weeks per month, which is not accurate. In reality, months have varying lengths, averaging around 4.33 weeks per month.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the exact number of weeks in a year, which is 52 weeks, and calculate the growth accordingly.\n\nHence, the tree will grow 104 inches in a year.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's consider the units again. We have growth rate in inches per week and time in weeks, so multiplying them gives inches, which is the amount of growth.\n\nIf the question was asking for the total height, I would need to know the initial height, but since it's only asking how much taller the tree will be, the growth alone is sufficient.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any other factor affecting the growth, but based on the information given, the tree grows steadily at 2 inches per week without any variation.\n\nSo, my final answer is 104 inches.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert that to feet and inches, since 12 inches make a foot.\n\n104 inches divided by 12 is 8 feet and 8 inches (since 12 * 8 = 96, and 104 - 96 = 8).\n\nSo, the tree will be 8 feet 8 inches taller after a year.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the unit, inches is fine.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it in feet, it would be 104/12 = 8.666... feet, or approximately 8.67 feet.\n\nBut again, inches is straightforward and exact, so I'll stick with that.\n\nTherefore, the tree will be 104 inches taller after a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{104\\ \\text{inches}} \\]"
