        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students, and there are twice as many girls as boys. We need to find out how many girls and how many boys there are.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say the number of boys is B and the number of girls is G. According to the problem, the total number of students is 30, so we can write the equation:\n\nB + G = 30\n\nNow, it\u2019s also given that there are twice as many girls as boys. That means the number of girls is twice the number of boys, which we can express as:\n\nG = 2B\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. B + G = 30\n\n2. G = 2B\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for B. So, replacing G with 2B in the first equation:\n\nB + 2B = 30\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3B = 30\n\nNow, dividing both sides by 3:\n\nB = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 boys in the class.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, we can use the second equation:\n\nG = 2B = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 20 girls in the class.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check to make sure this makes sense. If there are 10 boys and 20 girls, that adds up to 30 students, which matches the total given. Also, 20 girls is indeed twice the number of boys, which aligns with the information provided.\n\nSo, the final answer is 10 boys and 20 girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ boys and } 20 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
