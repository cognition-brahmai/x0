        "content": "Let's see. There are four people: A, B, C, and D. Each can either tell the truth or lie. We have some statements:\n\n1. Person A says that B is lying when B says C is lying.\n\n2. Person D says that A is telling the truth.\n\nAnd we know that at least one is telling the truth and at least one is lying. We need to figure out who is definitely lying.\n\nFirst, let's try to unpack what A is saying. A says that B is lying when B says C is lying. This seems a bit nested, so let's break it down.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- L(x): x is lying.\n\n- T(x): x is telling the truth.\n\nSo, A says: L(B) when B says L(C).\n\nSimilarly, D says T(A).\n\nGiven that at least one is telling the truth and at least one is lying, we need to find a consistent set of truth-tellers and liars.\n\nLet's consider two main cases: A is telling the truth or A is lying.\n\n**Case 1: A is telling the truth (T(A))**\n\nIf A is telling the truth, then what A says is true. A says that B is lying when B says C is lying. So, if A is telling the truth, then B is indeed lying when B says C is lying.\n\nNow, if B is lying when saying C is lying, that means C is actually telling the truth. Because if B says C is lying, but B is lying, then C is not lying; C is telling the truth.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- A is telling the truth (T(A))\n\n- B is lying (L(B))\n\n- C is telling the truth (T(C))\n\nNow, what about D? D says that A is telling the truth. Since A is indeed telling the truth, D is also telling the truth (T(D)).\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- A: T\n\n- B: L\n\n- C: T\n\n- D: T\n\nBut wait, we are given that at least one is lying and at least one is telling the truth. In this case, only B is lying, and others are telling the truth. This satisfies the condition.\n\n**Case 2: A is lying (L(A))**\n\nIf A is lying, then what A says is false. A says that B is lying when B says C is lying. So, if A is lying, then the statement \"B is lying when B says C is lying\" is false.\n\nThis means that B is not lying when B says C is lying. So, B is telling the truth when saying C is lying.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- If B is telling the truth (T(B)) when saying C is lying, then C is indeed lying (L(C)).\n\nNow, what about D? D says that A is telling the truth. But in this case, A is lying, so D is lying (L(D)).\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- A: L\n\n- B: T\n\n- C: L\n\n- D: L\n\nNow, checking the condition: at least one is telling the truth and at least one is lying.\n\nHere, B is telling the truth, and A and D are lying. C is also lying. So, this also satisfies the condition.\n\nNow, we have two possible scenarios:\n\n1. A: T, B: L, C: T, D: T\n\n2. A: L, B: T, C: L, D: L\n\nWe need to find who is definitely lying, meaning who is lying in both scenarios.\n\nLooking at both scenarios:\n\n- A: T in scenario 1, L in scenario 2 \u2192 not definite\n\n- B: L in scenario 1, T in scenario 2 \u2192 not definite\n\n- C: T in scenario 1, L in scenario 2 \u2192 not definite\n\n- D: T in scenario 1, L in scenario 2 \u2192 not definite\n\nWait, none of them are definitely lying in both scenarios. Hmm.\n\nBut let's re-examine the problem. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look at the statements more carefully.\n\nLet's consider what A is saying again: \"B is lying when B says C is lying.\"\n\nThis can be rephrased as: A says that B is lying about C lying.\n\nSo, if A says B is lying about C lying, then:\n\n- If B is lying about C lying, then C is not lying. Meaning C is telling the truth.\n\nWait, but this is similar to what we did in case 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use logical equivalences.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- T(A): A is telling the truth.\n\n- T(B): B is telling the truth.\n\n- T(C): C is telling the truth.\n\n- T(D): D is telling the truth.\n\nGiven:\n\n- D says T(A), so T(D) \u2261 T(A)\n\n- A says that B is lying when B says C is lying.\n\nSo, A says: L(B) when B says L(C).\n\nThis can be written as: T(A) \u2261 (L(B) when B says L(C))\n\nNow, \"B says L(C)\" means: if B is telling the truth, then C is lying; if B is lying, then C is telling the truth.\n\nWait, no. More precisely:\n\n- If T(B), then L(C)\n\n- If L(B), then T(C)\n\nThis is what \"B says L(C)\" means.\n\nBut A is saying that B is lying in this case.\n\nSo, A says: L(B) when (if T(B), then L(C); if L(B), then T(C))\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the possible truth values for C and see what follows.\n\nLet's consider two subcases based on C's truthfulness.\n\n**Subcase 1: C is telling the truth (T(C))**\n\nIf C is telling the truth, then:\n\n- B says L(C), but C is telling the truth, so B is lying (L(B))\n\n- A says that B is lying when B says L(C). Since B is indeed lying, A is telling the truth (T(A))\n\n- D says T(A), so D is telling the truth (T(D))\n\nSo, in this subcase:\n\n- A: T\n\n- B: L\n\n- C: T\n\n- D: T\n\n**Subcase 2: C is lying (L(C))**\n\nIf C is lying, then:\n\n- B says L(C), which is true, so B is telling the truth (T(B))\n\n- A says that B is lying when B says L(C). But B is telling the truth, so A is lying (L(A))\n\n- D says T(A), but A is lying, so D is lying (L(D))\n\nSo, in this subcase:\n\n- A: L\n\n- B: T\n\n- C: L\n\n- D: L\n\nNow, again, we have two scenarios:\n\n1. C tells the truth, A and D tell the truth, B lies.\n\n2. C lies, A and D lie, B tells the truth.\n\nIn both scenarios, B has different truthfulness, A and D also switch.\n\nSo, no one is definitely lying in both scenarios.\n\nWait, but the question is to find who is definitely lying.\n\nGiven the two scenarios, in one scenario B is lying, and in the other B is telling the truth. Similarly, A and D are lying in one and telling the truth in the other.\n\nC is telling the truth in one and lying in the other.\n\nSo, no one is definitely lying in both scenarios.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that no one is definitely lying based on the given information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a third scenario or some other consideration I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps there are constraints I haven't considered.\n\nWe know that at least one is telling the truth and at least one is lying.\n\nIn both subcases above, this condition is satisfied.\n\nIs there any other possible subcase?\n\nLet me check if there are other possibilities.\n\nSuppose C is telling the truth:\n\n- Then B is lying (since B says C is lying, but C is telling the truth)\n\n- A is telling the truth (since A says B is lying when B says C is lying, which is correct)\n\n- D is telling the truth (since D says A is telling the truth)\n\nThis is subcase 1.\n\nSuppose C is lying:\n\n- Then B is telling the truth (since B says C is lying, which is true)\n\n- A is lying (since A says B is lying, but B is telling the truth)\n\n- D is lying (since D says A is telling the truth, but A is lying)\n\nThis is subcase 2.\n\nThese are the only two possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nIn one, B is lying, in the other, B is telling the truth.\n\nSimilarly for A and D.\n\nSo, no one is consistently lying in both scenarios.\n\nTherefore, there is no one who is definitely lying.\n\nMaybe the answer is that no one is definitely lying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that if D is telling the truth, then A is telling the truth, which implies B is lying, and C is telling the truth.\n\nAlternatively, if D is lying, then A is lying, which implies B is telling the truth, and C is lying.\n\nIn both cases, B is telling the truth in one scenario and lying in the other.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nA and D are both telling the truth in one and lying in the other.\n\nSo, again, no one is definitely lying in both scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trickier, and there's only one possible scenario.\n\nWait, but in the subcases, both scenarios are possible given the conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine who is definitely lying.\n\nSo, the answer is that no one is definitely lying.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No one is definitely lying.}} \\]"
