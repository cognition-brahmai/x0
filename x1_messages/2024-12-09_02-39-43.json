        "content": "Fresco was indeed a major art form during the era of the Western Roman Empire, specifically from 27 BC to 476 AD. This period is often referred to as the Imperial Roman period or the Roman Empire. Frescoes were widely used to decorate the interiors of Roman buildings, including villas, temples, and public spaces.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Roman frescoes is the Pompeian frescoes found in the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which were preserved under volcanic ash after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. These frescoes provide valuable insights into the artistic styles and themes of that era.\n\nThe term \"cornucopia\" you mentioned is often associated with frescoes and other forms of Roman art. The cornucopia, or horn of plenty, is a symbol of abundance and prosperity, often depicted spilling over with fruits, vegetables, and other bountiful produce. It was a common motif in Roman art and was frequently incorporated into frescoes, mosaics, and sculptures.\n\nDuring this era, frescoes were created by applying pigments to wet plaster, allowing the colors to fuse with the plaster as it dried. This technique resulted in durable and long-lasting artworks that could withstand the test of time, as evidenced by the well-preserved frescoes found in archaeological sites like Pompeii.\n\nOverall, fresco painting played a significant role in Roman art, reflecting the cultural, social, and religious aspects of life during the Western Roman Empire."
