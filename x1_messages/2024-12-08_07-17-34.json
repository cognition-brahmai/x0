        "content": "Alright, so I've got this question here: if you roll a standard six-sided die, what's the probability of rolling an odd number? And I need to show my work. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard six-sided die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6, right? So, the possible outcomes when I roll it are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each of these is equally likely, assuming the die is fair.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of rolling an odd number. Let's see, which numbers from 1 to 6 are odd? Well, 1 is odd, 2 is even, 3 is odd, 4 is even, 5 is odd, and 6 is even. So, the odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. That's three numbers.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are rolling a 1, 3, or 5, which is three outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is six, since there are six faces on the die.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of rolling an odd number is:\n\nP = number of favorable outcomes / total number of possible outcomes\n\nP = 3 / 6\n\nNow, I can simplify that fraction:\n\nP = 1 / 2\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2, which is the same as 0.5 or 50%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Let's see. Since the die is six-sided and half of the numbers are odd and half are even, it makes sense that the probability would be 1/2. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of probability theory.\n\nIn probability theory, for equally likely outcomes, the probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. That's exactly what I did here. So, I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that each number has a probability of 1/6. Since there are three odd numbers, I can add their individual probabilities:\n\nP(1) + P(3) + P(5) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nAgain, I get the same result. That's reassuring.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe thinking about even numbers. If the probability of rolling an even number is also 1/2, since there are three even numbers (2, 4, 6), then the total probability should be 1, because you have to roll either odd or even.\n\nLet's check:\n\nP(odd) + P(even) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think I've covered this properly. The probability of rolling an odd number on a standard six-sided die is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
