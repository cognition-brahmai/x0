The upper echelon consists of the \"Synthetics,\" individuals heavily augmented with advanced technology, granting them enhanced physical and cognitive abilities. The middle class, known as \"Hybrids,\" possess moderate augmentations and form the backbone of the city's workforce. At the bottom are the \"Naturals,\" those without any technological enhancements, who struggle in menial jobs and face severe social discrimination.\n\nCurrent Situation: The city is under a state of heightened surveillance and control, with the government maintaining power through a combination of advanced AI systems and strict law enforcement. Recent advancements in quantum computing have allowed the oligarchs to predict and suppress any signs of dissent before they escalate. However, resource scarcity and environmental degradation are causing increasing unrest among the lower classes.\n\nRebellion: A clandestine group called \"The Primitives\" is forming, composed mainly of Naturals and some disillusioned Hybrids. They advocate for a return to a less technologically dependent society and equality for all citizens, regardless of their augmentation status. Their activities are carefully hidden from the authorities, who are becoming increasingly vigilant in their efforts to dismantle any opposition."
