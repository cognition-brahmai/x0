        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class that's made up of 60% boys and 40% girls. That means, out of every 100 students, 60 are boys and 40 are girls.\n\nNow, half of the boys wear glasses. So, if there are 60 boys, then half of them would be 30 boys wearing glasses.\n\nNext, 3/4 of the girls wear glasses. So, out of the 40 girls, 3/4 of them would be wearing glasses. Let's calculate that: 3/4 of 40 is 30 girls wearing glasses.\n\nSo, total number of students wearing glasses is 30 boys + 30 girls = 60 students.\n\nSince the class has 100 students in total, the percentage wearing glasses is 60%.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of percentages right from the start.\n\nSo, 60% of the class are boys, and half of them wear glasses. Half of 60% is 30%. So, 30% of the class are boys wearing glasses.\n\nSimilarly, 40% of the class are girls, and 3/4 of them wear glasses. 3/4 of 40% is 30%. So, 30% of the class are girls wearing glasses.\n\nAdding those up, 30% + 30% = 60% of the class wears glasses.\n\nHmm, that's the same answer as before. So, it seems consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Let's assume there are 100 students in the class, as we did earlier.\n\n- Boys: 60 students\n\n- Girls: 40 students\n\nBoys wearing glasses: half of 60 = 30\n\nGirls wearing glasses: 3/4 of 40 = 30\n\nTotal wearing glasses: 30 + 30 = 60\n\nPercentage: (60 / 100) * 100% = 60%\n\nAlternatively, if we take a different class size, say 200 students:\n\n- Boys: 120\n\n- Girls: 80\n\nBoys wearing glasses: half of 120 = 60\n\nGirls wearing glasses: 3/4 of 80 = 60\n\nTotal wearing glasses: 60 + 60 = 120\n\nPercentage: (120 / 200) * 100% = 60%\n\nSo, regardless of the class size, the percentage remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the class that wears glasses is 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
