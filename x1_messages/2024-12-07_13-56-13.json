        "content": "So I need to calculate the area of a triangle, right? I know that the formula for the area of a triangle is (base times height) divided by 2. So, if the base is 12 cm and the height is 8 cm, I just plug those values into the formula.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\nArea = (base \u00d7 height) / 2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nArea = (12 cm \u00d7 8 cm) / 2\n\nFirst, I multiply the base by the height:\n\n12 \u00d7 8 = 96\n\nSo, that's 96 square centimeters.\n\nNow, I divide that by 2:\n\n96 / 2 = 48\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 48 square centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that I'm using the correct units. Since both the base and height are in centimeters, their product will be in square centimeters, which is correct for area. Dividing by 2 doesn't change the units, so yes, 48 square centimeters seems right.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe I can think about the area of a rectangle with the same base and height and see how it compares. The area of a rectangle is base times height, so that would be 12 cm \u00d7 8 cm = 96 square centimeters. Since a triangle is half of a rectangle in this case, dividing by 2 makes sense to get the area of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the area of a triangle if I know all three sides using Heron's formula, but I don't have the lengths of the other sides here. So, using the base and height is the most straightforward method.\n\nI should also consider if the triangle is a right triangle or not. In this case, since I'm given the base and height, it doesn't matter whether it's a right triangle or not because the formula applies to any triangle when base and height are perpendicular.\n\nJust to double-check, let's imagine that this is a right triangle with base 12 cm and height 8 cm. The area should still be (12 \u00d7 8) / 2 = 48 square centimeters. If it were an equilateral triangle, the formula would be different, but since it's not specified, I'll stick with the given base and height.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to visualize the triangle. If I have a base of 12 cm and a height of 8 cm, drawing an altitude from the apex to the base, the area should be half of the base times the height, which is indeed 48 square centimeters.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The area of the triangle is 48 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
