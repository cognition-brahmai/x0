        "content": "So, the city has a population of 500,000 people, and 10% of them use public transportation. To find out how many people that is, I need to calculate 10% of 500,000.\n\nFirst, I know that \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 10% is the same as 10 per 100 or 10/100, which is also 0.10 in decimal form.\n\nSo, to find 10% of 500,000, I can multiply 500,000 by 0.10.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n500,000 \u00d7 0.10 = 50,000\n\nSo, 50,000 people use public transportation.\n\nBut let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use fractions. Since 10% is the same as 10/100, I can simplify that to 1/10. So, 1/10 of the population uses public transportation.\n\nSo, 1/10 of 500,000 is 500,000 divided by 10, which is also 50,000.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, maybe I can try another method.\n\nLet's say I want to find what 1% of the population is and then multiply by 10 to get 10%.\n\n1% of 500,000 is 5,000 (because 500,000 divided by 100 is 5,000).\n\nThen, 10% would be 10 times that, which is 50,000.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 100% of the population is 500,000, then 10% would be:\n\n(10 / 100) \u00d7 500,000 = 10 \u00d7 5,000 = 50,000.\n\nAlright, no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting 50,000.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, is the population figure exact, or is it an estimate?\n\nDoes the percentage include all types of public transportation, like buses, trains, trams, etc.?\n\nBut based on the information given, I don't think any of that matters. The question is straightforward: 10% of 500,000.\n\nSo, my final answer is 50,000 people use public transportation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50000} \\]"
