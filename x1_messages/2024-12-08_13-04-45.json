It also incorporates AI-driven avatars for more natural and expressive communication.\n   - **Target Audience:** Remote teams that value a strong sense of community and interaction, such as creative agencies, startups, and remote customer support teams.\n\n5. **Personalized Wellness Pods for Remote Work**\n   - **Description:** These are compact, portable pods that provide a customizable environment for remote workers to take breaks and recharge.
