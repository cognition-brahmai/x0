The Ring's influence transformed him both physically and mentally, turning him into a slimy, dark creature who was consumed by his obsession to possess the Ring again. His real name was Sm\u00e9agol, but he was renamed \"Gollum\" due to the gurgling, swallowing sounds he made in his throat. He plays a significant role in \"The Lord of the Rings\" as both a guide and a nemesis to Frodo Baggins, the Hobbit tasked with destroying the One Ring."
