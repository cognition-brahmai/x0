        "content": "So there's a class with 25 students in total, and out of those, 12 are boys. The rest are girls, and I need to find out what percentage of the class are girls. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many girls there are. Since there are 25 students in total and 12 of them are boys, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to get the number of girls.\n\nSo, number of girls = total students - number of boys\nThat would be 25 - 12 = 13 girls.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of the class that are girls, I need to find out what part of the total student population the girls make up, and then convert that part into a percentage.\n\nThe formula for percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of girls, which is 13, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students, which is 25.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{13}{25} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nNow, let's do the math.\n\nFirst, divide 13 by 25.\n\n13 divided by 25 is 0.52.\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n0.52 times 100 is 52%.\n\nSo, 52% of the class is made up of girls.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nTotal students: 25\nBoys: 12\nGirls: 25 - 12 = 13\n\nPercentage of girls: (13 / 25) * 100 = 52%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions.\n\n25 students, 13 are girls.\n\nSo, girls make up 13/25 of the class.\n\nSimplifying 13/25:\n\n13 \u00f7 25 = 0.52\n\n0.52 * 100 = 52%\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it helps to think of proportions.\n\nIf 25 students are 100%, then 13 girls are what percentage?\n\nSet up a proportion:\n\n13 / 25 = x / 100\n\nThen solve for x:\n\nx = (13 / 25) * 100 = 52%\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 52% is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check the percentage of boys as well.\n\nBoys: 12 out of 25.\n\nPercentage of boys: (12 / 25) * 100 = 48%\n\nTotal percentage: 52% (girls) + 48% (boys) = 100%, which makes sense.\n\nYes, everything checks out.\n\nSo, the answer is 52%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52\\%} \\]"
