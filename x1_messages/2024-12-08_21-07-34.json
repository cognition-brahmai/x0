        "content": "So I need to find the limit as x approaches infinity of (1 + 1/x)^x. Hmm, this looks familiar. I think it's related to the number e, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that e, the base of the natural logarithm, is defined as the limit as n approaches infinity of (1 + 1/n)^n. Wait, that seems exactly like what I have here. So, is the answer just e?\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe there's a different way to approach this, especially since I'm supposed to show my reasoning.\n\nOkay, one way to evaluate limits of this form is to take the natural logarithm of the expression and see if that simplifies things. So, let's set y = (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nNow, taking the natural log of both sides: ln(y) = ln((1 + 1/x)^x) = x * ln(1 + 1/x).\n\nAlright, now I need to find the limit of ln(y) as x approaches infinity, which is the same as the limit of x * ln(1 + 1/x) as x approaches infinity.\n\nThis looks like an indeterminate form of type infinity * 0, because as x approaches infinity, x goes to infinity and ln(1 + 1/x) approaches ln(1) = 0.\n\nTo handle this, I can rewrite the expression as ln(y) = ln(1 + 1/x) / (1/x), which is now in the form 0/0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nAh, now I can apply L'H\u00f4pital's rule since it's an indeterminate form of 0/0.\n\nSo, applying L'H\u00f4pital's rule: the limit of ln(y) as x approaches infinity is equal to the limit of [d/dx ln(1 + 1/x)] / [d/dx (1/x)].\n\nLet's compute the derivatives.\n\nFirst, d/dx ln(1 + 1/x). Using the chain rule, this is (1/(1 + 1/x)) * d/dx (1 + 1/x) = (1/(1 + 1/x)) * (-1/x^2).\n\nNext, d/dx (1/x) = -1/x^2.\n\nSo, the derivative of the numerator is (1/(1 + 1/x)) * (-1/x^2), and the derivative of the denominator is -1/x^2.\n\nTherefore, the limit becomes: lim (x->\u221e) [{(1/(1 + 1/x)) * (-1/x^2)} / (-1/x^2)].\n\nSimplifying this, the -1/x^2 terms cancel out, leaving lim (x->\u221e) 1/(1 + 1/x).\n\nAs x approaches infinity, 1/x approaches 0, so this limit is 1/(1 + 0) = 1.\n\nSo, the limit of ln(y) as x approaches infinity is 1.\n\nBut remember that y = (1 + 1/x)^x, and ln(y) approaches 1.\n\nTherefore, y approaches e^1 = e.\n\nWait, but I thought e was defined as exactly this limit. Is using L'H\u00f4pital's rule circular reasoning here?\n\nHmm, maybe there's a better way to approach this without relying on L'H\u00f4pital's rule or potential circularity.\n\nLet me recall the definition of e. Indeed, e is defined as lim (n->\u221e) (1 + 1/n)^n, where n is a real number.\n\nIn this case, x is approaching infinity, so it's analogous to n approaching infinity.\n\nTherefore, by definition, the limit is e.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting me to derive this result without relying on the definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Taylor series expansion for ln(1 + u) as u approaches 0.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSet u = 1/x, so as x approaches infinity, u approaches 0.\n\nThen, (1 + 1/x)^x = (1 + u)^{1/u}.\n\nTaking ln of both sides: ln(y) = ln((1 + u)^{1/u}) = (1/u) * ln(1 + u).\n\nNow, as u approaches 0, ln(1 + u) can be expanded as u - u^2/2 + u^3/3 - ... .\n\nSo, ln(y) = (1/u) * (u - u^2/2 + u^3/3 - ...) = 1 - u/2 + u^2/3 - ... .\n\nAs u approaches 0, higher powers of u vanish, so ln(y) approaches 1.\n\nTherefore, y approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the expression (1 + 1/x)^x as e^{x * ln(1 + 1/x)}.\n\nUsing the approximation ln(1 + u) \u2248 u - u^2/(2(1 + \u03b8u)) for some \u03b8 between 0 and 1.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for large x, (1 + 1/x)^x is approximately equal to e, but that seems like a restatement of the definition.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the binomial theorem for general exponents.\n\nLet me try expanding (1 + 1/x)^x using the binomial series.\n\nThe binomial series says that (1 + u)^k = 1 + k*u + (k(k-1)/2!)u^2 + (k(k-1)(k-2)/3!)u^3 + ... for |u| < 1 and any real k.\n\nIn this case, u = 1/x and k = x, so:\n\n(1 + 1/x)^x = 1 + x*(1/x) + (x(x-1)/2!)*(1/x)^2 + (x(x-1)(x-2)/3!)*(1/x)^3 + ...\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: x*(1/x) = 1\n\nThird term: (x(x-1)/2!)*(1/x)^2 = (x(x-1)/2)(1/x^2) = (x-1)/(2x) = (1 - 1/x)/2\n\nFourth term: (x(x-1)(x-2)/3!)*(1/x)^3 = (x(x-1)(x-2)/6)(1/x^3) = (1 - 1/x)(1 - 2/x)/6\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, 1/x approaches 0, so:\n\nThe third term approaches 1/2\n\nThe fourth term approaches 1/6\n\nAnd in general, the nth term approaches 1/n!\n\nTherefore, the entire expression approaches 1 + 1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ... = e.\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the definition of e as a limit.\n\nGiven that e is defined as lim (x->\u221e) (1 + 1/x)^x, then the limit is simply e by definition.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but maybe the question wants me to derive it using other methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the function f(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x and analyze its behavior as x approaches infinity.\n\nTaking the natural log: ln(f(x)) = x * ln(1 + 1/x).\n\nAs x approaches infinity, ln(1 + 1/x) can be approximated using the first term of its Taylor series, which is 1/x.\n\nTherefore, x * ln(1 + 1/x) \u2248 x * (1/x) = 1.\n\nThus, ln(f(x)) approaches 1, so f(x) approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis is similar to the earlier approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the exponential function.\n\nLet me set y = (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nThen, y = e^{x * ln(1 + 1/x)}.\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, x * ln(1 + 1/x) approaches 1, as shown before.\n\nTherefore, y approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis is consistent with all the previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a substitution.\n\nLet me set t = 1/x, so as x approaches infinity, t approaches 0.\n\nThen, (1 + 1/x)^x = (1 + t)^{1/t}.\n\nNow, the limit as t approaches 0 of (1 + t)^{1/t} is e, by definition.\n\nTherefore, the limit is e.\n\nThis seems like the simplest approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the hospital rule on the original expression.\n\nWait, but it's not in a direct form for L'H\u00f4pital's rule. Maybe I can manipulate it.\n\nSet y = (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nTake ln(y) = x * ln(1 + 1/x).\n\nRewrite this as ln(y) = ln(1 + 1/x) / (1/x), which is 0/0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nNow, apply L'H\u00f4pital's rule.\n\nDifferentiate numerator and denominator with respect to x.\n\nd/dx [ln(1 + 1/x)] = (1/(1 + 1/x)) * (-1/x^2) = -1/(x^2 + x)\n\nd/dx (1/x) = -1/x^2\n\nTherefore, the limit of ln(y) is lim (x->\u221e) [(-1/(x^2 + x)) / (-1/x^2)] = lim (x->\u221e) (x^2)/(x^2 + x) = lim (x->\u221e) 1/(1 + 1/x) = 1.\n\nTherefore, ln(y) approaches 1, so y approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis is consistent with all the previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n for integer n, and show that it approaches e, and then extend it to real x.\n\nBut since x is approaching infinity, and the function is continuous, this should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the squeeze theorem.\n\nLet me consider that for large x, (1 + 1/x)^x is bounded between two expressions that both approach e.\n\nBut this might be difficult to establish.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (1 + 1/x)^x is an increasing function and bounded above by e, and therefore converges to e.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to prove that it's increasing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference between (1 + 1/x)^x and e, and show that it approaches 0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the generalized binomial theorem.\n\nWait, I think I already did that earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the logarithm again and use more terms of the Taylor series expansion.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSet y = (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nThen, ln(y) = x * ln(1 + 1/x).\n\nExpand ln(1 + u) where u = 1/x:\n\nln(1 + u) = u - u^2/2 + u^3/3 - u^4/4 + ...\n\nSo, ln(y) = x * (1/x - 1/(2x^2) + 1/(3x^3) - 1/(4x^4) + ...) = 1 - 1/(2x) + 1/(3x^2) - 1/(4x^3) + ...\n\nAs x approaches infinity, higher powers of 1/x vanish, so ln(y) approaches 1.\n\nTherefore, y approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis is consistent with all the previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the definition of the exponential function as a limit.\n\nGiven that e^k = lim (n->\u221e) (1 + k/n)^n, then setting k = 1, we have e = lim (n->\u221e) (1 + 1/n)^n, which is exactly our expression.\n\nTherefore, the limit is e.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but perhaps the question wants me to derive it using more fundamental methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the error term in the approximation ln(1 + u) \u2248 u.\n\nLet me set u = 1/x.\n\nThen, ln(1 + u) = u - u^2/2 + u^3/3 - ... .\n\nTherefore, x * ln(1 + u) = x(u - u^2/2 + u^3/3 - ...) = x*(1/x - (1/x)^2/2 + (1/x)^3/3 - ...) = 1 - 1/(2x) + 1/(3x^2) - ... .\n\nTherefore, ln(y) = 1 - 1/(2x) + 1/(3x^2) - ... .\n\nExponentiating both sides: y = e^{1 - 1/(2x) + 1/(3x^2) - ...} = e * e^{-1/(2x)} * e^{1/(3x^2)} * ... .\n\nAs x approaches infinity, e^{-1/(2x)} approaches 1, e^{1/(3x^2)} approaches 1, and so on.\n\nTherefore, y approaches e * 1 * 1 * ... = e.\n\nThis is again consistent with the previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the mean value theorem or some other calculus theorem to evaluate the limit.\n\nBut that seems unnecessary when we have multiple methods leading to the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider replacing x with a sequence that approaches infinity and see if the expression approaches e.\n\nFor example, let x_n = n, where n is a positive integer.\n\nThen, (1 + 1/n)^n is a well-known sequence that approaches e as n approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, for real x approaching infinity, the expression approaches e.\n\nTherefore, the limit is e.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the continuous version of the binomial theorem.\n\nBut I think that's similar to what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use integration to evaluate the limit.\n\nWait, that might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as a^x, where a = 1 + 1/x, and take the limit as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut that seems like going in circles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for large x, (1 + 1/x)^x is approximately equal to e, but that's essentially the definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the natural logarithm again and use more advanced techniques, like asymptotic expansions.\n\nBut that seems overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the error term in the approximation ln(1 + u) \u2248 u - u^2/(2(1 + \u03b8u)) for some \u03b8 between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, ln(y) = x*(u - u^2/(2(1 + \u03b8u))) = x*(1/x - (1/x)^2/(2(1 + \u03b8/x))) = 1 - 1/(2x(1 + \u03b8/x)).\n\nAs x approaches infinity, this approaches 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nTherefore, y approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis is again consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of infinitesimals in non-standard analysis.\n\nBut that seems too advanced for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as e^{x * ln(1 + 1/x)} and analyze the exponent.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, x * ln(1 + 1/x) approaches 1, as shown multiple times before.\n\nTherefore, y approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the definition of the exponential function as the limit of (1 + r/n)^n as n approaches infinity, where r is the exponent.\n\nIn this case, r = 1, and n is replaced by x, so again, the limit is e^1 = e.\n\nThis seems consistent with all the previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider a substitution like t = 1/x, and then as t approaches 0, (1 + t)^{1/t} approaches e.\n\nThis is essentially what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the function f(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x is increasing for x > 0 and bounded above by e, and therefore converges to e.\n\nBut proving that it's increasing might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the derivative of f(x) and show that it's positive, indicating that f(x) is increasing.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSet f(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nTake the natural log: ln(f(x)) = x * ln(1 + 1/x).\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nf'(x)/f(x) = ln(1 + 1/x) + x * (1/(1 + 1/x)) * (-1/x^2)\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\nx * (1/(1 + 1/x)) * (-1/x^2) = -1/(x(1 + 1/x)) = -1/(x + 1)\n\nTherefore, f'(x)/f(x) = ln(1 + 1/x) - 1/(x + 1)\n\nNow, f'(x) = f(x) * [ln(1 + 1/x) - 1/(x + 1)]\n\nTo determine the sign of f'(x), I need to see if ln(1 + 1/x) - 1/(x + 1) is positive or negative.\n\nBut ln(1 + 1/x) \u2248 1/x - 1/(2x^2) + ..., and 1/(x + 1) \u2248 1/x - 1/x^2 + ...\n\nTherefore, ln(1 + 1/x) - 1/(x + 1) \u2248 (1/x - 1/(2x^2)) - (1/x - 1/x^2) = (-1/(2x^2) + 1/x^2) = 1/(2x^2)\n\nWhich is positive for x > 0.\n\nTherefore, f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is increasing for x > 0.\n\nSince f(x) is increasing and bounded above by e, it must converge to e as x approaches infinity.\n\nThis provides additional confirmation that the limit is e.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the squeeze theorem by finding two functions that bound (1 + 1/x)^x and both approach e as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut constructing such functions might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference between (1 + 1/x)^x and e and show that it approaches 0.\n\nBut that seems similar to what I've already done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the expansion of (1 + 1/x)^x in terms of its Taylor series.\n\nBut that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the limit of (1 + 1/x)^x as x approaches infinity using logarithmic differentiation.\n\nWait, I think I already did that earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (1 + 1/x)^x is equal to e^{x * ln(1 + 1/x)}, and since x * ln(1 + 1/x) approaches 1, the expression approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the error in the approximation and show that it vanishes as x approaches infinity.\n\nFor example, using the Taylor series expansion of ln(1 + u) up to higher orders and showing that the higher-order terms become negligible.\n\nBut that seems like an extension of what I've already done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of limits of sequences and relate it to the continuous variable x.\n\nBut that might not be necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression in terms of hyperreal numbers or other advanced mathematical concepts, but that seems beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider plotting the function and observing its behavior as x approaches infinity, but that's not a rigorous mathematical approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values of x and see that (1 + 1/x)^x approaches e.\n\nFor example, let x = 1000, then (1 + 1/1000)^1000 \u2248 2.71692, which is close to e \u2248 2.71828.\n\nSimilarly, for x = 1,000,000, (1 + 1/1,000,000)^1,000,000 \u2248 2.71828, which is even closer to e.\n\nThis provides numerical evidence that the limit is e, but it's not a proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the definition of e as the base for which the derivative of e^x is e^x, but I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the integral definition of ln(x) and relate it to the expression, but that seems too convoluted for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the mean value theorem for logarithms or exponents, but I don't recall such a theorem off the top of my head.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as a composition of functions and use the limit chain rule.\n\nLet me see.\n\nSet g(x) = 1 + 1/x and h(x) = x.\n\nThen, (1 + 1/x)^x = e^{x * ln(1 + 1/x)} = e^{h(x) * ln(g(x))}.\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, h(x) approaches infinity and ln(g(x)) approaches 0, so their product approaches 1, as shown before.\n\nTherefore, the expression approaches e^1 = e.\n\nThis seems consistent with previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider using the hospital rule on the original expression after taking logarithms, but I think I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the definition of e as the limit of (1 + r/n)^n as n approaches infinity, where r = 1, and note that this is exactly our expression with x in place of n.\n\nTherefore, the limit is e.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but perhaps the question is testing my ability to derive this result using other methods.\n\nGiven that multiple approaches lead to the same conclusion, and considering the consistency across different methods, I am confident that the limit as x approaches infinity of (1 + 1/x)^x is e.\n\nTherefore, the answer is e.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{e} \\]"
