So, to find out how much they earn in one day, we can multiply their hourly wage by the number of hours they work per day.\n\nThat would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily Earnings} = 20 \\, \\text{USD/hour} \\times 8 \\, \\text{hours/day} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 8 = 160 \\, \\text{USD/day} \\]\n\nSo, they earn $160 each day.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much they earn in a month with 22 working days. To do that, we'll multiply their daily earnings by the number of working days in the month.\n\n\\[ \\text{Monthly Earnings} = 160 \\, \\text{USD/day} \\times 22 \\, \\text{days/month} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ 160 \\times 22 = 3520 \\, \\text{USD/month} \\]\n\nTherefore, the person earns $3,520 in a month with 22 working days.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again:\n\nHourly wage: $20\n\nHours per day: 8\n\nSo, daily earnings: $20 \u00d7 8 = $160\n\nNumber of working days in the month: 22\n\nMonthly earnings: $160 \u00d7 22\n\nLet me do the multiplication again: 160 \u00d7 20 = 3200, and 160 \u00d7 2 = 320. Adding those together: 3200 + 320 = 3520.\n\nYes, that checks out. $3,520 per month.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, sometimes people might consider overtime or other factors, but based on the information given, we're assuming a standard schedule without any overtime.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that some countries or companies might have different policies regarding working hours and pay, but in this scenario, it's straightforward: $20 per hour for 8 hours a day, 22 days a month.\n\nSo, the final answer is $3,520 per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3520} \\]"
