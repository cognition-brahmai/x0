        "content": "So I have this probability problem here. There are 50 red balls and 50 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 100 balls. I draw one ball without looking, then put it back and mix the balls again. I need to find the probability of drawing a red ball after having drawn a blue ball.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. There are two draws, and each time I put the ball back after drawing it. So, the total number of balls remains the same for each draw, which is 100 balls.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of drawing a red ball after having drawn a blue ball. So, it's like two consecutive draws: first a blue ball, then a red ball.\n\nSince I'm putting the ball back each time, the draws are independent events. That means the outcome of the first draw doesn't affect the outcome of the second draw.\n\nIn probability, when events are independent, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, P(red after blue) = P(blue on first draw) * P(red on second draw)\n\nFirst, let's find P(blue on first draw). There are 50 blue balls out of 100 total balls.\n\nP(blue on first draw) = 50/100 = 1/2\n\nNext, P(red on second draw). Since I'm putting the ball back, the total number of balls is still 100, with 50 red balls.\n\nP(red on second draw) = 50/100 = 1/2\n\nNow, multiply these probabilities together:\n\nP(red after blue) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball after having drawn a blue ball is 1/4 or 25%.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that in some probability problems, the order matters, and sometimes it doesn't. In this case, since the draws are independent, the order doesn't affect the probability.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Maybe I can consider the sample space of all possible outcomes for two draws.\n\nEach draw has two possible outcomes: red or blue.\n\nSo, for two draws, the possible outcomes are:\n\n1. Red followed by red\n\n2. Red followed by blue\n\n3. Blue followed by red\n\n4. Blue followed by blue\n\nEach of these has a probability of (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4, since each draw is independent.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of \"red after blue,\" which corresponds to outcome 3: blue followed by red.\n\nSo, again, the probability is 1/4 or 25%.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any dependency between the draws? The problem says I put the ball back and mix the balls again, so the draws should be independent.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the conditional probability. The probability of drawing a red ball given that I have already drawn a blue ball.\n\nIn conditional probability, P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B)\n\nHere, A is drawing a red ball on the second draw, and B is drawing a blue ball on the first draw.\n\nSo, P(red on second | blue on first) = P(blue on first and red on second)/P(blue on first)\n\nWe already have:\n\nP(blue on first and red on second) = 1/4\n\nP(blue on first) = 1/2\n\nTherefore, P(red on second | blue on first) = (1/4)/(1/2) = 1/2\n\nWait, now I'm getting 1/2. But earlier I thought it was 1/4.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me check. In the case of independent events, P(A|B) should indeed be equal to P(A), because the outcome of B doesn't affect A.\n\nSo, P(red on second draw | blue on first draw) = P(red on second draw) = 1/2\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 1/4. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. The confusion is between the probability of both events happening in sequence, which is 1/4, and the conditional probability of the second event given the first event has occurred, which is 1/2.\n\nThe problem says \"the probability of drawing a red ball after having drawn a blue ball.\" This sounds like a conditional probability: given that the first draw was blue, what is the probability that the second draw is red.\n\nSo, the correct interpretation is P(red on second draw | blue on first draw), which is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, intuitively, since I'm putting the ball back, the second draw should be independent of the first, so the probability of drawing a red ball should still be 1/2, regardless of what was drawn first.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 1/2.\n\nI think I got confused because initially, I was calculating the probability of both events happening in sequence, but the problem is actually asking for the conditional probability.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/2 or 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
