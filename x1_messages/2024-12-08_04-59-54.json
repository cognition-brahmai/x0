        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It's currently 20 feet long and 10 feet wide. The owner wants to double the area by either increasing just the length or just the width, but not both. I need to figure out how much to increase one of those dimensions to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the current area of the garden is. For a rectangle, area is length times width, right? So, 20 feet times 10 feet equals 200 square feet. That's the original area.\n\nNow, the owner wants to double that area. So, the new area should be 2 times 200, which is 400 square feet.\n\nNext, I need to see what happens if I increase just the length while keeping the width the same, or vice versa.\n\nLet's consider increasing the length first. The width stays at 10 feet, and I need the new length, let's call it L, such that L times 10 equals 400 square feet.\n\nSo, L * 10 = 400.\n\nTo find L, I can divide both sides by 10: L = 400 / 10 = 40 feet.\n\nThat means the new length should be 40 feet. But the original length was 20 feet, so the increase in length would be 40 - 20 = 20 feet.\n\nNow, let's look at the other option: increasing the width while keeping the length the same.\n\nThe length stays at 20 feet, and the new width, let's call it W, should satisfy 20 times W equals 400 square feet.\n\nSo, 20 * W = 400.\n\nSolving for W, I get W = 400 / 20 = 20 feet.\n\nThe original width was 10 feet, so the increase in width would be 20 - 10 = 10 feet.\n\nInteresting. So, to double the area, the owner could either increase the length by 20 feet or increase the width by 10 feet, keeping the other dimension constant.\n\nBut the question is, how much should they increase the length or the width while keeping the other dimension constant. It seems like it's asking for both options.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- If increasing the length only: increase by 20 feet.\n\n- If increasing the width only: increase by 10 feet.\n\nI think that's the answer. But maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the original area: 20 feet * 10 feet = 200 square feet. That's correct.\n\nDoubling the area: 2 * 200 = 400 square feet. That's correct.\n\nFor increasing the length:\n\nL * 10 = 400 \u2192 L = 40 feet.\n\nIncrease in length: 40 - 20 = 20 feet.\n\nFor increasing the width:\n\n20 * W = 400 \u2192 W = 20 feet.\n\nIncrease in width: 20 - 10 = 10 feet.\n\nEverything seems to check out. I think this is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20 \\text{ feet in length or } 10 \\text{ feet in width}} \\]"
