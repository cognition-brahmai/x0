So, the correct answer is E.\n\nTo elaborate, the concept of a nudge was popularized by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein in their book \"Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness.\" A nudge is a way to influence decisions in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing economic incentives. The idea is to make positive choices easier or more appealing, thereby encouraging people to make better decisions for themselves and society.\n\nFor example, placing fruits at eye level in a cafeteria while placing unhealthy snacks out of reach can nudge people towards healthier eating choices. This arrangement doesn't prevent anyone from choosing the less healthy option; it simply makes the healthier choice more convenient and appealing.\n\nNudges can be applied in various areas such as public policy, marketing, and personal decision-making to help individuals make better choices without forcing them into any particular action."
