Just hours before forced spending cuts hit Americans all across the country. BERMAN And the embattled CEO of the popular daily deal site, GroupOn, makes a dramatic exit from the company he co-founded. Also, a show dog dies only days after the renown Westminster dog show. Why a vet suspects poisoning and its owner suspects foul play? We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I\\'m Wolf Blitzer. You\\'re in the SITUATION ROOM. BLITZER: $85 billion once again of forced spending cuts about to kick in all across the country less than seven hours from now, all because Republicans and Democrats here in Washington failed to come together once again to stop it from happening. Just hours ago, a feisty President Obama entered the White House briefing room. He laid the blame squarely at the feet of the GOP. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: None of this is necessary. It\\'s happening because a choice that Republicans in Congress have made. They have allowed these cuts to happen, because they refused to budge on closing a single wasteful loophole to help reduce the deficit. As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect special interests tax breaks for the well-off and the well-connected, and they think that that\\'s apparently more important than protecting our military or middle class families from the pain of these cuts. BLITZER: Chances are you\\'re going to eventually feel these cuts at least one way or another and our CNN reporters are covering every angle of the story. Let\\'s get straight to Capitol Hill. Our chief Congressional correspondent, Dana Bash, is standing by. Dana, so, what\\'s the Republican reaction? What are they saying now? Is there a risk of a domino effect being set in motion here? What\\'s going on? DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, there\\'s always that risk, but you know, Wolf, the president said that he wants to stop careening from one crisis to another, but thanks to a budget process that Congress passed and the president signed into law. We are going to continue to do that, and another Washington drama is right around the corner. BASH (voice-over): The House speaker walked out of an unproductive White House meeting about spending cuts going into effect now, and instead, focused on the next looming crisis, the end of this month, March 27th, when funding for the government runs out. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER: I\\'m hopeful that we won\\'t have to deal with a threat of a government shutdown while we\\'re dealing with the sequester at the same time. The House will act next week and I hope the Senate will follow suit. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How\\'d it go -- BASH: John Boehner and House Republicans plan to pass a bill next week to keep the government funded through September 30th, the end of the fiscal year, and along with that, deal with some of the pain from forced cuts going into effect now, just for the military, by giving the Pentagon some leeway in its new budget. REP. MAC THORNBERRY, (R) ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: It is going to help update the categories which will reduce some of the damage. BASH: But that does not necessarily mean crisis averted. Why? Congressional Democrats are skeptical about helping the military and not other Americans hit by spending cuts like children and head start (ph) programs. SEN. BARBARA MIKULSKI, (D) APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIR: We need to have programs in there, the need compelling (ph) human need, housing, education, health care, and we also need to look at transportation. BASH: Senator Barbara Mikulski who heads the community and charge of spending at work while most of her Senate colleagues are home for the weekend, expressed frustration that Congress is gone. MIKULSKI: I\\'m here. I\\'m ready to go. I\\'m waiting for the photo-op at the White House to come here to give me instructions. BASH: Speaking of Congress skipping town, the president took note of the empty capital while trying to put real life faces on forced spending cuts. OBAMA: Now that Congress has left, somebody\\'s going to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the garbage. They\\'re going to have less pay. The janitors, the security guards. They just got a pay cut, and they\\'ve got to figure out how to manage that. BASH: But we checked on that, and it turns out the president was not exactly right. The Senate sergeant at arms told CNN neither Capitol police nor janitors will see salaries slashed, only limited overtime. The only annouced effect so far at the Capitol is some entrances will close, a small inconvenience to lawmakers and their aides. BASH (on-camera): Now, when it comes to the prospects of a government shutdown, the president made it pretty clear today that he does not want that to happen, and Wolf, I\\'m told that Senate Democrats took that as a signal that they better figure out a way for them to actually bridge their differences, very real differences over the budget in the next potential shutdown with Republicans in the House. BLITZER: What\\'s the difference between giving the president some flexibility and how to deal with these spending cuts as opposed to the leeway that some Republicans want to give them? There\\'s a nuance here that potentially could be important as far as a government shutdown. BASH: There is an important nuance. I\\'ll try to do this without my weed whacker. We spent a lot of time this afternoon on the phone with people who are experts on this, but the bottom line is that when you talk about the term flexibility in budget terms, that is a signal that it would give the president a lot of ability to move money around, which Democrats and Republicans, mostly Democrats at this point say that they don\\'t want to do because it gives up Congress\\' power of the purse and for a lot of other reasons. The way that the House Republicans are writing this legislation is more about giving -- and, again, this is the controversy from their perspective, which is the Pentagon, giving the Pentagon the ability to deal with some of the shortfalls in the Pentagon budget from these forced spending cuts and from other problems of the past three years of not having new spending bills pass because they\\'ve just been kicking the can down the road. So, that is the big difference. But again, when you look at the bigger level difference between the parties, it\\'s that Republicans want to just deal with the military and Democrats say, well, if we\\'re going to try to help the military, we want to help everybody else domestically. And that really is the fundamental -- again, philosophical issue that we\\'re probably going to see play out over the next couple of weeks. BLITZER: Nobody wants to see the government shutdown, but the devil, as we say, is in the details. All right. Dana, thank you very much. Just a little while ago, the new defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, gave some strong warnings about these forced cuts. Our Pentagon correspondent, Chris Lawrence, is covering this part of the story. What did he say, Chris? CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, we have now learned that the navy is going to shut down an entire air wing in April. Now, the navy only has nine of these, and these squadrons of jets are the primary fire power onboard aircraft carriers. The navy will also shut down three more air wings over the course of the year. LAWRENCE (voice-over): Wars have been planned inside the tank, this secure room in the Pentagon few get to see. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Secretary, welcome to the tank. LAWRENCE: Now, it\\'s where military officials are making plans to cut $46 billion from their budget. CHUCK HAGEL, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Effectively immediately, air force flying hours will be cut back. ASHTON CARTER, DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY: If you stop training for a while and you\\'re a combat pilot, then you lose your rating, and eventually, can\\'t fly at all. LAWRENCE: Here\\'s what\\'s already happened. The Pentagon warned its 800,000 civilian workers to expect furloughs and instituted a hiring freeze. It also curtailed building maintenance. The navy postponed the U.S. Harry Truman\\'s deployment to the Persian Gulf and delayed the overhaul of the USS Lincoln. Here\\'s what happens next. The Pentagon will cancel maintenance on 25 ships and nearly 500 aircraft. The army will cut training time for most soldiers. Down the road, it could lead to a delay in deploying troops to Afghanistan. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We\\'ll have to make a decision somewhere along the line to either extend those already there or send people there that are not ready. LAWRENCE: And families will have to wait longer for veterans\\' funerals at Arlington. Furloughs will be fewer people to schedule services and dig graves. LAWRENCE (on-camera): Now, not all civilians workers are going to be furloughed. But for the ones that are, they\\'re going to get an official notice in the next two weeks. And starting in April, they will likely lose one day, you know, per week, lose one day of pay per week for about 22 weeks, Wolf. BLITZER: That\\'s 20 percent of their salary. That\\'s significant. All right. Chris Lawrence, thank you. Some of the Obama administration are warning that these forced budget cuts could take on a big toll on children. Our national political correspondent, Jim Acosta, is here in the SITUATION ROOM looking into this part of the story. What do you see? JIM ACOSTA, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, all week, cabinet secretaries have been warning of all of the various ways these cuts will hurt. Republicans have accused the administration of hype, and now, the nation is about to figure out who\\'s right. ACOSTA (voice-over): When two cabinet secretaries visited this elementary school just outside of the nation\\'s capital, there was music and even a reading of the Dr. Seuss classic, \"Green Eggs and Ham\". UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them. ACOSTA: All of it stage to drive home their point that it\\'s the kids who will have to swallow some of the forced budget cuts. ARNE DUNCAN, EDUCATION SECRETARY: Dumb government at its finest. KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: I guess I\\'m a little more blunt. To me, it\\'s stupid government. ACOSTA: The secretaries Arne Duncan and Kathleen Sebelius were careful not to accept any of the blame. (on-camera) Didn\\'t this dumb and stupid idea come from the White House? SEBELIUS: Actually, the idea was designed in such a way and really inserted in the bill by Congress because they thought it was such a bad way to run government that it would never happen. ACOSTA (voice-over): Worried about how the cuts will affect the schools\\' programs for at-risk children, the head of the PTA, Mindy Kassarba, has a message for the politicians. MINDY KASSARBA, ROLLING TERRACE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PTA PRESIDENT: I think that they need to grow up. Act like our children would. Talk to one another. Resolve the conflict. Maybe they need to come to the playground. ACOSTA: Perhaps, they might need fifth grader, Erik Perez. You\\'re worried that it might hurt your school? ERIK PEREZ, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENT: it might hurt my school, it might hurt my education, the teachers. ACOSTA: It\\'s not just cuts at schools. Across Washington, reality is settling in for federal workers. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know I will get furloughed. I\\'ve accepted that. ACOSTA: The furloughs, as it\\'s explained in this letter to justice department employees says, \"you will be in a non-pay, non-duty status.\" Back at the school, Arne Duncan tried to clarify his own comments about job cuts from earlier this week. DUNCAN: These are teachers who are getting pink slips now. ACOSTA: When he seemed to suggest teachers were already being laid off. DUNCAN: That\\'s not what I said. That\\'s not what I meant. But let\\'s not -- ACOSTA (on-camera): You said now. You said they\\'re being laid off now. DUNCAN: I said they\\'re getting slips now, notices now. So, that\\'s, I think, were some of the misunderstanding was. ACOSTA (voice-over): Mindy Kassarba says, perhaps, it\\'s time for both sides to go back to school. KASSARBA: If there\\'s a conflict on the playground and two kids want the same basketball, they have to talk. They have to decide. They may not be friends. They may never be friends, but they have to decide that one gets it for a little bit and then you get it later. ACOSTA: What a concept. Sharing. Something like that. KASSARBA: Negotiating. ACOSTA: Yes. Negotiating. KASSARBA: Compromise. ACOSTA: Compromise. KASSARBA: Yes. ACOSTA (on-camera): For now, there is no talk of compromise. Both sides are still holding their ground and the budget knives are coming out. And Wolf, as far as it stands right now, these cuts won\\'t be saved by the bell. BLITZER: They won\\'t be, indeed. They\\'re going to go into effect, although the pain won\\'t really be felt, I\\'m guessing, at least for two or three or four weeks. ACOSTA: That\\'s right. And that\\'s when we\\'re going to find out who\\'s right in this scenario. There\\'s been all this criticism of Arne Duncan, the various cabinet secretaries. They\\'ve been accused of hyping these numbers and so forth, but when the cuts start settling in and people start feeling them, then perhaps, we might have to revisit those conversations. BLITZER: I\\'m sure they will. Thanks very much. ACOSTA: You bet. BLITZER: Anderson Cooper, by the way, is going to have a lot more on these forced spending cuts later tonight, 8:00 p.m. eastern. Republican senator, John McCain, will be his special guest. He\\'ll talk about what it\\'s going to take to get out of this mess. When we come back, the governor of Michigan announced his plans for an emergency takeover to pull Detroit back from the brink of bankruptcy. The governor standing by to join us live. That\\'s next.
