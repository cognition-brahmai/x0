The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that the distance between Town A and Town B is 240 kilometers and the train's constant speed is 80 kilometers per hour, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{240 \\text{ km}}{80 \\text{ km/h}} \\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, it takes the train 3 hours to reach Town B from Town A at a constant speed of 80 kilometers per hour."
