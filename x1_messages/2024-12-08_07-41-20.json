        "content": "The primary purpose of a constructed wetland in environmental engineering is to treat wastewater or stormwater. So, the correct answer is C. To treat wastewater or stormwater.\n\nConstructed wetlands are engineered systems that use natural processes involving wetland vegetation, soils, and their associated microorganisms to treat different types of wastewater, including domestic sewage, industrial effluents, and stormwater runoff. These systems are designed to mimic the water purification processes that occur in natural wetlands, providing an effective, low-maintenance, and environmentally friendly method for wastewater treatment.\n\nThere are different types of constructed wetlands, including subsurface flow and surface flow systems, each designed to handle specific types and volumes of wastewater. In subsurface flow wetlands, wastewater flows through the substrate (usually gravel or sand) below the surface, while in surface flow wetlands, water flows across the surface of the wetland, similar to natural marshes.\n\nThe treatment processes in constructed wetlands include physical filtration, biological degradation, nutrient uptake by plants, and microbial activity. These processes help to remove pollutants such as suspended solids, organic matter, nutrients (like nitrogen and phosphorus), pathogens, and other contaminants from the wastewater.\n\nWhile constructed wetlands do provide habitat for wildlife and can serve as recreational areas, these are secondary benefits rather than the primary purpose. Preventing soil erosion is also an important function of natural wetlands, but in the context of constructed wetlands in environmental engineering, the main focus is on wastewater treatment.\n\nSo, to summarize, the primary purpose is to treat wastewater or stormwater, making option C the correct choice."
