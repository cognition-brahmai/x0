        "content": "So I've got this function, f(x) = (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2), and I need to find its limit as x approaches 2. Now, I know that limits are about seeing what value the function gets really close to, even if it doesn't actually reach that point. So, let's dive into this.\n\nFirst off, if I try to plug in x = 2 directly into the function, I get (2^2 - 4)/(2 - 2) = (4 - 4)/(0) = 0/0. Hmm, that's a problem because division by zero is undefined. So, direct substitution doesn't work here. That means I need to find another way to simplify the expression or rewrite it so that I can find the limit.\n\nI remember that in algebra, when I have a difference of squares in the numerator, I can factor it. Let's see if that applies here. The numerator is x^2 - 4, which is indeed a difference of squares because x^2 is a square of x and 4 is a square of 2. So, I can factor it as (x - 2)(x + 2).\n\nSo, f(x) = (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2) = [(x - 2)(x + 2)]/(x - 2).\n\nNow, I see that (x - 2) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. As long as x \u2260 2, I can cancel out these (x - 2) terms. So, f(x) simplifies to x + 2 for all x \u2260 2.\n\nThat's helpful because now the function is much simpler, and I can find the limit by plugging in x = 2 into this simplified function.\n\nSo, the limit as x approaches 2 of f(x) is the same as the limit as x approaches 2 of (x + 2).\n\nNow, plugging in x = 2: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the limit is 4.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure that this is indeed the case. Maybe I should check the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit to confirm that they both approach 4.\n\nFirst, the right-hand limit as x approaches 2 from the right (x > 2):\n\nLet's pick a value slightly greater than 2, say x = 2.1.\n\nf(2.1) = (2.1^2 - 4)/(2.1 - 2) = (4.41 - 4)/(0.1) = 0.41/0.1 = 4.1.\n\nNow, x = 2.01:\n\nf(2.01) = (2.01^2 - 4)/(2.01 - 2) = (4.0401 - 4)/(0.01) = 0.0401/0.01 = 4.01.\n\nAnd x = 2.001:\n\nf(2.001) = (2.001^2 - 4)/(2.001 - 2) = (4.004001 - 4)/(0.001) = 0.004001/0.001 = 4.001.\n\nSo, as x gets closer to 2 from the right, f(x) gets closer to 4.\n\nNow, the left-hand limit as x approaches 2 from the left (x < 2):\n\nLet's pick x = 1.9.\n\nf(1.9) = (1.9^2 - 4)/(1.9 - 2) = (3.61 - 4)/(-0.1) = (-0.39)/(-0.1) = 3.9.\n\nx = 1.99:\n\nf(1.99) = (1.99^2 - 4)/(1.99 - 2) = (3.9601 - 4)/(-0.01) = (-0.0399)/(-0.01) = 3.99.\n\nx = 1.999:\n\nf(1.999) = (1.999^2 - 4)/(1.999 - 2) = (3.996001 - 4)/(-0.001) = (-0.003999)/(-0.001) = 3.999.\n\nSo, as x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 4 as well.\n\nSince both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit approach 4, I can confidently say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 is 4.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can graph the function to visualize what's happening.\n\nLet me think about the graph of f(x) = (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2).\n\nFirst, for x \u2260 2, f(x) = x + 2, as we've simplified earlier.\n\nBut at x = 2, the original function is undefined because of division by zero.\n\nSo, the graph of f(x) is the same as the line y = x + 2, except at x = 2, where there's a hole.\n\nSo, visualizing that, as x gets closer to 2 from either side, y gets closer to 4, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use L'H\u00f4pital's Rule since direct substitution leads to 0/0, which is an indeterminate form.\n\nL'H\u00f4pital's Rule says that if the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches a is of the form 0/0 or \u221e/\u221e, then the limit is equal to the limit of f'(x)/g'(x) as x approaches a, assuming that limit exists.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 4, g(x) = x - 2.\n\nFind the derivatives:\n\nf'(x) = 2x, g'(x) = 1.\n\nSo, the limit as x approaches 2 of f'(x)/g'(x) = limit as x approaches 2 of 2x/1 = 2*(2)/1 = 4.\n\nAgain, I get 4.\n\nSo, multiple methods confirm that the limit is 4.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should note that while the limit exists and is equal to 4, the function itself is undefined at x = 2. So, the function has a removable discontinuity at x = 2.\n\nIn summary, the limit of f(x) = (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
