        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory produces 3000 widgets per day, and each widget costs $5 to make. They sell each widget for $12. We need to find out the profit after 15 days.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the daily cost of production. If each widget costs $5 and they make 3000 of them each day, then the daily cost is 3000 widgets times $5 per widget. That would be 3000 * 5 = $15,000 per day.\n\nNext, the revenue from selling these widgets. They sell each widget for $12, so the daily revenue is 3000 widgets times $12 per widget. That's 3000 * 12 = $36,000 per day.\n\nNow, the daily profit would be the revenue minus the cost, so $36,000 - $15,000 = $21,000 per day.\n\nFinally, to find the profit over 15 days, we multiply the daily profit by 15. So, $21,000 * 15.\n\nLet me calculate that: 21,000 times 15.\n\nWell, 20,000 times 15 is 300,000, and 1,000 times 15 is 15,000, so total profit would be $315,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nDaily cost: 3000 widgets * $5 = $15,000.\n\nDaily revenue: 3000 widgets * $12 = $36,000.\n\nDaily profit: $36,000 - $15,000 = $21,000.\n\nOver 15 days: $21,000 * 15 = $315,000.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of profit per widget.\n\nProfit per widget is selling price minus cost price, which is $12 - $5 = $7 per widget.\n\nDaily profit would then be $7 per widget times 3000 widgets, which is $21,000, same as before.\n\nOver 15 days, $21,000 * 15 = $315,000.\n\nSo, the factory makes a profit of $315,000 after 15 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{315000} \\]"
