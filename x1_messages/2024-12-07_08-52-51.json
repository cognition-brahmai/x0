        "content": "So David starts with 20 index cards, right? He puts them on the table. Lisa takes 5 for notes, so that leaves 15 cards on the table. While Lisa is away, Sam spills water on those 15 cards, making them unusable. Then, Sam goes and buys a new pack of 30 index cards. So, now, the group has these new 30 cards, but the original 15 are ruined.\n\nLet's think about what each member might think about the number of usable index cards.\n\nFirst, David. He originally brought 20 cards. He knows Lisa took 5, so he might have expected there to be 15 left. But since Sam spilled water on them, those 15 are no good. Sam then buys 30 new ones. So, David might think that now they have 30 usable cards, since the original 15 are ruined.\n\nNow, Lisa. She took 5 cards before the accident. She doesn't know about the spill until she comes back. So, from her perspective, she has 5 usable cards, and she might assume that the remaining 15 are still on the table. But when she returns, she'll see that the original cards are ruined and that Sam has bought 30 new ones. So, she might think that they now have 5 (hers) plus 30 (new ones), totaling 35 usable cards. But actually, her 5 are the only ones from the original stack that are usable, since Sam spilled water on the rest.\n\nLastly, Sam. He knows that he spilled water on the remaining 15 cards, making them unusable. He then bought 30 new ones. So, he might think that they have 30 usable cards from the new pack. He might not consider whether Lisa's 5 cards are still usable or not, especially if he didn't see her take them before the spill.\n\nWait a minute, does Sam know that Lisa took 5 cards before the spill? If he saw her take them, he might know that those 5 are still usable, separate from the spilled ones. But if he didn't notice, he might think that all the original 20 cards are ruined, except for the new 30.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to clarify that. Let's assume Sam saw Lisa take the 5 cards before the spill. So, he knows that those 5 are untouched and usable, and the remaining 15 were spilled on. Then, he buys 30 new ones.\n\nIn that case, Sam would probably think that they have the original 5 cards Lisa took plus the 30 new ones, totaling 35 usable cards.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- David might think they have 30 usable cards (new pack).\n\n- Lisa might think they have 35 usable cards (her 5 plus new 30).\n\n- Sam also thinks they have 35 usable cards (Lisa's 5 plus new 30).\n\nBut actually, the situation is that there are 35 usable cards: Lisa's 5 original cards plus the 30 new ones, assuming her cards weren't affected by the spill.\n\nWait, but the spill only happened to the cards on the table, which were the remaining 15 after Lisa took her 5. So, Lisa's 5 cards are still usable, as are the new 30 cards Sam bought. So, total usable cards are indeed 35.\n\nUnless... unless the spill somehow affected the entire area, but the scenario says Sam spilled water on the remaining index cards, meaning the 15 on the table, not necessarily on Lisa's cards if she took them with her or placed them elsewhere.\n\nSo, yes, it's safe to say that Lisa's 5 cards are usable, the 15 on the table are ruined, and Sam bought 30 new ones, making 35 usable cards in total.\n\nTherefore, all three members would probably think there are 35 usable cards, assuming they are all on the same page about what happened.\n\nBut maybe there's a chance that David only knows about the new 30 cards and isn't aware that Lisa had set aside her 5 cards before the spill. In that case, David might think there are only 30 usable cards.\n\nAlternatively, if David saw Lisa take the 5 cards before the spill, he would know that those are still usable in addition to the new 30, totaling 35.\n\nGiven that, perhaps their thoughts depend on what they observed or were told.\n\nLet me try to outline their possible thoughts more clearly.\n\nDavid:\n\n- Brought 20 cards.\n\n- Knew Lisa took 5.\n\n- Saw Sam spill water on the remaining 15.\n\n- Saw Sam buy 30 new cards.\n\n- Therefore, he knows the original 15 are ruined, but Lisa's 5 might be okay if they weren't spilled on.\n\n- So, David might think: \"We have Lisa's 5 cards plus the new 30, so 35 usable cards.\"\n\nLisa:\n\n- Took 5 cards before the spill.\n\n- Left the room.\n\n- When she returns, she sees the new pack of 30 cards.\n\n- Assumes her 5 cards are still usable.\n\n- Therefore, she might think: \"I have my 5 cards, and Sam bought 30 more, so we have 35 usable cards.\"\n\nSam:\n\n- Saw Lisa take 5 cards.\n\n- Spilled water on the remaining 15.\n\n- Bought 30 new cards.\n\n- Knows that the original 15 are ruined, but Lisa's 5 were not spilled on.\n\n- Therefore, he might think: \"We have Lisa's 5 cards plus the new 30, totaling 35 usable cards.\"\n\nSo, all three likely conclude that there are 35 usable index cards available for the group project.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
