        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car rental company charges $20 per day for renting a car, and also 15 cents for each mile driven. The customer is renting the car for 3 days and driving it for 150 miles. I need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for renting the car for 3 days. Since it's $20 per day, I can multiply 20 by 3.\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\nSo, the rental cost is $60.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 150 miles. The charge is 15 cents per mile. So, I'll multiply 150 by 0.15.\n\n150 * 0.15 = 22.5\n\nSo, the mileage cost is $22.50.\n\nNow, I'll add the rental cost and the mileage cost to get the total cost.\n\n60 + 22.5 = 82.5\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $82.50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps they offer any discounts or include certain miles for free. But based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total cost formula, which would be:\n\nTotal Cost = (Daily Rental Rate * Number of Days) + (Mileage Rate * Miles Driven)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal Cost = (20 * 3) + (0.15 * 150) = 60 + 22.5 = 82.5\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any additional fees, like tax or insurance, but the problem doesn't mention any extras. So, I'll assume that the only costs are the daily rental and the mileage.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total miles cost first and then add the rental days cost, but that should give the same result.\n\nSo, 0.15 * 150 = 22.5 for miles, and 20 * 3 = 60 for days, totaling 82.5.\n\nAlternatively, if the company has a different pricing model, like a fixed fee for the first day or something, but again, the problem states a straightforward daily rate plus mileage.\n\nI should also consider if the mileage cost is per mile or per kilometer, but since the problem specifies miles, and the rate is per mile, that's fine.\n\nWait, the problem says \"15 cents per mile driven,\" which is clear.\n\nSo, no need to convert units or anything.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $82.50.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{82.50} \\]"
