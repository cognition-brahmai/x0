        "content": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is:\n\n(4x + 6) / 2 = x - 3\n\nFirst, I'll simplify the left side of the equation. I can divide both terms in the numerator by 2.\n\nSo, (4x)/2 + 6/2 = 2x + 3\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n2x + 3 = x - 3\n\nNext, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. I'll subtract x from both sides:\n\n2x - x + 3 = x - x - 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx + 3 = -3\n\nNow, I'll subtract 3 from both sides to isolate x:\n\nx + 3 - 3 = -3 - 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = -6\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = -6.\n\nTo verify, I can plug this value back into the original equation:\n\n(4*(-6) + 6)/2 = (-6) - 3\n\nCalculating the left side:\n\n(-24 + 6)/2 = (-18)/2 = -9\n\nRight side:\n\n-6 - 3 = -9\n\nSince both sides equal -9, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-6} \\]"
