        "content": "So the factory produces 1500 items every day, and each item has a 1.5% chance of being defective. We need to find out how many defective items are produced in a month with 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 1.5% defect rate means. If each item has a 1.5% chance of being defective, that means for every 100 items, 1.5 are defective. But since we can't have half a defective item, I'll need to handle the percentages properly.\n\nLet me calculate the number of defective items produced per day. If the factory produces 1500 items daily and each has a 1.5% defect rate, the number of defective items per day would be 1500 multiplied by 1.5%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky. To multiply by a percentage, I should convert the percentage to a decimal. So, 1.5% is equal to 1.5 divided by 100, which is 0.015.\n\nSo, defective items per day = 1500 * 0.015.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 1500 times 0.015.\n\nFirst, 1500 times 15 is 22,500. Then, since 0.015 has three decimal places, but 15 has no decimal places. Wait, 0.015 has three decimal places, so 1500 * 0.015 should have three decimal places, but 1500 is a whole number.\n\nWait, actually, 1500 has no decimal places, and 0.015 has three decimal places, so the product should have three decimal places.\n\nBut 1500 * 0.015:\n\n1500 * 0.01 = 1500 * 0.01 = 15.\n\nAnd 1500 * 0.005 = 7.5.\n\nSo, 15 + 7.5 = 22.5.\n\nTherefore, defective items per day are 22.5.\n\nBut we can't have half a defective item, but in statistics, especially when dealing with rates, it's possible to have fractions.\n\nNow, to find out the monthly defective items, I need to multiply the daily defective items by the number of days in the month.\n\nGiven that the month has 30 days, so:\n\nDefective items per month = 22.5 * 30.\n\nLet's calculate that: 22.5 times 30.\n\n22 times 30 is 660, and 0.5 times 30 is 15, so total 660 + 15 = 675.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 675 defective items in a month with 30 days.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, daily production: 1500 items.\n\nDefect rate: 1.5%, which is 0.015 in decimal form.\n\nDefective items per day: 1500 * 0.015 = 22.5.\n\nNumber of days: 30.\n\nTotal defective items: 22.5 * 30 = 675.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total production in a month and then apply the defect rate.\n\nTotal monthly production: 1500 items/day * 30 days = 45,000 items.\n\nDefective items: 45,000 * 0.015.\n\nLet me calculate that: 45,000 * 0.015.\n\nFirst, 45,000 * 0.01 = 450.\n\nThen, 45,000 * 0.005 = 225.\n\nSo, 450 + 225 = 675.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 675 defective items in a month with 30 days.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{675} \\]"
