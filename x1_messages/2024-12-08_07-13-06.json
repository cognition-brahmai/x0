        "content": "So in this town, there are 3 doctors and 2 dentists. Each doctor has 4 patients, and each dentist has 5 patients. We need to find out how many patients there are in total.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many patients the doctors have. There are 3 doctors, and each has 4 patients. So, if we multiply the number of doctors by the number of patients per doctor, we get:\n\n3 doctors * 4 patients/doct or = 12 patients\n\nOkay, so the doctors have 12 patients in total.\n\nNext, let's look at the dentists. There are 2 dentists, and each has 5 patients. So, multiplying the number of dentists by the number of patients per dentist:\n\n2 dentists * 5 patients/dentist = 10 patients\n\nSo, the dentists have 10 patients in total.\n\nNow, to find the total number of patients that both doctors and dentists have, we need to add these two numbers together:\n\n12 patients (from doctors) + 10 patients (from dentists) = 22 patients\n\nTherefore, there are 22 patients in total.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm thinking, maybe some patients go to both a doctor and a dentist. Shouldn't we consider if there's any overlap in patients?\n\nBut in the problem, it doesn't say anything about patients going to both a doctor and a dentist. It just says each doctor has 4 patients and each dentist has 5 patients. So, probably, we can assume that these patients are distinct, unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, based on that, the total number of patients is 22.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there is any possible overlap.\n\nIf some patients are seeing both a doctor and a dentist, then the total number of unique patients would be less than 22.\n\nHowever, without specific information about overlap, the safest assumption is that the patients are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients is 22.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to consider the possibility of overlap, we would need more information, like how many patients see both a doctor and a dentist.\n\nBut since no such information is provided, we'll stick with the assumption of distinct patients.\n\nSo, the final answer is 22 patients.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
