        "content": "A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion on a particular issue derived from Islamic law, or Sharia. It is issued by an Islamic scholar or a body of scholars, often in response to a specific question or situation. Fatwas are meant to guide Muslims in their understanding and practice of Islam, but they are not universally binding and can vary depending on the school of thought and the interpretation of the scholar issuing them."
