        "content": "Certainly! Here's a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a non-negative integer as an argument. For example, `factorial(5)` will return 120, since 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nRecursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. In this case, the factorial of n is calculated as n multiplied by the factorial of (n-1), with the base case being that the factorial of 0 or 1 is 1.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
