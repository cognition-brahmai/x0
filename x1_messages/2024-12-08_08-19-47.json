        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. Let's see what it's asking. The tank has a diameter of 3 meters and a height of 5 meters, and it's filled to 80% capacity. I need to find out how much water it contains, and I should use \u03c0 approximately equal to 3.14.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder. I think it's volume equals \u03c0 times the radius squared times the height. Yes, that sounds right. So, V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nNow, the diameter is given as 3 meters, so the radius is half of that, which is 1.5 meters. Got it.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, V = 3.14 \u00d7 (1.5)\u00b2 \u00d7 5.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the radius squared: 1.5 squared is 2.25.\n\nThen, multiply that by \u03c0: 3.14 \u00d7 2.25 = 7.065.\n\nFinally, multiply by the height: 7.065 \u00d7 5 = 35.325 cubic meters.\n\nWait, but the tank is only filled to 80% capacity. So, I need to find 80% of the total volume.\n\nSo, 80% of 35.325 is 0.8 \u00d7 35.325.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.8 \u00d7 35.325 = 28.26 cubic meters.\n\nTherefore, the tank contains 28.26 cubic meters of water.\n\nBut, you know, I'm a bit unsure about the units. Is cubic meters the correct unit for volume of water? I think so, but sometimes people use liters as well. Maybe I should convert it to liters.\n\nWait, 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters. So, 28.26 cubic meters would be 28.26 \u00d7 1000 = 28,260 liters.\n\nHmm, but the problem didn't specify the unit, so maybe cubic meters is fine. Probably, since the dimensions were given in meters.\n\nLet me check if I did everything correctly. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is indeed V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. I correctly found the radius by dividing the diameter by 2. My calculations seem accurate: 1.5 squared is 2.25, times 3.14 is 7.065, times 5 is 35.325. Then, 80% of that is 28.26.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can double-check the calculations.\n\nLet me calculate \u03c0r\u00b2 again: 3.14 \u00d7 2.25 = 7.065. Yes.\n\nThen, times height: 7.065 \u00d7 5 = 35.325. Correct.\n\n80% of 35.325: 0.8 \u00d7 35.325 = 28.26. Yep.\n\nSo, the tank contains 28.26 cubic meters of water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28.26} \\]"
