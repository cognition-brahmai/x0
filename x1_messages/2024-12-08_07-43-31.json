        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this program that uses recursion to sort an array of integers. It splits the array into two halves repeatedly until it gets arrays of size one, and then it combines these sorted halves back together. This process keeps going until the whole array is sorted. I need to figure out which sorting algorithm this describes among the options: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort.\n\nFirst, I should recall how each of these sorting algorithms works.\n\nBubble Sort: It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order. This process repeats until the list is sorted. It doesn't use recursion.\n\nInsertion Sort: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the list, and for each element, it finds the correct position in the already sorted part of the list and inserts it there. Also, no recursion involved here.\n\nQuick Sort: It uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. Then, it recursively sorts the sub-arrays. So, it does use recursion, and it divides the array into parts.\n\nMerge Sort: It also uses divide and conquer. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there's only one sublist remaining, which is the sorted list. This sounds a lot like what's described in the problem.\n\nNow, comparing the description to these algorithms:\n\nThe program splits the array into two halves until it reaches arrays of size one, which is exactly what Merge Sort does. Then, it combines these sorted halves back together, which is the merge step in Merge Sort.\n\nQuick Sort also uses recursion and divides the array, but it partitions the array based on a pivot, not necessarily into equal halves. And the combining step in Quick Sort is implicit in the way it recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n\nBubble Sort and Insertion Sort don't use recursion and work differently altogether.\n\nSo, the description best matches Merge Sort.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Does Merge Sort always split into exactly two halves, or does it just divide into subarrays?\n\nActually, Merge Sort generally splits the array into two halves at each step, but the key point is that it divides the problem into smaller subproblems and then combines them.\n\nIn this description, it specifically says it splits into two halves, which is consistent with Merge Sort.\n\nQuick Sort can also be considered a divide-and-conquer algorithm, but its division is based on the pivot, not necessarily on splitting into halves.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Merge Sort.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any variant of Quick Sort or other algorithms that might fit this description.\n\nWell, there's something called Binary Insertion Sort, which uses binary search to find the proper location to insert the selected item at each iteration. However, it's still an insertion sort and doesn't use recursion in the same way as described.\n\nAnother algorithm that comes to mind is Heap Sort, but it doesn't use recursion in the way described. It builds a heap and then sorts the elements by repeatedly removing the root element.\n\nSo, after considering these options, I'm confident that the description best represents Merge Sort.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
