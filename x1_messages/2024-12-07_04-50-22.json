        "content": "So the train is going from City A to City B, and the total distance is 200 miles. It's traveling at a constant speed, which is good because that makes things easier to figure out. Now, it takes the train 2 hours to travel halfway between the cities. Halfway would be 100 miles, right? Because 200 miles divided by 2 is 100 miles.\n\nSo, if it takes 2 hours to cover 100 miles, we can calculate the speed of the train. Speed is distance divided by time, right? So, 100 miles divided by 2 hours equals 50 miles per hour. That's the speed of the train.\n\nNow, since the train is traveling at a constant speed, we can use this speed to find out how long it will take to cover the remaining 100 miles to reach City B.\n\nAgain, time is distance divided by speed. So, for the remaining 100 miles, time equals 100 miles divided by 50 miles per hour, which is 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time to reach City B from City A is the time to cover the first half plus the time to cover the second half, which is 2 hours plus 2 hours, equaling 4 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Let's see. If the train is traveling at a constant speed, and it takes 2 hours to cover the first 100 miles, it should take the same amount of time to cover the next 100 miles, assuming the speed remains unchanged. So, again, that's 2 hours plus 2 hours, totaling 4 hours.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider the entire journey. The total distance is 200 miles, and the speed is 50 miles per hour. So, time equals distance divided by speed, which is 200 miles divided by 50 miles per hour, which also gives us 4 hours.\n\nHmm, all these methods lead to the same conclusion. So, it seems consistent.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. The problem says the train travels at a constant speed, which is key. If the speed was changing, it would be more complicated, but since it's constant, our calculations should hold.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that it takes 2 hours to travel halfway, which is 100 miles, and we've determined the speed is 50 miles per hour. If we consider the entire journey of 200 miles at 50 miles per hour, it should indeed take 4 hours.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose we plot a graph of distance versus time. Since the speed is constant, the graph would be a straight line. At time equals 0, the train is at City A, which is 0 miles. At time equals 2 hours, it's at 100 miles. So, the slope of the line, which represents speed, is 50 miles per hour.\n\nTo find out when the train reaches City B, which is 200 miles, we can extend this line. So, at what time does the distance equal 200 miles? Well, time equals distance divided by speed, which is 200 miles divided by 50 miles per hour, which is 4 hours.\n\nAlternatively, since it takes 2 hours to cover 100 miles, to cover twice the distance, it should take twice the time, which is 4 hours.\n\nEverything seems to confirm that the total time to reach City B is 4 hours.\n\nIs there any other aspect to consider? Maybe the train's acceleration or something, but the problem states that it travels at a constant speed, so no acceleration is involved.\n\nAlso, we're not given any information about stops or delays, so we can assume the train travels continuously at 50 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
