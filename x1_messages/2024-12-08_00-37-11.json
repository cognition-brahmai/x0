        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the baker uses 3 eggs to make 2 cakes, and we need to find out how many eggs she'll need to make 50 cakes. Hmm, this seems like a proportion problem, right?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cakes. The problem says that 3 eggs are used for 2 cakes. So, for every 2 cakes, there are 3 eggs. I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 50 cakes.\n\nMaybe I can set up a proportion to solve this. In math, proportions are useful when two ratios are equal. So, the ratio of eggs to cakes should be the same in both cases.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n3 eggs / 2 cakes = x eggs / 50 cakes\n\nSo, 3/2 = x/50\n\nNow, I need to solve for x, which represents the number of eggs needed for 50 cakes.\n\nTo solve this proportion, I can cross-multiply:\n\n3 * 50 = 2 * x\n\nThat gives me:\n\n150 = 2x\n\nNow, to find x, I need to divide both sides by 2:\n\n150 / 2 = x\n\nSo, x = 75\n\nTherefore, the baker will need 75 eggs to make 50 cakes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way is to find out how many eggs are needed for one cake and then multiply that by 50.\n\nFrom the original information, 3 eggs make 2 cakes. So, for one cake, the number of eggs would be 3/2 = 1.5 eggs per cake.\n\nThen, for 50 cakes, it would be 1.5 * 50 = 75 eggs.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of multiples. If 2 cakes require 3 eggs, then how many times does 2 go into 50? 50 divided by 2 is 25. So, she needs 25 times the amount of eggs required for 2 cakes.\n\n25 * 3 = 75 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe the relationship isn't directly proportional. For example, perhaps there are fixed eggs used regardless of the number of cakes, but no, the problem suggests a directly proportional relationship.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any restrictions or constraints, like the baker can only use whole eggs, but since 1.5 eggs per cake seems feasible in baking (maybe by splitting eggs), and the problem doesn't specify otherwise, I think 75 eggs is acceptable.\n\nAlso, I should consider units. Eggs are being used to make cakes, and the relationship is given in terms of eggs per cakes, so my final answer should be in eggs.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me plug my answer back into the original ratio to ensure it makes sense.\n\nIf 3 eggs make 2 cakes, then 75 eggs should make how many cakes?\n\nUsing the same ratio: 3/2 = 75/x\n\nSolving for x: 3x = 150 => x = 50 cakes.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 75 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
