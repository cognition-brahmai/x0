        "content": "Is this a riddle? It sounds like one. Let me think about it. So, what always runs but never walks, often murmurs but never talks, has a bed but never sleeps, and has a mouth but never eats?\n\nAlright, let's break it down piece by piece.\n\nFirst, \"always runs but never walks.\" What runs but doesn't walk? Well, a river or a stream always flows, which is a kind of running, but it doesn't walk.\n\nOkay, that fits. Now, \"often murmurs but never talks.\" Again, a river or stream might make murmuring sounds as the water flows, but it doesn't talk.\n\nNext, \"has a bed but never sleeps.\" A river does have a bed\u2014the riverbed\u2014but it doesn't sleep. That makes sense.\n\nLastly, \"has a mouth but never eats.\" A river has a mouth where it flows into another body of water, like an ocean or a lake, but it doesn't eat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like the answer is a river or a stream.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there anything else that could fit this description?\n\nWell, another possibility could be a road. A road runs but doesn't walk, but it doesn't really murmur or talk. It has a bed, which is the road surface, but it doesn't sleep. And it has a mouth, perhaps where it starts, but that doesn't really fit with \"never eats.\" So, that doesn't seem to fit as well as a river.\n\nWhat about time? Time always runs but never walks, it can murmur but never talks, it has a bed in the sense of a timepiece, but it doesn't sleep, and it has a mouth like the mouth of a river, but that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nNo, I think a river is the most fitting answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{river}} \\]"
