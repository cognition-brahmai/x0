        "content": "So I've got this math problem here: (4^2 - 3) / (2 + 7) * 6. I need to solve this step by step, making sure I follow the correct order of operations. I remember that in math, there's a specific order to do operations called PEMDAS or BODMAS or something like that. Let me recall: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo first, I look at the parentheses because those have the highest priority. There are two sets here: (4^2 - 3) and (2 + 7). I need to solve what's inside each set of parentheses first.\n\nStarting with the first one: (4^2 - 3). Inside here, I have an exponent and a subtraction. Exponents come before subtraction, so I'll calculate 4^2 first.\n\n4^2 means 4 multiplied by itself, which is 16. So, 4^2 = 16.\n\nNow, subtract 3 from that: 16 - 3 = 13.\n\nSo, the first parentheses simplifies to 13.\n\nNext, the second set of parentheses: (2 + 7). That's straightforward: 2 + 7 = 9.\n\nNow, the expression has simplified to: 13 / 9 * 6.\n\nNext, I need to handle the division and multiplication. According to the order of operations, multiplication and division have the same precedence and should be done from left to right.\n\nSo, first, I'll do 13 divided by 9.\n\n13 divided by 9 is approximately 1.444... (repeating). Maybe I'll keep it as a fraction for more precision. 13/9.\n\nThen, I need to multiply that by 6: (13/9) * 6.\n\nTo multiply a fraction by a whole number, I can think of the whole number as a fraction with denominator 1. So, 6 is 6/1.\n\nNow, multiplying fractions: (13/9) * (6/1) = (13 * 6) / (9 * 1) = 78 / 9.\n\nNow, I can simplify 78/9. Both 78 and 9 are divisible by 3.\n\n78 divided by 3 is 26, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, 78/9 simplifies to 26/3.\n\n26/3 is approximately 8.666... (repeating), or it can be left as an improper fraction or converted to a mixed number.\n\nAs a mixed number, 26/3 is 8 and 2/3, because 3 goes into 26 eight times with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, the final answer is 26/3 or 8 and 2/3 or approximately 8.667.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n(4^2 - 3) / (2 + 7) * 6\n\nFirst, parentheses:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n16 - 3 = 13\n\n2 + 7 = 9\n\nSo, 13 / 9 * 6\n\nNow, division and multiplication from left to right:\n\n13 divided by 9 is 13/9\n\nThen, 13/9 multiplied by 6 is 13/9 * 6/1 = 78/9\n\nSimplify 78/9 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 26/3\n\nSo, yes, 26/3 is the exact answer, which is approximately 8.666..., or 8 and 2/3.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{26}{3}} \\]"
