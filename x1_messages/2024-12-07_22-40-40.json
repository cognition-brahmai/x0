        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a basket with only red and blue balls, and when you pick two balls at random without putting them back, there's a 1 in 3 chance that both are red. We need to find the ratio of red balls to blue balls.\n\nFirst, let's think about what's being asked. We need a ratio, which means we're looking for how many red balls there are compared to blue balls, not necessarily the exact numbers. So, maybe we can represent the number of red balls as r and the number of blue balls as b, and then find r/b.\n\nNow, the probability of picking two red balls without replacement is given as 1/3. To express this mathematically, we can use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are picking two red balls, and the total possible outcomes are picking any two balls from the basket.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick two balls from the basket is the combination of (r + b) balls taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to pick two balls is C(r + b, 2).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick two red balls is C(r, 2).\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls is:\n\nP = C(r, 2) / C(r + b, 2) = 1/3\n\nNow, let's write down the combination formulas:\n\nC(r, 2) = r! / (2!(r - 2)!) = (r(r - 1))/2\n\nC(r + b, 2) = (r + b)! / (2!(r + b - 2)!) = (r + b)(r + b - 1)/2\n\nSo, the probability becomes:\n\nP = [ (r(r - 1))/2 ] / [ (r + b)(r + b - 1)/2 ] = 1/3\n\nThe 2's cancel out, so:\n\nP = [ r(r - 1) ] / [ (r + b)(r + b - 1) ] = 1/3\n\nNow, we can set this equal to 1/3:\n\nr(r - 1) / [(r + b)(r + b - 1)] = 1/3\n\nOur goal is to solve for r/b.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky because we have two variables, r and b. Maybe we can express everything in terms of one variable. Let's consider expressing b in terms of r, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume a specific number of balls and solve from there, but since we're dealing with ratios, it's better to keep it in terms of r and b.\n\nLet's cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction:\n\n3 * r(r - 1) = (r + b)(r + b - 1)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: 3r(r - 1) = 3r^2 - 3r\n\nRight side: (r + b)(r + b - 1) = (r + b)^2 - (r + b) = r^2 + 2rb + b^2 - r - b\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n3r^2 - 3r = r^2 + 2rb + b^2 - r - b\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\n3r^2 - 3r - r^2 - 2rb - b^2 + r + b = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(3r^2 - r^2) + (-3r + r) - 2rb - b^2 + b = 0\n\n2r^2 - 2r - 2rb - b^2 + b = 0\n\nThis looks complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the ratio r/b = k, where k is the ratio we're trying to find.\n\nThen, r = k*b\n\nSubstitute r = k*b into the equation:\n\n3*(k*b)(k*b - 1) = (k*b + b)(k*b + b - 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n3*k*b*(k*b - 1) = (b(k + 1))(b(k + 1 - 1/b))\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider the total number of balls as n = r + b\n\nThen, the probability becomes:\n\nP = [ C(r, 2) ] / [ C(n, 2) ] = 1/3\n\nWe know that C(r, 2) = r(r - 1)/2\n\nAnd C(n, 2) = n(n - 1)/2\n\nSo, P = [r(r - 1)/2] / [n(n - 1)/2] = r(r - 1)/n(n - 1) = 1/3\n\nTherefore:\n\nr(r - 1)/n(n - 1) = 1/3\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n3r(r - 1) = n(n - 1)\n\nBut n = r + b, so:\n\n3r(r - 1) = (r + b)(r + b - 1)\n\nThis is the same equation as before. It seems we're back to the same point.\n\nMaybe we can consider that n is a multiple of r, or look for integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume that the number of blue balls is a certain value and solve for r.\n\nWait, maybe we can think in terms of the ratio directly.\n\nLet\u2019s set r/b = k, so r = k*b\n\nThen, n = r + b = k*b + b = b(k + 1)\n\nNow, substitute r = k*b and n = b(k + 1) into the probability equation:\n\nP = r(r - 1)/n(n - 1) = 1/3\n\nSo:\n\n[k*b*(k*b - 1)] / [b(k + 1)*(b(k + 1) - 1)] = 1/3\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: k*b*(k*b - 1) = k*b*(k*b) - k*b = k^2*b^2 - k*b\n\nDenominator: b(k + 1)*(b(k + 1) - 1) = b(k + 1)*(b*k + b - 1) = b(k + 1)*(b*k + (b - 1))\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to simplify.\n\nLet\u2019s expand the denominator:\n\nb(k + 1)*(b(k + 1) - 1) = b(k + 1)*(b*k + b - 1) = b(k + 1)*b(k + 1 - 1/b)\n\nThis doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I should expand it differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's expand both numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: k*b*(k*b - 1) = k*b*k*b - k*b = k^2*b^2 - k*b\n\nDenominator: b(k + 1)*(b(k + 1) - 1) = b(k + 1)*(b*k + b - 1) = b(k + 1)*b(k + 1 - 1/b)\n\nStill messy. Perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nWait, maybe express the equation in terms of k and b, and then solve for k.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n3*(k^2*b^2 - k*b) = (b(k + 1))*(b(k + 1) - 1)\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(b(k + 1))*(b(k + 1) - 1) = b(k + 1)*b(k + 1) - b(k + 1) = b^2(k + 1)^2 - b(k + 1)\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n3(k^2*b^2 - k*b) = b^2(k + 1)^2 - b(k + 1)\n\nLet's expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: 3k^2*b^2 - 3k*b\n\nRight side: b^2(k^2 + 2k + 1) - b(k + 1) = b^2*k^2 + 2b^2*k + b^2 - b*k - b\n\nSet them equal:\n\n3k^2*b^2 - 3k*b = b^2*k^2 + 2b^2*k + b^2 - b*k - b\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3k^2*b^2 - 3k*b - b^2*k^2 - 2b^2*k - b^2 + b*k + b = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3k^2*b^2 - b^2*k^2) + (-3k*b + b*k) - 2b^2*k - b^2 + b = 0\n\n(3k^2 - k^2*b^2) + (-3k + k)*b - 2b^2*k - b^2 + b = 0\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Maybe I need to factor differently.\n\nAlternatively, factor out b:\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n3k^2*b^2 - 3k*b - b^2*k^2 - 2b^2*k - b^2 + b*k + b = 0\n\nFactor b:\n\nb*(3k^2*b - 3k - b*k^2 - 2b*k - b + k + 1) = 0\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nPerhaps instead of introducing k, I should consider specific values.\n\nAssume there are r red balls and b blue balls, with r + b = n.\n\nWe have:\n\nr(r - 1)/n(n - 1) = 1/3\n\nLet\u2019s cross-multiply:\n\n3r(r - 1) = n(n - 1)\n\nBut n = r + b, so:\n\n3r(r - 1) = (r + b)(r + b - 1)\n\nLet\u2019s expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: 3r^2 - 3r\n\nRight side: (r + b)(r + b - 1) = r(r + b - 1) + b(r + b - 1) = r^2 + r*b - r + b*r + b^2 - b = r^2 + 2r*b + b^2 - r - b\n\nSet them equal:\n\n3r^2 - 3r = r^2 + 2r*b + b^2 - r - b\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3r^2 - 3r - r^2 - 2r*b - b^2 + r + b = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n2r^2 - 2r - 2r*b - b^2 + b = 0\n\nThis still seems messy. Maybe I can rearrange terms:\n\n2r^2 - 2r*b - 2r - b^2 + b = 0\n\nFactor where possible:\n\n2r(r - b - 1) - b^2 + b = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe I need to consider that r and b are integers, since they represent counts of balls.\n\nPerhaps I can look for integer solutions that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet\u2019s consider small integer values for r and see if we can find corresponding b.\n\nStart with r = 1:\n\n2*(1)^2 - 2*(1)*b - 2*(1) - b^2 + b = 0\n\n2 - 2b - 2 - b^2 + b = 0\n\n-2b + b - b^2 = 0\n\n- b - b^2 = 0\n\nb(-1 - b) = 0\n\nSo, b = 0 or b = -1\n\nBut b can't be 0 or negative, so r = 1 is not possible.\n\nNext, r = 2:\n\n2*(2)^2 - 2*(2)*b - 2*(2) - b^2 + b = 0\n\n8 - 4b - 4 - b^2 + b = 0\n\n4 - 4b - b^2 + b = 0\n\n- b^2 - 3b + 4 = 0\n\nb^2 + 3b - 4 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nb = [-3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 16)] / 2 = [-3 \u00b1 5]/2\n\nb = (2)/2 = 1 or b = (-8)/2 = -4\n\nAgain, b can't be negative, so b = 1\n\nSo, r = 2, b = 1\n\nCheck the probability:\n\nC(2,2)/C(3,2) = 1/3, which matches.\n\nSo, the ratio is 2:1\n\nWait, is this the only solution?\n\nLet\u2019s try r = 3:\n\n2*(3)^2 - 2*(3)*b - 2*(3) - b^2 + b = 0\n\n18 - 6b - 6 - b^2 + b = 0\n\n12 - 6b - b^2 + b = 0\n\n- b^2 - 5b + 12 = 0\n\nb^2 + 5b - 12 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nb = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 + 48)] / 2 = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(73)] / 2\n\nNot an integer, so no solution here.\n\nNext, r = 4:\n\n2*(4)^2 - 2*(4)*b - 2*(4) - b^2 + b = 0\n\n32 - 8b - 8 - b^2 + b = 0\n\n24 - 8b - b^2 + b = 0\n\n- b^2 - 7b + 24 = 0\n\nb^2 + 7b - 24 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nb = [-7 \u00b1 sqrt(49 + 96)] / 2 = [-7 \u00b1 sqrt(145)] / 2\n\nNot an integer.\n\nSeems like r = 2, b = 1 is the only integer solution.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red to blue balls is 2:1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2:1} \\]"
