Here's one for you:\n\nWhy don't writers date?\n\nBecause they always have a lot of exes.\n\nWait, that might not be exclusively about famous authors. Let me think of a better one.\n\nHere's another one:\n\nWhy did Shakespeare break up with his girlfriend?\n\nBecause he heard she was texting someone else in iambic pentameter.\n\nHaha, that's a bit cheesy, but it works.\n\nOr how about this one?\n\nWhy did Ernest Hemingway stop writing?\n\nBecause he got tired of short sentences.\n\nI hope these jokes bring a smile to your face!"
