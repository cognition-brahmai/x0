        "content": "Let's see. There are 25 people going on the trip, and each car can hold 4 passengers. To find out how many cars they need to rent, I should divide the total number of people by the number of passengers each car can hold.\n\nSo, 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. But you can't rent a fraction of a car, right? So, they would need to rent 7 cars to accommodate everyone.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If 4 cars can hold 16 people (4 cars x 4 passengers each), and 5 cars can hold 20 people, but we have 25 people. So, 6 cars would hold 24 people, which leaves 1 person without a seat. Therefore, they need 7 cars in total.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is they need to rent 7 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
