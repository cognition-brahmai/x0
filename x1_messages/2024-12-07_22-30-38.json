        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 10 meters and a height of 5 meters, and it takes 8 hours to fill it completely. I need to find out the flow rate of the water in liters per minute. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the volume of the cylindrical tank. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height. The diameter is given as 10 meters, so the radius \\( r \\) is half of that, which is 5 meters. The height \\( h \\) is 5 meters. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times (5)^2 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 25 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 125 \\]\n\\[ V \\approx 392.7 \\, \\text{cubic meters} \\]\n\nSo, the volume of the tank is approximately 392.7 cubic meters.\n\nNext, I need to find out how long it takes to fill the tank. It's given that it takes 8 hours to fill it completely. I need to convert this time into minutes because the flow rate is to be found in liters per minute.\n\n\\[ 8 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 480 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nSo, it takes 480 minutes to fill the tank.\n\nNow, to find the flow rate in cubic meters per minute, I can divide the volume of the tank by the time it takes to fill it:\n\n\\[ \\text{Flow rate} = \\frac{392.7 \\, \\text{m}^3}{480 \\, \\text{minutes}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Flow rate} \\approx 0.818 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{minute} \\]\n\nBut the question asks for the flow rate in liters per minute. Since 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, I can convert the flow rate:\n\n\\[ 0.818 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{minute} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{liters/m}^3 = 818 \\, \\text{liters/minute} \\]\n\nTherefore, the flow rate of the water is approximately 818 liters per minute.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the volume of the cylinder:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\\[ r = 5 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\\[ h = 5 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 25 \\times 5 = 125\\pi \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\\[ V \\approx 392.7 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, converting 8 hours to minutes:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nCorrect.\n\nThen, flow rate in cubic meters per minute:\n\n\\[ \\frac{392.7}{480} \\approx 0.818 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{minute} \\]\n\nYes.\n\nConverting to liters per minute:\n\n\\[ 0.818 \\times 1000 = 818 \\, \\text{liters/minute} \\]\n\nLooks good.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 818 liters per minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{818 \\, \\text{liters per minute}} \\]"
