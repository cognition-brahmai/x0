To find out how many apples you have in total, you need to multiply the number of bags by the number of apples in each bag.\n\nHere's the logic step by step:\n\n1. Each bag contains 6 apples.\n\n2. You're buying 7 bags.\n\n3. So, total apples = number of bags \u00d7 apples per bag.\n\n4. Plugging in the numbers: total apples = 7 \u00d7 6.\n\n5. 7 times 6 is 42.\n\nTherefore, you have 42 apples in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
