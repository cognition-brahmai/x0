        "content": "So I've got this game here, and I need to figure out what the expected value is for playing it. Let's see what I've got:\n\nThere's a 1/3 chance of winning $30, a 1/6 chance of winning $60, and a 1/2 chance of losing $20. Okay, expected value is basically the average outcome if you play this game many times. So, I need to calculate the sum of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability.\n\nFirst, let's list out the probabilities and their corresponding outcomes:\n\n- Winning $30 with a probability of 1/3\n\n- Winning $60 with a probability of 1/6\n\n- Losing $20 with a probability of 1/2\n\nAlright, so the formula for expected value E is:\n\nE = (Probability of Outcome 1 * Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 * Outcome 2) + ... and so on for all outcomes.\n\nSo plugging in the values I have:\n\nE = (1/3 * 30) + (1/6 * 60) + (1/2 * (-20))\n\nWait, losing $20 would be a negative outcome, so I should put -20 there.\n\nLet me calculate each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 1/3 * 30\n\n1/3 of 30 is 10. So, 10.\n\nSecond term: 1/6 * 60\n\n1/6 of 60 is 10. So, another 10.\n\nThird term: 1/2 * (-20)\n\nHalf of -20 is -10.\n\nNow, add them all up: 10 + 10 + (-10) = 10.\n\nSo, the expected value is $10.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst term: 1/3 * 30 = 10\n\nSecond term: 1/6 * 60 = 10\n\nThird term: 1/2 * (-20) = -10\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 - 10 = 10\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of decimals to verify.\n\n1/3 is approximately 0.333, 1/6 is approximately 0.1667, and 1/2 is 0.5.\n\nSo, 0.333 * 30 = 9.99 (which is close to 10)\n\n0.1667 * 60 = 10\n\n0.5 * (-20) = -10\n\nAdding them up: 9.99 + 10 - 10 = 9.99, which is practically 10.\n\nSo, expected value is $10.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of fractions without decimals.\n\n1/3 * 30 = 30/3 = 10\n\n1/6 * 60 = 60/6 = 10\n\n1/2 * (-20) = -20/2 = -10\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 - 10 = 10\n\nSame result.\n\nWait, is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can find a common denominator for the probabilities to see if they add up correctly.\n\nThe denominators are 3, 6, and 2. The least common multiple is 6.\n\nSo, converting probabilities:\n\n1/3 = 2/6\n\n1/6 = 1/6\n\n1/2 = 3/6\n\nNow, check if they sum to 1: 2/6 + 1/6 + 3/6 = 6/6 = 1. Good, that's correct.\n\nNow, using these fractions:\n\n(2/6 * 30) + (1/6 * 60) + (3/6 * (-20))\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n2/6 * 30 = (2*30)/6 = 60/6 = 10\n\n1/6 * 60 = 60/6 = 10\n\n3/6 * (-20) = (3*(-20))/6 = (-60)/6 = -10\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 - 10 = 10\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the expected value in terms of weighted averages.\n\nThe outcomes are $30, $60, and -$20, with weights 1/3, 1/6, and 1/2 respectively.\n\nSo, it's a weighted average: (1/3)*30 + (1/6)*60 + (1/2)*(-20)\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it: perhaps find a common denominator and treat them as parts of the whole.\n\nWith a common denominator of 6:\n\n- Winning $30 occurs 2 times out of 6\n\n- Winning $60 occurs 1 time out of 6\n\n- Losing $20 occurs 3 times out of 6\n\nSo, over 6 games, total winnings would be:\n\n(2 * 30) + (1 * 60) + (3 * (-20)) = 60 + 60 - 60 = 60\n\nSo, average per game: 60 / 6 = 10\n\nAgain, $10.\n\nThis matches all my previous calculations.\n\nTherefore, the expected value for playing this game is $10.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
