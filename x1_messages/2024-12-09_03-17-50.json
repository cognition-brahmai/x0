The walls are adorned with yellowed photographs of famous musicians. A large, grand piano sits in the center, its keys covered in a thin layer of dust.\n\nEnter JAMESON, a once-famous pianist now in his late 40s, wearing worn-out clothes and looking dejected. He approaches the grand piano, runs his fingers over the keys, and sighs.\n\nJAMESON\n(whispering to himself)\nWhat happened to me?\n\nHe sits down and attempts to play a few notes, but his hands tremble, and the sounds are disjointed and off-key.\n\nJAMESON\n(frustrated)\nDamn it!\n\nHe slams his hands on the piano, causing dust to fly. Suddenly, there's a soft knock on the door.\n\nJAMESON\n(startled)\nWho's there?\n\nThe door creaks open, and a small figure pokes their head in. It's LUCAS, a 10-year-old boy with big, curious eyes and tattered clothes.\n\nLUCAS\nHi, mister. Is this place open?\n\nJAMESON\n(surprised)\nOpen? This isn't a store, kid. It's just an old studio.\n\nLUCAS\nI heard there's a piano here. Can I see it?\n\nJameson hesitates but then gestures towards the grand piano.\n\nJAMESON\nGo ahead.\n\nLucas walks over, his eyes wide with wonder. He runs his small hands over the keys, then looks up at Jameson.\n\nLUCAS\nCan you teach me how to play?\n\nJameson chuckles bitterly.\n\nJAMESON\nMe? Teach you? I can barely play myself.\n\nLucas looks at him innocently.\n\nLUCAS\nBut you must know how to play. You're here, right?\n\nJameson sighs, a mix of sadness and something else in his eyes.\n\nJAMESON\nI used to be a pianist, kid. One of the best. But that was before...\n\nBefore he can finish, Lucas starts pressing random keys, creating a chaotic melody.\n\nLUCAS\n(o\u5174\u594bly)\nThis is fun!\n\nJameson watches, a small smile tugging at his lips.\n\nJAMESON\nYou have a natural ear for music, kid.\n\nLucas stops playing and looks serious.\n\nLUCAS\nI wanna learn proper. Can you help me?\n\nJameson considers this, remembering his own passion for music and how it once defined him.\n\nJAMESON\nAlright, kid. I'll teach you, but you have to promise to practice every day.\n\nLucas nods vigorously.\n\nLUCAS\nI promise!\n\nJameson nods, a sense of purpose returning to his eyes.\n\nJAMESON\nGood. Let's start with the basics.\n\nAs Jameson begins to instruct Lucas, the room seems to brighten, and the dust particles dance in the sunlight streaming through the window.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n\n"
