        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 12 balls. I draw one ball, note its color, put it back, and then draw another ball. I need to find the probability that both balls drawn are of the same color.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since I'm putting the ball back each time, the draws are independent events. That means the outcome of the first draw doesn't affect the second draw.\n\nNow, there are two possibilities for the balls to be the same color: both red or both blue.\n\nI'll calculate the probability for each case separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, the probability that both balls are red.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/12.\n\nSince I'm putting it back, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is also 5/12.\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being red is (5/12) * (5/12) = 25/144.\n\nNext, the probability that both balls are blue.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue ball on the first draw is 7/12.\n\nSimilarly, since I'm putting it back, the probability of drawing a blue ball on the second draw is also 7/12.\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being blue is (7/12) * (7/12) = 49/144.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that both balls are the same color, I add the two probabilities together: 25/144 + 49/144 = 74/144.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2: 37/72.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls drawn are of the same color is 37/72.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total probability like this:\n\nThe probability of both balls being red or both being blue is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each individual event, since they're mutually exclusive.\n\nSo, P(both red) + P(both blue) = (5/12)^2 + (7/12)^2 = 25/144 + 49/144 = 74/144 = 37/72.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total number of ways to draw two balls with replacement, which is 12 * 12 = 144 possible outcomes.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to draw two red balls plus the number of ways to draw two blue balls.\n\nNumber of ways to draw two red balls: 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nNumber of ways to draw two blue balls: 7 * 7 = 49.\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 25 + 49 = 74.\n\nSo, probability is 74/144 = 37/72.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for probability of independent events.\n\nSince the draws are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nSo, P(both red) = P(red on first draw) * P(red on second draw) = 5/12 * 5/12.\n\nSimilarly, P(both blue) = 7/12 * 7/12.\n\nThen, P(both same color) = P(both red) + P(both blue) = 25/144 + 49/144 = 74/144 = 37/72.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this to confirm?\n\nMaybe by considering the probability that the second ball matches the first.\n\nFirst, draw the first ball. It can be either red or blue.\n\nThen, the probability that the second ball matches the first is the probability that if the first is red, the second is also red, or if the first is blue, the second is also blue.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\nP(second matches first) = P(first is red) * P(second is red | first is red) + P(first is blue) * P(second is blue | first is blue).\n\nSince the draws are independent, P(second is red | first is red) = P(second is red) = 5/12.\n\nSimilarly, P(second is blue | first is blue) = 7/12.\n\nSo, P(second matches first) = (5/12)*(5/12) + (7/12)*(7/12) = 25/144 + 49/144 = 74/144 = 37/72.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach.\n\nSuppose I think about it in terms of total probability.\n\nThe probability that both are the same color is 1 minus the probability that they are different colors.\n\nWait, but that might not directly help, because I still need to calculate the probability of different colors.\n\nLet's see:\n\nP(different colors) = P(first red and second blue) + P(first blue and second red).\n\nP(first red and second blue) = (5/12)*(7/12) = 35/144.\n\nP(first blue and second red) = (7/12)*(5/12) = 35/144.\n\nSo, P(different colors) = 35/144 + 35/144 = 70/144.\n\nThen, P(same color) = 1 - P(different colors) = 1 - 70/144 = 74/144 = 37/72.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nThis reinforces that 37/72 is correct.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, so I'm satisfied with the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{37}{72}} \\]"
