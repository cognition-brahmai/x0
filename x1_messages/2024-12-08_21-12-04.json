        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of products: product A and product B. Each day, it cranks out 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B. Now, product A has a defect rate of 2%, and product B has a defect rate of 5%. We need to find out the overall defect rate for both products combined.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a defect rate is. The defect rate is the percentage of units that are defective out of the total units produced. So, for product A, 2% of 500 units are defective, and for product B, 5% of 300 units are defective.\n\nLet me calculate the number of defective units for each product.\n\nFor product A:\n\nDefective units of A = 2% of 500\n\nTo calculate 2% of 500, I can multiply 500 by 0.02 (since 2% equals 0.02 in decimal form).\n\nDefective units of A = 500 * 0.02 = 10 units\n\nFor product B:\n\nDefective units of B = 5% of 300\n\nSimilarly, 5% is 0.05 in decimal form.\n\nDefective units of B = 300 * 0.05 = 15 units\n\nNow, to find the overall defect rate, I need to find the total number of defective units and divide it by the total number of units produced, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of defective units:\n\nTotal defective units = defective units of A + defective units of B\n\nTotal defective units = 10 + 15 = 25 units\n\nNext, find the total number of units produced:\n\nTotal units produced = units of A + units of B\n\nTotal units produced = 500 + 300 = 800 units\n\nNow, the overall defect rate is:\n\nOverall defect rate = (total defective units / total units produced) * 100\n\nPlug in the numbers:\n\nOverall defect rate = (25 / 800) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n25 divided by 800 is 0.03125\n\nThen, 0.03125 multiplied by 100 gives 3.125%\n\nSo, the overall defect rate for both products combined is 3.125%.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nDefective units of A: 2% of 500 = 10 units\n\nDefective units of B: 5% of 300 = 15 units\n\nTotal defective units: 10 + 15 = 25 units\n\nTotal units produced: 500 + 300 = 800 units\n\nOverall defect rate: (25 / 800) * 100 = 3.125%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of weighted averages, considering the production volumes of each product.\n\nThe defect rate for A is 2%, and for B is 5%. Since more units of A are produced than B, the overall defect rate should be closer to the defect rate of A.\n\nLet me verify using weighted averages.\n\nWeighted average defect rate = (defect rate of A * production of A + defect rate of B * production of B) / total production\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nWeighted average defect rate = (2% * 500 + 5% * 300) / 800\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n(0.02 * 500 + 0.05 * 300) / 800\n\nCalculate inside the numerator:\n\n(10 + 15) / 800 = 25 / 800 = 0.03125, or 3.125%\n\nSo, again, 3.125%.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the contribution of each product to the total defect rate.\n\nProduct A contributes 10 defective units out of 800 total units, which is 10/800 = 1.25%\n\nProduct B contributes 15 defective units out of 800 total units, which is 15/800 = 1.875%\n\nTotal defect rate: 1.25% + 1.875% = 3.125%\n\nSame result.\n\nI think it's clear now that the overall defect rate is 3.125%.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation.\n\nIs there any possibility that defects in one product affect the defects in the other product? For example, if resources are shared in a way that affecting defect rates. But based on the information given, it seems that the defect rates for each product are independent.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"per day,\" but since we're looking at a daily production rate and defect rates, and assuming these rates are constant, the time factor doesn't come into play here.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 3.125% is the correct overall defect rate for both products combined.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.125\\%} \\]"
