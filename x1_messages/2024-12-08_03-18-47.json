        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a garden and a walkway. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a rectangular garden that's 20 meters long and 15 meters wide. That means its area is length times width, so 20 times 15, which is 300 square meters. But I need to find the area of the walkway around it, which is 2 meters wide all around.\n\nSo, if the walkway is uniform around the garden, that means it adds 2 meters to each side of the garden. Wait, actually, since it's around all sides, it adds 2 meters to both sides of the length and both sides of the width. So overall, the length including the walkway would be 20 meters plus 2 meters on one side and 2 meters on the other side, so that's 20 + 4 = 24 meters. Similarly, the width would be 15 plus 2 on one side and 2 on the other, so 15 + 4 = 19 meters.\n\nNow, the total area including the garden and the walkway would be 24 meters by 19 meters, which is 24 times 19. Let me calculate that: 20 times 19 is 380, and 4 times 19 is 76, so total is 380 plus 76, which is 456 square meters.\n\nThe area of just the walkway would be the total area minus the area of the garden. So, 456 minus 300 is 156 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the garden is 20 by 15, and the walkway adds 2 meters on all sides, then yes, the total length is 24 meters and width is 19 meters. The area of that entire rectangle is 456 square meters. Subtracting the garden's 300 square meters should give me the walkway's area, which is 156 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the walkway as consisting of strips around the garden. There are two strips along the length and two along the width, plus the corners.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. The first method seems straightforward.\n\nAnother way to verify is to calculate the area of the walkway by considering it as a larger rectangle minus the garden itself. That's exactly what I did.\n\nSo, I think the area of the walkway is 156 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{156} \\]"
