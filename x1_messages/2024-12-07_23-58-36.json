        "content": "So the company wants a 25% profit margin on each product they sell, and it costs them $60 to produce one unit. I need to figure out what price they should set to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a profit margin is. Profit margin is basically how much profit you make per dollar of revenue. A 25% profit margin means that for every dollar the company makes in sales, $0.25 is profit.\n\nSo, profit margin is calculated as:\n\nProfit Margin = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Selling Price\n\nIn this case, the profit margin should be 25%, and the cost price is $60.\n\nLet me denote the selling price as P.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n0.25 = (P - 60) / P\n\nNow, I need to solve for P.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by P:\n\n0.25P = P - 60\n\nNow, subtract P from both sides:\n\n0.25P - P = -60\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-0.75P = -60\n\nNow, divide both sides by -0.75:\n\nP = -60 / -0.75\n\nP = 80\n\nSo, the company should sell each unit for $80 to achieve a 25% profit margin.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf the selling price is $80 and the cost is $60, then the profit is $20.\n\nSo, profit margin would be $20 / $80 = 0.25, which is 25%. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of another way to calculate selling price based on desired profit margin. Some people use the formula:\n\nSelling Price = Cost Price / (1 - Profit Margin)\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSelling Price = 60 / (1 - 0.25) = 60 / 0.75 = 80\n\nAgain, $80.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret profit margin.\n\nSometimes, people confuse profit margin with markup. Markup is the percentage increase over the cost price, whereas profit margin is the profit as a percentage of the selling price.\n\nIn this case, since the question specifies profit margin, I think the first method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a markup of 25%, then the selling price would be cost price plus 25% of cost price.\n\nSo, Selling Price = Cost Price + (Markup % * Cost Price) = 60 + (0.25 * 60) = 60 + 15 = $75\n\nBut that's different from what we calculated earlier.\n\nSo, if it were a 25% markup, the selling price would be $75, but since it's a 25% profit margin, it should be $80.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between markup and profit margin.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is $80.\n\nBut let's consider the definitions again to be sure.\n\nProfit Margin = Profit / Selling Price\n\nMarkup = Profit / Cost Price\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nProfit Margin = 25% = 0.25\n\nSo, Profit = 0.25 * Selling Price\n\nAlso, Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price\n\nTherefore, 0.25 * Selling Price = Selling Price - 60\n\nWhich is the same equation I started with.\n\nAlternatively, with markup:\n\nMarkup = Profit / Cost Price\n\nIf Markup is 25%, then Profit = 0.25 * 60 = 15\n\nTherefore, Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit = 60 + 15 = 75\n\nBut this is different from the profit margin calculation.\n\nSo, depending on whether it's profit margin or markup, the selling price changes.\n\nGiven that, I need to make sure which one is being asked in the question.\n\nThe question says \"profit margin of 25% on its products.\"\n\nSo, it's referring to profit margin, not markup.\n\nTherefore, the correct selling price is $80.\n\nBut to provide more context, perhaps the company should be aware of the difference between markup and profit margin.\n\nFor example, a 25% markup would result in a selling price of $75, but the profit margin would be:\n\nProfit Margin = 15 / 75 = 0.20 or 20%\n\nWhich is less than the desired 25%.\n\nWhereas, setting the selling price to $80 achieves the 25% profit margin.\n\nSo, it's crucial to use the correct formula based on whether it's markup or profit margin.\n\nGiven that, I think $80 is the correct selling price to achieve a 25% profit margin.\n\nBut let's do a quick check with the profit margin formula.\n\nProfit Margin = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Selling Price\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n(80 - 60) / 80 = 20 / 80 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if they mistakenly used markup instead of profit margin, setting the selling price to $75 would give them a profit margin of 20%, which is less than the target.\n\nTherefore, to achieve exactly 25% profit margin, they should sell each unit for $80.\n\nSo, the answer is $80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
