        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 800 students. Out of these, 45% participate in sports, and 30% participate in music. We need to find out what percentage of students don't participate in either activity.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how many students are participating in sports and music. Since we're dealing with percentages, it might be easier to work with the percentages directly rather than converting them to actual numbers of students.\n\nSo, 45% of students participate in sports, and 30% participate in music. If I add these two percentages together, I get 45% + 30% = 75%. That seems straightforward, but I'm a bit unsure because maybe some students are participating in both sports and music. If that's the case, then adding 45% and 30% would count those students twice, which isn't right.\n\nWait a minute, the problem doesn't mention anything about students participating in both activities. Maybe we can assume that there's no overlap, meaning no student participates in both sports and music. In that case, the total percentage of students participating in either sports or music would indeed be 75%.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider the possibility of overlapping participation. If some students are involved in both activities, then the total percentage participating in either activity would be less than 75%. The formula to calculate the total percentage participating in either activity, accounting for overlap, is:\n\nTotal percentage = percentage in sports + percentage in music - percentage in both.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide the percentage of students participating in both, maybe it's safe to assume that there's no overlap. Alternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the two groups are mutually exclusive.\n\nLet me think about it another way. If 45% are in sports and 30% are in music, and there's no information suggesting that any student is in both, then it's reasonable to assume that the two groups are separate. Therefore, 75% of students are involved in either sports or music.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of students who don't participate in either activity, I can subtract the percentage participating in sports or music from 100%. So, 100% - 75% = 25%. Therefore, 25% of students do not participate in either activity.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there's any possibility that students could be participating in both activities. If there are students who participate in both, then the total percentage participating in either activity would be less than 75%, which would increase the percentage of students not participating in either activity.\n\nFor example, if 10% of students participate in both sports and music, then the total percentage participating in either activity would be 45% + 30% - 10% = 65%. Then, the percentage not participating in either would be 100% - 65% = 35%.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide any information about students participating in both activities, I think the safest assumption is that there is no overlap, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the groups are mutually exclusive, meaning no student is in both sports and music. In that case, the calculation I did initially would be correct: 45% + 30% = 75%, and 100% - 75% = 25%.\n\nBut to be completely sure, maybe I should consider the maximum and minimum possible percentages of students not participating in either activity.\n\nThe maximum would occur if all students participating in music are also participating in sports, meaning there's complete overlap. In that case, the total percentage participating in either activity would be just 45% (since the 30% participating in music are already included in the 45% participating in sports). Therefore, the percentage not participating in either activity would be 100% - 45% = 55%.\n\nThe minimum would occur if there is no overlap between the two groups, meaning 45% + 30% = 75% participate in either activity, and 100% - 75% = 25% do not participate in either.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify any overlap, and without additional information, I think the standard approach is to assume no overlap unless stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students not participating in either activity is 25%.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion. According to this principle, the total percentage participating in either activity is equal to the sum of the percentages participating in each activity minus the percentage participating in both.\n\nMathematically, this is:\n\nTotal = A + B - A \u2229 B\n\nWhere A is the percentage participating in sports (45%), B is the percentage participating in music (30%), and A \u2229 B is the percentage participating in both.\n\nWithout knowing A \u2229 B, I can't calculate the exact total. However, if I assume A \u2229 B = 0%, then Total = 45% + 30% - 0% = 75%, and the percentage not participating in either is 25%.\n\nIf A \u2229 B is greater than 0%, then the total would be less than 75%, and the percentage not participating in either would be greater than 25%.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide information about A \u2229 B, and without making assumptions, I think the answer depends on this unknown overlap.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to assume no overlap, in which case the answer is 25%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me consider using sets. Let S be the set of students participating in sports, and M be the set of students participating in music.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- Total students = 800\n\n- |S| = 45% of 800 = 0.45 * 800 = 360 students\n\n- |M| = 30% of 800 = 0.30 * 800 = 240 students\n\nWe need to find the number of students who are not in S or M, which is the complement of S union M.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|S \u222a M| = |S| + |M| - |S \u2229 M|\n\nThen, the number of students not in S or M is:\n\nTotal students - |S \u222a M| = 800 - (|S| + |M| - |S \u2229 M|)\n\nBut again, without knowing |S \u2229 M|, I can't calculate this exactly.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that there is no overlap, meaning |S \u2229 M| = 0.\n\nIn that case:\n\n|S \u222a M| = 360 + 240 - 0 = 600 students\n\nThen, students not in S or M = 800 - 600 = 200 students\n\nTo find the percentage: (200 / 800) * 100% = 25%\n\nThis aligns with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if there is some overlap, say x students participate in both, then:\n\n|S \u222a M| = 360 + 240 - x = 600 - x\n\nStudents not in S or M = 800 - (600 - x) = 200 + x\n\nPercentage not participating in either = (200 + x)/800 * 100%\n\nWithout knowing x, this is as far as I can go.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't provide information about x, perhaps the answer is indeed 25%, assuming no overlap.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the problem is considering that participation in sports and music are independent events. If that's the case, then the percentage participating in both would be the product of the individual percentages: 45% * 30% = 13.5%.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption to make here.\n\nIf I assume that, then:\n\n|S \u2229 M| = 13.5% of 800 = 0.135 * 800 = 108 students\n\nThen, |S \u222a M| = 360 + 240 - 108 = 492 students\n\nStudents not in S or M = 800 - 492 = 308 students\n\nPercentage = (308 / 800) * 100% = 38.5%\n\nBut this seems too speculative, as the problem doesn't indicate that participation in sports and music are independent.\n\nMoreover, assuming independence might not be appropriate in this context, as students who participate in sports might be more or less likely to participate in music for various reasons.\n\nTherefore, I think the best approach is to assume no overlap unless stated otherwise.\n\nHence, the percentage of students not participating in either activity is 25%.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Assume no overlap: |S \u2229 M| = 0\n\n- |S \u222a M| = 360 + 240 - 0 = 600 students\n\n- Students not in S or M = 800 - 600 = 200 students\n\n- Percentage = (200 / 800) * 100% = 25%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\%} \\]"
