        "content": "So, the train is going at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, and you want to know how far it travels. Okay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, I remember that speed is basically how fast something is moving, and it's usually measured in miles per hour (mph) when we're talking about trains or cars. So, 60 mph means the train covers 60 miles in one hour.\n\nNow, if the train maintains this speed for 3 hours, I can probably find the total distance by multiplying the speed by the time. That makes sense because distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, the formula would be:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours\n\nWhen I multiply 60 by 3, I get 180. And since the units are miles per hour and hours, the hours cancel out, leaving me with miles.\n\nSo, the train travels 180 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If the train goes 60 miles in one hour, then in two hours it would go 120 miles, and in three hours, it would go 180 miles. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I imagine plotting the train's journey on a graph with time on one axis and distance on the other, the slope of the line would represent the speed. So, with a speed of 60 mph, after 3 hours, the distance would indeed be 180 miles.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like, is the train accelerating or decelerating? The problem says it's traveling at an average speed, so fluctuations in speed are already accounted for in that average. So, using the average speed should give me the correct total distance.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Here, both speed and time are in compatible units\u2014miles per hour and hours, respectively\u2014so no conversion is needed.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more mathematical way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for distance in uniformly moving objects. Yeah, for uniform motion, distance is indeed speed multiplied by time.\n\nAnother way is to think about it in terms of rates. If the train covers 60 miles each hour, then in 3 hours, it would cover 3 times that amount, which is 180 miles.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 180 miles.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the average speed changes over time, but the problem states it's traveling at an average speed of 60 mph for 3 hours. So, regardless of any speed variations, the average speed multiplied by time gives the total distance.\n\nTherefore, the train travels 180 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
