        "content": "Yes, there is water on Mars, but it's mainly in the form of ice. The Martian polar ice caps and subsurface layers contain water ice. Additionally, traces of water vapor can be found in Mars' thin atmosphere. In 2015, NASA confirmed the presence of seasonal flows of salty liquid water on some Martian slopes, but the amount is minimal compared to Earth's water resources."
