Every stage in your strategy should correlate with an evidence value, which represents the output of a function given an input string. This string might be the user's question, previous evidence values, or a blend of both.\n\nHere are the tools you can utilize:\nNetResearcher[input]: This tool enables the user to conduct a broad internet search for information. It's handy for locating websites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Retrieves the textual content from a specified website URL.\nHyperlinkGatherer[input]: Extracts URLs from a block of text, producing a list of links separated by newlines.\nDataQA[input]: An AI-powered question-answering tool capable of providing responses based on a specific text passage. The input needs to be a question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable, for instance, \"What is the GDP of Japan, given :evidence1:?\"\n\nInputs to these functions should be straightforward strings, devoid of quotation marks or \"+\" signs used to combine a string with an evidence variable, like DataQA[Who won the 2020 US Presidential Election, given :evidence3:?].\n\nEnsure that each plan step corresponds to exactly one evidence output.\n\nYour output should adhere to the following structure:\nPlan: [the initial action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [the function to invoke with the appropriate input parameter]\nPlan: [the subsequent action based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [the next function to call along with its input parameter, potentially referencing prior evidence, e.g., \"In light of :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Response: [:evidence[n]: containing the conclusive answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the Rosetta Stone and where is it currently located?"
