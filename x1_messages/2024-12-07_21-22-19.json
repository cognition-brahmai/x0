        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company has a total revenue of $1,000,000 per year. Their fixed costs are $300,000, and variable costs are 40% of the revenue. I need to find out what their annual profit is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit means. Profit is basically what's left after you subtract all your costs from your revenue. So, profit = revenue - total costs.\n\nNow, total costs consist of fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are those that don't change with the level of production or sales, like rent or salaries. Variable costs change with the level of activity, like raw materials.\n\nGiven that, I have:\n\n- Revenue = $1,000,000\n\n- Fixed costs = $300,000\n\n- Variable costs = 40% of revenue\n\nSo, first I need to calculate the variable costs. Since it's 40% of revenue:\n\nVariable costs = 40% of $1,000,000 = 0.40 * 1,000,000 = $400,000\n\nNow, total costs = fixed costs + variable costs = $300,000 + $400,000 = $700,000\n\nThen, profit = revenue - total costs = $1,000,000 - $700,000 = $300,000\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there are any other costs or factors I need to consider. The problem mentions only fixed and variable costs, so I think that's all.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes companies have other costs like semi-variable costs or operating costs, but in this problem, it's just fixed and variable costs.\n\nAlso, ensure that the percentages are applied correctly. Here, variable costs are explicitly said to be 40% of revenue, so $400,000 is correct.\n\nSo, annual profit is $300,000.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps the variable costs are not directly 40% of revenue, but of something else. No, the problem clearly states \"variable costs are 40% of the revenue.\"\n\nAlternatively, sometimes revenue might include taxes or other deductions, but in standard accounting, revenue is before deductions unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs include some elements that should not be included, but again, the problem states fixed costs are $300,000.\n\nSo, I think $300,000 is the correct annual profit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that variable costs might be 40% of something else, like cost of goods sold, but no, the problem says \"40% of the revenue.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding of what variable costs include, but according to the problem, it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a need to consider depreciation or other non-cash expenses, but since it's not mentioned, I assume they are already included in fixed or variable costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are interest expenses or taxes, but again, since they are not mentioned, I assume they are not applicable or already accounted for.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation:\n\nProfit = Revenue - (Fixed costs + Variable costs) = $1,000,000 - ($300,000 + $400,000) = $300,000\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300000} \\]"
