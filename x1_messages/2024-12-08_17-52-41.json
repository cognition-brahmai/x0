        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a supermarket trying to figure out the best price to sell a popular product. The product currently sells 1,000 units per week at $10 each, and the cost to make each unit is $6. So, the supermarket wants to know what price to set to maximize their profit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what profit is. Profit is basically the revenue minus the cost. Revenue is the income from sales, which is the price per unit times the number of units sold. Cost is the expense to produce those units, which is the cost per unit times the number of units sold.\n\nSo, profit = revenue - cost = (price per unit * quantity sold) - (cost per unit * quantity sold).\n\nI can factor out the quantity sold: profit = quantity * (price - cost).\n\nBut in this case, the quantity sold depends on the price. The market research says that for every $1 increase in price, sales decrease by 100 units per week, and for every $1 decrease, sales increase by 100 units per week.\n\nThat means there's a linear relationship between price and quantity sold. Let me try to express that mathematically.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- P = price per unit\n\n- Q = quantity sold per week\n\nFrom the given information:\n\nWhen P = $10, Q = 1,000 units.\n\nFor every $1 increase in P, Q decreases by 100.\n\nSimilarly, for every $1 decrease in P, Q increases by 100.\n\nSo, the relationship between P and Q is linear.\n\nI can express Q as a function of P:\n\nQ = a * P + b\n\nWhere a and b are constants I need to find.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of how Q changes with P.\n\nGiven that Q changes by -100 for every $1 increase in P, that means the slope of the Q vs. P graph is -100.\n\nSo, Q = m * P + c, where m = -100.\n\nSo, Q = -100 * P + c.\n\nNow, I need to find c. I know that when P = 10, Q = 1,000.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n1,000 = -100 * 10 + c\n\n1,000 = -1,000 + c\n\nSo, c = 1,000 + 1,000 = 2,000.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\nQ = -100 * P + 2,000.\n\nAlright, now I have the relationship between quantity sold and price.\n\nNext, I need to express profit in terms of P.\n\nProfit = revenue - cost\n\nRevenue = P * Q = P * (-100P + 2,000)\n\nCost = cost per unit * Q = 6 * (-100P + 2,000)\n\nTherefore, profit = P * (-100P + 2,000) - 6 * (-100P + 2,000)\n\nLet me simplify that.\n\nFirst, expand the revenue:\n\nP * (-100P + 2,000) = -100P^2 + 2,000P\n\nThen, expand the cost:\n\n6 * (-100P + 2,000) = -600P + 12,000\n\nSo, profit = (-100P^2 + 2,000P) - (-600P + 12,000) = -100P^2 + 2,000P + 600P - 12,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-100P^2 + 2,600P - 12,000\n\nSo, profit = -100P^2 + 2,600P - 12,000\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of P, and it's in the form of ax^2 + bx + c, where a = -100, b = 2,600, and c = -12,000.\n\nSince the coefficient of P^2 is negative (-100), this means the parabola opens downwards, so the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola.\n\nThe vertex form for a parabola given by y = ax^2 + bx + c has its maximum (or minimum) at x = -b/(2a).\n\nIn this case, P = -b/(2a) = -2,600 / (2 * -100) = 2,600 / 200 = 13.\n\nSo, the profit-maximizing price is $13 per unit.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf P = $13, then Q = -100*13 + 2,000 = -1,300 + 2,000 = 700 units.\n\nRevenue = 13 * 700 = $9,100\n\nCost = 6 * 700 = $4,200\n\nProfit = 9,100 - 4,200 = $4,900\n\nNow, let's check nearby prices to see if this is indeed the maximum.\n\nIf P = $12, then Q = -100*12 + 2,000 = -1,200 + 2,000 = 800 units.\n\nRevenue = 12 * 800 = $9,600\n\nCost = 6 * 800 = $4,800\n\nProfit = 9,600 - 4,800 = $4,800\n\nThat's less than at P = $13.\n\nIf P = $14, then Q = -100*14 + 2,000 = -1,400 + 2,000 = 600 units.\n\nRevenue = 14 * 600 = $8,400\n\nCost = 6 * 600 = $3,600\n\nProfit = 8,400 - 3,600 = $4,800\n\nAgain, less than at P = $13.\n\nWhat about P = $10, which is the original price?\n\nQ = -100*10 + 2,000 = 1,000 units.\n\nRevenue = 10 * 1,000 = $10,000\n\nCost = 6 * 1,000 = $6,000\n\nProfit = 10,000 - 6,000 = $4,000\n\nWhich is less than at P = $13.\n\nAnd P = $11:\n\nQ = -100*11 + 2,000 = -1,100 + 2,000 = 900 units.\n\nRevenue = 11 * 900 = $9,900\n\nCost = 6 * 900 = $5,400\n\nProfit = 9,900 - 5,400 = $4,500\n\nStill less than at P = $13.\n\nSo, it seems that P = $13 is indeed the profit-maximizing price.\n\nAlternatively, I can use calculus to find the maximum profit.\n\nGiven profit = -100P^2 + 2,600P - 12,000\n\nTake the derivative with respect to P:\n\nd(profit)/dP = -200P + 2,600\n\nSet it to zero to find the maximum:\n\n-200P + 2,600 = 0\n\n200P = 2,600\n\nP = 13\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, the profit-maximizing price is $13 per unit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
