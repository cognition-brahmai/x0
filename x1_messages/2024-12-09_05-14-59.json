So, the time is 4 hours.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in hours and minutes. Since 4 hours is already in whole hours, the minutes part would be zero.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the calculation to make sure.\n\nLet me see, 550 multiplied by 4 is indeed 2200. So, yes, the flight takes 4 hours exactly.\n\nTherefore, the flight will take 4 hours and 0 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours and } 0 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
