        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Go program that fetches metrics from an Azure Monitor and displays them in a terminal dashboard that updates every minute. Specifically, it needs to show CPU usage, memory usage, and network throughput. I'm excited to tackle this, but I need to make sure I understand all the parts involved.\n\nFirst things first, I need to get familiar with Azure Monitor and how to retrieve metrics from it using Go. I know that Azure has a lot of APIs, so I need to find the right one for metrics. Probably, I'll be using the Azure Monitor API or something similar.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to make API calls from Go. I think the standard library has packages for HTTP requests, so I can use those to interact with the Azure API. But, I should check if there's an official Azure SDK for Go that can make this easier.\n\nSpeaking of SDKs, I should look into installing any necessary dependencies. If there's an Azure SDK for Go, I need to include that in my project. I'll use Go modules to manage dependencies.\n\nNow, for authentication. Azure services require authentication, so I need to figure out how to authenticate my requests. Maybe using Azure Active Directory (AAD) tokens? I've heard of Azure AD, but I'm not super familiar with it. I need to research how to get an access token to authorize my API requests.\n\nOnce I can retrieve the metrics, I need to parse the response and extract the CPU usage, memory usage, and network throughput data. I should check the API documentation to see what the response format looks like, probably JSON, and then map that to Go structs.\n\nThen, displaying the data in a terminal dashboard. I need a way to render a dashboard in the terminal that updates every minute. I've heard of libraries like Termui or Gocui that can help with terminal UIs in Go. I should look into which one is easiest to use for this purpose.\n\nI need to make sure that the dashboard is clear and readable, with maybe some graphs or charts if possible. Maybe I can find a Go library for drawing simple graphs in the terminal.\n\nAlso, considering that the dashboard needs to update every minute, I need to set up a loop that fetches the data and updates the display at regular intervals. But I have to be careful with how I handle the terminal output to avoid messing up the display.\n\nError handling is also important. If the API request fails or if there's an issue with parsing the response, I need to handle those gracefully and perhaps display an error message in the dashboard.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Set up a new Go module.\n\n2. Research and include the necessary Azure SDK packages for Monitor metrics.\n\n3. Figure out authentication: how to get an Azure AD access token in Go.\n\n4. Write a function to make the API request to fetch metrics.\n\n5. Parse the JSON response and extract the required metrics.\n\n6. Choose a terminal UI library (e.g., Termui) and set up a basic dashboard.\n\n7. Display the metrics in the dashboard, possibly with some formatting or graphs.\n\n8. Set up a loop to update the dashboard every minute.\n\n9. Implement error handling for API requests and parsing.\n\n10. Test the program to ensure it works as expected.\n\nI think breaking it down into these steps will make it manageable. I'll start by setting up the Go module and exploring the Azure SDK for Go.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Go program that retrieves metrics from Azure Monitor and displays them in a terminal dashboard that updates every minute, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an Azure subscription and access to Azure Monitor.\n2. **Azure Active Directory (AAD) Setup**: Set up AAD authentication for your application to access Azure Monitor.\n3. **Go installed**: Make sure Go is installed on your machine.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gizak/termui/v3\"\n\t\"github.com/gizak/termui/v3/widgets\"\n\t\"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity\"\n\t\"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/monitor/armmonitor\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar err error\n\n\tif err = termui.Init(); err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer termui.Close()\n\n\tcpuGauge := widgets.NewGauge()\n\tcpuGauge.Title = \"CPU Usage\"\n\tcpuGauge.Percentage = 0\n\n\tmemoryGauge := widgets.NewGauge()\n\tmemoryGauge.Title = \"Memory Usage\"\n\tmemoryGauge.Percentage = 0\n\n\tnetworkChart := widgets.NewChart()\n\tnetworkChart.Title = \"Network Throughput\"\n\tnetworkChart.Data = [][]float64{{0}}\n\tnetworkChart.Series = []string{\"Throughput\"}\n\n\tgrid := termui.NewGrid()\n\tgrid.SetRect(0, 0, termui.TermWidth(), termui.TermHeight())\n\tgrid.Set(\n\t(termui.NewRow(1.0).Add(\n\t termui.NewCol(1.0, 0, cpuGauge),\n\t termui.NewCol(1.0, 0, memoryGauge),\n\t termui.NewCol(1.0, 0, networkChart),\n\t)),\n\t)\n\n\tgo func() {\n\t\ttick := time.NewTicker(time.Minute).C\n\t\tfor {\n\t\t\tselect {\n\t\t\tcase <-tick:\n\t\t\t\tif cpu, mem, net := fetchMetrics(); cpu != 0 || mem != 0 || net != 0 {\n\t\t\t\t\tcpuGauge.Percentage = cpu\n\t\t\t\t\tmemoryGauge.Percentage = mem\n\t\t\t\t\tnetworkChart.Data[0] = append(networkChart.Data[0][1:], net)\n\t\t\t\t\tif len(networkChart.Data[0]) > 10 {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnetworkChart.Data[0] = networkChart.Data[0][len(networkChart.Data[0])-10:]\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tgrid.Render()\n\t\ttime.Sleep(time.Second)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc fetchMetrics() (float64, float64, float64) {\n\tcred, err := azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential(nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Failed to get credential:\", err)\n\t\treturn 0, 0, 0\n\t}\n\n\tclient := armmonitor.NewMetricsClient(\"<your-subscription-id>\", cred, nil)\n\n\tctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second*10)\n\tdefer cancel()\n\n\tresp, err := client.List(ctx, \"<resource-uri>\", armmonitor.MetricNamespaceNameDefault, \"<metric-names>\", nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Failed to fetch metrics:\", err)\n\t\treturn 0, 0, 0\n\t}\n\n\tcpu := 0.0\n\tmem := 0.0\n\tnet := 0.0\n\n\tfor _, value := range resp.Value {\n\t\tswitch *value.Name.Value {\n\t\tcase \"CPU usage percentage\":\n\t\t\tcpu = *value.Timeseries[0].Data[0].Average\n\t\tcase \"Memory usage percentage\":\n\t\t\tmem = *value.Timeseries[0].Data[0].Average\n\t\tcase \"Network throughput\":\n\t\t\tnet = *value.Timeseries[0].Data[0].Total\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn cpu, mem, net\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Setup**: \n   - Initialize the terminal UI using the `termui` package.\n   - Define gauges and charts for CPU, memory, and network throughput.\n\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - Use `azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential` to handle Azure AD authentication.\n\n3. **Fetching Metrics**:\n   - Use the Azure Monitor client to fetch metrics for CPU, memory, and network throughput.\n\n4. **Dashboard Update**:\n   - Update the dashboard every minute with new metric values.\n   - Use a goroutine to handle periodic updates.\n\n5. **Rendering**:\n   - Render the dashboard continuously, updating the gauges and charts with new data.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Replace `<your-subscription-id>` and `<resource-uri>` with your actual Azure subscription ID and resource URI.\n- Ensure you have the necessary permissions set up in Azure AD for your application.\n- Install dependencies using `go get` for the packages used.\n\nThis solution provides a basic terminal dashboard that updates every minute with CPU, memory, and network throughput metrics from Azure Monitor. Adjustments may be needed based on specific resource types and metric names."
