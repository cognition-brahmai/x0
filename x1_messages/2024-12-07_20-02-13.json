Okay, let's see. First things first, I need to recall what Green's theorem is and how to apply it.\n\nGreen's theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve to a double integral over the plane region bounded by that curve. The formula is:\n\n\u222e(P dx + Q dy) = \u222c(\u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y) dA\n\nSo, I need to compute the partial derivatives \u2202Q/\u2202x and \u2202P/\u2202y.\n\nGiven P = xy and Q = x\u00b2, let's find those derivatives.\n\n\u2202Q/\u2202x = d(x\u00b2)/dx = 2x\n\n\u2202P/\u2202y = d(xy)/dy = x\n\nTherefore, \u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y = 2x - x = x\n\nNow, according to Green's theorem, the line integral is equal to the double integral of x over the region bounded by the unit circle.\n\nSo, I need to compute \u222cx dA over the unit disk.\n\nNow, the unit disk is defined by x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 1.\n\nI think it might be convenient to switch to polar coordinates here, since the unit circle is symmetric and polar coordinates often simplify integrals over circular regions.\n\nIn polar coordinates, x = r cos \u03b8, y = r sin \u03b8, and dA = r dr d\u03b8.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222cx dA = \u222c(r cos \u03b8) (r dr d\u03b8) = \u222c(r\u00b2 cos \u03b8) dr d\u03b8\n\nNow, I need to set the limits of integration for r and \u03b8.\n\nFor the unit disk, r goes from 0 to 1, and \u03b8 goes from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nSo, the integral is:\n\n\u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) \u222b(from 0 to 1) r\u00b2 cos \u03b8 dr d\u03b8\n\nLet's first integrate with respect to r:\n\n\u222b(from 0 to 1) r\u00b2 dr = [r\u00b3/3] from 0 to 1 = 1/3\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) (1/3) cos \u03b8 d\u03b8 = (1/3) \u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) cos \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nNow, \u222b cos \u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 is [sin \u03b8] from 0 to 2\u03c0 = sin(2\u03c0) - sin(0) = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nTherefore, the double integral is (1/3)*0 = 0\n\nSo, according to Green's theorem, the line integral \u222e(P dx + Q dy) = 0\n\nWait a minute, is that possible? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, I have P = xy and Q = x\u00b2.\n\nThen, \u2202Q/\u2202x = 2x and \u2202P/\u2202y = x, so \u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y = x\n\nThen, \u222cx dA over the unit disk.\n\nIn polar coordinates, x = r cos \u03b8, and dA = r dr d\u03b8, so the integral is \u222cr\u00b2 cos \u03b8 dr d\u03b8\n\nIntegrating from r=0 to 1: \u222b r\u00b2 dr = 1/3\n\nThen integrating from \u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0: (1/3) \u222b cos \u03b8 d\u03b8 = (1/3)*0 = 0\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the unit circle and compute the line integral directly to verify.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nParameterize the unit circle as x = cos t, y = sin t, where t goes from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nThen, dx = -sin t dt, dy = cos t dt\n\nGiven P = xy = cos t sin t, and Q = x\u00b2 = cos\u00b2 t\n\nSo, P dx = (cos t sin t)(-sin t dt) = -cos t sin\u00b2 t dt\n\nQ dy = (cos\u00b2 t)(cos t dt) = cos\u00b3 t dt\n\nTherefore, the line integral is:\n\n\u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) (-cos t sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b3 t) dt\n\nLet's see, maybe I can factor this:\n\n\u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) [cos t (cos\u00b2 t - sin\u00b2 t)] dt\n\nWait, cos\u00b3 t - cos t sin\u00b2 t = cos t (cos\u00b2 t - sin\u00b2 t)\n\nAnd cos\u00b2 t - sin\u00b2 t = cos 2t\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) cos t cos 2t dt\n\nNow, using the product-to-sum identities, cos t cos 2t = (1/2)(cos(3t) + cos(t))\n\nSo, the integral is:\n\n(1/2) \u222b(from 0 to 2\u03c0) (cos(3t) + cos(t)) dt = (1/2) [\u222b cos(3t) dt + \u222b cos(t) dt] from 0 to 2\u03c0\n\nEach of these integrals is sin(3t)/3 + sin(t), evaluated from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nsin(3*(2\u03c0)) = sin(6\u03c0) = 0, sin(3*0) = 0, so sin(3t)/3 from 0 to 2\u03c0 is 0\n\nSimilarly, sin(2\u03c0) - sin(0) = 0\n\nTherefore, the entire integral is (1/2)(0 + 0) = 0\n\nSo, indeed, the line integral is 0, which matches the result I got using Green's theorem.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
