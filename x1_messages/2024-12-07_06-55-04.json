You mentioned a scenario about two trains leaving New York and Los Angeles at different speeds, and then you asked how many apples are on the first train. I'm a bit confused because the information provided about the trains' speeds doesn't seem directly related to the number of apples on the first train.\n\nCould you please provide more context or clarify your question? I'll do my best to assist you once I understand what you're asking."
