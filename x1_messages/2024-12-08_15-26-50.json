        "content": "So the factory currently produces 500 units of product A per day. If the demand increases by 30%, how many units should they produce daily to meet this new demand? Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 30% increase in demand means. Percentage increase is calculated based on the original amount. So, if the original demand is 500 units, a 30% increase would be 30% of 500.\n\nTo find 30% of 500, I can multiply 500 by 0.30. Let me do that:\n\n500 \u00d7 0.30 = 150 units.\n\nSo, the demand is increasing by 150 units.\n\nNow, to find the new total demand, I need to add this increase to the original production amount.\n\n500 (original production) + 150 (increase) = 650 units.\n\nTherefore, the factory should produce 650 units daily to meet the new demand.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this? Maybe by using a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to consider that a 30% increase means the new demand is 130% of the original demand. So, I can calculate 130% of 500.\n\nTo find 130% of 500, I can multiply 500 by 1.30.\n\n500 \u00d7 1.30 = 650 units.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 650 units.\n\nIt's important to note that this assumes that the factory can actually produce the additional 150 units without any constraints. In reality, there might be limitations like capacity, workforce, or machinery that could affect whether the factory can meet this increased demand.\n\nBut based on the information given, the factory should produce 650 units daily to meet the new demand after a 30% increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{650} \\]"
