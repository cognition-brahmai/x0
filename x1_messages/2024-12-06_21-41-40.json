So, if each son has an older sister, that means the sister is older than all three sons. So, there's one older sister who is older than Tom, Dick, and Harry. So, in total, the father has three sons and one daughter, making it four children.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each son has an older sister.\" So, it's possible that each son has a different older sister. But that would mean there are three older sisters, each older than one of the sons. But that doesn't make sense because if one sister is older than one son, she wouldn't necessarily be older than the other sons. Hmm.\n\nLet me think differently. If each son has an older sister, does that mean there is at least one sister who is older than all the sons? Or could there be multiple sisters?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"each son has an older sister\" suggests that there is at least one sister who is older than each of the sons. So, it's logical to conclude that there is one sister who is older than all three sons.\n\nTherefore, the father has three sons and one daughter, totaling four children.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are multiple sisters. For example, if there are two sisters, both older than the sons, would that satisfy the condition? Yes, but the minimal interpretation would be that there is one older sister.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify that there isn't more than one older sister. So, technically, there could be more than one older sister.\n\nBut the way the question is worded, \"each son has an older sister,\" it doesn't specify that each son has a different older sister. It just says each son has an older sister, which could be the same sister or different sisters.\n\nTo avoid overcomplicating, I think the simplest and most logical answer is that there is one older sister who is older than all three sons, making a total of four children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
