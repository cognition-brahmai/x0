Currently, there are 20 ambulances, and each ambulance takes an average of 45 minutes for a round trip. The hospital aims to reduce the average waiting time for patients by 15%. Calculate the number of additional ambulances required to achieve this goal, considering no change in the average round-trip time. Explain your reasoning."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional ambulances are required to reduce the average waiting time for patients by 15%, assuming that the average round-trip time remains unchanged.\n\nFirst, let's understand the relationship between the number of ambulances, waiting time, and system capacity.\n\nIn emergency services, the waiting time for patients is inversely related to the number of available ambulances. More ambulances generally mean shorter waiting times because there are more resources to handle requests.\n\nWe can model this situation using queuing theory, specifically the M/M/c model, where:\n\n- M stands for Markovian (Poisson process for arrivals and exponential distribution for service times).\n\n- c represents the number of servers (ambulances in this case).\n\nHowever, for simplicity, and given the constraints of the problem, we can use a proportionality approach to estimate the required number of ambulances.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( n \\) = current number of ambulances = 20\n\n- \\( t \\) = average round-trip time per ambulance = 45 minutes\n\n- \\( w \\) = current average waiting time for patients\n\n- \\( w' \\) = target average waiting time = \\( w - 0.15w = 0.85w \\)\n\nWe need to find the new number of ambulances, \\( n' \\), such that the average waiting time is reduced to \\( w' \\).\n\nAssuming that the arrival rate of emergency calls remains constant, the waiting time is inversely proportional to the number of ambulances. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{w}{w'} = \\frac{n'}{n}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{w}{0.85w} = \\frac{n'}{20}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{0.85} = \\frac{n'}{20}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn' = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{0.85}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn' = 20 \\times 1.1765\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn' \\approx 23.53\n\\]\n\nSince the number of ambulances must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:\n\n\\[\nn' = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to have 24 ambulances to achieve a 15% reduction in average waiting time.\n\nTo find the number of additional ambulances required:\n\n\\[\n\\text{additional ambulances} = n' - n = 24 - 20 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, the hospital needs to add 4 more ambulances.\n\nHowever, let's verify this result using a more rigorous approach with queuing theory.\n\nIn the M/M/c model, the average waiting time \\( w \\) in the queue can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{\\rho^c / c! \\times \\frac{1}{\\mu (c - \\rho)}}{c \\mu - \\lambda}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the arrival rate\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the service rate per ambulance\n\n- \\( \\rho = \\lambda / (\\mu c) \\) is the traffic intensity\n\nBut this formula is quite complex and may not be necessary for our purposes, especially since we are dealing with a proportional reduction in waiting time and assuming that the arrival rate remains constant.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the system's capacity is proportional to the number of ambulances. If we need to reduce the waiting time by 15%, we need to increase the capacity by a factor that achieves this reduction.\n\nGiven that waiting time is inversely proportional to the number of servers (ambulances), the relationship \\( w \\propto 1/n \\) holds.\n\nTherefore, our initial proportionality approach seems reasonable.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through Little's Law, which relates the average number of customers in a system (\\( L \\)), the average arrival rate (\\( \\lambda \\)), and the average time spent in the system (\\( w \\)):\n\n\\[\nL = \\lambda w\n\\]\n\nIf we assume that the number of ambulances affects the waiting time, but the arrival rate remains constant, then reducing \\( w \\) by 15% would require adjusting \\( n \\) accordingly.\n\nHowever, since the exact arrival rate and service times aren't provided, we'll stick with the proportional approach.\n\nThus, the hospital needs to add 4 more ambulances to reduce the average waiting time by 15%, assuming no change in the average round-trip time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
