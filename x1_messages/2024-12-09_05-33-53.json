        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a group of people with different eye colors: 60% have brown eyes, 30% have blue eyes, and 10% have green eyes. We need to find the probability that when we pick two people at random, they have different eye colors.\n\nFirst, I think it's important to understand what it means for two people to have different eye colors. That means neither both have brown, nor both have blue, nor both have green eyes. So, essentially, we're looking for the probability that the first person has one color and the second has a different one.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the total probability of all the scenarios where the two people have different eye colors. That would include:\n\n- First person has brown, second has blue\n\n- First person has brown, second has green\n\n- First person has blue, second has brown\n\n- First person has blue, second has green\n\n- First person has green, second has brown\n\n- First person has green, second has blue\n\nThat's a lot of possibilities. Maybe there's a smarter way to calculate this without listing everything.\n\nI recall that in probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement of what you're looking for and then subtract it from 1. The complement of having different eye colors is having the same eye color. So, maybe I can calculate the probability that both have the same eye color and subtract that from 1 to get the probability of different eye colors.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, find the probability that both have the same eye color.\n\nThis can happen in three ways:\n\n1. Both have brown eyes.\n\n2. Both have blue eyes.\n\n3. Both have green eyes.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events, I can add their probabilities together.\n\nSo, the probability that both have brown eyes is (probability first has brown) times (probability second has brown), assuming independence.\n\nSimilarly for blue and green.\n\nGiven that the selections are random and presuming the group is large enough that selecting one doesn't affect the probability for the second (i.e., sampling with replacement), the probabilities remain constant for each selection.\n\nSo, probability both have brown eyes:\n\nP(BB) = 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36\n\nProbability both have blue eyes:\n\nP(BlBl) = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09\n\nProbability both have green eyes:\n\nP(GG) = 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01\n\nTherefore, total probability both have the same eye color:\n\nP(same) = P(BB) + P(BlBl) + P(GG) = 0.36 + 0.09 + 0.01 = 0.46\n\nThen, the probability that they have different eye colors is:\n\nP(different) = 1 - P(same) = 1 - 0.46 = 0.54\n\nSo, 54%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe by calculating directly the probability of different eye colors.\n\nLet's see.\n\nThe first person can have any eye color. Then, the second person must have a different eye color from the first.\n\nDepending on what the first person has, the probability for the second person changes.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the first has brown (60% chance), then the second must have blue or green (30% + 10% = 40%).\n\n- If the first has blue (30% chance), then the second must have brown or green (60% + 10% = 70%).\n\n- If the first has green (10% chance), then the second must have brown or blue (60% + 30% = 90%).\n\nSo, overall probability is:\n\nP(different) = P(first is brown) * P(second is not brown | first is brown) + P(first is blue) * P(second is not blue | first is blue) + P(first is green) * P(second is not green | first is green)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(different) = (0.6 * 0.4) + (0.3 * 0.7) + (0.1 * 0.9)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n\n0.3 * 0.7 = 0.21\n\n0.1 * 0.9 = 0.09\n\nAdding them up:\n\n0.24 + 0.21 + 0.09 = 0.54\n\nAgain, 54%. That matches the previous result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to pick two people with different eye colors divided by the total number of ways to pick any two people.\n\nBut since we're dealing with probabilities instead of specific numbers, the previous methods seem more straightforward.\n\nI think the complement method is the most efficient here. Calculate the probability of both having the same eye color and subtract it from 1 to get the probability of different eye colors.\n\nSo, final answer: 54%, or 0.54 in decimal form.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.54} \\]"
