The idea is to build a 2D table that stores the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all possible pairs of prefixes of the two input strings. By filling this table iteratively, we can ultimately determine the length of the longest common subsequence for the entire strings.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We create a 2D list (table) with dimensions `(len(text1) + 1) x (len(text2) + 1)` to handle the base cases where one or both strings are empty. This table will store the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all prefixes of `text1` and `text2`.\n\n2. **Filling the table**:\n   - We iterate through each cell of the table, starting from the first character of both strings.\n   - For each character in `text1` and `text2`:\n     - If the characters match, we add 1 to the value from the diagonal cell (i.e., the cell corresponding to the prefixes without these characters).\n     - If the characters don't match, we take the maximum value from the left or top cell (i.e., excluding the current character from one of the strings).\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The value in the bottom-right cell of the table represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the entire strings.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently compute the solution in O(m*n) time complexity, where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings, we can use dynamic programming. This approach builds a table that stores the lengths of the LCS for all possible pairs of prefixes of the two strings. By iteratively filling this table, we can determine the length of the LCS for the entire strings efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a 2D list (table) with dimensions `(len(text1) + 1) x (len(text2) + 1)` to handle base cases where one or both strings are empty.\n\n2. **Filling the table**:\n   - Iterate through each cell of the table.\n   - For each pair of characters from `text1` and `text2`:\n     - If the characters match, add 1 to the value from the diagonal cell (i.e., exclude the current characters).\n     - If the characters don't match, take the maximum value from the left or top cell (i.e., exclude the current character from one of the strings).\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The value in the bottom-right cell of the table is the length of the LCS for the entire strings.\n\nThis method ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef longestCommonSubsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> int:\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    # Create a 2D list to store lengths of longest common subsequence.\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Fill dp table\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    return dp[m][n]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)` initialized to 0, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `text1` and `text2` respectively.\n  \n- **Filling the table**:\n  - For each character in `text1` and `text2`:\n    - If characters match, increment the LCS length by 1 based on the LCS length without these characters.\n    - If characters do not match, take the maximum LCS length by excluding one character from either `text1` or `text2`.\n  \n- **Result**: The bottom-right cell `dp[m][n]` contains the length of the LCS of `text1` and `text2`."
