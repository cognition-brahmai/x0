        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that a factory produces 120 cars every hour. We need to find out how many cars it produces in a week. Okay, first things first, I need to figure out how many hours there are in a week.\n\nI know that:\n\n- There are 24 hours in a day.\n\n- And there are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, to find the total number of hours in a week, I can multiply the number of hours in a day by the number of days in a week. That should give me the total hours in a week.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 168 hours/week\n\nSo, there are 168 hours in a week.\n\nNow, if the factory produces 120 cars every hour, then to find out how many cars it produces in a week, I need to multiply the number of cars produced per hour by the total number of hours in a week.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\n120 cars/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week\n\nBut let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Maybe I can break it down further to double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate how many cars are produced in a day first, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find out how many cars are produced in a day.\n\nWe know there are 24 hours in a day, and the factory produces 120 cars each hour.\n\nSo, cars produced in a day = 120 cars/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n120 \u00d7 24 = 2,880 cars/day\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 2,880 cars every day.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are produced in a week, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week.\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so:\n\n2,880 cars/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 20,160 cars/week\n\nWait a minute, let me verify that again.\n\n120 cars/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 2,880 cars/day\n\nThen, 2,880 cars/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 20,160 cars/week\n\nAlternatively, going back to the first approach:\n\n120 cars/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = ?\n\nLet me calculate 120 \u00d7 168.\n\n120 \u00d7 100 = 12,000\n\n120 \u00d7 60 = 7,200\n\n120 \u00d7 8 = 960\n\nNow, adding them up: 12,000 + 7,200 = 19,200 + 960 = 20,160 cars/week\n\nOkay, both approaches give me the same result, which is 20,160 cars per week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any breaks or downtime in the factory. The problem doesn't mention anything about the factory operating 24/7, so maybe I need to assume some downtime.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that the factory produces 120 cars every hour, without specifying any downtime, I think it's safe to assume that it operates continuously.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 20,160 cars per week.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose the factory operates only during standard business hours, say 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. But again, the problem says \"every hour,\" without specifying any limitations, so I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory has multiple shifts or operates non-stop. But again, without specific information, I'll stick with the assumption that it produces 120 cars every hour, around the clock.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\n- 120 cars/hour\n\n- 168 hours/week\n\n- Therefore, 120 \u00d7 168 = 20,160 cars/week\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- 120 cars/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 2,880 cars/day\n\n- 2,880 cars/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 20,160 cars/week\n\nBoth methods confirm the same result.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The factory produces 20,160 cars in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20160} \\]"
