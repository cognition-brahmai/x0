It's a legendary alchemical substance said to grant the elixir of life, which can grant immortality, and the ability to turn base metals into gold, symbolizing infinite wealth. In the series, it plays a central role in the first book and film, where Harry and his friends try to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands."
