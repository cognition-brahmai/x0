        "content": "At 3:15 PM, the minute hand is pointing directly at the 3 on the clock, which represents 15 minutes. Each number on the clock represents 5 minutes, so the minute hand is at the 3, which is 15 minutes.\n\nNow, the hour hand is a bit more tricky. At 3:00 PM, the hour hand is exactly on the 3. However, by 3:15 PM, the hour hand has moved a quarter of the way towards the 4. This is because there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 15 minutes is a quarter of that.\n\nEach hour on the clock represents 30 degrees, since 360 degrees (the full circle) divided by 12 hours equals 30 degrees per hour. So, at 3:00 PM, the hour hand is at 3 * 30 = 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nIn 15 minutes, the hour hand moves a quarter of the way to the 4. Since the distance between each hour is 30 degrees, a quarter of that is 30 / 4 = 7.5 degrees.\n\nTherefore, at 3:15 PM, the hour hand is at 90 degrees plus 7.5 degrees, which equals 97.5 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nNow, let's find out where the minute hand is. Each minute represents 6 degrees, because 360 degrees divided by 60 minutes equals 6 degrees per minute. At 15 minutes, the minute hand is at 15 * 6 = 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nSo, the hour hand is at 97.5 degrees, and the minute hand is at 90 degrees. The difference between them is 97.5 - 90 = 7.5 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:15 PM is 7.5 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5} \\]"
