        "content": "So, there are 8 billion people in the world, and each person has about 100,000 hairs on their head. I need to find out how many hairs there are in total on all human heads combined.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand the numbers here. 8 billion people is 8,000,000,000 people. And each person has approximately 100,000 hairs.\n\nSo, to find the total number of hairs, I need to multiply the number of people by the average number of hairs per person.\n\nThat is:\n\nTotal hairs = Number of people \u00d7 Average hairs per person\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal hairs = 8,000,000,000 \u00d7 100,000\n\nNow, multiplying these two numbers together.\n\nFirst, I can simplify the multiplication by breaking it down.\n\n8,000,000,000 \u00d7 100,000\n\nI know that 8,000,000,000 is 8 \u00d7 1,000,000,000, and 100,000 is 10^5.\n\nSo, 8 \u00d7 10^9 \u00d7 10^5\n\nWhen multiplying powers of ten, I add the exponents.\n\nSo, 10^9 \u00d7 10^5 = 10^(9+5) = 10^14\n\nThen, 8 \u00d7 10^14\n\nThat's 800,000,000,000,000\n\nSo, 800 trillion hairs in total.\n\nWait, but sometimes these kinds of calculations can be tricky because of the large numbers involved. Maybe I should check this again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n8,000,000,000 \u00d7 100,000\n\nI can write it as 8 \u00d7 10^9 \u00d7 10^5\n\nWhich is indeed 8 \u00d7 10^14\n\nOr, 800,000,000,000,000\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the number of zeros.\n\n8,000,000,000 has 9 zeros.\n\n100,000 has 5 zeros.\n\nSo, multiplying them together should give a number with 14 zeros.\n\n8 followed by 14 zeros is 800,000,000,000,000.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, there are approximately 800 trillion hairs on all human heads combined.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any factors that could affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, not everyone has exactly 100,000 hairs. Some people have more, some have less, and some are bald or have very little hair.\n\nHowever, since the average is given as 100,000, that should account for the variation.\n\nAlso, the world population is not exactly 8 billion; it's a rough estimate. As of now, it's closer to 7.9 billion, but using 8 billion is acceptable for this calculation.\n\nSo, my final answer is approximately 800 trillion hairs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800 \\text{ trillion}} \\]"
