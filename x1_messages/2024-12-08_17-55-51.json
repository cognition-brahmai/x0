        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 800 students in total. Out of these, 65% participate in at least one extracurricular activity. First, I need to find out how many students that is.\n\nTo find 65% of 800, I can calculate it as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students participating} = \\frac{65}{100} \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students participating} = 0.65 \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students participating} = 520 \\]\n\nSo, 520 students are participating in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nNext, out of these 520 students, 40% are involved in sports. I need to find out how many that is.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students involved in sports} = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 520 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students involved in sports} = 0.40 \\times 520 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students involved in sports} = 208 \\]\n\nSo, 208 students are involved in sports.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number of students who are not involved in sports. To find this, I need to consider two groups:\n\n1. Students who participate in extracurricular activities but not in sports.\n\n2. Students who do not participate in any extracurricular activities.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of students who participate in extracurricular activities but not in sports. Since 208 students are involved in sports out of 520 participating students, the remaining students in this group are:\n\n\\[ \\text{Students participating but not in sports} = 520 - 208 = 312 \\]\n\nSecond, we need to find out how many students do not participate in any extracurricular activities. Since 65% participate, the remaining 35% do not participate.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students not participating} = \\frac{35}{100} \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students not participating} = 0.35 \\times 800 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students not participating} = 280 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of students not involved in sports, we add the students who participate in activities other than sports and those who do not participate in any activities:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total students not involved in sports} = 312 + 280 = 592 \\]\n\nTherefore, 592 students are not involved in sports.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm understanding the question correctly. The question asks for the number of students not involved in sports. That should include both the students who participate in non-sports extracurricular activities and those who don't participate in any activities at all. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of students minus the number of students involved in sports.\n\nBut wait, some students not involved in sports might still be involved in other activities. However, in this case, since only the students involved in sports are being subtracted, and the rest are not involved in sports, but may or may not be involved in other activities.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way to look at it.\n\nTotal students = 800\n\nStudents participating in at least one extracurricular activity = 520\n\nStudents involved in sports = 208\n\nTherefore, students not involved in sports would be total students minus students involved in sports.\n\n\\[ \\text{Students not involved in sports} = 800 - 208 = 592 \\]\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering that some students might be involved in multiple activities, but since the question specifies \"at least one extracurricular activity\" and separately mentions sports, and doesn't provide information about overlapping participation in multiple activities beyond sports, I'm assuming that the 40% involved in sports are exclusive to sports, but that might not be the case.\n\nWait, actually, the 40% is of those participating in at least one extracurricular activity, so it's a subset of the 520 students.\n\nSo, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of students not involved in sports is indeed 592.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{592} \\]"
