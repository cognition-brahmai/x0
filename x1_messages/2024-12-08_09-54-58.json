        "content": "Certainly! To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings. The LCS is the longest sequence that appears in both strings in the same order, but not necessarily contiguously.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve this:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D array to store the lengths of LCS for substrings of the input strings.\n2. **Filling the DP table**: Iterate through each character of both strings and fill the DP table based on whether characters match or not.\n3. **Backtracking**: Use the DP table to reconstruct the actual LCS.\n\nLet's write the Python script accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings, we can use dynamic programming. This approach efficiently computes the LCS by storing intermediate results in a table.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **DP Table Initialization**:\n   - Create a 2D list `dp` of size `(len(text1) + 1) x (len(text2) + 1)` to store the lengths of LCS for substrings of `text1` and `text2`.\n\n2. **Filling the DP Table**:\n   - Iterate through each character of both strings.\n   - If characters match, increment the DP value from the diagonal.\n   - If they don't match, take the maximum value from the left or top cell.\n\n3. **Reconstructing the LCS**:\n   - Backtrack from the bottom-right corner of the DP table to collect characters that were part of the LCS.\n   - Traverse the DP table to build the LCS string.\n\n4. **Return the Results**:\n   - The value in `dp[-1][-1]` will be the length of the LCS.\n   - The reconstructed LCS string is built during backtracking.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(text1, text2):\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    \n    # Step 1: Initialize the DP table\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Step 2: Fill the DP table\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # Step 3: Reconstruct the LCS\n    lcs_length = dp[m][n]\n    lcs = []\n    i, j = m, n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n            lcs.append(text1[i - 1])\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    lcs.reverse()\n    \n    return lcs_length, ''.join(lcs)\n\n# Example usage:\ntext1 = \"ABCDAF\"\ntext2 = \"ACBCF\"\nlength, lcs = longest_common_subsequence(text1, text2)\nprint(\"Length of LCS:\", length)\nprint(\"LCS:\", lcs)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **DP Table Construction**: The table `dp` is filled where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the length of LCS of `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`.\n- **Filling Logic**:\n  - If characters `text1[i-1]` and `text2[j-1]` match, increment the value from the diagonal (`dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`).\n  - If they don't match, take the maximum value from either `dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]`.\n- **Backtracking**:\n  - Start from `dp[m][n]` and trace back to reconstruct the LCS by checking matching characters and moving diagonally, left, or up accordingly.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes both the length and the substring of the longest common subsequence between two given strings."
