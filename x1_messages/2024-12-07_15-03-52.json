        "content": "So the question is: if a spider spins a web at a rate of 3 meters per hour, how long will it take to spin a web that is 15 meters long? Hmm, this seems like a straightforward problem involving rate and time.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic formula that relates rate, time, and distance. I think it's:\n\nDistance = Rate \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the \"distance\" is the length of the web, which is 15 meters, and the \"rate\" is 3 meters per hour. I need to find the \"time.\"\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n15 meters = 3 meters/hour \u00d7 Time\n\nNow, I need to solve for Time. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 3 meters/hour:\n\nTime = 15 meters / 3 meters/hour\n\nWhen I do the division, the meters units cancel out, and I'm left with hours.\n\nSo, Time = 5 hours\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the spider spins 3 meters every hour, then in one hour it does 3 meters, in two hours 6 meters, three hours 9 meters, four hours 12 meters, and five hours 15 meters. Yes, that adds up.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If 3 meters take 1 hour, then 15 meters would take x hours. So, 3/1 = 15/x. Solving for x, I get x = 15/3 = 5 hours. Same answer.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using units analysis. I have 15 meters and I need to find out how many hours it takes at 3 meters per hour. So, 15 meters \u00f7 3 meters/hour = 5 hours. Again, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The answer should be 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
