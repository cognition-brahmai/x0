        "content": "So I've got this game here, and I need to figure out the expected value for playing it. Expected value is like the average amount I can expect to win or lose per game if I play many times. It's calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing those up.\n\nOkay, so let's list out the possible outcomes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Winning $100 with a probability of 1/2.\n\n2. Winning $200 with a probability of 1/4.\n\n3. Losing $50 with a probability of 1/4.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the probabilities add up to 1, because something has to happen in the game.\n\nLet's check:\n\n1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1. Okay, good.\n\nNow, for each outcome, I'll multiply the probability by the corresponding gain or loss.\n\n1. For winning $100:\n\nProbability: 1/2\n\nAmount: +$100\n\nContribution to expected value: (1/2) * 100 = $50\n\n2. For winning $200:\n\nProbability: 1/4\n\nAmount: +$200\n\nContribution to expected value: (1/4) * 200 = $50\n\n3. For losing $50:\n\nProbability: 1/4\n\nAmount: -$50\n\nContribution to expected value: (1/4) * (-50) = -$12.50\n\nNow, I'll add up these contributions to get the total expected value:\n\n$50 (from outcome 1) + $50 (from outcome 2) + (-$12.50) (from outcome 3) = $50 + $50 - $12.50 = $100 - $12.50 = $87.50\n\nSo, the expected value for playing this game is $87.50.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst contribution: (1/2)*100 = $50 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond contribution: (1/4)*200 = $50 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThird contribution: (1/4)*(-50) = -$12.50 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal: $50 + $50 - $12.50 = $87.50 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAlright, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the long run average. If I play this game many times, say 100 times, I can expect that:\n\n- About 50 times, I'll win $100 (since probability is 1/2).\n\n- About 25 times, I'll win $200 (since probability is 1/4).\n\n- About 25 times, I'll lose $50 (since probability is 1/4).\n\nSo, total winnings would be:\n\n(50 * 100) + (25 * 200) + (25 * (-50)) = 5000 + 5000 - 1250 = 10,000 - 1,250 = 8,750\n\nThen, the average per game would be 8750 / 100 = $87.50, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, it's consistent.\n\nI think $87.50 is the expected value for playing this game.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{87.50} \\]"
