        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three types of candies: A, B, and C. Their price ratios are given as 2:3:5, respectively. That means for every unit of price, A costs 2 units, B costs 3 units, and C costs 5 units.\n\nFirst, I need to assign variables to these prices. Let's say the price of candy A is 2x, candy B is 3x, and candy C is 5x, where x is a common multiplier. This way, the ratios remain 2:3:5.\n\nNow, the problem states that the total cost of buying 4 candies of type A, 6 candies of type B, and 10 candies of type C is $57. So, I can set up an equation based on this information.\n\nThe cost for 4 candies of type A would be 4 times the price of A, which is 4 * 2x = 8x.\n\nSimilarly, the cost for 6 candies of type B is 6 * 3x = 18x.\n\nAnd the cost for 10 candies of type C is 10 * 5x = 50x.\n\nAdding these up should give the total cost of $57:\n\n8x + 18x + 50x = 57\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n8x + 18x + 50x = 76x\n\nSo, 76x = 57\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 57 / 76\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n57 divided by 76. Hmm, both numbers are divisible by 19.\n\n57 \u00f7 19 = 3\n\n76 \u00f7 19 = 4\n\nSo, x = 3/4 = $0.75\n\nWait, but x should be in dollars since the total is $57. Let me make sure.\n\nYes, x = 3/4 = $0.75\n\nNow, I can find the price of each candy:\n\nPrice of A: 2x = 2 * 0.75 = $1.50\n\nPrice of B: 3x = 3 * 0.75 = $2.25\n\nPrice of C: 5x = 5 * 0.75 = $3.75\n\nLet me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal cost: (4 * 1.50) + (6 * 2.25) + (10 * 3.75) = 6 + 13.5 + 37.5 = 57\n\nYes, that adds up to $57.\n\nSo, the prices are:\n\nCandy A: $1.50 each\n\nCandy B: $2.25 each\n\nCandy C: $3.75 each\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Candy A: } \\$1.50, \\text{ Candy B: } \\$2.25, \\text{ Candy C: } \\$3.75} \\]"
