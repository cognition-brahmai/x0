Despite the moon being the same size in both positions, our brain perceives it differently due to the presence of reference points on the horizon, such as buildings or trees, which help to create a sense of scale. This illusion has puzzled scientists and philosophers for centuries and is still not fully understood, but it's definitely something to marvel at on a clear night.\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\n"
