        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the store is offering a 25% discount on notebooks that originally cost $4.00 each. The student is buying 5 notebooks, and we need to find out how much they save compared to the original price.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 25% discount means. A percentage discount is a reduction in price based on a percentage of the original price. So, 25% off means the student pays 75% of the original price because 100% - 25% = 75%.\n\nBut to find out how much is saved, I should calculate the discount amount per notebook and then multiply it by the number of notebooks purchased.\n\nLet's calculate the discount per notebook:\n\nDiscount per notebook = 25% of $4.00\n\nTo calculate 25% of $4.00, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 25% is equal to 0.25.\n\nSo, discount per notebook = 0.25 * $4.00 = $1.00\n\nThat means, for each notebook, the student saves $1.00.\n\nNow, since the student is buying 5 notebooks, the total savings would be:\n\nTotal savings = discount per notebook * number of notebooks\n\nTotal savings = $1.00 * 5 = $5.00\n\nSo, the student saves $5.00 in total compared to the original price.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total original price and the total sale price, then find the difference.\n\nFirst, total original price for 5 notebooks:\n\nTotal original price = $4.00 * 5 = $20.00\n\nNow, the sale price per notebook is 75% of the original price, since there's a 25% discount.\n\nSale price per notebook = 75% of $4.00 = 0.75 * $4.00 = $3.00\n\nSo, total sale price for 5 notebooks:\n\nTotal sale price = $3.00 * 5 = $15.00\n\nNow, the savings would be the difference between the total original price and the total sale price:\n\nSavings = total original price - total sale price = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that the student saves $5.00.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total discount amount directly.\n\nSince each notebook has a $1.00 discount, and there are 5 notebooks, total savings are $5.00.\n\nOr, considering the overall discount on the total original price.\n\nTotal original price is $20.00, and a 25% discount on $20.00 would be:\n\nTotal discount = 25% of $20.00 = 0.25 * $20.00 = $5.00\n\nAgain, this confirms that the student saves $5.00.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the student saves $5.00 compared to the original price when buying 5 notebooks on sale with a 25% discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
