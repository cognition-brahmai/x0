        "content": "So there are 100,000 households in the city, and 60% of them have at least one pet. That means 60,000 households have pets. Now, out of these pet-owning households, 80% have dogs. So, to find the number of dog-owning households, I need to calculate 80% of 60,000.\n\nLet me do the math: 80% of 60,000 is 0.8 multiplied by 60,000, which equals 48,000.\n\nSo, there are 48,000 dog-owning households in the city.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to this. Maybe some households have more than one dog or other pets too. But the question seems straightforward: it's asking for the number of households that have dogs, assuming that the percentages given are straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations just to be sure. 60% of 100,000 is indeed 60,000. Then, 80% of those 60,000 have dogs, which is 48,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of probabilities. The probability that a household has at least one pet is 60%, and given that they have a pet, the probability that they have a dog is 80%. So, the joint probability that a household has a dog is 60% times 80%, which is 48%.\n\nThen, 48% of 100,000 households would have dogs, which again is 48,000 households.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can approach it differently to confirm. Suppose I consider the total number of pet-owning households first, which is 60,000. Out of these, 80% have dogs. So, 80% of 60,000 is 48,000.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in ratios, 80 out of every 100 pet-owning households have dogs. So, for every 100 pet-owning households, there are 80 dog-owning households.\n\nSince there are 60,000 pet-owning households, I can set up a proportion:\n\n80 dogs / 100 pet households = x dogs / 60,000 pet households.\n\nSolving for x gives me (80/100) * 60,000 = 48,000.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that there are 48,000 dog-owning households in the city.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other interpretation of the question. For example, maybe some households have multiple pets, including multiple dogs, but the question is about households that have at least one dog.\n\nGiven that, I think the calculation stands.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 20% of pet-owning households do not have dogs, which means they might have other pets like cats, birds, etc. But since the question is only about dog-owning households, I don't need to worry about that for now.\n\nSo, in summary, with 100,000 households, 60% have pets, and 80% of those have dogs, leading to 48,000 dog-owning households.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48000} \\]"
