        "content": "In the heart of the Muppet Theater, where laughter and joy reverberate through every corner, Kermit the Frog, the ever-compassionate leader, often finds himself in the role of a guardian, ensuring that his Muppet friends are safe, happy, and well-rested. As the day draws to a close, and the vibrant energy of the theater begins to settle into a peaceful calm, Kermit takes a moment to serenade his friends with a gentle lullaby, soothing their spirits and lulling them into a sweet slumber.\n\nImagine, if you will, the dimly lit dressing room, filled with the soft glow of lanterns and the faint scent of backstage makeup. There, gathered around Kermit, are his dear friends: Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Animal, and the rest of the Muppet cast, their eyes heavy with the day's adventures. Kermit, perched on a worn armchair, his voice a comforting melodic hum, begins to sing:\n\n**Kermit the Frog's Lullaby**\n\n_In the quiet of the night,  \nUnderneath the moon's soft light,  \nClose your eyes and let go,  \nDrift away, don't you know?_\n\n_Miss Piggy, Fozzie too,  \nGonzo and sweet Rizzo, it's true,  \nSleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite,  \nIn this Muppet world, all is right._\n\n_The theater's dark, but dreams are bright,  \nIn your slumber, find pure delight,  \nKermit's here, his song so mild,  \nGuiding you through the night, mile by mile._\n\n_So rest now, my friends so dear,  \nLet the day's worries disappear,  \nIn this moment, all is calm,  \nUnder Kermit's gentle psalm._\n\nAs Kermit's voice fills the room, it wraps around each Muppet like a warm blanket, easing their minds and soothing their souls. Even the most energetic among them, like Animal, feels the tranquilizing effect of Kermit's melody, their eyelids growing heavier with each verse.\n\nThe lullaby continues, weaving a tapestry of comfort and security:\n\n_In the land of nod, where dreams take flight,  \nMay your slumber be both long and light,  \nNo worries, no cares, just sweet repose,  \nIn Muppet dreams, where imaginations chose._\n\n_Every creature, big or small,  \nFind solace in this lullaby call,  \nMay your dreams be filled with joy and mirth,  \nIn this magical night, pure and earth._\n\nKermit's voice is steady and reassuring, a testament to his leadership and his deep affection for his friends. His song carries the weight of a thousand bedtime stories, each note a promise of protection and love.\n\nAs the final strains of the lullaby fade away, the room falls into a serene silence. The Muppets, now fast asleep, breathe deeply, their faces peaceful in slumber. Kermit watches over them, a gentle smile gracing his amphibian features, content in the knowledge that his friends are safe and at peace.\n\nAnd so, in the heart of the Muppet Theater, under the watchful eye of Kermit the Frog, the Muppets drift off to dreamland, cradled by the melody of their leader's lullaby, ready to awaken tomorrow, refreshed and ready for new adventures.\n\n**End of Scene**"
