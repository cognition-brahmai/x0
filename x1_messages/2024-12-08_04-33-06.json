        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with different colored balls: 5 red, 3 green, and 2 blue. I need to find the probability that when I draw one ball without looking, it's not blue. Okay, sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand it completely.\n\nFirst, I need to know what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's usually expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event never happens, and 1 means it always happens. In this case, the event is drawing a ball that is not blue.\n\nNow, to find the probability of drawing a ball that is not blue, I can approach this in a couple of ways. One way is to directly calculate the probability of not drawing a blue ball, and another way is to calculate the probability of drawing a blue ball and then subtract that from 1, since the total probability must add up to 1.\n\nLet me consider the second approach first because it seems simpler. The probability of drawing a blue ball is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls. Then, the probability of not drawing a blue ball would be 1 minus that probability.\n\nSo, let's find the total number of balls in the bag. There are 5 red, 3 green, and 2 blue balls. Adding those up: 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls in total.\n\nNext, the number of blue balls is 2. Therefore, the probability of drawing a blue ball is 2/10, which simplifies to 1/5 or 0.2.\n\nNow, the probability of not drawing a blue ball is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, or 4/5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe I can calculate it directly by finding the number of non-blue balls and dividing by the total number of balls.\n\nLet's try that. The number of non-blue balls is the number of red and green balls combined. So, 5 red + 3 green = 8 balls that are not blue.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a non-blue ball is 8/10, which is also 4/5 or 0.8.\n\nHey, that matches what I got earlier. So, that gives me more confidence that I'm on the right track.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Is there a formula or a general method for solving probability problems like this?\n\nYes, the general formula for probability is:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing any ball that is not blue, which is 8 balls, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 10.\n\nSo, Probability = 8/10 = 0.8\n\nAlternatively, using the complement rule, which is:\n\nProbability of not an event = 1 - Probability of the event\n\nHere, the event is drawing a blue ball, which has a probability of 2/10 = 0.2, so the probability of not drawing a blue ball is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same answer, which is a good sanity check.\n\nNow, I should consider if there are any other factors to consider. For example, is the drawing done with replacement or without? In this problem, it says \"draw one ball,\" so it's without replacement, but since it's only one draw, it doesn't affect the total number of balls.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"without looking,\" which just means it's a random draw, and each ball has an equal chance of being drawn. So, that's already accounted for in the probability calculation.\n\nIs there any chance that the balls are not equally likely to be drawn? For example, maybe some balls are heavier or larger, but nothing in the problem suggests that, so I can assume each ball has an equal chance.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the colors are mutually exclusive. That is, is there any ball that is both red and green, or any combination? The problem lists them as separate colors, so I can assume each ball is only one color.\n\nSo, no overlaps there.\n\nLet me also consider if there is any conditional probability involved. But since it's just one draw, without any conditions mentioned, I don't think conditional probability applies here.\n\nAlright, so sticking with the basic probability formula, I have:\n\nProbability of not drawing a blue ball = Number of non-blue balls / Total number of balls = 8/10 = 0.8\n\nOr, using the complement rule: 1 - (Number of blue balls / Total number of balls) = 1 - (2/10) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n\nBoth methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that 0.8 is the correct probability.\n\nMaybe I can think of it in terms of percentages to make more sense. 0.8 is equivalent to 80%, so there's an 80% chance that the ball drawn is not blue.\n\nThat seems reasonable, given that there are 8 non-blue balls out of 10 total balls.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose I draw a ball and look at its color. If it's not blue, that satisfies the condition. So, the favorable outcomes are red or green balls.\n\nSince there are 5 red and 3 green, that's 8 balls.\n\nTotal balls are 10.\n\nSo, again, 8/10 = 0.8.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to look at this problem, and each approach leads to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the ball drawn is not blue is 0.8, or 80%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.8} \\]"
