        "content": "So I've got this problem here about an online retailer thinking about offering free shipping for orders over $75. They want to see if this might boost their sales. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on right now. The average order value is $60, and the average shipping cost is $8 per order. So, currently, customers are paying for shipping, and the company is covering those costs.\n\nNow, the proposal is to offer free shipping for orders over $75. The company estimates that if they do this, 30% of customers will increase their order value to qualify for free shipping. I need to calculate the potential increase in revenue and the change in shipping costs under this new policy.\n\nAlright, let's start by figuring out what happens with the customers who decide to increase their order value.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are a certain number of orders, say, N orders per period. Currently, each order averages $60, so total revenue is N * $60.\n\nUnder the new policy, 30% of customers will increase their order value to qualify for free shipping. So, 0.3N orders will increase their spending to at least $75.\n\nNow, I need to assume how much more they will spend. The problem says they will increase their order value to qualify for free shipping, but it doesn't specify exactly how much more they will spend beyond $75. For simplicity, maybe I can assume they spend just enough to reach $75, so an additional $15 per order in this group.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Perhaps customers will add items up to $75, but maybe not exactly $75. Maybe they will add more. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll go with the assumption that they increase their order value by exactly $15 each to reach $75.\n\nSo, for the 0.3N orders that increase their spending, their new order value is $60 + $15 = $75.\n\nThe remaining 70% of customers, 0.7N orders, will keep their order value at $60.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new total revenue.\n\nTotal revenue under the new policy:\n\n(0.3N orders * $75) + (0.7N orders * $60)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.3N * 75 = 22.5N\n\n0.7N * 60 = 42N\n\nTotal revenue = 22.5N + 42N = 64.5N\n\nCurrently, total revenue is N * 60 = 60N\n\nSo, the increase in revenue is 64.5N - 60N = 4.5N\n\nNow, what about shipping costs?\n\nCurrently, shipping cost is $8 per order, so total shipping cost is N * 8 = 8N\n\nUnder the new policy, for orders over $75, shipping is free. So, for the 0.3N orders that qualify for free shipping, the company saves $8 per order in shipping costs.\n\nBut, for the 0.7N orders that stay below $75, they still pay for shipping, so the company still incurs $8 per order for these.\n\nSo, total shipping cost under the new policy:\n\n0.7N * 8 = 5.6N\n\nPreviously, it was 8N, so the reduction in shipping cost is 8N - 5.6N = 2.4N\n\nWait a minute, but the company is also offering free shipping for 0.3N orders, which means they are absorbing the shipping cost for those orders. So, actually, their shipping cost should be higher for those orders because they have to cover the $8 per order themselves.\n\nWait, no. If they offer free shipping, it means they are absorbing the shipping cost, meaning they have to pay for shipping themselves for those orders, rather than the customer paying it.\n\nSo, under the new policy, for the 0.3N orders that qualify for free shipping, the company has to pay $8 per order for shipping, and for the 0.7N orders, the customers still pay $8 per order, which the company receives.\n\nWait, but in reality, if the company offers free shipping, they have to pay for the shipping themselves for those orders, right? So, for the 0.3N orders with free shipping, the company incurs an additional cost of $8 per order.\n\nBut in the current setup, customers pay for shipping, so the company receives $8 per order for shipping.\n\nUnder the new policy:\n\n- For the 0.3N orders with free shipping, the company has to pay $8 per order for shipping.\n\n- For the 0.7N orders, customers still pay $8 per order for shipping.\n\nSo, total shipping cost for the company:\n\n0.3N * 8 (cost they incur for free shipping) + 0.7N * 0 (since customers pay for shipping)\n\nWait, no, for the 0.7N orders, customers still pay for shipping, but the company still has to pay for the shipping themselves. Wait, there's a confusion here.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nCurrently, customers pay $8 per order for shipping, and the company uses that $8 to cover the shipping cost.\n\nUnder the new policy:\n\n- For orders over $75, shipping is free, meaning the company has to pay for shipping themselves, without receiving the $8 from the customer.\n\n- For orders under $75, customers still pay $8 for shipping, which the company uses to cover the shipping cost.\n\nSo, total shipping cost for the company is:\n\n- For 0.3N orders: company pays $8 per order, without receiving $8 from customers.\n\n- For 0.7N orders: company pays $8 per order, but receives $8 from customers.\n\nTherefore, total shipping cost is:\n\n0.3N * 8 (since they have to pay themselves) + 0.7N * 0 (since customers pay the $8)\n\nWait, no, they still have to pay for shipping for all orders, but for the 0.7N orders, the customers pay the $8, which covers the shipping cost, so net shipping cost is zero for those orders.\n\nFor the 0.3N orders, they have to pay $8 per order for shipping, since customers don't pay for shipping.\n\nTherefore, total shipping cost is:\n\n0.3N * 8 = 2.4N\n\nPreviously, total shipping cost was N * 8 = 8N, but since customers paid it, the company's cost was zero, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nCurrently:\n\n- Customers pay $8 for shipping per order.\n\n- Company's shipping cost is $8 per order.\n\n- So, net shipping cost for the company is zero.\n\nUnder the new policy:\n\n- For orders over $75 (0.3N orders), customers don't pay for shipping, but the company still has to pay $8 per order for shipping.\n\n- For orders under $75 (0.7N orders), customers pay $8 for shipping, which covers the company's shipping cost.\n\nTherefore, total shipping cost for the company is only for the 0.3N orders where customers don't pay for shipping.\n\nSo, total shipping cost is 0.3N * 8 = 2.4N\n\nPreviously, the net shipping cost was zero, since customers paid for shipping.\n\nWait, but the company had to handle shipping for all orders, but customers paid for it. So, perhaps the net shipping cost was zero, but now, for 0.3N orders, the company has to pay for shipping without receiving payment from customers.\n\nSo, the increase in shipping cost is 2.4N.\n\nTherefore, the change in shipping costs is an increase of 2.4N.\n\nNow, looking back at the revenue:\n\nIncrease in revenue is 4.5N\n\nIncrease in shipping cost is 2.4N\n\nTherefore, net increase in profit is 4.5N - 2.4N = 2.1N\n\nSo, the company would see an increase in profit of 2.1N under this new policy.\n\nBut let's make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that currently, the company's net shipping cost is zero, since customers pay for shipping, but the company still has to handle the shipping, so perhaps the shipping cost is already factored into their costs.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of profits.\n\nLet\u2019s define profit as revenue minus costs, where costs include shipping costs.\n\nCurrently:\n\nRevenue: N * 60\n\nShipping cost: N * 8\n\nSo, profit: 60N - 8N = 52N\n\nUnder new policy:\n\nRevenue: (0.3N * 75) + (0.7N * 60) = 22.5N + 42N = 64.5N\n\nShipping cost: 0.3N * 8 = 2.4N\n\nProfit: 64.5N - 2.4N = 62.1N\n\nSo, increase in profit: 62.1N - 52N = 10.1N\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nUnder the new policy:\n\n- Revenue increases by 4.5N (from 60N to 64.5N)\n\n- Shipping cost increases by 2.4N (from 0 to 2.4N)\n\nBut in the current scenario, shipping cost is already 8N, but since customers pay 8N, net shipping cost is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me define contribution margin.\n\nCurrently:\n\nContribution margin: revenue - variable costs\n\nAssuming that the only variable cost is shipping cost.\n\nSo, contribution margin: 60N - 8N = 52N\n\nUnder new policy:\n\nContribution margin: 64.5N - 2.4N = 62.1N\n\nIncrease in contribution margin: 62.1N - 52N = 10.1N\n\nSo, the company would see an increase in profit of 10.1N.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nTherefore, by offering free shipping on orders over $75, and assuming that 30% of customers increase their order value to qualify for free shipping, the company can expect an increase in profit of 10.1N.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any other costs involved.\n\nIs there any other cost associated with offering free shipping, such as potentially higher shipping costs per order, or handling costs?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any other costs, so I'll assume that the only additional cost is the shipping cost for the free shipping orders.\n\nAnother consideration is that by increasing the order value, the company might be selling more products, which have their own costs.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify if the additional $15 in order value is just to qualify for free shipping, or if customers are buying more profitable items.\n\nAssuming that the additional $15 in sales has the same cost structure as the rest of the products, then the contribution margin would increase proportionally.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps the problem assumes that the marginal cost of the additional products is the same as the existing products, so the contribution margin remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company absorbs the shipping cost for these orders, but the additional sales contribute to covering those costs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the contribution margin per order.\n\nCurrently:\n\n- Average order value: $60\n\n- Shipping cost: $8\n\n- Assuming that the product cost is included in the order value, so contribution margin is order value minus product cost minus shipping cost.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the product cost, so perhaps we should assume that the entire order value is contribution margin, and shipping is a separate cost.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $60 order value includes both the product price and the shipping price, but since shipping is separate, maybe it's better to consider the product revenue as order value minus shipping.\n\nSo, product revenue: $60 - $8 = $52 per order\n\nUnder the new policy:\n\nFor orders over $75 (0.3N orders):\n\n- Order value: $75\n\n- Shipping: free (company pays $8)\n\n- Product revenue: $75 (since shipping is free)\n\nFor orders under $75 (0.7N orders):\n\n- Order value: $60\n\n- Shipping: $8 (paid by customer)\n\n- Product revenue: $60 - $8 = $52\n\nTotal product revenue:\n\n(0.3N * 75) + (0.7N * 52) = 22.5N + 36.4N = 58.9N\n\nTotal shipping cost:\n\n0.3N * 8 = 2.4N\n\nTotal profit:\n\n58.9N - 2.4N = 56.5N\n\nCurrent profit:\n\n(0.3N * 52) + (0.7N * 52) = N * 52\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, under current policy:\n\nProduct revenue: N * 52\n\nShipping revenue: N * 8\n\nTotal revenue: 52N + 8N = 60N\n\nShipping cost: N * 8\n\nProfit: 60N - 8N = 52N\n\nUnder new policy:\n\nProduct revenue: 0.3N * 75 + 0.7N * 52 = 22.5N + 36.4N = 58.9N\n\nShipping revenue: 0.7N * 8 = 5.6N\n\nTotal revenue: 58.9N + 5.6N = 64.5N\n\nShipping cost: 0.3N * 8 = 2.4N\n\nProfit: 64.5N - 2.4N = 62.1N\n\nSo, increase in profit: 62.1N - 52N = 10.1N\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the company can expect an increase in profit of 10.1N by offering free shipping on orders over $75, assuming that 30% of customers increase their order value to qualify for free shipping.\n\nBut, to make this more concrete, perhaps I should express this in terms of percentages or per order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company should consider the impact on the number of orders.\n\nIf offering free shipping attracts more customers and increases the total number of orders, that could have a bigger impact.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any change in the number of orders, only in the order value for a certain percentage of customers.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the potential increase in revenue is 4.5N, and the increase in shipping costs is 2.4N, leading to a net increase in profit of 2.1N.\n\nWait, earlier I had 10.1N, now I'm saying 2.1N. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nUnder the new policy:\n\n- Revenue increase: 64.5N - 60N = 4.5N\n\n- Shipping cost increase: 2.4N (from 0 to 2.4N)\n\n- Net profit increase: 4.5N - 2.4N = 2.1N\n\nBut earlier, when I considered contribution margins, I had an increase of 10.1N.\n\nI think there's confusion in how I'm calculating profits.\n\nLet me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Current situation:\n\n- Revenue: 60N\n\n- Shipping cost: 8N\n\n- Profit: 60N - 8N = 52N\n\n- New situation:\n\n- Revenue: 64.5N\n\n- Shipping cost: 2.4N\n\n- Profit: 64.5N - 2.4N = 62.1N\n\n- Increase in profit: 62.1N - 52N = 10.1N\n\nWait, but in the current situation, the shipping cost is already covered by the shipping fee paid by customers, so perhaps the profit is actually 60N - 8N = 52N, as above.\n\nUnder the new policy, the company has to pay for shipping on 0.3N orders, which is 2.4N, and the revenue increases by 4.5N, so profit increases by 4.5N - 2.4N = 2.1N.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, it's 10.1N.\n\nI think the confusion lies in how the shipping cost is treated.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of contribution margin.\n\nContribution margin is revenue minus variable costs.\n\nAssuming that the only variable cost is shipping cost.\n\nCurrently:\n\n- Contribution margin: 60N - 8N = 52N\n\nUnder new policy:\n\n- Contribution margin: 64.5N - 2.4N = 62.1N\n\n- Increase: 62.1N - 52N = 10.1N\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company was already covering shipping costs with the shipping fees collected from customers, so their net shipping cost was zero.\n\nUnder the new policy, they are absorbing the shipping cost for 0.3N orders, which is 2.4N.\n\nTherefore, their net shipping cost increases by 2.4N.\n\nTheir revenue increases by 4.5N.\n\nTherefore, net increase in profit is 4.5N - 2.4N = 2.1N\n\nBut according to the contribution margin approach, it's 10.1N.\n\nI think the contribution margin approach is more accurate here.\n\nTherefore, the company can expect an increase in profit of 10.1N by offering free shipping on orders over $75.\n\nThis suggests that the policy is beneficial, as it increases profit by 10.1N.\n\nHowever, the company should also consider other factors, such as the potential increase in order sizes beyond $75, or the impact on customer behavior and long-term loyalty.\n\nAdditionally, the company should verify the accuracy of the 30% estimate and ensure that the additional shipping costs are manageable.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided data, offering free shipping on orders over $75 could lead to a significant increase in profit, making it a worthwhile strategy for the online retailer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10.1N} \\]\n"
