        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with 3 doctors, and each doctor has 4 patients who visit them every week. That means, initially, there are 3 doctors \u00d7 4 patients = 12 patient appointments in total, right?\n\nNow, the mayor changes the rule and says that each patient must see two different doctors per week. Okay, so each patient who used to see one doctor now has to see two different ones.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many patients there are in total. Since there are 3 doctors and each has 4 patients, but these patients might be overlapping, meaning some patients might be seeing more than one doctor. Wait, but initially, each patient was seeing only one doctor, as they had weekly visits to their respective doctors. So, there are 3 doctors \u00d7 4 patients = 12 patients in total, assuming no overlap.\n\nBut, if there are only 4 patients per doctor and no patient is seeing more than one doctor, then there are 12 unique patients.\n\nNow, if each of these 12 patients has to see two different doctors per week, that means each patient will have two appointments instead of one.\n\nSo, the total number of appointments will be 12 patients \u00d7 2 appointments each = 24 appointments.\n\nInitially, there were 12 appointments, so the number of new appointments created would be 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider how these appointments are distributed among the doctors.\n\nLet's think about it differently. There are 3 doctors: let's call them Doctor A, Doctor B, and Doctor C. Each had 4 patients initially.\n\nSo, Doctor A had patients 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nDoctor B had patients 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\nDoctor C had patients 9, 10, 11, 12.\n\nNow, each patient has to see two different doctors. So, for patient 1, who was seeing Doctor A, now has to see Doctor A and one other doctor, say Doctor B.\n\nSimilarly, patient 2 sees Doctor A and Doctor C.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this might not be the best way to assign them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the patients can choose any two doctors, as long as they are different.\n\nIn that case, the total number of possible pairs of doctors is \"3 choose 2\", which is 3 combinations: A and B, A and C, B and C.\n\nNow, if patients are distributed among these pairs, we need to see how many new appointments are created.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nLet's go back to the initial approach.\n\nThere are 12 patients, and each needs to see two different doctors.\n\nSo, total appointments needed: 12 patients \u00d7 2 = 24 appointments.\n\nInitially, there were 12 appointments (each patient seeing one doctor).\n\nTherefore, the number of new appointments created is 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nEach new appointment involving two doctors per patient means that for each patient, there is one additional appointment beyond the initial one.\n\nSo, for 12 patients, that's 12 additional appointments.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, think about it in terms of doctor-patient relationships.\n\nInitially, each doctor has 4 patients.\n\nAfter the change, each patient sees two doctors.\n\nSo, the total number of doctor-patient relationships (appointments) should be twice the number of patients, which is 24.\n\nInitially, there were 12 appointments, so 12 new appointments are created.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a consideration of how the doctors' schedules are affected.\n\nLet's consider the total number of appointments each doctor will have.\n\nInitially, Doctor A had 4 patients.\n\nAfter the change, each patient sees two doctors, so each doctor will have more patients.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of appointments each doctor will have.\n\nThere are 12 patients, each seeing two doctors, so total appointments are 24.\n\nThere are 3 doctors, so on average, each doctor will have 24 / 3 = 8 appointments.\n\nInitially, each doctor had 4 appointments, so each doctor will have 8 - 4 = 4 new appointments.\n\nTherefore, total new appointments across all doctors are 3 doctors \u00d7 4 new appointments = 12 new appointments.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nTotal new appointments: 12.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different way to see it.\n\nLet's consider that each pair of doctors will share some patients.\n\nThe number of unique pairs of doctors is 3 choose 2, which is 3 pairs: A-B, A-C, B-C.\n\nIf patients are assigned to these pairs, then the number of new appointments per pair would depend on how many patients are assigned to each pair.\n\nBut without specific information on how patients are assigned to doctor pairs, it's probably safest to stick with the initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of new appointments created is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
