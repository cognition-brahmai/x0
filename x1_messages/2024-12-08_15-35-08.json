        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with 100 houses, and each house has either cats or dogs as pets. No house has both, right? Because it says \"either cats or dogs.\" So, it's exclusive.\n\nNow, each cat owner has exactly 3 cats, and each dog owner has exactly 4 dogs. And altogether, there are 312 pets in the town. We need to find out how many houses have cats.\n\nLet me try to translate this into math. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of houses with cats.\n\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number of houses with dogs.\n\nSince there are 100 houses in total:\n\n\\[ c + d = 100 \\]\n\nEach cat house has 3 cats, so the total number of cats is \\( 3c \\).\n\nEach dog house has 4 dogs, so the total number of dogs is \\( 4d \\).\n\nAnd the total number of pets is 312:\n\n\\[ 3c + 4d = 312 \\]\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( c + d = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3c + 4d = 312 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( c \\) and \\( d \\).\n\nHmm, I can use the first equation to express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ d = 100 - c \\]\n\nNow, plug this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3c + 4(100 - c) = 312 \\]\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n\\[ 3c + 400 - 4c = 312 \\]\n\n\\[ -c + 400 = 312 \\]\n\n\\[ -c = 312 - 400 \\]\n\n\\[ -c = -88 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 88 \\]\n\nSo, there are 88 houses with cats.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 88 houses with cats, each having 3 cats, that's \\( 88 \\times 3 = 264 \\) cats.\n\nThen, there are \\( 100 - 88 = 12 \\) houses with dogs, each having 4 dogs, so \\( 12 \\times 4 = 48 \\) dogs.\n\nTotal pets: \\( 264 + 48 = 312 \\), which matches the total given.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used elimination or other methods to solve the system of equations, but this substitution method worked fine here.\n\nIt's important to note that each house has either cats or dogs, not both, and that all houses have at least one pet, since they either have cats or dogs.\n\nAlso, the numbers worked out nicely without any fractions, which makes sense because you can't have a fraction of a house.\n\nSo, the answer is 88 houses have cats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]"
