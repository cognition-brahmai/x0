        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 green apples and 6 red apples. I'm supposed to pick one apple at random, put it back, and then pick another one at random. I need to find out the probability that both apples I picked were green.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the total number of apples in the box. There are 4 green and 6 red, so total apples are 4 + 6 = 10 apples.\n\nNow, since I'm picking one apple at random, the probability of picking a green apple the first time should be the number of green apples divided by the total number of apples. So, that's 4 green out of 10 total, which is 4/10 or simplified to 2/5.\n\nOkay, so the probability of the first apple being green is 2/5.\n\nNow, here's important part: I put the first apple back into the box before picking the second one. That means the total number of apples remains the same, and the probabilities don't change for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a green apple the second time is also 2/5.\n\nSince these are two separate events and the first one doesn't affect the second (because I'm putting it back), these are independent events. To find the probability of both events happening together (both apples being green), I need to multiply their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, probability of both apples being green = (probability of first apple being green) \u00d7 (probability of second apple being green) = (2/5) \u00d7 (2/5).\n\nNow, multiplying those fractions: 2 \u00d7 2 is 4, and 5 \u00d7 5 is 25, so it's 4/25.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using combinations or something else.\n\nLet me think: since I'm replacing the apple each time, it's with replacement. So, the total number of possible outcomes for each pick is 10, and since I'm picking twice, the total number of possible outcomes is 10 \u00d7 10 = 100.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes, which is picking a green apple both times. There are 4 green apples, so the number of ways to pick a green apple the first time is 4, and since I'm putting it back, the number of ways to pick a green apple the second time is also 4.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 \u00d7 4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 16/100, which simplifies to 4/25.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier. So, 4/25 is the probability that both apples are green.\n\nLet me just double-check if I'm missing anything. Is there any other factor that could affect the probability here? The problem says the apples are picked at random, and it's with replacement, so I think that's all.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the order. Does the order in which I pick the apples matter? In this case, since I'm picking one and then another, it's a sequence, but since both need to be green, the order doesn't really matter. It's the same probability for each pick, and I'm multiplying them.\n\nJust to be thorough, sometimes in probability problems, especially without replacement, the order matters, but here, since it's with replacement, the probabilities stay the same.\n\nSo, I think 4/25 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}} \\]"
