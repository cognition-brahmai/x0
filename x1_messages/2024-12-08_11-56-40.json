        "content": "Let's see. So, we have Alice, Bob, and Carol, each with a different number of apples. According to the problem, Alice has twice as many apples as Bob, and Carol has three times as many apples as Bob. Altogether, they have 72 apples. I need to find out how many apples Bob has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let's say Bob has B apples. Since Alice has twice as many as Bob, Alice has 2B apples. And Carol has three times as many as Bob, so Carol has 3B apples.\n\nNow, together, they have 72 apples. So, if I add up Alice's, Bob's, and Carol's apples, it should equal 72. That is:\n\nAlice + Bob + Carol = 72\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of B:\n\n2B + B + 3B = 72\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n6B = 72\n\nNow, to find B, I need to divide both sides by 6:\n\nB = 72 / 6\n\nB = 12\n\nSo, Bob has 12 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If Bob has 12 apples, then Alice has twice that, which is 24 apples, and Carol has three times Bob's amount, which is 36 apples. Adding those up: 12 + 24 + 36 = 72. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
