The games listed are World of Warcraft, Fortnite, League of Legends, Minecraft, and Among Us. I'm not super into gaming, but I've heard of most of these, so let's see what I can figure out.\n\nFirst up, World of Warcraft. I think this is probably an MMORPG, which stands for Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. I know that because I've seen people talking about it, and it has a huge world where players can explore, complete quests, and interact with each other. It's been around for a long time, like over 15 years, so it must be pretty popular in the RPG genre.\n\nNext is Fortnite. This one is a bit tricky because it seems like it has elements of different genres. I know that Fortnite is known for its battle royale mode, where lots of players drop onto an island, scavenge for weapons, and fight until only one person or team is left. So, I'd say its primary genre is Battle Royale. But I've also heard that there's a creative mode where players can build and design their own levels, which sounds a bit like Minecraft. So, maybe it has elements of sandbox gaming as well, but I think its main genre is Battle Royale.\n\nThen there's League of Legends. I've heard a lot about this one; it's very popular, especially in esports. From what I understand, it's a MOBA, which stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. In these types of games, two teams of players control champions with unique abilities and fight against each other to destroy the opponent's base. It's all about strategy, teamwork, and skilled gameplay. So, definitely a MOBA.\n\nMinecraft is another one I'm familiar with. It's a sandbox game where players can build and create anything they can imagine using blocks in a 3D world. There are different modes, like survival, where you have to gather resources and craft items to stay alive, and creative mode, where you have unlimited resources and can build without worrying about survival. So, I'd classify Minecraft as a Sandbox or Creative game.\n\nLastly, Among Us. This one is relatively new but has gained a lot of popularity recently, especially with streaming and social media. Among Us is a social deduction game where players are aboard a spaceship, and some of them are impostors trying to kill the crewmates without getting caught. The crewmates have to complete tasks and figure out who the impostors are through discussion and voting. It's all about deception, deduction, and teamwork. So, I think Among Us falls under the category of Social Deduction or Party games.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n- World of Warcraft: MMORPG\n\n- Fortnite: Battle Royale (with some Sandbox elements)\n\n- League of Legends: MOBA\n\n- Minecraft: Sandbox/Creative\n\n- Among Us: Social Deduction/Party\n\nI hope this classification makes sense. If I'm missing anything or if there's more to these genres, feel free to correct me."
