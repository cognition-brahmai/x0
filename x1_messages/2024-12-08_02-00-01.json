        "content": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 4 centimeters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0(4 cm)\u00b3\n\nFirst, calculate the cube of the radius:\n\n(4 cm)\u00b3 = 4 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 4 cm = 64 cm\u00b3\n\nNow, multiply this by 4/3 and \u03c0:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 64 cm\u00b3\n\nV = (256/3)\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nAlternatively, if you approximate \u03c0 as 3.1416, you can calculate a numerical value:\n\nV \u2248 (256/3) \u00d7 3.1416 cm\u00b3\n\nV \u2248 85.3333 \u00d7 3.1416 cm\u00b3\n\nV \u2248 268.0826 cm\u00b3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 268.08 cubic centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{268.08 \\text{ cm}^3} \\]"
