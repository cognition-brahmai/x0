        "content": "This is a classic problem known as the Monty Hall problem. Let's break it down.\n\nInitially, there are three doors: Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3. Behind one of them is a prize, and the other two have nothing. You pick Door 1.\n\nNow, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens Door 2 to show that there's nothing behind it. The question is, should you stick with Door 1 or switch to Door 3?\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like it doesn't matter because there are now two doors left, and the prize must be behind one of them. So, the probability should be 50-50, right?\n\nBut actually, that's not the case. Here's why:\n\nWhen you first chose Door 1, the probability that the prize was behind it was 1/3, and the probability that it was behind either Door 2 or Door 3 was 2/3.\n\nNow, the host opens Door 2 and shows that there's nothing behind it. This doesn't change the initial probabilities. So, the probability that the prize is behind Door 1 is still 1/3, and the probability that it's behind Door 3 is now 2/3, because Door 2 has been eliminated.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door 3 gives you a higher probability of winning the prize.\n\nTo make it clearer, let's consider all possible scenarios:\n\n1. The prize is behind Door 1 (your initial choice). If you stick, you win. If you switch, you lose.\n\n2. The prize is behind Door 2. But the host opens Door 2 to show nothing, which doesn't make sense because the host wouldn't open the door with the prize. So, this scenario is impossible given the host's action.\n\n3. The prize is behind Door 3. If you stick, you lose. If you switch, you win.\n\nWait a minute, in scenario 2, the host wouldn't open Door 2 if the prize is behind it. So, the host only opens Door 2 if the prize is behind Door 1 or Door 3.\n\nLet's adjust our thinking:\n\n- If the prize is behind Door 1, the host can open either Door 2 or Door 3, both having nothing.\n\n- If the prize is behind Door 3, the host must open Door 2, because Door 1 is your choice and Door 3 has the prize.\n\nBut in the problem, the host opens Door 2. So, we need to consider both possibilities:\n\n1. Prize behind Door 1: host opens Door 2.\n\n2. Prize behind Door 3: host opens Door 2.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible when the host opens Door 2.\n\nNow, what's the probability that the prize is behind Door 1 given that the host opened Door 2?\n\nSimilarly, what's the probability that the prize is behind Door 3 given that the host opened Door 2?\n\nLet's use conditional probability here.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- P(prize behind Door 1) = 1/3\n\n- P(prize behind Door 3) = 2/3 (since initially, it's 2/3 that the prize is not behind Door 1)\n\nNow, the host opens Door 2.\n\nGiven that, the probability that the prize is behind Door 1 remains 1/3, and the probability that it's behind Door 3 is still 2/3.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door 3 is better.\n\nAlternatively, think about it this way: by switching, you effectively get to choose both Door 2 and Door 3 initially, but since the host shows that Door 2 is empty, the entire probability of 2/3 now shifts to Door 3.\n\nSo, switching doubles your chances of winning compared to sticking with Door 1.\n\nTherefore, you should switch to Door 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{switch to Door 3}} \\]"
