        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 50 houses, and each house has at least one person living in it. The total number of people in the village is 100. We need to find out the maximum number of houses that can have just one person living in them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We want to maximize the number of houses that have only one resident. That means, for the rest of the houses, we need to minimize the number of residents so that the total adds up to 100 people.\n\nSince each house must have at least one person, the minimum number of people per house is one. But to maximize the number of houses with one person, I should try to have as many houses as possible with just one person, and then have the remaining houses accommodate the extra people.\n\nLet's denote the number of houses with only one person as x. Then, the remaining houses, which are 50 - x, will have to accommodate the remaining people, which is 100 - x.\n\nNow, to minimize the number of people in these remaining houses, I should have each of them have as few people as possible, but since each already has at least one, the extra people would be distributed among them.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since these houses already have one person (as per the problem statement), to minimize the number of people in these houses, I should have them have just one person each. But that can't be, because then the total number of people would be equal to the number of houses, which is 50, but we have 100 people.\n\nSo, I need to adjust my approach.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf I have x houses with one person each, then the remaining 50 - x houses must accommodate the remaining 100 - x people.\n\nTo maximize x, I need to minimize the number of people in the remaining houses. The minimum number of people per house is one, but since these houses already have one person, to minimize further, I need to see how much I can pack into these remaining houses.\n\nWait, actually, each house already has at least one person, so for the remaining houses, the minimal number of people they can have is one. But if I assign only one person to each of the remaining houses, the total number of people would be 50, which is less than 100.\n\nSo, I need to have some houses with more than one person.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- x houses have 1 person each.\n\n- The remaining 50 - x houses have at least one person each, but to minimize the number of people in these houses beyond the first person, I should have as many of these houses as possible have just one person, but since I need to account for the remaining 100 - x people, some of these houses will have more than one person.\n\nWait, this seems confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that all 50 houses have at least one person. That accounts for 50 people. Now, there are 100 - 50 = 50 additional people to be distributed among the houses.\n\nTo maximize the number of houses with only one person, I need to minimize the number of houses that receive these additional people.\n\nIn other words, I should add as many of these additional people as possible into as few houses as possible.\n\nSo, if I have y houses that receive additional people, then these y houses will have at least two people (since they already have one and are receiving at least one more).\n\nThe remaining 50 - y houses will have only one person each.\n\nOur goal is to maximize 50 - y, which means minimizing y.\n\nThe total number of additional people is 50.\n\nIf each of these y houses receives at least one additional person, then the minimum number of additional people is y.\n\nBut actually, to minimize y, I need to maximize the number of additional people per house.\n\nIn other words, to minimize y, I should have some houses receive as many additional people as needed.\n\nSo, if I have y houses receiving additional people, and I want to minimize y, I should have each of these y houses receive as many additional people as possible.\n\nThe maximum number of additional people a house can receive is 100 - 50 = 50, but that would mean only one house has all the additional people, which is possible.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each house has at least one person, so if one house has 50 additional people, making it have 51 people, and the other 49 houses have one person each, that adds up to 51 + 49 = 100 people.\n\nIn this case, the number of houses with only one person is 49.\n\nIs that the maximum?\n\nWait, but maybe I can have more houses with one person if I distribute the additional people differently.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I have y houses receiving additional people, and each of these y houses receives at least one additional person, then the minimum number of additional people is y.\n\nBut since I have 50 additional people, y cannot be more than 50.\n\nHowever, to minimize y, I need to maximize the number of additional people per house.\n\nSo, the minimal y is ceiling of 50 divided by the maximum additional people per house.\n\nBut there's no upper limit on how many additional people a house can have, so y can be as small as 1 (if one house receives all 50 additional people).\n\nIn that case, the number of houses with only one person is 50 - 1 = 49.\n\nIs there a way to have more than 49 houses with one person?\n\nWait, perhaps if some houses have more than one additional person.\n\nFor example, if I have two houses, each receiving 25 additional people, then y = 2, and the number of houses with one person is 50 - 2 = 48.\n\nThat's fewer than 49.\n\nNot better.\n\nOr, if I have five houses, each receiving 10 additional people, y = 5, and houses with one person are 50 - 5 = 45.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo, to minimize y, I need to have as few houses as possible receiving the additional people, which means having one house receive all the additional people.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of houses with only one person is 50 - 1 = 49.\n\nBut wait, let's check if that adds up correctly.\n\nOne house has 1 + 50 = 51 people.\n\n49 houses have 1 person each.\n\nTotal people: 51 + 49 = 100.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nIs there any other way to have more than 49 houses with one person?\n\nSuppose I try to have 50 houses with one person, which would total 50 people, but I need 100 people.\n\nSo, I need an additional 50 people.\n\nBut if all houses already have one person, and I need 50 more people, I have to distribute these 50 people among the houses.\n\nIf I distribute one additional person to each of 50 houses, then all houses would have two people each, and no house would have only one person.\n\nThat's not maximizing the number of houses with one person.\n\nAlternatively, if I distribute the additional people to fewer houses, I can have more houses with only one person.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the minimal number of houses receiving additional people is one, which allows the maximum number of houses with one person to be 49.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of houses that can have only one person is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]"
