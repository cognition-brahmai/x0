Below is a PowerShell script that accomplishes the task of finding the top 10 largest files in a specified directory, including their paths and sizes.\n\n```powershell\n# Define the directory path to search\n$directoryPath = \"C:\\path\\to\\directory\"\n\n# Get all files in the directory and sort them by length (size) in descending order\n$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath -File | Sort-Object Length -Descending\n\n# Select the top 10 files\n$topFiles = $files | Select-Object -First 10\n\n# Format and display the results\n$topFiles | ForEach-Object {\n    [PSCustomObject]@{\n        Name = $_.Name\n        FullName = $_.FullName\n        SizeMB = \"{0:N2}\" -f ($_.Length / 1MB)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Define the Directory Path:** \n   - Set the `$directoryPath` variable to the directory you want to search.\n\n2. **Retrieve and Sort Files:**\n   - Use `Get-ChildItem` with the `-File` parameter to get only files in the specified directory.\n   - Pipe the results to `Sort-Object Length -Descending` to sort the files by size in descending order.\n\n3. **Select Top 10 Files:**\n   - Use `Select-Object -First 10` to get the top 10 largest files.\n\n4. **Format and Display Results:**\n   - Use `ForEach-Object` to create a custom object for each file, displaying the file name, full path, and size in megabytes (formatted to two decimal places).\n\n### How to Use:\n1. **Open PowerShell:**\n   - Open the PowerShell application with appropriate permissions.\n\n2. **Edit the Script:**\n   - Modify the `$directoryPath` variable to point to the directory you want to analyze.\n\n3. **Run the Script:**\n   - Copy and paste the script into the PowerShell window and press Enter to execute it.\n\nThis script will output a list of the top 10 largest files in the specified directory, showing their names, full paths, and sizes in megabytes."
