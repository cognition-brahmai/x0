        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a hospital emergency department that handles 500 patients per day, with a peak hour where they see 60 patients. Each patient needs about 30 minutes of care from medical staff. The hospital wants to reduce waiting times by adding more doctors and nurses during these busy hours. We need to figure out how many extra staff members they need to meet this goal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's currently happening and what needs to change. The main issue is waiting times during peak hours. So, probably, during those times, there aren't enough staff to handle the number of patients coming in, leading to queues and longer wait times.\n\nTo solve this, we need to calculate the current capacity of the ED in terms of how many patients can be seen per hour, and then compare that to the demand during peak hours. The difference will tell us how much additional capacity is needed, which we can translate into the number of extra staff required.\n\nLet's start by figuring out the current capacity. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many doctors and nurses are currently working in the ED. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the existing staff numbers, it's hard to calculate the additional needed.\n\nMaybe I can approach this differently. Perhaps I can calculate the total staff required to handle the peak hour volume and then suggest that's how many they need in total during those hours. Then, by subtracting the current staff numbers (which are unknown), we can find the additional staff needed. But since the current staff numbers aren't provided, maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects me to calculate the total staff required during peak hours based on the patient volume and the time spent per patient, assuming that's the bottleneck.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nDuring the peak hour, there are 60 patients coming in, and each patient needs 30 minutes of care. So, total care time needed is 60 patients * 30 minutes = 1800 minutes.\n\nNow, convert that to hours: 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours.\n\nSo, in total, 30 hours of direct patient care are needed during that one-hour period.\n\nBut, staff don't work just during that one hour; they work 8-hour shifts. However, since we're focusing on the peak hour, we need to ensure that there's enough staff during that specific hour.\n\nAssuming that the staff is present and working during the peak hour, we need to have enough of them to cover the 30 hours of care needed.\n\nEach staff member works an 8-hour shift and spends 75% of their time on direct patient care.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much direct care time one staff member provides per shift.\n\n8 hours * 75% = 6 hours per shift.\n\nBut since we're looking at the peak hour, we need to find out how much direct care time that staff member can provide during that one hour.\n\nIf they work an 8-hour shift and provide 6 hours of direct care in total, then per hour, they provide 6 hours / 8 hours = 0.75 hours per hour.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If they provide 75% of their time in direct care over the entire shift, then during any given hour within that shift, they should also be providing direct care 75% of the time.\n\nSo, per hour, each staff member provides 0.75 hours of direct care.\n\nNow, to cover the 30 hours of direct care needed during the peak hour, we can divide the total care needed by the care provided per staff member per hour.\n\nSo, total staff required = 30 hours / 0.75 hours per staff per hour = 40 staff.\n\nThat means, to handle the peak hour volume, the ED needs 40 staff members present and providing direct care during that hour.\n\nBut, this is the total number needed during the peak hour. If the hospital currently has fewer than 40 staff during that time, then the difference would be the additional staff needed.\n\nHowever, since we don't know the current number of staff, perhaps the expectation is to provide the total number needed, which is 40.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hospital currently has a certain number of staff, and we need to calculate the additional based on that. But since that information isn't provided, I'll assume that the hospital needs to have 40 staff during the peak hour to meet the demand.\n\nWait, but 40 staff seems like a lot. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal care needed: 60 patients * 30 minutes = 1800 minutes, which is 30 hours.\n\nEach staff provides 0.75 hours of direct care per hour.\n\nSo, 30 / 0.75 = 40 staff.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that some staff might be seeing multiple patients overlapping.\n\nFor example, if a staff member spends 30 minutes with a patient, they can see two patients in an hour.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because if a patient needs 30 minutes of care, and the staff spends 75% of their time on direct care, which is 0.75 hours per hour, then the number of patients a staff can see in an hour is 0.75 hours / 0.5 hours per patient = 1.5 patients per hour.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because you can't see half a patient.\n\nLet me rephrase.\n\nEach staff provides 0.75 hours of direct care per hour.\n\nEach patient requires 0.5 hours of care.\n\nTherefore, number of patients per staff per hour = 0.75 / 0.5 = 1.5 patients.\n\nSo, one staff can handle 1.5 patients in an hour.\n\nDuring the peak hour, there are 60 patients.\n\nSo, total staff needed = 60 patients / 1.5 patients per staff = 40 staff.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs 40 staff during the peak hour to handle the patient volume without queues.\n\nNow, if the hospital currently has fewer than 40 staff during that time, the difference would be the additional staff needed.\n\nBut since the current number isn't specified, perhaps the answer should be that the hospital needs to have at least 40 staff during the peak hour.\n\nAlternatively, if the hospital currently has a certain number, say X, then the additional needed would be 40 - X.\n\nBut without knowing X, I can't specify the additional number.\n\nMaybe the problem expects me to calculate the total staff needed, which is 40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's more information needed to provide a precise answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire day's volume to determine the staff required.\n\nThe ED sees 500 patients per day, with a peak hour of 60 patients.\n\nPerhaps the 500 patients per day is to give context to the overall operation, but the focus is on the peak hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hospital operates 24/7, and staff work 8-hour shifts, so I need to consider how many shifts are needed to cover the entire day, but again, focusing on the peak hour.\n\nI think the key is to ensure that during the peak hour, there are enough staff to handle the demand.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of staff required during that hour is 40.\n\nIf the hospital wants to reduce waiting times, they need to have at least that many staff during the peak hour.\n\nSo, the answer is that the hospital needs to have at least 40 staff during the peak hour.\n\nIf they have fewer than that, they need to hire additional staff to make up the difference.\n\nFor example, if they currently have 30 staff during the peak hour, they would need an additional 10 staff to reach the required 40.\n\nBut since the current number isn't specified, I can't give a specific number of additional staff needed.\n\nPerhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the total staff needed during the peak hour, which is 40.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the calculation.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nLet's calculate the required staff based on the patient arrival rate and the service time.\n\nThis sounds like a queuing theory problem, where we have to balance the arrival rate with the service rate to minimize waiting times.\n\nIn queuing theory, the service rate should be higher than the arrival rate to avoid infinite queues.\n\nThe arrival rate during the peak hour is 60 patients per hour.\n\nEach staff can serve 1 patient every 30 minutes, which is 2 patients per hour.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that each staff can handle 1.5 patients per hour.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nWait, there's confusion here.\n\nEach staff works 8 hours a day, spends 75% of their time on direct care, which is 6 hours out of 8.\n\nSo, per hour, they spend 0.75 hours on direct care.\n\nEach patient requires 0.5 hours of care.\n\nTherefore, number of patients per staff per hour is 0.75 / 0.5 = 1.5 patients.\n\nSo, the service rate per staff is 1.5 patients per hour.\n\nThe arrival rate is 60 patients per hour.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of staff needed, we divide the arrival rate by the service rate per staff.\n\nStaff needed = arrival rate / service rate per staff = 60 / 1.5 = 40 staff.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that each staff can serve 1.5 patients per hour, then for 60 patients, we need 60 / 1.5 = 40 staff.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to have at least 40 staff during the peak hour to handle the patient volume without queues.\n\nIf they have fewer staff, waiting times will increase.\n\nSo, the minimum number of additional staff required would be the difference between 40 and the current number of staff during the peak hour.\n\nBut since the current number isn't specified, I can't provide a specific number for additional staff.\n\nPerhaps the expectation is to state that the hospital needs to have at least 40 staff during the peak hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's more information needed to provide a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire shift and how many staff are needed throughout the day, but the focus is on the peak hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hospital wants to have some buffer to account for variability in arrival rates or service times.\n\nIn that case, they might need more than the minimum required.\n\nBut without specific instructions, I'll stick with the minimum required, which is 40 staff during the peak hour.\n\nIn conclusion, the hospital needs to have at least 40 staff during the peak hour to handle the patient volume and reduce waiting times.\n\nIf they currently have fewer than 40 staff during that time, they need to hire additional staff to make up the difference.\n\nFor example, if they have 30 staff currently, they would need an additional 10 staff.\n\nBut since the current number isn't specified, I can't give a specific number for additional staff needed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the hospital needs to have at least 40 staff during the peak hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
