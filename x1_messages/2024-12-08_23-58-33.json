        "content": "Let's see. The company produces 500 units every day, and each unit costs $15 to produce. They sell each unit for $30. To find the daily profit, I need to calculate the total revenue from sales and subtract the total production costs.\n\nFirst, the total revenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. So, that would be 500 units times $30 per unit.\n\nTotal Revenue = 500 units * $30/unit = $15,000\n\nNext, the total production cost is the number of units produced multiplied by the production cost per unit. So, that's 500 units times $15 per unit.\n\nTotal Production Cost = 500 units * $15/unit = $7,500\n\nNow, the daily profit is the total revenue minus the total production cost.\n\nDaily Profit = Total Revenue - Total Production Cost = $15,000 - $7,500 = $7,500\n\nSo, the company's daily profit is $7,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7500} \\]"
