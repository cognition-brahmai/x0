        "content": "Let's see. The train travels 100 miles in 2 hours. In the first hour, it's going at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. So, in that first hour, it covers 40 miles. That means, in the second hour, it has to cover the remaining distance to make up the total of 100 miles.\n\nSo, the remaining distance is 100 miles minus the 40 miles it already covered in the first hour, which is 60 miles. And this has to be covered in the second hour.\n\nSince it's traveling at a constant speed during the second hour as well, the speed would be the distance divided by the time. Here, the distance is 60 miles and the time is 1 hour. So, the speed during the second hour is 60 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Total distance is 100 miles, time is 2 hours. First hour, speed is 40 mph, so distance covered is 40 miles. Remaining distance is 100 - 40 = 60 miles. Since it has to cover 60 miles in the second hour, the speed must be 60 mph.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
