        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, John is reading a book from page 1 to page 250. He reads an even number of pages every day except for the last day, when he reads an odd number of pages. We need to find the minimum number of days it took him to read the book.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to minimize the number of days, meaning we want John to read as many pages as possible each day, except for the last day, when he reads an odd number of pages.\n\nSince he reads an even number of pages every day except the last, which is odd, we can think of the total pages as the sum of several even numbers plus one odd number.\n\nLet's recall that the sum of even numbers is even, and adding an odd number makes the total sum odd. Indeed, 250 is even, but wait, the total pages are from 1 to 250, which is 250 pages. So, the sum should be 250, which is even.\n\nBut hold on, the sum of pages read each day should add up to 250. If he reads even pages every day except the last day, which is odd, then the total would be even plus odd, which is odd. But 250 is even. This seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the sum with the number of pages read each day. Let's clarify.\n\nEach day, except the last, he reads an even number of pages, and the last day he reads an odd number of pages. The sum of all pages read each day should equal 250.\n\nSo, total pages = sum of (even + even + ... + even + odd) = even + odd = odd.\n\nBut 250 is even. This suggests there's a problem with the initial assumption.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nLet's consider that the number of pages read per day is what's even or odd, not the sum of pages.\n\nSo, if he reads even pages for all days except the last, which is odd, and the total is 250, which is even.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the possible number of days.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of days as n.\n\nThen, total pages = p1 + p2 + ... + pn, where p1 to p(n-1) are even, and pn is odd.\n\nSince even + even + ... + even + odd = odd.\n\nBut 250 is even. This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps the total pages are considered differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the number of pages read per day, not the sum.\n\nWait, no, it's about the total pages read over multiple days, with the last day being odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that John reads a certain even number of pages each day, except the last day, which is odd.\n\nWe need to minimize the number of days, so we should maximize the number of pages read per day.\n\nThe maximum even number less than or equal to 250 is 250 itself.\n\nBut if he reads 250 pages in one day, which is even, but the last day should be odd.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nNext, consider two days.\n\nFirst day: even number of pages, say 248 (which is even), last day: 2 pages (which is even), but the last day must be odd.\n\nSo, 248 + 2 = 250, but last day is even, which violates the condition.\n\nAlternatively, first day 249 (odd), last day 1 (odd), but the first day should be even except the last day.\n\nWait, no. Only the last day is odd, the preceding days are even.\n\nSo, in two days: day 1 even, day 2 odd.\n\nLet\u2019s choose day 1 as 248 (even), day 2 as 2 (even), but 2 is even, not odd.\n\nSo, to make day 2 odd, let's set day 1 as 249 (which is odd), day 2 as 1 (odd). But this violates the condition that only the last day is odd.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that he reads an even number of pages every day except the last day, which is odd.\n\nSo, in two days: day 1 even, day 2 odd.\n\nSo, day 1: 248 (even), day 2: 2 (even), but need day 2 to be odd.\n\nSo, day 1: 248, day 2: 2, but 2 is even. To make day 2 odd, we can set day 2 to 1, then day 1 would be 249, which is odd, but that violates the condition that only the last day is odd.\n\nWait, this is tricky.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the sum of pages read each day, with all but the last day being even, and the last day being odd, equals 250.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the pages read on the last day as an odd number, say o.\n\nThen, the sum of pages read on the previous days is 250 - o, which must be even, since the sum of even numbers is even.\n\nSo, 250 - o is even, which implies that o is even, because 250 is even, and even - even = even.\n\nBut o is odd, which creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, it seems impossible to have such a reading schedule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet\u2019s think about smaller examples to see the pattern.\n\nSuppose the total pages are 5.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\n- Day 1: 4 (even), Day 2: 1 (odd). Total: 5.\n\n- Day 1: 2 (even), Day 2: 3 (odd). Total: 5.\n\nBoth satisfy the condition.\n\nAnother example: total pages = 4.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\n- Day 1: 2 (even), Day 2: 2 (even). But the last day must be odd, which it's not.\n\n- Day 1: 3 (odd), Day 2: 1 (odd). But only the last day can be odd.\n\nWait, this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, day 1: 2, day 2: 2. But day 2 is even, which violates the condition that the last day must be odd.\n\nSo, for total pages = 4, it's impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for total pages = 3:\n\n- Day 1: 2 (even), Day 2: 1 (odd). Total: 3.\n\nThis works.\n\nFor total pages = 2:\n\n- Day 1: 2 (even), but the last day must be odd. So, not possible.\n\nFor total pages = 1:\n\n- Day 1: 1 (odd). This works, but it's just one day, which is odd.\n\nWait, the condition says that he reads an even number of pages every day except the last day, when he reads an odd number of pages.\n\nIf there's only one day, it's odd, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, for total pages = 1, it takes 1 day.\n\nFor total pages = 2, it's impossible because if he reads 2 on day 1, which is even, but the last day must be odd.\n\nAlternatively, he can't read 1 on day 1 (odd) and then another day, because the total is 2, which wouldn't work.\n\nSo, total pages = 2 cannot be achieved.\n\nTotal pages = 3 can be achieved in 2 days: day 1 (2 even), day 2 (1 odd).\n\nTotal pages = 4 cannot be achieved.\n\nTotal pages = 5 can be achieved: day 1 (4 even), day 2 (1 odd).\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that for total pages = 4, it's impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps when the total number of pages is even, it's impossible to achieve this reading pattern.\n\nBut in the problem, the total pages are 250, which is even.\n\nFrom the small examples, it seems that when the total is even, it's impossible to have the sum of even pages (for all but the last day) plus an odd page (last day) equal to an even number.\n\nBecause even + odd = odd, but 250 is even.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way around this.\n\nWait, maybe if he reads more than two days.\n\nLet\u2019s consider three days.\n\nSuppose day 1: even, day 2: even, day 3: odd.\n\nThen, total = even + even + odd = even + odd = odd.\n\nBut 250 is even, which again creates a contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, for four days: even + even + even + odd = even + odd = odd.\n\nStill not matching 250, which is even.\n\nWait, this pattern suggests that no matter how many days he takes, as long as there is one odd day (the last day), the total will always be odd.\n\nBut 250 is even, so it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution; it's impossible for John to read from page 1 to page 250 under these conditions.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet\u2019s think differently.\n\nSuppose he reads an even number of pages every day except the last day, which is odd.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of days as n.\n\nThen, total pages = p1 + p2 + ... + pn, where p1 to p(n-1) are even, and pn is odd.\n\nSum = even + even + ... + even + odd = even + odd = odd.\n\nBut 250 is even.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction, as odd does not equal even.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for more flexibility.\n\nWait, perhaps the last day can be even if it's the only day.\n\nBut the problem says that he reads an even number of pages every day except the last day, when he reads an odd number of pages.\n\nSo, if there's only one day, it's odd.\n\nIf there are multiple days, the last day is odd, and the preceding days are even.\n\nIn the case of one day, it's odd, which would work for odd totals, but not for even totals like 250.\n\nSo, for even totals, he needs multiple days, but as we've seen, the sum would be odd, which doesn't match the even total.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible.\n\nHence, the answer is that it cannot be done.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{impossible}} \\]"
