Hmm, I need to figure out who finishes third.\n\nFirst, I should understand what alphabetical order means. Alphabetical order is when things are arranged based on the alphabet, from A to Z. So, for names, it would be sorted based on the first letter, then the second, and so on.\n\nGiven that, let's list the names: Alice, Bob, and Carol.\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\n- Alice (A)\n\n- Bob (B)\n\n- Carol (C)\n\nSo, Alice comes first, then Bob, then Carol.\n\nBut the problem states that Alice finishes before Bob, and Bob finishes before Carol. That seems to match the alphabetical order already.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"if the racers finish in alphabetical order, who finishes third?\" So, if they finish in alphabetical order, then Alice finishes first, Bob finishes second, and Carol finishes third.\n\nTherefore, Carol finishes third.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nLet's see: Alice finishes before Bob, and Bob finishes before Carol. So, the order is Alice, Bob, Carol.\n\nIf they finish in alphabetical order, which is also Alice, Bob, Carol, then indeed, Carol finishes third.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Carol}} \\]"
