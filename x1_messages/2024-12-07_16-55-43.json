        "content": "So you want to find the Taylor series expansion of f(x) = ln(x) about x=1. Taylor series is a way to express a function as a sum of terms calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point. In this case, the point is x=1.\n\nFirst, let's recall the general formula for a Taylor series expansion of a function f(x) about a point x=a:\n\nf(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + [f''(a)(x-a)^2]/2! + [f'''(a)(x-a)^3]/3! + ... \n\nSo, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) = ln(x) evaluated at x=1.\n\nLet's start by finding the derivatives of f(x):\n\nf(x) = ln(x)\n\nf'(x) = 1/x\n\nf''(x) = -1/x^2\n\nf'''(x) = 2/x^3\n\nf''''(x) = -6/x^4\n\nand so on.\n\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at x=1:\n\nf(1) = ln(1) = 0\n\nf'(1) = 1/1 = 1\n\nf''(1) = -1/1^2 = -1\n\nf'''(1) = 2/1^3 = 2\n\nf''''(1) = -6/1^4 = -6\n\nWe can see a pattern here. The nth derivative of f(x) at x=1 is (-1)^(n+1) * (n-1)! for n >= 1.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the Taylor series formula:\n\nf(x) = 0 + 1*(x-1) + [(-1)(x-1)^2]/2! + [2(x-1)^3]/3! + [(-6)(x-1)^4]/4! + ...\n\nSimplifying this:\n\nf(x) = (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - (x-1)^4/4 + ... \n\nSo, the Taylor series expansion of ln(x) about x=1 is:\n\nln(x) = \u2211 [ (-1)^(n+1) * (x-1)^n ] / n   for n=1 to infinity\n\nThis is an alternating series, which is valid for x in the interval (0,2].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
