One such fact is that plants have the ability to adapt to their environment over time. This adaptation can be seen in various ways, such as developing deeper roots in search of water, changing leaf structures to maximize sunlight absorption, or even altering flowering times based on seasonal changes. Gardeners often observe and work with these natural adaptations to help their plants thrive in specific conditions."
