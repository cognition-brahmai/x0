        "content": "So the water tank is full and holds 250 gallons. If the faucet releases water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, I need to find out how long it will take to empty half of the tank.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what half of the tank is in gallons. Since the full tank is 250 gallons, half of that would be:\n\n250 gallons / 2 = 125 gallons\n\nSo, I need to find out how long it takes to release 125 gallons at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.\n\nTo find the time, I can use the formula:\n\ntime = amount / rate\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\ntime = 125 gallons / 4 gallons per minute\n\ntime = 31.25 minutes\n\nSo, it will take 31.25 minutes to empty half of the tank.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check that. If the faucet releases 4 gallons every minute, then in 31 minutes, it would release:\n\n4 gallons/minute * 31 minutes = 124 gallons\n\nAnd in the next 0.25 minute, it would release:\n\n4 gallons/minute * 0.25 minute = 1 gallon\n\nSo, total water released would be 124 + 1 = 125 gallons, which is half the tank.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the whole tank. If it takes a certain amount of time to empty the entire tank, then half the tank would take half that time.\n\nFirst, find the time to empty the full tank:\n\ntime = 250 gallons / 4 gallons per minute = 62.5 minutes\n\nTherefore, half the tank would take:\n\n62.5 minutes / 2 = 31.25 minutes\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 31.25 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I can think about it in terms of rates. The faucet is releasing water at a constant rate of 4 gallons per minute, so the amount of water released is directly proportional to the time it's been running.\n\nSo, amount released = rate * time\n\nWe know the amount we want to release is 125 gallons, and the rate is 4 gallons per minute, so:\n\n125 = 4 * time\n\nSolving for time:\n\ntime = 125 / 4 = 31.25 minutes\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that it will take 31.25 minutes to empty half of the tank.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31.25} \\]"
