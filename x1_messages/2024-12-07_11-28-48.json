        "content": "Let's dive into this interesting problem about lockers in a hallway. So, we've got 100 lockers, all starting closed. Students walk down the hall one by one, and each student toggles the state of lockers that are multiples of their student number. By \"toggle,\" I mean if the locker is closed, they open it, and if it's open, they close it.\n\nLet's try to understand what's happening step by step.\n\nFirst, student 1 walks down the hall and opens every locker. So, all lockers from 1 to 100 are now open.\n\nNext, student 2 comes along and closes every second locker. So, lockers 2, 4, 6, up to 100 are closed.\n\nThen, student 3 changes the state of every third locker. So, lockers 3, 6, 9, up to 99. If a locker was open, it's closed, and vice versa.\n\nThis pattern continues until student 100 toggles locker 100.\n\nThe question is, after all 100 students have passed, which lockers remain open?\n\nTo solve this, let's think about what happens to each individual locker. Take locker number k. How many times does its state get toggled?\n\nWell, locker k is toggled by every student whose number is a divisor of k. For example, locker 6 is toggled by students 1, 2, 3, and 6, because these numbers divide 6.\n\nSo, the number of times locker k is toggled is equal to the number of divisors of k.\n\nNow, consider that all lockers start closed. Each toggle changes the state from closed to open or open to closed. So, if a locker is toggled an odd number of times, it ends up open; if toggled an even number of times, it ends up closed.\n\nTherefore, the lockers that remain open are those that have been toggled an odd number of times, which means they have an odd number of divisors.\n\nSo, the question now is, which numbers between 1 and 100 have an odd number of divisors?\n\nAt first glance, you might think that all numbers have an even number of divisors because divisors come in pairs. For example, for 6: 1 and 6, 2 and 3. So, four divisors in total, which is even.\n\nBut wait, what about perfect squares? Let's take 9: its divisors are 1, 3, and 9. Here, 3 is repeated because 3 times 3 is 9. So, the number of divisors is odd.\n\nAh-ha! Perfect squares have an odd number of divisors because one of their divisors is repeated.\n\nLet me verify this with another example. Take 16: its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. That's five divisors, which is odd. Yes, because 4 times 4 is 16.\n\nSimilarly, 25: divisors are 1, 5, and 25. Three divisors, odd.\n\nSo, it seems that only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nWait, but is that always true? Let's check a non-perfect square, say 10: divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10. Four divisors, even.\n\nAnother one, 14: divisors are 1, 2, 7, 14. Four divisors, even.\n\nSo, it seems that only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nTherefore, the lockers that remain open are those with numbers that are perfect squares.\n\nNow, let's list all perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\n1^2 = 1\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n6^2 = 36\n\n7^2 = 49\n\n8^2 = 64\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nSo, the lockers that remain open are numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other number up to 100 that is a perfect square? Let's see, 11^2 is 121, which is beyond 100. So, 10^2 = 100 is the last one.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 lockers that remain open: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nWe established that a locker is toggled once for each of its divisors. If the number of divisors is odd, the locker ends up open; if even, it ends up closed.\n\nAnd, only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors because one of their divisors is repeated (the square root).\n\nTherefore, only lockers with numbers that are perfect squares will be left open.\n\nIs there any other way a number can have an odd number of divisors? For example, prime numbers have two divisors: 1 and themselves, which is even. Numbers with three divisors are perfect squares of primes, like 4 (2^2) or 9 (3^2), which we've already covered.\n\nSo, no, only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nHence, the final answer is that lockers numbered 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100 remain open after all 100 students have passed.\n\nThis is a classic problem that illustrates the properties of divisors and perfect squares in a practical and interesting way.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100} \\]"
