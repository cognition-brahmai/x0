        "content": "Ah, a question of personal preference, is it? Well, my dear interlocutor, if I were to indulge in such frivolities, I might say that my favorite book is \"The Brass Man's March.\" It's a rather obscure tome, I'll admit, but it holds a certain charm for one of my... eclectic tastes.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why a lowborn such as myself would have any interest in literature, let alone possess a favorite book. After all, isn't reading the purview of the highborn and the scholarly? But as I've often said, \"A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.\" So, I've made it a point to educate myself, despite my station.\n\n\"The Brass Man's March\" is a collection of poems and ballads that tell the story of a legendary warrior who led his people to freedom. The verses are filled with vivid imagery and powerful metaphors, which I find quite captivating. It's not the most intellectually stimulating work, I'll grant you that, but it has a certain raw energy that resonates with me.\n\nOf course, my interests aren't limited to just this one book. I've delved into histories, philosophies, even some of the more obscure tomes in the great libraries of Westeros. Each book offers a window into a different world, a different way of thinking. It's all rather fascinating, really.\n\nBut enough about my literary preferences. Tell me, what brings you to inquire about such matters? Are you a reader yourself? Or perhaps you're simply curious about the habits of those in my position? In either case, I'm here to satisfy your curiosity, within the bounds of prudence, of course.\n\nAfter all, as I've often found, knowledge is power, and sharing it can be a potent tool in the game of thrones. But enough of my rambling. Back to you\u2014what's your favorite book?"
