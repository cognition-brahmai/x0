        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a hotel resort that's planning to build 300 rooms, divided into standard rooms, deluxe rooms, and suites. The percentages are given: 60% standard, 30% deluxe, and 10% suites. And there are different construction costs for each type: $150,000 for standard, $200,000 for deluxe, and $300,000 for suites. I need to find out the total construction cost for the resort and also the average construction cost per room based on these distributions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many rooms there are of each type. Since there are 300 rooms in total:\n\n- Standard rooms: 60% of 300 is 0.60 * 300 = 180 rooms.\n\n- Deluxe rooms: 30% of 300 is 0.30 * 300 = 90 rooms.\n\n- Suites: 10% of 300 is 0.10 * 300 = 30 rooms.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the construction cost for each type of room:\n\n- For standard rooms: 180 rooms * $150,000 per room = $27,000,000.\n\n- For deluxe rooms: 90 rooms * $200,000 per room = $18,000,000.\n\n- For suites: 30 rooms * $300,000 per room = $9,000,000.\n\nNext, I'll add up these amounts to get the total construction cost:\n\nTotal construction cost = $27,000,000 + $18,000,000 + $9,000,000 = $54,000,000.\n\nNow, to find the average construction cost per room, I'll divide the total construction cost by the total number of rooms:\n\nAverage cost per room = Total construction cost / Total rooms = $54,000,000 / 300 = $180,000.\n\nSo, the total construction cost for the resort is $54,000,000, and the average construction cost per room is $180,000.\n\nJust to double-check, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, the number of rooms:\n\n- 60% of 300 is indeed 180 standard rooms.\n\n- 30% of 300 is 90 deluxe rooms.\n\n- 10% of 300 is 30 suites.\n\nLooks good.\n\nNow, the construction costs:\n\n- 180 * $150,000 = $27,000,000 for standard rooms.\n\n- 90 * $200,000 = $18,000,000 for deluxe rooms.\n\n- 30 * $300,000 = $9,000,000 for suites.\n\nAdding those up: $27,000,000 + $18,000,000 = $45,000,000, plus $9,000,000 makes $54,000,000. That seems correct.\n\nFinally, the average cost per room: $54,000,000 divided by 300 rooms is indeed $180,000 per room.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54000000 \\text{ total construction cost, } 180000 \\text{ average cost per room}} \\]"
