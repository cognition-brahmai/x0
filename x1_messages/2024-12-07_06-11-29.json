        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store selling apples and oranges. Apples are $1 each, and oranges are $2 each. A customer buys a total of 12 fruits and spends $18. We need to find out how many apples and how many oranges they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the number of oranges.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 12.\n\n2. The total cost is $18.\n\nSo, we can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nThe first equation will be for the total number of fruits:\n\n\\[ a + o = 12 \\]\n\nThe second equation will be for the total cost:\n\n\\[ 1a + 2o = 18 \\]\n\nSimplifying the cost equation:\n\n\\[ a + 2o = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 12 \\)\n\n2. \\( a + 2o = 18 \\)\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be straightforward here.\n\nLet\u2019s subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ (a + 2o) - (a + o) = 18 - 12 \\]\n\n\\[ a + 2o - a - o = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ o = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the number of oranges is 6.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the first equation to find \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a + 6 = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ a = 12 - 6 \\]\n\n\\[ a = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 6 apples and 6 oranges.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it adds up.\n\nIf they bought 6 apples at $1 each, that's \\( 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\) dollars.\n\nThey bought 6 oranges at $2 each, that's \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) dollars.\n\nAdding those up: \\( 6 + 12 = 18 \\) dollars, which matches the total spent.\n\nAlso, the total number of fruits is \\( 6 + 6 = 12 \\), which also matches.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nSuppose we assume all 12 fruits are apples. That would cost \\( 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\) dollars. But the customer spent $18, which is $6 more than $12.\n\nSince each orange costs $1 more than an apple, to make up the additional $6, the customer must have bought 6 oranges instead of apples.\n\nTherefore, 6 apples and 6 oranges.\n\nWait, but this is the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about it in terms of averages.\n\nThe average cost per fruit is \\( \\frac{18}{12} = 1.5 \\) dollars per fruit.\n\nSince apples are $1 and oranges are $2, the average suggests a mix right in the middle, which again points to equal numbers of apples and oranges.\n\nSo, 6 apples and 6 oranges.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the concept of weighted averages or even think about it graphically, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAnother way is to consider the difference in cost.\n\nIf all fruits were apples, the cost would be $12.\n\nFor each orange replaces an apple, the cost increases by $1.\n\nTo reach $18, we need to replace 6 apples with oranges.\n\nThus, 6 apples and 6 oranges.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 6 apples and 6 oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ apples and } 6 \\text{ oranges}} \\]"
