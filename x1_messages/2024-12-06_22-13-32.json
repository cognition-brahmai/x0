The monarchy was abolished, and the country's political structure shifted from an absolute monarchy to a republic. The revolution was driven by widespread economic hardship, social inequality, and a growing discontent with the monarchy. It led to significant changes in the country's social structure, including the rise of secularism and nationalism.\n\nWhat was a significant societal change that resulted from the French Revolution?\n\nA. The establishment of a constitutional monarchy\n\nB. The abolition of feudalism\n\nC. The establishment of the Catholic Church as the state religion\n\nD. The rise of secularism and nationalism\n\nSo, I need to pick one significant societal change that came out of the French Revolution from these options. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. The establishment of a constitutional monarchy: Actually, the French Revolution started with the hope of creating a constitutional monarchy, where the king's powers were limited by a constitution. This was similar to what happened in Britain. However, things escalated, and the monarchy was eventually abolished, leading to the execution of King Louis XVI. So, while there was an initial move towards a constitutional monarchy, it didn't last, and the revolution went much further. Therefore, I'm not sure if this is the most significant societal change.\n\nB. The abolition of feudalism: In August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly passed the \"Abolition of Feudal Rights\" which effectively ended feudalism in France. This was a massive change because feudalism had been the foundation of French society for centuries. It meant the end of privileges for the nobility and the clergy, and the establishment of equality before the law. This was a profound societal shift, as it dismantled the traditional social hierarchy and paved the way for a more egalitarian society.\n\nC. The establishment of the Catholic Church as the state religion: Actually, during the French Revolution, there was a movement away from the Catholic Church's influence over the state. The revolutionaries wanted to reduce the power of the Church and establish a more secular state. They nationalized Church properties, created a new civil constitution for the clergy, and even promoted a new state religion in the form of the Cult of Reason and later the Cult of the Supreme Being. So, this option seems incorrect because the revolution moved away from establishing the Catholic Church as the state religion.\n\nD. The rise of secularism and nationalism: This seems very pertinent. The French Revolution is often credited with giving birth to modern secularism and nationalism. Secularism because the revolution separated church and state, reducing the influence of the Catholic Church in public life. Nationalism because it fostered a sense of national identity and sovereignty, independent of the monarchy and the Church. These ideologies have had a lasting impact on French and world history.\n\nConsidering all this, both options B and D seem significant. However, the question asks for \"a significant societal change,\" implying that I should pick one. Maybe I should think about which one is more fundamental or had a broader impact.\n\nThe abolition of feudalism (option B) was certainly a major event that changed the social and economic structure of France fundamentally. It freed the peasantry from feudal obligations and moved the country towards a more capitalist economy.\n\nOn the other hand, the rise of secularism and nationalism (option D) had profound effects on politics and culture, not just in France but across Europe and beyond. These ideologies shaped modern nation-states and influenced political thought for centuries.\n\nHmm, it's tough to choose between B and D. Maybe I should consider the context of the question. The prompt mentions that \"It led to significant changes in the country's social structure, including the rise of secularism and nationalism.\" So, perhaps the question is hinting at D as the answer.\n\nBut option B is also a social change, and arguably, the abolition of feudalism was a more immediate and drastic change in people's daily lives.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the answer is both B and D, but since I have to pick one, perhaps I should choose the one that is not directly listed as an answer, meaning that the significant change is the rise of secularism and nationalism.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the abolition of feudalism led to the rise of secularism and nationalism, making D the ultimate outcome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the abolition of feudalism is more of a political and economic change, while the rise of secularism and nationalism is more of a cultural and ideological change. Both are significant, but perhaps the question is focusing on the ideological shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option A is a trap because although there was an initial move towards a constitutional monarchy, it didn't last, and the monarchy was abolished later on.\n\nOption C is definitely incorrect because the revolution moved away from the Catholic Church's influence, not towards it.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best answer is D: The rise of secularism and nationalism. This seems to capture the broader ideological shift that occurred during and after the French Revolution, which has had lasting impacts on French and world society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
