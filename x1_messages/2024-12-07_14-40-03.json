        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a farmer who has both chickens and rabbits on his farm. He counted a total of 60 heads and 174 legs. We need to figure out how many chickens and how many rabbits there are.\n\nFirst, I think I should define what I know about chickens and rabbits. Chickens have 1 head and 2 legs each, right? And rabbits have 1 head and 4 legs each. So, no matter whether it's a chicken or a rabbit, each one has one head. But their leg counts differ.\n\nGiven that, the total number of heads is 60. Since each animal has one head, that means there are 60 animals in total, both chickens and rabbits combined.\n\nNow, the total number of legs is 174. Chickens have 2 legs each, and rabbits have 4 legs each. If I let\u2019s say, the number of chickens is C and the number of rabbits is R, then I can set up some equations based on that.\n\nFirst equation would be for the heads:\n\nC + R = 60\n\nBecause the total number of animals is 60.\n\nThe second equation would be for the legs:\n\n2C + 4R = 174\n\nBecause chickens have 2 legs and rabbits have 4 legs, and together they have 174 legs.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I need to solve for C and R.\n\nI can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:\n\nC + 2R = 87\n\nNow, I have:\n\n1) C + R = 60\n\n2) C + 2R = 87\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second one to eliminate C:\n\n(C + 2R) - (C + R) = 87 - 60\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nC + 2R - C - R = 27\n\nSo, R = 27\n\nAlright, so there are 27 rabbits.\n\nNow, plug that back into the first equation to find C:\n\nC + 27 = 60\n\nC = 60 - 27\n\nC = 33\n\nSo, there are 33 chickens and 27 rabbits.\n\nBut, I should check if this makes sense. Let's verify the leg count.\n\n33 chickens x 2 legs = 66 legs\n\n27 rabbits x 4 legs = 108 legs\n\nTotal legs: 66 + 108 = 174 legs, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, the head count is 33 + 27 = 60 heads, which also matches.\n\nSo, the answer should be 33 chickens and 27 rabbits.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using averages or something else.\n\nSuppose all 60 animals were chickens. Then, there would be 60 x 2 = 120 legs.\n\nBut actually, there are 174 legs, which is 174 - 120 = 54 legs more than if all were chickens.\n\nEach rabbit has 2 more legs than a chicken (4 - 2 = 2).\n\nSo, the number of rabbits is 54 / 2 = 27 rabbits.\n\nThen, the number of chickens is 60 - 27 = 33 chickens.\n\nThat\u2019s the same answer I got earlier, just a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, if all 60 animals were rabbits, there would be 60 x 4 = 240 legs.\n\nBut actually, there are 174 legs, which is 240 - 174 = 66 legs extra.\n\nEach chicken has 2 less legs than a rabbit (4 - 2 = 2).\n\nSo, the number of chickens is 66 / 2 = 33 chickens.\n\nThen, the number of rabbits is 60 - 33 = 27 rabbits.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 33 chickens and 27 rabbits.\n\nI think that\u2019s the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33 \\text{ chickens and } 27 \\text{ rabbits}} \\]"
