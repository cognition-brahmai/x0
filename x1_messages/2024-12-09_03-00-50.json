        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Go program that reads a list of integers from standard input and sorts them using the Bubble Sort algorithm. Then, I need to print the sorted list. I'm not super familiar with Go, but I've done some programming in other languages, so I should be able to figure this out.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what Bubble Sort is. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. It's not the most efficient for large lists, but it's straightforward to implement, which is probably why it's chosen for this task.\n\nOkay, so in Go, I need to read integers from standard input. I'm assuming the integers are separated by spaces or maybe newlines. I should make sure to handle both possibilities, but for simplicity, let's assume they're separated by spaces.\n\nI need to read the input, parse it into integers, store them in a slice (which is like an array in Go, but dynamic), and then apply the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the slice.\n\nLet me think about how to read from standard input in Go. I recall that in Go, you can use the \"bufio\" package to read from standard input efficiently. So, I'll need to import \"bufio\" and \"os\" for that.\n\nOnce I have the input, I need to split it into tokens based on spaces and convert each token to an integer. I should handle any errors that might occur during parsing, like if the input contains non-numeric values.\n\nAfter that, I need to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm. I need to loop through the slice multiple times, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they're in the wrong order.\n\nFinally, after sorting, I need to print the sorted list. I can use a loop to iterate through the slice and print each element, separated by spaces.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read input from standard input.\n\n2. Split the input into tokens based on spaces.\n\n3. Convert each token to an integer.\n\n4. Store the integers in a slice.\n\n5. Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the slice.\n\n6. Print the sorted slice.\n\nI should also think about edge cases, like an empty list or a list with one element. Bubble Sort should handle those correctly without any issues.\n\nAlright, let's start writing some code. First, I'll set up the basic structure of the program, including importing the necessary packages.\n\nI need \"fmt\" for printing, \"bufio\" and \"os\" for reading input, and \"strconv\" for converting strings to integers.\n\nSo, my imports will look like this:\n\nimport (\n\n \"bufio\"\n\n \"os\"\n\n \"strconv\"\n\n \"fmt\"\n\n)\n\nNext, I'll create a main function, which is the entry point of the program.\n\nfunc main() {\n\n // Code goes here\n\n}\n\nNow, I need to read from standard input. I'll use bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin) to create a reader.\n\nreader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)\n\nThen, I'll read a line from standard input using reader.ReadString('\\n'). This will read until it finds a newline character.\n\ninput, err := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\nif err != nil {\n\n fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, \"Error reading input:\", err)\n\n return\n\n}\n\nI should handle errors properly, so if there's an error reading input, I'll print an error message to standard error and exit the program.\n\nNext, I need to split the input string into tokens based on spaces. I can use the strings package for that.\n\nI need to import \"strings\", so I'll add that to my imports.\n\nimport (\n\n \"bufio\"\n\n \"os\"\n\n \"strconv\"\n\n \"fmt\"\n\n \"strings\"\n\n)\n\nThen, I'll split the input using strings.Fields(input). This function splits the string based on whitespace and returns a slice of strings.\n\ntokens := strings.Fields(input)\n\nNow, I need to convert each token to an integer. I'll create an empty slice to store the integers.\n\nvar numbers []int\n\nThen, I'll loop through the tokens, convert each one to an integer using strconv.Atoi, and append it to the numbers slice.\n\nfor _, token := range tokens {\n\n num, err := strconv.Atoi(token)\n\n if err != nil {\n\n fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, \"Invalid integer:\", token)\n\n continue\n\n }\n\n numbers = append(numbers, num)\n\n}\n\nHere, if there's an error converting a token to an integer, I'll print an error message and skip that token. This way, the program won't crash if the input contains non-numeric values, but it will warn the user.\n\nNow, I have the list of integers in the numbers slice. Time to implement Bubble Sort.\n\nBubble Sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent items, and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.\n\nIn practice, for simplicity, I can perform n-1 passes for a list of n elements, assuming that in each pass, the largest unsorted element bubbles up to its correct position.\n\nSo, I'll write a function called bubbleSort that takes a slice of integers and sorts it.\n\nfunc bubbleSort(nums []int) {\n\n n := len(nums)\n\n for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {\n\n for j := 0; j < n-1-i; j++ {\n\n if nums[j] > nums[j+1] {\n\n nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]\n\n }\n\n }\n\n }\n\n}\n\nIn this function, I'm iterating from the start of the slice to the end, comparing each pair and swapping if necessary. After each outer loop iteration, the largest unsorted element is in its correct position, so I can reduce the number of comparisons in the next pass.\n\nOnce the sorting is done, I need to print the sorted list. I'll loop through the numbers slice and print each element separated by spaces.\n\nfor _, num := range numbers {\n\n fmt.Printf(\"%d \", num)\n\n}\n\nfmt.Println() // for a newline at the end\n\nAlright, that should be it. Let me put everything together.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\n \"bufio\"\n\n \"os\"\n\n \"strconv\"\n\n \"fmt\"\n\n \"strings\"\n\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)\n\n input, err := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\n if err != nil {\n\n fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, \"Error reading input:\", err)\n\n return\n\n }\n\n tokens := strings.Fields(input)\n\n var numbers []int\n\n for _, token := range tokens {\n\n num, err := strconv.Atoi(token)\n\n if err != nil {\n\n fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, \"Invalid integer:\", token)\n\n continue\n\n }\n\n numbers = append(numbers, num)\n\n }\n\n bubbleSort(numbers)\n\n for _, num := range numbers {\n\n fmt.Printf(\"%d \", num)\n\n }\n\n fmt.Println()\n\n}\n\nfunc bubbleSort(nums []int) {\n\n n := len(nums)\n\n for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {\n\n for j := 0; j < n-1-i; j++ {\n\n if nums[j] > nums[j+1] {\n\n nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]\n\n }\n\n }\n\n }\n\n}\n\nLet me test this code with some input to see if it works.\n\nSuppose the input is: \"3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3\"\n\nAfter sorting, it should be: \"1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 9\"\n\nLet's simulate the Bubble Sort:\n\nFirst pass:\n\n3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3\n\n1 3 1 4 5 2 9 5 3 6 (after first pass, 6 is in its correct position)\n\nSecond pass:\n\n1 1 3 4 2 5 5 3 6 9 (after second pass, 9 is in its correct position)\n\nThird pass:\n\n1 1 3 2 4 5 3 5 6 9\n\nAnd so on, until the list is sorted.\n\nLooks like it should work.\n\nI should also consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty input: should print nothing.\n\n- Single number: should print the same number.\n\n- All numbers same: should print the same list.\n\n- Negative numbers: should handle negatives correctly.\n\n- Non-numeric input: should skip and warn.\n\nAlright, I think this should cover the requirements.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Go program that reads a list of integers from standard input, sorts them using the Bubble Sort algorithm, and then prints the sorted list.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** We use the `bufio` package to read input from standard input efficiently.\n2. **Parsing Input:** The input string is split into tokens based on spaces, and each token is converted to an integer.\n3. **Bubble Sort Algorithm:** We implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the list of integers. This algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n4. **Printing Sorted List:** Finally, we iterate through the sorted slice and print each element.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"bufio\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"strconv\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)\n    input, err := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, \"Error reading input:\", err)\n        return\n    }\n    tokens := strings.Fields(input)\n    var numbers []int\n    for _, token := range tokens {\n        num, err := strconv.Atoi(token)\n        if err != nil {\n            fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, \"Invalid integer:\", token)\n            continue\n        }\n        numbers = append(numbers, num)\n    }\n    bubbleSort(numbers)\n    for _, num := range numbers {\n        fmt.Printf(\"%d \", num)\n    }\n    fmt.Println()\n}\n\nfunc bubbleSort(nums []int) {\n    n := len(nums)\n    for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {\n        for j := 0; j < n-1-i; j++ {\n            if nums[j] > nums[j+1] {\n                nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading and Parsing Input:**\n   - We read the input using `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)`.\n   - The input string is split into tokens based on spaces using `strings.Fields(input)`.\n   - Each token is converted to an integer using `strconv.Atoi(token)`, and invalid tokens are skipped with an error message.\n\n2. **Bubble Sort Implementation:**\n   - We define a function `bubbleSort` that sorts the slice in place.\n   - The function iterates over the slice multiple times, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n   - This process repeats until the slice is sorted.\n\n3. **Printing the Sorted List:**\n   - After sorting, we iterate through the sorted slice and print each element followed by a space.\n   - A final newline is printed for clean output formatting.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program reads, sorts, and prints the list of integers correctly, handling any invalid inputs gracefully."
