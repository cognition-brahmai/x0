        "content": "So, we have three friends who agreed to split the cost of a $60 gift equally. That means each should contribute $20, right? Because $60 divided by 3 is $20.\n\nBut one friend only has $15. So, they're short by $5 ($20 - $15 = $5).\n\nNow, this shortage needs to be covered by the other two friends. So, we need to divide that $5 between the two friends.\n\n$5 divided by 2 is $2.50.\n\nTherefore, each of the remaining two friends needs to contribute an extra $2.50.\n\nSo, instead of paying $20, each of them will pay $22.50.\n\nLet me double-check that:\n\nOne friend pays $15, and the other two pay $22.50 each.\n\nTotal would be $15 + $22.50 + $22.50 = $60.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22.50} \\]"
