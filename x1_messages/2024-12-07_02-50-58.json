        "content": "Let's see... There are 10 birds on a fence, and a hunter shoots one bird, causing all the remaining birds to fly away. So, how many birds are left on the fence?\n\nFirst, there were 10 birds on the fence. One bird is shot, so that removes one bird from the fence. That leaves 9 birds. But then, all the remaining birds fly away because of the shot. So, those 9 birds are no longer on the fence.\n\nTherefore, there are no birds left on the fence.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe the shot bird is still on the fence, dead. The question doesn't specify if the bird falls off or not. If the shot bird remains on the fence, even if dead, then there would be one bird left on the fence.\n\nBut typically, when a bird is shot, it might fall off the fence. However, without specific information, it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps the answer is zero, assuming the shot bird falls off or is removed.\n\nAlternatively, if the shot bird remains on the fence, then there is one bird left.\n\nBut the most logical answer, considering that shot birds don't stay on fences, is probably zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
