        "content": "In sports, an athlete who plays multiple positions in a single game or over the course of a season is often referred to as a \"utility player.\" This term is used across various sports to describe individuals who possess the versatility and skill to excel in different roles on the field or court. For example, in football (soccer), a utility player might be able to play both defense and midfield, while in basketball, a player who can handle point guard duties as well as power forward responsibilities would be considered a utility player. Their adaptability is highly valued by coaches and teams because it provides flexibility in game strategies and can help compensate for injuries or strategic needs."
