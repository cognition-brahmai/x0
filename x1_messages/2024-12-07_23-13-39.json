        "content": "So if a car depreciates by 15% each year, that means every year it's worth 85% of what it was at the beginning of the year. Right? Because 100% minus 15% depreciation is 85%.\n\nSo, after one year, the car is worth 85% of its original value.\n\nAfter two years, it would be 85% of 85%, which is 85% squared.\n\nSimilarly, after five years, it would be 85% to the power of five.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, convert 85% to a decimal: 85% = 0.85.\n\nNow, raise 0.85 to the fifth power: 0.85^5.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n0.85 \u00d7 0.85 = 0.7225\n\n0.7225 \u00d7 0.85 = 0.614125\n\n0.614125 \u00d7 0.85 = 0.52195625\n\n0.52195625 \u00d7 0.85 = 0.44366278125\n\nSo, after five years, the car is worth approximately 44.37% of its original value.\n\nAlternatively, to get a more precise value, I can use a calculator.\n\nLet me check:\n\n0.85 to the power of 5 is 0.4437053125, which is 44.37053125%.\n\nSo, roughly 44.37% of its original value.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{44.37\\%} \\]"
