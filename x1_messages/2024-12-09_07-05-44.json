        "content": "So, if someone is walking at an average speed of 4 miles per hour and they need to cover 12 miles, how long will that take? Hmm, let's see. I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed. In this case, the distance is 12 miles and the speed is 4 miles per hour.\n\nSo, time = 12 miles \u00f7 4 miles per hour. That should give me the time in hours. Let's do the math: 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, it would take 3 hours to walk 12 miles at that speed.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. Is there another way to look at it? Maybe thinking about how much distance is covered in a certain amount of time. For example, at 4 miles per hour, that means every hour, the person walks 4 miles. So, in one hour, 4 miles; in two hours, 8 miles; in three hours, 12 miles. Yeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula: speed equals distance over time, which is s = d/t. If I rearrange that to solve for time, it becomes t = d/s. Again, plugging in the values: t = 12 miles \u00f7 4 miles per hour, which is again 3 hours.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. For example, does the person take breaks? Is the walking speed constant? In real life, people might take breaks or their speed might vary, but since the question says \"average speed,\" I think it's safe to assume that the speed is constant and any breaks are already factored into the average.\n\nAlso, units are important here. The speed is given in miles per hour, and the distance is in miles, so the time will be in hours. If the units were different, I might need to do some conversions, but in this case, everything is consistent.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the person walks at a different speed. For example, if they walk at 3 miles per hour, how long would it take to walk 12 miles? Using the same formula, time equals distance divided by speed, so 12 miles \u00f7 3 miles per hour equals 4 hours. That makes sense because at a slower speed, it would take more time.\n\nSimilarly, if the person walks at 6 miles per hour, then time equals 12 miles \u00f7 6 miles per hour equals 2 hours. So, faster speed means less time, which is logical.\n\nGoing back to the original question, 12 miles at 4 miles per hour equals 3 hours. I think that's the answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's think about it in terms of proportions. If 4 miles are covered in 1 hour, then 12 miles would be covered in 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 hours. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, using dimensional analysis, the miles unit cancels out, leaving hours as the unit for time, which is correct.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
