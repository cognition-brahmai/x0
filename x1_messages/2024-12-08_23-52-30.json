        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you need a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array that contains only the even numbers from the original array, and these even numbers should be sorted in ascending order. Got it?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to approach this. We need to do two main things: filter out the even numbers and then sort them in ascending order.\n\nTo filter even numbers, we can use the `filter` method on the array. The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test would be checking if a number is even. A number is even if it's divisible by 2 without any remainder. So, we can use the modulo operator `%` to check this. If a number modulo 2 equals 0, it's even.\n\nAfter filtering the even numbers, we need to sort them in ascending order. JavaScript arrays have a `sort` method that can do this. By default, `sort` arranges the elements in ascending order when used with numbers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function would look something like this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction filterAndSortEvens(arr) {\n    // Filter even numbers\n    var evens = arr.filter(function(num) {\n        return num % 2 === 0;\n    });\n    // Sort the even numbers in ascending order\n    evens.sort(function(a, b) {\n        return a - b;\n    });\n    return evens;\n}\n```\n\nYou can test this function with an array of integers. For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2, 7, 4, 6];\nconsole.log(filterAndSortEvens(numbers)); // Should print [2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\nThis should work as expected. Let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array, sorted in ascending order.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Filter Even Numbers**: Use the `filter` method to create a new array containing only the even numbers. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 without any remainder (i.e., `num % 2 === 0`).\n2. **Sort in Ascending Order**: Use the `sort` method on the filtered array to sort the even numbers in ascending order.\n\n## Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction filterAndSortEvens(arr) {\n    // Filter even numbers\n    var evens = arr.filter(function(num) {\n        return num % 2 === 0;\n    });\n    // Sort the even numbers in ascending order\n    evens.sort(function(a, b) {\n        return a - b;\n    });\n    return evens;\n}\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n- **Filter Step**: The `filter` method iterates over each element in the input array `arr` and includes it in the new array `evens` only if it satisfies the condition `num % 2 === 0`, which checks if the number is even.\n- **Sort Step**: The `sort` method sorts the array `evens` in ascending order by comparing elements using the function `function(a, b) { return a - b; }`. This ensures numerical sorting instead of lexicographical sorting, which is the default behavior of the `sort` method.\n\nThis approach efficiently achieves the desired result by leveraging built-in array methods in JavaScript."
