        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a group \\( G \\) of order \\( p^2 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number, and we need to prove that \\( G \\) must be abelian. Okay, let's recall some group theory basics that might help us here.\n\nFirst off, the order of a group is the number of its elements. Here, the order is \\( p^2 \\), which is a power of a prime. I remember that groups of prime order are cyclic and therefore abelian, but here the order is \\( p^2 \\), which is a square of a prime. So, maybe there's something similar we can exploit.\n\nLet's think about the center of the group, denoted \\( Z(G) \\). The center consists of all elements that commute with every element in the group, i.e., \\( Z(G) = \\{ z \\in G \\mid zg = gz \\text{ for all } g \\in G \\} \\). It's a standard result that the center of a group is always a normal subgroup.\n\nNow, there's a theorem that says if the center of a group is not trivial (i.e., it's bigger than just the identity element), then the group has some nice properties. In particular, if the center is the whole group, then the group is abelian. So, maybe we can show that \\( Z(G) \\) is not trivial and then see what that implies.\n\nLet's consider the class equation, which relates the order of the group to the sizes of its conjugacy classes. The class equation is:\n\n\\[\n|G| = |Z(G)| + \\sum_{i} [G : C_G(g_i)]\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum is over a set of representatives \\( g_i \\) of the conjugacy classes not contained in the center, and \\( C_G(g_i) \\) is the centralizer of \\( g_i \\) in \\( G \\), which is the set of all elements in \\( G \\) that commute with \\( g_i \\).\n\nNow, since \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( |G| = p^2 \\), the order of any subgroup (including the center and centralizers) must divide \\( p^2 \\). So, possible orders for subgroups are 1, \\( p \\), or \\( p^2 \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility that \\( Z(G) \\) is trivial, i.e., \\( |Z(G)| = 1 \\). If that were the case, then the class equation would be:\n\n\\[\np^2 = 1 + \\sum_{i} [G : C_G(g_i)]\n\\]\n\nNow, each term \\( [G : C_G(g_i)] \\) is the index of the centralizer of \\( g_i \\), which is the number of elements in the conjugacy class of \\( g_i \\). Since \\( g_i \\) is not in the center, its conjugacy class has more than one element. Moreover, because \\( G \\) acts on itself by conjugation, the size of each conjugacy class divides the order of \\( G \\), which is \\( p^2 \\).\n\nHowever, since \\( g_i \\) is not in the center, its centralizer \\( C_G(g_i) \\) is strictly larger than just the center, but smaller than \\( G \\). Given that the order of \\( C_G(g_i) \\) must divide \\( p^2 \\), the only possibility is that \\( |C_G(g_i)| = p \\), because if it were \\( p^2 \\), it would be the whole group, meaning \\( g_i \\) is in the center, which contradicts our choice of \\( g_i \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( [G : C_G(g_i)] = \\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|} = \\frac{p^2}{p} = p \\). So, each term in the sum is \\( p \\).\n\nThus, the class equation becomes:\n\n\\[\np^2 = 1 + k \\cdot p\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the number of conjugacy classes not contained in the center.\n\nNow, let's rearrange this equation:\n\n\\[\np^2 - 1 = k \\cdot p \\implies k = \\frac{p^2 - 1}{p} = p - \\frac{1}{p}\n\\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) must be an integer, since it's the number of conjugacy classes. However, \\( p - \\frac{1}{p} \\) is not an integer because \\( p \\) is a prime greater than 1, so \\( \\frac{1}{p} \\) is not an integer. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that \\( Z(G) \\) is trivial must be false. So, \\( Z(G) \\) is not trivial, meaning \\( |Z(G)| \\) is either \\( p \\) or \\( p^2 \\).\n\nIf \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), then \\( Z(G) = G \\), which means \\( G \\) is abelian. That would be the desired conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), then \\( Z(G) \\) is a cyclic subgroup of order \\( p \\) (since any group of prime order is cyclic). In this case, \\( G/Z(G) \\) is a group of order \\( \\frac{|G|}{|Z(G)|} = \\frac{p^2}{p} = p \\), which is prime. Therefore, \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic.\n\nNow, there's a theorem that says if \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic, then \\( G \\) is abelian. Let me recall why that is. Suppose \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic, generated by some element \\( gZ(G) \\). Then, for any two elements \\( a, b \\in G \\), we can write \\( a = g^m z_1 \\) and \\( b = g^n z_2 \\), where \\( z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G) \\). Then,\n\n\\[\nab = g^m z_1 g^n z_2 = g^m g^n z_1 z_2 = g^{m+n} z_1 z_2\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nba = g^n z_2 g^m z_1 = g^n g^m z_2 z_1 = g^{n+m} z_2 z_1\n\\]\n\nSince addition is commutative, \\( m+n = n+m \\), and since \\( z_1, z_2 \\) are in the center, \\( z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1 \\). Therefore, \\( ab = ba \\), which means \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nWait a minute, but this seems to suggest that if \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic, then \\( G \\) is abelian, which would imply that \\( Z(G) = G \\), but that contradicts our earlier assumption that \\( |Z(G)| = p \\) when \\( |G| = p^2 \\).\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me double-check this theorem. Yes, it is a standard result in group theory that if \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic, then \\( G \\) is abelian. Therefore, if \\( |Z(G)| = p \\) and \\( |G| = p^2 \\), leading to \\( G/Z(G) \\) being cyclic of order \\( p \\), then \\( G \\) must be abelian.\n\nBut if \\( G \\) is abelian, then \\( Z(G) = G \\), which would mean \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), not \\( p \\). This seems like a contradiction.\n\nSo, perhaps the only possibility is that \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), meaning \\( G \\) is abelian. But earlier, we considered the case where \\( |Z(G)| = p \\) and concluded that \\( G \\) is abelian, which seems to lead to \\( Z(G) = G \\), a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Suppose \\( |Z(G)| = p \\). Then, \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic of order \\( p \\), so \\( G \\) is abelian. But if \\( G \\) is abelian, then \\( Z(G) = G \\), which has order \\( p^2 \\), not \\( p \\). This seems like a paradox.\n\nPerhaps this means that the assumption \\( |Z(G)| = p \\) leads to \\( G \\) being abelian, which implies \\( Z(G) = G \\), contradicting \\( |Z(G)| = p \\). Therefore, the only possibility is \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), meaning \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nThat makes sense. So, in summary:\n\n- If \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), then \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\n- If \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), then \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic of order \\( p \\), which implies \\( G \\) is abelian, but this would force \\( Z(G) = G \\), which has order \\( p^2 \\), contradicting \\( |Z(G)| = p \\).\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), meaning \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by considering the possible structures of groups of order \\( p^2 \\).\n\nWe know that groups of order \\( p^2 \\) are either isomorphic to the cyclic group \\( C_{p^2} \\) or to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order \\( p \\), denoted \\( C_p \\times C_p \\).\n\nBoth of these groups are abelian:\n\n- \\( C_{p^2} \\) is cyclic and hence abelian.\n\n- \\( C_p \\times C_p \\) is a direct product of abelian groups, so it is also abelian.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which structure \\( G \\) has, it must be abelian.\n\nBut perhaps this approach assumes results that we haven't proven yet, such as the classification of groups of order \\( p^2 \\). Maybe we should stick with the center and class equation approach to prove it from first principles.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the exponent of the group. In a group of order \\( p^2 \\), the order of any element divides \\( p^2 \\), so the possible orders are 1, \\( p \\), or \\( p^2 \\). If there exists an element of order \\( p^2 \\), then \\( G \\) is cyclic and hence abelian.\n\nIf no element has order \\( p^2 \\), then all non-identity elements have order \\( p \\). In this case, \\( G \\) is a \\( p \\)-group, and we can use properties of \\( p \\)-groups to show that \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the commutator subgroup \\( [G, G] \\), which measures the non-abelianness of \\( G \\). If \\( [G, G] \\) is trivial, then \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nSince \\( G \\) is a \\( p \\)-group of order \\( p^2 \\), its center is non-trivial, as we've already established. Moreover, in a \\( p \\)-group, the commutator subgroup is contained in the center. So, \\( [G, G] \\subseteq Z(G) \\).\n\nNow, if \\( G \\) is abelian, then \\( [G, G] = \\{ e \\} \\), which is contained in \\( Z(G) \\). But in our case, we've shown that \\( Z(G) \\) is not trivial, so \\( [G, G] \\) could be either of order \\( p \\) or \\( p^2 \\), but since \\( [G, G] \\) is a subgroup of \\( Z(G) \\), its order must divide \\( |Z(G)| \\).\n\nWait, but if \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), then \\( [G, G] \\) can be either of order 1 or \\( p \\). If \\( [G, G] \\) is of order 1, then \\( G \\) is abelian. If \\( [G, G] \\) is of order \\( p \\), then it is equal to \\( Z(G) \\).\n\nHowever, in this case, since \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic (of order \\( p \\)), as we've already established, this implies that \\( G \\) is abelian, which again leads to \\( Z(G) = G \\), contradicting \\( |Z(G)| = p \\). Therefore, the only possibility is \\( [G, G] = \\{ e \\} \\), meaning \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nThis seems to confirm our earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the number of elements of order \\( p \\) in \\( G \\). Since \\( G \\) is a \\( p \\)-group, all its elements have orders that are powers of \\( p \\), so orders are 1, \\( p \\), or \\( p^2 \\).\n\nIf there exists an element of order \\( p^2 \\), then \\( G \\) is cyclic and hence abelian.\n\nIf not, then all non-identity elements have order \\( p \\). In this case, \\( G \\) is a vector space over the field with \\( p \\) elements, because it's an abelian group where every non-identity element has order \\( p \\). This is a result from group theory: an abelian group where every element has order dividing \\( p \\) is a vector space over \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\).\n\nIn particular, a group of order \\( p^2 \\) where every non-identity element has order \\( p \\) is isomorphic to \\( C_p \\times C_p \\), which is abelian.\n\nTherefore, in either case, \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nWait, but this approach assumes that \\( G \\) is abelian in the second case, which might not be immediately obvious. Let me think again.\n\nIf all non-identity elements have order \\( p \\), and \\( G \\) is a \\( p \\)-group with non-trivial center, then \\( Z(G) \\) contains more than just the identity. If \\( Z(G) \\) has order \\( p^2 \\), then \\( G \\) is abelian. If \\( Z(G) \\) has order \\( p \\), then \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic of order \\( p \\), which again implies that \\( G \\) is abelian, leading to \\( Z(G) = G \\), a contradiction unless \\( Z(G) = G \\), meaning \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, we keep arriving at the conclusion that \\( G \\) must be abelian.\n\nPerhaps another way to see this is to consider the exponent of the group. The exponent of a group is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( g^n = e \\) for all \\( g \\in G \\). In a group of order \\( p^2 \\), the exponent must divide \\( p^2 \\), so it's either \\( p \\) or \\( p^2 \\).\n\nIf the exponent is \\( p^2 \\), then there exists an element of order \\( p^2 \\), making \\( G \\) cyclic and hence abelian.\n\nIf the exponent is \\( p \\), then every element satisfies \\( g^p = e \\). In this case, \\( G \\) is a group of exponent \\( p \\), and it's known that such groups are direct products of cyclic groups of order \\( p \\), which are abelian.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the automorphism group of \\( G \\). For abelian groups, the automorphism group has certain properties, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAnother thought: since \\( G \\) is a \\( p \\)-group, it has a non-trivial center. We can consider the action of \\( G \\) on itself by conjugation, which induces a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to \\( \\text{Aut}(G) \\), the automorphism group of \\( G \\). The kernel of this homomorphism is the center \\( Z(G) \\).\n\nIf \\( G \\) is non-abelian, then \\( Z(G) \\) is a proper subgroup of \\( G \\), so \\( |Z(G)| = p \\). Then, the image of \\( G \\) in \\( \\text{Aut}(G) \\) is isomorphic to \\( G/Z(G) \\), which has order \\( p \\). So, \\( \\text{Aut}(G) \\) has a subgroup of order \\( p \\).\n\nBut for groups of order \\( p^2 \\), the automorphism group has order \\( p(p-1)(p+1) \\) if \\( G \\) is elementary abelian, or something different if \\( G \\) is cyclic. Wait, this might be getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach using the class equation and the center of the group.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. The center \\( Z(G) \\) of \\( G \\) is non-trivial, i.e., \\( |Z(G)| \\) is either \\( p \\) or \\( p^2 \\).\n\n2. If \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), then \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\n3. If \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), then \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic of order \\( p \\), which implies \\( G \\) is abelian, leading to \\( Z(G) = G \\), a contradiction unless \\( Z(G) = G \\), meaning \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nTherefore, in all possible cases, \\( G \\) must be abelian.\n\nAlternatively, considering the classification of groups of order \\( p^2 \\), there are only two such groups up to isomorphism: the cyclic group \\( C_{p^2} \\) and the direct product \\( C_p \\times C_p \\), both of which are abelian.\n\nHence, we can confidently conclude that any group of order \\( p^2 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime, must be abelian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Any group of order } p^2 \\text{ is abelian.}} \\]"
