        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple CPU scheduler using the Round Robin algorithm in C. I need to make sure that the program can add new processes, execute them, and also show the current state of the queue. Since it's Round Robin, I know that each process gets a fixed amount of time to run before it's preempted and moved to the end of the queue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Round Robin scheduling is all about. Round Robin is a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice, often called a quantum. The CPU is allocated to processes on a first-come, first-served basis, but each process only runs for one time quantum before it's interrupted and moved to the end of the queue. This ensures that all processes get a fair share of the CPU time.\n\nSo, in my program, I need to have a queue of processes. Each process should have an identifier and a burst time, which is the amount of time it needs to complete its task. The burst time will be reduced by the quantum each time the process runs, and if it's not finished, it will be added back to the queue.\n\nI should probably represent each process as a structure with fields for the process ID and the remaining burst time. Maybe something like this:\n\n```c\nstruct Process {\n    int id;\n    int burstTime;\n};\n```\n\nI'll need a queue to hold these processes. In C, I can implement a queue using an array or a linked list. For simplicity, I'll use an array and keep track of the front and rear indices.\n\nI need functions to add a process to the queue, execute the processes using Round Robin, and print the current state of the queue.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the execution:\n\n1. Set a quantum, say 2 time units for this example.\n\n2. While there are processes in the queue:\n\na. Take the process from the front of the queue.\n\nb. If its burst time is less than or equal to the quantum, execute it for that much time and remove it from the queue.\n\nc. If its burst time is more than the quantum, execute it for the quantum time, reduce its burst time by the quantum, and move it to the end of the queue.\n\nI should also think about how to handle user input. The user should be able to add new processes while the scheduler is running. Maybe I can have a menu-based system where the user can choose to add a process, execute the scheduler, or print the queue.\n\nWait, but the task says to \"print out the state of the queue at any given moment.\" So, perhaps there should be an option to display the current queue status.\n\nAlso, since it's a simulator, I need to simulate the passage of time. Maybe use a loop that represents time units.\n\nBut to make it simple, I can have the execution happen in discrete steps, where each step corresponds to one time unit.\n\nLet me try to sketch a rough structure of the program:\n\n- Define the Process structure.\n\n- Define a queue structure to hold processes.\n\n- Implement functions to add a process to the queue, execute the scheduler, and print the queue.\n\n- Create a menu for user interaction: add process, execute scheduler, print queue.\n\nI need to handle the queue operations properly to avoid overflows and underflows. Since I'm using an array, I have to make sure that it doesn't get full or empty at wrong times.\n\nLet me think about the data structures in more detail.\n\nFor the queue, I'll use an array of Process structures. I'll need to define the size of the array beforehand. For simplicity, I'll set a maximum number of processes, say 100.\n\nI'll need front and rear indices to keep track of the queue's state.\n\nFor adding a process, I'll increment the rear index and place the new process there.\n\nFor removing a process, I'll increment the front index.\n\nSince it's a round-robin queue, I need to handle the circular nature of the queue. So, when rear reaches the end of the array, it should wrap around to the beginning.\n\nSimilarly, when front reaches the end, it should wrap around.\n\nWait, actually, in a circular queue, both front and rear wrap around when they reach the end of the array.\n\nI need to make sure that I handle the wrap-around correctly to avoid overwriting existing processes.\n\nAlso, I need a way to check if the queue is full or empty.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Queue is empty if front == rear.\n\n- Queue is full if (rear + 1) % QUEUE_SIZE == front.\n\nWait, that's a standard circular queue implementation.\n\nI should implement the queue operations accordingly.\n\nNow, for the execution function:\n\n- Define a quantum, say 2 time units.\n\n- While the queue is not empty:\n\n- Dequeue a process.\n\n- If its burst time is less than or equal to the quantum:\n\n- Execute it for its burst time.\n\n- Else:\n\n- Execute it for the quantum time.\n\n- Reduce its burst time by the quantum.\n\n- Enqueue it again.\n\nI need to simulate the execution time. Maybe use a loop that runs for the execution time and just delays for that period.\n\nBut since it's a simulator, I don't need actual time delays; I can just simulate the passage of time.\n\nSo, for each execution step, I'll decrement a counter.\n\nNow, about adding new processes during execution.\n\nIf processes can be added while the scheduler is running, I need to make sure that the queue is accessed properly to avoid conflicts.\n\nBut since this is a simple simulator and not a multi-threaded program, I can manage it sequentially.\n\nPerhaps, before executing the scheduler, I allow the user to add new processes, then execute the scheduler, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, have an option in the menu to add a process, execute one quantum, print queue, etc.\n\nI think that would work.\n\nLet me try to outline the menu options:\n\n1. Add a process\n\n2. Execute scheduler\n\n3. Print queue\n\n4. Exit\n\nFor adding a process, the user inputs the process ID and burst time. The process is then enqueued.\n\nFor executing the scheduler, it should run one quantum at a time, dequeuing processes, executing them for the quantum (or their remaining burst time), and enqueuing them again if they're not done.\n\nWait, but in Round Robin, it's usually about running each process for a fixed quantum and then moving on to the next.\n\nBut to make it simple, I can have the execute scheduler option to run one quantum, handle one process, and then return to the menu.\n\nAlternatively, have it run until the queue is empty.\n\nBut allowing the addition of new processes while it's running would make it more realistic.\n\nMaybe I'll have the execute scheduler option run one quantum, handle one process, and then return to the menu, allowing the user to add new processes in between.\n\nThis way, it's manageable in a sequential program.\n\nNow, about printing the queue: it should display the current processes in the queue, in order, with their IDs and remaining burst times.\n\nI need to make sure that the queue is printed correctly, handling the circular nature.\n\nAlright, let's start implementing this step by step.\n\nFirst, define the Process structure.\n\nThen, define the queue structure, including the array, front, and rear indices, and the size.\n\nImplement enqueue and dequeue functions for the queue, handling the circular nature.\n\nThen, implement the functions for adding a process, executing the scheduler, and printing the queue.\n\nFinally, create the menu system to allow user interaction.\n\nI should also define the quantum as a constant at the beginning.\n\nLet me start writing some code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to simulate a simple CPU scheduler using the Round Robin scheduling algorithm in C. The program should allow users to add new processes, execute them, and print the state of the queue at any given moment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Data Structures**:\n   - A `Process` structure to hold process ID and remaining burst time.\n   - A circular queue to manage the processes.\n\n2. **Functions**:\n   - `enqueue`: Add a process to the queue.\n   - `dequeue`: Remove a process from the queue.\n   - `add_process`: Get user input for a new process and enqueue it.\n   - `execute_scheduler`: Dequeue a process, run it for the quantum time, and re-enqueue if it hasn't completed.\n   - `print_queue`: Display the current state of the queue.\n\n3. **Menu-driven Interface**:\n   - Allow users to add processes, execute the scheduler, print the queue, or exit the program.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define QUEUE_SIZE 100\n#define QUANTUM 2\n\ntypedef struct Process {\n    int id;\n    int burstTime;\n} Process;\n\ntypedef struct {\n    Process items[QUEUE_SIZE];\n    int front;\n    int rear;\n} Queue;\n\nvoid initializeQueue(Queue *q) {\n    q->front = q->rear = -1;\n}\n\nint isFull(Queue *q) {\n    return (q->rear + 1) % QUEUE_SIZE == q->front;\n}\n\nint isEmpty(Queue *q) {\n    return q->front == -1;\n}\n\nvoid enqueue(Queue *q, Process item) {\n    if (isFull(q)) {\n        printf(\"Queue is full.
