        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the man buys a horse for $60 and then sells it for $70. That means he made a profit of $70 - $60 = $10 on the first transaction.\n\nThen, he buys the horse back for $80 and sells it again for $90. So, on this second transaction, he made a profit of $90 - $80 = $10.\n\nNow, to find the total profit, I just need to add up the profits from each transaction: $10 + $10 = $20.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about it differently. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's consider the total amount of money he spent and the total amount he received.\n\nHe bought the horse twice: once for $60 and once for $80. So, total spent is $60 + $80 = $140.\n\nHe sold the horse twice: once for $70 and once for $90. So, total received is $70 + $90 = $160.\n\nNow, profit would be total received minus total spent: $160 - $140 = $20.\n\nAlright, both methods give me the same answer. So, the total profit is $20.\n\nBut let's make sure there's no trick here. Sometimes these types of problems have some sort of catch. Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nLet's think about the ownership of the horse. He buys it for $60, sells it for $70, buys it back for $80, and sells it again for $90. So, he owned the horse twice, and each time he sold it for more than he bought it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at each pair of buy and sell transactions separately.\n\nFirst, buy for $60, sell for $70: profit is $10.\n\nThen, buy for $80, sell for $90: profit is another $10.\n\nTotal profit is $20.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire sequence:\n\nStarted with no horse. Bought for $60, owned it, sold for $70, didn't own it, bought back for $80, owned it again, sold for $90.\n\nSo, from start to finish, he spent $60 + $80 = $140 and received $70 + $90 = $160. Profit is $20.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider the horse's value at each transaction.\n\nBut no matter how I look at it, the profit seems to be $20.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
