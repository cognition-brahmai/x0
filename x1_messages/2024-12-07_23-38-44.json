        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a man has 12 socks in his drawer\u20146 black, 4 blue, and 2 red. The question is, in complete darkness, what's the minimum number of socks he must pull out to ensure he gets a pair of the same color. And I need to explain my reasoning behind this.\n\nAlright, first off, I need to understand what it means to ensure that he gets a pair of the same color. It's not about the probability of getting a matching pair; it's about guaranteeing it without seeing the colors. So, in the worst-case scenario, how many socks does he need to pull out to make sure that at least two of them are the same color?\n\nLet's think about the different colors he has: black, blue, and red. There are three colors in total. If he pulls out one sock, it could be any color\u2014black, blue, or red. If he pulls out a second sock, it could again be any color. There's a chance that the two socks are of the same color, but there's also a chance they're different.\n\nTo ensure that he gets a pair of the same color, he needs to consider the worst Possible combination. So, imagine he pulls out one black, one blue, and one red sock. That's three socks, each of a different color. Now, if he pulls out a fourth sock, it has to be one of the three colors already pulled out. Therefore, whichever color it is, it will match one of the socks he already has.\n\nSo, the minimum number of socks he must pull out to ensure he gets a pair of the same color is four.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Suppose he pulls out three socks: one black, one blue, and one red. Then, the fourth sock he pulls out could be any color. If he pulls out a black sock, now he has two black socks, which is a pair. Similarly, if it's blue, he has two blue socks, or if it's red, two red socks. So, yes, four socks guarantee at least one pair of the same color.\n\nBut is there a way to ensure it with fewer socks? Let's see. If he pulls out only three socks, as in the earlier example, they could all be different colors: one black, one blue, and one red. In that case, he doesn't have a pair of the same color. So, three socks don't guarantee a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, four is indeed the minimum number of socks he must pull out to ensure he gets a pair of the same color.\n\nAnother way to think about this is using the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this context, the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors, and the \"pigeons\" are the socks being pulled out.\n\nHere, there are three colors (pigeonholes). If he pulls out four socks (pigeons), then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must have at least two socks. That is, there will be at least one pair of the same color.\n\nSo, applying the pigeonhole principle confirms that four is the minimum number required to ensure a matching pair.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the worst-case scenario again. He pulls out one black, one blue, and one red sock. That's three socks, each of a different color. The next sock he pulls out must be either black, blue, or red, which means it will match one of the existing socks. Therefore, after four socks, he is guaranteed to have at least one pair of the same color.\n\nI don't think there's any way to guarantee a matching pair with fewer than four socks, given the distribution of colors. Even if there are more socks of one color than others, in the worst case, he could still pick one of each color first.\n\nSo, my final answer is four socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
