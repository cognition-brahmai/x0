Humans belong to the species Homo sapiens, which is a part of the animal kingdom. However, humans are often distinguished from other animals due to their unique cognitive abilities, such as advanced problem-solving skills, language, and cultural practices. So, while humans are a type of animal, they are often classified separately because of their distinct characteristics and capabilities."
