        "content": "Let's see. So, in this game, players earn points by completing tasks, and each task takes 10 minutes to finish. For every 2 tasks they complete, they get 15 points. If a player spends 100 minutes playing, how many points do they earn?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many tasks the player can complete in 100 minutes. Since each task takes 10 minutes, I can divide the total time spent by the time per task:\n\n100 minutes \u00f7 10 minutes/task = 10 tasks\n\nSo, the player completes 10 tasks in 100 minutes.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many sets of 2 tasks are there in 10 tasks, because for every 2 tasks, the player earns 15 points.\n\n10 tasks \u00f7 2 tasks/set = 5 sets\n\nNow, for each set, the player gets 15 points, so for 5 sets:\n\n5 sets \u00d7 15 points/set = 75 points\n\nTherefore, the player earns 75 points for completing 10 tasks in 100 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe in terms of points per minute or something like that?\n\nLet me think. If each task takes 10 minutes and 2 tasks give 15 points, then the points per minute could be calculated to see if it matches.\n\nFirst, points per task: since 2 tasks give 15 points, one task gives 15 \u00f7 2 = 7.5 points.\n\nSo, per task, the player earns 7.5 points.\n\nGiven that each task takes 10 minutes, the points per minute would be 7.5 points \u00f7 10 minutes = 0.75 points per minute.\n\nNow, if the player plays for 100 minutes, the total points would be:\n\n100 minutes \u00d7 0.75 points/minute = 75 points\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, 75 points seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure there's no mistake.\n\nAnother way: if 2 tasks take 20 minutes and give 15 points, then in 100 minutes, there are 100 \u00f7 20 = 5 sets.\n\nEach set gives 15 points, so 5 \u00d7 15 = 75 points.\n\nYes, consistent again.\n\nAlternatively, if the player completes 10 tasks in 100 minutes and gets 15 points for every 2 tasks, then it's the same as before.\n\nI think 75 points is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
