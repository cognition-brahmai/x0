        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory produces 300 units per day and operates for 20 days each month. First, I need to find out how many units they produce in a month.\n\nUnits per month = units per day \u00d7 days per month\n= 300 units/day \u00d7 20 days/month\n= 6,000 units/month\n\nNext, I need to find out the annual production. There are 12 months in a year, so:\n\nUnits per year = units per month \u00d7 months per year\n= 6,000 units/month \u00d7 12 months/year\n= 72,000 units/year\n\nNow, the defect rate is 2%. To find out how many defective units that is, I can calculate 2% of the annual production.\n\nDefective units per year = total units per year \u00d7 defect rate\n= 72,000 units/year \u00d7 0.02\n= 1,440 units/year\n\nSo, the factory will produce 1,440 defective units in a year.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. For example, maybe I can calculate the daily defective units and then scale that up to a year.\n\nFirst, find the daily defective units:\n\nDefective units per day = units per day \u00d7 defect rate\n= 300 units/day \u00d7 0.02\n= 6 units/day\n\nThen, find the monthly defective units:\n\nDefective units per month = defective units per day \u00d7 days per month\n= 6 units/day \u00d7 20 days/month\n= 120 units/month\n\nFinally, find the annual defective units:\n\nDefective units per year = defective units per month \u00d7 months per year\n= 120 units/month \u00d7 12 months/year\n= 1,440 units/year\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total production over the year and then apply the defect rate directly, which is what I did in the first method.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the defect rate is consistent across production, so whether I calculate it monthly or annually, the total defective units should come out the same.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, does the factory operate the same number of days every month? The problem says it operates 20 days in a month, so I'll assume that's consistent.\n\nAlso, the defect rate is given as 2%, and there's no information suggesting that it varies over time, so I'll assume it's constant throughout the year.\n\nSo, based on this, I think 1,440 defective units per year is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the data.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total operating days in a year and then find the total defective units based on that.\n\nFirst, find the total operating days in a year:\n\nOperating days per year = operating days per month \u00d7 months per year\n= 20 days/month \u00d7 12 months/year\n= 240 days/year\n\nThen, calculate the total production in a year:\n\nTotal units per year = units per day \u00d7 operating days per year\n= 300 units/day \u00d7 240 days/year\n= 72,000 units/year\n\nAgain, applying the defect rate:\n\nDefective units per year = total units per year \u00d7 defect rate\n= 72,000 units/year \u00d7 0.02\n= 1,440 units/year\n\nSame answer again. This gives me confidence that 1,440 is the correct number of defective units produced in a year.\n\nLet me think if there's any possibility of misinterpretation in the problem statement.\n\nThe factory produces 300 units per day, operates 20 days a month, and has a 2% defect rate. The question is asking for the number of defective units produced in a year.\n\nI've considered the annual production by multiplying the monthly production by 12, and also by multiplying the daily production by the total operating days in a year, and both approaches give me the same result.\n\nSo, I don't see any inconsistency in the calculations.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 1,440 defective units in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1440} \\]"
