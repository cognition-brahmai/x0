        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a city with 150,000 registered voters. First, we need to find out how many of them actually voted in the election. The problem says that 60% of them voted. So, to find the number of voters, I'll multiply the total registered voters by 60%.\n\nNumber of voters = 150,000 * 60%\n\nBut remember, 60% is the same as 0.60 in decimal form. So,\n\nNumber of voters = 150,000 * 0.60\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n150,000 * 0.60 = 90,000\n\nSo, 90,000 people voted in the election.\n\nNext, we're told that 55% of those who voted chose candidate X. So, to find out how many votes candidate X received, I need to take 55% of the number of voters, which is 90,000.\n\nVotes for candidate X = 90,000 * 55%\n\nAgain, 55% is 0.55 in decimal form.\n\nVotes for candidate X = 90,000 * 0.55\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n90,000 * 0.55 = 49,500\n\nSo, candidate X received 49,500 votes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. First, I calculated 60% of 150,000 to find the number of voters, which is 90,000. That seems correct because 10% of 150,000 is 15,000, so 60% would be 90,000.\n\nThen, I took 55% of 90,000 to find the votes for candidate X, which is 49,500. Let me verify that multiplication:\n\n90,000 * 0.55:\n\n90,000 * 0.5 = 45,000\n\n90,000 * 0.05 = 4,500\n\nAdding them up: 45,000 + 4,500 = 49,500\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is that candidate X received 49,500 votes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49500} \\]"
