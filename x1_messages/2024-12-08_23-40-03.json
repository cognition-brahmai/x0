        "content": "To calculate the area of a triangle, I know there's a specific formula for that. I think it's something like half the base times the height. Let me make sure I remember it correctly.\n\nSo, the formula for the area of a triangle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nIn this case, the base is 10 cm and the height is 15 cm. So, I just need to plug these values into the formula.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the formula again:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nNow, substituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 15 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nNext, I need to perform the multiplication. Let me first multiply the base and the height:\n\n\\[ 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 15 \\, \\text{cm} = 150 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\nNow, I need to take half of that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 150 \\, \\text{cm}^2 = 75 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 75 square centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've done this correctly. The formula is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\), and I've substituted the values correctly. The base is 10 cm and the height is 15 cm, and multiplying them gives 150 cm\u00b2. Then, half of 150 is 75, so 75 cm\u00b2 seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider why the formula is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). I think it's because a triangle is essentially half of a parallelogram. If you take two identical triangles, you can put them together to form a parallelogram, and the area of a parallelogram is base times height. Therefore, the area of one triangle is half of that.\n\nSo, in this case, the area of the parallelogram would be 10 cm times 15 cm, which is 150 cm\u00b2, and half of that is 75 cm\u00b2, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are correct. Since both the base and height are in centimeters, multiplying them gives square centimeters, which is the correct unit for area.\n\nIs there any other way to calculate the area of a triangle? I know that there are other formulas, like Heron's formula, which uses the lengths of all three sides, but in this case, I only have the base and height, so the standard formula is the most appropriate.\n\nLet me also consider if the triangle is a right-angled triangle. If it's a right-angled triangle with the base and height being the two perpendicular sides, then the area formula still applies the same way.\n\nBut in this problem, it doesn't specify the type of triangle, so I'm assuming it's a general triangle, and the given base and height are perpendicular to each other.\n\nWait, actually, in a triangle, the height is always perpendicular to the base, regardless of the type of triangle. So, whether it's a right-angled triangle, acute triangle, or obtuse triangle, the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.\n\nSo, in this case, since the height is given as 15 cm, which is perpendicular to the base of 10 cm, the formula should apply directly.\n\nIs there any possibility that the height is not perpendicular to the base? I don't think so, because by definition, the height is the perpendicular distance.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed that the area is indeed 75 cm\u00b2.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can try plugging in the values in a different order. Let's see:\n\nFirst, multiply \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) by the base:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\, \\text{cm} = 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nThen, multiply that by the height:\n\n\\[ 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 15 \\, \\text{cm} = 75 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\nSame answer again. So, that reinforces that 75 cm\u00b2 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the base as 15 cm and the height as 10 cm, but that would not be correct because the base and height are specific measurements. The base is given as 10 cm, and the height corresponding to that base is 15 cm. So, I should not swap them.\n\nWait, actually, in a triangle, you can choose any side as the base, and the height is the perpendicular distance from that base to the opposite vertex. So, if I choose a different side as the base, the height would change accordingly.\n\nBut in this problem, only one base and one height are given, so I should stick with those measurements.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any other factor that could affect the area, like the units. The base and height are both in centimeters, so multiplying them gives square centimeters, which is correct for area.\n\nIf the units were different, I'd need to convert them to the same unit before multiplying, but in this case, they're already in the same unit.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that the measurements are positive numbers, which they are: 10 cm and 15 cm.\n\nI can't have negative lengths in this context.\n\nSo, overall, I'm confident that the area is 75 cm\u00b2.\n\nJust to summarize the steps:\n\n1. Recall the formula for the area of a triangle: \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n\n2. Substitute the given values: base = 10 cm, height = 15 cm.\n\n3. Multiply the base and height: \\(10 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 15 \\, \\text{cm} = 150 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).\n\n4. Take half of that product: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 150 \\, \\text{cm}^2 = 75 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).\n\n5. Verify the calculation by considering the relationship between triangles and parallelograms.\n\n6. Confirm that the units are correct.\n\n7. Consider alternative approaches and ensure that no mistakes were made.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 75 cm\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75 \\, \\text{cm}^2} \\]"
