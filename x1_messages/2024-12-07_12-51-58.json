        "content": "So the factory produces 250 widgets per hour, and it operates for 16 hours a day, 5 days a week. I need to find out how many widgets it produces in one week.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many widgets are produced in one day. Since it produces 250 widgets per hour and operates for 16 hours a day, I can multiply 250 by 16 to get the daily production.\n\nSo, 250 widgets/hour \u00d7 16 hours/day = 4,000 widgets/day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days it operates in a week. It operates 5 days a week, so:\n\n4,000 widgets/day \u00d7 5 days/week = 20,000 widgets/week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n250 multiplied by 16 is indeed 4,000. And 4,000 multiplied by 5 is 20,000. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total production over the week is the product of the production rate per hour, the number of hours per day, and the number of days per week.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nProduction per week = 250 widgets/hour \u00d7 16 hours/day \u00d7 5 days/week.\n\nMultiplying those together:\n\nFirst, 250 \u00d7 16 = 4,000.\n\nThen, 4,000 \u00d7 5 = 20,000.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply them in a different order. Let's see:\n\n250 \u00d7 5 = 1,250.\n\nThen, 1,250 \u00d7 16 = 20,000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, the factory produces 20,000 widgets in one week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the production. For example, are there any downtime or breaks within those 16 hours? The question says the factory operates for 16 hours a day, so I'm assuming that's the total operating time including any breaks.\n\nBut based on the information given, I don't think there are any other factors to consider. The production rate is given as 250 widgets per hour, and the operating hours are specified.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total number of hours the factory operates in a week and then multiply that by the production rate per hour.\n\nSo, hours per day is 16, days per week is 5, so total hours per week is 16 \u00d7 5 = 80 hours.\n\nThen, production per week is 250 widgets/hour \u00d7 80 hours = 20,000 widgets.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20000} \\]"
