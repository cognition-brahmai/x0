        "content": "I'm here to help with your question about sci-fi TV series. So, you're looking for a show where the main characters live aboard a space station called Deep Space Nine. Let me think about this.\n\nI know that there are quite a few space-based sci-fi series out there, but Deep Space Nine rings a bell. I believe it's from the Star Trek franchise. Star Trek has had several series over the years, each set in different parts of the Star Trek universe.\n\nSo, in the Star Trek universe, there's Star Trek: The Original Series, which was set on the USS Enterprise, and then there's Star Trek: The Next Generation, set on the USS Enterprise-D. But Deep Space Nine sounds different because it's a space station, not a starship.\n\nI think Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is the one you're referring to. It's a separate series within the Star Trek franchise that focuses on the crew of the space station Deep Space Nine, which is located near a wormhole leading to the distant Gamma Quadrant.\n\nIn this series, the space station plays a central role, and the characters deal with various challenges and conflicts in that region of space. It's known for its unique setting and story arcs that differ from the more exploratory nature of The Next Generation.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the sci-fi TV series where characters live aboard a space station named Deep Space Nine is called Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this show or sci-fi in general?"
