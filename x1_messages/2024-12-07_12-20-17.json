        "content": "So there are marbles in a bag: 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue marble randomly. Okay, probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of marbles. There are 5 red + 3 blue + 2 green, which equals 10 marbles in total.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue marble. So, that's 5 red + 3 blue, which is 8 marbles.\n\nSo, the probability should be 8 favorable outcomes over 10 total marbles. That is 8/10, which simplifies to 4/5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the addition rule of probabilities. The probability of A or B is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). But in this case, since picking a red marble and picking a blue marble are mutually exclusive events (you can't pick both at the same time), P(A and B) is zero. So, it should just be P(red) + P(blue).\n\nP(red) is 5/10, and P(blue) is 3/0, so 5/10 + 3/10 = 8/10, which again simplifies to 4/5.\n\nHmm, that matches my first approach. Good, consistent answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not picking a green marble, since the only other options are red and blue. The number of non-green marbles is 10 total - 2 green = 8, so again, 8/10 or 4/5.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. So, I can be confident that 4/5 is the correct probability of picking either a red or a blue marble from the bag.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{5}} \\]"
