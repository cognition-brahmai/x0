        "content": "Let's see what this riddle is about. It says, \"Used left or right, I get to travel over cobblestone or gravel. Used up, I vie for sweet success, used down, I cause men great duress.\" Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"used left or right\" suggests that the object in question has directions associated with it, and when used in these directions, it travels over certain types of surfaces\u2014cobblestone or gravel. So, maybe it's something that moves or is moved in different directions.\n\nCobblestone and gravel are both types of surfaces, typically found on roads or paths. So, perhaps it's a tool or a device that can be used on such surfaces.\n\nNext, \"used up, I vie for sweet success.\" \"Used up\" might mean using it in an upward direction or perhaps consuming it in some way. \"Vie for sweet success\" suggests striving for a positive outcome, maybe something sweet literal or figurative.\n\nThen, \"used down, I cause men great duress.\" \"Used down\" could mean using it downward or perhaps depreciating it, and this action causes distress or trouble for people.\n\nLet me think about objects that can be used in different directions with these varying outcomes.\n\nOne thing that comes to mind is a lever. Levers can be used in different directions: left, right, up, down, and each direction might have a different effect.\n\nFor example, a lever in a machine that, when moved left or right, operates over some surface, maybe grinding or moving something over cobblestone or gravel.\n\nThen, when used up, it might activate a mechanism that leads to success, perhaps lifting something valuable or completing a task.\n\nConversely, when used down, it might trigger something negative, like causing harm or creating a problem.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that fits all the clues.\n\nAnother possibility is a plow or a similar agricultural tool. Plows are used to till the land, which might be over cobblestone or gravel if the soil is rocky.\n\nUsing it in different directions would make sense in farming.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean plowing upwards, which might not make much sense, or perhaps tilling in a way that prepares the soil for successful planting.\n\n\"Used down\" could mean putting too much pressure, compacting the soil, which would be detrimental to planting.\n\nBut that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nLet me consider something more abstract. Maybe it's a metaphor for a decision or a choice that can be made in different directions, each leading to different outcomes.\n\nFor example, choosing left or right could represent different paths in life, traveling over the ups and downs of life (cobblestone or gravel).\n\n\"Used up,\" meaning choosing to aim high or aspire upwards, which could lead to success.\n\n\"Used down\" might mean giving up or choosing negative paths, causing duress.\n\nBut that seems too vague for a riddle.\n\nPerhaps it's something more concrete.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of shoe or footwear. Shoes are used for traveling over different surfaces like cobblestone and gravel.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean using them to climb upwards, maybe climbing a ladder or a hill, which could lead to success.\n\n\"Used down\" might mean using them to trample something or to stomp down, which could cause duress to others.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to fit perfectly.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's a type of vehicle. A cart or a wagon that travels over cobblestone or gravel streets.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean using it to carry something upwards, like up a hill or stairs, which could lead to success in delivery.\n\n\"Used down\" could mean using it to carry heavy loads downwards, which might be stressful on the vehicle or the users.\n\nStill, that doesn't seem to fully capture the riddle.\n\nLet me try thinking differently. Maybe it's a tool used in construction or mining.\n\nFor example, a pickaxe. Used left or right to break stones or gravel.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean using it to chisel upwards, perhaps to free something valuable, leading to success.\n\n\"Used down\" could mean using it to break through to lower levels, which might release something dangerous or cause collapse, leading to duress.\n\nThat could work, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: a key. Used left or right to turn in a lock, perhaps on a door that leads to a path with cobblestone or gravel.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean using it to open a door leading upwards, to a successful outcome.\n\n\"Used down\" could mean using it to open a door leading downwards, to a dangerous or distressing situation.\n\nThat's an interesting angle, but maybe a bit forced.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of arrow or directional indicator. Used left or right to guide travel over different terrains.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean pointing upwards, indicating a path to success.\n\n\"Used down\" could mean pointing downwards, indicating a path of danger or duress.\n\nThat could make sense, but it's still a bit unclear.\n\nLet me consider something more everyday.\n\nMaybe it's a pen or a writing instrument. Used left or right to write on different surfaces, like cobblestone or gravel, though that seems impractical.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean writing upwards, perhaps in a hierarchical sense, leading to success.\n\n\"Used down\" could mean writing downwards, perhaps in a degradation sense, causing duress.\n\nThat doesn't seem to fit well.\n\nAnother idea: a sword or a knife. Used left or right to fight or travel through obstacles.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean using it to climb upwards, like scaling a wall, leading to success.\n\n\"Used down\" could mean using it to stab or cause harm, leading to duress.\n\nPossible, but again, a bit of a stretch.\n\nPerhaps it's a type of flag or signal. Used left or right to indicate directions over a path.\n\n\"Used up\" could mean raising it high, signaling success.\n\n\"Used down\" could mean lowering it, signaling distress or danger.\n\nThat's an interesting thought. Signals are often used in navigation and communication, and their direction can have different meanings.\n\nIn maritime terms, flags and signals are crucial for communication between ships and from shore.\n\nSo, if it's a signal flag:\n\n- Used left or right: indicating directions to travel over certain paths (cobblestone or gravel, perhaps metaphorical paths).\n\n- Used up: raising it high, which could signal success or a specific command.\n\n- Used down: lowering it or signaling downwards, which could indicate danger or duress.\n\nThis seems to align well with the riddle's clues.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a semaphore arm used in railway signaling or military communications.\n\n- Used left or right: indicating different directions or paths.\n\n- Used up: raised, signaling proceed or success.\n\n- Used down: lowered, signaling stop or danger, causing duress.\n\nThis seems like a strong candidate for the answer to the riddle.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the answer is a \"signal\" or more specifically, a \"signal flag\" or a \"semaphore arm.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{a signal flag or semaphore arm}} \\]"
