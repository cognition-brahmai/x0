        "content": "In scientific taxonomy, humans and other apes are not considered monkeys, although there is some overlap in terminology and classification. To understand this, it's important to look at the taxonomic hierarchy and the specific classifications within the primate order.\n\nPrimates are a diverse group of mammals that include lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans. Within the primate order, there are two main suborders: Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini.\n\nStrepsirrhini includes prosimians such as lemurs and lorises.\n\nHaplorhini includes tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans.\n\nWithin Haplorhini, there is a further division into two parvorders: Tarsiiformes (tarsiers) and Simiiformes (simians), which includes both monkeys and apes.\n\nSimiiformes is divided into two infraorders: Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (Old World monkeys and apes).\n\nCatarrhini is further divided into two superfamilies: Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) and Hominoidea (apes and humans).\n\nSo, in this classification system, apes and humans are placed in the superfamily Hominoidea, which is distinct from the superfamily Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys). New World monkeys are in the infraorder Platyrrhini.\n\nTherefore, scientifically, apes and humans are not considered monkeys, although all are simians within the Haplorhini suborder.\n\nHowever, in everyday language and informal contexts, the term \"monkey\" is sometimes used more broadly to refer to any primate that is not a human, which can include apes. But this is not accurate in a scientific sense.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Scientifically, humans and apes are not monkeys; they are part of the Hominoidea superfamily, separate from the Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) and Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).\n\n- In informal language, the term \"monkey\" might be used more broadly, but this is not reflective of scientific classification.\n\nI hope this clarifies the relationship between humans, apes, and monkeys in scientific taxonomy."
