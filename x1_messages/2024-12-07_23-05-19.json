Let's see... \"I'm tall when I'm young, and I'm short when I'm old.\" Okay, so it's something that starts off tall in its early stage and becomes short in its later stage.\n\nWell, one thing that comes to mind is a candle. When a candle is new or young, it's tall, and as it burns over time, it gets shorter. That seems to fit the description.\n\nAnother possibility could be a person. When people are young, they are tall compared to when they are old and maybe shrink a bit due to age. But I'm not sure if that's what the riddle is getting at.\n\nWait, maybe it's grass or some kind of plant. When it's young, it grows tall, and then when it's old, it maybe wilts or bends over, becoming shorter. That could work too.\n\nOr perhaps it's a tower or a building that starts tall and then over time, maybe it gets demolished or falls down, becoming short.\n\nBut going back to the candle, that seems like a classic example for this type of riddle. So, I think the answer is a candle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{candle}} \\]"
