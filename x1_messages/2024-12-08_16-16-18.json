        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you build a concurrent web scraper in GoLang that fetches data from multiple URLs and stores the size of the responses in a map. Sound good?\n\nFirst, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from golang.org if you haven't already.\n\nOkay, so concurrency in Go is handled really well with goroutines and channels. We'll use goroutines to make HTTP requests concurrently and channels to communicate the results back to the main function.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Import the necessary packages: `net/http` for HTTP requests, and `sync` for synchronization primitives.\n\n2. Define a function that makes an HTTP GET request to a URL and returns the size of the response body.\n\n3. Use a wait group from the `sync` package to wait for all goroutines to finish.\n\n4. Use a map to store the URL and its corresponding response size.\n\n5. In the main function, create a list of URLs to scrape.\n\n6. For each URL, launch a goroutine to fetch the response size and store it in the map.\n\n7. Wait for all goroutines to complete using the wait group.\n\n8. Finally, print out the map containing URLs and their response sizes.\n\nLet's start writing some code. First, the imports:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"sync\"\n)\n```\n\nNext, define a function that takes a URL, makes an HTTP GET request, reads the response body, calculates its size, and returns the size. We'll also handle any errors that might occur during the request.\n\n```go\nfunc fetchURLSize(url string) (int, error) {\n\tresp, err := http.Get(url)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, err\n\t}\n\tdefer resp.Body.Close()\n\n\tbody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, err\n\t}\n\n\treturn len(body), nil\n}\n```\n\nNow, in the main function, we'll set up a wait group and a map to store the results.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\turls := []string{\n\t\t\"http://example.com\",\n\t\t\"http://example.org\",\n\t\t\"http://example.net\",\n\t\t// Add more URLs as needed\n\t}\n\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\tresults := make(map[string]int)\n\n\tfor _, url := range urls {\n\t\twg.Add(1)\n\t\tgo func(u string) {\n\t\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\t\t\tsize, err := fetchURLSize(u)\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Error fetching %s: %s\\n\", u, err)\n\t\t\t\treturn\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tresults[u] = size\n\t\t}(url)\n\t}\n\n\twg.Wait()\n\n\tfor url, size := range results {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"URL: %s, Size: %d bytes\\n\", url, size)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nLet's go through this code:\n\n- We have a slice of strings containing the URLs we want to scrape.\n\n- We initialize a `sync.WaitGroup` to keep track of the number of goroutines.\n\n- We create an empty map to store the results.\n\n- For each URL, we call `wg.Add(1)` to increment the wait group counter and launch a goroutine to fetch the URL size.\n\n- Inside the goroutine, we call `fetchURLSize` to get the size of the response body.\n\n- If there's an error, we print it; otherwise, we store the size in the map.\n\n- After starting all the goroutines, we call `wg.Wait()` to block until all goroutines have finished.\n\n- Finally, we iterate over the map and print the URL and its corresponding size.\n\nThis should give you a basic concurrent web scraper in GoLang. You can expand upon this by adding more features, such as handling timeouts, retrying failed requests, or scraping more data from the responses.\n\nRemember to test this code with a few URLs to make sure it works as expected. Also, be respectful when scraping websites and\u9075\u5b88robots.txt rules and terms of service.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
