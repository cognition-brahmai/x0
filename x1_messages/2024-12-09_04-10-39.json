        "content": "So you've got a book that's 200 pages long, and you're planning to read 20 pages each day. You want to know how many days it'll take to finish the book. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what's being asked. You have a total of 200 pages to read, and you're committing to read 20 pages every day. So, essentially, you're dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages you read per day to find out how many days it will take.\n\nMathematically, this is a division problem: total pages divided by pages per day equals the number of days.\n\nSo, it's 200 pages \u00f7 20 pages per day.\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n200 \u00f7 20 = 10.\n\nSo, it would take 10 days to finish the book if you read 20 pages each day.\n\nBut let's think about this a bit more to make sure it makes sense. If you read 20 pages a day for 10 days, that's 20 \u00d7 10 = 200 pages, which matches the total number of pages in the book. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nNow, consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. For example, maybe some days you read a little more or a little less, but since you're committing to 20 pages per day, we'll assume that you stick to that schedule.\n\nAlso, think about whether the book has any features that might affect reading time, like illustrations or difficult text, but since the question doesn't specify, we'll assume that the reading speed is consistent across all pages.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether you read every day without any breaks. If you take a day off, that would extend the total time. But based on the information given, you're reading 20 pages per day continuously, so no breaks are factored in.\n\nLet's also consider if there's any remainder when you divide 200 by 20. 200 divided by 20 is exactly 10, with no remainder. That means you'll finish the book completely in 10 days without any partial days of reading.\n\nTo further illustrate, let's imagine breaking down the 200 pages into chunks of 20 pages each. So, you have:\n\nDay 1: pages 1-20\n\nDay 2: pages 21-40\n\nDay 3: pages 41-60\n\nDay 4: pages 61-80\n\nDay 5: pages 81-100\n\nDay 6: pages 101-120\n\nDay 7: pages 121-140\n\nDay 8: pages 141-160\n\nDay 9: pages 161-180\n\nDay 10: pages 181-200\n\nAs you can see, on day 10, you finish the last 20 pages, which completes the book.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if the total number of pages wasn't perfectly divisible by the daily reading amount. For example, if the book had 210 pages and you read 20 pages per day.\n\n210 \u00f7 20 = 10.5 days.\n\nBut since you can't really read half a day, you'd need to round up to 11 days. So, in that case, it would take 11 days to finish the book.\n\nHowever, in our original scenario, with 200 pages and 20 pages per day, it's exactly 10 days.\n\nLet's also think about the units. Pages are being divided by pages per day to get days, which makes sense dimensionally.\n\nAdditionally, if you wanted to find out how many weeks it would take, you could divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\n10 days \u00f7 7 days/week \u2248 1.428 weeks.\n\nSo, it's a little over a week and a half. But since the question asks for days, 10 days is the precise answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use proportions. If 20 pages are read in 1 day, then 200 pages would be read in x days.\n\nSo, 20 pages : 1 day = 200 pages : x days.\n\nThis can be written as 20/1 = 200/x.\n\nSolving for x: x = 200 / 20 = 10 days.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nLet's also consider the time aspect. If you read 20 pages per day, how much time does that take? Well, that depends on your reading speed, which isn't specified in the question. So, we'll assume that the time aspect is not relevant here, and we're just focusing on the number of days based on the number of pages read per day.\n\nIn conclusion, if you read 20 pages per day, it will take you exactly 10 days to finish a 200-page book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
