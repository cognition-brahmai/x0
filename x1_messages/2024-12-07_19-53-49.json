        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A farmer has a rectangular field that's 40 meters by 60 meters, and he wants to divide it into square plots with equal area and whole number side lengths. I need to find out the largest possible size for the side length of each square plot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The field is rectangular, and its dimensions are 40m by 60m. So, the area of the entire field is 40m * 60m = 2400 square meters. Now, the farmer wants to divide this field into square plots, each with whole number side lengths, meaning the side of each square plot should be an integer number of meters.\n\nThe key here is that all the squares should have the same area, which implies that they all have the same side length since they're squares. So, I need to find the largest possible whole number that can be the side length of these squares, such that the field can be perfectly divided into such squares without any leftover space.\n\nThis sounds like a problem related to finding a common divisor of the field's length and width. Specifically, since the squares need to fit perfectly along both the length and the width of the field, the side length of the squares should be a divisor of both 40m and 60m.\n\nSo, to find the largest possible side length for the squares, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 40 and 60. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One common method is to list all the divisors of each number and then identify the largest number that appears in both lists.\n\nFirst, I'll list the divisors of 40:\n\n40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40\n\nNow, the divisors of 60:\n\n60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60\n\nNow, looking for the common divisors in both lists:\n\nCommon divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor is 20.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible side length for each square plot is 20 meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIf the side length is 20 meters, then along the width of 40 meters, the number of squares would be 40 / 20 = 2 squares.\n\nAlong the length of 60 meters, the number of squares would be 60 / 20 = 3 squares.\n\nSo, the field would be divided into 2 * 3 = 6 square plots, each with a side length of 20 meters.\n\nThat seems to fit perfectly without any leftover space.\n\nBut is there a larger possible side length? Let's see. If I choose 25 meters, for example, but 25 doesn't divide 40 evenly, since 40 / 25 = 1.6, which is not an integer. So, that won't work.\n\nWhat about 10 meters? 40 / 10 = 4, and 60 / 10 = 6, which would give 24 squares. But that's smaller than 20 meters, so 20 meters is still larger.\n\nWhat about 4 meters? 40 / 4 = 10, and 60 / 4 = 15, giving 150 squares. Again, smaller than 20 meters.\n\nSimilarly, 5 meters: 40 / 5 = 8, 60 / 5 = 12, giving 96 squares. Still smaller than 20 meters.\n\nSo, 20 meters seems to be the largest possible side length that divides both dimensions evenly.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 40 and 60, which might be more efficient.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works as follows:\n\n- Divide 60 by 40, which gives quotient 1 and remainder 20.\n\n- Then divide 40 by 20, which gives quotient 2 and remainder 0.\n\n- When the remainder is 0, the divisor at that step is the GCD.\n\nSo, GCD(60, 40) = 20, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible side length for each square plot is indeed 20 meters.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to divide the field into squares with larger side lengths.\n\nSuppose I consider a side length of 30 meters. But 30 doesn't divide 40 evenly, since 40 / 30 = 1.333..., which is not an integer. So, that's not possible.\n\nWhat about 25 meters? As I thought earlier, 40 / 25 = 1.6, which is not an integer, so that doesn't work either.\n\nWhat about 10 meters? That divides both 40 and 60 evenly, but it's smaller than 20 meters.\n\nSimilarly, 20 meters is the largest divisor of both 40 and 60, as per the GCD calculation.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible side length for each square plot is 20 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
