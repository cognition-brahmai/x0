        "content": "In environmental economics, the term for the cost of an economic activity that is borne by third parties and not accounted for in the price of goods or services is called an external cost.\n\nSo, to break it down, when a company produces goods or provides services, there are sometimes costs that are imposed on people who are not directly involved in the transaction. These are costs that aren't reflected in the price that consumers pay for the product or service. For example, if a factory pollutes a river while producing goods, the cost of cleaning up the river or the health costs to people who use the river isn't typically included in the price of the goods produced by the factory. Those costs are borne by the community or the environment, making them external costs.\n\nLet's look at the other options to make sure we've got it right:\n\nA. Opportunity cost: This is the cost of choosing one alternative over another in terms of what you miss out on. For example, if you choose to spend your time and money on going to a movie, the opportunity cost is what you could have done instead, like reading a book or saving the money.\n\nB. Sunk cost: This is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. For example, if you buy a non-refundable ticket to a event and then decide not to go, the cost of the ticket is a sunk cost.\n\nD. Implicit cost: These are opportunity costs that represent the value of the next best alternative use of resources. For example, if you use your own building for your business instead of renting it out, the rent you could have earned is an implicit cost.\n\nSo, among these options, the one that specifically refers to costs borne by third parties not accounted for in the price is the external cost.\n\nIt's important in environmental economics because these external costs can lead to market\u5931\u7075, where the market doesn't allocate resources efficiently because it doesn't account for all the costs involved. Policies like taxes, subsidies, or regulations are sometimes used to internalize these external costs, meaning to make the producers or consumers pay for the full social cost of their activities.\n\nFor instance, a carbon tax is a way to make producers pay for the external costs associated with carbon emissions, such as contributions to climate change. By incorporating this tax into the price of goods or services that cause carbon emissions, the market price more accurately reflects the true cost of production, including the environmental impact.\n\nUnderstanding external costs is crucial for policymakers aiming to achieve sustainable and efficient economic outcomes that also consider environmental and social well-being.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
