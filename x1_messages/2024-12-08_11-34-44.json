        "content": "So the farmer starts with 20 sheep. Then it says, \"all but 8 die.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky. So, \"all but 8 die\" means that all the sheep except for 8 die. So, if the farmer had 20 sheep and all but 8 die, that means 20 minus 8 equals 12 sheep die. So, the farmer has 8 sheep left alive. Wait, but the question says, \"how many sheep does the farmer have left?\" Does that mean the farmer still owns the dead sheep? Probably not, because once they die, they're no longer part of the flock. So, the farmer has 8 living sheep left.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to interpret \"all but 8 die.\" Let me think about this again. \"All but 8 die\" could mean that only 8 sheep survive, and the rest die. So, again, that would be 8 sheep left alive. Alternatively, maybe \"all but 8\" means that all sheep except for 8 die, so the farmer has 8 sheep remaining that are alive.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other interpretation? Let's see. Could \"all but 8\" mean something different in this context? For example, maybe it's a trick question, and the \"all but 8\" refers to something else. But I don't think so. In standard language, \"all but 8\" means all except for 8.\n\nSo, if the farmer had 20 sheep and all but 8 die, that means 12 sheep die, and 8 remain alive. Therefore, the farmer has 8 sheep left.\n\nBut let's double-check this. Suppose the farmer has 20 sheep, and a disease outbreak causes all but 8 to die. So, 12 sheep die, and 8 survive. So, the farmer has 8 living sheep remaining.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to be tricky by using the word \"left,\" as in the direction, but that seems unlikely because it would be a play on words. Given that, it's probably safe to assume that \"left\" simply means remaining or surviving.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the farmer has 8 sheep left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
