        "content": "Alright, I'll help you create a simple linked list in Python. A linked list is a data structure where each element is a separate object, known as a node, which contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.\n\nFirst, we need to define a class for the nodes. Each node will have two attributes: `data` to store the value and `next` to store the reference to the next node.\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next = None\n```\n\nNext, we'll create the LinkedList class, which will have methods to add elements, remove elements by value, and print the contents of the list.\n\n```python\nclass LinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.head = None\n\n    def add_element(self, data):\n        new_node = Node(data)\n        if not self.head:\n            self.head = new_node\n        else:\n            current = self.head\n            while current.next:\n                current = current.next\n            current.next = new_node\n\n    def remove_element(self, data):\n        if not self.head:\n            return\n        if self.head.data == data:\n            self.head = self.head.next\n            return\n        current = self.head\n        while current.next:\n            if current.next.data == data:\n                current.next = current.next.next\n                return\n            current = current.next\n\n    def print_list(self):\n        current = self.head\n        while current:\n            print(current.data, end=\" -> \")\n            current = current.next\n        print(\"None\")\n```\n\nLet me explain each method:\n\n1. **add_element(self, data)**: This method adds a new node with the given data to the end of the list. If the list is empty (self.head is None), the new node becomes the head. Otherwise, it traverses the list to the end and appends the new node.\n\n2. **remove_element(self, data)**: This method removes the first node that contains the specified data. If the head node contains the data, it updates the head to the next node. Otherwise, it traverses the list to find the node before the one to be removed and updates the next reference to skip the node to be removed.\n\n3. **print_list(self)**: This method prints the data of each node in the list, starting from the head, and ends with \"None\" to indicate the end of the list.\n\nYou can use this LinkedList class to create a linked list, add elements, remove elements by value, and print the list.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this class:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ll = LinkedList()\n    ll.add_element(1)\n    ll.add_element(2)\n    ll.add_element(3)\n    ll.print_list()  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None\n    ll.remove_element(2)\n    ll.print_list()  # Output: 1 -> 3 -> None\n```\n\nThis should give you a basic understanding of how to implement a simple linked list in Python.
