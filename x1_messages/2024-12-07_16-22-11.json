        "content": "Certainly! To implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph, we can use a priority queue to efficiently select the next node with the smallest distance. Python's `heapq` module can be used to implement the priority queue.\n\nFirst, we need to represent the graph. Since the graph is undirected, we'll make sure that edges are bidirectional. We can use an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each key is a node and its value is a list of tuples, each containing a neighboring node and the weight of the edge connecting them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Graph Representation:** Use a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of tuples (neighbor, weight).\n\n2. **Priority Queue:** Use `heapq` to always expand the least cost node first.\n\n3. **Distance Tracking:** Keep a dictionary to track the shortest distance from the start node to each node.\n\n4. **Visited Set:** Track visited nodes to avoid processing them multiple times.\n\n5. **Path Reconstruction:** Keep a dictionary to track the previous node in the shortest path.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above plan:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    # Priority queue to hold nodes to visit, initialized with the start node\n    priority_queue = [(0, start)]\n    \n    # Dictionary to track the shortest distance to each node\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    \n    # Dictionary to track the previous node in the path\n    previous_nodes = {node: None for node in graph}\n    \n    while priority_queue:\n        # Get the node with the smallest distance\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        \n        # Nodes can be added to the priority queue multiple times, with different distances\n        # We only process the node if the current distance is the smallest seen so far\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n        \n        # If we reach the end node, reconstruct and return the path\n        if current_node == end:\n            path = []\n            while current_node is not None:\n                path.append(current_node)\n                current_node = previous_nodes[current_node]\n            return path[::-1]\n        \n        # Explore each neighbor of the current node\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:\n            distance = current_distance + weight\n            \n            # Only consider this new path if it's better\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node\n                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    # If no path is found\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\ngraph = {\n    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],\n    'B': [('A', 1), ('C', 2), ('D', 5)],\n    'C': [('A', 4), ('B', 2), ('D', 1)],\n    'D': [('B', 5), ('C', 1)]\n}\n\nprint(shortest_path(graph, 'A', 'D'))  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Graph Representation:** The graph is represented as a dictionary where each key is a node, and its value is a list of tuples, each containing a neighboring node and the weight of the edge.\n   \n2. **Priority Queue:** We use a heap to always expand the node with the smallest distance first.\n   \n3. **Distance Tracking:** We maintain a dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance from the start node to each node.\n   \n4. **Path Reconstruction:** We keep track of the previous node in the shortest path to reconstruct the path once the end node is reached.\n\nThis implementation ensures that we find the shortest path efficiently using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n"
