        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a pack of pens that normally costs $6. There's a 20% discount on it, and after that discount, there's a 5% sales tax applied. We need to find out the final cost of the pack.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the discount. A 20% discount on $6 means I have to find what 20% of 6 is and then subtract that from the original price.\n\nSo, 20% of 6 is calculated as:\n\n20% * 6 = (20/100) * 6 = 0.2 * 6 = 1.2\n\nSo, the discount is $1.2. Now, subtract that from the original price:\n\n6 - 1.2 = 4.8\n\nSo, after the discount, the pack costs $4.8.\n\nNext, we have to apply a 5% sales tax on this discounted price. So, I need to find 5% of $4.8 and add it to the discounted price.\n\nFirst, calculate 5% of 4.8:\n\n5% * 4.8 = (5/100) * 4.8 = 0.05 * 4.8 = 0.24\n\nSo, the sales tax is $0.24. Now, add that to the discounted price:\n\n4.8 + 0.24 = 5.04\n\nTherefore, the final cost of the pack of pens is $5.04.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with $6, a 20% discount:\n\n20% of 6 is 1.2, so 6 - 1.2 = 4.8.\n\nThen, 5% sales tax on 4.8 is 0.24, so 4.8 + 0.24 = 5.04.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that sometimes you can multiply the original price by (1 - discount percentage) to get the discounted price. Let's see if that works.\n\nSo, (1 - 20%) = 80%, which is 0.8.\n\nSo, 6 * 0.8 = 4.8. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, to apply the sales tax, you can multiply the discounted price by (1 + sales tax percentage).\n\nSo, (1 + 5%) = 1.05.\n\nSo, 4.8 * 1.05 = 4.8 + (0.05 * 4.8) = 4.8 + 0.24 = 5.04.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to apply the discount first and then the tax, which is what I did, or sometimes you might consider the order, but in this case, it's discount first, then tax, as per the problem statement.\n\nSo, I think $5.04 is the correct final cost.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe applying the tax first and then the discount, but the problem clearly says the discount is applied first, followed by the tax.\n\nAlternatively, some places might combine the discount and tax in different ways, but based on the information given, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be $5.04.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.04} \\]"
