        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. I understand that I'm supposed to draw a ball, note its color, and put it back, repeating this process two more times, so three draws in total. I need to find the probability of drawing a red ball exactly twice in those three draws.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the probability of drawing a red ball in a single draw. Since there are 5 red balls out of 8 total balls, the probability of drawing a red ball is 5/8. Similarly, the probability of drawing a blue ball is 3/8.\n\nNow, since I'm drawing the ball with replacement, each draw is independent of the others. That means the outcome of one draw doesn't affect the outcomes of the other draws.\n\nI need to find the probability of getting exactly two red balls in three draws. This sounds like a binomial probability problem. The formula for binomial probability is:\n\nP(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials.\n\n- C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\n- n is the number of trials.\n\n- k is the number of successes.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- n = 3 (since there are three draws)\n\n- k = 2 (we want exactly two red balls)\n\n- p = 5/8 (probability of drawing a red ball)\n\nSo, plugging these values into the formula:\n\nP(2) = C(3,2) * (5/8)^2 * (3/8)^(3-2)\n\nFirst, I need to calculate C(3,2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 successes out of 3 trials. I know that C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), so:\n\nC(3,2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = (6) / (2 * 1) = 3\n\nNext, (5/8)^2 = 25/64\n\nThen, (3/8)^(3-2) = (3/8)^1 = 3/8\n\nNow, multiplying them all together:\n\nP(2) = 3 * (25/64) * (3/8) = 3 * (75/512) = 225/512\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly two red balls in three draws is 225/512.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it in another way to confirm.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to list all possible sequences where there are exactly two red balls and one blue ball in three draws.\n\nThe possible sequences are:\n\n1. Red, Red, Blue\n\n2. Red, Blue, Red\n\n3. Blue, Red, Red\n\nEach of these sequences has the same probability, since the draws are independent.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of one sequence, say Red, Red, Blue.\n\nProbability of Red on first draw: 5/8\n\nProbability of Red on second draw: 5/8\n\nProbability of Blue on third draw: 3/8\n\nSo, the probability of this sequence is (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) = 75/512\n\nSince there are three such sequences, the total probability is 3 * 75/512 = 225/512\n\nThis matches what I got earlier using the binomial formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability using permutations.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange two reds and one blue in three draws is 3 choose 2, which is 3, as I calculated before.\n\nSo, again, probability is 3 * (5/8)^2 * (3/8)^1 = 225/512\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any dependency between draws that I might have missed? No, since it's with replacement, each draw is independent.\n\nAre there any constraints or additional information I should consider? The problem seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the probability is 225/512.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{225}{512}} \\]"
