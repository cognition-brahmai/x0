        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. Tom is twice as old as Jerry, and Jerry is 5 years younger than Alice. Alice is 25 years old, and I need to find out how old Tom will be in 10 years.\n\nFirst, I should figure out Jerry's age. Since Jerry is 5 years younger than Alice, and Alice is 25, Jerry must be 25 - 5 = 20 years old.\n\nNow, Tom is twice as old as Jerry. So, if Jerry is 20, then Tom is 2 * 20 = 40 years old.\n\nThe question asks how old Tom will be in 10 years. So, if Tom is currently 40, in 10 years he will be 40 + 10 = 50 years old.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Alice is 25, Jerry is 20, Tom is 40. In 10 years, Alice will be 35, Jerry will be 30, and Tom will be 50. Does that make sense? Yeah, Tom is always twice Jerry's age. In 10 years, twice Jerry's age would be twice 30, which is 60, but wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.\n\nIf Jerry is currently 20, and Tom is twice that, so 40, in 10 years, Jerry will be 30, and Tom will be 50. But according to the relationship, Tom should always be twice as old as Jerry. But 50 is not twice 30. So there must be something wrong with my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the relationship doesn't hold in the future. Maybe Tom is only twice as old as Jerry right now, not in the future. The problem says \"Tom is twice as old as Jerry\" without specifying a time frame, so probably it's about their current ages.\n\nSo, if Tom is currently 40 and Jerry is currently 20, in 10 years, Tom will be 50 and Jerry will be 30. Even though Tom isn't twice as old as Jerry in the future, the problem only states the current relationship.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"Tom is twice as old as Jerry. Jerry is 5 years younger than Alice. If Alice is 25 years old, how old will Tom be in 10 years?\"\n\nYes, it's about current ages with a future projection for Tom. So my calculation seems correct. Tom is currently 40, and in 10 years, he'll be 50.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating it by thinking that the relationship should hold in the future. The problem only gives current relationships, so unless specified otherwise, it's about their current ages.\n\nI think 50 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
