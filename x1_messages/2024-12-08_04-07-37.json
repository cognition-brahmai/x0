        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of pens: Type A and Type B. The price of Type A is twice that of Type B. Then, someone buys 10 Type A pens and 20 Type B pens for a total of $90. We need to find out the price of each type of pen.\n\nFirst, let's assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say the price of a Type B pen is \\( b \\) dollars. Since Type A is twice that, the price of a Type A pen would be \\( 2b \\) dollars.\n\nNow, the person buys 10 Type A pens and 20 Type B pens for $90. So, the total cost can be represented as:\n\n\\( 10 \\times 2b + 20 \\times b = 90 \\)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( 20b + 20b = 90 \\)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, 10 Type A pens at \\( 2b \\) each would be \\( 10 \\times 2b = 20b \\), and 20 Type B pens at \\( b \\) each would be \\( 20 \\times b = 20b \\). So, together, that's \\( 20b + 20b = 40b = 90 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 40b = 90 \\). To find \\( b \\), divide both sides by 40:\n\n\\( b = \\frac{90}{40} = 2.25 \\)\n\nTherefore, the price of a Type B pen is $2.25, and since Type A is twice that, it's \\( 2 \\times 2.25 = 4.50 \\) dollars.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If Type A is $4.50 and Type B is $2.25, then 10 Type A pens would cost \\( 10 \\times 4.50 = 45 \\) dollars, and 20 Type B pens would cost \\( 20 \\times 2.25 = 45 \\) dollars. Together, that's \\( 45 + 45 = 90 \\) dollars, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, the prices are:\n\n- Type A pen: $4.50\n\n- Type B pen: $2.25\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Type A: } \\$4.50, \\text{ Type B: } \\$2.25} \\]"
