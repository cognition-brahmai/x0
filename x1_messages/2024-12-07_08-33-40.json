        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 socks in total: 4 red, 4 blue, and 4 green. I need to find the probability of picking two socks of the same color without looking.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of ways to pick any two socks from the 12. That sounds like a combination problem, where order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 socks from 12 is C(12, 2). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, there are 66 possible pairs of socks.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to pick two socks of the same color. There are three colors: red, blue, and green. I'll calculate the number of ways to pick two red socks, two blue socks, and two green socks, and then add them up.\n\nStarting with red socks: there are 4 red socks, so the number of ways to pick 2 red socks is C(4, 2).\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2!)) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 6.\n\nSimilarly, for blue socks: C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nAnd for green socks: C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick two socks of the same color is 6 (red) + 6 (blue) + 6 (green) = 18.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a matching pair is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, probability = 18 / 66.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6: 18 \u00f7 6 = 3, and 66 \u00f7 6 = 11.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/11.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking any sock doesn't matter because we have to pick two socks.\n\nSo, the first sock can be any color. Then, the second sock has to match the first one.\n\nAfter picking the first sock, there are 11 socks left in the drawer.\n\nIf the first sock was red, there are 3 red socks left out of 11.\n\nSimilarly, if the first sock was blue, there are 3 blue socks left out of 11.\n\nAnd the same for green.\n\nBut since the first sock can be any color, I need to consider the overall probability.\n\nLet me calculate it this way:\n\nProbability = (probability of first sock being red and second being red) + (probability of first being blue and second being blue) + (probability of first being green and second being green).\n\nThe probability of picking a red sock first is 4/12.\n\nThen, picking another red sock is 3/11.\n\nSo, (4/12) \u00d7 (3/11) = (1/3) \u00d7 (3/11) = 1/11.\n\nSimilarly, for blue: (4/12) \u00d7 (3/11) = 1/11.\n\nAnd for green: (4/12) \u00d7 (3/11) = 1/11.\n\nAdding them up: 1/11 + 1/11 + 1/11 = 3/11.\n\nSo, again, the probability is 3/11.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but I think there's another way to think about it.\n\nSuppose I pick the first sock, and it's a certain color.\n\nThen, the probability that the second sock matches the first one is the number of remaining socks of that color divided by the total remaining socks.\n\nSince there are 4 socks of each color, after picking one, there are 3 left of that color and 11 socks in total.\n\nSo, the probability that the second sock matches the first is 3/11.\n\nBut wait, this seems different from my previous calculation.\n\nWait, no, this is actually the same.\n\nBecause in this approach, the first sock can be any color, and the probability of the second sock matching it is 3/11.\n\nSo, the overall probability is 3/11.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation of 18/66 = 3/11.\n\nGood, it's consistent.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that the socks are identical within each color, or does it matter?\n\nIn this problem, I don't think it matters because we're only concerned with the color for matching.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that the socks are picked without looking, so we're dealing with random selection.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of possible pairs and the number of matching pairs.\n\nWe already did that and got 18 matching pairs out of 66 total pairs, which is 18/66 = 3/11.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the first sock and then the second sock, the probability is also 3/11, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, I think 3/11 is the correct probability.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or if we're double-counting.\n\nIn the first approach, where we calculated C(4, 2) for each color and added them up, there's no overlap because each color is distinct.\n\nSo, I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total number of ways to pick two socks of the same color, it's indeed 6 for each color, totaling 18.\n\nAnd the total number of ways to pick any two socks is 66.\n\nSo, 18/66 = 3/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a matching pair is 3/11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{11}} \\]"
