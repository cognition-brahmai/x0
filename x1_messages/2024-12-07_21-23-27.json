        "content": "Let's dive into this problem using set theory. We have a class of 30 students, and they're studying different languages: French and Spanish. Some are studying both. I need to find out how many are studying neither.\n\nFirst, I should recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion because it's useful for counting elements in overlapping sets.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- Let F be the set of students studying French.\n\n- Let S be the set of students studying Spanish.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |F| = 20 (students studying French)\n\n- |S| = 18 (students studying Spanish)\n\n- |F \u2229 S| = 12 (students studying both languages)\n\n- Total students, |U| = 30 (universe)\n\nWe need to find the number of students studying neither language, which is the complement of the set of students studying either French or Spanish or both. In set notation, that's |U - (F \u222a S)| or equivalently |U| - |F \u222a S|.\n\nFirst, I need to find |F \u222a S|, the number of students studying either French or Spanish or both.\n\nAccording to the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|F \u222a S| = |F| + |S| - |F \u2229 S|\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|F \u222a S| = 20 + 18 - 12 = 26\n\nSo, 26 students are studying at least one of the two languages.\n\nNow, to find the number of students studying neither, I subtract this from the total number of students:\n\n|U| - |F \u222a S| = 30 - 26 = 4\n\nTherefore, 4 students are studying neither French nor Spanish.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nI can think in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents French students, the other represents Spanish students.\n\n- The overlap, |F \u2229 S|, is 12 students.\n\n- The number of students studying only French is |F| - |F \u2229 S| = 20 - 12 = 8\n\n- The number of students studying only Spanish is |S| - |F \u2229 S| = 18 - 12 = 6\n\n- So, only French: 8, only Spanish: 6, both: 12\n\nAdding these up: 8 + 6 + 12 = 26 students studying at least one language.\n\nTotal students are 30, so 30 - 26 = 4 studying neither.\n\nHmm, same answer as before. That gives me more confidence.\n\nBut let me consider if there could be any students counted differently. For example, are there students who might not be in either set? Well, according to the problem, the universe is 30 students, and the sets are subsets of this universe.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the inclusion-exclusion principle again, but this time considering the complement.\n\nThe formula for the number of students studying neither is:\n\n|U| - |F \u222a S| = |U| - (|F| + |S| - |F \u2229 S|)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n30 - (20 + 18 - 12) = 30 - 26 = 4\n\nAgain, 4 students.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the students studying neither as those not in F or S, which is the complement of F \u222a S.\n\nBy De Morgan's law, the complement of (F \u222a S) is F' \u2229 S', where F' is the complement of F, and S' is the complement of S.\n\nBut directly calculating it as |U| - |F \u222a S| is simpler.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently from different angles.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of error in the given numbers.\n\nTotal students studying French, |F| = 20\n\nTotal studying Spanish, |S| = 18\n\nBoth, |F \u2229 S| = 12\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nWell, the number of students studying only French is 20 - 12 = 8\n\nOnly Spanish is 18 - 12 = 6\n\nBoth is 12\n\nAdding them up: 8 + 6 + 12 = 26, which is less than 30, so 4 students are studying neither.\n\nI don't see any inconsistency here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use a table:\n\n- Only French: 8\n\n- Only Spanish: 6\n\n- Both: 12\n\n- Neither: x\n\nTotal: 30\n\nSo, 8 + 6 + 12 + x = 30\n\n26 + x = 30\n\nx = 4\n\nAgain, 4 students studying neither.\n\nI think it's clear that the answer is 4.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there could be students studying other subjects that might affect this count. The problem specifically mentions students studying French and Spanish, and we're to find those studying neither of these languages. So, other subjects don't come into play here.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any students studying only one language and not the other, but that's already accounted for in the numbers given.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that 4 students are studying neither French nor Spanish.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
