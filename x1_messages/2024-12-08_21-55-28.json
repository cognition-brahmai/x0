The city has 10,000 streetlights, each consuming 150 watts of power per hour and operating for an average of 12 hours per day. Calculate the total energy consumption of the current streetlights and the potential energy savings if all streetlights are replaced with solar-powered alternatives. Also, estimate the cost of replacing all streetlights, assuming that each solar-powered streetlight costs $1,200."

        "content": "So the city has 10,000 streetlights, each using 150 watts per hour, and they're on for 12 hours a day. First, I need to calculate the total energy consumption of these current streetlights.\n\nAlright, energy consumption is usually measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). So, I'll need to convert the watts to kilowatts. There are 1,000 watts in a kilowatt, right? So, 150 watts is 0.15 kilowatts.\n\nNow, each streetlight uses 0.15 kW per hour, and they're on for 12 hours a day. So, daily energy consumption per streetlight is:\n\n0.15 kW/hour * 12 hours = 1.8 kWh per day.\n\nNow, for 10,000 streetlights, the total daily energy consumption would be:\n\n1.8 kWh/day * 10,000 = 18,000 kWh per day.\n\nTo find the annual energy consumption, I'll multiply that by the number of days in a year, which is typically 365:\n\n18,000 kWh/day * 365 days/year = 6,570,000 kWh per year.\n\nSo, the current streetlights consume 6,570,000 kWh per year.\n\nNow, if the city replaces all of these with solar-powered streetlights, assuming they don't consume grid energy, the potential energy savings would be equal to the current consumption, which is 6,570,000 kWh per year.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the cost of replacing all streetlights with solar-powered ones. Each solar-powered streetlight costs $1,200.\n\nSo, for 10,000 streetlights, the total cost would be:\n\n10,000 * $1,200 = $12,000,000.\n\nThat's the total cost of replacement.\n\nBut, I should probably consider if there are any additional costs or savings over time. For example, maintenance costs might be reduced with solar-powered lights, since they might have fewer moving parts or require less maintenance compared to traditional streetlights.\n\nAlso, there might be savings on energy bills since the solar lights don't use grid energy. However, the question only asks for the energy consumption, potential energy savings, and the cost of replacement, so I'll stick to those.\n\nWait, but the question mentions reducing maintenance costs, so maybe I should look into that briefly.\n\nIf solar-powered streetlights have lower maintenance costs, then over time, the city could save money on maintenance, which might offset the initial high cost of replacement.\n\nHowever, since the question doesn't ask for a cost-benefit analysis or payback period, I'll just focus on the asked parameters.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Total energy consumption of current streetlights: 6,570,000 kWh per year.\n\n- Potential energy savings by replacing with solar-powered streetlights: 6,570,000 kWh per year.\n\n- Cost of replacing all streetlights: $12,000,000.\n\nI think that covers it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6,570,000 \\text{ kWh per year}, \\$12,000,000} \\]"
