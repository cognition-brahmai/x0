It's a popular and exciting game in the wizarding world, involving two teams of seven players each. The objective is to score points by throwing the Quaffle through three hoops mounted on poles while also trying to catch the Golden Snitch to secure an additional 150 points and end the game. The sport is deeply ingrained in the school's culture and is a significant part of the students' lives."
