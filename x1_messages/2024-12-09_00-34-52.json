Completed in 1889, it was built for the Exposition Universelle, a world's fair held to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the French Revolution. The tower was named after its designer, Gustave Eiffel, and it's often affectionately called \"La Dame de Fer,\" which means \"The Iron Lady\" in French. It's not only an iconic landmark but also serves as a radio tower and attracts millions of visitors each year."
