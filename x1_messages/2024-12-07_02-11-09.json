        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. There's a man with 53 socks in his drawer: 21 blue, 15 black, and 17 red. The room is dark, so he can't see the colors. He needs to take out the minimum number of socks to ensure he has at least one matching pair. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's not just any pair; it has to be a matching pair, meaning two socks of the same color. And it's about finding the minimum number he needs to take out to guarantee that he gets at least one matching pair.\n\nLet me think about this. If he picks out one sock, it could be any color: blue, black, or red. But he needs a pair, which means a second sock of the same color. So, if he picks out two socks, is that enough to guarantee a matching pair? Well, it's possible that the two socks are different colors, right? For example, one blue and one black. So, two socks aren't enough to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nWhat if he picks three socks? Let's see. If he picks three socks, possible combinations could be all three the same color, which would definitely give him a matching pair, or two of one color and one of another. In the latter case, he still has a matching pair from the two that are the same color. So, it seems like picking three socks would guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to have three socks without a matching pair? Hmm, if he picks one blue, one black, and one red, then he has three socks, none of which match each other. So, in that case, he doesn't have a matching pair. That means that picking three socks doesn't guarantee a matching pair, because there's a possibility that all three are different colors.\n\nSo, what's the solution here? If he picks four socks, what's the possibility? If he picks four socks, even if the first three are all different colors, the fourth sock must match one of the first three, because there are only three colors available. So, in the worst-case scenario, the first three socks are blue, black, and red, and the fourth sock he picks must be one of those colors, thus matching one of the first three.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks he needs to take out to ensure he has at least one matching pair is four.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. The problem is about ensuring at least one matching pair, and I've concluded that four socks are needed. But maybe there's a better way to think about it.\n\nLet's consider the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this context, the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors, and the \"pigeons\" are the socks.\n\nThere are three colors (pigeonholes): blue, black, and red. If he picks four socks (pigeons), then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must have at least two socks, because 4 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder of 1, meaning that at least one color has at least two socks.\n\nSo, this confirms that four socks are sufficient to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nBut is there a way to do it with fewer than four socks? Well, as I thought earlier, with three socks, it's possible to have one of each color, without any matching pair. So, three socks don't guarantee a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is indeed four.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose he picks two socks of different colors first, say one blue and one black. Then, the next sock he picks could be red, which still doesn't give him a matching pair. Wait, no, if he picks a third sock and it's red, he has one blue, one black, and one red, still no matching pair.\n\nBut, as I thought before, on the fourth sock, he must get a second sock of one of the colors he already has, thus forming a matching pair.\n\nSo, yes, four is the minimum number he needs to take out to ensure at least one matching pair.\n\nI think that's the answer: four socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
