        "content": "So John can paint a house in 5 days, and Mike can do it in 3 days. We want to know how long it will take them to paint the house together. Hmm, this seems like a problem about working together and combining rates. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to figure out how much of the house each person can paint in one day. That way, I can see how much they can do together in a day and then find out how many days it would take for them to finish the whole house.\n\nSo, John can paint the whole house in 5 days. That means, in one day, he can paint 1/5 of the house. Similarly, Mike can paint the whole house in 3 days, so in one day, he can paint 1/3 of the house.\n\nNow, if they work together, their rates should add up. So, in one day, together they can paint 1/5 plus 1/3 of the house.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1/5 plus 1/3. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 3 is 15. So, 1/5 is 3/15 and 1/3 is 5/15. Adding them up, 3/15 plus 5/15 equals 8/15. So together, they can paint 8/15 of the house in one day.\n\nNow, to find out how many days it will take them to paint the whole house, I need to divide the whole house (which is 1) by the amount they can paint in one day (which is 8/15). So, 1 divided by 8/15 is the same as 1 multiplied by 15/8, which is 15/8 days.\n\n15/8 days is the same as 1 day and 7/8 of a day. But maybe it's better to leave it as 15/8 days, or I could convert it to decimal form. 15 divided by 8 is 1.875 days.\n\nSo, together, John and Mike can paint the house in 15/8 days or 1.875 days.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's see. John takes 5 days alone, Mike takes 3 days alone, and together they take less time, which makes sense. But is 1.875 days the correct answer?\n\nLet me check another way. Maybe I can use the formula for combined work rates. I think there's a formula like 1/(1/a + 1/b), where a and b are the times each person takes to do the job alone.\n\nSo, in this case, a is 5 days and b is 3 days. Plugging into the formula: 1/(1/5 + 1/3). We already did that and got 15/8 days, so that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of another formula: (a*b)/(a+b). Let's try that with a=5 and b=3. So, (5*3)/(5+3) = 15/8 days. Again, the same result.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me 15/8 days. That should be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it in terms of work done per day.\n\nJohn does 1/5 per day, Mike does 1/3 per day. Together, 1/5 + 1/3 = 8/15 per day. So, to complete 1 house, time = 1 / (8/15) = 15/8 days. Same as before.\n\nI think it's solid. They can paint the house together in 15/8 days, or 1.875 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{8} \\text{ days}} \\]"
