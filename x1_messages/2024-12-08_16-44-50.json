        "content": "So I've got this problem here about two trains leaving Town A and Town B at the same time, going towards each other. Train from Town A is going at 60 mph, and the one from Town B at 90 mph. The distance between the towns is 300 miles. I need to find out when they'll pass each other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other. That makes sense because they're coming from opposite directions.\n\nSo, the combined speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 150 miles per hour.\n\nThe total distance between the towns is 300 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 300 miles / 150 mph = 2 hours\n\nSo, it looks like they'll meet after 2 hours.\n\nNow, since both trains left at 3:00 PM, I just need to add 2 hours to that time.\n\n3:00 PM + 2 hours = 5:00 PM\n\nTherefore, the trains will pass each other at 5:00 PM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to think about how far each train travels in that time and see if it adds up to 300 miles.\n\nTrain from Town A: 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nTrain from Town B: 90 mph * 2 hours = 180 miles\n\nTotal distance covered: 120 + 180 = 300 miles\n\nYes, that matches the total distance between the towns. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up equations based on the positions of the trains over time.\n\nLet's denote the time in hours since they started moving as t.\n\nThe position of the train from Town A after t hours is: 60t miles away from Town A, towards Town B.\n\nThe position of the train from Town B after t hours is: 300 - 90t miles away from Town A, since it's moving towards Town A.\n\nThey pass each other when their positions are equal:\n\n60t = 300 - 90t\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n60t + 90t = 300\n\n150t = 300\n\nt = 300 / 150\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nAgain, the same result. That gives me more confidence.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the speeds were different or the distance was different. The approach would be the same: add their speeds if they're moving towards each other, and then divide the total distance by that combined speed to find the time.\n\nIn this case, everything checks out.\n\nSo, final answer: 5:00 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5:00 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
