The expression is:\n\n((3^2 - 4) * 5 + 8) / 2\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponent:\n\n3^2 is 9.\n\nSo now it's:\n\n((9 - 4) * 5 + 8) / 2\n\nNext, subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\n9 - 4 is 5.\n\nNow it's:\n\n(5 * 5 + 8) / 2\n\nThen, multiplication:\n\n5 * 5 is 25.\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(25 + 8) / 2\n\nAddition next:\n\n25 + 8 is 33.\n\nNow it's:\n\n33 / 2\n\nFinally, division:\n\n33 divided by 2 is 16.5.\n\nSo the answer is 16.5."
