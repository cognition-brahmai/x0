        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a group of 6 men and 5 women, and we need to form a committee of 4 people. The question is asking for the probability that this committee will have exactly 2 men and 2 women. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is having exactly 2 men and 2 women in the committee, and the total possible outcomes are all the different ways we can choose 4 people from the group of 11 people (6 men + 5 women).\n\nSo, the formula for probability here would be:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 2 men and 2 women) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 people from 11)\n\nI think I need to use combinations here because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. Combinations are denoted by \"n choose k\", which is written as C(n, k) or sometimes as nCk, and it's calculated as n! / (k!(n - k)!), where \"!\" means factorial.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 4 people from 11 is C(11, 4).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 men from 6 is C(6, 2), and the number of ways to choose 2 women from 5 is C(5, 2). Since these are independent events, I need to multiply them together to get the number of ways to choose 2 men and 2 women.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be:\n\nProbability = [C(6, 2) * C(5, 2)] / C(11, 4)\n\nNow, let's calculate each of these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(6, 2):\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6 - 2)!) = (6 * 5 * 4!) / (2 * 1 * 4!) = (6 * 5) / 2 = 15\n\nNext, C(5, 2):\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (2 * 1 * 3!)) = (5 * 4) / 2 = 10\n\nNow, C(11, 4):\n\nC(11, 4) = 11! / (4!(11 - 4)!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7!) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 7!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / 24\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n11 * 10 = 110\n\n110 * 9 = 990\n\n990 * 8 = 7920\n\nNow, 7920 divided by 24:\n\n24 * 330 = 7920, so C(11, 4) = 330\n\nNow, plug these back into the probability formula:\n\nProbability = (15 * 10) / 330 = 150 / 330\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 30:\n\n150 \u00f7 30 = 5\n\n330 \u00f7 30 = 11\n\nSo, the probability is 5/11.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, C(6, 2) = 15, that seems correct.\n\nC(5, 2) = 10, that's also correct.\n\nC(11, 4) = 330, let me verify that again.\n\n11! / (4! * 7!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 7920 / 24 = 330. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, 15 * 10 = 150, and 150 / 330 = 5/11.\n\nHmm, but intuitively, with 6 men and 5 women, choosing 2 of each seems pretty likely, and 5/11 seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to choose 4 people from 11 is C(11, 4) = 330, as calculated.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes: choosing 2 men out of 6 and 2 women out of 5.\n\nC(6, 2) = 15, C(5, 2) = 10, so 15 * 10 = 150 favorable ways.\n\nTherefore, Probability = 150 / 330 = 5/11.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of sequential selection, but that might be more complicated.\n\nFor example, the probability of selecting 2 men and 2 women in a specific order, like man, man, woman, woman.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, it's better to use combinations as I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability using permutations, but it should give the same result.\n\nLet me see: total number of ways to choose 4 people from 11 is C(11, 4) = 330.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 men from 6 is C(6, 2) = 15.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 women from 5 is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nSo, total favorable ways are 15 * 10 = 150.\n\nTherefore, Probability = 150 / 330 = 5/11.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFirst, select 2 men out of 6: probability is C(6, 2) / C(11, 2).\n\nThen, select 2 women out of the remaining 5 women and 4 men: C(5, 2) / C(9, 2).\n\nBut that seems more complicated and might lead to the same result.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nFirst, select 2 men out of 6 from the total 11 people.\n\nC(6, 2) / C(11, 2) = 15 / 55 = 3/11.\n\nThen, select 2 women out of the remaining 5 women and 4 men, which is C(5, 2) / C(9, 2) = 10 / 36 = 5/18.\n\nNow, multiply these probabilities: 3/11 * 5/18 = 15 / 198 = 5 / 66.\n\nWait, that's different from 5/11. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. When selecting sequentially like this, I need to consider that the order of selection doesn't matter in the committee.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use conditional probability.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nTotal ways to choose 4 people: C(11, 4) = 330.\n\nNumber of ways to choose exactly 2 men and 2 women: C(6, 2) * C(5, 2) = 15 * 10 = 150.\n\nTherefore, Probability = 150 / 330 = 5/11.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nProbability = [Number of ways to choose 2 men from 6 and 2 women from 5] / [Total ways to choose 4 people from 11]\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the sequential approach I tried earlier is incorrect because I'm not accounting for the different orders in which the selections can be made.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the hypergeometric distribution, which deals with sampling without replacement.\n\nIn hypergeometric distribution, the probability of k successes (in this case, selecting men or women) in n draws (selecting 4 people) from a finite population of size N (11 people) that contains exactly K successes (6 men or 5 women), without replacement.\n\nThe formula for hypergeometric probability is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nIn this problem:\n\nN = 11 (total people)\n\nK = 6 (men)\n\nn = 4 (committee size)\n\nk = 2 (men in committee)\n\nSo, P(exactly 2 men) = [C(6, 2) * C(5, 2)] / C(11, 4) = (15 * 10) / 330 = 150 / 330 = 5/11\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, since the total probability should sum to 1, I can check if this makes sense.\n\nPossible numbers of men in the committee: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nBut given that there are only 5 women, the committee can have at most 5 women, but since the committee is of size 4, it's possible to have 0 to 4 men.\n\nBut in this specific case, we only care about exactly 2 men and 2 women.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach, I think 5/11 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate it or think of it in terms of percentages.\n\nTotal committees: 330\n\nFavorable committees: 150\n\nSo, 150 out of 330 is approximately 45.45%\n\nBut 5/11 is approximately 0.4545 or 45.45%, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of picking one person at a time and calculating the probability step by step, but that might be more complicated without considering the combinations.\n\nFor example:\n\nProbability of selecting a man first: 6/11\n\nThen, selecting another man: 5/10\n\nThen, selecting a woman: 5/9\n\nThen, selecting another woman: 4/8\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (man, man, woman, woman) is (6/11) * (5/10) * (5/9) * (4/8)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(6/11) * (5/10) = (6*5)/(11*10) = 30/110 = 3/11\n\nThen, (3/11) * (5/9) = 15/99\n\nThen, (15/99) * (4/8) = (15*4)/(99*8) = 60/792 = 5/66\n\nSo, the probability of selecting man, man, woman, woman in that order is 5/66.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, we need to consider all the possible orders in which 2 men and 2 women can be selected.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange 2 men and 2 women is C(4, 2) = 6 (since it's the same as choosing positions for the men or women).\n\nTherefore, total probability = 6 * (5/66) = 30/66 = 5/11\n\nSo, again, we get 5/11.\n\nThis matches the earlier result using combinations.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/11.\n\nAlternatively, to cross-verify, let's calculate the probability using another method.\n\nTotal ways to choose 4 people: C(11, 4) = 330\n\nNumber of ways to choose exactly 2 men and 2 women: C(6, 2)*C(5, 2) = 15*10 = 150\n\nTherefore, Probability = 150/330 = 5/11\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of conditional probability.\n\nProbability of selecting 2 men and 2 women = Probability of selecting 2 men first and then 2 women, plus probability of selecting 1 man, 1 woman, then 1 man, 1 woman, etc.\n\nBut that would be more complicated and time-consuming.\n\nGiven that all these approaches lead to the same answer, I'm confident that 5/11 is the correct probability.\n\nSo, the probability that the committee will have exactly 2 men and 2 women is 5/11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{11}} \\]"
