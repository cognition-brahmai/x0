        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a company that sells 5 different products, and each product has a certain probability of being purchased by a customer. Specifically, the probabilities are:\n\n- Product A: 30%\n\n- Product B: 25%\n\n- Product C: 20%\n\n- Product D: 15%\n\n- Product E: 10%\n\nAnd the scenario is that a customer buys only one product. The question is asking for the probability that the customer purchases either Product B or Product D.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. It says the customer buys only one product, and I need to find the probability that this single purchase is either B or D.\n\nSince the customer is buying only one product, and the probabilities given are for each individual product, I can assume that these probabilities are mutually exclusive. That means the customer can't buy more than one product, so the probability of buying one specific product doesn't affect the probability of buying another.\n\nIn probability theory, if I have two mutually exclusive events, the probability that either one or the other occurs is simply the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, in this case, the probability of buying Product B or Product D would be the sum of the probability of buying B and the probability of buying D.\n\nGiven that:\n\nP(B) = 25%\n\nP(D) = 15%\n\nTherefore, P(B or D) = P(B) + P(D) = 25% + 15% = 40%\n\nWait a minute, is it really that straightforward? Let me double-check.\n\nI remember that for any two events, the probability of either occurring is given by:\n\nP(B or D) = P(B) + P(D) - P(B and D)\n\nBut in this case, since the customer is buying only one product, it's impossible for them to buy both B and D at the same time. Therefore, P(B and D) = 0%.\n\nSo, P(B or D) = 25% + 15% - 0% = 40%\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of the individual probabilities adding up to 100%, since one of the five products must be purchased, given that the customer buys only one product.\n\nLet's check that:\n\nP(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) + P(E) = 30% + 25% + 20% + 15% + 10% = 100%\n\nGood, that checks out.\n\nSo, the probability of buying either B or D is indeed 40%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any chance that the customer doesn't buy any product at all. However, the problem states that the customer buys only one product, so I can assume that the purchase is definite, and it's just a matter of which product is chosen.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
