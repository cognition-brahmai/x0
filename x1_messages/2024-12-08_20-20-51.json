        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem: a train travels at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour for 3 hours and 15 minutes. I need to find out how far it travels. Okay, so distance, speed, and time are related by the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nI know the speed is 80 km/h, and the time is 3 hours and 15 minutes. But, I need to make sure that the units for time are compatible with the speed units. Since speed is in kilometers per hour, time should be in hours.\n\nFirst, I need to convert 3 hours and 15 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is:\n\n15 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.25 hours\n\nSo, total time in hours is:\n\n3 hours + 0.25 hours = 3.25 hours\n\nNow, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDistance = 80 km/h \u00d7 3.25 hours\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n80 \u00d7 3.25\n\nI can break this down:\n\n80 \u00d7 3 = 240\n\n80 \u00d7 0.25 = 20\n\nSo, 240 + 20 = 260\n\nTherefore, the train travels 260 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the time entirely into minutes. 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 15 minutes, so 195 minutes total. Then, since speed is 80 km/h, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can find the distance by:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 (Time in minutes) / 60\n\nSo:\n\nDistance = 80 km/h \u00d7 195 minutes / 60 minutes/hour\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n195 \u00f7 60 = 3.25\n\nSo, again, 80 \u00d7 3.25 = 260 km\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: in one hour, the train travels 80 kilometers. So in 3 hours, it would travel:\n\n3 \u00d7 80 = 240 km\n\nThen, in 15 minutes, which is a quarter of an hour, it would travel:\n\n80 km/h \u00d7 0.25 h = 20 km\n\nAdding those together: 240 km + 20 km = 260 km\n\nSame answer again. Seems consistent.\n\nI think 260 kilometers is the correct distance the train travels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{260} \\]"
