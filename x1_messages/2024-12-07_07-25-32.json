        "content": "Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861, until his assassination on April 15, 1865. He led the country through its greatest internal crisis, the American Civil War, preserving the Union and ending slavery. His vice president during his first term was Hannibal Hamlin, but for his second term, Andrew Johnson was his running mate.\n\nAndrew Johnson served as the 17th President of the United States from April 15, 1865, to March 4, 1869, after Lincoln's assassination. Johnson was a Democrat who became Lincoln's vice president in his second term as part of a national unity ticket. He was the only sitting vice president to assume the presidency during the Civil War.\n\nSo, the president who served during the Civil War and was Lincoln's vice president is Andrew Johnson."
