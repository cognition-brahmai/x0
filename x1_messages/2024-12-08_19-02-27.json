        "content": "D. Potential overshadowing of traditional sports by e-sports.\n\nExplanation: The paragraph mentions that e-sports have seen a \"meteoric rise in popularity\" and have a \"profound impact on traditional sports.\" It also notes concerns about e-sports potentially overshadowing traditional sports due to their accessibility and global reach. Therefore, option D aligns with the concerns expressed in the paragraph.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the paragraph states that there is increased investment in e-sports, not decreased investment.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the paragraph says that many sporting organizations now recognize e-sports as a legitimate sport, contrary to this option.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the paragraph highlights the accessibility and global reach of e-sports, which suggests that they are not limited in these aspects.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D.\n"
