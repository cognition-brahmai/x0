        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a jar with 4 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. I need to find the probability of not drawing a red marble when I pick one out randomly.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of marbles in the jar. Let's add them up:\n\n4 red + 3 blue + 2 green = 9 marbles in total.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing a red marble would be the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 4/9.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probability of not drawing a red marble. So, that would be the complement of drawing a red marble.\n\nI remember that the probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of it happening. So, P(not red) = 1 - P(red).\n\nSo, P(not red) = 1 - 4/9 = 5/9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can think about it differently. Instead of subtracting the probability of drawing red, I can think about the number of marbles that are not red and divide that by the total number of marbles.\n\nNumber of marbles that are not red is 3 blue + 2 green = 5 marbles.\n\nSo, P(not red) = 5/9.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got before. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of drawing a blue or a green marble, since those are the only other options.\n\nP(blue or green) = P(blue) + P(green) = (3/9) + (2/9) = 5/9.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, the probability of not drawing a red marble is 5/9.\n\nI think that makes sense. The problem seems straightforward, but it's always good to double-check and consider different approaches to confirm the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{9}} \\]"
