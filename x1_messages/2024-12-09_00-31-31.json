        "content": "Let's see. So, there are three people: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each of them makes a statement, and we need to figure out who is a truth-teller and who is a liar based on their statements.\n\nFirst, let's list out what each person says:\n\n- Alice says that Bob is a liar.\n\n- Bob says that Carol is a liar.\n\n- Carol says that both Alice and Bob are truth-tellers.\n\nNow, truth-tellers always tell the truth, and liars always lie. So, every statement made by a truth-teller is true, and every statement made by a liar is false.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider different possibilities and see which one holds true without any contradictions.\n\nLet's start by assuming that Alice is a truth-teller.\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, then her statement that \"Bob is a liar\" must be true. So, Bob is a liar.\n\nNow, if Bob is a liar, then his statement that \"Carol is a liar\" must be false. Because liars lie, so if Bob says Carol is a liar, that must be false, which means Carol is a truth-teller.\n\nNext, Carol says that both Alice and Bob are truth-tellers. But we already determined that Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar. So, Carol's statement is false, which would mean Carol is a liar.\n\nWait a minute, this is a contradiction. We said that if Bob is a liar, then Carol must be a truth-teller, but then Carol's statement is false, which would make her a liar. So, she can't be both a truth-teller and a liar. That doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that Alice is a truth-teller must be wrong.\n\nSo, Alice must be a liar.\n\nIf Alice is a liar, then her statement that \"Bob is a liar\" is false. So, Bob is not a liar; Bob is a truth-teller.\n\nNow, if Bob is a truth-teller, then his statement that \"Carol is a liar\" must be true. So, Carol is a liar.\n\nFinally, Carol says that both Alice and Bob are truth-tellers. But we've determined that Alice is a liar and Bob is a truth-teller. So, Carol's statement is false, which aligns with her being a liar.\n\nLet's summarize:\n\n- Alice: liar\n\n- Bob: truth-teller\n\n- Carol: liar\n\nThis seems consistent without any contradictions.\n\nAlternatively, let's try assuming that Bob is a truth-teller and see if that leads us to the same conclusion.\n\nIf Bob is a truth-teller, then Carol is a liar (as per Bob's statement).\n\nIf Carol is a liar, then her statement that both Alice and Bob are truth-tellers is false. So, at least one of them is a liar. Since we've assumed Bob is a truth-teller, that means Alice must be a liar.\n\nSo, again, we get:\n\n- Alice: liar\n\n- Bob: truth-teller\n\n- Carol: liar\n\nSame as before.\n\nWhat if we assume Carol is a truth-teller?\n\nIf Carol is a truth-teller, then both Alice and Bob are truth-tellers.\n\nBut if Alice is a truth-teller, then Bob is a liar, which contradicts the fact that Bob is a truth-teller. So, Carol can't be a truth-teller.\n\nTherefore, Carol must be a liar.\n\nWhich aligns with our earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, the consistent solution is that Alice and Carol are liars, and Bob is a truth-teller.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice and Carol are liars, and Bob is a truth-teller.}} \\]"
