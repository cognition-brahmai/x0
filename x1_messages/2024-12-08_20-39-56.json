The expression is:\n\n((6 / 2)^2 * (9 - 5)) / 3\n\nFirst, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo, (6 / 2) becomes 3.\n\nNext, 9 - 5 = 4\n\nSo, (9 - 5) becomes 4.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to:\n\n(3^2 * 4) / 3\n\nNext, I'll calculate the exponent:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nSo, the expression now is:\n\n(9 * 4) / 3\n\nNow, multiplication and division are performed from left to right.\n\nFirst, 9 * 4 = 36\n\nSo, the expression is now:\n\n36 / 3\n\nFinally, 36 / 3 = 12\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12."
