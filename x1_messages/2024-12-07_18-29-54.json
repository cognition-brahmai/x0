        "content": "So there are 10 people in a room, and each one has exactly 3 friends in that room. I need to figure out how many friendships there are in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a friendship means here. If person A is friends with person B, then person B is also friends with person A. So, each friendship is between two people.\n\nNow, if each of the 10 people has 3 friends, then at first glance, it might seem like there are 10 times 3 equals 30 friendships. But wait, that counts each friendship twice because each friendship involves two people. So, to get the actual number of unique friendships, I should divide that number by 2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal friendships = (Number of people \u00d7 Number of friends per person) / 2\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal friendships = (10 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15\n\nIs that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use graph theory, where each person is a vertex, and each friendship is an edge connecting two vertices. In this case, we have a graph with 10 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of 3 (since each person has 3 friends).\n\nIn graph theory, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. That's because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nSo, sum of degrees = 2 \u00d7 number of edges\n\nHere, sum of degrees = 10 \u00d7 3 = 30\n\nTherefore, number of edges (friendships) = 30 / 2 = 15\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any restriction or special condition that might affect this result. For example, is it possible for each person to have exactly 3 friends in a group of 10 people?\n\nI think it is possible, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should try to visualize or construct such a setup.\n\nLet's see, if I have 10 people, I can try to arrange them in a way where each has exactly 3 friends.\n\nOne way to think about it is to arrange them in a ring, where each person is friends with the two adjacent people and one more. But that might not suffice to give exactly 3 friends per person without creating overlaps that could cause some people to have more than 3 friends.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a regular graph of degree 3 with 10 vertices. I recall that for a regular graph where each vertex has the same degree, certain conditions must be met.\n\nOne such condition is that the number of vertices times the degree must be even, because the sum of degrees equals twice the number of edges. In this case, 10 \u00d7 3 = 30, which is even, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nMoreover, the degree must be less than the number of vertices, which is satisfied here since 3 < 10.\n\nSo, it seems possible to have such a graph.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation should hold, and there are 15 unique friendships among the 10 people.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? For example, are there any restrictions on who can be friends with whom, like maybe no one can be friends with their own friends' friends, or something like that?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any such restrictions, so I don't think that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the friendships form any particular pattern or structure, but that shouldn't affect the total count.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I pick one person. That person has 3 friends. Each of those 3 friends also has 2 other friends besides the original person.\n\nSo, for each of the 3 friends, there are 2 additional friends.\n\nBut wait, that might lead to overcounting or double-counting if there are overlapping friendships.\n\nThis seems complicated, and I might get lost in the details.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach using graph theory or the handshaking lemma, which gives me the total number of friendships as 15.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the combination formula. The total possible friendships among 10 people are C(10,2) = 45, since any two people can be friends.\n\nBut in this scenario, not everyone is friends with everyone else; each person has exactly 3 friends.\n\nSo, the total number of friendships should be less than 45, which it is, as per my calculation of 15.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each person's 3 friends are a subset of the 9 other people in the room.\n\nSo, for each person, number of friends = 3.\n\nAgain, summing up for all people gives 30, and dividing by 2 gives 15 unique friendships.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways now.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider a smaller example.\n\nSuppose there are 4 people, and each has exactly 2 friends.\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nTotal friendships = (4 \u00d7 2) / 2 = 4\n\nIndeed, in a circle of 4 people, each friend with two others, there are 4 unique friendships.\n\nSimilarly, for 5 people each with 2 friends, total friendships would be (5 \u00d7 2) / 2 = 5.\n\nWait, but 5 is an odd number, and in a circle, it works.\n\nSimilarly, for 10 people with 3 friends each, total friendships are 15.\n\nEverything seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the total number of friendships is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
