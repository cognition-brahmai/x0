He's famous for creating the Middle-earth universe, which includes classic works like \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Now, regarding the last name connection to a circular piece of jewelry, I believe you're thinking of the term \"ring.\" So, Tolkien's last name is Tolkien, but his works extensively feature rings, especially in \"The Lord of the Rings,\" where the One Ring plays a central role. However, I'm a bit confused because \"ring\" is a common term, not directly related to his last name. Maybe there's another layer to this question?"
