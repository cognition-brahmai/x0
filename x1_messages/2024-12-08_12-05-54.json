Here's a suggestion for the lyrics:)\n\n(Verse 1)\nWake up, it's a new day, gotta keep it real\nChanges comin' at me, like a fast-moving reel\nBut I'm not scared, no, I'm ready to flow\nGonna ride this wave, let the rhythm guide me so\n\n(Chorus)\nEmbrace the change, let it be\nGo with the flow, set myself free\nPositive vibes, adapt and thrive\nIn this funky life, I'll stay alive\n\n(Verse 2)\nLife's a dance, gotta move with the beat\nSometimes slow, sometimes fast, can't be defeat\nI'll spin and twist, through the ups and downs\nWith a smile on my face, I'll wear my crown\n\n(Chorus)\nEmbrace the change, let it be\nGo with the flow, set myself free\nPositive vibes, adapt and thrive\nIn this funky life, I'll stay alive\n\n(Bridge)\nHey, when the road bends, don't resist\nJust go with it, let it exist\nEvery turn, a new chance to shine\nIn this journey, I'm divine\n\n(Chorus)\nEmbrace the change, let it be\nGo with the flow, set myself free\nPositive vibes, adapt and thrive\nIn this funky life, I'll stay alive\n\n(Outro)\nSo here's to the changes, big and small\nTo the dancers in the rain, standing tall\nWith a heart full of funk, and a soul so bright\nI'll keep on moving, into the light\n\n(Feel free to adjust the lyrics to better fit your vision or musical style!)"
