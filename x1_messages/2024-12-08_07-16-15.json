        "content": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\u2014\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\u201c\u2019Tis some visitor,\u201d I muttered, \u201ctapping at my chamber door\u2014\nOnly this and nothing more.\u201d\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;\u2014vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow\u2014sorrow for the lost Lenore\u2014\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore\u2014\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me\u2014filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n\u201c\u2019Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\u2014\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;\u2014\nThis it is and nothing more.\u201d\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n\u201cSir,\u201d said I, \u201cor Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\u201d\u2014here I opened wide the door;\u2014\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \u201cLenore!\u201d\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \u201cLenore!\u201d\u2014\nMerely this and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said I, \u201csurely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore\u2014\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;\u2014\n\u2019Tis the wind and nothing more!\u201d\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door\u2014\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door\u2014\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n\u201cThough thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\u201d I said, \u201cart certainly well-woven!\nStiff thou art, implume\n"
