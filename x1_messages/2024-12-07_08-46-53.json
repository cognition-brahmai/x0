        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company charges a flat fee of $25 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost if I rent the car for 3 days and drive it for 150 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the days I rent the car. Since it's $25 per day and I'm renting it for 3 days, I'll multiply 25 by 3.\n\n25 * 3 = 75\n\nSo, the cost for the rental days is $75.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for the miles driven. It's 15 cents per mile, and I drove 150 miles. So, I'll multiply 0.15 (which is 15 cents in dollars) by 150.\n\n0.15 * 150 = 22.5\n\nSo, the cost for the miles driven is $22.50.\n\nNow, I'll add both costs together to get the total cost.\n\n75 + 22.5 = 97.5\n\nTherefore, the total cost for renting the car for 3 days and driving it for 150 miles is $97.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{97.50} \\]"
