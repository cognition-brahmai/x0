        "content": "So the car is going at an average speed of 55 miles per hour for 3 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find out how far it travels in that time. Okay, first things first, I should probably convert the time into hours because the speed is in miles per hour.\n\nSo, 3 hours and 30 minutes. 30 minutes is half an hour, so that would make it 3.5 hours in total. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the formula for distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the values: distance = 55 miles per hour \u00d7 3.5 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that. 55 multiplied by 3.5.\n\nWell, 55 times 3 is 165, and 55 times 0.5 is 27.5. So, 165 plus 27.5 should give me 192.5 miles.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert 3 hours and 30 minutes into minutes. 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 30 minutes, so that's 210 minutes total.\n\nThen, since speed is in miles per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can convert the time into hours by dividing by 60.\n\nSo, 210 minutes divided by 60 is 3.5 hours. Okay, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nSo, again, distance is 55 miles per hour times 3.5 hours, which is 192.5 miles.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of it another way.\n\nLet's see, perhaps I can calculate how far the car travels in 3 hours and then add the distance it travels in the additional 30 minutes.\n\nSo, in 3 hours at 55 miles per hour, the car would travel 3 times 55, which is 165 miles.\n\nThen, in 30 minutes, which is half an hour, the car would travel half of 55 miles, which is 27.5 miles.\n\nAdding those together, 165 plus 27.5, again gives me 192.5 miles.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, but keeping the units consistent.\n\nSpeed is 55 miles per hour, time is 3 hours and 30 minutes, which is 3.5 hours, so again, 55 \u00d7 3.5 = 192.5 miles.\n\nWait, I'm getting the same answer every way I approach this. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there any possibility that the speed isn't constant, or that there are breaks in travel, but the question says \"average speed,\" so I think it's safe to assume that the speed is constant over the period.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"how far does the car travel,\" so I think distance is what's being asked for, not displacement or anything else.\n\nSo, unless there's some trick here that I'm missing, it seems like the answer is simply 192.5 miles.\n\nMaybe I should consider significant figures or something, but since the speed is given to two decimal places and the time is given in hours and minutes, I think 192.5 miles is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I could write it as 192.5 miles, or perhaps in miles and feet, but miles should suffice.\n\nI don't think there's any need to convert to other units unless specified.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the car travels 192.5 miles in 3 hours and 30 minutes at an average speed of 55 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192.5} \\]"
