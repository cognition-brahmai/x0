        "content": "So I have this problem here about a square garden that's 10 meters on each side, and I need to build a fence around it with an extra 1-meter buffer zone on each side. I need to figure out how long the fence should be in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the buffer zone means. Since it's an additional 1 meter on each side, that means that the fence won't just be around the original garden, but it will extend 1 meter outward beyond each side of the garden.\n\nLet me visualize this. I have a square garden, each side is 10 meters. Now, for the fence, I need to add 1 meter to each side. But since it's a square, and the buffer is on all sides, I need to consider that the fence will be built around the entire perimeter, extending 1 meter out from each side of the garden.\n\nWait a minute, if I add 1 meter to each side, does that mean the total side length of the area to be fenced is 10 meters plus 1 meter on one side and another 1 meter on the opposite side? So, actually, for each side of the square, the fence will be 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 meters long.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I have a square garden that's 10 meters per side, and I add a 1-meter buffer on each side, then effectively, the fenced area will be larger than the original garden.\n\nTo be precise, the original garden is 10 meters by 10 meters. Adding 1 meter to each side means that on every side of the square, the fence is 1 meter away from the garden's edge.\n\nSo, for one side, the fence is 10 meters (garden) + 1 meter (buffer on one side) + 1 meter (buffer on the other side) = 12 meters.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's think about it differently. If I have a square and I'm adding a uniform buffer around it, it's like expanding the square by 1 meter in all directions.\n\nSo, the new side length should be the original side length plus twice the buffer width, because the buffer adds to both sides of each edge.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, side length of the fenced area = 10 meters + 2*(1 meter) = 12 meters.\n\nNow, since it's a square, all four sides are equal. So, the total length of the fence would be 4 times the side length.\n\nTherefore, total fence length = 4 * 12 meters = 48 meters.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other aspect to consider, like corners or something? In a square, the corners are right angles, so adding a buffer uniformly should still result in a square.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Alternatively, I could think about the area to be fenced as the original garden plus the buffer zone around it.\n\nLet me confirm with another approach. If I consider the buffer as adding 1 meter out from each side, then effectively, the fenced area is a larger square with each side being 10 + 2*1 = 12 meters, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, perimeter would be 4 * 12 = 48 meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the fence surrounding the garden plus the buffer zone. The buffer is 1 meter wide all around, so the fence should be at a distance of 1 meter from the garden's edge everywhere.\n\nTherefore, the fence's position is consistently 1 meter outside the garden's boundary, forming another square.\n\nHence, the side of the fenced area is indeed 12 meters, and the total fence length is 48 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the \"additional 1-meter buffer zone on each side\" could be interpreted differently. Perhaps it means adding 1 meter to each side without doubling it.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because \"each side\" refers to each of the four sides of the square. If I add 1 meter to each side, I need to consider that the buffer is added to both sides of each edge.\n\nWait, no, actually, \"each side\" means both sides of each edge. So, for each edge, the buffer is added on both ends, hence it's 1 meter on one side and 1 meter on the other side, totaling 2 meters added to each side's length.\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let's think about it differently.\n\nImagine the garden is a square with side length 10 meters. If I add a 1-meter buffer on each side, it's like expanding the garden by 1 meter in all directions.\n\nSo, visually, if I draw the original square and then draw a larger square around it, where each side is 1 meter away from the corresponding side of the original square.\n\nIn this case, the new square's sides will be parallel to the original square's sides, and the distance between them is 1 meter.\n\nTherefore, the side length of the new square is 10 meters + 2 meters (1 meter on each side), which is 12 meters.\n\nHence, the perimeter is 4 * 12 = 48 meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the area between the garden and the fence. The area to be fenced is the area of the larger square minus the area of the garden.\n\nBut actually, the problem is just asking for the length of the fence, which is the perimeter of the larger square.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The fence should be 48 meters long.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
