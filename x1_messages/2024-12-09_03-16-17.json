        "content": "So there's this box with balls, right? 10 are red and 15 are blue. I need to find out the chance of picking a red one if I grab one ball at random. Hmm, probability stuff.\n\nFirst, I should remember what probability is. It's like measuring how likely something is to happen. In this case, picking a red ball. The formula for probability is usually the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and there are 10 red balls. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls in the box, which is 10 red plus 15 blue, so 25 balls in total.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 10 (red balls) divided by 25 (total balls). That simplifies to 2/5, I think. Let me check that division: 10 divided by 25 is 0.4, and 0.4 is the same as 2/5.\n\nBut probabilities are often expressed as fractions, decimals, or percentages. So, 2/5 is 0.4, which is 40%. So, there's a 40% chance of picking a red ball.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe considering the blue balls or something. But no, the question is specifically about picking a red ball, so the blue balls are just part of the total.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I pick a ball, and it's either red or blue. The probability of picking red is 10/25, and picking blue would be 15/25, which is 3/5 or 0.6, and that adds up to 1, which makes sense because one of them has to happen.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, I'm confident that the probability is 10/25, which simplifies to 2/5 or 0.4, which is 40%.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the balls are being picked with replacement or without, but since it's just one pick, that doesn't matter here.\n\nAlso, assuming that each ball is equally likely to be picked, which is probably the case since it's a random pick.\n\nSo, my final answer is 2/5 or 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]\n"
