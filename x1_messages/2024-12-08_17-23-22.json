        "content": "So the company currently spends $15,000 on employee salaries each month. They're planning to give all employees a 10% raise. I need to find out what their new monthly salary expense will be after this raise.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 10% raise means. A 10% raise means that each employee's salary is increased by 10% of their current salary. So, if an employee earns $1000, a 10% raise would be $100, making their new salary $1100.\n\nBut here, I don't have the individual salaries; I just have the total monthly salary expense, which is $15,000. So, I need to find a way to calculate the total increase based on this total amount.\n\nSince the raise is 10% for all employees, the total increase in salary expenses should be 10% of the current total salary expense.\n\nLet me calculate 10% of $15,000.\n\n10% of $15,000 is (10/100) * 15,000 = 0.1 * 15,000 = $1,500.\n\nSo, the total increase in salary expenses is $1,500.\n\nNow, to find the new monthly salary expense, I need to add this increase to the current salary expense.\n\nNew monthly salary expense = current salary expense + total increase\n\n= $15,000 + $1,500\n\n= $16,500.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this?\n\nI could think of the new salary as 100% of the current salary plus the 10% raise, which totals 110% of the current salary.\n\nSo, another way to calculate the new monthly salary expense is to find 110% of the current $15,000.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n110% of $15,000 is (110/100) * 15,000 = 1.1 * 15,000 = $16,500.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the new monthly salary expense will be $16,500.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I should account for.\n\nIs there any possibility that the raise might not be uniform across all employees, or that some employees might not get the raise? The problem says \"all employees\" get a 10% raise, so I think it's safe to assume that everyone gets the same percentage increase.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the company doesn't have any other salary-related expenses besides what's already included in the $15,000. But since the problem specifies that $15,000 is spent on employee salaries each month, and the raise is for all employees, I think $16,500 is the correct new monthly expense.\n\nLet me consider another angle: if the company has a certain number of employees, say 'n', and average salary 'a', such that n * a = $15,000.\n\nAfter a 10% raise, each employee's salary becomes a + 0.1a = 1.1a.\n\nSo, the new total salary expense would be n * 1.1a = 1.1 * (n * a) = 1.1 * 15,000 = $16,500.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem, and in each case, the new monthly salary expense comes out to be $16,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16500} \\]"
