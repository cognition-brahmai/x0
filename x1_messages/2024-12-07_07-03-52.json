Each plan will have an associated evidence value, which is the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be the user question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool is useful in finding relevant sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nURLParser[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and produces a list of URLs.\nWebReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nQuerier[input]: Question answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an #E[n] variable, e.g. What color is the dog, given #E1?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g. Querier[What is the capital of France, given #E3?]\n\nBe sure to only include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [#E[n] containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the current president of Microsoft and what major projects have they overseen?"
