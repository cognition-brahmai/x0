It plays a crucial role in the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Iron is also involved in various other bodily functions, including energy metabolism and immune system support. A deficiency in iron can lead to anemia, which causes fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, among other symptoms. Therefore, maintaining adequate iron levels is important for overall well-being."
