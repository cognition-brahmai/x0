        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 classes, each with 25 students, and each student has 5 textbooks. Each textbook has 200 pages. I need to find out the total number of pages in all the textbooks combined.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many students there are in total. Since there are 4 classes with 25 students each, the total number of students is 4 times 25, which is 100 students.\n\nNext, each student has 5 textbooks. So, the total number of textbooks is 100 students times 5 textbooks per student, which is 500 textbooks.\n\nNow, each textbook has 200 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages is 500 textbooks times 200 pages per textbook.\n\nLet me calculate that: 500 times 200.\n\n500 times 200 is 100,000.\n\nSo, there are a total of 100,000 pages in all the textbooks combined.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a easier way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, find the number of students: 4 classes times 25 students per class is indeed 100 students.\n\nThen, each student has 5 textbooks, so total textbooks are 100 times 5, which is 500 textbooks.\n\nEach textbook has 200 pages, so total pages are 500 times 200, which is 100,000 pages.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\nNumber of classes times students per class times textbooks per student times pages per textbook.\n\nSo, 4 times 25 times 5 times 200.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 4 times 25 is 100.\n\nThen, 100 times 5 is 500.\n\nFinally, 500 times 200 is 100,000.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages is 100,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100000} \\]"
