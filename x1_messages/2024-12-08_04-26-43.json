        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a group of people, and here's what we know:\n\n- 75% have brown eyes.\n\n- 60% have long hair.\n\n- 45% have both brown eyes and long hair.\n\nThe question is asking for the percentage of people who have both brown eyes and long hair, but specifically among those who have brown eyes. In other words, what percentage of the brown-eyed people also have long hair.\n\nThis sounds like a problem involving conditional probability. The formula for conditional probability is:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the probability of event A happening given that B has happened.\n\n- \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) is the probability of both A and B happening.\n\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of event B happening.\n\nIn this context:\n\n- Let A be the event of having long hair.\n\n- Let B be the event of having brown eyes.\n\nSo, we're looking for \\( P(A|B) \\), which is the probability of having long hair given that someone has brown eyes.\n\nWe know:\n\n- \\( P(B) = 75\\% \\) (probability of having brown eyes).\n\n- \\( P(A \\cap B) = 45\\% \\) (probability of having both brown eyes and long hair).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{45\\%}{75\\%} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{45}{75} = 0.6 \\]\n\nTo express this as a percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.6 \\times 100\\% = 60\\% \\]\n\nSo, 60% of those with brown eyes also have long hair.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nWe know that 75% have brown eyes, and 60% have long hair. The overlap is 45%, which is less than both groups, which makes sense.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of brown-eyed people who also have long hair, we're essentially asking what portion of the brown-eyed group also has long hair.\n\nSo, out of the 75% who have brown eyes, 45% have both brown eyes and long hair.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 45% divided by 75%, which indeed is 60%.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider actual numbers. Suppose there are 100 people in the group.\n\n- 75 people have brown eyes.\n\n- 60 people have long hair.\n\n- 45 people have both brown eyes and long hair.\n\nSo, out of the 75 brown-eyed people, 45 also have long hair.\n\nWhat percentage is that?\n\n\\[ \\frac{45}{75} \\times 100\\% = 60\\% \\]\n\nSame result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if this fits with the overall percentages.\n\nTotal percentage of people with either brown eyes or long hair or both can be found using the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = 60\\% + 75\\% - 45\\% = 90\\% \\]\n\nSo, 90% of the people have either long hair, brown eyes, or both.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret the question?\n\nWell, the question is pretty straightforward. It's asking for the percentage of brown-eyed people who also have long hair.\n\nWe've calculated that it's 60%.\n\nAlternatively, one might be tempted to think about the percentage of people with long hair who also have brown eyes, but that's not what's being asked.\n\nThat would be \\( P(B|A) \\), which is different.\n\n\\[ P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} = \\frac{45\\%}{60\\%} = 75\\% \\]\n\nSo, 75% of those with long hair also have brown eyes, but that's not what the question is asking.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the percentage of those with brown eyes who also have long hair, which is 60%.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
