We'll create a class called `BankAccount` that will have methods for depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the balance.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to building this program:\n\n1. **Define the BankAccount Class:**\n   - This class will have a private instance variable to store the balance.\n   - It will have constructors to initialize the account with a zero balance or with a specified initial balance.\n   - Methods for depositing and withdrawing money will modify the balance.\n   - A method to get the current balance will return the balance value.\n\n2. **Implementing the Methods:**\n   - `deposit(double amount)`: Adds the specified amount to the balance.\n   - `withdraw(double amount)`: Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n   - `getBalance()`: Returns the current balance.\n\n3. **Creating a Test Class:**\n   - This class will create instances of `BankAccount` and test the methods to ensure they work correctly.\n\nLet's start by writing the `BankAccount` class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple bank account simulation in Java, we'll define a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. We'll also create a test class to demonstrate the functionality.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Define the BankAccount Class:**\n   - Private instance variable `balance` to store the account balance.\n   - Constructors to initialize the account with zero balance or a specified initial balance.\n   - `deposit(double amount)`: Adds the amount to the balance.\n   - `withdraw(double amount)`: Subtracts the amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n   - `getBalance()`: Returns the current balance.\n\n2. **Create a Test Class:**\n   - Create instances of `BankAccount`.\n   - Test depositing and withdrawing money.\n   - Check the balance to ensure operations are correct.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\n// BankAccount.java\npublic class BankAccount {\n    private double balance;\n\n    // Constructor with zero balance\n    public BankAccount() {\n        this.balance = 0.0;\n    }\n\n    // Constructor with initial balance\n    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {\n        this.balance = initialBalance;\n    }\n\n    // Method to deposit money\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n            System.out.println(\"Deposited: \" + amount);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid deposit amount.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to withdraw money\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            if (balance >= amount) {\n                balance -= amount;\n                System.out.println(\"Withdrew: \" + amount);\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n            }\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid withdrawal amount.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to get the current balance\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n}\n\n// BankAccountTest.java\npublic class BankAccountTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a bank account with initial balance\n        BankAccount account1 = new BankAccount(100.0);\n\n        // Deposit and withdraw money\n        account1.deposit(50.0);\n        account1.withdraw(30.0);\n        account1.withdraw(150.0); // This should fail due to insufficient funds\n\n        // Check balance\n        System.out.println(\"Current balance: \" + account1.getBalance());\n\n        // Create another bank account with zero balance\n        BankAccount account2 = new BankAccount();\n\n        // Deposit and withdraw money\n        account2.deposit(100.0);\n        account2.withdraw(50.0);\n        account2.withdraw(-20.0); // This should be invalid\n\n        // Check balance\n        System.out.println(\"Current balance: \" + account2.getBalance());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **BankAccount Class:**\n   - `balance`: Stores the account's balance.\n   - Constructors: Initialize the balance to zero or to a specified amount.\n   - `deposit(double amount)`: Adds the amount to the balance if positive.\n   - `withdraw(double amount)`: Subtracts the amount from the balance if sufficient funds and amount is positive.\n   - `getBalance()`: Returns the current balance.\n\n2. **BankAccountTest Class:**\n   - Creates `BankAccount` instances.\n   - Performs deposits and withdrawals.\n   - Checks and prints the balance after operations to verify correctness.\n\nThis simple simulation demonstrates basic bank account operations and error handling for invalid amounts and insufficient funds."
