        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company that sells widgets. They sell each widget for $25, and it costs them $10 to produce each one. On top of that, they have fixed costs of $5,000 per month. The question is, how many widgets do they need to sell each month to break even?\n\nAlright, breaking even means that their total revenue equals their total costs. Total costs include both the fixed costs and the variable costs. Variable costs are the costs that change with the level of production, like the cost to produce each widget, while fixed costs remain the same regardless of how many widgets are produced.\n\nSo, first, let's define the variables:\n\n- Selling price per widget: $25\n\n- Variable cost per widget: $10\n\n- Fixed costs per month: $5,000\n\nLet\u2019s let \\( x \\) be the number of widgets they need to sell to break even.\n\nNow, the total revenue (TR) from selling \\( x \\) widgets would be:\n\n\\[ TR = 25x \\]\n\nThe total cost (TC) of producing \\( x \\) widgets would be the fixed costs plus the variable costs:\n\n\\[ TC = 5,000 + 10x \\]\n\nAt the break-even point, total revenue equals total cost:\n\n\\[ 25x = 5,000 + 10x \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\). Let\u2019s subtract \\( 10x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 25x - 10x = 5,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 15x = 5,000 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 15:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{5,000}{15} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 333.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nSince they can't sell a fraction of a widget, they need to sell at least 334 widgets to cover their costs.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check if that's correct. If they sell 333 widgets:\n\nRevenue: 333 * 25 = $8,325\n\nVariable costs: 333 * 10 = $3,330\n\nTotal costs: 3,330 + 5,000 = $8,330\n\nSo, revenue is $8,325 and costs are $8,330, which means they're still $5 short.\n\nIf they sell 334 widgets:\n\nRevenue: 334 * 25 = $8,350\n\nVariable costs: 334 * 10 = $3,340\n\nTotal costs: 3,340 + 5,000 = $8,340\n\nNow, revenue is $8,350 and costs are $8,340, so they've covered their costs and have $10 left over.\n\nTherefore, they need to sell 334 widgets to break even.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for break-even point:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{\\text{fixed costs}}{\\text{selling price per unit} - \\text{variable cost per unit}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{5,000}{25 - 10} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{5,000}{15} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 333.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nAgain, since they can't sell a fraction of a widget, they need to sell 334 widgets.\n\nI think this makes sense. Break-even analysis is all about finding the point where revenue equals costs, and it's straightforward once you set up the equations correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{334} \\]"
