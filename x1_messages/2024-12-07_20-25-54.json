        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There are 12 black socks and 16 white socks mixed up in a drawer, and the room is completely dark. I need to figure out the minimum number of socks I must pull out to ensure that I have at least one matching pair. And I can't see anything because it's dark, so I have to rely on logic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a matching pair means. A matching pair would be two socks of the same color, either both black or both white.\n\nNow, since it's dark, I can't see the colors, so I have to consider the worst-case scenario to ensure that I have a matching pair.\n\nLet's think about it step by step.\n\nSuppose I pull out one sock. It could be either black or white, but I don't know which because it's dark.\n\nThen, I pull out a second sock. Now, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. The second sock is the same color as the first one.\n\n2. The second sock is a different color from the first one.\n\nIf the second sock matches the first one in color, then I have a matching pair.\n\nBut if the second sock is a different color, then I have one black and one white sock.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the first two socks I pull out are of different colors.\n\nSo, to ensure that I have at least one matching pair, I need to pull out a third sock.\n\nNow, with three socks, I have the following possibilities:\n\n- Two black and one white.\n\n- Two white and one black.\n\nIn either case, I have at least one matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks I must pull out to ensure at least one matching pair is three.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to think about this?\n\nI recall something called the Pigeonhole Principle in mathematics. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, the \"containers\" are the sock colors: black and white.\n\nSo, if I have two colors (containers), to ensure that at least one container has more than one sock, I need to have at least three socks.\n\nBecause with two socks, it's possible to have one in each color, but with three socks, at least one color must have two socks.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, applying the Pigeonhole Principle here, with two colors, I need to pull out three socks to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose I pull out two socks: one black and one white.\n\nThen, the next sock I pull out will either be black or white, but in either case, it will match one of the previous socks.\n\nSo, yes, three socks are sufficient.\n\nIs there any way to do it with fewer than three socks?\n\nWell, if I pull out only two socks, it's possible to get one black and one white, which doesn't give me a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, two socks are not sufficient to ensure a matching pair.\n\nHence, three socks are indeed the minimum number required to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose there are 12 black socks and 16 white socks, totaling 28 socks.\n\nBut the actual numbers might not matter in this case, because the worst-case scenario is what determines the minimum number.\n\nEven if there were a million white socks and only one black sock, the principle would still hold.\n\nI'd still need to pull out three socks to ensure a matching pair.\n\nBecause in the worst case, the first two socks are of different colors, and the third sock will match one of them.\n\nSo, the conclusion remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is three socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
