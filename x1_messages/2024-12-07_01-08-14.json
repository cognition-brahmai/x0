        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about marbles in a bag. So, there are red and blue marbles only, and the total number of marbles is 60. The probability of picking a red marble is twice the probability of picking a blue marble. I need to find out how many red marbles are in the bag.\n\nFirst, I should probably define some variables to represent the number of red and blue marbles. Let's say R is the number of red marbles and B is the number of blue marbles. I know that the total number of marbles is 60, so R + B = 60.\n\nNow, probability of picking a red marble is R divided by the total number of marbles, which is 60. So, P(red) = R/60. Similarly, the probability of picking a blue marble is B/60.\n\nAccording to the problem, the probability of picking a red marble is twice the probability of picking a blue marble. So, P(red) = 2 * P(blue).\n\nSubstituting the expressions I have for P(red) and P(blue), that would be R/60 = 2*(B/60).\n\nSimplifying that, R/60 = (2B)/60, which simplifies further to R = 2B.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. R + B = 60\n\n2. R = 2B\n\nI can substitute the second equation into the first one. So, 2B + B = 60, which is 3B = 60. Therefore, B = 20.\n\nNow, since R = 2B, R = 2*20 = 40.\n\nSo, there are 40 red marbles in the bag.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If there are 40 red marbles and 20 blue marbles, the total is 60, which matches. The probability of picking a red marble is 40/60 = 2/3, and the probability of picking a blue marble is 20/60 = 1/3. Is 2/3 twice as much as 1/3? Yes, because 2*(1/3) = 2/3.\n\nSo, my answer seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
