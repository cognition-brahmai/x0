The park has allocated a budget of $500,000 for this project, which includes habitat restoration, monitoring equipment, and personnel costs. Habitat restoration costs $10,000 per acre, and the park plans to restore 20 acres of land. Monitoring equipment costs $50,000 in total, and personnel costs are $30,000 per staff member per year. Calculate how many staff members the park can hire within their budget, considering they need to maintain the program for at least three years."

        "content": "Let's break down the budget for this bird reintroduction project step by step. The total budget is $500,000, and it needs to cover three main areas: habitat restoration, monitoring equipment, and personnel costs. The project needs to be sustained for at least three years.\n\nFirst, habitat restoration costs $10,000 per acre, and the park plans to restore 20 acres. So, the cost for habitat restoration would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Habitat restoration cost} = 20 \\, \\text{acres} \\times \\$10,000/\\text{acre} = \\$200,000 \\]\n\nNext, the monitoring equipment costs a flat rate of $50,000 in total. This is a one-time cost, assuming it's for the entire duration of the project.\n\nNow, personnel costs are $30,000 per staff member per year. Since the program needs to be maintained for at least three years, the cost per staff member over three years would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Personnel cost per staff member for 3 years} = 3 \\times \\$30,000 = \\$90,000 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total budget allocated to habitat restoration and monitoring equipment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total for habitat and monitoring} = \\$200,000 + \\$50,000 = \\$250,000 \\]\n\nSubtracting this from the total budget gives us the amount available for personnel costs:\n\n\\[ \\text{Budget for personnel} = \\$500,000 - \\$250,000 = \\$250,000 \\]\n\nNow, to find out how many staff members can be hired with \\$250,000 over three years, we divide the personnel budget by the cost per staff member for three years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of staff members} = \\frac{\\$250,000}{\\$90,000/\\text{staff member}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of staff members} = 2.777... \\]\n\nSince you can't hire a fraction of a staff member, the park can hire 2 full-time staff members with the remaining budget.\n\nLet's calculate the remaining budget after hiring 2 staff members:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for 2 staff members} = 2 \\times \\$90,000 = \\$180,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining budget} = \\$250,000 - \\$180,000 = \\$70,000 \\]\n\nThis remaining \\$70,000 could potentially be used to hire a third staff member on a partial basis or for other related expenses. However, since the personnel cost for one staff member over three years is \\$90,000, which is more than the remaining \\$70,000, the park cannot afford a third full-time staff member.\n\nAlternatively, the park could consider hiring a third staff member for a shorter period or at a reduced salary, but that would require further negotiation and planning.\n\nIn conclusion, with a budget of \\$500,000, after allocating for habitat restoration and monitoring equipment, the park can hire 2 full-time staff members to maintain the bird reintroduction program for three years, with \\$70,000 remaining that may be used for other expenses or partial hiring of an additional staff member.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
