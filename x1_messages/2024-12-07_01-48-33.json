        "content": "You're referring to the era of art that was prominent in the Western Roman Empire from approximately 400 to 1400 A.D. This period is known as the Medieval period or the Middle Ages. During this time, fresco painting was indeed a significant art form, particularly in the decoration of churches and other religious buildings.\n\nFresco is a technique where pigments are applied to wet plaster, allowing the colors to seep into the plaster and become part of the wall itself. This method was widely used in the medieval period for creating durable and long-lasting artwork on the walls and ceilings of buildings.\n\nSome notable examples of medieval frescoes can be found in the Romanesque and Gothic styles of architecture, which feature arches and other architectural elements that you mentioned. These frescoes often depicted religious scenes and stories, serving an educational purpose for a largely illiterate population.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the era you're referring to is the Medieval period, and fresco was indeed a major art form during that time in the Western Roman Empire."
