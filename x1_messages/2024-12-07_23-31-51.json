        "content": "I'd be happy to help you develop a FastAPI application with an endpoint that calculates the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers provided in a JSON payload. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, make sure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed in your environment. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi uvicorn\n```\n\nNext, we'll create a Python file for our application, let's name it `main.py`.\n\nIn this file, we'll import the necessary modules and define our endpoint.\n\nHere's a basic structure of what your `main.py` might look like:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\nfrom typing import List\nfrom statistics import mean, median, mode\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post(\"/calculate/\")\nasync def calculate_statistics(numbers: List[float]):\n    if not numbers:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\"List of numbers is empty\")\n    \n    try:\n        avg = mean(numbers)\n        med = median(numbers)\n        mod = mode(numbers)\n        return {\"mean\": avg, \"median\": med, \"mode\": mod}\n    except StatisticsError as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Imports:**\n   - `FastAPI` and `HTTPException` from `fastapi`.\n   - `List` from `typing` for type hinting.\n   - `mean`, `median`, and `mode` from the `statistics` module.\n\n2. **App Instance:**\n   - Create an instance of `FastAPI`.\n\n3. **Endpoint Definition:**\n   - Define a POST endpoint at `/calculate/` that accepts a JSON payload containing a list of floats.\n   - Check if the list is empty and raise a 400 Bad Request error if it is.\n   - Calculate the mean, median, and mode using the `statistics` module.\n   - Return a JSON response with the calculated statistics.\n   - Handle any exceptions that might occur during the calculation, such as `StatisticsError` when the mode is undefined.\n\nTo run this application, you can use Uvicorn:\n\n```bash\nuvicorn main:app --reload\n```\n\nThis will start the server, and you can test the endpoint using tools like Postman or curl.\n\nFor example, using curl:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/calculate/\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"[1,2,3,4,5]\"\n```\n\nThis should return:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mean\": 3.0,\n  \"median\": 3.0,\n  \"mode\": 1\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `mode` function from `statistics` module returns the smallest number in case of a multi-modal distribution. If you need different behavior, you might have to implement a custom mode function.\n\nAlso, be aware that the `mode` function can raise a `StatisticsError` if the list is empty or if there is no mode. We're catching this exception and returning a 500 Internal Server Error, but you might want to handle it differently based on your requirements.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for your FastAPI application. If you have any specific requirements or need further customization, feel free to ask!"
