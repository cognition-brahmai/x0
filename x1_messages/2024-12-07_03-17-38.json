        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If you invest $5,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded annually, how much will your investment be worth after 6 years? Alright, let's break this down. I know that when interest is compounded annually, the formula to calculate the future value of an investment is:\n\n\\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so in this case, $5,000.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal. Since the rate is 4%, that would be 0.04.\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years the money is invested for, which is 6 years here.\n\nSo, plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 5000(1 + 0.04)^6 \\]\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \\( 1 + 0.04 \\), which is \\( 1.04 \\). Then, I need to raise \\( 1.04 \\) to the power of 6.\n\nLet me calculate \\( 1.04^6 \\). I can do this step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( 1.04^2 = 1.04 \\times 1.04 = 1.0816 \\).\n\nNext, \\( 1.04^3 = 1.0816 \\times 1.04 = 1.124864 \\).\n\nThen, \\( 1.04^4 = 1.124864 \\times 1.04 = 1.16985856 \\).\n\nAfter that, \\( 1.04^5 = 1.16985856 \\times 1.04 = 1.2166507824 \\).\n\nFinally, \\( 1.04^6 = 1.2166507824 \\times 1.04 = 1.265319808896 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 1.04^6 \\) is approximately 1.26532.\n\nNow, multiply this by the principal amount:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.26532 = 6326.60 \\]\n\nTherefore, after 6 years, the investment will be worth approximately $6,326.60.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n5000 times 1.26532:\n\nFirst, 5000 times 1 is 5000.\n\n5000 times 0.2 is 1000.\n\n5000 times 0.06 is 300.\n\n5000 times 0.005 is 25.\n\n5000 times 0.0003 is 1.5.\n\n5000 times 0.00002 is 0.1.\n\nAdding all these up: 5000 + 1000 = 6000; 6000 + 300 = 6300; 6300 + 25 = 6325; 6325 + 1.5 = 6326.5; 6326.5 + 0.1 = 6326.60.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a financial calculator or a spreadsheet to confirm this calculation.\n\nIf I use a financial calculator, I would input:\n\n- Present Value (PV) = -5000 (negative because it's an outflow).\n\n- Interest Rate (I/Y) = 4.\n\n- Number of Periods (N) = 6.\n\n- Compute Future Value (FV).\n\nThe result should be approximately $6,326.60.\n\nSimilarly, in a spreadsheet, I could use the FV function:\n\n\\[ =FV(0.04, 6, 0, -5000) \\]\n\nWhich should also give me $6,326.60.\n\nSo, it seems like my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, after 6 years, the investment will be worth $6,326.60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6326.60} \\]"
