        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem about apples and oranges, and I need to find out the price of one apple. Okay, let's read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.\n\n\"A store sells apples and oranges. The price of an apple is twice the price of an orange. If you buy 3 apples and 5 oranges, the total cost is $11. What is the price of one apple?\"\n\nAlright, so first, it says that the price of an apple is twice the price of an orange. That means if an orange costs x dollars, then an apple costs 2x dollars. Got it.\n\nNext, it says that if you buy 3 apples and 5 oranges, the total cost is $11. So, I need to somehow use this information to find out the price of one apple.\n\nMaybe I can set up some equations here. Let's assign variables to the prices.\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- Let o be the price of one orange.\n\n- Then, the price of one apple is 2o, since it's twice the price of an orange.\n\nNow, if I buy 3 apples and 5 oranges, the total cost is $11. So, in terms of the variables:\n\n3 apples would cost 3 times the price of one apple, which is 3*(2o) = 6o.\n\n5 oranges would cost 5 times the price of one orange, which is 5*o = 5o.\n\nSo, the total cost is 6o + 5o = 11o.\n\nAnd this total is given as $11.\n\nSo, 11o = 11.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. To find o, I can divide both sides by 11:\n\no = 11 / 11 = 1.\n\nSo, the price of one orange is $1.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the price of one apple, not an orange. Remember, apple is twice the price of an orange, so apple is 2*1 = $2.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nIf orange is $1, apple is $2.\n\nBuy 3 apples: 3*2 = $6.\n\nBuy 5 oranges: 5*1 = $5.\n\nTotal: 6 + 5 = $11, which matches the given total.\n\nLooks good.\n\nSo, the price of one apple is $2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
