        "content": "In the cathedral of the sky, where clouds are priests,\nI saw a rainbow, a bridge between tears and skies.\nNot the rainbow children paint with hands of clay,\nBut one born of storms, wild and free, in a blaze of array.\n\nIt was a serpent of light, coiled and uncoiled,\nIts scales were colors never beguiled.\nRed like the lips of lovers in the first kiss,\nOrange as the setting sun, a sigh of bliss.\n\nYellow, the laughter of children on a bright day,\nGreen, the promise of fields that stretch far away.\nBlue, the deep call of the ocean's embrace,\nIndigo, the mystery hidden in time's grace.\n\nViolet, the secret dreams that only night can frame,\nEach hue a poem, each color a name.\nA rainbow, they say, is light's own prism,\nBut this was more, it was life's own prism.\n\nIt arched over the world, a transient throne,\nWhere angels might perch, or gods all alone.\nI thought of you, beneath this spectrum's span,\nYour eyes reflecting colors of your own man.\n\nFor in your soul, I see a rainbow too,\nA blend of emotions, fierce and true.\nYour joys are red, your sorrows deep blue,\nYour hopes are yellow, your dreams indigo.\n\nSo here's to rainbows, both above and within,\nTo the colors that bind us, and make us kin.\nMay they guide our steps through life's stormy weather,\nAnd remind us that beauty is always with tether.\n\nThis rainbow, a fleeting vision, now faded to memory,\nYet in my heart, its colors forever free.\nJust as you, dear friend, remain a spectrum of delight,\nIn the ever-changing sky of my life, a constant sight.\n"
