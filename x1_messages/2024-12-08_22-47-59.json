        "content": "So, you've got a rectangular room that's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, and you want to know how many feet you've walked if you go round the perimeter once. Perimeter, huh? That sounds like something to do with the edges of the room.\n\nI remember that the perimeter of a shape is the total length around it. So, for a rectangle, it should be the sum of all its sides. A rectangle has two lengths and two widths, right? So, if the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, then the perimeter should be 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 20 + 2 \u00d7 15\n\nNow, 2 times 20 is 40, and 2 times 15 is 30. So, adding those together:\n\nPerimeter = 40 + 30 = 70 feet\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me visualize it. If I start at one corner and walk along the length to the next corner, that's 20 feet. Then, I turn and walk along the width, which is 15 feet. Then, another 20 feet along the next length, and finally 15 feet back to the starting point. So, 20 + 15 + 20 + 15 equals 70 feet. Yep, that matches what I calculated.\n\nIs there another way to think about it? Maybe using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. I think the general formula is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. Let's try that:\n\nP = 2(20 + 15) = 2(35) = 70 feet\n\nOkay, same answer. Good, that reinforces that 70 feet is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the perimeter. Is the room on a slope or something? No, it's a regular rectangular room, so no need to account for any unusual features.\n\nAlso, the question specifies that it's a rectangular room, so I can assume all angles are right angles, and the opposite sides are equal, which is consistent with the initial approach.\n\nOne more thing: feet are the units here, and there's no need to convert to any other unit since the question asks for the answer in feet.\n\nSo, to conclude, if you walk around the perimeter of the room once, you've walked 70 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
