        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car rental company. They have 150 cars in total, and the rental rates are different depending on whether it's a weekday or a weekend. During weekdays, they rent out cars at an average rate of 65%, and on weekends, it's 90%. The question is asking how many cars can be expected to be rented on a typical week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a typical week looks like in terms of days. Usually, a week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. So, I should probably calculate the number of cars rented during the weekdays and during the weekends separately, and then add them up to get the total for the week.\n\nLet's start with the weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, and the rental rate is 65%. So, the number of cars rented each weekday would be 65% of 150 cars. Let me calculate that:\n\n65% of 150 is 0.65 times 150, which is:\n\n0.65 * 150 = 97.5\n\nSo, approximately 97.5 cars are rented each weekday. But since we can't have half a car rented, maybe I should consider it as 97 or 98 cars, but since it's an average, I'll keep it as 97.5 for now.\n\nNow, for the entire weekdays, which are 5 days, the total number of cars rented would be:\n\n97.5 cars/day * 5 days = 487.5 cars\n\nAgain, we end up with a half car, but since we're dealing with averages, I'll keep it as 487.5.\n\nNext, let's look at the weekends. There are 2 weekend days, and the rental rate is 90%. So, the number of cars rented each weekend day would be 90% of 150 cars.\n\n90% of 150 is 0.9 times 150, which is:\n\n0.9 * 150 = 135 cars\n\nSo, each weekend day, 135 cars are rented.\n\nFor the entire weekend, which is 2 days, the total number of cars rented would be:\n\n135 cars/day * 2 days = 270 cars\n\nNow, to find the total number of cars rented in a typical week, I need to add the weekday rentals and the weekend rentals together:\n\n487.5 cars (weekdays) + 270 cars (weekends) = 757.5 cars\n\nSo, approximately 757.5 cars can be expected to be rented on a typical week.\n\nBut wait a minute, the company only has 150 cars. How can the total rentals exceed the number of cars available? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about the average number of cars rented per day and then multiply by the number of days in a week.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nFirst, find the average rental rate per day over the entire week.\n\nThere are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.\n\nThe rental rate is 65% on weekdays and 90% on weekends.\n\nSo, the weighted average rental rate for the week would be:\n\n(5 days * 65% + 2 days * 90%) / 7 days\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(5 * 65 + 2 * 90) / 7 = (325 + 180) / 7 = 505 / 7 \u2248 72.14%\n\nSo, the average rental rate per day over the week is approximately 72.14%.\n\nNow, to find the total number of cars rented in a week, I can multiply the average daily rental rate by the number of days in a week and by the total number of cars.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct because the rental rate is already accounting for the number of cars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total rentals based on the daily rental rates multiplied by the number of days.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf the company has 150 cars and rents them at 65% rate on weekdays, that means approximately 97.5 cars are rented each weekday.\n\nSimilarly, on weekends, at 90% rate, approximately 135 cars are rented each day.\n\nBut again, adding them up gives me 487.5 + 270 = 757.5 cars for the week, which is more than the total number of cars available.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the cars are being rented multiple times in a week, meaning some cars are rented on multiple days.\n\nBut the problem says \"how many cars can be expected to be rented on a typical week?\" It might be asking for the total number of rentals, considering that a single car can be rented multiple times if it's returned before the end of the week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the average number of cars rented out per day over the week.\n\nBut the question seems to be about the total number of cars rented in a week.\n\nLet me consider that each rental is for one day, and cars can be rented multiple times in a week.\n\nIn that case, the total number of rentals in a week would indeed be the sum of daily rentals.\n\nSo, total rentals in a week = (5 days * 97.5 cars/day) + (2 days * 135 cars/day) = 487.5 + 270 = 757.5 rentals.\n\nBut if the question is asking for the number of distinct cars rented in a week, considering that cars can be rented multiple times, then the total number of rentals could exceed the number of cars.\n\nHowever, perhaps the question is asking for the average number of cars rented out per day over the week, multiplied by the number of days, which would give the total rentals.\n\nBut I need to be careful with the interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total number of car Rentals in a week, considering the daily rental rates.\n\nIn that case, 757.5 Rentals would be the answer, but it seems odd to have a fraction of a rental.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of cars that are rented at least once during the week.\n\nThat would be different from the total number of Rentals.\n\nI think I need to clarify what is being asked.\n\nLet me look back at the question: \"how many cars can be expected to be rented on a typical week?\"\n\nThis seems a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted in different ways.\n\nOption 1: Total number of Rentals in a week, where a single car can be rented multiple times.\n\nOption 2: The total number of distinct cars that are rented at least once during the week.\n\nOption 3: The average number of cars rented out per day over the week, multiplied by the number of days, to get a weekly total.\n\nGiven that cars can be rented multiple times in a week, the total number of Rentals could exceed the number of cars.\n\nBut the question says \"cars rented\", which might refer to the number of cars that are rented at least once during the week.\n\nHowever, considering the rental rates for weekdays and weekends, it's more likely that it's asking for the total number of Rentals in a week.\n\nBut this leads to the total exceeding the number of cars, which might not make sense in reality, unless cars are being rented multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rental rates are such that a certain percentage of the cars are rented each day, and cars are returned by the end of the day.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the average number of cars rented per day, and then multiply by the number of days in the week.\n\nUsing the weighted average rental rate I calculated earlier, which was approximately 72.14%, I can find the average number of cars rented per day.\n\n72.14% of 150 cars is:\n\n0.7214 * 150 \u2248 108.21 cars per day\n\nThen, for a week (7 days), the total number of cars rented would be:\n\n108.21 cars/day * 7 days = 757.47 cars\n\nAgain, this is the same total as before, approximately 757.5 cars.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent because the company only has 150 cars.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the rental rates are applied to the entire fleet each day, and cars can be rented multiple times in a week.\n\nIn that case, the total number of Rentals in a week would indeed be higher than the number of cars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rental rates are for the entire week, but that doesn't make sense because they're specified separately for weekdays and weekends.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each car can be rented out multiple times in a week, depending on how many days it's rented.\n\nFor example, if a car is rented every day of the week, that would be 7 Rentals for that car.\n\nBut that seems extreme.\n\nAlternatively, if a car is rented only once during the week, then the total number of Rentals would be equal to the number of distinct cars rented during the week.\n\nBut given the rental rates, it's likely that some cars are rented multiple times.\n\nI think the key here is to interpret what \"cars rented\" means in this context.\n\nIf it means the total number of Rentals, where each rental is a car being rented on a particular day, then the total for the week would be the sum of daily Rentals.\n\nIn this case, total Rentals in a week = (5 weekdays * 97.5 Rentals/day) + (2 weekend days * 135 Rentals/day) = 487.5 + 270 = 757.5 Rentals.\n\nBut since we can't have half a Rental, perhaps it should be rounded to 758 Rentals.\n\nAlternatively, if \"cars rented\" refers to the number of distinct cars that are rented at least once during the week, then it would be lower, not exceeding the total number of cars available.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll provide both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Total Rentals in a week.\n\nUsing the daily rental rates:\n\nWeekday Rentals: 5 days * 97.5 = 487.5\n\nWeekend Rentals: 2 days * 135 = 270\n\nTotal Rentals: 487.5 + 270 = 757.5, which I'll round to 758 Rentals.\n\nSecond interpretation: Number of distinct cars rented at least once during the week.\n\nThis would be the number of cars that are rented on at least one day of the week.\n\nTo calculate this, I need to consider the probability that a car is not rented at all during the week, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that a car is rented at least once.\n\nThen, multiply by the total number of cars to get the expected number of distinct cars rented.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- P(not rented on a weekday) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35\n\n- P(not rented on a weekend day) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10\n\nAssuming that the rental on each day is independent, the probability that a car is not rented at all during the week is:\n\nP(not rented all week) = P(not rented on weekday)^5 * P(not rented on weekend)^2\n\n= (0.35)^5 * (0.10)^2\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 0.35^5:\n\n0.35 * 0.35 = 0.1225\n\n0.1225 * 0.35 = 0.042875\n\n0.042875 * 0.35 = 0.01500625\n\n0.01500625 * 0.35 = 0.0052521875\n\nNow, 0.10^2 = 0.01\n\nSo, P(not rented all week) = 0.0052521875 * 0.01 = 0.000052521875\n\nThen, P(rented at least once) = 1 - P(not rented all week) = 1 - 0.000052521875 \u2248 0.999947478125\n\nTherefore, the expected number of distinct cars rented at least once during the week is:\n\n150 cars * 0.999947478125 \u2248 149.992 cars\n\nWhich, for all practical purposes, is 150 cars.\n\nThis makes sense because with such high rental rates, especially on weekends, it's very likely that almost all cars are rented at least once during the week.\n\nSo, under this interpretation, the expected number of distinct cars rented in a week is approximately 150.\n\nNow, considering both interpretations, the first one gives a total of about 758 Rentals, and the second one gives approximately 150 distinct cars rented.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the question, both could be plausible answers, depending on the interpretation of \"cars rented.\"\n\nHowever, since the company only has 150 cars, and the first interpretation results in a number exceeding that, it's possible that the question intends for the second interpretation, i.e., the number of distinct cars rented at least once during the week.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's another way to interpret \"cars rented on a typical week.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average number of cars rented out per day, multiplied by the number of days in the week, which would give a sense of the total car-rental instances in a week.\n\nThis would align with the first interpretation, resulting in 757.5 Rentals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the total number of car-days rented in a week, which again would be 757.5 car-days.\n\nIn the context of car rentals, \"rented cars\" could refer to the number of rental transactions, which would be the total Rentals, or it could refer to the number of unique cars that were rented during the week.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the most straightforward answer is the total number of car Rentals in a week, which is 758.\n\nBut considering the potential for a car to be rented multiple times in a week, and the total Rentals exceeding the number of cars, it's essential to clarify the question's intent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average number of cars rented out simultaneously over the week.\n\nIn that case, it would be the average number of cars rented per day, which is approximately 108.21 cars per day, multiplied by 7 days, giving 757.47 cars, which again exceeds the total number of cars.\n\nThis suggests that the average number of cars rented out simultaneously over the week isn't a meaningful metric in this context, as it can't exceed the total number of cars available.\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to think in terms of the total number of car-days rented in a week.\n\nEach car rented for one day contributes one car-day.\n\nSo, if a car is rented for multiple days, it contributes multiple car-days.\n\nIn this case, the total car-days rented in a week would be the sum of daily rentals, which is 757.5 car-days.\n\nBut the question asks for the number of cars rented, not the number of car-days.\n\nPerhaps \"cars rented\" is being used colloquially to mean the total car-days rented.\n\nAlternatively, it could be interpreted as the total number of rental transactions, where each rental transaction is a car being rented for a day.\n\nIn that case, again, 757.5 rental transactions would be the answer.\n\nHowever, given the potential for confusion, and considering that the company only has 150 cars, it's possible that the question is asking for the number of distinct cars rented during the week, which, as per the second interpretation, is approximately 150 cars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of car rentals in a week, considering that each rental is for one day, and cars can be rented multiple times.\n\nIn that case, 757.5 rentals would be the answer.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the most accurate answer, considering the potential for cars to be rented multiple times, is the total number of rentals, which is approximately 758.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps the best approach is to provide both interpretations and their corresponding answers.\n\nFirst interpretation: Total number of car Rentals in a week, considering each daily rental as a separate rental transaction. In this case, the total is approximately 758 Rentals.\n\nSecond interpretation: Number of distinct cars rented at least once during the week. In this case, it's approximately 150 cars.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer should be that approximately 758 car Rentals can be expected in a typical week, involving all 150 cars being rented multiple times.\n\nHowever, considering that the question asks for \"cars rented,\" which might refer to the number of distinct cars rented during the week, the answer would be approximately 150 cars.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider yet another approach.\n\nLet's consider the total number of car-days rented in a week.\n\nEach car rented for one day contributes one car-day.\n\nSo, if a car is rented for multiple days, it contributes multiple car-days.\n\nGiven that, the total car-days rented in a week would be:\n\n(5 weekdays * 97.5 car-days) + (2 weekend days * 135 car-days) = 487.5 + 270 = 757.5 car-days\n\nThis aligns with the first interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for the number of distinct cars rented during the week, it would be approximately 150 cars, as calculated earlier.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer should be that approximately 150 distinct cars are rented during a typical week.\n\nBut this seems to underestimate the total rental activity, as cars can be rented multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of car Rentals in a week, which would be approximately 758 Rentals.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that \"cars rented\" refers to the total number of car Rentals in a week, which is approximately 758.\n\nTherefore, the car rental company can expect approximately 758 car Rentals in a typical week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{758} \\]"
