        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. So, you have a right triangle with legs measuring 6 cm and 8 cm, and you need to find the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what the Pythagorean theorem states. It says that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). This is often written as:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the length of the hypotenuse, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the other two legs.\n\nIn your problem, the legs are given as 6 cm and 8 cm. So, we can assign \\( a = 6 \\) cm and \\( b = 8 \\) cm. Our goal is to find \\( c \\).\n\nLet's plug the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ c^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the squares of 6 and 8:\n\n\\[ 6^2 = 36 \\]\n\\[ 8^2 = 64 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ c^2 = 36 + 64 \\]\n\\[ c^2 = 100 \\]\n\nTo find \\( c \\), we need to take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{100} \\]\n\\[ c = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm.\n\nJust to make sure, let's verify this. We can check if \\( 10^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 100 = 36 + 64 \\]\n\\[ 100 = 100 \\]\n\nYes, it checks out. So, the hypotenuse is indeed 10 cm.\n\nAlternatively, you might recognize that 6, 8, 10 is a Pythagorean triple, which is a set of three positive integers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) that fit the Pythagorean theorem. Common triples include 3-4-5, 5-12-13, and so on. So, once you see 6 and 8, you might guess that the hypotenuse is 10, but it's always good to verify using the theorem.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that the Pythagorean theorem only applies to right triangles. If the triangle weren't right-angled, we'd need to use different methods, like the law of cosines.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem is perfect.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this or any other topic?"
