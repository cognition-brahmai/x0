The profit margin on each item is as follows: Item A has a 30% profit margin, Item B has a 40% profit margin, and Item C has a 50% profit margin. If the store sells 100 units of Item A at $20 each, 80 units of Item B at $25 each, and 60 units of Item C at $30 each, what is the total profit earned from selling all these items?"

First, I need to find out the profit for each type of item and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with Item A:\n\n- Number of units sold: 100\n\n- Selling price per unit: $20\n\n- Profit margin: 30%\n\nTo find the profit per unit for Item A, I can calculate 30% of $20.\n\nProfit per unit for Item A = 30% of $20 = 0.30 * 20 = $6\n\nNow, total profit from Item A = number of units * profit per unit = 100 * 6 = $600\n\nNext, Item B:\n\n- Number of units sold: 80\n\n- Selling price per unit: $25\n\n- Profit margin: 40%\n\nProfit per unit for Item B = 40% of $25 = 0.40 * 25 = $10\n\nTotal profit from Item B = 80 * 10 = $800\n\nNow, Item C:\n\n- Number of units sold: 60\n\n- Selling price per unit: $30\n\n- Profit margin: 50%\n\nProfit per unit for Item C = 50% of $30 = 0.50 * 30 = $15\n\nTotal profit from Item C = 60 * 15 = $900\n\nFinally, to find the total profit from all items, I'll add up the profits from A, B, and C.\n\nTotal profit = profit from A + profit from B + profit from C = 600 + 800 + 900 = $2300\n\nSo, the total profit earned from selling all these items is $2300."
