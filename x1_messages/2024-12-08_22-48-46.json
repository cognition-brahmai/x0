        "content": "A computer first defeated a human chess champion in 1997. The match was between IBM's supercomputer, Deep Blue, and the then-world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. In a highly publicized six-game match, Deep Blue emerged victorious with two wins, one loss, and three draws. This event marked a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence and computer technology, demonstrating that machines could outperform humans in complex strategic games like chess."
