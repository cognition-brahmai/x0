        "content": "So I have this problem: If a car factory produces 15 cars every hour, how many cars will it produce in a year? Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many hours there are in a year because the production rate is given per hour. I know that there are 24 hours in a day and 365 days in a year, right? Wait, but sometimes there are 366 days in a leap year, but maybe for now, I'll assume it's not a leap year.\n\nSo, total hours in a year would be 24 hours/day times 365 days/year. Let me calculate that:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 8,760 hours/year.\n\nAlright, so there are 8,760 hours in a year.\n\nNow, if the factory produces 15 cars every hour, then the total production in a year would be 15 cars/hour times 8,760 hours/year.\n\nSo, 15 cars/hour \u00d7 8,760 hours/year = ?\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n15 \u00d7 8,760.\n\nWell, 15 times 8,000 is 120,000.\n\n15 times 760 is let's see:\n\n15 times 700 is 10,500.\n\n15 times 60 is 900.\n\nSo, 10,500 + 900 = 11,400.\n\nNow, add that to 120,000:\n\n120,000 + 11,400 = 131,400.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 131,400 cars in a year.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check my multiplication.\n\n15 times 8,760.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 15 times 8760.\n\nLet me multiply 10 times 8,760, which is 87,600.\n\nThen 5 times 8,760 is half of that, which is 43,800.\n\nAdding them together: 87,600 + 43,800 = 131,400.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nBut is there another way to verify this?\n\nWell, I could use a different approach. For example, calculate monthly production and then multiply by 12.\n\nFirst, find out how many hours there are in a month.\n\nAssuming an average month has about 30 days, then hours per month would be 24 hours/day times 30 days/month, which is 720 hours/month.\n\nThen, production per month would be 15 cars/hour times 720 hours/month, which is 10,800 cars/month.\n\nThen, for 12 months, it would be 10,800 cars/month times 12 months, which is 129,600 cars/year.\n\nHmm, that's different from my previous calculation of 131,400.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact number of days in a year instead of assuming 30 days per month.\n\nIn the first method, I used 365 days/year, which is 8,760 hours/year.\n\nIn the second method, using 30 days/month, which is 720 hours/month, and then 12 months, which is 8,640 hours/year.\n\nWait, 720 hours/month times 12 months is 8,640 hours/year, which is less than the 8,760 hours in a year.\n\nThat's why there's a discrepancy.\n\nSo, the first method is more accurate because it uses the exact number of days in a year.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 131,400 cars in a year.\n\nBut, maybe the factory doesn't operate 24 hours a day. Maybe it has shifts or downtime.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it operates 24/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider standard business hours.\n\nLet me check the problem again.\n\nIt says \"a car factory produces 15 cars every hour.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify if this is per hour of operation or per hour of the day.\n\nBut since it says \"every hour,\" I think it's safe to assume it's per hour of operation.\n\nHowever, if it's operating 24/7, then my initial calculation holds.\n\nBut maybe factories have maintenance downtime or don't operate around the clock.\n\nI don't know for sure, but since it's not specified, I'll stick with the initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"15 cars every hour\" is the average production rate over the year, taking into account all operational hours.\n\nIn that case, the total production would indeed be 15 cars/hour times the number of hours operated in a year.\n\nBut without more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that it operates 24/7.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 131,400 cars in a year.\n\nWait, but in the second method, I got 129,600 cars/year when assuming 30 days/month.\n\nThe difference is due to the fact that a year has 365 days, not exactly 12 months of 30 days each.\n\nSo, the first method is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to use the monthly approach, I should account for the exact number of days in each month.\n\nBut that would be more complicated, and since the first method is straightforward, I'll stick with that.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 131,400 cars in a year.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider leap years.\n\nA leap year has 366 days instead of 365.\n\nSo, if it's a leap year, the total hours would be 24 \u00d7 366 = 8,784 hours.\n\nThen, production would be 15 \u00d7 8,784 = 131,760 cars in a leap year.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, and leap years are exceptions, I'll assume it's a non-leap year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 131,400 cars in a year.\n\nBut maybe I should present both scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory operates only during business hours, say 8 hours a day.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total hours of operation would be different.\n\nBut again, the problem states \"produces 15 cars every hour,\" which seems to indicate continuous production.\n\nTherefore, I think the initial calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the factory produces 131,400 cars in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{131400} \\]"
