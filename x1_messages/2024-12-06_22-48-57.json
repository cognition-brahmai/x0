        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains moving towards each other from Station A and Station B, which are 450 miles apart. The first train from Station A is going at 60 mph, and the second train from Station B is going at 90 mph. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nOkay, so since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. That makes sense because the closer they get, the faster they approach each other. So, the combined speed should be 60 mph plus 90 mph, which is 150 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two stations is 450 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 450 miles / 150 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 450 divided by 150 is 3. So, the time should be 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the first train is going at 60 mph for 3 hours, it would cover 180 miles. The second train is going at 90 mph for 3 hours, covering 270 miles. Adding those up: 180 + 270 equals 450 miles, which is exactly the distance between the two stations.\n\nPerfect, that checks out. So, the two trains will meet after 3 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider another approach. Let's think about their relative speed again. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is indeed the sum of their individual speeds, which is 150 mph.\n\nSo, the time it takes for them to cover the 450 miles at this relative speed is again 450 divided by 150, which is 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to model the situation. Let\u2019s say they meet after t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train would have traveled 60t miles, and the second train would have traveled 90t miles. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the total distance between the stations.\n\nSo:\n\n60t + 90t = 450\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n150t = 450\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 450 / 150\n\nt = 3 hours\n\nAgain, the same answer. This reinforces that 3 hours is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the time it takes for the distance between them to close from 450 miles to 0 miles, given their combined speed of 150 mph. So, time = distance / speed, which is 450 / 150 = 3 hours.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is definitely 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
