        "content": "So the restaurant serves 500 customers per day on average, and 25% of them order dessert. We need to find out how many desserts are sold in a week, given that the restaurant is open 7 days a week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many customers order dessert each day. Since 25% of the customers order dessert, we can calculate that by taking 25% of 500.\n\n25% of 500 is (25/100) * 500 = 0.25 * 500 = 125 customers per day.\n\nSo, 125 customers order dessert each day.\n\nNow, to find out how many desserts are sold in a week, we need to multiply the number of desserts sold per day by the number of days in a week.\n\nThe restaurant is open 7 days a week, so:\n\n125 desserts/day * 7 days/week = 875 desserts/week.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant sells 875 desserts in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{875} \\]"
