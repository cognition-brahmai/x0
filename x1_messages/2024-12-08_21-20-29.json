        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a movie theater has 20 rows with 15 seats in each row. I need to figure out how many people the theater can seat at maximum capacity. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The theater has multiple rows, and each row has a certain number of seats. To find the total seating capacity, I should probably multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row. That makes sense because that would give me the total number of seats available.\n\nSo, number of rows is 20, and seats per row is 15. So, total seats would be 20 times 15.\n\nNow, let's do the math. 20 multiplied by 15. I can think of this in a few ways. One way is to think of 15 as 10 plus 5, so 20 times 15 is the same as 20 times 10 plus 20 times 5.\n\n20 times 10 is 200, and 20 times 5 is 100. So, 200 plus 100 equals 300.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 10 times 15 is 150, so 20 times 15 would be double that, which is also 300.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. 10 times 15 is indeed 150, and 20 is twice that, so yes, 300.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 15 is just one and a half times 10, so 20 times 15 would be 20 times 10 plus half of that again. So, 20 times 10 is 200, half of 200 is 100, and adding those together gives 300.\n\nOkay, so no matter which way I look at it, I'm getting 300 as the total number of seats.\n\nBut, let's consider if there might be any other factors to consider. For example, are there any seats that might not be available for some reason, like aisles or reserved seats? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that all seats are available for seating.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the question is about maximum seating capacity, which would mean that every seat is occupied. So, in this case, the theater can seat up to 300 people.\n\nWait, but I should probably consider if there are any walkways or spots that aren't seats. But according to the problem, there are 20 rows with 15 seats each, so I think it's straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can visualize the seating arrangement. If there are 20 rows, and each row has 15 seats, it's like a grid of 20 by 15. So, 20 multiplied by 15 equals 300 seats.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to add up the seats row by row, 15 seats per row for 20 rows, that's 15 plus 15, added together 20 times, which again would be 300.\n\nI feel pretty confident about this answer. But, to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look up a similar problem or think of real-world examples.\n\nFor instance, in many movie theaters, the number of seats per row can vary, but in this case, it's uniform with 15 seats per row. So, 20 rows of 15 seats each should indeed be 300 seats.\n\nI don't think there's any need to overcomplicate this. It's a straightforward multiplication problem.\n\nSo, the theater can seat a maximum of 300 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
