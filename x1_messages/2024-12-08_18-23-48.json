        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to 20) using recursion.\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 5  # You can change this value to any non-negative integer <= 20\nif n >= 0 and n <= 20:\n    print(f\"The factorial of {n} is {factorial(n)}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Please enter a non-negative integer less than or equal to 20.\")\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `factorial` that computes the factorial of `n` recursively. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the factorial is 1. For other values of `n`, the function calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case.\n\nYou can change the value of `n` in the example usage section to compute the factorial of different numbers, provided that `n` is between 0 and 20 inclusive."
