        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The car rental company charges two things: a daily rate and a per-mile rate. The daily rate is $20 per day, and the per-mile rate is $0.10 per mile. The customer rents the car for 5 days and drives it for 200 miles. We need to find the total cost.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the cost for the days rented. Since it's $20 per day for 5 days, we can multiply 20 by 5.\n\n20 * 5 = 100\n\nSo, the cost for the days rented is $100.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the cost for the miles driven. It's $0.10 per mile for 200 miles. So, we multiply 0.10 by 200.\n\n0.10 * 200 = 20\n\nSo, the cost for the miles driven is $20.\n\nNow, we'll add both costs to get the total cost.\n\n100 + 20 = 120\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the rental is $120.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there's a formula or something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think. Total cost equals the daily rate multiplied by the number of days plus the per-mile rate multiplied by the number of miles driven.\n\nSo, Total Cost = (Daily Rate * Number of Days) + (Per-Mile Rate * Miles Driven)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal Cost = (20 * 5) + (0.10 * 200) = 100 + 20 = 120\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a package deal or some sort of discount, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So, I think $120 is the straightforward answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other costs that might be added, like tax or insurance. However, the problem only mentions the daily charge and the per-mile charge. It doesn't mention any additional fees. So, I think $120 is the total cost.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total cost per day including miles driven, but that might complicate things unnecessarily. The straightforward approach seems best here.\n\nSo, the total cost is $120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
