        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 2000 widgets per day, and its production rate increases by 5% each week. We need to find out how many widgets it will produce on the 4th week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The production rate increases by 5% each week, which means that every week, the daily production rate goes up by 5% compared to the previous week.\n\nSo, starting with week 1:\n\n- Week 1: 2000 widgets per day.\n\nThen, each subsequent week, the daily production increases by 5%.\n\n- Week 2: 2000 * 1.05 = 2100 widgets per day.\n\n- Week 3: 2100 * 1.05 = 2205 widgets per day.\n\n- Week 4: 2205 * 1.05 = ??\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way to calculate this without doing it step by step each week.\n\nI recall that when something increases by a certain percentage each period, it's exponential growth. So, the formula for exponential growth is:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1 + rate)^time\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Initial amount = 2000 widgets per day.\n\n- Rate = 5% per week = 0.05.\n\n- Time = 4 weeks.\n\nSo, the daily production on the 4th week would be:\n\n2000 * (1 + 0.05)^4\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.05)^4:\n\n1.05^4\n\nI know that 1.05 squared is 1.1025.\n\nSo, 1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625.\n\nThen, 1.157625 * 1.05 = approximately 1.21550625.\n\nSo, daily production on the 4th week:\n\n2000 * 1.21550625 \u2248 2431.0125 widgets per day.\n\nBut since we're dealing with widgets, which are discrete items, probably should round to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, approximately 2431 widgets per day on the 4th week.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the number of widgets produced on the 4th week, not per day. A week has 7 days, so total weekly production would be daily production multiplied by 7.\n\nSo, 2431 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 17017 widgets per week.\n\nTherefore, in the 4th week, the factory will produce approximately 17017 widgets.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 2000 widgets/day.\n\nAfter week 1: 2000\n\nAfter week 2: 2000 * 1.05 = 2100\n\nAfter week 3: 2100 * 1.05 = 2205\n\nAfter week 4: 2205 * 1.05 = 2315.25\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 1.05^4.\n\nLet me recalculate 1.05^4.\n\n1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\n1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625\n\n1.157625 * 1.05 = approximately 1.21550625\n\nSo, 2000 * 1.21550625 = 2431.0125 widgets/day.\n\nThen, 2431.0125 * 7 = 17017.0875\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, 17017 widgets.\n\nBut according to my step-by-step calculation:\n\n- Week 1: 2000 widgets/day\n\n- Week 2: 2000 * 1.05 = 2100\n\n- Week 3: 2100 * 1.05 = 2205\n\n- Week 4: 2205 * 1.05 = 2315.25 widgets/day\n\nThen, 2315.25 * 7 = 16206.75 widgets/week\n\nThis doesn't match my earlier calculation of 17017.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misapplied the exponential growth formula.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe production rate increases by 5% each week, meaning that at the start of each week, the daily production rate is 5% higher than the previous week.\n\nSo, the daily production at the start of week 1 is 2000.\n\nWeek 2: 2000 * 1.05 = 2100\n\nWeek 3: 2100 * 1.05 = 2205\n\nWeek 4: 2205 * 1.05 = 2315.25\n\nSo, daily production in week 4 is 2315.25 widgets/day.\n\nThen, weekly production is 2315.25 * 7 = 16206.75 widgets/week.\n\nBut according to the exponential growth formula:\n\n2000 * (1.05)^4 = 2000 * 1.21550625 = 2431.0125 widgets/day.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. There's a\u77db\u76fe here.\n\nUnless the exponential growth formula is applied differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the production increases by 5% each week, but the week has 7 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production increases by 5% weekly, meaning that the daily production rate is multiplied by 1.05 at the start of each week.\n\nIn that case, starting from week 1: 2000 widgets/day.\n\nWeek 2: 2000 * 1.05 = 2100 widgets/day.\n\nWeek 3: 2100 * 1.05 = 2205 widgets/day.\n\nWeek 4: 2205 * 1.05 = 2315.25 widgets/day.\n\nThen, total production in week 4: 2315.25 * 7 = 16206.75 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the exponential growth formula for the entire week:\n\nInitial daily production: 2000.\n\nGrowth rate: 5% per week.\n\nTime: 4 weeks.\n\nSo, daily production after 4 weeks: 2000 * (1.05)^4 = 2000 * 1.21550625 = 2431.0125 widgets/day.\n\nThen, weekly production: 2431.0125 * 7 = 17017.0875 widgets.\n\nBut this contradicts the step-by-step calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the discrepancy is due to rounding errors.\n\nLet me calculate (1.05)^4 more precisely.\n\n1.05^1 = 1.05\n\n1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\n1.05^3 = 1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625\n\n1.05^4 = 1.157625 * 1.05 = 1.21550625\n\nSo, 2000 * 1.21550625 = 2431.0125 widgets/day.\n\nBut according to step-by-step:\n\nWeek 1: 2000\n\nWeek 2: 2000 * 1.05 = 2100\n\nWeek 3: 2100 * 1.05 = 2205\n\nWeek 4: 2205 * 1.05 = 2315.25\n\nWait, there's a difference between 2315.25 and 2431.0125.\n\nThat doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf the production increases by 5% each week, does that mean that each week's daily production is 5% higher than the previous week's daily production?\n\nIf so, then:\n\n- Week 1: 2000 widgets/day\n\n- Week 2: 2000 * 1.05 = 2100 widgets/day\n\n- Week 3: 2100 * 1.05 = 2205 widgets/day\n\n- Week 4: 2205 * 1.05 = 2315.25 widgets/day\n\nThen, total production in week 4: 2315.25 * 7 = 16206.75 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, if the 5% increase is applied to the weekly production rather than the daily production, then:\n\nFirst, calculate the weekly production for week 1:\n\n2000 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 14,000 widgets/week.\n\nThen, week 2: 14,000 * 1.05 = 14,700\n\nWeek 3: 14,700 * 1.05 = 15,435\n\nWeek 4: 15,435 * 1.05 = 16,206.75 widgets.\n\nThis matches the step-by-step calculation above.\n\nBut this approach seems inconsistent with the initial interpretation of the daily production increasing by 5% each week.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is ambiguous about whether the 5% increase applies to the daily production or the weekly production.\n\nIf it's the daily production that increases by 5% each week, then:\n\n- Day 1 (week 1): 2000\n\n- Day 2 (week 1): 2000\n\n...\n\n- Day 7 (week 1): 2000\n\nTotal week 1: 2000 * 7 = 14,000\n\n- Day 1 (week 2): 2000 * 1.05 = 2100\n\n- Day 2 (week 2): 2100\n\n...\n\n- Day 7 (week 2): 2100\n\nTotal week 2: 2100 * 7 = 14,700\n\n- Week 3: 2100 * 1.05 = 2205 per day \u2192 2205 * 7 = 15,435\n\n- Week 4: 2205 * 1.05 = 2315.25 per day \u2192 2315.25 * 7 = 16,206.75\n\nAlternatively, if the weekly production increases by 5% each week:\n\n- Week 1: 14,000\n\n- Week 2: 14,000 * 1.05 = 14,700\n\n- Week 3: 14,700 * 1.05 = 15,435\n\n- Week 4: 15,435 * 1.05 = 16,206.75\n\nSo, both interpretations lead to the same weekly production numbers.\n\nBut earlier, when I used the exponential growth formula on the daily production and multiplied by 7, I got 17,017, which doesn't match the 16,206.75 from the step-by-step approach.\n\nThere must be a mistake in applying the exponential growth formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nThe exponential growth formula is:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1 + rate)^time\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is the daily production, and time is in weeks.\n\nBut since the daily production is increasing each week, and there are 7 days in a week, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula should be applied to the weekly production directly.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nInitial weekly production: 2000 * 7 = 14,000 widgets/week.\n\nGrowth rate: 5% per week.\n\nTime: 4 weeks.\n\nSo, weekly production in week 4:\n\n14,000 * (1.05)^3\n\nWait, why ^3? If we start with week 1 as the initial amount, then week 4 is three increases beyond week 1.\n\nSo, 14,000 * (1.05)^3 = 14,000 * 1.157625 = 16,206.75 widgets.\n\nThis matches the step-by-step calculation.\n\nBut earlier, when I applied the formula to daily production and multiplied by 7, I got a different number.\n\nSo, it seems the correct approach is to apply the weekly growth rate to the weekly production.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce approximately 16,207 widgets in the 4th week.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"the 4th week,\" which could be interpreted as the fourth week starting from week 1.\n\nSo, if week 1 is the first week, then week 4 is three weeks later, which aligns with applying the growth rate three times.\n\nHence, the correct calculation is:\n\nWeek 1: 14,000\n\nWeek 2: 14,000 * 1.05 = 14,700\n\nWeek 3: 14,700 * 1.05 = 15,435\n\nWeek 4: 15,435 * 1.05 = 16,206.75\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce approximately 16,207 widgets in the 4th week.\n\nThe initial approach using exponential growth on daily production and then multiplying by 7 was incorrect because it effectively applied the growth rate four times to the daily rate and then scaled it to a week, which overestimates the weekly production.\n\nSo, the correct answer is approximately 16,207 widgets in the 4th week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16207} \\]"
