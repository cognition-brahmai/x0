        "content": "Let's see. Alice bought a combination of apples and oranges. Apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each. She bought a total of 5 fruits and spent $7. I need to figure out how many oranges she bought.\n\nFirst, let's set up some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) represent the number of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) represent the number of oranges.\n\nFrom the problem, I know two things:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 5. So, \\( a + o = 5 \\).\n\n2. The total cost is $7. Since apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each, the cost equation would be \\( 1a + 2o = 7 \\).\n\nSo, I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( a + 2o = 7 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( o \\), the number of oranges.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( a + o = 5 \\), I can solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 5 - o \\)\n\nNow, plug this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( (5 - o) + 2o = 7 \\)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( 5 - o + 2o = 7 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 5 + o = 7 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\( o = 2 \\)\n\nSo, Alice bought 2 oranges.\n\nWait, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf she bought 2 oranges, at $2 each, that's \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) dollars.\n\nThen, the number of apples would be \\( 5 - 2 = 3 \\), and apples cost $1 each, so \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal cost: \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\) dollars, which matches the total given.\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try another method to confirm.\n\nLet's try elimination.\n\nStart with the two equations again:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( a + 2o = 7 \\)\n\nIf I subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\( (a + 2o) - (a + o) = 7 - 5 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( a + 2o - a - o = 2 \\)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n\\( o = 2 \\)\n\nAgain, 2 oranges.\n\nAlternatively, I could graph the equations, but that's more time-consuming.\n\nOr, think about it logically.\n\nIf she bought all apples (5 apples), that would cost \\( 5 \\times 1 = 5 \\) dollars, which is less than $7.\n\nEach time she buys an orange instead of an apple, she spends an extra $1 (since oranges are $2 and apples are $1, the difference is $1 per fruit).\n\nShe needs to make up $7 - $5 = $2.\n\nSo, she needs to buy 2 oranges instead of apples to make up the extra $2.\n\nThus, she buys 2 oranges and 3 apples.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nI think it's confirmed. She bought 2 oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
