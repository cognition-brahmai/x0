        "content": "To determine the future value of an investment that grows at a constant annual rate, we can use the formula for compound interest. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} = \\text{Present Value} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{\\text{rate}}{100}\\right)^{\\text{number of years}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Present Value (PV) = $50,000\n- Annual growth rate (r) = 8%\n- Number of years (t) = 5\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} = 50,000 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{8}{100}\\right)^5 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} = 50,000 \\times (1.08)^5 \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( (1.08)^5 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.08)^5 \\approx 1.469328 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} \\approx 50,000 \\times 1.469328 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} \\approx 73,466.40 \\]\n\nTherefore, after 5 years, the investment will be worth approximately $73,466.40.\n\n**Alternative Method: Using Compound Interest Formula**\n\nThe compound interest formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, since the interest is compounded annually, n = 1.\n\nSo the formula simplifies to:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nGiven:\n- P = $50,000\n- r = 8% or 0.08\n- t = 5 years\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times (1 + 0.08)^5 \\]\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times (1.08)^5 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1.08)^5 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.08)^5 \\approx 1.469328 \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ A \\approx 50,000 \\times 1.469328 \\]\n\\[ A \\approx 73,466.40 \\]\n\nSo, the investment will be worth approximately $73,466.40 after 5 years.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Initial Investment (P):** $50,000\n\n2. **Annual Growth Rate (r):** 8% or 0.08\n\n3. **Number of Years (t):** 5\n\n4. **Calculate the growth factor:** \\( 1 + r = 1 + 0.08 = 1.08 \\)\n\n5. **Raise the growth factor to the power of t:** \\( 1.08^5 \\)\n\n   - \\( 1.08^1 = 1.08 \\)\n   - \\( 1.08^2 = 1.1664 \\)\n   - \\( 1.08^3 = 1.259712 \\)\n   - \\( 1.08^4 = 1.36048896 \\)\n   - \\( 1.08^5 = 1.4693280768 \\)\n\n6. **Multiply the initial investment by the growth factor:**\n\n   \\[ A = 50,000 \\times 1.4693280768 \\approx 73,466.40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the investment will be worth approximately $73,466.40 after 5 years.\n\n**Verification Using Linear Approximation:**\n\nFor a rough estimate, we can use the rule of 72 to estimate the doubling time, but since we are dealing with a 5-year period, let's use the simple interest formula for comparison.\n\nSimple Interest Formula:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r t) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times (1 + 0.08 \\times 5) \\]\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times (1 + 0.4) \\]\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times 1.4 \\]\n\\[ A = 70,000 \\]\n\nComparing this to the compound interest calculation of approximately $73,466.40, we can see that compound interest yields a higher amount due to interest being earned on the accumulated interest each year.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe investment will be worth approximately $73,466.40 after 5 years, given an annual growth rate of 8%."
