It's like having a built-in support system, you know? Someone who knows all your secrets and still loves you anyway.\n\nI guess it's like having a family, but you choose them yourself. Your friends are the family you pick. And just like with family, there are good times and bad times, but through it all, you stick together.\n\nRemember that time when Chandler and I had that whole thing with the Soup Nazi? That was crazy, but we went through it together. That's what friends do, they go through stuff with you, even if it's just getting soup.\n\nAnd sometimes, friends can be a pain in the neck. Like when Phoebe does her cat lady routine, or when Ross goes on one of his dinosaur tangents. But you love them anyway, because that's just part of who they are.\n\nFriendship is also about being there for each other, like when someone's going through a tough time. Remember when Chandler was going through his divorce? We were all there for him, supporting him, even though we didn't always know what to say.\n\nAnd it's not just about the big things; it's also about the little moments, like sharing a laugh over something stupid, or commiserating over a bad day at work. Those moments add up and make the friendship stronger.\n\nSo, I guess friendship is like a safety net. You know that no matter where life takes you, you've got these people who care about you and will catch you if you fall.\n\nBut it's also about growing together. As you go through life, your friends help shape who you are, and you do the same for them.\n\nIn the end, friendship is about choosing to be there for someone, through thick and thin, and knowing that they'll do the same for you.\n\nSo, that's what friendship means to me.\n\nJoey)"
