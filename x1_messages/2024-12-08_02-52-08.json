        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion. We'll also make sure to handle invalid inputs and display appropriate error messages.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120. By definition, 0! is 1.\n\nNow, recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. For factorial, the recursive definition is:\n\n- n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)! for n > 0\n\n- 0! = 1\n\nSo, in Python, we can define a function that calls itself with a smaller value until it reaches the base case, which is when n is 0.\n\nBut we also need to handle invalid inputs. Invalid inputs could be negative integers, non-integer values, or any other type that isn't a non-negative integer.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Define a function, say `factorial`, that takes an integer n as input.\n\n2. Check if n is a non-negative integer.\n\n- If n is not an integer, raise a TypeError.\n\n- If n is a negative integer, raise a ValueError.\n\n3. If n is 0, return 1.\n\n4. If n is greater than 0, return n multiplied by the factorial of n-1.\n\n5. In the main part of the script, take user input, convert it to an integer, and call the factorial function.\n\n6. Handle any exceptions that are raised and display appropriate error messages.\n\nLet's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, define the factorial function:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nNext, in the main part of the script, take user input and call the factorial function:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        user_input = input(\"Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial: \")\n        n = int(user_input)\n        result = factorial(n)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {n} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as ve:\n        print(f\"Error: {ve}\")\n    except TypeError as te:\n        print(f\"Error: {te}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nLet's put it all together:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        user_input = input(\"Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial: \")\n        n = int(user_input)\n        result = factorial(n)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {n} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError as ve:\n        print(f\"Error: {ve}\")\n    except TypeError as te:\n        print(f\"Error: {te}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nThis script will prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer, calculate its factorial using recursion, and handle any invalid inputs by displaying appropriate error messages.\n\nOne thing to note is that recursion in Python has a default recursion limit, which is usually set to 1000. So for very large values of n, you might hit the recursion limit. In such cases, you can increase the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit()`, but be cautious as this can lead to a stack overflow if not handled properly.\n\nAlternatively, for larger values of n, you might want to use an iterative approach to avoid recursion depth issues.\n\nBut for now, this script should work fine for reasonably small values of n.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
