        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that analyzes web server log files. Sounds interesting! So, first things first, I need to understand what these log files look like. Typically, web server logs contain entries for each HTTP request made to the server. Each entry includes information like the IP address of the client, the request method (like GET, POST), the URL requested, and the response code.\n\nI need to parse these logs, extract the relevant information, and then generate a summary report with some statistics. The statistics requested are:\n\n1. Number of requests per IP address\n\n2. Most frequent URLs\n\n3. Distribution of response codes\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Log Format**\n\nI need to know the format of the log files to parse them correctly. Common log formats include the Combined Log Format, which looks something like this:\n\n```\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] \"GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0\" 200 2326\n\n```\n\nIn this format:\n\n- `127.0.0.1` is the IP address\n\n- `- -` are fields for client identity and user identity, often left empty\n\n- `[10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700]` is the timestamp\n\n- `\"GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0\"` is the request line\n\n- `200` is the HTTP response code\n\n- `2326` is the size of the response in bytes\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume the logs are in this Combined Log Format.\n\n**Step 2: Reading the Log File**\n\nI need to read the log file line by line. In Java, I can use `BufferedReader` to read the file efficiently.\n\n**Step 3: Parsing Each Log Entry**\n\nFor each line, I need to extract the IP address, request method, URL, and response code. Given the log format, I can use string splitting and parsing techniques to extract these fields.\n\n**Step 4: Storing the Parsed Data**\n\nI need to store the extracted information in a way that makes it easy to generate the required statistics. For example:\n\n- For requests per IP address, I can use a `Map<String, Integer>` where the key is the IP address and the value is the count of requests.\n\n- For most frequent URLs, another `Map<String, Integer>` where the key is the URL and the value is the request count.\n\n- For distribution of response codes, again a `Map<Integer, Integer>` where the key is the response code and the value is the count.\n\n**Step 5: Generating the Summary Report**\n\nOnce all log entries are parsed and data is stored, I can iterate through these maps to generate the summary report.\n\n- For requests per IP address, I can sort the map by value in descending order and print the top entries.\n\n- For most frequent URLs, similarly sort and print.\n\n- For response code distribution, list each code with its count.\n\n**Step 6: Handling Large Log Files**\n\nLog files can be very large, so I need to ensure that my program handles large files efficiently without consuming too much memory. Using `BufferedReader` helps in reading the file line by line, which is memory efficient.\n\n**Step 7: Error Handling**\n\nLogs might contain malformed entries. I need to handle such cases gracefully, perhaps by skipping invalid entries or logging an error and continuing.\n\n**Step 8: Command-Line Interface**\n\nI should design the program to accept the log file path as a command-line argument.\n\n**Step 9: Testing**\n\nI need to create sample log files to test the program, ensuring it correctly parses different types of entries and generates accurate statistics.\n\nAlright, with this plan in mind, let's start implementing the program.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Java program that analyzes web server log files. The program should parse the log files, extract information about HTTP requests (e.g., IP address, request method, URL, response code), and generate a summary report with statistics such as the number of requests per IP address, most frequent URLs, and distribution of response codes.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding the Log Format**: We assume the log files are in the Combined Log Format.\n2. **Reading the Log File**: Use `BufferedReader` to read the log file line by line efficiently.\n3. **Parsing Each Log Entry**: Extract relevant information like IP address, request method, URL, and response code from each log entry.\n4. **Storing Parsed Data**: Use `HashMap` to store counts of requests per IP address, frequency of URLs, and distribution of response codes.\n5. **Generating Summary Report**: Sort and print the statistics based on the stored data.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass LogAnalyzer {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length != 1) {\n            System.out.println(\"Usage: java LogAnalyzer <log_file_path>\");\n            return;\n        }\n        String logFilePath = args[0];\n        analyzeLog(logFilePath);\n    }\n\n    public static void analyzeLog(String logFilePath) {\n        Map<String, Integer> requestsPerIP = new HashMap<>();\n        Map<String, Integer> urlFrequency = new HashMap<>();\n        Map<Integer, Integer> responseCodeDistribution = new HashMap<>();\n\n        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(logFilePath))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                if (line.isEmpty()) continue;\n                String[] parts = line.split(\" \");\n                if (parts.length < 10) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Malformed log entry: \" + line);\n                    continue;\n                }\n                String ip = parts[0];\n                String requestLine = parts[5] + \" \" + parts[6] + \" \" + parts[7];\n                String url = requestLine.split(\" \")[1];\n                int responseCode = Integer.parseInt(parts[8]);\n\n                requestsPerIP.put(ip, requestsPerIP.getOrDefault(ip, 0) + 1);\n                urlFrequency.put(url, urlFrequency.getOrDefault(url, 0) + 1);\n                responseCodeDistribution.put(responseCode, responseCodeDistribution.getOrDefault(responseCode, 0) + 1);\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Requests per IP:\");\n        requestsPerIP.entrySet().stream()\n                .sorted(Map.Entry.<String, Integer>comparingByValue().reversed())\n                .forEach(entry -> System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue()));\n\n        System.out.println(\"\\nMost frequent URLs:\");\n        urlFrequency.entrySet().stream()\n                .sorted(Map.Entry.<String, Integer>comparingByValue().reversed())\n                .limit(10)\n                .forEach(entry -> System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue()));\n\n        System.out.println(\"\\nResponse code distribution:\");\n        responseCodeDistribution.entrySet().stream()\n                .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByKey())\n                .forEach(entry -> System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the Log File**: The log file is read line by line using `BufferedReader` for efficiency.\n2. **Parsing Each Log Entry**: Each log entry is split by spaces to extract the IP address, request line, and response code.\n3. **Storing Parsed Data**: `HashMap` is used to count requests per IP, frequency of URLs, and distribution of response codes.\n4. **Generating Summary Report**: The maps are sorted and printed to provide the required statistics.\n5. **Error Handling**: Malformed log entries are skipped with a warning message.\n\nThis program provides a straightforward way to analyze web server logs and generate useful statistics, which can help in monitoring and optimizing web server performance."
