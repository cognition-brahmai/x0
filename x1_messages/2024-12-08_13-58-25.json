        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of candy bars: type X and type Y. Type X costs $1.50 each, and type Y costs $2.00 each. A customer buys a total of 20 candy bars for $35.00, and we need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of type X candy bars as x and the number of type Y candy bars as y.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candy bars is 20.\n\n2. The total cost of the candy bars is $35.00.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. x + y = 20 (since the total number of candy bars is 20)\n\n2. 1.50x + 2.00y = 35.00 (since the total cost is $35.00)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables, which we can solve to find the values of x and y.\n\nLet's look at the first equation: x + y = 20. We can solve this equation for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, let's solve for x:\n\nx = 20 - y\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation to solve for y.\n\nSo, plugging x = 20 - y into the second equation:\n\n1.50(20 - y) + 2.00y = 35.00\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n1.50 * 20 - 1.50y + 2.00y = 35.00\n\n30 - 1.50y + 2.00y = 35.00\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n30 + (2.00y - 1.50y) = 35.00\n\n30 + 0.50y = 35.00\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n0.50y = 5.00\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50:\n\ny = 10\n\nSo, the number of type Y candy bars is 10.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation x = 20 - y to find x:\n\nx = 20 - 10 = 10\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 10 candy bars of type X and 10 candy bars of type Y.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they bought 10 of each type:\n\nCost of type X: 10 * 1.50 = 15.00\n\nCost of type Y: 10 * 2.00 = 20.00\n\nTotal cost: 15.00 + 20.00 = 35.00\n\nTotal candy bars: 10 + 10 = 20\n\nYes, this matches the given total cost and total number of candy bars.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used other methods to solve this system of equations, such as elimination or matrices, but substitution works well here, especially since one equation was already solved for x.\n\nIt's also worth considering if there are other possible solutions. Given the constraints, with the prices and the total amount spent, and the total number of items, it seems that buying 10 of each type is the only solution that satisfies both equations.\n\nIf we wanted to, we could also think about this problem in terms of weighted averages. The average price per candy bar is total cost divided by total number: 35.00 / 20 = 1.75 per candy bar.\n\nSince type X is $1.50 and type Y is $2.00, the average price of $1.75 is right in the middle, which again suggests that the customer bought an equal number of each type, which aligns with our solution.\n\nOverall, the answer is that the customer bought 10 candy bars of type X and 10 candy bars of type Y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ candy bars of type X and } 10 \\text{ candy bars of type Y}} \\]"
