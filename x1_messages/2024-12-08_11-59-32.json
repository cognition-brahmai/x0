        "content": "Let's see. So there's this scenario where one man is driving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour, and he passes a gas station at exactly noon. Then, another car leaves the same gas station going in the same direction but at a faster constant speed of 60 miles per hour. I need to figure out at what time the second car will catch up to the first one.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how far ahead the first car is by the time the second car starts. Since the first car is going at 40 mph and the second car starts at the same gas station later, but I need to know how much time has passed between the first car passing the gas station and the second car starting.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify when the second car leaves relative to when the first car passes the gas station. It just says \"another car leaves the same gas station traveling in the same direction at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.\" It doesn't mention if it's immediately after the first car passes or after some time has elapsed.\n\nI think I need to assume that the second car starts leaving the gas station at some time after the first car has passed. But without specifying that time, I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe I need to consider the time difference as a variable.\n\nLet me try to set up some variables. Let's say the second car leaves the gas station t hours after the first car passes it. So, by the time the second car starts, the first car has already been traveling for t hours at 40 mph. Therefore, the first car is ahead by a distance of 40 * t miles.\n\nNow, the second car is going faster at 60 mph, so it's gaining on the first car. The relative speed between the second car and the first car is 60 - 40 = 20 mph. That means the second car is closing the gap by 20 miles every hour.\n\nSo, the time it takes for the second car to catch up to the first car can be found by dividing the initial distance between them by the relative speed. So, time to catch up = (40 * t) / 20 = 2 * t hours.\n\nBut wait, this doesn't make complete sense because if t is the time between the first car passing and the second car starting, and then the second car takes another 2*t hours to catch up, that would mean the total time from noon to when the second car catches up is t + 2*t = 3*t hours. But I don't know what t is.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps I should consider the positions of both cars as functions of time and set them equal to find when they meet.\n\nLet's let t be the time in hours after noon when the second car starts. So, the first car has already been traveling for t hours at 40 mph by the time the second car starts.\n\nTherefore, the position of the first car at time t after noon is:\n\nPosition1 = 40 * t miles.\n\nNow, the second car starts at time t after noon and travels at 60 mph. So, its position relative to the gas station starting from time t is:\n\nPosition2 = 60 * (time since it started).\n\nBut to make this consistent, I need to express both positions as functions of the same variable. Maybe I should let t be the time after the second car starts.\n\nLet me try that. Let t be the time in hours after the second car starts.\n\nThen:\n\nPosition1 = 40 * (t + t_start), where t_start is the time between the first car passing and the second car starting. But this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I should let t be the time after noon, and have both positions as functions of t.\n\nSo, for the first car:\n\nPosition1 = 40 * t miles, since it starts at noon.\n\nFor the second car, if it starts at time t = t_start after noon, then:\n\nPosition2 = 60 * (t - t_start) for t >= t_start.\n\nNow, to find when Position1 = Position2:\n\n40 * t = 60 * (t - t_start)\n\nLet's solve for t:\n\n40t = 60t - 60 t_start\n\nSubtract 40t from both sides:\n\n0 = 20t - 60 t_start\n\nSo, 20t = 60 t_start\n\nTherefore, t = 3 t_start\n\nSo, the first car is caught up at time t = 3 t_start after noon.\n\nBut I still don't know t_start; it's not specified in the problem.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the problem. Let me look back.\n\n\"A man is driving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. He passes a gas station at exactly noon. Another car leaves the same gas station traveling in the same direction at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. At what time will the second car catch up to the first car?\"\n\nHmm, it seems I misinterpreted it earlier. It says \"another car leaves the same gas station traveling in the same direction at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.\" It doesn't specify when the second car leaves relative to when the first car passes. It might be implied that the second car leaves immediately after the first car passes, or at some other time.\n\nBut to proceed, perhaps I should assume that the second car leaves immediately at noon as well, but that doesn't make sense because the first car has already passed the gas station at noon. So, maybe the second car leaves at noon, but the first car has already started before noon.\n\nWait, the first sentence says \"a man is driving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. He passes a gas station at exactly noon.\" So, the first car is already moving, passes the gas station at noon, and then the second car leaves the same gas station traveling in the same direction at 60 mph.\n\nSo, the second car leaves the gas station at some time after noon, but it's not specified. This is confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to assume that the second car leaves the gas station immediately at noon, but the first car has already passed it at that time. So, the first car is already ahead.\n\nWait, but if the second car leaves at noon, and the first car passes the gas station at exactly noon, then at noon, the first car is just passing the gas station, so it's at the gas station location at noon, and the second car starts from the same point at noon.\n\nSo, at noon, both cars are at the gas station, but the first car has just passed it. So, perhaps at noon, the first car is right at the gas station, and the second car starts from there as well.\n\nBut that seems ambiguous. Maybe I should consider that the first car is passing the gas station at noon, meaning it's just there at that instant, and the second car starts from the gas station at some other time.\n\nThis is tricky. Perhaps I need to consider the second car starting at a later time after noon.\n\nLet me try assigning variables differently.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after noon when the second car starts.\n\nSo, the first car has been traveling for t hours by the time the second car starts.\n\nTherefore, the first car is ahead by 40 * t miles.\n\nNow, the second car travels at 60 mph, so its speed relative to the first car is 60 - 40 = 20 mph.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the second car to catch up is (40 * t) / 20 = 2t hours.\n\nSo, the second car catches up 2t hours after it starts.\n\nBut the total time after noon when this happens is t + 2t = 3t hours.\n\nThis seems circular because I have t in terms of itself.\n\nMaybe I need to set up equations more carefully.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet t be the time in hours after noon when the second car starts.\n\nThen, the first car has been traveling for t hours at 40 mph, so it's 40t miles ahead.\n\nThe second car travels at 60 mph, so the relative speed is 20 mph.\n\nTime to catch up: distance / relative speed = (40t) / 20 = 2t hours.\n\nBut the second car starts at time t after noon, so the total time after noon when it catches up is t + 2t = 3t hours.\n\nWait, but I have 3t as the total time, but I don't know t.\n\nThis seems like I have one equation with one variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to express t in terms of known quantities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should let t be the time after noon when the catch up occurs.\n\nThen, the first car has been traveling for t hours, covering 40t miles.\n\nThe second car has been traveling for (t - t_start) hours, where t_start is the time between noon and when the second car starts.\n\nBut t_start is not given.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the second car starts at a specific time after noon, but since it's not specified, I can't solve the problem as it stands.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second car starts immediately at noon, but the first car has already passed the gas station at that time.\n\nWait, if the first car passes the gas station at exactly noon, and the second car leaves the same gas station at the same time, but the first car is already moving, then the second car is starting from the same point at the same time but going faster.\n\nWait, but if they both start from the same point at the same time, but the second car is going faster, it should catch up to the first car at some point.\n\nBut in this case, since the second car is faster, it should catch up to the first car eventually.\n\nWait, but if they both start at the same time, from the same point, and the second car is faster, then the second car will immediately be ahead of the first car, unless they are at the same point.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose the first car passes the gas station at noon, meaning at noon, it is at the gas station and continues moving at 40 mph.\n\nThe second car leaves the same gas station at the same time, noon, traveling in the same direction at 60 mph.\n\nSo, at noon, both cars are at the gas station, but the second car starts moving at 60 mph, while the first car has already started moving at 40 mph.\n\nWait, but if both cars start from the gas station at noon, but the first car has already passed it at noon, which doesn't make sense because \"passing\" implies it's just there at that instant.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to clarify the problem statement.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"A man is driving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. He passes a gas station at exactly noon. Another car leaves the same gas station traveling in the same direction at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. At what time will the second car catch up to the first car?\"\n\nSo, the first car is already in motion, passes the gas station at noon, and the second car leaves the gas station at the same time, noon, going in the same direction but faster.\n\nWait, but if the second car leaves at noon, and the first car has just passed the gas station at noon, then at noon, the first car is right at the gas station, and the second car starts from there as well.\n\nBut if both are at the same point at noon, and the second car is faster, it should catch up to the first car immediately, but since they are both at the same point at noon, they are already together.\n\nThis can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first car passes the gas station at noon, meaning it's just there at that instant, and the second car starts from the gas station at the same time, going faster.\n\nIn this case, the second car is starting from the same point as the first car at noon, but since it's going faster, it will eventually catch up.\n\nWait, but if they start from the same point at the same time, and the second car is faster, it will always be ahead of the first car.\n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nI must be misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nCar A is moving at 40 mph and passes a gas station at noon.\n\nCar B starts from the same gas station at noon, moving at 60 mph in the same direction.\n\nWhen will Car B catch up to Car A?\n\nBut if both start from the same point at the same time, and Car B is faster, Car B is already ahead of Car A.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that Car A has a head start because it passes the gas station at noon, but Car B starts from the gas station at noon as well.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Car A passes the gas station at noon and continues moving, and Car B starts from the gas station at a different time, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nMaybe the problem is that Car A passes the gas station at noon, meaning it's just there at that instant, and Car B starts from the gas station at the same time, going faster.\n\nIn this case, since Car B is faster, it will catch up to Car A sometime after noon.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nAt noon:\n\n- Car A is at the gas station and starts moving at 40 mph.\n\n- Car B starts from the gas station at 60 mph.\n\nWait, but if both start at noon, and Car B is faster, it will always be ahead of Car A.\n\nUnless Car A had a head start.\n\nBut the problem says \"passes the gas station at exactly noon,\" which might imply that Car A is just there at noon, and Car B starts at the same time.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that Car A is already moving before noon and just passes the gas station at noon, while Car B starts from the gas station at noon.\n\nIn this case, at noon, Car A is at the gas station and continues moving, and Car B starts from the same point.\n\nSo, at time t after noon:\n\n- Car A has traveled 40 * t miles.\n\n- Car B has traveled 60 * (t - t_start) miles, where t_start is the time Car B starts after noon.\n\nBut the problem says Car B leaves the gas station at noon, so t_start = 0.\n\nThus, Car B has traveled 60 * t miles.\n\nBut in this case, Car B is always ahead of Car A, which doesn't make sense for catching up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Car A passes the gas station at noon and continues moving, and Car B starts from the gas station at a later time.\n\nBut the problem says \"another car leaves the same gas station traveling in the same direction at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify when Car B leaves relative to when Car A passes the gas station.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that Car A passes the gas station at noon, and Car B leaves the gas station at some later time, but it's not specified.\n\nIn that case, I can't determine the exact time when Car B catches up to Car A without knowing when Car B starts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intends for Car B to leave the gas station at noon, and Car A has passed the gas station at noon, so they are both at the gas station at noon, and Car B starts moving at 60 mph while Car A is moving at 40 mph.\n\nIn this scenario, Car B is faster and will catch up to Car A.\n\nLet me try to calculate that.\n\nAt time t hours after noon:\n\n- Car A has traveled 40 * t miles.\n\n- Car B has traveled 60 * t miles.\n\nBut since they both start from the same point, the one who is faster will be ahead.\n\nIn this case, Car B is faster, so it will be ahead of Car A.\n\nWait, but the question is \"at what time will the second car catch up to the first car?\"\n\nIf Car B is faster, it's not catching up; it's already ahead.\n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nLet me try to think of it differently.\n\nSuppose Car A passes the gas station at noon, meaning at noon, Car A is at the gas station and continues moving at 40 mph.\n\nCar B leaves the gas station at noon, traveling at 60 mph in the same direction.\n\nSo, at noon:\n\n- Car A is at the gas station and starts moving at 40 mph.\n\n- Car B is at the gas station and starts moving at 60 mph.\n\nIn this case, Car B is faster and will leave Car A behind.\n\nTherefore, Car B won't be catching up to Car A; it will be moving ahead.\n\nThis contradicts the question's premise of Car B catching up to Car A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Car A passes the gas station at noon and continues moving, and Car B leaves the gas station at a later time, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I think the problem might have a typo or missing information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Car A is approaching the gas station and passes it at noon, while Car B leaves the gas station at noon.\n\nBut even then, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll try to make an assumption to proceed.\n\nAssumption: Car A passes the gas station at noon, meaning it's at the gas station at noon and continues moving at 40 mph.\n\nCar B leaves the gas station at a later time, say t hours after noon, traveling at 60 mph.\n\nGoal: Find the time when Car B catches up to Car A.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- t = time in hours after noon when Car B starts.\n\n- At time t after noon, Car A has traveled 40 * t miles.\n\n- Car B starts at time t after noon and travels at 60 mph.\n\n- The time it takes for Car B to catch up to Car A is the time when the distance traveled by Car B equals the distance traveled by Car A.\n\nBut Car A has a head start of 40 * t miles.\n\nThe relative speed is 60 - 40 = 20 mph.\n\nTime to catch up = (head start distance) / (relative speed) = (40 * t) / 20 = 2 * t hours.\n\nSo, Car B catches up 2 * t hours after it starts.\n\nBut Car B starts at time t after noon, so the total time after noon when Car B catches up is t + 2 * t = 3 * t hours.\n\nThis seems circular; I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s let t be the time after noon when Car B catches up to Car A.\n\nThen:\n\n- Car A has been traveling for t hours, covering 40 * t miles.\n\n- Car B has been traveling for (t - t_start) hours, where t_start is the time between noon and when Car B starts.\n\n- The distance covered by Car B is 60 * (t - t_start) miles.\n\nSet the distances equal:\n\n40 * t = 60 * (t - t_start)\n\nSolve for t:\n\n40t = 60t - 60t_start\n\nSubtract 40t from both sides:\n\n0 = 20t - 60t_start\n\nSo, 20t = 60t_start\n\nTherefore, t = 3 t_start\n\nSo, the time when Car B catches up is 3 times the starting delay of Car B after noon.\n\nBut t_start is not given, so I can't find a numerical value for t.\n\nThis suggests that without knowing when Car B starts after noon, I can't determine the exact time it catches up to Car A.\n\nTherefore, the problem as stated doesn't provide enough information to find a unique solution.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second car leaves the gas station immediately after the first car passes, but not exactly at noon.\n\nBut without specifying the exact time difference, I can't compute the catch-up time.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I think the problem needs more information to be solvable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second car leaves the gas station at noon, and the first car has already passed it at that time, but they will be traveling in the same direction.\n\nIn this case, if the second car is faster, it will catch up to the first car at some point.\n\nBut as per my earlier calculations, if both start at noon, with Car B starting from the gas station and Car A having just passed it, then Car B will catch up based on the relative speeds.\n\nHowever, if both start at noon from the same point, and Car B is faster, it will immediately be ahead of Car A, which contradicts the idea of catching up.\n\nThis suggests a need for clarification in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll make an assumption to proceed.\n\nAssumption: Car A passes the gas station at noon and continues moving at 40 mph. Car B leaves the gas station at noon, traveling at 60 mph in the same direction.\n\nFind: At what time will Car B catch up to Car A?\n\nUnder this assumption:\n\nAt noon:\n\n- Car A is at the gas station and starts moving at 40 mph.\n\n- Car B is at the gas station and starts moving at 60 mph.\n\nSo, Car B is faster and will leave Car A behind.\n\nThis doesn't make sense for Car B to catch up to Car A; instead, Car B will be ahead.\n\nTherefore, my assumption must be wrong.\n\nAlternative assumption: Car A passes the gas station at noon, meaning it's just there at that instant, and Car B leaves the gas station at a later time, say t hours after noon.\n\nThen, Car A has a head start of t hours * 40 mph.\n\nCar B travels at 60 mph, so the relative speed is 20 mph.\n\nTime to catch up: (40 * t) / 20 = 2t hours.\n\nSo, Car B catches up 2t hours after it starts.\n\nBut Car B starts t hours after noon, so the total time after noon is t + 2t = 3t hours.\n\nBut I have t in terms of itself; this doesn't help.\n\nThis suggests that without knowing the specific time delay between Car A passing and Car B starting, I can't find a numerical answer.\n\nTherefore, the problem likely has missing information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that Car B leaves the gas station at noon, and Car A has already passed it at that time, but I need more details.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the problem needs to specify when Car B leaves the gas station relative to when Car A passes it.\n\nWithout that information, it's impossible to determine the catch-up time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The problem requires specification of the time delay between Car A passing the gas station and Car B starting to determine the catch-up time.}} \\]"
