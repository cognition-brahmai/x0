        "content": "The sport you're referring to is cricket. It's a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the center of which is a 22-yard (20-meter) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player from the fielding team, called the bowler, \"bowls\" the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, which is guarded by a player from the batting team called the batsman. The batsman defends the wicket from being hit by the ball and attempts to score runs by hitting the ball with the bat and running between the wickets. The bowler, through skilful delivery of the ball, attempts to dismiss the batsman. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, both of whom are required to make decisions on most aspects of the game, in particular when a batsman is dismissed. There are several formats of cricket, including Test matches, one-day internationals, and Twenty20 matches, each with their own rules and durations."
