        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to make this Java Swing GUI application where users can draw basic shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines on a canvas. They should be able to do this by using mouse clicks and drags. Also, there should be buttons to change the color of the shapes and to clear the canvas.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic Java Swing application. I'll need a JFrame to hold everything. Inside the JFrame, I'll need a drawing area where the shapes will be drawn, and some buttons for color selection and clearing the canvas.\n\nSo, I'll create a new class, say, DrawingApplication, which extends JFrame. In the constructor, I'll set up the GUI components.\n\nLet me think about the drawing area. I think I'll need a JPanel where the painting happens. I can override the paintComponent method in this panel to draw the shapes.\n\nNow, for handling mouse interactions, I need to add a MouseListener and a MouseMotionListener to the drawing panel. This way, I can capture mouse clicks and drags.\n\nI'll need to keep track of the starting and ending points for each shape. For example, when the user clicks and drags the mouse, I'll record the coordinates where the mouse is pressed and where it's released.\n\nDepending on the shape selected (rectangle, circle, line), I'll draw the corresponding shape between these two points.\n\nI should also provide a way for the user to select which shape they want to draw. Maybe I'll add some radio buttons for shape selection.\n\nAnd there should be color buttons to change the color of the shapes. Perhaps I'll have a few buttons for different colors, and when a user clicks on a color button, the shapes drawn afterward will be in that color.\n\nAlso, a clear canvas button to erase everything drawn so far.\n\nLet me sketch out the components I need:\n\n- JFrame: main window\n\n- JPanel: drawing area, with mouse listeners for drawing shapes\n\n- JRadioButton: for shape selection (rectangle, circle, line)\n\n- JButtons: for color selection and clear canvas\n\nI need to organize these components. Maybe I'll use a BorderLayout for the JFrame, with the drawing panel in the CENTER and the buttons and radio buttons in the NORTH or SOUTH.\n\nFor the color buttons, I can have a button for each color, like red, blue, green, etc. Each button will set the current drawing color when clicked.\n\nThe clear canvas button will simply clear the drawing panel.\n\nI should also think about how to store the drawn shapes. Maybe I'll keep a list of shapes, each with their type, coordinates, and color. Then, in the painting method, I'll iterate through this list and draw each shape.\n\nLet me define a Shape interface with a draw method that takes a Graphics object. Then, I'll have concrete classes for RectangleShape, CircleShape, and LineShape, each implementing the draw method.\n\nThis way, I can add shapes to a list as the user draws, and in paintComponent, loop through the list and call draw on each shape.\n\nI need to handle mouse events:\n\n- Mouse pressed: record the starting point\n\n- Mouse released: record the ending point and add the shape to the list based on the selected shape type\n\nI should also think about how to handle mouse dragging, maybe to provide visual feedback while dragging.\n\nWait, maybe I can draw a temporary shape while the mouse is being dragged, and then finalize it when the mouse is released.\n\nThis might make the drawing more intuitive.\n\nSo, in mouse dragged, I can repaint the panel with the temporary shape, and in mouse released, I can add the permanent shape to the list.\n\nI need to have a variable to keep track of the current shape being drawn, and another list to hold all the completed shapes.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. User selects a shape type using radio buttons.\n\n2. User selects a color using color buttons.\n\n3. User clicks and drags on the drawing panel.\n\n4. While dragging, a temporary shape is drawn on the panel.\n\n5. When the user releases the mouse, the temporary shape becomes permanent and is added to the list of shapes.\n\n6. The drawing panel paints all the shapes in the list, using their respective colors.\n\n7. The clear button removes all shapes from the list and repaints the panel.\n\nI need to make sure that only one shape is being drawn at a time, i.e., the user can't start drawing a new shape before finishing the previous one.\n\nWait, but maybe I want to allow the user to draw multiple shapes by clicking and dragging multiple times.\n\nIn that case, I need to capture each start and end point pair and store them as separate shapes.\n\nSo, I'll need to keep track of the start and end points for each shape, and store them in the list.\n\nI should also consider adding some error checking, like making sure that the start and end points are different before adding the shape.\n\nFor the circle, I need to calculate the width and height based on the start and end points, making sure it's a circle, not an ellipse.\n\nWait, but circles can be ellipses if the aspect ratio isn't 1:1. Maybe I'll allow that and just draw ellipses.\n\nOr maybe I'll constrain the circle to be perfectly round, by adjusting the width and height to be equal.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'll allow ellipses for circles, as it's more flexible.\n\nFor the line, I'll just draw a straight line between the start and end points.\n\nFor the rectangle, I'll draw a rectangle from the start to end points.\n\nI need to make sure that the coordinates are handled correctly, considering which point is the top-left and which is the bottom-right.\n\nI should also think about negative widths and heights, but in Java Graphics, you can specify negative widths and heights, and it will adjust the drawing accordingly.\n\nBut to make it simpler, maybe I'll calculate the width and height as the absolute difference between x coordinates and y coordinates, and then adjust the position accordingly.\n\nLet me try to write some pseudocode for the mouse events:\n\nIn mousePressed:\n\nrecord the start point (x1, y1)\n\nIn mouseDragged:\n\nrecord the end point (x2, y2)\n\nrepaint the panel to draw the temporary shape based on (x1, y1, x2, y2)\n\nIn mouseReleased:\n\nadd the shape to the list using (x1, y1, x2, y2, shapeType, color)\n\nrepaint the panel to draw all shapes, including the new one\n\nI need to make sure that the temporary shape is only drawn during dragging and doesn't persist after release.\n\nSo, in paintComponent, I'll draw all the shapes in the list, and if there's a temporary shape, draw that on top.\n\nI should have a variable to hold the temporary shape, and set it to null when the drawing is finished.\n\nLet me define a ShapeType enum with values RECTANGLE, CIRCLE, LINE.\n\nAnd have a variable to hold the currentShapeType based on the selected radio button.\n\nSimilarly, have a variable currentColor to hold the selected color.\n\nFor the color buttons, I'll create JButtons with colored backgrounds, and when clicked, set the currentColor to that color.\n\nI should also think about the initial values. Maybe set rectangle as the default shape and black as the default color.\n\nI need to make sure that the drawing panel respects the currentColor and currentShapeType when drawing the shapes.\n\nI should also consider adding a way to select which shape to draw, maybe with a button group for the radio buttons.\n\nLet me think about the layout. I'll use a BorderLayout for the JFrame, with the drawing panel in the CENTER.\n\nIn the SOUTH, I'll have a panel with the shape selection radio buttons.\n\nIn the NORTH, I'll have a panel with the color buttons and the clear button.\n\nSo, something like:\n\nJFrame:\n\n- BorderLayout\n\n- CENTER: DrawingPanel (JPanel)\n\n- NORTH: JPanel with color buttons and clear button\n\n- SOUTH: JPanel with shape radio buttons\n\nI need to organize the components accordingly.\n\nI should also think about the size of the drawing panel. Maybe set it to a fixed size, or make it resizable.\n\nProbably better to make it resizable, so that it adjusts to the frame size.\n\nI need to override the paintComponent method in DrawingPanel, and use Graphics object to draw the shapes.\n\nRemember to call super.paintComponent(g) first to clear the background.\n\nI should also handle the temporary shape in paintComponent, by drawing it if it exists.\n\nLet me think about the data structure for shapes.\n\nI'll have an interface Shape:\n\n- void draw(Graphics g)\n\nThen, concrete classes for each shape type:\n\nRectangleShape implements Shape:\n\n- constructor: x, y, width, height, color\n\n- draw: g.setColor(color); g.drawRect(x, y, width, height)\n\nCircleShape implements Shape:\n\n- constructor: x, y, width, height, color\n\n- draw: g.setColor(color); g.drawOval(x, y, width, height)\n\nLineShape implements Shape:\n\n- constructor: x1, y1, x2, y2, color\n\n- draw: g.setColor(color); g.drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n\nIn the DrawingPanel, I'll have a list of Shape: List<Shape> shapes\n\nAnd a temporary Shape variable for the shape being drawn.\n\nIn paintComponent, I'll iterate through the shapes list and call draw on each, then draw the temporary shape if it exists.\n\nFor the mouse events, I'll have:\n\n- mousePressed: record start point, set temporary shape based on currentShapeType and currentColor\n\n- mouseDragged: record end point, repaint to show temporary shape\n\n- mouseReleased: add temporary shape to shapes list, set temporary shape to null\n\nI need to make sure that only one temporary shape exists at a time, corresponding to the current drawing action.\n\nI should also think about what happens if the user clicks without dragging. Maybe consider it as a zero-size shape and ignore it.\n\nOr for line, maybe draw a point.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to require both press and drag for drawing.\n\nI need to decide.\n\nAlso, for the color buttons, I'll create buttons with colored backgrounds using setBackgound(color), and add ActionListener to set currentColor when clicked.\n\nSimilarly, for the shape radio buttons, I'll use a ButtonGroup to ensure only one is selected at a time.\n\nFor the clear button, I'll add an ActionListener to clear the shapes list and repaint the drawing panel.\n\nI should also think about how to organize the code. Maybe have the DrawingPanel as an inner class of the main JFrame class, or as a separate class.\n\nProbably better to have it as a separate class for clarity.\n\nSo, in summary, here's the plan:\n\n1. Create a JFrame named DrawingApplication.\n\n2. Set up the GUI with BorderLayout:\n\n- CENTER: DrawingPanel (a separate class extending JPanel)\n\n- NORTH: JPanel containing color selection buttons and a clear button\n\n- SOUTH: JPanel containing shape selection radio buttons\n\n3. In DrawingPanel:\n\n- Override paintComponent to draw all shapes and the temporary shape.\n\n- Implement MouseListener and MouseMotionListener to handle mouse events for drawing.\n\n- Maintain a list of Shape objects and a temporary Shape for the current drawing action.\n\n4. Define Shape interface with draw method, and concrete classes for each shape type.\n\n5. Manage state variables for currentShapeType, currentColor.\n\n6. Implement action listeners for color buttons, shape radio buttons, and clear button.\n\nNow, I'll start implementing this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll create the main class DrawingApplication extending JFrame.\n\nThen, I'll create the DrawingPanel class extending JPanel.\n\nIn DrawingPanel, I'll handle the mouse events and painting.\n\nDefine the Shape interface and concrete shape classes.\n\nSet up the GUI components in DrawingApplication.\n\nImplement the action listeners for buttons.\n\nFinally, put it all together and test.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nI might run into some issues with mouse coordinates and shape calculations, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nLet me start coding.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java Swing GUI application that allows users to draw basic shapes (rectangle, circle, line) on a canvas using mouse clicks and drags, along with buttons to change the color and clear the canvas, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Main Application Frame**: \n   - Extend `JFrame` to create the main application window.\n   - Use `BorderLayout` to organize components.\n\n2. **Drawing Panel**:\n   - Extend `JPanel` to create a drawing area.\n   - Override `paintComponent` to draw shapes.\n   - Implement `MouseListener` and `MouseMotionListener` to handle mouse events for drawing shapes.\n\n3. **Shape Interface and Concrete Shapes**:\n   - Define an interface `Shape` with a `draw` method.\n   - Create concrete classes for `RectangleShape`, `CircleShape`, and `LineShape` implementing the `Shape` interface.\n\n4. **Color and Shape Selection**:\n   - Use `JButton`s for color selection.\n   - Use `JRadioButton`s for shape selection managed by a `ButtonGroup`.\n\n5. **Clear Canvas**:\n   - Use a `JButton` to clear the canvas.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.*;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class DrawingApplication extends JFrame {\n    private DrawingPanel drawingPanel;\n    private ButtonGroup shapeGroup;\n    private Color currentColor = Color.BLACK;\n\n    public DrawingApplication() {\n        initComponents();\n    }\n\n    private void initComponents() {\n        setTitle(\"Drawing Application\");\n        setSize(800, 600);\n        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        setLayout(new BorderLayout());\n\n        drawingPanel = new DrawingPanel();\n        add(drawingPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);\n\n        // Shape selection panel\n        JPanel shapePanel = new JPanel();\n        shapeGroup = new ButtonGroup();\n        String[] shapeLabels = {\"Rectangle\", \"Circle\", \"Line\"};\n        for (String label : shapeLabels) {\n            JRadioButton btn = new JRadioButton(label);\n            btn.setActionCommand(label);\n            btn.addActionListener(e -> drawingPanel.setShapeType(label));\n            shapeGroup.add(btn);\n            shapePanel.add(btn);\n        }\n        add(shapePanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);\n\n        // Color selection and clear panel\n        JPanel colorPanel = new JPanel();\n        String[] colorLabels = {\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", \"Black\"};\n        Color[] colors = {Color.RED, Color.GREEN, Color.BLUE, Color.BLACK};\n        for (int i = 0;
