        "content": "The 16th president of the United States was Abraham Lincoln. He served from March 4, 1861, until his assassination on April 15, 1865. Lincoln is renowned for his leadership during the American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, and for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were to be set free.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a one-room log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky. He had limited formal education but was largely self-taught and became a lawyer and politician. Lincoln was a member of the Whig Party before joining the Republican Party, which he helped create.\n\nIn 1860, Lincoln was elected as the first Republican president. His presidency coincided with the secession of several Southern states, which formed the Confederate States of America, leading to the outbreak of the Civil War. Lincoln's primary goal was to preserve the Union, and he issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, as a strategic move to weaken the Confederacy by freeing its enslaved workforce.\n\nLincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863, in which he redefined the purpose of the war, declaring that it was not only about preserving the Union but also about ensuring that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\n\nHe was re-elected in 1864 and began planning for the reconstruction of the nation. However, on April 14, 1865, just days after the Confederacy's defeat, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. His assassination was part of a larger conspiracy that also targeted Secretary of State William H. Seward and Vice President Andrew Johnson, though only Lincoln died.\n\nAbraham Lincoln is widely regarded as one of the greatest presidents in U.S. history for his roles in preserving the Union and beginning the process that led to the abolition of slavery. His leadership during one of the nation's greatest crises and his commitment to the principles of democracy and equality have made him an enduring symbol of American ideals."
