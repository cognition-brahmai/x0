He fills all of them with chocolate chip cookies, and then he removes 5 cookies from one tray. After that, he wants to add some oatmeal cookies to have an equal number of both types. We need to find out how many oatmeal cookies he must add.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many chocolate chip cookies there are initially. Since there are 3 trays and each holds 12 cookies, the total number of chocolate chip cookies is:\n\n3 trays * 12 cookies/tray = 36 cookies\n\nNow, the baker removes 5 cookies from one tray. So, the number of chocolate chip cookies now is:\n\n36 cookies - 5 cookies = 31 cookies\n\nAlright, so now there are 31 chocolate chip cookies. The baker wants to add oatmeal cookies to have an equal number of both types. That means the number of oatmeal cookies should be equal to the number of chocolate chip cookies, which is 31.\n\nBut wait, he's starting with zero oatmeal cookies and needs to add some to make it equal to 31. So, he needs to add 31 oatmeal cookies.\n\nLet me just double-check that. Initially, there are 36 chocolate chip cookies. Removes 5, so 31 chocolate chip cookies. Then, to have equal numbers, he needs 31 oatmeal cookies. So, he needs to add 31 oatmeal cookies.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
