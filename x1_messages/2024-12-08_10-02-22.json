        "content": "I've got this task to create a C# application that reads integers from a text file, calculates the sum and average for each line, and then writes those results to a new file. It should also use command line arguments for the file paths and handle exceptions properly. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a new C# console application. I can do this using Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports C#. Once the project is created, I'll need to write the code that handles the command line arguments, reads from the input file, processes the data, and writes to the output file.\n\nLet's think about the command line arguments. The user will provide the input file path and the output file path. So, in the Main method, I need to check the args array for these parameters. Typically, args[0] will be the input file path, and args[1] will be the output file path.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like if the user doesn't provide enough arguments or if the file paths are invalid. For that, I'll need to add some validation and exception handling.\n\nNow, for reading the input file. Each line contains space-separated integers. So, I'll need to read the file line by line, split each line by spaces, convert the strings to integers, and then calculate the sum and average of those integers.\n\nIn C#, I can use the System.IO namespace to handle file operations. The File class has a ReadAllLines method that can read all lines from a file into a string array. That sounds perfect for this task.\n\nOnce I have the array of lines, I can iterate through each line, split it by spaces, and convert the split strings to integers. I'll need to handle any potential FormatExceptions if the strings aren't valid integers.\n\nAfter converting the strings to integers, I can calculate the sum by adding them up and the average by dividing the sum by the number of integers in the line.\n\nThen, I need to write the results to the output file. For each line in the input file, I'll write the sum and average to the output file, probably in a formatted string.\n\nAgain, I need to handle any exceptions that might occur during file writing, such as insufficient permissions or if the output file is already open in another program.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Check if the correct number of command line arguments are provided. If not, display an error message and exit.\n\n2. Attempt to read all lines from the input file using File.ReadAllLines.\n\n3. For each line:\n\na. Split the line by spaces.\n\nb. Convert the split strings to integers.\n\nc. Calculate the sum and average.\n\nd. Store the results.\n\n4. Write the results to the output file.\n\nThroughout this process, I need to handle exceptions like FileNotFoundException, DirectoryNotFoundException, IOException, etc., and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the input file might contain empty lines or lines with non-integer values. In such cases, I need to handle those gracefully without crashing the application.\n\nMaybe I can skip lines that don't contain valid integers or handle them by writing an error message to the output file for those lines.\n\nLet me think about the data types. For sum, since we're dealing with integers, I can use int or long depending on the possible sum values. For average, since it's a division, it should be a floating-point number, so I'll use double.\n\nI should also consider the case where a line has only one integer. The sum would be the integer itself, and the average would also be the same.\n\nAnother consideration is that if a line has no integers (perhaps just spaces or empty), I should probably handle that by not calculating sum and average or perhaps writing a specific message for such lines.\n\nI need to decide on the format of the output file. Maybe each line should contain the original line's data followed by the sum and average, like:\n\nOriginal data: 1 2 3\n\nSum: 6, Average: 2\n\nOr perhaps a more compact format:\n\n1 2 3, Sum: 6, Average: 2\n\nI'll need to decide based on what's most appropriate or if there are any specific requirements.\n\nSince the prompt doesn't specify the output format, I'll choose a simple and clear format, like:\n\nSum: X, Average: Y\n\non each line corresponding to the input lines.\n\nNow, let's consider how to handle exceptions during integer conversion. If a line contains non-integer values, I can catch the FormatException and perhaps write an error message to the output file for that line, indicating that the data is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if there are issues with file access, I should catch the corresponding exceptions and inform the user about the problem.\n\nLet me sketch a rough code structure:\n\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n\n{\n\nif (args.Length != 2)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Usage: Program.exe inputfile outputfile\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nstring inputPath = args[0];\n\nstring outputPath = args[1];\n\ntry\n\n{\n\nstring[] lines = File.ReadAllLines(inputPath);\n\nusing (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(outputPath))\n\n{\n\nforeach (string line in lines)\n\n{\n\ntry\n\n{\n\nstring[] parts = line.Split(' ');\n\nList<int> numbers = new List<int>();\n\nforeach (string part in parts)\n\n{\n\nif (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(part))\n\n{\n\ntry\n\n{\n\nnumbers.Add(int.Parse(part));\n\n}\n\ncatch (FormatException)\n\n{\n\n// Handle invalid integer format\n\nwriter.WriteLine(\"Invalid data: {0}\", line);\n\ncontinue;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif (numbers.Count > 0)\n\n{\n\nint sum = numbers.Sum();\n\ndouble average = (double)sum / numbers.Count;\n\nwriter.WriteLine(\"Sum: {0}, Average: {1}\", sum, average);\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nwriter.WriteLine(\"No valid integers in line: {0}\", line);\n\n}\n\n}\n\ncatch (Exception ex)\n\n{\n\nwriter.WriteLine(\"Error processing line: {0}, Error: {1}\", line, ex.Message);\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\ncatch (Exception ex)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Error: {0}\", ex.Message);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. I'm using System.IO for file operations and System.Linq for the Sum method on the list of integers.\n\nI should make sure to include the necessary using directives at the top of the file:\n\nusing System;\n\nusing System.IO;\n\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nusing System.Linq;\n\nAlso, I need to handle cases where the input file doesn't exist or the output file can't be created. The File.ReadAllLines method will throw a FileNotFoundException if the input file doesn't exist, and the StreamWriter constructor will throw an IOException if there's an issue creating or writing to the output file.\n\nIn the catch blocks, I can provide more specific error messages to help the user understand what went wrong.\n\nAdditionally, I can consider adding some logging or verbose output to the console to inform the user about the progress, especially if the files are large.\n\nBut for simplicity, this should suffice.\n\nLet me think about testing this application. I'll need to create a sample input text file with several lines, each containing space-separated integers. For example:\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 5 6\n\n7 8 9\n\nAnd perhaps some edge cases:\n\n10\n\na b c\n\n100 200\n\nAnd an empty line:\n\n[blank line]\n\nThen, run the application from the command line, providing the input and output file paths.\n\nAfter execution, check the output file to ensure that the sums and averages are correctly calculated and that invalid lines are handled appropriately.\n\nI should also test with invalid file paths to ensure that the application handles those exceptions correctly.\n\nOverall, this seems manageable. I need to be careful with exception handling to make sure that the application doesn't crash and provides useful feedback to the user.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a C# console application that reads a text file containing lines of space-separated integers, calculates the sum and average of each line, and writes the results to a new text file. The application should use command line arguments for input and output file paths and handle any potential exceptions.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check Command Line Arguments:** Ensure that exactly two arguments are provided for input and output file paths.\n2. **Read Input File:** Use `File.ReadAllLines` to read all lines from the input file.\n3. **Process Each Line:** For each line, split the line by spaces, convert the split strings to integers, calculate the sum and average, and write the results to the output file.\n4. **Handle Exceptions:** Catch and handle exceptions for file operations and invalid integer formats gracefully.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        if (args.Length != 2)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: Program.exe inputfile outputfile\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        string inputPath = args[0];\n        string outputPath = args[1];\n\n        try\n        {\n            string[] lines = File.ReadAllLines(inputPath);\n\n            using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(outputPath))\n            {\n                foreach (string line in lines)\n                {\n                    try\n                    {\n                        string[] parts = line.Split(' ');\n                        List<int> numbers = new List<int>();\n\n                        foreach (string part in parts)\n                        {\n                            if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(part))\n                            {\n                                try\n                                {\n                                    numbers.Add(int.Parse(part));\n                                }\n                                catch (FormatException)\n                                {\n                                    // Handle invalid integer format\n                                    writer.WriteLine(\"Invalid data: {0}\", line);\n                                    continue;\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n\n                        if (numbers.Count > 0)\n                        {\n                            int sum = numbers.Sum();\n                            double average = (double)sum / numbers.Count;\n                            writer.WriteLine(\"Sum: {0}, Average: {1}\", sum, average);\n                        }\n                        else\n                        {\n                            writer.WriteLine(\"No valid integers in line: {0}\", line);\n                        }\n                    }\n                    catch (Exception ex)\n                    {\n                        writer.WriteLine(\"Error processing line: {0}, Error: {1}\", line, ex.Message);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Error: {0}\", ex.Message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Command Line Arguments Check:** The program checks if exactly two arguments are provided. If not, it prints the correct usage and exits.\n2. **Reading the Input File:** It reads all lines from the input file using `File.ReadAllLines`.\n3. **Processing Each Line:** For each line, it splits the line by spaces and attempts to parse each part as an integer. If parsing succeeds, it adds the integer to a list. If parsing fails, it writes an error message to the output file.\n4. **Calculating Sum and Average:** For lines with valid integers, it calculates the sum and average and writes the results to the output file.\n5. **Exception Handling:** The program handles exceptions for file operations and invalid integer formats, writing appropriate error messages to the output file or the console.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program is robust and provides clear feedback in case of errors."
