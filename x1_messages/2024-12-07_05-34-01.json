        "content": "Let's see. So, the original price of the item is $100. The store offers a 20% discount on it, and then adds a 10% sales tax to the discounted price. I need to find out what the final price will be after both of these are applied.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the discount. A 20% discount on $100. Well, 20% of 100 is 20, so the discount is $20. So, subtracting that from the original price, the discounted price would be $100 - $20 = $80.\n\nNow, after the discount, there's a 10% sales tax applied to the discounted price. So, I need to calculate 10% of $80. 10% of 80 is $8. So, adding that sales tax to the discounted price, the final price would be $80 + $8 = $88.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can combine the discount and the tax into a single calculation.\n\nLet's think about it. The discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Then, a 10% sales tax is added to that discounted price. So, perhaps I can calculate 80% of $100, which is $80, and then increase that by 10% for the tax.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to combine these percentages. Like, applying a discount and then a tax. I think I've heard of multiplying percentages or something like that.\n\nLet me try that. If the discount is 20%, that's the same as multiplying the original price by (1 - 0.20) = 0.80. Then, adding a 10% tax to the discounted price would be multiplying the discounted price by (1 + 0.10) = 1.10.\n\nSo, overall, the final price would be the original price multiplied by 0.80 and then by 1.10.\n\nSo, $100 * 0.80 * 1.10.\n\nLet me calculate that: 100 * 0.80 = 80, and then 80 * 1.10 = 88. So, again, $88.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems like the final price is $88.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, maybe the tax is applied before the discount or something like that. But no, the problem says the store offers a 20% discount first, and then adds a 10% sales tax to the discounted price. So, the order is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the overall percentage change. First, a 20% discount, which is a reduction to 80% of the original price, and then a 10% increase on that discounted price.\n\nSo, overall, it's 80% multiplied by 110% of the discounted price.\n\nWait, no. Actually, 10% tax means you're paying an additional 10% on the discounted price, so it's like paying 110% of the discounted price.\n\nSo, again, $80 multiplied by 1.10 equals $88.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the original price. The overall factor is 0.80 (for the discount) multiplied by 1.10 (for the tax), which is 0.88. So, 0.88 times $100 is $88.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion. So, I think $88 is the final price.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility of the tax being applied differently. For example, some places might apply tax before discount, but in this case, the problem specifies that the discount is applied first, followed by the tax.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the sales tax is indeed 10% on the discounted price and not on the original price. The problem says it's added to the discounted price, so it should be 10% of $80, which is $8.\n\nTherefore, adding $8 to $80 gives $88.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Unless there's some other factor or additional costs involved, which the problem doesn't mention, $88 should be the final price.\n\nSo, the final price after applying both the 20% discount and the 10% sales tax to the original $100 item is $88.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]"
