        "content": "To compare the areas of the two pizzas, we need to use the formula for the area of a circle, which is A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the circle. The radius is half of the diameter.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of each pizza:\n\n- Small pizza: diameter = 10 inches, so radius r = 10/2 = 5 inches\n\n- Large pizza: diameter = 16 inches, so radius r = 16/2 = 8 inches\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of each pizza:\n\n- Area of small pizza: A = \u03c0*(5)\u00b2 = 25\u03c0 square inches\n\n- Area of large pizza: A = \u03c0*(8)\u00b2 = 64\u03c0 square inches\n\nTo compare the areas, we can divide the area of the large pizza by the area of the small pizza:\n\n64\u03c0 / 25\u03c0 = 64/25 = 2.56\n\nSo, the large pizza has 2.56 times the area of the small pizza.\n\nNow, let's compare the costs:\n\n- Small pizza: $8\n\n- Large pizza: $14\n\nTo determine which is the better deal, we can calculate the cost per square inch for each pizza.\n\nFirst, find the cost per square inch for the small pizza:\n\nCost per square inch = total cost / area\n\n= $8 / (25\u03c0) \u2248 $8 / 78.54 \u2248 $0.102 per square inch\n\nNow, do the same for the large pizza:\n\nCost per square inch = $14 / (64\u03c0) \u2248 $14 / 201.06 \u2248 $0.0696 per square inch\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Small pizza: $0.102 per square inch\n\n- Large pizza: $0.0696 per square inch\n\nThe large pizza has a lower cost per square inch, meaning it's a better deal in terms of cost efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, considering that the large pizza provides more than twice the area of the small pizza (2.56 times), but costs less than twice as much ($14 vs $8), it further reinforces that the large pizza is a better value.\n\nTherefore, the large pizza is the better deal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The large pizza is the better deal.}} \\]"
