        "content": "Let's see. So, Sarah has twice as many apples as John, and together they have 18 apples. I need to find out how many apples John has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the number of apples each person has. Let's say John has J apples. Since Sarah has twice as many as John, Sarah has 2J apples.\n\nNow, together they have 18 apples, so if I add John's apples and Sarah's apples, it should equal 18. So, J + 2J = 18.\n\nThat simplifies to 3J = 18.\n\nTo find J, I need to divide both sides by 3. So, J = 18 / 3 = 6.\n\nTherefore, John has 6 apples.\n\nWait, let me check that. If John has 6 apples, then Sarah has twice that, which is 12 apples. Together, 6 + 12 equals 18, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, yeah, John has 6 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
