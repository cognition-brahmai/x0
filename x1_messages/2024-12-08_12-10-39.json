        "content": "Let's see. So, in this village, there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. All even-numbered houses have blue doors, and all odd-numbered houses have red doors. I need to find out how many houses have both their neighbors with doors of the same color as their own.\n\nFirst, I should understand the setup. Houses are in a row, I assume, since each house has two neighbors, one on each side, except for the houses at both ends, which have only one neighbor each.\n\nSo, house number 1 has house number 2 as its neighbor. House number 2 has house number 1 and house number 3 as its neighbors, and so on, up to house number 100, which has only house number 99 as its neighbor.\n\nNow, the door colors are based on the house numbers: even numbers have blue doors, odd numbers have red doors.\n\nI need to find houses where both neighbors have the same color door as the house itself.\n\nLet me think about the coloring pattern:\n\n- House 1: odd, red door\n\n- House 2: even, blue door\n\n- House 3: odd, red door\n\n- House 4: even, blue door\n\n- And so on, alternating between red and blue.\n\nSo, the door colors alternate between red and blue as you go from house to house.\n\nNow, for a house to have both neighbors with the same color as its own, let's consider different types of houses.\n\nFirst, consider house number 1:\n\n- It has only one neighbor, house 2, which has a blue door.\n\n- House 1 has a red door.\n\n- So, it only has one neighbor, and that neighbor has a different color door.\n\n- Therefore, house 1 does not satisfy the condition.\n\nSimilarly, house 100:\n\n- Only neighbor is house 99, which has an odd number, so red door.\n\n- House 100 has an even number, so blue door.\n\n- Different colors, so house 100 does not satisfy the condition.\n\nNow, let's consider houses in the middle, with two neighbors.\n\nTake house number 2:\n\n- Neighbors are house 1 (red) and house 3 (red).\n\n- House 2 has a blue door.\n\n- Both neighbors have red doors, which is different from house 2's blue door.\n\n- So, house 2 does not satisfy the condition.\n\nHouse number 3:\n\n- Neighbors are house 2 (blue) and house 4 (blue).\n\n- House 3 has a red door.\n\n- Both neighbors have blue doors, which is different from house 3's red door.\n\n- So, house 3 does not satisfy the condition.\n\nHouse number 4:\n\n- Neighbors are house 3 (red) and house 5 (red).\n\n- House 4 has a blue door.\n\n- Both neighbors have red doors, different from house 4's blue door.\n\n- Doesn't satisfy.\n\nHouse number 5:\n\n- Neighbors are house 4 (blue) and house 6 (blue).\n\n- House 5 has a red door.\n\n- Both neighbors have blue doors, different from house 5's red door.\n\n- Doesn't satisfy.\n\nIt seems like a pattern here. Each house has neighbors with the opposite color door.\n\nWait a minute, because the colors alternate, each house will have neighbors with different color doors.\n\nWait, but in the question, it's asked for houses that have both neighbors with the same color as their own.\n\nBut from the above examples, that's not happening.\n\nIs it possible for any house to have both neighbors with the same color as its own?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nSuppose a house has a red door. Its neighbors would have blue doors, because the colors alternate.\n\nSimilarly, a house with a blue door would have neighbors with red doors.\n\nTherefore, for every house, both neighbors have doors of a different color.\n\nSo, is the answer zero? No houses satisfy the condition?\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the endpoints again.\n\nHouse 1: red door, neighbor house 2: blue door. Doesn't match.\n\nHouse 100: blue door, neighbor house 99: red door. Doesn't match.\n\nAll houses in between have two neighbors with opposite colors.\n\nSo, indeed, no house has both neighbors with the same color as their own.\n\nTherefore, the answer is zero.\n\nBut maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nSuppose there is a house with a red door. For both its neighbors to have red doors as well, those neighbors would also have to be odd-numbered houses, since odd-numbered houses have red doors.\n\nBut in the numbering, houses alternate between odd and even, so neighbors of an odd-numbered house are even-numbered, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, neighbors of an odd-numbered house have blue doors, and neighbors of even-numbered houses have red doors.\n\nThus, in no case do both neighbors have the same color door as the house itself.\n\nHence, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, but maybe there are houses where one neighbor is missing, like at the ends.\n\nHouse 1: only neighbor is house 2, which has a blue door, while house 1 has a red door. Doesn't match.\n\nHouse 100: only neighbor is house 99, which has a red door, while house 100 has a blue door. Doesn't match.\n\nSo, even the end houses don't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is zero houses have both neighbors with doors of the same color as their own.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
