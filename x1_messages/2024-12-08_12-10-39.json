        "content": "So there are 500 students in the school. 60% of them play soccer. To find out how many that is, I need to calculate 60% of 500.\n\nFirst, I'll find 60% of 500.\n\n60% of 500 is calculated as (60/100) * 500.\n\nThat's (0.6) * 500 = 300 students play soccer.\n\nNow, out of these 300 students who play soccer, 40% of them also play basketball.\n\nSo, I need to find 40% of 300 to find out how many play both sports.\n\n40% of 300 is (40/100) * 300.\n\nThat's (0.4) * 300 = 120 students.\n\nTherefore, 120 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
