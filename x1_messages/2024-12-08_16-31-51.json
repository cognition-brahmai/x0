Scott Fitzgerald is the iconic American author known for his novels about the Jazz Age, such as \"The Great Gatsby\" and \"Tender Is the Night.\" His last name, Fitzgerald, is also associated with a type of lettuce known as romaine lettuce, which is sometimes called \"cos\" or \"Fitzgerald\" lettuce. However, it's worth noting that the connection between the author and the lettuce is coincidental, as the lettuce was named after a French monk named Cosmus, whose name was later anglicized to \"Fitzgerald.\""
