        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 6 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls in a bag, making a total of 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick one ball, put it back, and pick another, both balls will be the same color.\n\nFirst, since I'm putting the ball back after the first pick, the two events are independent. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick.\n\nTo find the probability of both balls being the same color, I can consider each color separately and then add those probabilities together.\n\nLet's start with red. The probability of picking a red ball on the first pick is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 6/15. Since I'm putting it back, the probability of picking a red ball on the second pick is also 6/15. So, the probability of both picks being red is (6/15) * (6/15).\n\nSimilarly, for blue balls, the probability of picking a blue ball on the first pick is 4/15, and the same for the second pick, so the probability of both being blue is (4/15) * (4/15).\n\nAnd for green balls, it's 5/15 for each pick, so the probability of both being green is (5/15) * (5/15).\n\nNow, to find the total probability of both balls being the same color, I add up these three probabilities:\n\nP(same color) = P(both red) + P(both blue) + P(both green)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(same color) = (6/15 * 6/15) + (4/15 * 4/15) + (5/15 * 5/15)\n\nLet me calculate each term:\n\nFirst, (6/15)^2 = 36/225\n\nSecond, (4/15)^2 = 16/225\n\nThird, (5/15)^2 = 25/225\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n36/225 + 16/225 + 25/225 = (36 + 16 + 25)/225 = 77/225\n\nSo, the probability that both balls will be the same color is 77/225.\n\nWait a minute, can I simplify that fraction? Let's see.\n\n77 and 225 both divided by... 77 is 7*11, and 225 is 15^2, which is 3^2 * 5^2. No common factors, so 77/225 is already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert it to a decimal to see it differently. 77 divided by 225 is approximately 0.3422, or 34.22%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 34.22% chance that both balls will be the same color.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to verify the answer?\n\nWell, another approach could be to consider the total number of ways to pick two balls with replacement, and the number of favorable outcomes where both are the same color.\n\nTotal number of possible outcomes: since there are 15 balls and I'm picking with replacement, it's 15 * 15 = 225.\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes:\n\n- Both red: 6 * 6 = 36\n\n- Both blue: 4 * 4 = 16\n\n- Both green: 5 * 5 = 25\n\nTotal favorable: 36 + 16 + 25 = 77\n\nTherefore, probability is favorable divided by total: 77/225\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of the second ball matching the first ball's color.\n\nThe first ball can be any color, so its probability is 1. Then, the probability that the second ball matches the first ball's color is the same as the probability of picking a ball of a specific color, depending on what the first ball was.\n\nBut since it's with replacement, the probability of picking the same color again is the same as the initial probability of picking that color.\n\nSo, it's the sum over each color of the probability of picking that color first, multiplied by the probability of picking it again.\n\nWhich is the same as what I did initially.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 77/225 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{77}{225}} \\]"
