        "content": "Let's see. There are originally 8 apples and 6 oranges in the basket. So, the total number of fruits at the start is 8 plus 6, which equals 14 fruits.\n\nJohn takes out 3 apples. So, we need to subtract those 3 apples from the total. That would be 14 minus 3, which is 11 fruits left.\n\nThen, Jane takes out 4 oranges. We should subtract those 4 oranges from the remaining fruits. So, 11 minus 4 equals 7 fruits left in the basket.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, starting with 8 apples and 6 oranges, total 14 fruits. John takes 3 apples, so apples left are 8 minus 3, which is 5 apples. Jane takes 4 oranges, so oranges left are 6 minus 4, which is 2 oranges.\n\nNow, the total fruits left would be the remaining apples plus the remaining oranges, which is 5 plus 2, equaling 7 fruits.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, there are 7 fruits left in the basket.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other types of fruits in the basket. The problem mentions only apples and oranges, so no other fruits to consider.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that John and Jane are taking fruits out of the basket, not putting any in. So, it's just subtraction.\n\nI think that's straightforward. No need to overcomplicate it.\n\nSo, the final answer is 7 fruits left in the basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
