        "content": "So we have a family with two parents and four children, making a total of six people. They want to stand in a row for a photo, but with the condition that the two parents must always be together. We need to find out how many different ways they can arrange themselves under this condition.\n\nFirst, let's consider the condition that the two parents must always be together. This means that wherever one parent is in the row, the other parent must be right next to them. Essentially, we can think of the two parents as a single unit or block that can move around as one.\n\nSo, instead of having six individual people to arrange, we now have five units to arrange: the parents as one block, and the four individual children.\n\nNow, how many ways can we arrange these five units in a row? Well, that's just the number of permutations of five distinct items, which is 5 factorial, or 5!.\n\n5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 different ways to arrange the five units.\n\nHowever, within the parents' block, the two parents can switch places. For example, parent A can be on the left and parent B on the right, or vice versa.\n\nSo, for each of the 120 arrangements of the five units, there are 2 possible arrangements for the parents within their block.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is 120 \u00d7 2 = 240.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me double-check.\n\nWe treated the parents as a single block, which gave us 5! = 120 arrangements, and then multiplied by 2 for the internal arrangement of the parents within their block.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it as treating the two parents as a single entity, which reduces the problem to arranging five entities (the parents' block and the four children). Then, since the parents can switch places within their block, we multiply by 2.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the positions that the parents can occupy. Since they must be together, they can occupy positions 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, or 5 and 6. So, there are 5 possible pairs of positions for the parents.\n\nFor each of these 5 pairs, the parents can arrange themselves in 2 ways (parent A and then parent B, or parent B and then parent A).\n\nThen, the remaining four positions are for the four children, who can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements would be 5 (pairs of positions for parents) \u00d7 2 (arrangements within the parents' pair) \u00d7 24 (arrangements of the children) = 5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 24 = 240.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 240 different ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
