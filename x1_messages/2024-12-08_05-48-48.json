The term comes from the French \"coller,\" which means \"to glue.\" So, in a collage, you're essentially gluing various materials onto a backing to form an artistic composition. This medium allows for a lot of flexibility and can incorporate a wide range of textures and visual elements. Have you ever tried making a collage yourself?"
