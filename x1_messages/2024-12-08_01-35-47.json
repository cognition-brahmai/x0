        "content": "So the restaurant can seat 100 people at once, and on a busy night, they turn over their tables 4 times. To find out how many people they served that night, I need to multiply the number of seats by the number of turnover times.\n\nSo, it's 100 people per seating times 4 turnovers. That should be 100 times 4, which is 400 people.\n\nWait, but does turnover mean that each table is used 4 times during the night? If they have tables that are seated 4 times, and each table seats, say, 4 people, then maybe I need to consider the table count.\n\nHmm, but the question says they can seat 100 people at once. Does that mean they have 100 seats in total, possibly across multiple tables?\n\nIf they have 100 seats and they turn over their tables 4 times, then overall, they would have served 100 times 4, which is 400 people.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. If they seat 100 people per seating and they do this 4 times, then it's 100 people each time, four times, so 400 people in total.\n\nAlternatively, if some people stay longer and tables aren't turned over equally, but the question says they turn over their tables 4 times, so I think it's safe to assume that overall, they manage to seat new groups 4 times during the night.\n\nSo, my answer is 400 people served that night.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
