        "content": "In the town of Twisted Trails, where the trees twist and twirl,\nLived a silly snake named Samuel, with a tongue that was a whirl.\nHis scales were green and yellow, in a pattern most peculiar,\nAnd his nose was shaped like a question mark, which was quite irregular.\n\nSamuel loved to slither and slide, through the grass that was so tall,\nBut his tongue would get tangled, causing him much distress and all.\nHe'd try to taste the air, to smell the flowers so sweet,\nBut his tongue would knot and twist, making him feel quite beat.\n\nOne day, Samuel decided, \"I must fix this tongue of mine,\"\nSo he set off to see the wise old owl, who lived in a tree so fine.\n\"Owl,\" he said, \"My tongue is a trouble, it gets all twisted and turned,\nCan you help me, dear owl, to make it straight and learn?\"\n\nThe owl, with her wise eyes, looked at Samuel's tongue,\nAnd she said, \"My dear snake, your tongue is unique, it's not wrong.\nIn the land of Twisted Trails, uniqueness is celebrated, you see,\nYour tongue may twist and twirl, but it makes you who you are, uniquely.\"\n\nSamuel thought for a moment, and then he smiled wide,\n\"Maybe my tongue isn't a problem, maybe it's a friend inside.\"\nFrom that day on, Samuel learned to embrace his twisted tongue,\nAnd he found that it helped him taste things others couldn't, making him truly sprung.\n\nSo, in the town of Twisted Trails, where the trees twist and twirl,\nLived a silly snake named Samuel, with a tongue that was a whirl.\nAnd though it caused some trouble at first, he learned to see the good,\nIn his twisted, twirling tongue, that made him feel so hood."
