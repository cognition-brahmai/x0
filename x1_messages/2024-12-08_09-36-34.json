However, I can provide you with a simplified table featuring some well-known dinosaurs as examples.\n\n| Dinosaur Name | Type       | Habitat | Time Period       |\n|---------------|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| Tyrannosaurus Rex | Carnivore | Land    | Late Cretaceous   |\n| Stegosaurus   | Herbivore  | Land    | Late Jurassic     |\n| Velociraptor  | Carnivore  | Land    | Late Cretaceous   |\n| Brachiosaurus | Herbivore  | Land    | Late Jurassic     |\n| Pteranodon    | Carnivore  | Air     | Late Cretaceous   |\n| Ichthyosaurus | Carnivore  | Sea     | Early-Mid Jurassic|\n\nPlease note that this table is highly simplified and doesn't cover the full diversity of dinosaurs. Also, some classifications might be subject to debate among paleontologists.\n\nIf you need more detailed information or have specific dinosaurs in mind, feel free to ask!"
