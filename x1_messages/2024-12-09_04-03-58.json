        "content": "Let's see. The family wants to plant a garden with 7 rows, and each row should have 9 plants. So, first, I need to figure out how many plants they need in total.\n\nTo find the total number of plants required, I can multiply the number of rows by the number of plants per row. So, that's 7 rows times 9 plants per row. Let me do the multiplication: 7 times 9 is 63. So, they need 63 plants in total.\n\nNow, the family only has 50 plants. So, I need to compare the number of plants they have with the number they need. 50 is less than 63, so they don't have enough plants to complete their garden as planned.\n\nTo find out how many more plants they need, I can subtract the number of plants they have from the total number needed. That's 63 minus 50, which equals 13. So, they are short by 13 plants.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many rows they can complete with the 50 plants they have. Each row requires 9 plants, so I can divide the number of plants they have by the number of plants per row. 50 divided by 9 is approximately 5.555. Since they can't have a fraction of a row, they can complete 5 full rows with 50 plants.\n\nLet me check that: 5 rows times 9 plants per row is 45 plants. So, with 50 plants, after planting 5 rows, they would have 50 minus 45, which is 5 plants left.\n\nThey wouldn't have enough to plant a sixth row because that would require 9 plants, and they only have 5 left.\n\nSo, in conclusion, they cannot complete their garden plan with only 50 plants. They need 63 plants in total, so they are short by 13 plants.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No, they cannot complete their garden plan with only 50 plants. They need 63 plants in total.}} \\]"
