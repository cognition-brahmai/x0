        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we know that the factory produces 250 units of a product every hour, and each unit sells for $12. We need to find out how much revenue will be generated in one week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many units are produced in one hour:\n\\[ \\text{Units per hour} = 250 \\]\n\nNext, we need to know how many hours the factory operates in one week. Assuming the factory runs 24 hours a day for 7 days a week, the total hours in one week would be:\n\\[ \\text{Hours per week} = 24 \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days/week} = 168 \\, \\text{hours/week} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of units produced in one week:\n\\[ \\text{Total units per week} = \\text{Units per hour} \\times \\text{Hours per week} = 250 \\times 168 \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\\[ 250 \\times 168 = 42,000 \\, \\text{units} \\]\n\nEach unit sells for $12, so the total revenue generated in one week would be:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = \\text{Total units per week} \\times \\text{Price per unit} = 42,000 \\times 12 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\\[ 42,000 \\times 12 = 504,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the revenue generated in one week is $504,000.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm our answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the revenue generated per hour and then multiply by the total hours in a week.\n\nFirst, revenue per hour:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue per hour} = \\text{Units per hour} \\times \\text{Price per unit} = 250 \\times 12 = 3,000 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\]\n\nThen, total revenue per week:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue per week} = \\text{Revenue per hour} \\times \\text{Hours per week} = 3,000 \\times 168 \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\\[ 3,000 \\times 168 = 504,000 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\nSo, both methods give us the same answer: $504,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, are there any downtime periods in the factory where it's not producing at 250 units per hour? The problem doesn't mention any downtime, so we can assume that the factory operates at full capacity throughout the week.\n\nAlso, the problem states that each unit sells for $12. It doesn't specify any discounts or varying prices, so we can assume that every unit is sold at $12.\n\nAdditionally, we should ensure that our calculation for the number of hours in a week is correct. If the factory operates 24 hours a day for 7 days, it's indeed 168 hours. If there were any days off or partial days, we'd need to adjust that, but according to the problem, it's 24/7.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any units left unsold. However, the problem doesn't mention any unsold units, so we can assume that all produced units are sold.\n\nTherefore, our calculation seems solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{504000} \\]"
