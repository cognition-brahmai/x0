        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the factory produces 500 units of product A in 10 days. So, if they need to produce 1000 units in 20 days, that's double the amount in double the time. Intuitively, it seems like they might need the same number of workers, but let's see.\n\nEach unit requires 2 workers to be produced. So for 500 units, it would require 500 * 2 = 1000 worker-units. But this is over 10 days, so the total worker-days would be 1000 worker-units / 10 days = 100 workers per day.\n\nWait, but if each unit requires 2 workers, and they produce 500 units in 10 days, that means per day they produce 50 units (500 / 10 = 50). So for 50 units per day, they need 50 * 2 = 100 workers per day.\n\nNow, if they want to produce 1000 units in 20 days, that's 1000 / 20 = 50 units per day, which would again require 50 * 2 = 100 workers per day.\n\nSo, it seems like they would need the same number of workers, 100 workers per day.\n\nBut let's check if the number of days affects this. In the first scenario, 500 units in 10 days with 100 workers per day. In the second scenario, 1000 units in 20 days with 100 workers per day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can spread out the production differently. Let's consider the total worker-days required.\n\nIn the first scenario: 500 units * 2 workers/unit = 1000 worker-units. Over 10 days, that's 100 workers per day.\n\nIn the second scenario: 1000 units * 2 workers/unit = 2000 worker-units. Over 20 days, that's 100 workers per day.\n\nSo again, 100 workers per day are needed.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a more efficient way. Perhaps some workers can be reused over multiple units.\n\nBut according to the problem, each unit requires 2 workers to be produced. It doesn't specify if those are the same workers every time or if workers can be reassigned.\n\nAssuming that each unit requires 2 workers, and workers can be reassigned to different units on different days, then the total worker-units required would still be 2 per unit.\n\nTherefore, for 1000 units, it's 2000 worker-units. Over 20 days, that's again 100 workers per day.\n\nAlternatively, if workers cannot be reassigned and are tied to specific units, then perhaps more workers are needed.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems like 100 workers are sufficient.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the production rate.\n\nIn the first scenario, 500 units in 10 days with 100 workers per day.\n\nIn the second scenario, 1000 units in 20 days with 100 workers per day.\n\nSo, the production rate is the same: 50 units per day.\n\nEach unit still requires 2 workers.\n\nTherefore, the number of workers needed remains the same: 100 workers per day.\n\nSo, the answer should be 100 workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
