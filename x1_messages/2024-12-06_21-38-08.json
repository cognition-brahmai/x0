        "content": "So, I've got this probability question here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a jar with 4 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. The question is, what's the probability of not drawing a red marble when you pick one out randomly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability means in this context. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the favorable outcomes are not drawing a red marble. That means drawing either a blue or a green marble. And the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of marbles in the jar.\n\nLet me first find out the total number of marbles. There are 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green marbles. So, total marbles = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 marbles.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes, which is not drawing a red marble, means drawing either blue or green marbles. There are 3 blue and 2 green marbles, so favorable outcomes = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not drawing a red marble is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 5/9.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? I know that the probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event happening. So, the probability of not drawing a red marble should also be equal to 1 minus the probability of drawing a red marble.\n\nLet me check if I get the same answer this way. The probability of drawing a red marble is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 4/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not drawing a red marble is 1 - 4/9 = 5/9.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the probability is 5/9.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Are there any constraints or additional information in the problem that I might have missed?\n\nThe question says the marbles are picked randomly, so each marble has an equal chance of being picked. There's no mention of any marbles being identical or any other conditions that might affect the probability.\n\nAlso, since we're only drawing one marble, we don't have to worry about replacement or multiple draws.\n\nSo, I think 5/9 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the colors separately. The probability of drawing a blue marble is 3/9, and the probability of drawing a green marble is 2/9. So, the total probability of drawing either blue or green is 3/9 + 2/9 = 5/9.\n\nAgain, the same answer. This reinforces that 5/9 is correct.\n\nIs there a formula or a general approach for probability problems like this?\n\nYes, the general formula for probability is:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, favorable outcomes are not red marbles, which are blue and green marbles, totaling 5, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of marbles, which is 9.\n\nAlternatively, using the complement rule:\n\nProbability of not A = 1 - Probability of A\n\nWhere A is drawing a red marble.\n\nAgain, this gives us the same answer.\n\nIt's always good to check your answer using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the probability of not drawing a red marble is 5/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{9}} \\]"
