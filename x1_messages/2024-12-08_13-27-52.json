Below is a JavaScript function that takes a sentence as input and returns an object with the count of each word in the sentence.\n\n```javascript\nfunction countWords(sentence) {\n    // Convert the sentence to lowercase to make the count case-insensitive\n    const lowerCaseSentence = sentence.toLowerCase();\n    \n    // Split the sentence into words based on spaces\n    const words = lowerCaseSentence.split(' ');\n    \n    // Create an empty object to store word counts\n    const wordCounts = {};\n    \n    // Iterate over each word in the array\n    words.forEach(word => {\n        // Remove any punctuation from the word\n        const cleanedWord = word.replace(/[.,\\/#!$%\\^&\\*;:{}=\\-_`~()]/g,\"\");\n        \n        // If the word is already in the object, increment its count\n        // Otherwise, add the word to the object with a count of 1\n        if (cleanedWord in wordCounts) {\n            wordCounts[cleanedWord]++;\n        } else {\n            wordCounts[cleanedWord] = 1;\n        }\n    });\n    \n    // Return the object containing word counts\n    return wordCounts;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst sentence = \"This is a test sentence. This sentence is a test.\";\nconsole.log(countWords(sentence));\n// Output: { this: 2, is: 2, a: 2, test: 2, sentence: 2 }\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Convert to Lowercase:** The sentence is converted to lowercase to ensure that the word count is case-insensitive.\n2. **Split into Words:** The sentence is split into words based on spaces.\n3. **Clean Words:** Each word is cleaned to remove any punctuation using a regular expression.\n4. **Count Words:** An object is used to keep track of the count of each word. If a word is already in the object, its count is incremented; otherwise, it is added with a count of 1.\n5. **Return Word Counts:** The function returns the object containing the word counts.\n\nThis function should handle basic sentences and ignore punctuation, providing a accurate count of each word."
