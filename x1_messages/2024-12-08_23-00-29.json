        "content": "Anna and Lucy were sitting on Anna's couch, sipping coffee and catching up like they always did on Sundays. The sun was streaming through the curtains, casting a warm glow over the room. Anna had a secret she'd been dying to share, but at the same time, she was terrified of how Lucy would react.\n\n\"Lucy, there's something I need to tell you,\" Anna started, her voice trembling slightly.\n\nLucy looked up from her cup, concern etched on her face. \"What is it, Anna? You can tell me anything.\"\n\nAnna took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. \"I won the lottery.\"\n\nLucy's eyes widened in surprise. \"What? Really? That's amazing! How much did you win?\"\n\nAnna hesitated before answering. \"Um, a few million dollars.\"\n\nLucy's jaw dropped. \"A few million? Anna, that's incredible! This changes everything for you!\"\n\nAnna nodded, a mix of emotions swirling inside her. \"I know, but listen, Lucy, I need you to promise me something.\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Lucy replied immediately.\n\n\"Promise me you won't tell anyone else about this. Not even our other friends. I want to keep this a secret for now.\"\n\nLucy furrowed her brow, clearly confused. \"But why? Anna, this is huge news. People are going to want to know.\"\n\nAnna sighed, running a hand through her hair. \"I know, but I just... I don't want everyone knowing yet. I need time to figure out what to do with the money, you know? I don't want people asking for favors or trying to take advantage of me.\"\n\nLucy considered this for a moment. \"I understand where you're coming from, but are you sure that's the best approach? Maybe it would be better to be open about it and let people support you.\"\n\nAnna shook her head. \"No, Lucy, please trust me on this. I've thought long and hard about it, and I think keeping it quiet is the way to go right now. Besides, it's my money, and I should be able to decide who knows about it.\"\n\nLucy sighed, resigned. \"Alright, Anna, I promise I won't say anything to anyone. But please, at least consider telling your family. They deserve to know.\"\n\nAnna's expression darkened. \"My family? Lucy, you know how they are. They'd never let me hear the end of it. Plus, I don't want them breathing down my neck, expecting me to fix all their problems with this money.\"\n\nLucy leaned forward, placing a comforting hand on Anna's knee. \"I get that, but maybe if you talk to them, explain your reasons, they'll understand. Family is important, Anna.\"\n\nAnna looked down at her coffee cup, avoiding Lucy's gaze. \"I'll think about it, okay? For now, though, let's just keep this between us.\"\n\nLucy nodded, though she still seemed uneasy about the whole situation. \"Okay, Anna. But promise me one thing: you'll use this money wisely. Don't blow it all at once or make any hasty decisions.\"\n\nAnna smiled weakly. \"I promise, Lucy. I intend to make the most of this opportunity, but in my own time and way.\"\n\nLucy hugged her friend tightly. \"I'm so happy for you, Anna. Just remember, no matter what, I'm here for you.\"\n\nAnna returned the hug, feeling a mix of relief and guilt. She was grateful for Lucy's support, but she couldn't help wondering if keeping this secret was the right thing to do. Only time would tell.\n\n**END OF SCENE**"
