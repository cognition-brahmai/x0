        "content": "So the factory makes 1200 units each day, and each unit has a 2% chance of being defective. I need to find out, on average, how many defective units are produced per day.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"2% chance of being defective\" means. Probability tells us the likelihood of something happening, and 2% is the same as 0.02 in decimal form. So, for each unit, there's a 0.02 probability that it's defective.\n\nSince there are 1200 units produced daily, I can calculate the expected number of defective units by multiplying the total number of units by the probability of a unit being defective.\n\nSo, expected defective units = total units \u00d7 probability of being defective\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nExpected defective units = 1200 \u00d7 0.02\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n1200 \u00d7 0.02 = 24\n\nSo, on average, 24 units are defective per day.\n\nBut, to make sure I understand this correctly, I'll think about it another way. If each unit has a 2% chance of being defective, then out of every 100 units, on average, 2 units are defective because 100 \u00d7 0.02 = 2.\n\nSo, for 1200 units, I can think of it as 12 sets of 100 units. If each set of 100 has 2 defective units, then 12 sets would have 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 defective units.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 24 is the correct average number of defective units per day.\n\nAnother way to look at this is through the concept of expected value in probability. The expected value is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. In this case, the experiment is producing a unit and seeing if it's defective.\n\nThe expected value for a single unit being defective is:\n\nExpected value per unit = (probability of defective) \u00d7 (value if defective) + (probability of not defective) \u00d7 (value if not defective)\n\nBut since we're only interested in the number of defective units, not their value, we can simplify it to just the probability of being defective.\n\nSo, for each unit, the expected number of defective units is 0.02.\n\nFor 1200 units, the total expected number of defective units is 1200 \u00d7 0.02 = 24.\n\nThis aligns with both of my previous methods, so I'm sure that 24 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to explore a bit more, what if the probability of being defective was different? Say, 3%. Then, the expected number of defective units would be 1200 \u00d7 0.03 = 36.\n\nOr, if the factory produced a different number of units, say 1500 units per day, with the same 2% defect rate, the expected defective units would be 1500 \u00d7 0.02 = 30.\n\nThis shows that the expected number of defective units is directly proportional to both the total number of units produced and the probability of a unit being defective.\n\nIn real life, the number of defective units can vary from day to day due to randomness, but on average, over many days, it should be around 24.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that this assumes that the probability of being defective is independent for each unit, meaning that one unit being defective doesn't affect the probability of another unit being defective. In some cases, there might be factors that cause defects to be correlated, but in this problem, we can assume independence.\n\nFurthermore, this calculation doesn't account for any quality control measures that might be in place to detect and remove defective units before they are shipped. If there is inspection, the number of defective units that actually make it to the customer could be lower.\n\nBut based on the information given, the average number of defective units produced per day is 24.\n\nTo summarize, using the probability of a unit being defective and the total number of units produced daily, I calculated the expected number of defective units per day to be 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
