        "content": "Sure! Below is a Python script that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms using iteration:\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    sequence = []\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        sequence.append(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nnum_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\nfib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(num_terms)\nprint(\"Fibonacci sequence up to\", num_terms, \"terms:\", fib_sequence)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `generate_fibonacci(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to generate.\n2. **Initialization**: Inside the function, we initialize an empty list `sequence` to store the sequence and two variables `a` and `b` to hold the current and next Fibonacci numbers, starting with 0 and 1 respectively.\n3. **Iteration**: We use a for loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration, we append the current Fibonacci number `a` to the sequence list and update `a` and `b` to the next numbers in the sequence.\n4. **Return the Sequence**: After the loop completes, the function returns the list containing the Fibonacci sequence.\n5. **Example Usage**: We prompt the user to enter the number of terms they want in the sequence, generate the sequence using the function, and print it.\n\nThis script efficiently generates the Fibonacci sequence iteratively, avoiding the exponential time complexity associated with recursive approaches."
