        "content": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that a bee visits 100 flowers in a day and spends 5 minutes at each flower. So, to find out how many minutes the bee spends visiting flowers each day, we can multiply the number of flowers by the time spent per flower:\n\n100 flowers/day \u00d7 5 minutes/flower = 500 minutes/day\n\nNow, we need to convert minutes into hours because the question asks for hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n500 minutes/day \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 8.333... hours/day\n\nThat's approximately 8 hours and 20 minutes each day.\n\nNext, to find out how many hours the bee spends visiting flowers in a week, we need to multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week, which is 7:\n\n8.333... hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 58.333... hours/week\n\nSo, the bee spends approximately 58 hours and 20 minutes visiting flowers in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the total time spent per day first and then multiply by 7.\n\nTime spent per day:\n\n100 flowers \u00d7 5 minutes/flower = 500 minutes\n\nConvert minutes to hours:\n\n500 minutes \u00f7 60 = 8.333... hours\n\nNow, for a week:\n\n8.333... hours/day \u00d7 7 days = 58.333... hours\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the total time spent in minutes for the whole week and then convert to hours.\n\nFirst, find the total minutes spent per day:\n\n100 flowers/day \u00d7 5 minutes/flower = 500 minutes/day\n\nThen, for a week:\n\n500 minutes/day \u00d7 7 days = 3500 minutes\n\nNow, convert 3500 minutes to hours:\n\n3500 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 58.333... hours\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, the bee spends approximately 58 hours and 20 minutes visiting flowers in a week.\n\nBut to be more precise, 0.333... of an hour is exactly 20 minutes, since 0.333... \u00d7 60 = 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the exact time is 58 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nHowever, if the question expects the answer in hours, we can express it as 58 1/3 hours or approximately 58.33 hours.\n\nBut since the question says \"show your work,\" it's better to provide the exact value.\n\nSo, the bee spends 58 hours and 20 minutes visiting flowers in a week.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal form, that's 58.333... hours, which can be approximated as 58.33 hours.\n\nBut I think presenting it as 58 hours and 20 minutes is more straightforward.\n\nWait, but the question asks to show your work, so perhaps it's best to keep the units consistent.\n\nLet me see.\n\nStarting over:\n\nGiven:\n\n- Bee visits 100 flowers/day\n\n- Spends 5 minutes/flower\n\n- Find total hours spent visiting flowers in a week\n\nFirst, find total minutes spent per day:\n\n100 flowers/day \u00d7 5 minutes/flower = 500 minutes/day\n\nThen, convert minutes to hours:\n\n500 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 8.333... hours/day\n\nNow, for a week (7 days):\n\n8.333... hours/day \u00d7 7 days = 58.333... hours\n\nSo, the bee spends approximately 58.33 hours visiting flowers in a week.\n\nAlternatively, for more precision:\n\n500 minutes/day \u00d7 7 days = 3500 minutes\n\n3500 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 58.333... hours\n\nWhich is 58 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the bee spends 58 hours and 20 minutes visiting flowers in a week.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{58 \\text{ hours and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
