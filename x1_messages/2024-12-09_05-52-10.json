        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with 12 employees, and they need to form a committee of 4 members. But there's a catch: two specific employees can't be on the committee together because they don't get along. We need to figure out how many different committees can be formed under this condition.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of possible committees without any restrictions. Since it's about choosing 4 members out of 12, and the order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of unrestricted committees is C(12, 4). Let's calculate that:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 495.\n\nSo, there are 495 possible committees without any restrictions.\n\nNow, we need to account for the restriction that two specific employees can't be on the committee together. Let's call these two employees A and B. We need to exclude all the committees where both A and B are members.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many committees include both A and B.\n\nIf both A and B are on the committee, then we're choosing 2 more members from the remaining 10 employees (since there are 12 employees total, and A and B are already chosen).\n\nSo, the number of committees with both A and B is C(10, 2).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 committees where both A and B are members.\n\nTo find the number of committees where A and B are not both members, we subtract the number of committees with both A and B from the total number of unrestricted committees.\n\nSo, the number of valid committees is 495 - 45 = 450.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? Let's double-check to make sure we're not missing anything.\n\nWe started with the total number of possible committees, which is 495. Then, we identified that 45 of those committees include both A and B. Since these 45 committees are the ones we need to exclude, subtracting them from the total gives us 450 committees where A and B are not both members.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem to confirm our answer?\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the number of committees where either A or B is not included, or neither is included.\n\nLet's consider the following cases:\n\n1. Committees that include A but not B.\n\n2. Committees that include B but not A.\n\n3. Committees that include neither A nor B.\n\nWe need to add up the number of committees in these three cases to get the total number of valid committees.\n\nFirst, committees that include A but not B:\n\nIf A is included, and B is not, then we need to choose 3 more members from the remaining 10 employees (since B is excluded).\n\nSo, the number of such committees is C(10, 3).\n\nSimilarly, for committees that include B but not A, it's also C(10, 3).\n\nFor committees that include neither A nor B, we choose all 4 members from the remaining 10 employees, which is C(10, 4).\n\nSo, the total number of valid committees is C(10, 3) + C(10, 3) + C(10, 4).\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 120.\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 210.\n\nSo, total valid committees = 120 + 120 + 210 = 450.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation of 450 committees.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible committees that can be formed, given that two specific employees cannot be on the committee together, is 450.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this problem.\n\nSuppose we consider all possible committees and subtract those that violate the condition.\n\nWe already did that by subtracting the 45 committees where both A and B are included from the total of 495, arriving at 450.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states that to count the number of elements in the union of two sets, we add the sizes of the individual sets and subtract the size of their intersection.\n\nBut in this case, we're trying to exclude the committees where both A and B are included.\n\nSo, the total number of valid committees is the total committees minus the committees where both A and B are members.\n\nWhich is again 495 - 45 = 450.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the number of committees where A and B are not together.\n\nThis is equivalent to the total committees minus the committees where A and B are both members.\n\nAgain, 495 - 45 = 450.\n\nAlternatively, we could think in terms of permutations, but since the order doesn't matter in committees, combinations are the way to go.\n\nWait a second, maybe we can also think about selecting the committee step by step, considering the restrictions.\n\nFor example, when selecting the first member, we have 12 choices. For the second member, we have 11 choices, and so on, but we need to account for the restriction that A and B can't be together.\n\nHowever, since the committee is unordered, this approach might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nI think our initial approach of subtracting the invalid committees from the total is the most straightforward and accurate method.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 450 possible committees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]"
