        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: if you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what's the probability that the sum of the two rolls will be 7? Hmm, probability can be tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die twice. Since each roll is independent, and there are 6 faces on a die, the total number of outcomes should be 6 options for the first roll multiplied by 6 options for the second roll. So, 6 times 6 equals 36 possible outcomes in total.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, I need to find out how many of these 36 outcomes result in a sum of 7. So, I should list out all the possible pairs of rolls that add up to 7.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If the first roll is 1, the second roll needs to be 6 to make the sum 7 (1+6=7).\n\n- If the first roll is 2, the second roll needs to be 5 (2+5=7).\n\n- If the first roll is 3, the second roll needs to be 4 (3+4=7).\n\n- If the first roll is 4, the second roll needs to be 3 (4+3=7).\n\n- If the first roll is 5, the second roll needs to be 2 (5+2=7).\n\n- If the first roll is 6, the second roll needs to be 1 (6+1=7).\n\nSo, there are 6 possible combinations that result in a sum of 7.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, it's 6 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. Another way to look at it is to consider that for any first roll, there's only one second roll that will make the sum 7. Since the die is fair, each roll is equally likely, so the probability should indeed be 1/6.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider the sample space. There are 36 possible outcomes, and only 6 of them sum to 7, so again, 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of probability distributions. The sum of two six-sided dice follows a specific distribution, with sums ranging from 2 to 12. The sum of 7 is the most likely sum, and according to the distribution, it has the highest probability, which is 6/36 or 1/6.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with this answer. The probability is 1/6.\n\nBut just to explore it a bit more, suppose I wanted to find the probability of getting a sum of 7 or 11, like in craps. Well, that's a bit more complicated, but for this question, it's just about summing to 7.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the dice as distinct. So, die A and die B. Each has 6 faces, and we're looking for combinations where A + B = 7. As I listed earlier, there are 6 such combinations.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the dice as indistinct, meaning I don't care which die shows which number, but only the combination of numbers, then I would have to adjust for ordered vs. unordered pairs. But in this case, since the rolls are sequential (first roll and second roll), they are ordered pairs, so it's appropriate to consider them as distinct.\n\nWait, actually, in probability theory, even if the dice are indistinct, the outcomes are still considered distinct because each roll is independent. So, the total number of outcomes is still 36, and the number of favorable outcomes is 6.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Could the dice be non-standard, or loaded? The question says it's a fair six-sided die, so each face has an equal probability of landing face up.\n\nAlso, it's rolled twice, so two independent events.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the rolls are with replacement or without replacement. But since it's a die, and it's being rolled again, it's with replacement, meaning the outcome of the first roll doesn't affect the second roll.\n\nSo, indeed, the probability should be 1/6.\n\nJust to make sure, I can also simulate this. If I were to roll two dice many times and record the sum each time, the proportion of times the sum is 7 should approach 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could use probability formulas. The probability of event A (sum is 7) is equal to the number of ways A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nHere, number of ways A can occur is 6, total possible outcomes is 36, so P(A) = 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability of each individual combination that sums to 7. For example, P(1 on first roll and 6 on second roll) is (1/6)*(1/6) = 1/36. Similarly for each of the other combinations.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events (you can't have both 1 and 6 and also 2 and 5 at the same time), I can add up their probabilities.\n\nSo, P(sum is 7) = P(1,6) + P(2,5) + P(3,4) + P(4,3) + P(5,2) + P(6,1) = 6*(1/36) = 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The probability is 1/6.\n\nBut to be absolutely thorough, let's consider if there's any other possible way to get a sum of 7. For example, could the dice show the same number and sum to 7? Well, no, because 7 is odd, and two identical even or two identical odd numbers would sum to even or even, respectively.\n\nWait, actually, two identical numbers would only sum to even numbers, since even + even = even and odd + odd = even. So, 7 being odd, it's impossible to get it by rolling two identical numbers. That's consistent with the combinations I listed earlier, where all the pairs are different.\n\nAlso, could there be any mistake in counting the favorable outcomes? Let's list them again:\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\nThat's six outcomes. Is there a seventh? No, that's all of them.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider (3,4) and (4,3) as the same outcome, but again, since the rolls are ordered, they are distinct.\n\nSo, no, that's all.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 1/6.\n\nJust to relate this to other possible sums, for example, the probability of rolling a sum of 2 is only 1/36, since only (1,1) works.\n\nSimilarly, sum of 12 is also 1/36, only (6,6).\n\nSum of 3 is 2/36, from (1,2) and (2,1).\n\nAnd so on, with sum of 7 being the most probable, at 6/36 or 1/6.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that the sum of two rolls of a fair six-sided die is 7 is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
