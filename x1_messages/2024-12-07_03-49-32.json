        "content": "So, the company produces 1000 units of a product and sells each for $50. To find the total revenue, I need to multiply the number of units sold by the price per unit. So, that would be 1000 units times $50 per unit. Let me do the math:\n\n1000 \u00d7 50 = $50,000\n\nSo, the total revenue is $50,000.\n\nNow, to find the profit, I need to subtract the total cost of production from the total revenue. The production cost per unit is $30, so for 1000 units, the total cost would be 1000 times $30 per unit.\n\n1000 \u00d7 30 = $30,000\n\nSo, the total cost is $30,000.\n\nNow, profit is total revenue minus total cost:\n\n$50,000 \u2212 $30,000 = $20,000\n\nTherefore, the company's profit is $20,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20000} \\]"
