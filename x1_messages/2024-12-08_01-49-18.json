Each stage should correspond to an evidence value, which represents the outcome of one of the available operations given an input string that could be the user's inquiry, one or multiple prior evidence values, or a blend of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBingSearch[input]: Allows the user to perform an online search for data using Bing. This tool helps locate potential sites that might contain the answer to the user's query.\nPDFReader[input]: Reads PDF files from the URL(s) supplied as input and generates a textual output containing the file's contents.\nURLFinder[input]: Finds URLs embedded within a block of text provided as input and returns them as a list.\nAIQA[input]: An AI-based question-answering model that provides answers to queries based on an input text fragment. The input should be a text question referencing an #E[index] variable, e.g., What is the name of the dog, given #E1?\n\nEach function's input should be a simple string, without quotation marks or \"+\" to combine a string with an evidence variable, e.g., AIQA[What is the population of New York City, given #E3?]\n\nEnsure that there is only one evidence output for each plan step.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [First action based on the input question]\n#E1 = [Function to call with its input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on the result of #E1]\n#E2 = [Next function to call and its input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n], where n is the index of the last evidence\n\nQuestion: What were the main findings of the latest climate change report published by the United Nations?"
