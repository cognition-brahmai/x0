        "content": "So I have this problem here: a cone with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 5 cm, and I need to find its surface area in square centimeters. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I recall that the surface area of a cone consists of two parts: the base area and the lateral surface area. The base is a circle, so its area is straightforward, but the lateral surface area is a bit more complicated because it's curved.\n\nLet me start with the base area. The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. Given that the radius is 3 cm, the base area should be:\n\nA_base = \u03c0 * (3 cm)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 9 cm\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nOkay, that's the base area. Now, for the lateral surface area. I think the formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is A_lateral = \u03c0rL, where L is the slant height of the cone. But wait, the problem gives me the height, not the slant height. So, I need to find the slant height first.\n\nI remember that in a cone, the radius, height, and slant height are related by the Pythagorean theorem because the height, radius, and slant height form a right-angled triangle. So, L = \u221a(r\u00b2 + h\u00b2).\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nL = \u221a((3 cm)\u00b2 + (5 cm)\u00b2) = \u221a(9 cm\u00b2 + 25 cm\u00b2) = \u221a(34 cm\u00b2) = \u221a34 cm\n\nAlright, so the slant height is \u221a34 cm. Now, I can find the lateral surface area:\n\nA_lateral = \u03c0 * 3 cm * \u221a34 cm = 3\u03c0\u221a34 cm\u00b2\n\nNow, to find the total surface area, I need to add the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 9\u03c0 cm\u00b2 + 3\u03c0\u221a34 cm\u00b2\n\nI can factor out \u03c0:\n\nA_total = \u03c0(9 + 3\u221a34) cm\u00b2\n\nBut maybe I can simplify this further. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \u221a34 is already in its simplest radical form since 34 has no perfect square factors other than 1. So, 3\u221a34 is as simple as it gets.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area is \u03c0(9 + 3\u221a34) cm\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can factor out a 3 from the expression inside the parentheses:\n\nA_total = \u03c0 * 3(3 + \u221a34) cm\u00b2 = 3\u03c0(3 + \u221a34) cm\u00b2\n\nI think that looks a bit cleaner. So, the surface area is 3\u03c0(3 + \u221a34) cm\u00b2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if this is correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the surface area of a cone can also be calculated using the formula A = \u03c0r(r + L), where r is the radius and L is the slant height. Let's try that.\n\nA = \u03c0 * 3 cm * (3 cm + \u221a34 cm) = \u03c0 * 3 cm * (3 + \u221a34) cm = 3\u03c0(3 + \u221a34) cm\u00b2\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to get a numerical value, I can approximate \u03c0 as 3.14 and \u221a34 is approximately 5.83, but since the problem asks for the surface area in terms of \u03c0, I think leaving it in exact form is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the cone is 3\u03c0(3 + \u221a34) square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3\\pi(3 + \\sqrt{34})} \\]"
