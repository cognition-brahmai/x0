        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 3 barbers in this town, each with different hair-cutting times: Barber A takes 15 minutes, Barber B takes 20 minutes, and Barber C takes 25 minutes per customer. They all start cutting hair at the same time, and we need to find out how long it will take for them to finish cutting the hair of 60 customers in total.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many customers each barber can serve in a given amount of time. Since they all start at the same time, they'll be working simultaneously. So, their individual rates of cutting hair will add up.\n\nLet me calculate their rates per minute.\n\nBarber A: 1 customer every 15 minutes, so his rate is 1/15 customers per minute.\n\nBarber B: 1 customer every 20 minutes, so his rate is 1/20 customers per minute.\n\nBarber C: 1 customer every 25 minutes, so his rate is 1/25 customers per minute.\n\nNow, if they all work together, their combined rate should be the sum of their individual rates.\n\nSo, total rate = (1/15) + (1/20) + (1/25) customers per minute.\n\nI need to add these fractions. To add them, I need a common denominator. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15, 20, and 25.\n\nThe prime factors are:\n\n15 = 3 \u00d7 5\n\n20 = 2^2 \u00d7 5\n\n25 = 5^2\n\nSo, the LCM would be the highest power of each prime present: 2^2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5^2 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 25 = 300.\n\nSo, the common denominator is 300.\n\nNow, convert each fraction:\n\n1/15 = 20/300\n\n1/20 = 15/300\n\n1/25 = 12/300\n\nAdd them up: 20 + 15 + 12 = 47/300 customers per minute.\n\nSo, together, they can serve 47/300 customers per minute.\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it will take for them to serve 60 customers.\n\nTime = total customers / rate\n\nTime = 60 / (47/300) minutes\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\nSo, time = 60 \u00d7 (300/47) minutes\n\nCalculate that:\n\n60 \u00d7 300 = 18,000\n\n18,000 / 47 \u2248 382.9787 minutes\n\nSo, it would take approximately 383 minutes for all three barbers to cut the hair of 60 customers.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about how many customers each barber serves in a certain time and see when the total reaches 60.\n\nLet\u2019s denote t as the time in minutes that all barbers are working.\n\nIn t minutes, Barber A can serve t / 15 customers.\n\nBarber B can serve t / 20 customers.\n\nBarber C can serve t / 25 customers.\n\nSo, the total number of customers served is (t / 15) + (t / 20) + (t / 25) = 60\n\nThis is the same as the combined rate approach I used earlier.\n\nSo, (t / 15) + (t / 20) + (t / 25) = 60\n\nWe can factor t out: t \u00d7 (1/15 + 1/20 + 1/25) = 60\n\nWe already know that 1/15 + 1/20 + 1/25 = 47/300\n\nSo, t \u00d7 (47/300) = 60\n\nThen, t = 60 / (47/300) = 60 \u00d7 (300/47) \u2248 382.9787 minutes\n\nSo, it confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the time it takes for the slowest barber to finish and see if that makes sense.\n\nBarber C is the slowest, taking 25 minutes per customer.\n\nIf Barber C had to do all 60 customers alone, it would take 60 \u00d7 25 = 1500 minutes.\n\nBut since there are faster barbers helping, the total time should be less, which it is (383 minutes vs 1500 minutes).\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many customers they can serve per minute together, which is what I did first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate how many customers they serve together in one minute, which is 47/300 customers per minute, and then find out how long it takes to reach 60 customers.\n\nYes, that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the least common multiple of their service times.\n\nBut I think the rate approach is the most straightforward.\n\nSo, I think 383 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a more precise way to express it.\n\n382.9787 minutes is approximately 383 minutes, but perhaps it's better to express it in minutes and seconds.\n\nSo, 0.9787 minutes is roughly 0.9787 \u00d7 60 \u2248 58.72 seconds.\n\nSo, it's about 383 minutes and 59 seconds.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the precision required, 383 minutes is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it in hours and minutes.\n\n383 minutes is 6 hours and 23 minutes.\n\nBecause 6 \u00d7 60 = 360, and 383 - 360 = 23 minutes.\n\nSo, 6 hours and 23 minutes.\n\nBut again, the question doesn't specify the format, so 383 minutes is fine.\n\nI think the answer is approximately 383 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{383 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
