        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular garden that's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, and I need to find out what the area is in square yards. Okay, first things first, I know that area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, in this case, it would be 20 feet times 15 feet.\n\nLet me just write that down:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\nArea = 20 ft \u00d7 15 ft\n\nThat gives me 300 square feet. But the question wants the area in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards.\n\nI recall that 1 yard equals 3 feet. Therefore, 1 square yard would be 3 feet by 3 feet, which is 9 square feet.\n\nSo, to convert from square feet to square yards, I should divide the number of square feet by 9.\n\nLet me check that:\n\n1 square yard = 9 square feet\n\nTherefore, to find out how many square yards are in 300 square feet, I divide 300 by 9.\n\n300 \u00f7 9 = 33.333... which is 33 and one-third.\n\nSo, the area of the garden is 33.333... square yards. But maybe I should leave it as a fraction for exactness.\n\n300 divided by 9 is equal to 100 divided by 3, which is 33 and 1/3.\n\nSo, 33 1/3 square yards.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that conversion again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the dimensions: 20 feet by 15 feet.\n\nArea in square feet: 20 \u00d7 15 = 300 sq ft.\n\nNow, converting to square yards.\n\nSince 1 yard = 3 feet, then 1 square yard = 3 ft \u00d7 3 ft = 9 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, to find square yards, divide square feet by 9.\n\n300 \u00f7 9 = 33.333..., which is indeed 33 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the original dimensions from feet to yards before multiplying.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, convert the length and width to yards.\n\nLength: 20 feet \u00f7 3 = approximately 6.666... yards.\n\nWidth: 15 feet \u00f7 3 = 5 yards.\n\nNow, multiply them to get the area in square yards.\n\n6.666... \u00d7 5 = 33.333... square yards.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, either way, I end up with 33 1/3 square yards.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nMaybe using the conversion factor directly in the formula.\n\nArea in square feet is 20 ft \u00d7 15 ft = 300 sq ft.\n\nNow, since 1 square yard = 9 square feet, then:\n\nArea in square yards = area in square feet / 9 = 300 / 9 = 33.333... sq yd.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of units.\n\n20 feet is 20/3 yards, and 15 feet is 15/3 yards.\n\nSo, area = (20/3) yards \u00d7 (15/3) yards = (20/3 \u00d7 15/3) sq yd = (300/9) sq yd = 33.333... sq yd.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the area of the garden is 33 1/3 square yards.\n\nI think that's as accurate as I can get.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33\\frac{1}{3}} \\]"
