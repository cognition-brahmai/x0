        "content": "In computational fluid dynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations are typically solved using numerical methods due to their complexity and nonlinearity. Among the options provided, the finite volume method is a popular choice for solving these equations.\n\nThe finite volume method discretizes the domain into small control volumes and applies the integral form of the governing equations to each control volume. This approach ensures the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across the entire domain. It is widely used in commercial CFD software packages like ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM.\n\nEuler's method and Runge-Kutta methods are time-stepping schemes used for solving ordinary differential equations, not specifically for the Navier-Stokes equations in CFD. Newton's method is an iterative root-finding algorithm and is not directly used for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in CFD.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Finite volume method.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
