        "content": "The United Nations Sustainable Energy for All initiative has several key goals, but among the options you've provided, the primary goal is A. Ensuring universal access to modern energy services.\n\nThis initiative was launched in 2011 with the aim of achieving three interlinked objectives by 2030:\n\n1. Ensuring universal access to modern energy services: This means making sure that everyone around the world has access to reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy sources, including electricity and clean cooking solutions.\n\n2. Doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency: This involves making better use of energy resources to reduce waste and lower the environmental impact of energy production and consumption.\n\n3. Doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix: This goal focuses on increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nOption B, promoting the use of fossil fuels, is contrary to the Sustainable Energy for All initiative's aims, as it seeks to reduce dependence on fossil fuels in favor of cleaner, renewable energy sources.\n\nOption C, reducing the use of renewable energy sources, is also opposite to the initiative's objectives, which are centered around increasing the adoption and use of renewable energy.\n\nOption D, increasing the dependence on nuclear energy, is not a primary focus of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative. While nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon source of energy, the initiative primarily promotes renewable energy sources and improved energy efficiency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Ensuring universal access to modern energy services.\n\n**Reference:**\nUnited Nations Sustainable Energy for All. (n.d.). Our objectives.
