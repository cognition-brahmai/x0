        "content": "Let's see. The train travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour and takes 10 hours to complete its journey. It makes 5 stops along the way, each lasting 15 minutes. I need to find out how long the train was actually moving during the trip.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total time spent stopping. Since each stop lasts 15 minutes and there are 5 stops, the total stopping time is 5 times 15 minutes, which is 75 minutes. But since the time of the journey is given in hours, it might be easier to convert this stopping time into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 75 minutes is 75 divided by 60, which is 1.25 hours.\n\nNow, the total journey time is 10 hours, and the stopping time is 1.25 hours. So, the moving time should be the total journey time minus the stopping time, right? That would be 10 hours minus 1.25 hours, which is 8.75 hours.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. The average speed is 50 miles per hour, and the total journey time is 10 hours, including stops. So, the total distance should be average speed multiplied by total time, which would be 50 miles per hour times 10 hours, equaling 500 miles.\n\nNow, if the train was moving at 50 miles per hour and covered 500 miles, the moving time would be the distance divided by the speed, which is 500 miles divided by 50 miles per hour, equaling 10 hours. But that can't be right because we know there were stops totaling 1.25 hours. So, perhaps I need to consider that the average speed takes into account the stops.\n\nMaybe I should think about the average speed formula. Average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if the average speed is 50 miles per hour and the total time is 10 hours, then the total distance is indeed 500 miles.\n\nNow, if the train was moving at 50 miles per hour and the total distance is 500 miles, but the total time is 10 hours including stops, then the moving time plus the stopping time equals 10 hours. We already calculated the stopping time as 1.25 hours, so moving time is 10 minus 1.25, which is 8.75 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up an equation. Let\u2019s let m be the moving time in hours. Then, the distance covered while moving is 50 times m miles. The stopping time is 5 stops times 15 minutes each, which is 75 minutes or 1.25 hours. So, the total time is moving time plus stopping time: m + 1.25 = 10 hours. Solving for m, m = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75 hours.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the train is moving at 50 mph for m hours and stopped for 1.25 hours, and the total time is 10 hours. The distance is only covered during the moving time, so distance = 50 * m. But we also know that distance can be calculated as average speed times total time, which is 50 * 10 = 500 miles. So, 50 * m = 500, which gives m = 10 hours. Wait, that can't be right because we know there were stops.\n\nI think the confusion arises from the fact that the average speed includes the stopping time. So, the average speed is not the same as the moving speed. Maybe I need to find the moving speed.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- s_m = moving speed = 50 mph\n\n- t_m = moving time in hours\n\n- t_s = stopping time = 1.25 hours\n\n- t_t = total time = 10 hours\n\n- d = total distance\n\nThe total distance is d = s_m * t_m\n\nAlso, t_t = t_m + t_s => t_m = t_t - t_s = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75 hours\n\nSo, the train was moving for 8.75 hours.\n\nAlternatively, the average speed s_a is given by s_a = d / t_t\n\nWe know s_a = 50 mph, t_t = 10 hours, so d = 50 * 10 = 500 miles\n\nNow, using d = s_m * t_m, we have 500 = 50 * t_m => t_m = 500 / 50 = 10 hours\n\nBut this contradicts the stopping time. So, there must be a mistake in assuming that the moving speed is 50 mph.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the 50 mph is the average speed including stops. The problem says \"average speed of 50 mph.\" So, perhaps the moving speed is higher, and the average is reduced by the stopping time.\n\nLet me think differently. Let\u2019s denote s_m as the moving speed.\n\nThen, distance d = s_m * t_m\n\nAlso, t_m = t_t - t_s = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75 hours\n\nAverage speed s_a = d / t_t = (s_m * t_m) / t_t = s_m * (t_m / t_t)\n\nWe know s_a = 50 mph, t_m = 8.75 hours, t_t = 10 hours\n\nSo, 50 = s_m * (8.75 / 10) => s_m = 50 * (10 / 8.75) = 500 / 8.75 \u2248 57.14 mph\n\nWait, but the problem says the train travels at an average speed of 50 mph, and that's including the stops. So, the moving speed is higher, but the question is to find the moving time.\n\nFrom earlier, moving time t_m = total time - stopping time = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75 hours\n\nSo, the train was moving for 8.75 hours.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to this. Maybe the train is not moving at a constant speed while moving, but the problem says \"travels at an average speed of 50 mph,\" which likely means that's the overall average including stops.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 50 mph is the moving speed, and I need to find the moving time.\n\nLet me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: 50 mph is the overall average speed including stops.\n\nIn this case, total distance d = 50 mph * 10 hours = 500 miles\n\nMoving time t_m = d / moving speed s_m\n\nBut we don't know s_m, the moving speed.\n\nWait, the problem says \"travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour,\" which probably includes stops. So, overall average speed is 50 mph.\n\nTherefore, total distance is 500 miles, and moving time is t_m = t_t - t_s = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75 hours\n\nSo, the train was moving for 8.75 hours.\n\nSecond interpretation: 50 mph is the moving speed.\n\nIn this case, total distance d = moving speed * moving time = 50 * t_m\n\nAlso, total time t_t = moving time + stopping time => t_m = t_t - t_s = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75 hours\n\nSo, d = 50 * 8.75 = 437.5 miles\n\nBut then the overall average speed s_a = d / t_t = 437.5 / 10 = 43.75 mph, which contradicts the given average speed of 50 mph.\n\nTherefore, the first interpretation must be correct: the overall average speed is 50 mph, and the moving speed is higher.\n\nSo, moving time is 8.75 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the moving speed is 50 mph, and the average speed is less due to stops.\n\nBut in that case, as shown, the average speed would be 43.75 mph, which doesn't match the given 50 mph.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the 50 mph is the moving speed, and I need to find the moving time such that the overall average speed is accounted for.\n\nLet me set up an equation.\n\nLet t_m be the moving time in hours.\n\nThen, total distance d = moving speed * moving time = 50 * t_m miles\n\nTotal time t_t = moving time + stopping time = t_m + 1.25 hours\n\nAverage speed s_a = total distance / total time = (50 * t_m) / (t_m + 1.25)\n\nWe know s_a = 50 mph, so:\n\n50 = (50 * t_m) / (t_m + 1.25)\n\nMultiply both sides by (t_m + 1.25):\n\n50 * (t_m + 1.25) = 50 * t_m\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n50 * t_m + 50 * 1.25 = 50 * t_m\n\nSo, 50 * t_m + 62.5 = 50 * t_m\n\nSubtract 50 * t_m from both sides:\n\n62.5 = 0\n\nThis makes no sense. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nAh, I see. The problem says \"travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.\" If the moving speed is also 50 mph, then the calculation becomes problematic because the average speed should be less than the moving speed if there are stops. But in this case, setting them equal leads to an inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, it must be that the moving speed is higher than the average speed. Let's denote the moving speed as s_m.\n\nThen, total distance d = s_m * t_m\n\nTotal time t_t = t_m + t_s = t_m + 1.25 hours\n\nAverage speed s_a = d / t_t = (s_m * t_m) / (t_m + 1.25) = 50 mph\n\nWe have one equation with two variables, s_m and t_m. We need another equation to solve for t_m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express s_m in terms of t_m and substitute.\n\nFrom the average speed equation:\n\n50 = (s_m * t_m) / (t_m + 1.25)\n\nSo, s_m = 50 * (t_m + 1.25) / t_m\n\nBut without another equation, I can't solve for t_m directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the moving speed s_m is constant, but I don't know its value. Maybe I need to find t_m in terms of s_m or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the total distance in terms of the moving speed and time.\n\nTotal distance d = s_m * t_m\n\nAlso, d = s_a * t_t = 50 * 10 = 500 miles\n\nSo, s_m * t_m = 500\n\nAnd t_m = t_t - t_s = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75 hours\n\nTherefore, s_m = 500 / 8.75 \u2248 57.14 mph\n\nSo, the moving speed is approximately 57.14 mph, and the moving time is 8.75 hours.\n\nBut the question is to find the moving time, which is 8.75 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total time of 10 hours, which includes both moving and stopping time.\n\nThe stopping time is 5 stops * 15 minutes each = 75 minutes = 1.25 hours.\n\nTherefore, moving time = total time - stopping time = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75 hours.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but maybe there's a trick here.\n\nWait, perhaps the train is moving between stops and stops for 15 minutes at each stop.\n\nIf there are 5 stops, does that mean the train stops 5 times during the journey?\n\nAssuming the journey starts and ends without stops, the number of stops would be equal to the number of stops made along the way.\n\nSo, 5 stops seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the number of stops can be one less than the number of segments traveled, but in this case, it's specified as 5 stops.\n\nTherefore, the total stopping time is indeed 5 * 15 minutes = 75 minutes = 1.25 hours.\n\nHence, moving time is 10 hours - 1.25 hours = 8.75 hours.\n\nTo confirm, perhaps I can calculate the total distance.\n\nAverage speed is 50 mph over 10 hours, so total distance is 500 miles.\n\nIf the train moves at a constant speed of 50 mph for 8.75 hours, it would cover 50 * 8.75 = 437.5 miles, which is less than the total distance.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that the moving speed is higher if the average speed includes stops, but in this case, if the moving speed is 50 mph and the moving time is 8.75 hours, the distance covered would be 437.5 miles, but the total distance should be 500 miles.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the moving speed is higher than 50 mph.\n\nLet me denote s_m as the moving speed.\n\nThen, distance d = s_m * t_m = s_m * (10 - 1.25) = s_m * 8.75\n\nBut also, d = average speed * total time = 50 * 10 = 500 miles\n\nSo, s_m * 8.75 = 500\n\nTherefore, s_m = 500 / 8.75 \u2248 57.14 mph\n\nSo, the moving speed is approximately 57.14 mph, and the moving time is 8.75 hours.\n\nTherefore, the train was moving for 8.75 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if the moving speed is 50 mph, then the distance covered while moving would be 50 * t_m miles.\n\nThe total distance is 500 miles, so 50 * t_m = 500 => t_m = 10 hours\n\nBut the total time is 10 hours, including stops, which would mean the stopping time is 0, which contradicts the given stopping time of 1.25 hours.\n\nTherefore, the moving speed must be higher than the average speed.\n\nSo, the correct moving time is 8.75 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in hours and minutes.\n\n8.75 hours is 8 hours and 0.75 * 60 minutes = 45 minutes.\n\nSo, 8 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nBut the question asks for how long the train was actually moving during the trip, and 8.75 hours is a correct answer, but expressing it as 8 hours and 45 minutes might be more understandable.\n\nHowever, since the stopping time was given in hours and minutes, perhaps the answer should be in the same units.\n\nWait, the stopping time was given as 15 minutes per stop, and total stopping time was 1.25 hours, which is 75 minutes.\n\nThe total journey time is 10 hours, which is 10 hours * 60 minutes = 600 minutes.\n\nTotal stopping time is 75 minutes.\n\nTherefore, moving time is 600 - 75 = 525 minutes.\n\nConverting 525 minutes back to hours: 525 / 60 = 8.75 hours, or 8 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo, the train was moving for 8 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in hours with decimal places.\n\nIn that case, 8.75 hours is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a more precise way to calculate this, considering the time spent moving and stopped.\n\nBut given the information, the straightforward calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the train was moving for 8.75 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8.75 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
