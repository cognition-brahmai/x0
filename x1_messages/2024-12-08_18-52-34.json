It's this puzzle toy that's shaped like a cube, and each face has nine stickers of different colors. The goal is to twist and turn the cube so that each side is all one color. It's been around for a really long time and is still super popular. I remember trying to solve one when I was a kid, but I never could figure it out. It's amazing how something so simple in design can be so challenging to master."
