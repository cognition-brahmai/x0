        "content": "Let's tackle this snail problem. So, we've got a snail that's climbing up a 30-foot wall. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slips back 2 feet. We need to figure out how many days it will take for the snail to reach the top.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening each day. During the day, the snail climbs up 3 feet, but then at night, it slips back 2 feet. So, the net progress each day is 3 feet up minus 2 feet back, which is 1 foot of progress per day.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. If it's making 1 foot of progress each day, then for a 30-foot wall, it would take 30 days. But let's think about it more carefully.\n\nLet's consider the snail's position at the end of each day. On day one, it climbs 3 feet and then slips back 2 feet, so it ends up at 1 foot. On day two, it climbs another 3 feet from 1 foot to 4 feet, and then slips back 2 feet to 2 feet. Wait, that doesn't seem right. If it's at 1 foot at the end of day one, on day two, it climbs up 3 feet from there, reaching 4 feet, and then slips back 2 feet to 2 feet.\n\nHold on, maybe I need to track its progress more carefully.\n\nLet's make a table to track the snail's position at the end of each day:\n\n- Start: 0 feet\n\n- Day 1: climbs 3 feet -> 0 + 3 = 3 feet; slips back 2 feet -> 3 - 2 = 1 foot\n\n- Day 2: climbs 3 feet from 1 foot -> 1 + 3 = 4 feet; slips back 2 feet -> 4 - 2 = 2 feet\n\n- Day 3: climbs 3 feet from 2 feet -> 2 + 3 = 5 feet; slips back 2 feet -> 5 - 2 = 3 feet\n\n- Day 4: climbs 3 feet from 3 feet -> 3 + 3 = 6 feet; slips back 2 feet -> 6 - 2 = 4 feet\n\n- And so on...\n\nI see a pattern here. Each day, the snail is making a net progress of 1 foot. So, at the end of day n, the snail is at position n feet.\n\nBut, when does the snail reach the top? If the wall is 30 feet high, does it mean on day 30, the snail reaches 30 feet?\n\nWait, but on day 30, according to this pattern, the snail would climb up 3 feet from 29 feet to 32 feet, and then slip back 2 feet to 30 feet. So, it would reach the top during the day on day 30.\n\nBut let's confirm this.\n\nLet's think about it differently. Each day, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot, but on the final day, it might reach the top during the day and not slip back.\n\nSo, perhaps on the last day, it climbs the remaining distance without slipping back.\n\nWait, but in this problem, it slips back every night after climbing during the day, unless it reaches the top during the day.\n\nSo, we need to consider that on the final day, it might climb up and reach or surpass the top without slipping back.\n\nLet's adjust our approach.\n\nSuppose the snail needs to reach 30 feet.\n\nEach day, it climbs 3 feet and slips back 2 feet, making 1 foot net progress per day.\n\nBut on the last day, if it climbs 3 feet and reaches or surpasses the top, it won't slip back.\n\nSo, we need to find out on which day it climbs up to or past 30 feet during the day.\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nSuppose on day n, the snail climbs up 3 feet from its position at the start of the day and reaches or surpasses 30 feet.\n\nAt the start of day n, its position is (n - 1) feet, because each previous day it had made 1 foot net progress.\n\nThen, on day n, it climbs 3 feet from (n - 1) feet, reaching (n - 1 + 3) = (n + 2) feet.\n\nIf (n + 2) >= 30, then it reaches the top on day n without slipping back.\n\nSo, we have n + 2 >= 30, which means n >= 28.\n\nTherefore, on day 28, the snail climbs from 27 feet to 30 feet during the day and reaches the top, without slipping back at night.\n\nWait, let's verify this.\n\nAt the start of day 28, the snail is at 27 feet (since at the end of day 27, it would be at 27 feet, having made 1 foot net progress each day).\n\nOn day 28, it climbs 3 feet from 27 feet to 30 feet, reaching the top, and doesn't slip back.\n\nSo, it takes 28 days for the snail to reach the top.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it would take 30 days, but now it seems it takes 28 days.\n\nLet me check another way.\n\nEach day, net progress is 1 foot, but on the last day, it makes 3 feet without slipping back.\n\nSo, total progress is 1 foot per day for (n - 1) days, plus 3 feet on the last day.\n\nSo, (n - 1) + 3 >= 30\n\nWhich simplifies to n + 2 >= 30\n\nThus, n >= 28\n\nSo, 28 days.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the snail needs to reach position 27 feet at the start of day 28, and then on day 28, it climbs 3 feet to reach 30 feet.\n\nSince it doesn't slip back on the day it reaches the top, it takes 28 days.\n\nBut wait, some similar problems might have different conditions, so it's important to be precise.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that every day, the snail makes a net progress of 1 foot, except for the last day when it reaches the top.\n\nSo, for the first (n - 1) days, it makes 1 foot net progress per day, totaling (n - 1) feet.\n\nOn the last day, it climbs 3 feet to reach the top without slipping back.\n\nSo, the total distance climbed is (n - 1) + 3 >= 30\n\nAgain, n + 2 >= 30, so n >= 28\n\nTherefore, it takes 28 days.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think about what happens on day 27.\n\nAt the start of day 27, the snail is at 26 feet (since at the end of day 26, it was at 26 feet).\n\nOn day 27, it climbs 3 feet to 29 feet, and then slips back 2 feet to 27 feet.\n\nThen, on day 28, it climbs 3 feet from 27 feet to 30 feet, reaching the top.\n\nSince it has reached the top during the day, it doesn't slip back at night.\n\nTherefore, it takes 28 days for the snail to reach the top of the 30-foot wall.\n\nSo, the answer is 28 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
