        "content": "Sure! I'll create a TypeScript class for a rectangle, which includes methods to calculate its area and perimeter. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```typescript\nclass Rectangle {\n    width: number;\n    height: number;\n\n    constructor(width: number, height: number) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    area(): number {\n        return this.width * this.height;\n    }\n\n    perimeter(): number {\n        return 2 * (this.width + this.height);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst rect = new Rectangle(5, 10);\nconsole.log(`Area: ${rect.area()}`); // Output: Area: 50\nconsole.log(`Perimeter: ${rect.perimeter()}`); // Output: Perimeter: 30\n```\n\nIn this class:\n\n- The `constructor` initializes the `width` and `height` properties.\n\n- The `area` method calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying its width and height.\n\n- The `perimeter` method calculates the perimeter by adding up all sides, which is twice the sum of the width and height.\n\nYou can create an instance of the `Rectangle` class with specific dimensions and then call the `area` and `perimeter` methods to get the respective calculations."
