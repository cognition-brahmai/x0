Here's a simple Python function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef circle_area(radius):\n    return math.pi * radius ** 2\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing the radius of the circle as an argument. For example, to find the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units, you would call `circle_area(5)`."
