Then, 3 more people enter the room, and they are all wearing glasses. So now, the total number of people in the room is 10 plus 3, which is 13 people.\n\nOut of these 13 people, the number wearing glasses is the original 5 plus the 3 new ones, so that's 5 + 3 = 8 people wearing glasses.\n\nTo find the fraction of people wearing glasses now, we take the number wearing glasses divided by the total number of people, which is 8/13.\n\nSo, the fraction is 8/13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{13}} \\]"
