        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a town, 30% of people own cats, 45% own dogs, and 15% own both cats and dogs. I need to find out what percentage of people do not own any pets. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that percentages here represent parts of the town's population. So, 30% own cats, 45% own dogs, and 15% own both. I need to find out who doesn't own any pets, meaning they don't own cats or dogs.\n\nI remember there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here. It helps to avoid double-counting when dealing with overlapping sets.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\n- Let C be the set of people who own cats.\n\n- Let D be the set of people who own dogs.\n\nI'm given:\n\n- Percentage of people who own cats, which is |C| = 30%.\n\n- Percentage of people who own dogs, which is |D| = 45%.\n\n- Percentage of people who own both cats and dogs, which is |C \u2229 D| = 15%.\n\nI need to find the percentage of people who do not own any pets, which would be the complement of the set of people who own either cats or dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to find the percentage of people who own either cats or dogs, which is |C \u222a D|.\n\nAccording to the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|C \u222a D| = |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D|\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n|C \u222a D| = 30% + 45% - 15% = 60%\n\nSo, 60% of people own either cats or dogs.\n\nNow, the percentage of people who do not own any pets would be the complement of this, which is:\n\n100% - |C \u222a D| = 100% - 60% = 40%\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nI have 30% owning cats, 45% owning dogs, and 15% owning both. If I add 30% and 45%, that's 75%, but that includes the 15% who own both twice, once in cats and once in dogs. So, to avoid double-counting, I subtract the 15% who own both, resulting in 60%. Then, the remaining 40% don't own any pets.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle is for cat owners, the other for dog owners. The overlapping part is those who own both.\n\n- Only cat owners: 30% - 15% = 15%\n\n- Only dog owners: 45% - 15% = 30%\n\n- Both cats and dogs: 15%\n\n- Total pet owners: 15% + 30% + 15% = 60%\n\n- Therefore, no pets: 100% - 60% = 40%\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to approach this to confirm? Maybe using probabilities or formulas differently.\n\nAnother formula I recall is:\n\n|C \u222a D| = |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D|\n\nWhich is the same as the inclusion-exclusion principle I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that some people own neither, and some own both, the formula becomes:\n\n|C \u222a D| = |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D|\n\nAnd the percentage who own neither is 100% - |C \u222a D|\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the concept of independent events, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nLet me see: Are owning cats and owning dogs independent events? I don't know; the problem doesn't specify. Maybe not; maybe there's some correlation between owning cats and dogs.\n\nGiven that, it's probably safer to stick with the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a table to represent the categories:\n\n- Own cats and own dogs: 15%\n\n- Own cats only: 30% - 15% = 15%\n\n- Own dogs only: 45% - 15% = 30%\n\n- Own neither: ?\n\nAdding up the percentages:\n\n15% (both) + 15% (cats only) + 30% (dogs only) = 60%\n\nSo, own neither: 100% - 60% = 40%\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe thinking about the total population.\n\nSuppose the town has 100 people for simplicity.\n\n- 30 own cats\n\n- 45 own dogs\n\n- 15 own both\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal pet owners = 30 + 45 - 15 = 60\n\nTherefore, people who own no pets = 100 - 60 = 40\n\nAgain, 40%.\n\nWait, but maybe some people own other pets, but the problem says \"own cats\", \"own dogs\", and \"own both\", but doesn't mention other pets. So, I'm assuming that the only pets considered are cats and dogs.\n\nTherefore, people who don't own cats or dogs own no pets, at least in terms of this problem.\n\nI think that's a safe assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if there were other pets, the problem might have mentioned them, but since it hasn't, I'll proceed with cats and dogs only.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the principle of probability.\n\nIf C is the event of owning a cat, and D is the event of owning a dog, then:\n\nP(C \u222a D) = P(C) + P(D) - P(C \u2229 D)\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nThen, the probability of owning neither is:\n\nP(neither) = 1 - P(C \u222a D)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(neither) = 1 - (0.30 + 0.45 - 0.15) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 or 40%\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways now.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a Venn diagram, I could visualize it.\n\nLet's say the total population is represented by a box, and inside are two circles: one for cat owners and one for dog owners.\n\nThe overlap between the two circles represents people who own both cats and dogs, which is 15%.\n\nThe part of the cat owners' circle that doesn't overlap is 30% - 15% = 15%.\n\nThe part of the dog owners' circle that doesn't overlap is 45% - 15% = 30%.\n\nAdding up the parts of the circles: 15% (only cats) + 30% (only dogs) + 15% (both) = 60%.\n\nTherefore, the area outside the circles, which represents people who don't own any pets, is 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nI can also consider using set differences.\n\nFor example, the number of people who own only cats is |C - D| = |C| - |C \u2229 D| = 30% - 15% = 15%.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own only dogs is |D - C| = |D| - |C \u2229 D| = 45% - 15% = 30%.\n\nThen, total pet owners are |C - D| + |D - C| + |C \u2229 D| = 15% + 30% + 15% = 60%.\n\nThus, no pets: 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nI think I've thoroughly confirmed that the answer is 40%.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation.\n\nIs there any chance that owning both pets is excluded in one of the categories? For example, maybe the 30% who own cats include those who also own dogs, and similarly for dogs.\n\nWait, no, typically, when such problems specify \"own cats\" and \"own dogs\", and \"own both\", it's understood that \"own both\" is a separate category.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \"own cats\" might include those who own both cats and dogs, but in standard set theory, if you say |C| = 30%, that includes those who own only cats and those who own both.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I used |C| = 30%, |D| = 45%, and |C \u2229 D| = 15%.\n\nThen, |C \u222a D| = |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D| = 30% + 45% - 15% = 60%.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if \"own cats\" means only those who own only cats, and \"own both\" is separate, then the calculations would differ.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the definitions.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"In a town, 30% of people own cats, 45% own dogs, and 15% own both cats and dogs.\"\n\nSo, \"own cats\" likely includes those who own only cats and those who own both cats and dogs.\n\nSimilarly, \"own dogs\" includes those who own only dogs and those who own both.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of people who own only cats, it's |C| - |C \u2229 D| = 30% - 15% = 15%.\n\nOnly dogs: |D| - |C \u2229 D| = 45% - 15% = 30%.\n\nBoth: 15%.\n\nTotal pet owners: 15% + 30% + 15% = 60%.\n\nNo pets: 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if \"own cats\" meant only those who own only cats, and \"own both\" is separate, then the total cat owners would be those who own only cats plus those who own both.\n\nBut in the problem, \"own cats\" includes both those who own only cats and those who own both cats and dogs.\n\nSimilarly for \"own dogs\".\n\nTherefore, my initial approach is correct.\n\nI think 40% is the right answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of people owning other types of pets affecting this calculation.\n\nThe problem specifies only cats and dogs, and the percentages given are for owning cats, dogs, and both.\n\nTherefore, the remainder should be those who own no pets.\n\nIf there were other pets, the problem might have mentioned them, but since it hasn't, I believe 40% is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the principle of_inclusion-exclusion for two sets.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|C \u222a D| = |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D|\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nThen, the percentage who own no pets is:\n\n100% - |C \u222a D| = 100% - (30% + 45% - 15%) = 100% - 60% = 40%\n\nConsistent again.\n\nI can also consider that in set theory, the union of cat owners and dog owners is the set of people who own at least one of the two pets.\n\nTherefore, the complement of that set is those who own no pets.\n\nSo, no pets = 100% - |C \u222a D| = 40%\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use probabilities, the probability that a person owns a cat is 0.30, owns a dog is 0.45, and owns both is 0.15.\n\nThen, the probability that a person owns either a cat or a dog is:\n\nP(C \u222a D) = P(C) + P(D) - P(C \u2229 D) = 0.30 + 0.45 - 0.15 = 0.60\n\nTherefore, the probability of owning no pets is:\n\n1 - P(C \u222a D) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 or 40%\n\nSame answer.\n\nI can also verify this using a contingency table.\n\nLet's make a table with categories:\n\n- Own cats and own dogs: 15%\n\n- Own cats only: 30% - 15% = 15%\n\n- Own dogs only: 45% - 15% = 30%\n\n- Own neither: ?\n\nTotal percentage must add up to 100%.\n\nSo, 15% (both) + 15% (cats only) + 30% (dogs only) + own neither = 100%\n\nTherefore, own neither = 100% - (15% + 15% + 30%) = 100% - 60% = 40%\n\nAgain, 40%.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in every possible way.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of people who do not own any pets is 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
