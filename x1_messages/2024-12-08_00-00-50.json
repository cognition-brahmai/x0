        "content": "So, let's tackle this car rental problem step by step. We've got a company with 50 cars, and they're rented out at an average rate of 80% per day. We need to find out how many cars will be available after 3 days, assuming no cars are returned during this time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"rented out at an average rate of 80% per day\" means. I think it means that each day, 80% of the total cars are rented out. So, everyday, 80% of the cars are being rented, and therefore, 20% are available.\n\nBut wait, that might not be exactly right. If 80% are rented each day, then the number of cars available each day would be 20% of the total cars. But since no cars are returned, the number of available cars shouldn't change from day to day, right? Or is there more to it?\n\nLet me think again. If 80% of the cars are rented each day, that means 20% are not rented and are available each day. So, every day, 20% of the cars are available. But since no cars are returned, the available cars remain the same each day.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. If cars are being rented out and not returned, then the number of available cars should decrease over time, right? Because the rented cars stay rented and aren't coming back.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's consider that each day, 80% of the total cars are rented out, and since they aren't returned, those cars are no longer available for rent on subsequent days.\n\nSo, starting with 50 cars:\n\n- On day 1: 80% of 50 cars are rented, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40 cars. So, 40 cars are rented out, and 10 cars are available.\n\n- On day 2: Now, only the remaining 10 cars are available. 80% of the total cars (which is still 50) are rented each day, but since 40 are already rented and not returned, only the remaining 10 can be rented. So, 80% of 10 cars would be rented, which is 0.8 * 10 = 8 cars. But wait, but according to the problem, they rent out 80% of the total cars each day, not 80% of the available cars.\n\nWait, maybe I need to interpret it as 80% of the total cars are rented each day, regardless of previous rentals. So, each day, they try to rent out 80% of the total cars, but if some are already rented, they can't rent them again.\n\nBut that seems confusing. Let's look at it another way.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that each day, the company attempts to rent out 80% of their total car fleet, but if cars are already rented out and not returned, they can't rent those again.\n\nSo, starting with 50 cars:\n\n- Day 1: They rent out 80% of 50, which is 40 cars. So, 40 cars are now rented, and 10 are available.\n\n- Day 2: They again try to rent out 80% of 50, which is again 40 cars. But since 40 cars are already rented and not returned, they can only rent out up to the number of available cars, which is 10. So, they rent out 10 cars, and now a total of 50 cars are rented (40 from day 1 and 10 from day 2), and 0 are available.\n\n- Day 3: Again, they try to rent out 80% of 50, which is 40 cars. But all cars are already rented and not returned, so they can't rent any more. Therefore, the number of available cars remains 0.\n\nSo, after 3 days, there are 0 cars available for rent.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this logic. The problem says \"they are rented out at an average rate of 80% per day, and no cars are returned during this period.\"\n\nSo, each day, they rent out 80% of their total cars, but if cars are already rented, they can't rent them again. So, the available cars decrease each day.\n\nStarting with 50 cars:\n\n- Day 1: Rent out 40 cars (80% of 50), leaving 10 available.\n\n- Day 2: Attempt to rent out 40 cars again, but only 10 are available, so they rent out those 10, totaling 50 rented cars.\n\n- Day 3: Attempt to rent out 40 cars, but none are available since all are already rented, so they rent out 0 cars.\n\nTherefore, after 3 days, all 50 cars are rented out, and 0 are available.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rental rate applies to the available cars each day. So, 80% of the available cars are rented each day.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\n- Day 1: 80% of 50 cars are rented, which is 40 cars, leaving 10 available.\n\n- Day 2: 80% of the remaining available cars (10) are rented, which is 8 cars, leaving 2 available.\n\n- Day 3: 80% of the remaining available cars (2) are rented, which is 1.6 cars, but since we can't have a fraction of a car, we'll round down to 1 car, leaving 1 available.\n\nSo, in this interpretation, after 3 days, 1 car is available.\n\nBut the problem says \"they are rented out at an average rate of 80% per day,\" which could be interpreted as renting 80% of the total cars each day, not 80% of the available cars.\n\nGiven that, the first interpretation seems more accurate, leading to 0 cars available after 3 days.\n\nHowever, in reality, if they rent out 80% of their total cars each day, and don't return them, eventually they will run out of cars to rent.\n\nSo, in this scenario, after 2 days, all cars are rented out.\n\nBut to be precise, let's consider the exact process:\n\n- Total cars: 50\n\n- Daily rental rate: 80% of total cars, which is 40 cars per day.\n\n- Day 1: Rent out 40 cars, leaving 10 available.\n\n- Day 2: Rent out another 40 cars, but only 10 are available, so they rent out the remaining 10, totaling 50 rented cars.\n\n- Day 3: Attempt to rent out 40 cars, but none are available, so they rent out 0 cars.\n\nTherefore, after 3 days, all 50 cars are rented out, and 0 are available.\n\nBut the problem mentions that no cars are returned during this period, which aligns with our calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 0 cars available after 3 days.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe the 80% rental rate is applied to the available cars each day, not the total cars.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\n- Day 1: 80% of 50 available cars are rented, which is 40 cars, leaving 10 available.\n\n- Day 2: 80% of the remaining 10 available cars are rented, which is 8 cars, leaving 2 available.\n\n- Day 3: 80% of the remaining 2 available cars are rented, which is 1.6 cars. Assuming they can't rent a fraction of a car, they rent out 1 car, leaving 1 available.\n\nSo, in this scenario, after 3 days, 1 car is available.\n\nBut the problem says \"they are rented out at an average rate of 80% per day,\" which seems to suggest that each day, 80% of the total cars are rented, not 80% of the available cars.\n\nTherefore, the first interpretation seems more accurate, leading to 0 cars available after 3 days.\n\nMoreover, in the first interpretation, the company attempts to rent out 80% of their total cars each day, but once cars are rented and not returned, the available cars decrease.\n\nSo, after day 1: 50 - 40 = 10 available.\n\nAfter day 2: 10 - 10 = 0 available.\n\nAfter day 3: 0 - 0 = 0 available.\n\nThus, after 3 days, 0 cars are available for rent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0 cars available.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
