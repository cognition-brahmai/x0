        "content": "So I've got this problem: \"In how many ways can you arrange the letters of the word 'PROBABILITY'?\" Okay, so I know that when you have a word, the number of ways to arrange its letters is related to permutations, right? But I also remember that if there are repeated letters, you have to account for that because otherwise, you'd be counting some arrangements multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many letters are in \"PROBABILITY.\" Let's see: P-R-O-B-A-B-I-L-I-T-Y. That's 11 letters. So, if all the letters were unique, the number of arrangements would be 11 factorial, which is 11!. But in this word, some letters repeat: there are two B's and two I's. So, to adjust for these repetitions, I need to divide the total number of permutations by the factorial of the number of times each letter repeats.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nTotal arrangements = 11! / (number of B's)! / (number of I's)! = 11! / 2! / 2!\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 11! is 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 39,916,800.\n\nThen, 2! is 2 \u00d7 1 = 2, and since there are two letters that each repeat twice (B and I), I need to divide by 2! for each.\n\nSo, total arrangements = 39,916,800 / 2 / 2 = 39,916,800 / 4 = 9,979,200.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. If there are two B's and two I's, then yes, I should divide by 2! for each set of repeats.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nTotal arrangements = 11! / (2! \u00d7 2!)\n\nWhich is the same as 11! divided by 4, since 2! \u00d7 2! = 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 39,916,800 divided by 4 is indeed 9,979,200.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's confirm if there are any other repeating letters. Let's list them out:\n\nP: 1\n\nR: 1\n\nO: 1\n\nB: 2\n\nA: 1\n\nB: 2 (but already counted)\n\nI: 2\n\nL: 1\n\nI: 2 (already counted)\n\nT: 1\n\nY: 1\n\nSo, only B and I repeat twice. No other letters repeat, so yes, dividing by 2! for B and 2! for I is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the letters in \"PROBABILITY\" is 9,979,200.\n\nWait, but I recall that sometimes with permutations of multiset, the formula is n! / (n1! \u00d7 n2! \u00d7 ... \u00d7 nk!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of the distinct items.\n\nIn this case, n = 11, n_B = 2, n_I = 2, and all others are 1. So, it should be 11! / (2! \u00d7 2!) = 9,979,200.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider that for each unique arrangement, there are 2! ways to arrange the B's and 2! ways to arrange the I's, but since they are indistinct, we need to divide by those factorials to eliminate the overcounting.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think 9,979,200 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try calculating it step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 11!:\n\n11! = 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 39,916,800.\n\nThen, calculate 2! for the B's and 2! for the I's:\n\n2! = 2\n\nSo, 2! \u00d7 2! = 4.\n\nNow, divide 39,916,800 by 4:\n\n39,916,800 \u00f7 4 = 9,979,200.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as selecting positions for each letter.\n\nFirst, choose positions for the B's: there are 11 positions, choose 2 for B's, which can be done in C(11,2) ways.\n\nThen, choose positions for the I's: there are 9 positions left, choose 2 for I's, which is C(9,2).\n\nThen, arrange the remaining 9 letters: P, R, O, A, L, T, Y, which are all unique, so that's 7! ways.\n\nWait, but that seems off because I have 11 letters, and after choosing positions for B's and I's, I have 7 positions left for the remaining 7 unique letters.\n\nWait, but in \"PROBABILITY\", there are 11 letters: P,R,O,B,A,B,I,L,I,T,Y.\n\nSo, unique letters are P,R,O,B,A,I,L,T,Y, but B and I are repeated twice.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nTotal arrangements = 11! / (2! \u00d7 2!) = 9,979,200.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to break it down:\n\nFirst, choose positions for the B's: C(11,2).\n\nThen, choose positions for the I's from the remaining 9 positions: C(9,2).\n\nThen, arrange the remaining 7 unique letters in the remaining 7 positions: 7!.\n\nSo, total arrangements = C(11,2) \u00d7 C(9,2) \u00d7 7!.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nC(11,2) = 55\n\nC(9,2) = 36\n\n7! = 5,040\n\nSo, 55 \u00d7 36 = 1,980\n\n1,980 \u00d7 5,040 = 1,980 \u00d7 5,000 = 9,900,000 + 1,980 \u00d7 40 = 9,900,000 + 79,200 = 9,979,200.\n\nWait, that's the same answer as before!\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the total number of distinct arrangements is 9,979,200.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9,979,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9979200} \\]"
