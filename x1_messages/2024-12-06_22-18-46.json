        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains: one leaving from station A going towards station B, and the other leaving from station B going towards station A. The distance between A and B is 200 miles. The first train is going at 50 miles per hour, and the second one at 70 miles per hour. I need to find out how far apart they are when they meet.\n\nWait, actually, if they're moving towards each other, they'll meet at some point between A and B, and at that point, the distance between them should be zero, right? So maybe the question is asking how far each train has traveled when they meet, or perhaps how much time it takes for them to meet. But the question specifically says \"how far apart are the two trains when they meet.\" If they meet, aren't they at the same point, so the distance apart is zero?\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A train leaves from station A heading towards station B, which is 200 miles away. The train travels at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour. At the same time, another train leaves from station B heading towards station A, traveling at a constant speed of 70 miles per hour. How far apart are the two trains when they meet?\"\n\nOkay, so they're moving towards each other, starting from 200 miles apart. They're moving at constant speeds, 50 mph and 70 mph respectively. The question is, when they meet, how far apart are they?\n\nAgain, if they're moving towards each other, the distance between them is decreasing at a rate equal to the sum of their speeds, because they're moving towards each other. So the relative speed is 50 + 70 = 120 miles per hour.\n\nSo, the time it takes for them to meet is the initial distance divided by the relative speed, which is 200 miles divided by 120 miles per hour, which is 200/120 = 1.666... hours, or 1 and 2/3 hours.\n\nNow, in that time, the first train, going at 50 mph, would have traveled 50 * 1.666... = 83.333... miles.\n\nThe second train, going at 70 mph, would have traveled 70 * 1.666... = 116.666... miles.\n\nAnd the sum of these distances should be equal to the initial distance between A and B, which is 200 miles. Let's check: 83.333... + 116.666... = 200 miles. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut the question is, how far apart are they when they meet. If they've covered the entire 200 miles between them, and they meet, then the distance apart should be zero.\n\nMaybe the question is worded incorrectly, or perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe it's asking for the distance each train has traveled when they meet, or the location where they meet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and there's something else going on.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Let's denote the distance from station A to the meeting point as x miles. Then, the distance from station B to the meeting point would be 200 - x miles.\n\nThe time taken by the first train to travel x miles is x / 50 hours.\n\nThe time taken by the second train to travel 200 - x miles is (200 - x) / 70 hours.\n\nSince they leave at the same time and meet at the same time, these times should be equal.\n\nSo, x / 50 = (200 - x) / 70.\n\nNow, solving for x:\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n70x = 50(200 - x)\n\n70x = 10000 - 50x\n\n70x + 50x = 10000\n\n120x = 10000\n\nx = 10000 / 120\n\nx = 83.333... miles.\n\nSo, the first train has traveled 83.333... miles when they meet.\n\nSimilarly, the second train has traveled 200 - 83.333... = 116.666... miles.\n\nAgain, the distance apart when they meet should be zero, since they've met.\n\nMaybe the question is asking for the distance each has traveled, or the location of the meeting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about how far apart they are at a certain time before they meet.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should look at the problem differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider their relative speed. Since they are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 50 + 70 = 120 mph.\n\nThe initial distance is 200 miles.\n\nThe time to meet is distance divided by relative speed: 200 / 120 = 1.666... hours.\n\nIn that time, the first train travels 50 * 1.666... = 83.333... miles.\n\nThe second train travels 70 * 1.666... = 116.666... miles.\n\nThe sum is 200 miles, which matches the initial distance.\n\nTherefore, when they meet, the distance between them is zero.\n\nPerhaps the question is misphrased, and it actually wants to know how far each train has traveled when they meet, or the position of the meeting point relative to one of the stations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the distance apart at a specific time, but it specifies \"when they meet,\" which should be zero.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the concept of \"meeting.\" When two objects move towards each other, they meet when they reach the same point at the same time, meaning the distance between them is zero.\n\nUnless perhaps there's a delay or something, but the problem doesn't mention any such thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup, and the trains are actually not moving towards each other, but in the same direction or something.\n\nBut according to the problem, they're heading towards each other.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose the train from A is going to B at 50 mph, and the train from B is going to A at 70 mph, starting at the same time.\n\nThe distance between A and B is 200 miles.\n\nThe question is, how far apart are they when they meet.\n\nIf they're moving towards each other, the time to meet is 200 / (50 + 70) = 200 / 120 = 1.666... hours, as previously calculated.\n\nIn that time, the first train has gone 50 * 1.666... = 83.333... miles, and the second train has gone 70 * 1.666... = 116.666... miles.\n\nSince they've covered the entire 200 miles between them, they should meet with zero distance apart.\n\nAlternatively, if they were moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be 70 - 50 = 20 mph, and the time to meet would be 200 / 20 = 10 hours, but the problem specifies they're heading towards each other.\n\nI think the answer should be that they are zero miles apart when they meet.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the distance between them at the time they meet, considering some other factor, but without additional information, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the word \"meet.\" Maybe it doesn't mean they've reached the same point.\n\nBut in standard terminology, \"meet\" in the context of two objects moving towards each other means they are at the same point at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the distance between them when they meet should be zero.\n\nI think the answer is zero miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
