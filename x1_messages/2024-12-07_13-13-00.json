        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (3^2 * 5) / (15 - 6). First, I need to calculate the exponent, then multiplication and division, and finally subtraction. Wait, no, I think I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n15 - 6 = 9\n\nNow the expression becomes (3^2 * 5) / 9.\n\nNext, calculate the exponent:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nSo now it's (9 * 5) / 9.\n\nThen, perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n9 * 5 = 45\n\nNow it's 45 / 9.\n\nFinally, divide:\n\n45 / 9 = 5\n\nSo the answer should be 5.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, parentheses: 15 - 6 is indeed 9.\n\nNext, exponent: 3^2 is 9.\n\nThen, multiplication: 9 * 5 is 45.\n\nLastly, division: 45 / 9 is 5.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
