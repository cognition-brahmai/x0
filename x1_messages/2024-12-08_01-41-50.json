        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. I have a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and I'm drawing five cards from it without replacement. I need to find the probability that exactly three of those cards are kings and two are queens. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that in a standard deck, there are 4 kings and 4 queens. So, I need to draw exactly three kings and two queens out of the five cards I'm drawing.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to use combinations because the order in which I draw the cards doesn't matter here. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, and since it's without replacement, each card drawn affects the probabilities of the next draws.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw five cards from 52 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{52}{5}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to the order.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable combinations, which is drawing exactly three kings and two queens.\n\nThe number of ways to choose three kings from four is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose two queens from four is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of favorable combinations should be the product of these two, because these are independent choices:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable combinations} = \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\n\\]\n\nThen, the probability is the number of favorable combinations divided by the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly three kings and two queens}) = \\frac{\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}}{\\binom{52}{5}}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate these values step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of favorable combinations is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\(\\binom{52}{5}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = \\frac{52!}{5! \\times 47!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating factorials of large numbers like 52 is impractical, but we can simplify this:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{311,875,200}{120} = 2,598,960\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems too small. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nHmm, let's see. The total number of combinations \\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\) seems correct.\n\nAnd \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\), \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), so \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290} \\).\n\nActually, that doesn't seem right because the probability feels too low. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me consider whether there are any other constraints or if I miscounted the favorable combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that after drawing three kings and two queens, there are no restrictions on the remaining cards, but in this case, since I'm specifying exactly three kings and two queens, and there are only four kings and four queens, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that there are 5 cards being drawn, and I'm specifying exactly three kings and two queens, so no other ranks are allowed in those five cards.\n\nWait, actually, in a standard deck, there are 13 ranks: ace, 2 through 10, jack, queen, king.\n\nBut in this problem, I'm only concerned with drawing kings and queens, specifically three kings and two queens.\n\nBut, in a deck, there are only four kings and four queens, totaling eight cards that are either king or queen.\n\nSo, if I'm drawing five cards, and I want exactly three kings and two queens, and there are only eight such cards in total, then perhaps I should be considering combinations from these eight cards.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because there are other cards in the deck that aren't kings or queens, but since I'm specifying that I want exactly three kings and two queens, the other cards shouldn't matter as long as they aren't kings or queens.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm drawing only five cards, and I'm specifying exactly three kings and two queens, I need to make sure that the remaining cards are not kings or queens.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I considered only the combinations of three kings from four and two queens from four, and divided by the total combinations of five cards from 52.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that the remaining cards cannot be kings or queens.\n\nWait, actually, in my initial calculation, I only considered the combinations of three kings and two queens, assuming that the remaining cards are neither kings nor queens.\n\nBut in reality, since I'm drawing exactly five cards, and specifying that three are kings and two are queens, it implies that the other cards in the hand are not kings or queens.\n\nBut in a standard deck, there are 52 cards total, with 4 kings and 4 queens, leaving 44 cards that are neither kings nor queens.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider that in my favorable combinations.\n\nWait, no. In my initial calculation, \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) chooses three kings from four, \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) chooses two queens from four, and since I'm drawing five cards in total, and specifying exactly three kings and two queens, the remaining cards must be neither kings nor queens.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I didn't account for the remaining cards, because I assumed that by specifying exactly three kings and two queens, the remaining cards are automatically not kings or queens.\n\nBut perhaps I need to make sure that the remaining cards are indeed not kings or queens.\n\nWait, actually, in my initial calculation, \\(\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\) gives the number of ways to choose three kings and two queens, and since I'm drawing five cards in total, this should be the number of favorable hands.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider that the remaining 52 - 4 kings - 4 queens = 44 cards are neither kings nor queens.\n\nBut in my initial approach, since I'm only choosing three kings and two queens, and drawing five cards in total, it implies that there are no other kings or queens in the hand.\n\nWait, but actually, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nTotal ways to choose three kings from four: \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n\nTotal ways to choose two queens from four: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n\nTotal ways to choose five cards from 52: \\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nSo, probability = \\(\\frac{4 \\times 6}{2,598,960} = \\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nBut, to cross-verify, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step, considering the probability of drawing a king or a queen in each step without replacement.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing three kings and two queens in a specific order.\n\nFor example, king first, then king, then king, then queen, then queen.\n\nThe probability of that specific sequence would be:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} \\times \\frac{2}{50} \\times \\frac{4}{49} \\times \\frac{3}{48}\\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{49}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{48} = \\frac{1}{16}\\)\n\nSo, multiplying them together:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{17} \\times \\frac{1}{25} \\times \\frac{4}{49} \\times \\frac{1}{16}\\)\n\nThat seems very small.\n\nBut wait, that's just for one specific sequence. Since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible sequences where three are kings and two are queens.\n\nThe number of such sequences is the number of ways to arrange three kings and two queens in five positions, which is \\(\\frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10\\)\n\nSo, total probability would be \\(10 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{17} \\times \\frac{1}{25} \\times \\frac{4}{49} \\times \\frac{1}{16} \\right)\\)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, calculate the product inside the parentheses:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{17} = \\frac{1}{221}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{221} \\times \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{1}{5,525}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{5,525} \\times \\frac{4}{49} = \\frac{4}{269,725}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{269,725} \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{4,315,600} = \\frac{1}{1,078,900}\\)\n\nThen, multiply by 10:\n\n\\(10 \\times \\frac{1}{1,078,900} = \\frac{10}{1,078,900} = \\frac{1}{107,890}\\)\n\nBut this is different from my initial calculation of \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nLet me check the combination approach again.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose three kings from four: \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n\nTotal number of ways to choose two queens from four: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n\nTotal number of ways to choose five cards from 52: \\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nSo, probability = \\(\\frac{4 \\times 6}{2,598,960} = \\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nBut according to the step-by-step approach, I got \\(\\frac{1}{107,890}\\)\n\nThere's a slight difference here. Maybe I made an error in one of the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the combination approach is more accurate in this case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that there are overlapping counts or something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the remaining cards cannot be kings or queens.\n\nWait, no, in the combination approach, by specifying exactly three kings and two queens, I'm implicitly excluding the possibility of having more kings or queens in the hand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the hypergeometric distribution formula.\n\nThe hypergeometric distribution is used to calculate the probability of k successes (in this case, kings and queens) in n draws (5 cards) from a finite population (52 cards) without replacement.\n\nThe formula for hypergeometric probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\times \\binom{N - K}{n - k}}{\\binom{N}{n}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (52 cards)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (4 kings + 4 queens = 8)\n\n- n is the number of draws (5 cards)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (3 kings and 2 queens)\n\nWait, but in this case, I have two specific types of successes: kings and queens.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as drawing three kings, two queens, and zero others.\n\nBut, in reality, since I'm specifying exactly three kings and two queens, and there are only eight kings and queens in total, I need to make sure that the remaining cards are not kings or queens.\n\nWait, but in my initial combination approach, I only considered choosing three kings and two queens, which implicitly excludes any other kings or queens beyond those three and two.\n\nBut perhaps I need to explicitly account for the remaining cards being neither kings nor queens.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose three kings from four: \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n\nTotal number of ways to choose two queens from four: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n\nTotal number of ways to choose zero kings from the remaining one king: \\(\\binom{0}{0} = 1\\) (since I've already chosen three out of four kings)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. There's still one king left, but since I'm choosing exactly three kings, I'm not choosing that last king.\n\nSimilarly, for queens, I'm choosing two out of four, so two queens are left unpicked.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the remaining cards in the hand are not kings or queens.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose the remaining five - 3 - 2 = 0 cards from the non-kings and non-queens.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 5 - 3 - 2 = 0, which implies that all five cards are accounted for by the three kings and two queens, with no room for other cards.\n\nBut in reality, since I'm drawing five cards, and specifying exactly three kings and two queens, there are no other cards in the hand.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the total number of ways to choose three kings from four, two queens from four, and zero other cards from the remaining 44 cards.\n\nSo, the number of favorable combinations would be:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{44}{0} = 4 \\times 6 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nAnd the total number of combinations remains \\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nSo, the probability is still \\(\\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nBut earlier, when I tried the step-by-step approach, I got \\(\\frac{1}{107,890}\\)\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a calculation error in the step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me re-examine that.\n\nThe probability for one specific sequence: king, king, king, queen, queen.\n\nProbability:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} \\times \\frac{2}{50} \\times \\frac{4}{49} \\times \\frac{3}{48}\\)\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{49}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{48} = \\frac{1}{16}\\)\n\nNow, multiplying these together:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{17} = \\frac{1}{221}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{221} \\times \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{1}{5,525}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{5,525} \\times \\frac{4}{49} = \\frac{4}{269,725}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{269,725} \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{4,315,600} = \\frac{1}{1,078,900}\\)\n\nNow, there are \\(\\frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10\\) such sequences.\n\nSo, total probability is \\(10 \\times \\frac{1}{1,078,900} = \\frac{10}{1,078,900} = \\frac{1}{107,890}\\)\n\nBut according to the combination approach, it's \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nThese two results are slightly different, which suggests that I might have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a rounding error or something.\n\nLet me check the combination approach again.\n\n\\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n\n\\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n\n\\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{4 \\times 6}{2,598,960} = \\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate \\(\\binom{52}{5}\\) again to make sure.\n\n\\(\\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{311,875,200}{120} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, in the step-by-step approach, I got \\(\\frac{1}{107,890}\\), which is slightly different from \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nMaybe the difference is due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps.\n\nLet me calculate the step-by-step approach more precisely.\n\nCalculate the product:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} \\times \\frac{2}{50} \\times \\frac{4}{49} \\times \\frac{3}{48}\\)\n\nFirst, simplify each fraction:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{49}\\) (can't simplify further)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{48} = \\frac{1}{16}\\)\n\nNow, multiply them together:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{17} = \\frac{1}{221}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{221} \\times \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{1}{5,525}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{5,525} \\times \\frac{4}{49} = \\frac{4}{269,725}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{269,725} \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{4,315,600} = \\frac{1}{1,078,900}\\)\n\nNow, there are 10 such sequences, so total probability is \\(10 \\times \\frac{1}{1,078,900} = \\frac{10}{1,078,900} = \\frac{1}{107,890}\\)\n\nBut according to the combination approach, it's \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nThere's still a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the order in which I draw the cards matters in the step-by-step approach, but since it's a combination problem, order doesn't matter, so the combination approach should be the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the step-by-step calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that after drawing three kings and two queens, there might be overlapping possibilities or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the combination approach, as it directly gives the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes, which seems more straightforward for this problem.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the combination approach, which gives \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check the total number of ways to choose three kings and two queens.\n\nThere are four kings, choose three: \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n\nFour queens, choose two: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n\nSo, favorable combinations: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n\nTotal combinations: \\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nThus, probability: \\(\\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that there are overlaps or dependencies in the step-by-step approach that I'm not accounting for.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this, and considering that the combination approach is more straightforward and is commonly used for such problems, I'll conclude that the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, I can look up a similar problem or see if there's a formula for this specific scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the hypergeometric distribution.\n\nThe hypergeometric distribution formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\times \\binom{N - K}{n - k}}{\\binom{N}{n}}\n\\]\n\nIn this case:\n\n- N = 52 (total cards)\n\n- K = 8 (total kings and queens)\n\n- n = 5 (cards drawn)\n\n- k = 5 (since we're drawing 5 cards that are either kings or queens, but in this specific problem, we want exactly three kings and two queens)\n\nWait, but in the hypergeometric distribution, k is the number of successes, which in this case would be the number of kings and queens.\n\nBut in our problem, we're specifying the exact number of each type: three kings and two queens.\n\nSo, perhaps the hypergeometric distribution isn't directly applicable here, or I need to adjust it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider two separate hypergeometric distributions: one for kings and one for queens.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as first choosing three kings from four, and then choosing two queens from four, and then dividing by the total number of ways to choose five cards from 52.\n\nWhich is essentially what I did in the combination approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a multinomial coefficient involved here.\n\nYes, thinking in terms of multinomial coefficients might be more appropriate.\n\nThe multinomial coefficient formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_m} = \\frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \\dots k_m!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, I'm dividing the five cards into three categories: kings, queens, and others.\n\nSo, I have:\n\n- k1 = 3 (kings)\n\n- k2 = 2 (queens)\n\n- k3 = 0 (others)\n\nBut since I'm drawing five cards, and specifying exactly three kings and two queens, the remaining cards should be neither kings nor queens, but in this case, since 3 + 2 = 5, there are no other cards.\n\nSo, the multinomial coefficient would be:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3, 2, 0} = \\frac{5!}{3! 2! 0!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to the number of sequences where three are kings and two are queens.\n\nBut in the combination approach, I already considered the number of ways to choose three kings and two queens, which is \\(\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n\nWait, but in the multinomial coefficient approach, the probability would be:\n\n\\[\nP = \\binom{5}{3,2,0} \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{52} \\right)^3 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{52} \\right)^2 \\times \\left( \\frac{44}{52} \\right)^0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nP = 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{52} \\right)^3 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{52} \\right)^2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{52} \\right)^3 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{52} \\right)^2 = 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{52} \\right)^5\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the probabilities for each draw aren't independent; it's without replacement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the multinomial coefficient approach isn't suitable for without replacement scenarios.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should stick with the combination approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nThe number of ways to choose three kings from four, and two queens from four, and zero others from 44.\n\nSo, the number of favorable combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{44}{0} = 4 \\times 6 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nAnd the total number of combinations is \\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the queens and kings are distinct groups, and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, since I'm dealing with specific counts of each, the combination approach seems appropriate.\n\nGiven that, and considering the time I've spent on this, I'll conclude that the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can look up a similar problem or see if there's a standard formula for this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of permutations.\n\nIf I consider the order in which the cards are drawn, then the number of favorable permutations would be:\n\nNumber of ways to arrange three kings and two queens in five positions: \\(\\frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10\\)\n\nThen, for each specific arrangement, the probability is:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} \\times \\frac{2}{50} \\times \\frac{4}{49} \\times \\frac{3}{48}\\)\n\nWhich is the same as in the step-by-step approach.\n\nSo, total probability would be \\(10 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} \\times \\frac{2}{50} \\times \\frac{4}{49} \\times \\frac{3}{48} \\right)\\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{49}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{48} = \\frac{1}{16}\\)\n\nSo, multiplying them together:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{17} = \\frac{1}{221}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{221} \\times \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{1}{5,525}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{5,525} \\times \\frac{4}{49} = \\frac{4}{269,725}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{269,725} \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{4,315,600} = \\frac{1}{1,078,900}\\)\n\nThen, \\(10 \\times \\frac{1}{1,078,900} = \\frac{10}{1,078,900} = \\frac{1}{107,890}\\)\n\nBut this differs from the combination approach's result of \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nThere's still a discrepancy here, and I need to resolve it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate both denominators to see where the error lies.\n\nIn the combination approach:\n\n\\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nIn the step-by-step approach:\n\n\\(\\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5!} = \\frac{311,875,200}{120} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nWait, that's the same as the combination approach.\n\nSo, why is there a difference in the final probabilities?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me recalculate the step-by-step approach carefully.\n\nProbability for one specific sequence:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} \\times \\frac{2}{50} \\times \\frac{4}{49} \\times \\frac{3}{48}\\)\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{3}{663} = \\frac{1}{221}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{221} \\times \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{2}{11,050} = \\frac{1}{5,525}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{5,525} \\times \\frac{4}{49} = \\frac{4}{269,725}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{269,725} \\times \\frac{3}{48} = \\frac{12}{12,947,000} = \\frac{1}{1,078,916.\\overline{6}}\\)\n\nSo, the probability for one specific sequence is approximately \\(\\frac{1}{1,078,916.666}\\)\n\nThen, multiplying by 10 for the number of sequences:\n\n\\(10 \\times \\frac{1}{1,078,916.666} = \\frac{10}{1,078,916.666} = \\frac{1}{107,891.666}\\)\n\nWhich is approximately \\(\\frac{1}{107,890}\\)\n\nBut according to the combination approach, it's \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nThere's still a discrepancy, and I need to figure out why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the combination approach more accurately.\n\n\\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n\n\\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n\n\\(\\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{4 \\times 6}{2,598,960} = \\frac{24}{2,598,960} = \\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the step-by-step approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that after drawing three kings and two queens, there are no cards left to draw, so the remaining \\(\\binom{44}{0}\\) is 1, which is already accounted for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the combination approach is more accurate, and the step-by-step approach has a miscalculation.\n\nGiven that, I'll trust the combination approach, which gives \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly three kings and two queens in a five-card hand from a standard 52-card deck is \\(\\frac{1}{108,290}\\)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{108290}}"
