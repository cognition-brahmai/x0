        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a square with a side length of 10 units, and inside it, there's a circle with the maximum possible diameter. I need to find the area of the shaded region between the square and the circle.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. There's a square, each side is 10 units long. And inside this square, there's a circle that's as big as it can be. That means the circle must touch all four sides of the square, right? So, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the side length of the square.\n\nWait, but does that make sense? If the circle is inscribed in the square, meaning it touches all four sides, then yes, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the side length of the square. So, in this case, the diameter of the circle is 10 units.\n\nNow, to find the area of the shaded region between the square and the circle, I need to subtract the area of the circle from the area of the square.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the square. The area of a square is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of square} = \\text{side}^2\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in the side length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of square} = 10^2 = 100 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the area of the circle. The area of a circle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle} = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nBut I have the diameter, which is 10 units, so the radius \\( r \\) is half of that, which is 5 units.\n\nSo, plugging in the radius:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle} = \\pi (5)^2 = 25\\pi \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the shaded area, which is the area between the square and the circle, I subtract the area of the circle from the area of the square:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Shaded area} = \\text{Area of square} - \\text{Area of circle} = 100 - 25\\pi\n\\]\n\nThat's the exact value. If I need a numerical approximation, I can use the value of \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Shaded area} \\approx 100 - 25 \\times 3.1416 = 100 - 78.54 = 21.46 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify to use an approximation for \\( \\pi \\), I'll leave the answer in terms of \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Shaded area} = 100 - 25\\pi \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nJust to double-check, I'll make sure that the circle is indeed inscribed in the square, meaning its diameter equals the side length of the square. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the circle was circumscribed around the square, meaning the square touches the circle at its corners, then the diameter of the circle would be equal to the diagonal of the square. But in this problem, it says the circle has the maximum possible diameter inside the square, which should be equal to the side length of the square.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nIf the circle is inscribed in the square, it touches all four sides, and its diameter is equal to the side length of the square. But if the circle is circumscribed around the square, meaning the square's corners touch the circle, then the diameter of the circle would be equal to the diagonal of the square.\n\nBut the problem says \"inside the square with the maximum possible diameter,\" which should mean the circle is inscribed in the square, so diameter equal to the side length.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: circle inscribed in the square.\n\n- Diameter of circle = side length of square = 10 units\n\n- Area of square = 100 square units\n\n- Area of circle = 25\u03c0 square units\n\n- Shaded area = 100 - 25\u03c0 square units\n\nSecond scenario: circle circumscribed around the square.\n\n- Diagonal of square = side length \u00d7 \u221a2 = 10\u221a2 units\n\n- Diameter of circle = 10\u221a2 units\n\n- Radius of circle = (10\u221a2)/2 = 5\u221a2 units\n\n- Area of circle = \u03c0(5\u221a2)^2 = \u03c0(25 \u00d7 2) = 50\u03c0 square units\n\n- Shaded area = area of square - area of circle = 100 - 50\u03c0 square units\n\nBut in this case, the circle circumscribed around the square would have a larger diameter than the side length, which might not be considered the \"maximum possible diameter inside the square.\" The first scenario seems more appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions the \"shaded region between the square and the circle,\" which suggests that the circle is inside the square, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is correct.\n\nSo, the area of the shaded region is 100 - 25\u03c0 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 - 25\\pi} \\]\n"
