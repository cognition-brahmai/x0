        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a residential complex with 500 apartment units. Each unit has an average floor area of 1,000 square feet. Out of this area, 60% is covered with hardwood flooring and 40% with carpeting. We need to find out the total amount of hardwood and carpeting materials required for the entire project.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much floor area in each unit is covered with hardwood and how much with carpeting.\n\nGiven that each unit is 1,000 square feet and 60% of that is hardwood, I can calculate the hardwood area per unit by multiplying 1,000 by 60%.\n\nSimilarly, for carpeting, which is 40% of the floor area, I'll multiply 1,000 by 40%.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nHardwood per unit = 1,000 sq ft * 60% = 1,000 * 0.60 = 600 sq ft\n\nCarpeting per unit = 1,000 sq ft * 40% = 1,000 * 0.40 = 400 sq ft\n\nSo, each unit requires 600 square feet of hardwood and 400 square feet of carpeting.\n\nNow, since there are 500 units, I need to multiply these amounts by 500 to get the total for the entire project.\n\nTotal hardwood needed = 600 sq ft/unit * 500 units = 300,000 sq ft\n\nTotal carpeting needed = 400 sq ft/unit * 500 units = 200,000 sq ft\n\nTherefore, the construction company needs 300,000 square feet of hardwood and 200,000 square feet of carpeting for the entire project.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, percentage calculations:\n\n60% of 1,000 sq ft is indeed 600 sq ft, and 40% is 400 sq ft. That seems correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by the number of units:\n\n600 sq ft/unit * 500 units = 300,000 sq ft\n\n400 sq ft/unit * 500 units = 200,000 sq ft\n\nYes, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total floor area for all units first and then apply the percentages.\n\nTotal floor area for all units = 1,000 sq ft/unit * 500 units = 500,000 sq ft\n\nThen, hardwood is 60% of 500,000 sq ft:\n\nHardwood = 500,000 * 0.60 = 300,000 sq ft\n\nCarpeting is 40% of 500,000 sq ft:\n\nCarpeting = 500,000 * 0.40 = 200,000 sq ft\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident about the results.\n\nIt's also worth considering if there's any waste or extra materials needed, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll assume that the amounts calculated are sufficient.\n\nMoreover, in real-world scenarios, construction companies often order extra materials to account for waste, cuts, and potential errors. However, based on the information provided, the total required materials are 300,000 sq ft of hardwood and 200,000 sq ft of carpeting.\n\nIn summary, the construction company needs to procure 300,000 square feet of hardwood and 200,000 square feet of carpeting for the residential complex project.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300,000 \\text{ square feet of hardwood and } 200,000 \\text{ square feet of carpeting}} \\]"
