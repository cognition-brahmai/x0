        "content": "If a lizard loses its tail, it undergoes a process called autotomy, where it voluntarily sheds its tail as a defense mechanism to escape predators. The lost tail can regrow over time, although the new tail may differ in coloration and length from the original one. This regeneration process varies among different lizard species and can take several weeks to months to complete."
