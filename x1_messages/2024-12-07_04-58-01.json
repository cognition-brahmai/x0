        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 100 units per day, and each unit takes 30 minutes to produce. The factory operates 10 hours a day. I need to find out how many machines the factory has.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much production time is needed for 100 units. Since each unit takes 30 minutes, 100 units would take 100 * 30 = 3000 minutes.\n\nNow, the factory operates for 10 hours a day. I need to convert that into minutes because the production time is in minutes. So, 10 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 600 minutes per day.\n\nIf the factory has multiple machines working simultaneously, the total production time per day would be the number of machines multiplied by the operating time per machine per day.\n\nLet me denote the number of machines as M.\n\nSo, total production time per day = M * 600 minutes.\n\nThis total production time should be equal to the required production time for 100 units, which is 3000 minutes.\n\nTherefore, M * 600 = 3000.\n\nNow, solving for M: M = 3000 / 600 = 5.\n\nSo, the factory has 5 machines.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf each machine works for 10 hours a day, and each unit takes 30 minutes to produce, then each machine can produce 10 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 30 minutes/unit = 20 units per day.\n\nWith 5 machines, the total production would be 5 * 20 = 100 units per day, which matches the given information.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
