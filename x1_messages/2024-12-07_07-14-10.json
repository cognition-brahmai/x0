        "content": "So John bought 7 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 12 pencils. He also bought 8 individual pencils. I need to find out the total number of pencils he bought.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate how many pencils are in the 7 packs. Since each pack has 12 pencils, I can multiply the number of packs by the number of pencils per pack:\n\n7 packs * 12 pencils per pack = 84 pencils\n\nNow, he also bought 8 individual pencils. So, I need to add those to the total from the packs:\n\n84 pencils + 8 pencils = 92 pencils\n\nTherefore, John bought a total of 92 pencils.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{92} \\]"
