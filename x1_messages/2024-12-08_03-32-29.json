        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 500 widgets per day, and it operates 5 days a week. We need to find out how many widgets it produces in a year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many widgets are produced in a week. Since the factory operates 5 days a week and produces 500 widgets each day, I can multiply the daily production by the number of operating days in a week:\n\n500 widgets/day \u00d7 5 days/week = 2,500 widgets/week\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, to find out the annual production, I need to know how many weeks there are in a year. Typically, there are 52 weeks in a year. So, if the factory produces 2,500 widgets each week, then over 52 weeks, the total production would be:\n\n2,500 widgets/week \u00d7 52 weeks/year = 130,000 widgets/year\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider whether the factory operates all 52 weeks without any breaks. The problem doesn't specify any shut downs or holidays, so I'll assume it operates consistently throughout the year.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the annual production by first finding out how many days the factory operates in a year. Since it operates 5 days a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of operating days in a year would be:\n\n5 days/week \u00d7 52 weeks/year = 260 days/year\n\nThen, multiplying the daily production by the number of operating days in a year:\n\n500 widgets/day \u00d7 260 days/year = 130,000 widgets/year\n\nHmm, I get the same result again. That gives me more confidence that 130,000 is the correct annual production.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, does the factory operate every week of the year, including holidays? The problem doesn't mention any shut downs for maintenance or holidays, so I'll assume it runs continuously.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any leap years that might add an extra day. However, since the factory operates only 5 days a week, and February 29th would be a specific day of the week, it might or might not be an operating day. But for simplicity, and since the problem doesn't specify, I'll ignore the leap year complication.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory's production rate remains constant throughout the year. The problem states that it produces 500 widgets per day, so I'll assume that rate is consistent.\n\nGiven all that, I think 130,000 widgets per year is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{130000} \\]"
