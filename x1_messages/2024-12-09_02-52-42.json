        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about houses and windows in a small town. There are two types of houses: single-story and double-story. It says that 60% of the houses are single-story, and each single-story house has 4 windows. Double-story houses have 7 windows each. I need to find out what percentage of the total windows in the town belong to single-story houses.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I have the percentages of house types and the number of windows per house type. I need to find the percentage of total windows that come from single-story houses.\n\nMaybe I should start by assuming a total number of houses to make this easier. Let's say there are 100 houses in the town. That way, the percentages will directly translate into numbers of houses.\n\nSo, if there are 100 houses:\n\n- Single-story houses: 60% of 100 = 60 houses\n\n- Double-story houses: 100 - 60 = 40 houses\n\nNow, each single-story house has 4 windows, so the total number of windows from single-story houses is:\n\n60 houses * 4 windows/house = 240 windows\n\nEach double-story house has 7 windows, so the total number of windows from double-story houses is:\n\n40 houses * 7 windows/house = 280 windows\n\nNow, the total number of windows in the town is:\n\n240 windows (from single-story) + 280 windows (from double-story) = 520 windows\n\nI need to find what percentage 240 windows is of the total 520 windows.\n\nTo find this percentage, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{240}{520} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, divide 240 by 520:\n\n240 \u00f7 520 = 0.4615 (approximately)\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.4615 \u00d7 100 = 46.15%\n\nSo, approximately 46.15% of the total windows belong to single-story houses.\n\nBut maybe I can simplify this without assuming a specific number of houses. Let's try that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of houses as H.\n\nThen:\n\n- Single-story houses: 0.6H\n\n- Double-story houses: 0.4H\n\nTotal windows from single-story houses: 0.6H * 4 = 2.4H\n\nTotal windows from double-story houses: 0.4H * 7 = 2.8H\n\nTotal windows in the town: 2.4H + 2.8H = 5.2H\n\nPercentage of windows from single-story houses:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{2.4H}{5.2H} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{2.4}{5.2} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSimplify 2.4 divided by 5.2:\n\n2.4 \u00f7 5.2 = 0.4615 (same as before)\n\nSo, again, it's approximately 46.15%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check if the ratio changes with different total numbers of houses. Let\u2019s try with, say, 200 houses.\n\n- Single-story: 60% of 200 = 120 houses\n\n- Double-story: 40% of 200 = 80 houses\n\n- Windows from single-story: 120 * 4 = 480\n\n- Windows from double-story: 80 * 7 = 560\n\n- Total windows: 480 + 560 = 1040\n\n- Percentage from single-story: (480 / 1040) * 100 = 46.15%\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, with 50 houses:\n\n- Single-story: 60% of 50 = 30 houses\n\n- Double-story: 40% of 50 = 20 houses\n\n- Windows from single-story: 30 * 4 = 120\n\n- Windows from double-story: 20 * 7 = 140\n\n- Total windows: 120 + 140 = 260\n\n- Percentage from single-story: (120 / 260) * 100 = 46.15%\n\nAgain, the same percentage.\n\nSo, it seems consistent regardless of the total number of houses assumed.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of total windows that belong to single-story houses is approximately 46.15%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{46.15\\%} \\]"
