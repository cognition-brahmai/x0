In astrology, Venus is associated with love, beauty, harmony, and relationships. People born under Venus are said to have a natural charm and attractiveness, and they often have a talent for art and creativity. They are also believed to be romantic and diplomatic, with a tendency to seek balance and harmony in their lives. However, it's important to note that astrology is not a science and should not be taken too seriously."
