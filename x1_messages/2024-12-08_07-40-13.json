        "content": "Sure! Kadane's algorithm is an efficient way to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. It operates in O(n) time complexity, making it much faster than the brute-force approach which runs in O(n^2).\n\nHere's how Kadane's algorithm works:\n\n1. Initialize two variables: one to keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far (maxSoFar) and another to keep track of the maximum sum ending at the current position (maxEndingHere).\n\n2. Iterate through the array from the beginning to the end.\n\n3. For each element, update maxEndingHere by adding the current element to it.\n\n4. If maxEndingHere becomes negative, reset it to zero because a negative sum will only decrease the sum of any subsequent subarrays.\n\n5. If maxEndingHere is greater than maxSoFar, update maxSoFar with the value of maxEndingHere.\n\n6. After completing the iteration, maxSoFar will hold the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.\n\nNow, let's implement this in JavaScript.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we'll use Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time. This algorithm is particularly useful for arrays containing both positive and negative integers.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize two variables:\n     - `maxSoFar` to keep track of the maximum sum found so far. It is set to the smallest possible integer to handle cases where all numbers are negative.\n     - `maxEndingHere` to keep track of the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current position.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - We iterate through the array, updating `maxEndingHere` by adding the current element.\n   - If `maxEndingHere` becomes less than the current element, we reset `maxEndingHere` to the current element. This step is crucial for handling negative sums.\n   - If `maxSoFar` is less than `maxEndingHere`, we update `maxSoFar` with the value of `maxEndingHere`.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - After completing the iteration, `maxSoFar` holds the largest sum of any contiguous subarray.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction maxSubarraySum(arr) {\n    if (arr.length === 0) {\n        return 0; // Return 0 for empty arrays\n    }\n\n    let maxSoFar = arr[0];\n    let maxEndingHere = arr[0];\n\n    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {\n        maxEndingHere = Math.max(arr[i], maxEndingHere + arr[i]);\n        maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);\n    }\n\n    return maxSoFar;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: We start by setting `maxSoFar` and `maxEndingHere` to the first element of the array.\n- **Iteration**: For each element in the array starting from the second element:\n  - We calculate the maximum of the current element and the sum of `maxEndingHere` and the current element.\n  - We update `maxSoFar` if `maxEndingHere` is greater than `maxSoFar`.\n- **Result**: The function returns `maxSoFar`, which is the largest sum of any contiguous subarray in the input array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum subarray sum in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array."
