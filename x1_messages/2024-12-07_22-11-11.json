Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price. It is one of the most important concepts in business. It can reveal whether a change in price will result in a change in the quantity demanded. What does a price elasticity of demand greater than 1 indicate?\nA. The good is a necessity\nB. The good is a luxury\nC. The quantity demanded is unresponsive to price changes\nD. The quantity demanded is highly responsive to price changes"

        "content": "A price elasticity of demand greater than 1 indicates that the quantity demanded is highly responsive to price changes. This means that a small change in price will lead to a proportionally larger change in the quantity demanded. Such goods are considered elastic in demand.\n\nTo elaborate, price elasticity of demand (PED) is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. When PED is greater than 1, it signifies that the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. This elasticity suggests that consumers are very sensitive to price changes for this good.\n\nGoods with a PED greater than 1 are often considered luxuries or non-essential items. For example, jewelry, designer clothing, and premium cars typically have elastic demand because consumers can choose to do without them or substitute cheaper alternatives when prices rise.\n\nOn the other hand, goods with a PED less than 1 are considered inelastic. These are usually necessities like food, utilities, and healthcare services, for which demand remains relatively stable even when prices change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The quantity demanded is highly responsive to price changes\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that option B, \"The good is a luxury,\" is also related but not as directly precise as option D. Luxuries often have elastic demand, but the direct interpretation of PED >1 is that the quantity demanded is highly responsive to price changes.\n\n**Additional Insight:**\n\nUnderstanding price elasticity is crucial for businesses to set optimal prices and predict how changes in price will affect their total revenue. For elastic goods (PED >1), a price increase will lead to a decrease in total revenue because the drop in quantity demanded outweighs the price increase. Conversely, a price decrease will lead to an increase in total revenue.\n\nFor inelastic goods (PED <1), a price increase will lead to an increase in total revenue because the quantity demanded does not decrease proportionally to the price increase. Similarly, a price decrease will lead to a decrease in total revenue.\n\nTherefore, businesses selling elastic goods might consider lowering prices to increase total revenue, while those selling inelastic goods might increase prices to boost revenue.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose a product has a PED of 2. This means that if the price increases by 1%, the quantity demanded decreases by 2%. If the original price is $100 and the quantity demanded is 1000 units, a 1% price increase to $101 would lead to a 2% decrease in quantity demanded to 980 units.\n\nOriginal total revenue: 100 * 1000 = $100,000\n\nNew total revenue: 101 * 980 = $98,980\n\nThus, the total revenue decreases by $1,020 despite the price increase, illustrating the principle for elastic goods.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPrice elasticity of demand is a fundamental concept in economics that helps businesses understand how demand for their products responds to price changes. A PED greater than 1 indicates that the quantity demanded is highly responsive to price changes, suggesting that the good is elastic and possibly a luxury item. This knowledge is crucial for pricing strategies and revenue management.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Perloff, J. M. (2017). *Microeconomics* (8th ed.). Pearson.\n\n- Salvatore, D.
