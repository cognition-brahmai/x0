        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two products: Product A and Product B. The factory has a choice each day: it can produce either 100 units of Product A or 200 units of Product B. It operates for 20 days in total and produces 3000 units altogether. We need to find out how many days were spent producing each product.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of days spent producing Product A.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of days spent producing Product B.\n\nNow, since the factory operates for 20 days in total, we can write the first equation as:\n\n\\[ x + y = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know that on days when Product A is produced, the factory makes 100 units per day, and on days when Product B is produced, it makes 200 units per day. The total production over 20 days is 3000 units. So, we can write the second equation as:\n\n\\[ 100x + 200y = 3000 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( 100x + 200y = 3000 \\)\n\nWe can simplify this system to make it easier to solve. Let's start by simplifying the second equation. We can divide every term in the second equation by 100:\n\n\\[ \\frac{100x}{100} + \\frac{200y}{100} = \\frac{3000}{100} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x + 2y = 30 \\]\n\nNow, our system of equations looks like this:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( x + 2y = 30 \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we can use the subtraction method. Let's subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n\\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 30 - 20 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x + 2y - x - y = 10 \\]\n\nWhich further simplifies to:\n\n\\[ y = 10 \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 10 \\). Now that we have \\( y \\), we can plug this value back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the factory spent 10 days producing Product A and 10 days producing Product B.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If the factory produces Product A for 10 days, at 100 units per day, that's:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 100 = 1000 \\text{ units of Product A} \\]\n\nAnd for Product B, 10 days at 200 units per day:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 200 = 2000 \\text{ units of Product B} \\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[ 1000 + 2000 = 3000 \\text{ units total} \\]\n\nAnd the total days are:\n\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nIt all checks out. So, the answer is 10 days each for Product A and Product B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ days for Product A and } 10 \\text{ days for Product B}} \\]"
