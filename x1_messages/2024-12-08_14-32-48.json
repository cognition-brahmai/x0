        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular room. The area is 200 square meters, and the length is 5 meters more than twice its width. I need to find the dimensions, which means both the length and the width. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area = length \u00d7 width. In this case, area is 200 square meters. So, length \u00d7 width = 200.\n\nNow, it's given that the length is 5 meters more than twice the width. That means length = 2 \u00d7 width + 5 meters. So, if I let the width be represented by a variable, say W, then the length would be 2W + 5.\n\nSo, substituting back into the area equation: (2W + 5) \u00d7 W = 200.\n\nLet me write that down: (2W + 5)W = 200.\n\nNow, I'll distribute W: 2W\u00b2 + 5W = 200.\n\nWait, that gives me a quadratic equation: 2W\u00b2 + 5W - 200 = 0.\n\nQuadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. I think I'll try to factor this one first.\n\nSo, 2W\u00b2 + 5W - 200 = 0.\n\nLet me see if I can factor this. I need two numbers that multiply to 2 \u00d7 (-200) = -400 and add up to 5.\n\nHmmm, what could they be? Let's see, 25 and -16: 25 \u00d7 (-16) = -400, and 25 + (-16) = 9. Not 5.\n\nHow about 20 and -20: 20 \u00d7 (-20) = -400, but 20 + (-20) = 0. Not helpful.\n\n10 and -40: 10 \u00d7 (-40) = -400, and 10 + (-40) = -30. No.\n\n25 and -16 didn't work, 20 and -20 didn't work, 10 and -40 didn't work. Maybe I should try another approach.\n\nPerhaps I can use the quadratic formula: W = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)] / (2A), where A = 2, B = 5, and C = -200.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: W = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(5\u00b2 - 4\u00d72\u00d7(-200))] / (2\u00d72).\n\nCalculate inside the square root: 25 + 1600 = 1625.\n\nSo, W = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(1625)] / 4.\n\nNow, sqrt(1625). Let's see, 1625 divided by 25 is 65, so sqrt(1625) = sqrt(25\u00d765) = 5\u221a65.\n\nSo, W = [-5 \u00b1 5\u221a65] / 4.\n\nNow, since width can't be negative, I'll take the positive solution: W = [-5 + 5\u221a65] / 4.\n\nLet me calculate the numerical value of that.\n\nFirst, calculate \u221a65. \u221a64 is 8, \u221a81 is 9, so \u221a65 is approximately 8.062.\n\nSo, 5\u221a65 \u2248 5 \u00d7 8.062 = 40.31.\n\nThen, W = (-5 + 40.31) / 4 = 35.31 / 4 \u2248 8.8275 meters.\n\nSo, width is approximately 8.83 meters.\n\nNow, length = 2W + 5 = 2\u00d78.8275 + 5 \u2248 17.655 + 5 \u2248 22.655 meters.\n\nSo, the dimensions are approximately 8.83 meters in width and 22.66 meters in length.\n\nBut, to be precise, let's check if these values give us the area of 200 square meters.\n\n8.8275 \u00d7 22.655 \u2248 200.00 (should be close enough).\n\nAlternatively, I could have solved the quadratic equation more accurately, but this approximation is sufficient for most practical purposes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find exact values without approximating the square root.\n\nLet me recall that W = [-5 + sqrt(1625)] / 4.\n\nAnd sqrt(1625) = sqrt(25\u00d765) = 5\u221a65.\n\nSo, W = [-5 + 5\u221a65] / 4 = [5(-1 + \u221a65)] / 4.\n\nThat's the exact value for width.\n\nThen, length = 2W + 5 = 2*[5(-1 + \u221a65)] / 4 + 5 = [10(-1 + \u221a65)] / 4 + 5 = [5(-1 + \u221a65)] / 2 + 5.\n\nTo combine the terms, let's get a common denominator:\n\n[5(-1 + \u221a65) + 10] / 2 = [5\u221a65 - 5 + 10] / 2 = [5\u221a65 + 5] / 2 = 5(\u221a65 + 1)/2.\n\nSo, length = 5(\u221a65 + 1)/2 meters.\n\nSo, the exact dimensions are:\n\nWidth: [5(-1 + \u221a65)] / 4 meters\n\nLength: 5(\u221a65 + 1)/2 meters.\n\nAlternatively, rationalizing or simplifying further, but this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.\n\nGiven: area = 200 = length \u00d7 width\n\nAnd length = 2 \u00d7 width + 5.\n\nSo, 200 = (2W + 5)W\n\nWhich leads to 2W\u00b2 + 5W - 200 = 0.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the method of completing the square.\n\nStarting with 2W\u00b2 + 5W - 200 = 0.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 2: W\u00b2 + (5/2)W - 100 = 0.\n\nThen, move the constant term: W\u00b2 + (5/2)W = 100.\n\nNow, to complete the square, add (5/4)^2 = 25/16 to both sides:\n\nW\u00b2 + (5/2)W + 25/16 = 100 + 25/16.\n\nThat's W\u00b2 + (5/2)W + 25/16 = 1600/16 + 25/16 = 1625/16.\n\nNow, (W + 5/4)^2 = 1625/16.\n\nTake square roots: W + 5/4 = \u00b1sqrt(1625)/4.\n\nSo, W = -5/4 \u00b1 sqrt(1625)/4.\n\nAgain, width can't be negative, so W = [-5 + sqrt(1625)] / 4, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to factor it differently or use another method, but this seems sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions are approximately 8.83 meters in width and 22.66 meters in length.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe exact dimensions are:\n\n- Width: \\(\\dfrac{5(\\sqrt{65} - 1)}{4}\\) meters\n\n- Length: \\(\\dfrac{5(\\sqrt{65} + 1)}{2}\\) meters\n\nAlternatively, approximately:\n\n- Width: 8.83 meters\n\n- Length: 22.66 meters"
