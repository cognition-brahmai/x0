        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a farmer who has three fields with different areas: 8 acres, 12 acres, and 15 acres. The question is asking for the percentage of the total area that each field represents. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total area of all three fields combined. To do that, I'll add up the areas of each field:\n\nTotal area = 8 acres + 12 acres + 15 acres\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n8 + 12 = 20\n\n20 + 15 = 35\n\nSo, the total area is 35 acres.\n\nNow, to find the percentage that each field represents of the total area, I need to divide the area of each field by the total area and then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nLet's start with the first field, which is 8 acres.\n\nPercentage for the first field = (8 / 35) * 100\n\nI can calculate this step by step. First, divide 8 by 35:\n\n8 \u00f7 35 = 0.228571428571...\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.228571428571... * 100 = 22.8571428571...\n\nSo, the first field represents approximately 22.86% of the total area.\n\nNext, the second field is 12 acres.\n\nPercentage for the second field = (12 / 35) * 100\n\nAgain, divide 12 by 35:\n\n12 \u00f7 35 = 0.342857142857...\n\nMultiply by 100:\n\n0.342857142857... * 100 = 34.2857142857...\n\nSo, the second field represents approximately 34.29% of the total area.\n\nFinally, the third field is 15 acres.\n\nPercentage for the third field = (15 / 35) * 100\n\nDivide 15 by 35:\n\n15 \u00f7 35 = 0.428571428571...\n\nMultiply by 100:\n\n0.428571428571... * 100 = 42.8571428571...\n\nSo, the third field represents approximately 42.86% of the total area.\n\nJust to double-check, let's add up these percentages to ensure they total 100%:\n\n22.86% + 34.29% + 42.86% = 100.01%\n\nHmm, there's a slight discrepancy due to rounding. Each percentage was rounded to two decimal places, which led to a total of 100.01%. In practice, this is acceptable, but if higher precision is needed, more decimal places could be considered.\n\nAlternatively, I could present the percentages with more decimal places to reduce rounding error.\n\nFor example:\n\nFirst field: 22.8571%\n\nSecond field: 34.2857%\n\nThird field: 42.8571%\n\nAdding these up: 22.8571 + 34.2857 + 42.8571 = 99.9999%, which is effectively 100%.\n\nBut for most practical purposes, rounding to two decimal places should be sufficient.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- First field: approximately 22.86%\n\n- Second field: approximately 34.29%\n\n- Third field: approximately 42.86%\n\nAnd these percentages add up to approximately 100%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{First field: approximately } 22.86\\%, \\text{ Second field: approximately } 34.29\\%, \\text{ Third field: approximately } 42.86\\%}"
