        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains leaving from different stations at the same time, going towards each other. One is going at 60 mph from Station A to Station B, and the other is going at 40 mph from Station B to Station A. The distance between the stations is 200 miles. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 100 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between the stations is 200 miles. If they're closing in at 100 mph, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their combined speed. So, time = distance / speed = 200 miles / 100 mph = 2 hours.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe I can think about it differently to confirm.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the trains over time. Let\u2019s denote the time in hours after they start as t. The first train is going from A to B at 60 mph, so its position from A after t hours is 60t miles. The second train is going from B to A at 40 mph, so its position from B after t hours is 40t miles.\n\nSince the total distance is 200 miles, when they meet, the sum of the distances they've traveled should equal 200 miles. So, 60t + 40t = 200.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 100t = 200. Solving for t, t = 200 / 100 = 2 hours. Okay, that matches my first answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how each train is moving towards the other. The relative speed is indeed the sum of their speeds because they're moving towards each other. So, again, 60 + 40 = 100 mph, and time = distance / relative speed = 200 / 100 = 2 hours.\n\nI think this is correct. But to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any chance that the trains are not moving at constant speeds, or that there are stops along the way? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I can assume constant speeds without stops.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider one train stationary. If I take the train from A as stationary, then the train from B is approaching it at a speed of 60 + 40 = 100 mph. So, the train from B has to cover 200 miles at 100 mph, which again gives t = 2 hours.\n\nI feel confident with this answer. The trains will meet after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
