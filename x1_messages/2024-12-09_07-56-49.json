        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 25 students with an average age of 15 years. That means the total age of all the students combined is 25 times 15, which is 375 years.\n\nNow, when the teacher's age is included, the average age increases by one year to 16 years. But now, the total number of people in the class is 26 (25 students plus 1 teacher).\n\nSo, the total age of all 26 people should be 26 times 16, which is 416 years.\n\nTo find the teacher's age, we can subtract the total age of the students from the total age of the class including the teacher.\n\nTeacher's age = Total age with teacher - Total age of students = 416 - 375 = 41 years.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check.\n\nWe know that the average age of the students is 15, so the sum of their ages is 25 * 15 = 375.\n\nWhen the teacher is included, the average age becomes 16 for 26 people, so the sum of their ages is 26 * 16 = 416.\n\nTherefore, the teacher's age is 416 - 375 = 41 years.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it in terms of the increase in average age.\n\nThe average age increases by 1 year when the teacher is included. The teacher's age is like adding an extra 1 year to each of the 25 students' ages, which would be an additional 25 years, plus the teacher's age beyond that.\n\nWait, that might be a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet T be the teacher's age.\n\nThe sum of the students' ages is 25 * 15 = 375.\n\nThe sum including the teacher is 375 + T.\n\nThe average age with the teacher is (375 + T)/26 = 16.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(375 + T)/26 = 16\n\nNow, solve for T:\n\n375 + T = 16 * 26\n\n375 + T = 416\n\nT = 416 - 375\n\nT = 41\n\nSo, the teacher is 41 years old.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nIf the average age increases by 1 when the teacher is included, that means the teacher's age is the old average plus the number of people, which is a common formula in such problems.\n\nBut in this case, it's better to stick with the straightforward method.\n\nYes, I think 41 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41} \\]"
