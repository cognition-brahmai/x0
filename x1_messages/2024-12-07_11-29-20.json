        "content": "So, there are 7 billion people in the world, and each person has an average of 2.4 children. I need to find out how many grandchildren the average person has. Hmm, let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The average number of children per person is 2.4. So, for each person, they have 2.4 kids on average. Now, grandchildren would be the children of these children. So, it's like going one generation further.\n\nI need to find out, for an average person, how many grandchildren they have. That would depend on their children having their own children, right? So, it's the next generation down.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's consider one generation at a time.\n\nGeneration 1: The parents. There are 7 billion people.\n\nEach person in generation 1 has, on average, 2.4 children.\n\nSo, the total number of children in generation 2 would be 7 billion times 2.4.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n7,000,000,000 * 2.4 = 16,800,000,000.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If each of the 7 billion people has 2.4 children, the total number of children would be 7 billion times 2.4, which is 16.8 billion. But that doesn't make sense because the world population is 7 billion, and if each person has 2.4 children, the population should be increasing, which it is, but let's keep going.\n\nNow, each of these children in generation 2 will also have, on average, 2.4 children themselves, right? So, the grandchildren of generation 1 are the children of generation 2.\n\nSo, the total number of grandchildren would be the total number of children in generation 2 times the average number of children per person, which is 2.4.\n\nSo, 16,800,000,000 * 2.4.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n16,800,000,000 * 2.4 = 40,320,000,000.\n\nSo, the total number of grandchildren for generation 1 is 40.32 billion.\n\nBut we need to find the average number of grandchildren per person in generation 1.\n\nSo, we take the total number of grandchildren and divide it by the number of people in generation 1.\n\nThat is, 40,320,000,000 / 7,000,000,000 = 5.76.\n\nSo, the average number of grandchildren per person is 5.76.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total children in generation 2: 7 billion * 2.4 = 16.8 billion.\n\nThen, total grandchildren: 16.8 billion * 2.4 = 40.32 billion.\n\nAverage grandchildren per person in generation 1: 40.32 billion / 7 billion = 5.76.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of multiplication factors.\n\nIf each person has 2.4 children, and each of those children has 2.4 children, then the average number of grandchildren per person is 2.4 * 2.4 = 5.76.\n\nWait, that's even simpler. So, average children is 2.4, average grandchildren is 2.4 squared, which is 5.76.\n\nIn general, the average number of nth-generation descendants would be 2.4 raised to the power of n.\n\nSo, for great-grandchildren, it would be 2.4 cubed, and so on.\n\nBut in this case, we're only looking for grandchildren, which is 2.4 squared.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any overlap or double-counting here.\n\nEach person in generation 1 has their own set of children in generation 2, and each of those children has their own set of children in generation 3, which are the grandchildren to generation 1.\n\nSince each person's children are distinct (assuming no intermarriage or anything like that), then the total number of grandchildren per person should indeed be the average number of children per person squared.\n\nSo, 2.4 squared is 5.76.\n\nTherefore, the average number of grandchildren per person is 5.76.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider a smaller example.\n\nSuppose there are 100 people, each with 2.4 children.\n\nSo, total children would be 100 * 2.4 = 240.\n\nThen, each of these 240 children has 2.4 children themselves, so total grandchildren are 240 * 2.4 = 576.\n\nThen, the average number of grandchildren per person in the original generation is 576 / 100 = 5.76.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, regardless of the total population, as long as the average number of children per person is 2.4, the average number of grandchildren per person is 2.4 squared, which is 5.76.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.76.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.76} \\]"
