        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box containing red and blue balls. The problem states that there are twice as many red balls as blue balls initially. Then, after removing 5 red balls and adding 3 blue balls, the ratio of red to blue balls becomes 3:2. We need to find out how many red balls were there at the beginning.\n\nFirst, let's assign variables to the number of balls. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of blue balls initially in the box.\n\n- Since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, the number of red balls initially is \\( 2b \\).\n\nNow, according to the problem, we remove 5 red balls and add 3 blue balls. So, after these changes:\n\n- The number of red balls becomes \\( 2b - 5 \\).\n\n- The number of blue balls becomes \\( b + 3 \\).\n\nThe new ratio of red to blue balls is 3:2. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2b - 5}{b + 3} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( b \\), the initial number of blue balls, and then find the initial number of red balls, which is \\( 2b \\).\n\nLet\u2019s solve this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n2(2b - 5) = 3(b + 3)\n\\]\n\nNow, distribute the constants:\n\n\\[\n4b - 10 = 3b + 9\n\\]\n\nNext, let's get all the \\( b \\) terms on one side and the constants on the other side. Subtract \\( 3b \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4b - 3b - 10 = 9\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nb - 10 = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, add 10 to both sides to solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = 19\n\\]\n\nSo, there were initially 19 blue balls in the box. Since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, the initial number of red balls is:\n\n\\[\n2b = 2 \\times 19 = 38\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there were initially 38 red balls in the box.\n\nWait a minute, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2b - 5}{b + 3} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n2(2b - 5) = 3(b + 3)\n\\]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\[\n4b - 10 = 3b + 9\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 3b \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nb - 10 = 9\n\\]\n\nAdding 10 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nb = 19\n\\]\n\nThen, initial red balls:\n\n\\[\n2b = 38\n\\]\n\nSeems correct. But let's verify if these numbers satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\nInitially:\n\n- Red balls: 38\n\n- Blue balls: 19\n\nAfter removing 5 red balls and adding 3 blue balls:\n\n- Red balls: 38 - 5 = 33\n\n- Blue balls: 19 + 3 = 22\n\nNow, the ratio of red to blue balls is 33:22, which simplifies to 3:2, as given in the problem.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The initial number of red balls was indeed 38.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{38} \\]"
