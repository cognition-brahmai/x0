Each stage should align with an evidence value, which is the output of one of the accessible functions given an input string that might be the user question, earlier evidence values, or a blend of both.\n\nAvailable tools are:\nNetSearch[input]: Enables the user to search for information using a generic internet search engine. It helps in locating a variety of sites that may hold the answer to the user's query.\nTextScrape[input]: Loads one or several websites from the input string holding newline separated links, where input comprises one or multiple links, and yields plain text including the content of the links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and delivers a plain text, newline separated response of URLs.\nQuerySolver[input]: A question-answering language model, handy for answering queries based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a text question referring to an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the population of Tokyo, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should adhere to this structure:\nPlan: [initial action to undertake based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to invoke with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action to undertake, hinged on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [following function to invoke and input parameter, which may allude to preceding evidence, e.g., \"Considering context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: carrying the ultimate answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are the causes and effects of climate change according to recent studies?"
