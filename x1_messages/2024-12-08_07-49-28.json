        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer has 120 meters of fencing material to enclose a rectangular field, and I need to figure out what dimensions will maximize the area of that field. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all four sides. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so the perimeter P is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. In formula terms, that's P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nNow, the farmer has 120 meters of fencing, which means the perimeter of the field is 120 meters. So, 2L + 2W = 120. I can simplify that by dividing both sides by 2, which gives me L + W = 60. That's helpful.\n\nNext, I need to maximize the area. The area A of a rectangle is length times width, so A = L * W.\n\nBut I have one equation from the perimeter: L + W = 60. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other using this equation. Let's solve for W in terms of L: W = 60 - L.\n\nNow, substitute that into the area formula: A = L * (60 - L) = 60L - L^2.\n\nSo, the area A is equal to 60L - L^2. That's a quadratic equation in terms of L, and it's in the form A = -L^2 + 60L.\n\nI recall that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of L^2 is negative, this parabola opens downwards, which means it has a maximum point. That maximum point will give me the maximum area.\n\nTo find the maximum, I can find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form for a parabola given by y = ax^2 + bx + c has its vertex at x = -b/(2a).\n\nIn my equation, A = -L^2 + 60L, so a = -1 and b = 60.\n\nPlugging into the vertex formula: L = -60/(2*(-1)) = -60/-2 = 30.\n\nSo, the length that maximizes the area is 30 meters.\n\nNow, using the perimeter equation, L + W = 60, so if L = 30, then W = 60 - 30 = 30 meters.\n\nWait a minute, so both length and width are 30 meters? That means the field would be a square.\n\nI thought rectangles can have different length and width, but in this case, it's turning out to be a square.\n\nIs that possible? Is a square considered a rectangle?\n\nWell, yes, a square is a special type of rectangle where all sides are equal. So, it still qualifies as a rectangle.\n\nBut, is this really the maximum area possible with 120 meters of fencing?\n\nLet me check with some other dimensions to be sure.\n\nSuppose I choose L = 40 meters, then W = 60 - 40 = 20 meters.\n\nThe area would be A = 40 * 20 = 800 square meters.\n\nIf L = 30 meters, W = 30 meters, A = 30 * 30 = 900 square meters.\n\nYes, that's larger than 800.\n\nWhat if L = 20 meters, then W = 40 meters, A = 20 * 40 = 800 square meters again.\n\nSeems like it's less than 900.\n\nLet me try L = 35 meters, W = 25 meters, A = 35 * 25 = 875 square meters, which is still less than 900.\n\nAnd if L = 25 meters, W = 35 meters, A = 25 * 35 = 875 again.\n\nSo, indeed, the maximum area is achieved when L = W = 30 meters.\n\nI think this makes sense because, for a given perimeter, a square encloses the maximum possible area.\n\nThis is a general property of rectangles: among all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the square has the largest area.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the farmer should make the field a square with sides of 30 meters each to maximize the area with 120 meters of fencing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ meters by } 30 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
