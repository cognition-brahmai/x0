        "content": "This is a classic problem known as the Monty Hall problem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nInitially, there are three doors: Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two are goats. You choose Door 1.\n\nThe host, who knows what's behind each door, opens Door 3 to reveal a goat. Now, you have the option to either stick with Door 1 or switch to Door 2.\n\nLet's analyze the probabilities in both scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1: Stick with Door 1**\n\nWhen you first chose Door 1, the probability that the car was behind it was 1/3. This doesn't change just because the host opened another door.\n\nSo, the probability of winning the car by sticking with Door 1 is 1/3.\n\n**Scenario 2: Switch to Door 2**\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if you switch to Door 2.\n\nInitially, the probability that the car is behind Door 2 is also 1/3. However, when the host opens Door 3 to reveal a goat, this action provides new information.\n\nSince the host always opens a door with a goat and he chose Door 3, this means that if the car was behind Door 2, he would have had to open Door 3. If the car was behind Door 1, he could have opened either Door 2 or Door 3, but in this case, he opened Door 3.\n\nTo find the probability that the car is behind Door 2 given that the host opened Door 3, we can use Bayes' theorem or consider it logically.\n\nLet's think logically:\n\n- There are two doors left: Door 1 and Door 2.\n\n- The host opened Door 3, which has a goat.\n\n- The car is either behind Door 1 or Door 2.\n\n- Initially, the probability that the car is behind Door 1 is 1/3, and behind Door 2 is 1/3.\n\n- However, the host's action affects these probabilities.\n\nWait a minute, actually, initially, the probability that the car is behind Door 1 is 1/3, and the combined probability for Doors 2 and 3 is 2/3.\n\nWhen the host opens Door 3 to reveal a goat, the entire 2/3 probability that the car is behind either Door 2 or Door 3 now shifts entirely to Door 2, because Door 3 is opened and has a goat.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the car is behind Door 2 is now 2/3.\n\nSo, if you switch to Door 2, your probability of winning the car is 2/3.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- Stick with Door 1: Probability = 1/3\n\n- Switch to Door 2: Probability = 2/3\n\nTherefore, you should switch to Door 2 to have a higher probability of winning the car.\n\n**General Rule:**\n\nIn the Monty Hall problem, switching doors after the host reveals a goat always increases your chances of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3.\n\n**Intuition:**\n\nThe key is that the host's action is not random. He always opens a door with a goat, which provides information about where the car might be. By switching, you're essentially choosing both Door 2 and Door 3 initially, and when one is eliminated, you get to pick the remaining door with the higher combined probability.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the probabilities involved in this intriguing problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{You should switch to Door 2. The probability of winning the car by switching is } \\frac{2}{3}, \\text{ while sticking with Door 1 gives a probability of } \\frac{1}{3}.} \\]"
