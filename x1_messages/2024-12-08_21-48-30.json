        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 4x - 7 = 21. Alright, let's see how to tackle this step by step. The goal here is to find out what x is, right? So, I need to isolate x on one side of the equation.\n\nFirst, I look at what's being done to x. It looks like x is being multiplied by 4 and then 7 is being subtracted. To isolate x, I need to undo these operations, but in the reverse order. So, I should start by dealing with the subtraction first.\n\nThat means I need to add 7 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -7 on the left. So, if I add 7 to both sides:\n\n4x - 7 + 7 = 21 + 7\n\nThe -7 and +7 on the left cancel out, leaving me with:\n\n4x = 28\n\nNow, I need to deal with the multiplication by 4. To isolate x, I should divide both sides by 4:\n\n4x / 4 = 28 / 4\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 7\n\nAlright, so x equals 7. But let me just double-check that this is correct by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 4x - 7 = 21\n\nPlug in x = 7: 4*(7) - 7 = 28 - 7 = 21\n\nYes, that matches the right side. So, x = 7 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
