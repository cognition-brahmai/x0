        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains moving towards each other. One leaves Town A at 9 am going towards Town B at 60 mph, and the other leaves Town B at the same time going towards Town A at 90 mph. The distance between the towns is 300 miles. I need to find out when they'll pass each other.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 150 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is 300 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 300 miles / 150 mph = 2 hours\n\nThat means they'll meet 2 hours after they both leave their respective towns.\n\nSince both trains left at 9 am, I just need to add 2 hours to that time.\n\n9 am + 2 hours = 11 am\n\nTherefore, the trains will pass each other at 11 am.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nLet's think about how far each train travels in that time.\n\nTrain from Town A: 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nTrain from Town B: 90 mph * 2 hours = 180 miles\n\nTotal distance covered: 120 + 180 = 300 miles, which matches the distance between the towns. So, yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to find the exact time.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after 9 am when they meet.\n\nThen, distance covered by Train A: 60t miles\n\nDistance covered by Train B: 90t miles\n\nTotal distance: 60t + 90t = 150t miles\n\nSet that equal to the initial distance: 150t = 300\n\nSolving for t: t = 300 / 150 = 2 hours\n\nAgain, they meet after 2 hours, so 11 am.\n\nI think that's solid. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed, like different speeds or something else, but in this problem, the speeds are constant, and there's no mention of any other variables.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the trains will pass each other at 11 am.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11 \\text{ am}} \\]"
