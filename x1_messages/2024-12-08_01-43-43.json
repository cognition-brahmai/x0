        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: If every person in a room shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, and there were a total of 66 handshakes, how many people are in the room?\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic problem in combinatorics. I think it has something to do with combinations, where we're choosing pairs of people to shake hands.\n\nSo, if there are n people in the room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once, then the total number of handshakes should be the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n, because a handshake involves two people.\n\nIn mathematical terms, that would be the combination formula: C(n, 2), which is equal to n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\nn(n-1)/2 = 66\n\nNow, I need to solve for n.\n\nFirst, I can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\nn(n-1) = 132\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation:\n\nn\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation for n.\n\nI can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula.\n\nLet's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1.\n\nLet's see, what are the factors of 132?\n\n1 and 132, 2 and 66, 3 and 44, 4 and 33, 6 and 22, 11 and 12.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -132 and add to -1.\n\nLooking at the positive factors, if I take -12 and 11:\n\n-12 * 11 = -132\n\n-12 + 11 = -1\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(n - 12)(n + 11) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives me:\n\nn - 12 = 0 \u21d2 n = 12\n\nn + 11 = 0 \u21d2 n = -11\n\nBut n represents the number of people, which can't be negative, so n = 12.\n\nWait, but I should check if this makes sense.\n\nIf there are 12 people, then the number of handshakes is C(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66, which matches the given number.\n\nSo, n = 12 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't want to factor, I could have used the quadratic formula:\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 528)] / 2\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a529] / 2\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 23] / 2\n\nn = (1 + 23)/2 = 24/2 = 12\n\nn = (1 - 23)/2 = -22/2 = -11\n\nAgain, n = 12 is the valid solution.\n\nSo, there are 12 people in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
