        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Creating a Java program that accepts user input for a string, reverses it, and prints the reversed string to the console is a straightforward task. We'll need to use some basic Java concepts such as reading input from the user and manipulating strings.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps we need to follow:\n\n1. **Read user input:** We need to accept a string from the user.\n2. **Reverse the string:** Once we have the string, we need to reverse it.\n3. **Print the reversed string:** Finally, we'll display the reversed string on the console.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll use the `Scanner` class for reading input and a simple loop or built-in methods to reverse the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class ReverseString {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the user\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter a string\n        System.out.println(\"Enter a string:\");\n        String input = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        // Reverse the string\n        String reversed = reverse(input);\n\n        // Print the reversed string\n        System.out.println(\"Reversed string: \" + reversed);\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n\n    // Method to reverse a string\n    public static String reverse(String s) {\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);\n        return sb.reverse().toString();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading User Input:**\n   - We import `java.util.Scanner` to handle input.\n   - Create a `Scanner` object linked to `System.in` to read from the console.\n   - Use `scanner.nextLine()` to read the entire line of input.\n\n2. **Reversing the String:**\n   - We define a method `reverse` that takes a string as input.\n   - Use `StringBuilder`, which has a `reverse` method, to reverse the string efficiently.\n\n3. **Printing the Reversed String:**\n   - Concatenate the reversed string with a message and print it using `System.out.println`.\n\n4. **Closing the Scanner:**\n   - It's important to close the `Scanner` object to free up resources.\n\nThis program is simple and effective for reversing strings in Java.
