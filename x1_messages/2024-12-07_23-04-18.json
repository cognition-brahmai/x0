        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There are 8 pairs of socks in a drawer, and each pair consists of one black sock and one white sock. If I pull out two socks at random, what's the chance they will be a matching pair? Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in the drawer. There are 8 pairs, so that means there are 16 socks in total, right? Because each pair has two socks.\n\nNow, each pair consists of one black and one white sock. So, for each pair, there's a black one and a white one. Does that mean that all the black socks are different from each other, and all the white socks are different from each other, but each pair has one black and one white?\n\nWait, actually, the problem says each pair consists of one black sock and one white sock. So, it's not that all black socks are identical or anything like that. Each pair has distinct socks, one black and one white.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can assume that all black socks are identical and all white socks are identical, since the colors are specified.\n\nWait, no, the problem is about matching pairs, so perhaps the socks are distinguishable based on their pairs.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nTotal socks: 16 (8 black and 8 white, assuming equal numbers).\n\nBut no, the problem says each pair has one black and one white sock. So, it's not that there are 8 black and 8 white socks, because each pair has one of each.\n\nWait, actually, yes, that's correct. Each pair has one black and one white, and there are 8 pairs, so 8 black and 8 white socks in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that if I pull out two socks at random, they will be a matching pair. A matching pair would mean two socks of the same color, right?\n\nWait, no. The problem specifies that each pair consists of one black and one white sock. So, a matching pair would mean one black and one white from the same pair, I think.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let's see.\n\nIf each pair has one black and one white sock, then a matching pair would be taking one black and one white from the same original pair.\n\nBut, in the drawer, all socks are mixed up. So, when I pull out two socks at random, I could get two blacks, two whites, or one black and one white.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the probability that they will be a matching pair. Given that each pair consists of one black and one white sock, a matching pair would be one black and one white from the same original pair.\n\nWait, but if I pull out two socks, they could be either both black, both white, or one black and one white.\n\nBut according to the problem, a matching pair would be one black and one white from the same original pair.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nPerhaps a matching pair means two socks that originally belonged together, meaning one black and one white from the same pair.\n\nSo, in that case, a matching pair is specifically one black and one white from the same original pair.\n\nOkay, so to find the probability of pulling out a matching pair, meaning one black and one white from the same original pair.\n\nAlright, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to pull out two socks from 16 socks. That would be the combination of 16 socks taken 2 at a time, which is denoted as C(16,2).\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(16,2) = 16! / (2!(16-2)!) = (16\u00d715)/ (2\u00d71) = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to choose two socks from 16.\n\nNow, how many of these ways are matching pairs?\n\nA matching pair is one black and one white from the same original pair.\n\nSince there are 8 original pairs, there are 8 such matching pairs.\n\nWait, but in the drawer, all socks are mixed up, so when I pull out two socks, how do I ensure they are from the same original pair?\n\nActually, the problem is a bit tricky because it's not just about color; it's about whether the two socks were originally a pair.\n\nSo, in the drawer, there are 16 socks: 8 black and 8 white, with each black sock having its white counterpart from the same pair.\n\nNow, when I pull out two socks, the number of ways to get a matching pair is equal to the number of original pairs, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = number of matching pairs / total number of ways to choose two socks = 8 / 120 = 1/15.\n\nWait, but is this correct?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: First, I pick one sock. Then, I pick the second sock.\n\nThe first sock can be any sock, so there are 16 choices.\n\nThen, for the second sock, to make it a matching pair, it has to be the specific sock that matches the first one.\n\nEach sock has only one matching sock, because each pair consists of one black and one white sock.\n\nSo, for example, if I pick a black sock first, there are 8 white socks, but only one of them matches the black sock I picked.\n\nSimilarly, if I pick a white sock first, there are 8 black socks, but only one of them matches the white sock I picked.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a matching pair is 1/15.\n\nWait, why 1/15?\n\nBecause after picking the first sock, there are 15 socks left, and only one of them is the matching sock.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/15.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated it as 8/120, which is also 1/15.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/15.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of ways to pick one black and one white sock that are from the same pair.\n\nThere are 8 pairs, so there are 8 such pairs.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any two socks is C(16,2) = 120.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 8/120 = 1/15.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the sequence: first pick one sock, then pick another.\n\nThe probability that the second sock is the matching one is 1/15, as there is only one matching sock out of the remaining 15.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the probability remains 1/15.\n\nTherefore, the chance of pulling out a matching pair is 1/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}} \\]"
