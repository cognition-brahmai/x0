        "content": "So there's this problem here: In a group of 30 people, 12 prefer tea, and the rest prefer coffee. I need to find the ratio of tea drinkers to coffee drinkers.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many people prefer coffee. Since there are 30 people in total and 12 prefer tea, I can subtract the tea drinkers from the total to get the number of coffee drinkers.\n\nSo, coffee drinkers = total people - tea drinkers = 30 - 12 = 18.\n\nAlright, so there are 18 people who prefer coffee.\n\nNow, the ratio of tea drinkers to coffee drinkers is tea drinkers : coffee drinkers, which is 12 : 18.\n\nI think I can simplify this ratio. To simplify, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 18 and divide both numbers by it.\n\nThe GCD of 12 and 18 is 6.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 6:\n\n12 \u00f7 6 = 2\n\n18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio is 2 : 3.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using fractions or something.\n\nWell, the ratio 12:18 is the same as the fraction 12/18.\n\nSimplifying 12/18 by dividing numerator and denominator by 6 gives 2/3, which matches the ratio 2:3.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the ratio in decimal form, but I don't think that's necessary here since ratios are usually expressed in whole numbers.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nTotal people: 30\n\nTea drinkers: 12\n\nCoffee drinkers: 30 - 12 = 18\n\nRatio: 12:18\n\nSimplify by dividing by 6: 2:3\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer: the ratio of tea drinkers to coffee drinkers is 2:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2:3} \\]"
