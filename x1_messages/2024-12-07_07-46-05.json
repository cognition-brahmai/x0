        "content": "So the restaurant serves 100 meals every day, and each meal creates about 0.5 kilograms of food waste. I need to find out how much food waste the restaurant makes in a whole week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the daily food waste. Since each meal generates 0.5 kg of waste, and they serve 100 meals a day, I can multiply these two numbers to get the daily waste.\n\nSo, daily food waste = number of meals per day \u00d7 waste per meal\nThat is, 100 meals/day \u00d7 0.5 kg/meal\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 100 \u00d7 0.5 = 50 kg/day\n\nOkay, so the restaurant produces 50 kilograms of food waste each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly waste, I need to multiply the daily waste by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:\n\nWeekly food waste = daily food waste \u00d7 number of days in a week\nThat is, 50 kg/day \u00d7 7 days/week\n\nMultiplying that gives: 50 \u00d7 7 = 350 kg/week\n\nSo, the restaurant generates 350 kilograms of food waste in a week.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total number of meals in a week first, and then multiply by the waste per meal.\n\nTotal meals per week = meals per day \u00d7 days per week\nThat is, 100 meals/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 700 meals/week\n\nThen, total food waste = total meals per week \u00d7 waste per meal\nThat is, 700 meals/week \u00d7 0.5 kg/meal\n\nMultiplying that: 700 \u00d7 0.5 = 350 kg/week\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, 350 kilograms per week seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of units to make sure everything makes sense.\n\nStarting with meals per day (100 meals/day) and waste per meal (0.5 kg/meal), when I multiply them, the 'meals' unit cancels out, leaving kilograms per day:\n\n(100 meals/day) \u00d7 (0.5 kg/meal) = 50 kg/day\n\nThen, multiplying by days per week (7 days/week):\n\n(50 kg/day) \u00d7 (7 days/week) = 350 kg/week\n\nYes, the units confirm that the result is in kilograms per week.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 0.5 kilograms is half a kilogram. So, per meal, it's half a kilo of waste. For 100 meals, that's 50 kilograms a day. Over seven days, that's 350 kilograms.\n\nI can also consider smaller numbers to make sure. For example, if there was only one meal per day generating 0.5 kg of waste, in a week that would be 0.5 kg/day \u00d7 7 days = 3.5 kg/week. So, for 100 meals, it should be 100 times that, which is 350 kg/week. That makes sense.\n\nMoreover, considering real-world contexts, 350 kilograms of food waste per week seems like a plausible amount for a restaurant that serves 100 meals a day. It's a significant amount, which might encourage the restaurant to look into waste management strategies or composting to handle the waste more sustainably.\n\nAlternatively, if the restaurant were to reduce its waste per meal, say to 0.4 kg, then the weekly waste would be 100 meals/day \u00d7 0.4 kg/meal \u00d7 7 days/week = 280 kg/week. So, small reductions in per-meal waste can lead to significant decreases in total waste over time.\n\nThis calculation could also be extended to monthly or annual waste amounts. For instance, if there are roughly 4 weeks in a month, then monthly waste would be 350 kg/week \u00d7 4 weeks/month = 1400 kg/month. Over a year, with approximately 52 weeks, the annual waste would be 350 kg/week \u00d7 52 weeks/year = 18,200 kg/year. That's 18.2 metric tons of waste per year, which is substantial and highlights the importance of efficient waste management practices.\n\nIn conclusion, the restaurant generates 350 kilograms of food waste per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{350 \\text{ kg/week}} \\]\n"
