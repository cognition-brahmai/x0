        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 6 green balls. So, total number of balls is 5 + 4 + 6, which is 15 balls. The problem is asking for the probability that if I pick 3 balls at random without replacement, all three will be different colors. That means one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nOkay, first thing I need to remember is that since it's without replacement, the probability changes with each pick. But I think a better way to approach this is to think about combinations, because the order doesn't matter here. It's just about the selection of balls, not the order in which they're picked.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 3 balls out of 15 is C(15,3), where C stands for combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(15,3) = 15! / (3! * (15-3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nThat's the total number of possible ways to pick 3 balls from 15.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, which are the selections where all three balls are different colors: one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nSo, the number of ways to pick one red ball from 5 is C(5,1) = 5.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick one blue ball from 4 is C(4,1) = 4.\n\nAnd the number of ways to pick one green ball from 6 is C(6,1) = 6.\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these: 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 120 / 455.\n\nNow, I can simplify that fraction. Both 120 and 455 are divisible by 5.\n\n120 \u00f7 5 = 24\n\n455 \u00f7 5 = 91\n\nSo, it becomes 24/91.\n\nWait, is that the simplest form? Let's check if 24 and 91 have any common factors. 24 is 8 \u00d7 3, and 91 is 7 \u00d7 13. No common factors there, so 24/91 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about this problem step by step, considering the probability at each draw.\n\nFirst pick: The probability of picking any color is 1, since there's no restriction on the first pick.\n\nSecond pick: The probability that the second ball is a different color from the first one.\n\nThird pick: The probability that the third ball is different from both of the first two.\n\nBut I think the combinations approach is simpler and less error-prone for this problem.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check with the step-by-step approach to verify my answer.\n\nFirst pick: Probability of picking any ball is 1.\n\nSecond pick: Probability that it's a different color from the first. Let's say the first ball was red (probability 5/15), then the second ball needs to be either blue or green, which are 4 + 6 = 10 balls left out of the remaining 14 balls. So, 10/14.\n\nBut since the first ball could have been any color, I need to consider all possibilities.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should stick with the combinations approach.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to calculate the probability that all three balls are the same color, or that two are the same and one is different, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that all three are different.\n\nBut I think that might be more complicated.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nTotal probability = probability all same color + probability exactly two same color + probability all different colors.\n\nBut we only want the probability that all are different colors.\n\nAlternatively, probability all different colors = 1 - (probability all same color + probability exactly two same color).\n\nBut calculating probability all same color and probability exactly two same color might be more work than just calculating the direct probability.\n\nLet's see:\n\nProbability all same color:\n\nCould be all red, all blue, or all green.\n\nProbability all red: C(5,3)/C(15,3) = 10/455\n\nProbability all blue: C(4,3)/C(15,3) = 4/455\n\nProbability all green: C(6,3)/C(15,3) = 20/455\n\nSo, total probability all same color = (10 + 4 + 20)/455 = 34/455\n\nProbability exactly two same color:\n\nCould be two red and one other, two blue and one other, or two green and one other.\n\nProbability two red and one blue: [C(5,2) * C(4,1)] / C(15,3) = (10 * 4)/455 = 40/455\n\nProbability two red and one green: (10 * 6)/455 = 60/455\n\nProbability two blue and one red: (6 * 5)/455 = 30/455\n\nProbability two blue and one green: (6 * 6)/455 = 36/455\n\nProbability two green and one red: (15 * 5)/455 = 75/455\n\nProbability two green and one blue: (15 * 4)/455 = 60/455\n\nWait, hold on. C(6,2) is 15, not 6. I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. C(4,2) for blue is 6, and C(6,2) for green is 15.\n\nBut in the \"two red and one blue\" scenario, it's C(5,2)*C(4,1) = 10*4 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, two red and one green: 10*6=60.\n\nTwo blue and one red: C(4,2)*C(5,1) = 6*5=30.\n\nTwo blue and one green: 6*6=36.\n\nTwo green and one red: C(6,2)*C(5,1)=15*5=75.\n\nTwo green and one blue: 15*4=60.\n\nSo, total probability for exactly two same color is (40 + 60 + 30 + 36 + 75 + 60)/455 = 301/455.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let's add up all these probabilities.\n\nProbability all same color: 34/455\n\nProbability exactly two same color: 301/455\n\nThen probability all different colors would be 1 - (34 + 301)/455 = 1 - 335/455 = 120/455, which simplifies to 24/91.\n\nOkay, so this matches my earlier calculation using combinations.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/91.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{91}} \\]"
