        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a company with 200 employees\u2014120 males and 80 females. It says that 40% of the males and 30% of the females have a college degree. I need to find out how many employees in total have a college degree.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many males have a college degree. There are 120 males, and 40% of them have a college degree. So, I can calculate that by multiplying 120 by 40%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky sometimes. I remember that 40% is the same as 40 per 100, or 0.4 in decimal form. So, to find 40% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.4.\n\nLet me do that: 120 times 0.4. That's 48. So, 48 males have a college degree.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many females have a college degree. There are 80 females, and 30% of them have a college degree. Again, 30% is the same as 0.3 in decimal form. So, I'll multiply 80 by 0.3.\n\n80 times 0.3 is 24. So, 24 females have a college degree.\n\nNow, to find the total number of employees with a college degree, I just need to add the number of males with degrees and the number of females with degrees together.\n\nThat's 48 plus 24, which equals 72.\n\nSo, 72 employees in total have a college degree.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of employees is 200, with 120 males and 80 females. I calculated 40% of 120 males, which is 48, and 30% of 80 females, which is 24. Adding those together gives 72.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of totals. Overall, the percentage of employees with college degrees would be the total number with degrees divided by the total number of employees, multiplied by 100. But I don't need that here; the question just asks for the total number with degrees, which I've calculated as 72.\n\nI think that makes sense. Unless there's some other factor I'm missing, like maybe some employees don't specify their gender or something, but the problem says there are 120 males and 80 females, which adds up to 200, so that seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe finding the overall percentage of employees with degrees.\n\nFirst, find the total number of males with degrees, which is 48, and females with degrees, which is 24, adding up to 72, as I already have.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the overall percentage by adding the percentages of males and females, but that wouldn't be accurate because it's not a weighted average. The male group is larger than the female group, so their percentage has more weight in the total.\n\nWait, no, actually, to find the overall percentage, I would need to find the total number with degrees and divide by the total number of employees, but since the question only asks for the total number, I don't need to calculate the overall percentage.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating things. The straightforward approach is best: calculate the number of males with degrees, calculate the number of females with degrees, add them together to get the total.\n\nSo, final answer: 72 employees have a college degree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
