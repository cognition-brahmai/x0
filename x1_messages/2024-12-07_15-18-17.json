        "content": "Let's see. So, the factory produces widgets in batches, and the first batch has 100 widgets. Each next batch has 10 more widgets than the one before it. I need to find out how many widgets are produced after the 10th batch.\n\nFirst, I should understand the pattern here. The first batch has 100 widgets, the second has 110, the third has 120, and so on, increasing by 10 each time.\n\nSo, it's an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 is 100, and the common difference d is 10.\n\nTo find the total number of widgets after the 10th batch, I need to find the sum of the first 10 terms of this sequence.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a1 + a_n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\n- a1 is the first term\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\nFirst, I need to find the 10th term (a_10).\n\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\na_n = a1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na_10 = 100 + (10 - 1) * 10\n\na_10 = 100 + 9 * 10\n\na_10 = 100 + 90\n\na_10 = 190\n\nSo, the 10th batch has 190 widgets.\n\nNow, back to the sum formula:\n\nS_10 = 10/2 * (100 + 190)\n\nS_10 = 5 * (290)\n\nS_10 = 1450\n\nTherefore, after completing the 10th batch, the factory will have produced a total of 1450 widgets.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I'm understanding the problem correctly. The question says \"after completing the 10th batch,\" which I interpret as the total up to and including the 10th batch. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (2a1 + (n - 1)d)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS_10 = 10/2 * (2*100 + (10 - 1)*10)\n\nS_10 = 5 * (200 + 90)\n\nS_10 = 5 * 290\n\nS_10 = 1450\n\nSame answer. So, I'm confident that 1450 is the correct total number of widgets after the 10th batch.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1450} \\]"
