        "content": "Let's see. There are 7 people in the family, and each has a different number of books. The youngest has 1 book, and each person has 3 more books than the person younger than them. So, I need to find out how many books the oldest one has.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out the number of books each person has, starting from the youngest.\n\nThe youngest has 1 book.\n\nThe next person has 1 + 3 = 4 books.\n\nThe third person has 4 + 3 = 7 books.\n\nThe fourth person has 7 + 3 = 10 books.\n\nThe fifth person has 10 + 3 = 13 books.\n\nThe sixth person has 13 + 3 = 16 books.\n\nAnd the oldest, who is the seventh person, would have 16 + 3 = 19 books.\n\nSo, the oldest family member has 19 books.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a formula I can use to calculate this more efficiently, especially if there are more people.\n\nI recall that this is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. In this case, the common difference is 3.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nwhere:\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- n is the term number\n\n- d is the common difference\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- a_1 = 1 (the youngest has 1 book)\n\n- d = 3 (each person has 3 more books than the previous one)\n\n- n = 7 (since there are 7 family members)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\na_7 = 1 + (7 - 1) * 3\n\na_7 = 1 + 6 * 3\n\na_7 = 1 + 18\n\na_7 = 19\n\nSo, again, the oldest family member has 19 books.\n\nThis matches what I got from listing them out, which is a good sign.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
