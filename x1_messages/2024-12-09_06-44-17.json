        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. The person drinks 8 glasses of water every day, and each glass contains 250 milliliters. We need to find out how many liters of water they consume in a month, assuming there are 30 days in that month.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how much water the person drinks in one day. Since they have 8 glasses each containing 250 milliliters, I can multiply the number of glasses by the volume per glass to get the total daily consumption.\n\nSo, 8 glasses/day \u00d7 250 mL/glass = 2000 mL/day.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much they drink in 30 days. So, I'll multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in the month.\n\n2000 mL/day \u00d7 30 days = 60,000 mL.\n\nBut the question asks for the amount in liters, not milliliters. I know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. So, to convert milliliters to liters, I need to divide the total milliliters by 1000.\n\n60,000 mL \u00f7 1000 = 60 liters.\n\nTherefore, the person consumes 60 liters of water in a month.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 8 glasses/day \u00d7 250 mL/glass = 2000 mL/day. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 2000 mL/day \u00d7 30 days = 60,000 mL. That also seems right.\n\nNow, converting 60,000 mL to liters: 60,000 \u00f7 1000 = 60 liters. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 60 liters per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
