Below is a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci series up to the n-th term, where n is provided by the user.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n    elif n == 1:\n        print(\"Fibonacci sequence up to\", n, \"term:\")\n        print(0)\n    elif n == 2:\n        print(\"Fibonacci sequence up to\", n, \"terms:\")\n        print(0, 1)\n    else:\n        print(\"Fibonacci sequence up to\", n, \"terms:\")\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        print(a, end=' ')\n        print(b, end=' ')\n        for _ in range(2, n):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n            print(b, end=' ')\n        print()  # for newline\n\n# Get user input\nn = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\nfibonacci(n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `fibonacci(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th term.\n2. **Input Validation**:\n   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it prompts the user to enter a positive integer.\n   - If `n` is 1, it prints only the first term, which is 0.\n   - If `n` is 2, it prints the first two terms: 0 and 1.\n3. **Sequence Generation**:\n   - For `n` greater than 2, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1 respectively.\n   - It prints the first two terms and then uses a loop to calculate and print the subsequent terms up to the n-th term.\n4. **User Input**:\n   - The user is prompted to enter the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci sequence.\n   - The function is called with this input.\n\nThis function efficiently handles the generation of the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified term and provides clear output to the user."
