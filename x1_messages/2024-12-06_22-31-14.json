        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $1.50 per pound and oranges for $2.00 per pound. I need to find out how much it would cost to buy 6 pounds of apples and 8 pounds of oranges.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the apples. Apples are $1.50 per pound, and I'm buying 6 pounds. So, I multiply 1.50 by 6.\n\n1.50 \u00d7 6 = 9.00\n\nSo, the apples will cost $9.00.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $2.00 per pound, and I'm buying 8 pounds. So, I multiply 2.00 by 8.\n\n2.00 \u00d7 8 = 16.00\n\nSo, the oranges will cost $16.00.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together.\n\n9.00 + 16.00 = 25.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy 6 pounds of apples and 8 pounds of oranges is $25.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25.00} \\]"
