The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 52 and k = 5.\n\nSo, C(52, 5) = 52! / (5!(52 - 5)!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 2,598,960.\n\nTherefore, there are 2,598,960 possible unique 5-card hands that can be dealt from a standard 52-card deck."
