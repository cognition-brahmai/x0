        "content": "Implementing a Golang program to read a CSV file containing names and ages, and then calculate and output the average age involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide along with a sample code to achieve this.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Read the CSV File:** Use Go's `encoding/csv` package to read the CSV file.\n2. **Parse the Data:** Extract the ages from the CSV records.\n3. **Calculate the Average Age:** Sum up all the ages and divide by the number of records to get the average.\n4. **Output the Result:** Print the average age to the console.\n\n### Sample Code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/csv\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfile, err := os.Open(\"people.csv\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\treader := csv.NewReader(file)\n\tvar ages []float64\n\n\tfor {\n\t\trecord, err := reader.Read()\n\t\tif err == io.EOF {\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Assuming the age is in the second column\n\t\tageStr := record[1]\n\t\tage, err := strconv.ParseFloat(ageStr, 64)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Invalid age value: %s\", ageStr)\n\t\t}\n\t\tages = append(ages, age)\n\t}\n\n\tif len(ages) == 0 {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"No ages found in the CSV file.\")\n\t}\n\n\tvar sum float64\n\tfor _, age := range ages {\n\t\tsum += age\n\t}\n\taverage := sum / float64(len(ages))\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Average age: %.2f\\n\", average)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Opening the CSV File:** The `os.Open` function is used to open the CSV file named \"people.csv\". Make sure this file exists in the same directory as your Go program or provide the full path.\n2. **Reading the CSV File:** A `csv.NewReader` is created from the file, and records are read one by one using a loop.\n3. **Parsing Ages:** Assuming ages are in the second column (index 1), they are parsed from strings to float64. Error handling is included to manage invalid age values.\n4. **Calculating the Average:** The ages are summed up, and the average is calculated by dividing the sum by the number of records.\n5. **Outputting the Result:** The average age is printed with two decimal places.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Ensure that the CSV file is correctly formatted and that the ages are numeric values.\n- Adjust the column index if the age is located in a different column.\n- This program does not handle headers; assumes the first row contains data. If there is a header, you might need to skip the first row.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for reading a CSV file and calculating the average age in Go."
