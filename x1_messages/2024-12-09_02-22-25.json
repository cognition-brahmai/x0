        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular garden that measures 25 feet by 15 feet, and I need to find out what the area is in square yards. Okay, first things first, I know that area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, in this case, it would be 25 feet times 15 feet. That should give me the area in square feet. But the question asks for the area in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet into square yards.\n\nAlright, let's start by calculating the area in square feet. 25 feet multiplied by 15 feet is... let's see, 25 times 15. I can calculate that as 25 times 10 is 250, plus 25 times 5, which is 125, so total 250 plus 125 equals 375 square feet. So, the area is 375 square feet.\n\nNow, I need to convert that to square yards. I know that 1 yard equals 3 feet, but since we're dealing with area, I need to think about square yards and square feet. So, 1 square yard would be equal to 3 feet by 3 feet, which is 9 square feet. Therefore, to convert square feet to square yards, I should divide the number of square feet by 9, because there are 9 square feet in one square yard.\n\nSo, taking the area in square feet, which is 375, and dividing it by 9 should give me the area in square yards. Let's do that division: 375 divided by 9. Well, 9 times 41 is 369, which is less than 375. 9 times 41 is 369, and 375 minus 369 is 6, so there's a remainder of 6. So, 375 divided by 9 is 41 with a remainder of 6, which is the same as 41 and 6/9, which simplifies to 41 and 2/3, since 6 divided by 9 is 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the area of the garden is 41 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Instead of calculating the area in square feet first and then converting to square yards, perhaps I can convert the measurements to yards before calculating the area.\n\nSo, the garden is 25 feet by 15 feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, I can convert each dimension to yards. 25 feet divided by 3 equals... 8 yards with a remainder of 1 foot, so 8 and 1/3 yards. Similarly, 15 feet divided by 3 equals 5 yards exactly.\n\nSo, the garden is 8 and 1/3 yards by 5 yards. Now, to find the area in square yards, I multiply these two measurements together: 8 and 1/3 yards times 5 yards.\n\nFirst, it's easier to work with improper fractions. 8 and 1/3 yards is the same as 25/3 yards (since 8 times 3 is 24, plus 1 is 25, over 3). So, 25/3 yards times 5 yards is (25/3) times 5, which is (25 times 5) divided by 3, which is 125/3 square yards.\n\nNow, 125 divided by 3 is... 3 times 41 is 123, with a remainder of 2, so it's 41 and 2/3 square yards, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 41 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use another approach. I know that in some cases, unit conversions can be tricky, so perhaps there's a formula or a different way to look at this.\n\nLet's consider the conversion factor directly. Since 1 square yard equals 9 square feet, then the area in square yards is equal to the area in square feet divided by 9. I already calculated the area in square feet as 375, so 375 divided by 9 is indeed 41 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to avoid fractions, I could express 41 and 2/3 as a decimal. 2/3 is approximately 0.6667, so 41 and 2/3 is about 41.6667 square yards. But since the problem doesn't specify the format, I can leave it as a fraction.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for every 9 square feet, there is 1 square yard. So, with 375 square feet, how many sets of 9 square feet are there? That would be 375 divided by 9, which again is 41 with a remainder of 6, or 41 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The area of the garden is 41 and 2/3 square yards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41 \\frac{2}{3}} \\]"
