        "content": "So I've got this problem here about candies in a bag. There are 7 chocolates, 13 gummies, and 5 hard candies. I need to find out the chance of picking either a chocolate or a hard candy without looking. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about probability, right? The probability of picking a chocolate or a hard candy. I remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the favorable outcomes here are picking either a chocolate or a hard candy. The total outcomes are all the candies in the bag.\n\nLet me find the total number of candies first. There are 7 chocolates, 13 gummies, and 5 hard candies. So, total candies = 7 + 13 + 5. That makes 25 candies in total.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are chocolates and hard candies. There are 7 chocolates and 5 hard candies, so favorable outcomes = 7 + 5 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 12/25.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that chocolates and hard candies are the only favorable outcomes, and that there's no overlap between them. In this case, chocolates and hard candies are distinct types, so no overlap.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether the problem is asking for the probability of picking a chocolate or a hard candy, which is what it seems, or maybe something else. But yes, that's what it is.\n\nSo, probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 12/25.\n\nI can leave it as a fraction, or I can convert it to a decimal or percentage if needed. 12/25 is 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nSo, there's a 48% chance of picking a chocolate or a hard candy.\n\nLet me just double-check. Total candies: 7 + 13 + 5 = 25. Favorable: 7 + 5 = 12. Probability: 12/25 = 0.48 = 48%. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.48} \\]"
