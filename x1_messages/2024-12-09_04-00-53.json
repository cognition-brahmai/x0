        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a room with 7 cats, and each of these cats has 6 legs instead of the usual 4. We need to figure out how many regular four-legged cats we should add to the room to make the average number of legs per cat equal to 5.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we have:\n\n- Number of cats with 6 legs: 7\n\n- Legs per unusual cat: 6\n\n- Legs per regular cat: 4\n\n- Desired average legs per cat: 5\n\nOur goal is to find out how many regular cats (with 4 legs) to add to the room to achieve this average.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of regular cats we need to add as \\( x \\).\n\nNow, let's think about the total number of cats after adding \\( x \\) regular cats:\n\nTotal cats = 7 (unusual) + \\( x \\) (regular)\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of legs in the room after adding the regular cats.\n\nTotal legs from unusual cats = 7 cats * 6 legs/cat = 42 legs\n\nTotal legs from regular cats = \\( x \\) cats * 4 legs/cat = 4x legs\n\nTherefore, the total legs in the room = 42 + 4x\n\nNow, the average number of legs per cat is defined as the total legs divided by the total number of cats. We want this average to be 5 legs per cat.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{42 + 4x}{7 + x} = 5\n\\]\n\nOur task is to solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by \\( 7 + x \\) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n\\[\n42 + 4x = 5(7 + x)\n\\]\n\nNow, distribute the 5 on the right side:\n\n\\[\n42 + 4x = 35 + 5x\n\\]\n\nNext, let's get all the \\( x \\)-terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Subtract \\( 4x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n42 = 35 + x\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract 35 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n7 = x\n\\]\n\nSo, we need to add 7 regular four-legged cats to the room to make the average number of legs per cat equal to 5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nWe have 7 cats with 6 legs each, so total legs from unusual cats: 7 * 6 = 42 legs.\n\nWe add \\( x \\) cats with 4 legs each, so total legs from regular cats: 4x legs.\n\nTotal legs in the room: 42 + 4x\n\nTotal number of cats: 7 + x\n\nWe want the average legs per cat to be 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{42 + 4x}{7 + x} = 5\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( 7 + x \\):\n\n\\[\n42 + 4x = 5(7 + x)\n\\]\n\nDistribute the 5:\n\n\\[\n42 + 4x = 35 + 5x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 4x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n42 = 35 + x\n\\]\n\nSubtract 35 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n7 = x\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. Adding 7 regular cats should do the trick.\n\nBut let's verify this by plugging the value back into the original equation to ensure it holds true.\n\nTotal cats after adding 7 regular cats: 7 (unusual) + 7 (regular) = 14 cats\n\nTotal legs: 42 (from unusual cats) + 4*7 = 42 + 28 = 70 legs\n\nAverage legs per cat: 70 legs / 14 cats = 5 legs/cat\n\nPerfect, it checks out.\n\nSo, the answer is that we need to add 7 regular four-legged cats to the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]\n"
