        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. It says the tank has a diameter of 4 meters and a height of 6 meters, and I need to find out how many liters of water it can hold when it's completely full. Also, there's a note that says 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the volume of the cylinder because that will tell me how much space is inside the tank, which corresponds to the amount of water it can hold. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nOkay, so the diameter is 4 meters. Remember that the radius is half of the diameter, so:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{4 \\, \\text{m}}{2} = 2 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThe height \\( h \\) is given as 6 meters.\n\nNow, plugging these values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (2 \\, \\text{m})^2 (6 \\, \\text{m}) \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (4 \\, \\text{m}^2) (6 \\, \\text{m}) \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (24 \\, \\text{m}^3) \\]\n\n\\[ V = 24\\pi \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nI can approximate \\( \\pi \\) as 3.1416 for more precision:\n\n\\[ V \\approx 24 \\times 3.1416 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 75.3984 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nBut wait, the problem also gives a note that 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters. So, to find out how many liters the tank can hold, I need to convert the volume from cubic meters to liters.\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in liters} = V \\times 1000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in liters} \\approx 75.3984 \\times 1000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in liters} \\approx 75,398.4 \\]\n\nSo, the tank can hold approximately 75,398.4 liters of water when filled to capacity.\n\nBut let's double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. First, confirming the radius: diameter is 4 meters, so radius is indeed 2 meters. Height is 6 meters. The volume formula for a cylinder is correct. Calculation steps seem accurate. Conversion from cubic meters to liters is straightforward multiplication by 1000.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer? Maybe using the formula for the area of the base and then multiplying by height.\n\nThe base is a circle with radius 2 meters, so area \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (2 \\, \\text{m})^2 = 4\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nThen, volume \\( V \\) is area times height:\n\n\\[ V = A \\times h = 4\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 6 \\, \\text{m} = 24\\pi \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nSame as before. Good.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the approximate value of \\( \\pi \\) early on:\n\n\\[ A \\approx 4 \\times 3.1416 = 12.5664 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 12.5664 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 6 \\, \\text{m} = 75.3984 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nAgain, same volume.\n\nConverting to liters:\n\n\\[ 75.3984 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\times 1000 \\, \\text{l/m}^3 = 75,398.4 \\, \\text{l} \\]\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of the tank's dimensions in meters and see if the units make sense. Volume in cubic meters, multiplied by 1000 to get liters, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 1 m\u00b3 = 1000 liters, and the volume is approximately 75.4 m\u00b3, then multiplying by 1000 should give around 75,400 liters, which matches my calculation.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the tank can hold approximately 75,398.4 liters of water when filled to capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75398.4} \\]"
