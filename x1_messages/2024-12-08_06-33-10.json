However, many people describe the sound of vinyl records as warm, rich, and full-bodied, with a certain character that digital formats lack. The sound can also be affected by factors such as the quality of the record, the condition it's in, and the equipment used to play it. Some people also appreciate the ritual and experience of listening to vinyl, from flipping the record to adjusting the needle."
