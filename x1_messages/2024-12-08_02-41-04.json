The Coriolis effect does influence the rotation of large-scale weather systems and ocean currents, but in everyday situations like draining water from a toilet or a bathtub, other factors like the shape of the basin and the way the water was introduced into it have a much bigger impact. The Coriolis force is too weak to determine the direction of such small-scale water movements."
