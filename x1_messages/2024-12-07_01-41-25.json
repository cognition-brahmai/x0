        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour and comes back at 40 miles per hour. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town A and Town B is, say, D miles. So, the total distance for the round trip would be 2D miles.\n\nNow, the time taken to go from A to B at 60 mph would be D divided by 60 hours, and the time to return from B to A at 40 mph would be D divided by 40 hours.\n\nSo, total time would be (D/60) + (D/40) hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, 60 and 40 both divide into 120.\n\nSo, D/60 is the same as 2D/120, and D/40 is the same as 3D/120.\n\nAdding them up, total time is (2D + 3D)/120 = 5D/120 = D/24 hours.\n\nNow, total distance is 2D miles, and total time is D/24 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance divided by total time: 2D divided by D/24.\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 2D * 24/D.\n\nThe D's cancel out, and we get 2 * 24 = 48 miles per hour.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this?\n\nI've heard of something called the harmonic mean for average speeds when the distances are the same but speeds are different.\n\nYeah, the harmonic mean for two speeds is 2*(speed1*speed2)/(speed1 + speed2).\n\nSo, plugging in the values: 2*(60*40)/(60 + 40) = 2*2400/100 = 4800/100 = 48 mph.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is 48 mph.\n\nI think that makes sense because the average speed should be closer to the slower speed since the train spends more time on the return trip.\n\nWait a minute, some people might think to just take the average of 60 and 40, which is 50 mph, but that's not correct in this case.\n\nBecause the train spends more time on the return trip at 40 mph, the average speed should be less than 50 mph, which it is, at 48 mph.\n\nSo, to summarize, the average speed for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
