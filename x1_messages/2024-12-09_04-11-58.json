        "content": "So I've got this problem here about designing staterooms for a new luxury cruise ship that can carry up to 5,000 passengers. The company wants to offer different types of rooms: inside cabins, ocean view cabins, and suites. They've specified that at least 60% of the staterooms should have an ocean view or better. My task is to figure out the best mix of these room types to maximize revenue, given the average nightly rates for each type.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It's about optimizing the distribution of different types of staterooms to maximize revenue, while ensuring that at least 60% of them offer an ocean view or are suites. The rates are $200 for inside cabins, $300 for ocean view, and $500 for suites.\n\nI think the first step is to determine the total number of staterooms on the ship. The ship has a maximum capacity of 5,000 passengers, but I need to know how many staterooms that translates to. Typically, staterooms can accommodate a certain number of passengers, like 2 or 4 per room. But the problem doesn't specify the capacity per room. Maybe I need to assume an average.\n\nLet's assume that each stateroom accommodates an average of 2 passengers. That would mean there are 5,000 / 2 = 2,500 staterooms on the ship. Is that a reasonable assumption? I'm not sure, but without specific information, I'll go with that for now.\n\nSo, total staterooms = 2,500.\n\nNow, at least 60% of these should have an ocean view or be suites. So, 60% of 2,500 is 1,500 rooms. That means there should be at least 1,500 rooms that are either ocean view or suites.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- I = number of inside cabins\n\n- O = number of ocean view cabins\n\n- S = number of suites\n\nWe have:\n\nI + O + S = 2,500\n\nAnd:\n\nO + S \u2265 1,500\n\nThe revenue is given by:\n\nRevenue = 200I + 300O + 500S\n\nOur goal is to maximize this revenue subject to the constraints.\n\nThis looks like a linear programming problem. In linear programming, we usually express the problem in terms of decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nSo, decision variables are I, O, S.\n\nObjective function: maximize 200I + 300O + 500S\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. I + O + S = 2,500\n\n2. O + S \u2265 1,500\n\n3. I, O, S \u2265 0 (since you can't have negative rooms)\n\nBut, I think there might be more constraints. For example, perhaps there are limits on how many suites or inside cabins can be built due to space or design considerations. But the problem doesn't specify any other constraints, so maybe these are the only ones.\n\nLet me see if I can visualize this. In linear programming, when you have equality constraints, you can sometimes express one variable in terms of others.\n\nFrom constraint 1: I = 2,500 - O - S\n\nSubstituting this into the objective function:\n\nRevenue = 200(2,500 - O - S) + 300O + 500S\n\n= 500,000 - 200O - 200S + 300O + 500S\n\n= 500,000 + 100O + 300S\n\nSo, Revenue = 500,000 + 100O + 300S\n\nNow, considering constraint 2: O + S \u2265 1,500\n\nI need to maximize 500,000 + 100O + 300S, given that O + S \u2265 1,500 and I = 2,500 - O - S \u2265 0.\n\nWait, I also have I \u2265 0, which means 2,500 - O - S \u2265 0, or O + S \u2264 2,500.\n\nSo, combining with O + S \u2265 1,500, we have:\n\n1,500 \u2264 O + S \u2264 2,500\n\nAlso, O and S must be non-negative.\n\nTo maximize Revenue = 500,000 + 100O + 300S, I need to maximize 100O + 300S.\n\nSince 300 > 100, to maximize this, I should maximize S as much as possible.\n\nSo, let's see, if I set S as high as possible, given the constraints.\n\nFrom 1,500 \u2264 O + S \u2264 2,500.\n\nTo maximize S, I should set O as low as possible.\n\nThe lowest O can be is 0 (assuming that's allowed).\n\nSo, if O = 0, then S \u2265 1,500 and S \u2264 2,500.\n\nSo, S can be up to 2,500.\n\nBut, if S = 2,500, then I = 2,500 - 0 - 2,500 = 0.\n\nSo, one possible solution is I = 0, O = 0, S = 2,500.\n\nLet's calculate the revenue:\n\nRevenue = 500,000 + 100*0 + 300*2,500 = 500,000 + 0 + 750,000 = 1,250,000\n\nIs this feasible? It meets O + S \u2265 1,500, since S = 2,500 \u2265 1,500.\n\nAnd I = 0, which is \u2265 0.\n\nSo, this seems to be a feasible solution.\n\nBut is this the only solution? Or are there better ones?\n\nWait, perhaps there are other combinations that could yield higher revenue.\n\nLet me consider if increasing O while decreasing S could increase revenue.\n\nLet's see, suppose I decrease S by 1 and increase O by 1.\n\nThen, S decreases by 1, so 300 less in revenue, but O increases by 1, adding 100 to revenue.\n\nNet change: -300 + 100 = -200.\n\nSo, revenue decreases.\n\nTherefore, increasing O at the expense of S decreases revenue.\n\nTherefore, the maximum revenue is achieved when S is maximized, which is S = 2,500, O = 0, I = 0.\n\nWait, but does that make sense in practice? Having no inside cabins at all?\n\nMaybe the company wants to have some inside cabins to offer lower price options.\n\nBut according to the mathematical model, maximizing revenue would involve having only suites.\n\nBut perhaps there are other constraints that aren't specified in the problem, like minimum number of inside cabins, or maximum number of suites due to space limitations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ship's design dictates certain proportions.\n\nBut based on the information given, the optimal distribution to maximize revenue while meeting the 60% ocean view or better requirement is to have all 2,500 staterooms as suites.\n\nLet me double-check the assumption about the number of staterooms.\n\nEarlier, I assumed 2,500 staterooms based on 5,000 passengers divided by 2 passengers per room.\n\nBut perhaps some rooms can accommodate more passengers.\n\nIf some rooms are for 4 passengers, then the total number of rooms would be lower.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider different room capacities.\n\nLet's suppose that the staterooms have different capacities:\n\n- Inside cabins: 2 passengers\n\n- Ocean view cabins: 3 passengers\n\n- Suites: 4 passengers\n\nThen, the total passenger capacity would be:\n\n2I + 3O + 4S = 5,000\n\nAnd the total number of rooms is I + O + S = unknown.\n\nIn this case, it's a bit more complicated.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the capacity per room type, so maybe all rooms are assumed to have the same number of passengers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps staterooms are all double occupancy.\n\nIn that case, 2,500 rooms for 5,000 passengers makes sense.\n\nBut if there are rooms with different capacities, the total number of rooms would be less.\n\nHowever, without specific information, I'll stick with the initial assumption of 2,500 rooms.\n\nAnother consideration is whether all rooms are always occupied. But since it's maximum capacity, assume they are all occupied.\n\nSo, in conclusion, to maximize revenue given the constraints, the optimal distribution is to have all 2,500 staterooms as suites, yielding a nightly revenue of $1,250,000.\n\nBut, I should consider if there are any practical limitations or other constraints that might prevent this.\n\nFor example, perhaps there is a limit to how many suites can be built due to space.\n\nOr maybe there are regulatory constraints on the number of suites.\n\nBut based on the information provided, this seems to be the optimal solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{All 2,500 staterooms should be suites to maximize revenue.}}"
