        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people waiting for a bus, and among them, there are 7 women. It also says that there are more than twice as many men as women. We need to find out the total number of people in the line.\n\nFirst, let's identify what we know:\n\n- Number of women (W) = 7\n\n- Number of men (M) > 2 times the number of women\n\nSo, M > 2 * W\n\nSince W = 7, then M > 2 * 7, which means M > 14\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of people, which is the sum of women and men:\n\nTotal people (P) = W + M\n\nWe know W is 7, but M is greater than 14. So, M could be 15, 16, 17, and so on.\n\nTherefore, P = 7 + M, where M > 14\n\nSo, P > 7 + 14\n\nP > 21\n\nTherefore, there are more than 21 people in total.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's more to this. The problem says \"more than twice as many men as women.\" So, M > 2W, which we've established is M > 14.\n\nBut in terms of total people, since M has to be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a person), M starts at 15 upwards.\n\nSo, possible totals are 7 + 15 = 22, 7 + 16 = 23, and so on.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify an upper limit, so technically, the total could be any number greater than 21.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let's see if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific number they're looking for, but based on the information given, it seems like the total is any number greater than 21.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that \"more than twice as many men as women\" could be interpreted strictly as M > 2W, which is M > 14, and since M has to be an integer, M \u2265 15.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible total is 7 + 15 = 22.\n\nAny number above that would also satisfy the condition, but 22 is the minimum total that meets the criteria.\n\nSo, the total number of people is at least 22.\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
