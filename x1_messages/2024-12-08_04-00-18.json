Each step in your plan should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions when given an appropriate input string.\n\nHere are the tools at your disposal:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: This tool enables users to conduct searches using DuckDuckGo. It is helpful for locating a variety of sites that may contain the answer to the user's query. This function does not directly provide an answer but identifies potential sources of answers.\nSiteReader[input]: This tool loads one or more websites from an input string containing newline-delimited links. The input consists of one or more links, and the output is plain text containing the content of these links.\nURLExtractor[input]: This tool extracts URLs from plain text and generates a plain text, newline-delimited list of URLs.\nLanguageModelQA[input]: This is a question-answering language model that excels at providing answers based on a given passage of text. The input should be a textual question referencing a :evidence[n]: variable, such as 'What is the dog's breed, given :evidence1:?'.\n\nInputs to these functions should be plain strings without quotation marks or '+' symbols used to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., LanguageModelQA[What is the population of New York City, given :evidence2:?].\n\nEnsure that each plan step includes only one evidence output.\n\nYour output should follow this structure:\nPlan: [First action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call with input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence, like 'Given context :evidence0']\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: What was the impact of Gutenberg's printing press on the Renaissance period?"

I should start by searching for general information on Gutenberg's printing press and its historical context.\n\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[Gutenberg's printing press impact on Renaissance]\n\nPlan: From the search results in :evidence0:, I need to identify key points about how the printing press influenced the Renaissance. It would be helpful to look for articles or sources that discuss the social, cultural, and intellectual impacts of the printing press during that time period.\n\n:evidence1: = URLExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: With the list of URLs from :evidence1:, I can select a few reliable sources to read in depth. I should choose sources that are known for their historical accuracy and scholarly insight.\n\n:evidence2: = SiteReader[:evidence1: (first 3 URLs)]\n\nPlan: Now that I have the content from these sources in :evidence2:, I need to extract the relevant information about the impact of the printing press on the Renaissance. I should look for paragraphs or sections that discuss changes in literature, education, and the spread of ideas.\n\n:evidence3: = LanguageModelQA[What were the main impacts of Gutenberg's printing press on the Renaissance period, given :evidence2:?]\n\nPlan: Based on the analysis in :evidence3:, I should summarize the key points.
