        "content": "Let's solve the equation 3(x - 2) = 6x + 9 step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to expand the left side of the equation. So, I'll distribute the 3 to both terms inside the parentheses:\n\n3 * x - 3 * 2 = 3x - 6.\n\nNow, the equation looks like this:\n\n3x - 6 = 6x + 9.\n\nNext, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Let's subtract 3x from both sides to move the x terms to the right:\n\n3x - 6 - 3x = 6x + 9 - 3x.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-6 = 3x + 9.\n\nNow, I'll subtract 9 from both sides to move the constant term to the left:\n\n-6 - 9 = 3x + 9 - 9.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-15 = 3x.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n-15 / 3 = 3x / 3.\n\nSo, x = -5.\n\nLet me check if this is correct by plugging x = -5 back into the original equation:\n\n3(-5 - 2) = 6*(-5) + 9.\n\nCalculating both sides:\n\n3*(-7) = -15.\n\nAnd 6*(-5) + 9 = -30 + 9 = -21.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n3(x - 2) = 6x + 9.\n\nExpanding left side:\n\n3x - 6 = 6x + 9.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n\n-6 = 3x + 9.\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n-15 = 3x.\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx = -5.\n\nBut when I plug it back in, 3(-5 - 2) = 3*(-7) = -21, and 6*(-5) + 9 = -30 + 9 = -21. Oh, wait, I must have miscalculated earlier. Yes, both sides equal -21, so x = -5 is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-5} \\]"
