She disappeared during an attempt to fly around the world in 1937, not while climbing Mount Everest in 1946.\n\nAmelia Earhart disappeared on July 2, 1937, while flying over the Pacific Ocean during her attempt to circumnavigate the globe along the equator. She and her navigator, Fred Noonan, were missing, and despite extensive search efforts, they were never found. This event remains one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in aviation history.\n\nMy source for this information is the History.com article on Amelia Earhart, which you can find at this URL: https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/amelia-earhart."
