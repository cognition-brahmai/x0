        "content": "So the amusement park has 15 rides right now, and together they can handle 3,000 riders every hour. They're adding a new roller coaster that should bump up their hourly capacity by 20%. I need to find out what the total capacity will be after this new ride is added, and then estimate how many more people might come to the park each day because of this increase.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the new hourly capacity. If they have a 20% increase in capacity, that means they're adding 20% of 3,000 riders per hour to the current capacity.\n\nSo, 20% of 3,000 is calculated as:\n\n0.20 \u00d7 3,000 = 600 riders per hour.\n\nSo, the new roller coaster will add 600 riders per hour to the existing capacity.\n\nNow, to find the total capacity after the new roller coaster is built, I add the additional capacity to the current capacity:\n\n3,000 + 600 = 3,600 riders per hour.\n\nThat's the new total capacity per hour.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the potential increase in daily visitors based on this information. To do that, I need to make some assumptions because the problem doesn't provide specific details about how capacity relates to the number of visitors.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how many hours the park is open each day. Let's assume the park is open for 10 hours a day. This is a common assumption, but it might be different depending on the park.\n\nSo, if the park is open for 10 hours, the total number of riders per day before the new roller coaster is:\n\n3,000 riders/hour \u00d7 10 hours = 30,000 riders per day.\n\nAfter the new roller coaster is added, the total capacity per day would be:\n\n3,600 riders/hour \u00d7 10 hours = 36,000 riders per day.\n\nThe increase in daily riders would be:\n\n36,000 - 30,000 = 6,000 riders per day.\n\nBut now, I need to think about how this increase in capacity translates to an increase in visitors. It's possible that the park was already operating at full capacity, meaning that all available rides were being used to their maximum every hour. In that case, the increase in capacity could directly translate to an increase in the number of visitors the park can handle each day.\n\nHowever, if the park wasn't operating at full capacity, meaning that there were spare slots in the rides, then adding more capacity might not necessarily lead to an increase in visitors, unless the park can attract more people with the new attraction.\n\nBut based on the information given, I'll assume that the park was previously operating at full capacity. Therefore, the increase in capacity should allow for an increase in the number of visitors proportional to the increase in capacity.\n\nSo, if the park could handle 30,000 riders per day before, and now can handle 36,000, that's an increase of 6,000 riders per day.\n\nBut, I need to consider that not all visitors ride the same number of times. Some might ride more, some less. Typically, amusement parks estimate the number of rides per visitor based on the length of their visit.\n\nLet's assume that the average visitor rides 5 times during their visit. This is just an assumption; the actual number could be different.\n\nIf the average visitor rides 5 times, then the number of visitors per day before the new roller coaster would be:\n\n30,000 riders per day \u00f7 5 rides per visitor = 6,000 visitors per day.\n\nAfter the capacity increases to 36,000 riders per day, the number of visitors would be:\n\n36,000 \u00f7 5 = 7,200 visitors per day.\n\nTherefore, the potential increase in daily visitors is:\n\n7,200 - 6,000 = 1,200 visitors per day.\n\nSo, based on this calculation, the park could potentially see an increase of 1,200 visitors per day.\n\nHowever, this is a simplified estimation. In reality, there are many other factors to consider:\n\n1. **Visitor Behavior:** Some visitors might ride more or less depending on the attractions available.\n\n2. **Seasonal Variations:** The number of visitors can fluctuate based on seasons, holidays, and other events.\n\n3. **Marketing and Promotion:** The new roller coaster might attract more visitors beyond just the increased capacity, depending on how it's promoted.\n\n4. **Convenience and Accessibility:** Factors like parking, queue times, and overall park experience can\u5f71\u54cd visitors' decisions.\n\n5. **Competition:** Other amusement parks or attractions in the area can also affect visitor numbers.\n\nDespite these complexities, based on the information provided and the assumptions made, the park could potentially see an increase of around 1,200 visitors per day after adding the new roller coaster.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
