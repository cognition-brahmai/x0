        "content": "In classical mechanics, the concept of conservation of momentum is fundamental. It states that the total momentum of a closed system is constant unless acted upon by an external force. For example, in a two-body collision, if one body gains momentum, the other must lose an equal amount of momentum to keep the total momentum constant. However, in quantum mechanics, particles can behave both as particles and waves, leading to phenomena like quantum entanglement, where particles become interconnected and the state of one can instantly affect the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. How does the principle of conservation of momentum apply in the context of quantum entanglement?\nA. It does not apply because quantum entanglement violates the principle of conservation of momentum\nB. It still applies because the total momentum of the entangled system remains constant\nC. It applies only if the entangled particles are not observed\nD. It applies differently because momentum is not conserved at the quantum level\nE. None of the above"

        "content": "Quantum entanglement is a fascinating phenomenon where particles become interconnected, and the state of one can instantaneously affect the state of the other, no matter the distance between them. This might seem to contradict the conservation of momentum, a fundamental principle in classical mechanics, but in reality, quantum mechanics fully respects this conservation law.\n\nLet's consider two entangled particles that are produced in a process where the total momentum is known. For instance, if two particles are emitted from a single source and are entangled, their combined momentum must be conserved. This means that the sum of their individual momenta must equal the total momentum before they were emitted.\n\nSuppose we have two entangled particles moving in opposite directions. If we measure the momentum of one particle, we instantly know the momentum of the other particle due to their entanglement. The principle of conservation of momentum ensures that the total momentum of the system remains constant.\n\nSo, even in the realm of quantum entanglement, the conservation of momentum holds true. The key is to consider the system as a whole. While individual particles may exhibit unpredictable behavior due to quantum uncertainty, the overall properties of the system, including its total momentum, are conserved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. It still applies because the total momentum of the entangled system remains constant"
