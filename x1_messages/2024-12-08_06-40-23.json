        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a city planning its public transportation system. They've got a budget of $50 million to buy buses and trains, and they want to maximize the passenger capacity while staying within that budget. Also, there are annual maintenance costs for each bus and train, which I need to consider. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the costs involved. Each bus costs $300,000 and each train costs $2 million. The total budget is $50 million. So, the equation for the budget constraint would be:\n\n300,000B + 2,000,000T \u2264 50,000,000\n\nWhere B is the number of buses and T is the number of trains.\n\nNext, I need to consider the passenger capacity. Each bus can hold 60 passengers, and each train can hold 500 passengers. So, the total passenger capacity would be:\n\n60B + 500T\n\nThis is what I need to maximize.\n\nAlso, there are annual maintenance costs: $10,000 per bus and $100,000 per train. I'm not sure if I need to factor this into the initial purchase decision, but maybe I should consider the overall cost including maintenance over time. But since the budget is only for the purchase, I'll treat maintenance as a separate annual expense.\n\nWait, maybe the city wants to consider not just the initial purchase but also the long-term maintenance costs. Perhaps I should look at the total cost over a certain period, say, 10 years, and maximize the passenger capacity while staying within that total cost.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about considering maintenance in the initial budget. It just says to stay within the $50 million budget for purchase costs and mentions maintenance costs separately. So, perhaps I should focus on maximizing passenger capacity within the $50 million purchase budget, and maybe consider maintenance as an ongoing expense.\n\nLet me see. If I were to ignore maintenance costs for now, and just focus on maximizing passenger capacity within the $50 million budget, I could set up this as a linear programming problem.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet B = number of buses\n\nT = number of trains\n\nObjective: Maximize P = 60B + 500T\n\nSubject to:\n\n300,000B + 2,000,000T \u2264 50,000,000\n\nB \u2265 0, T \u2265 0 (since you can't have negative buses or trains)\n\nThis seems straightforward. To solve this, I can find the feasible region defined by the budget constraint and non-negativity constraints, and then find the corner points to evaluate the objective function.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the budget constraint:\n\n300,000B + 2,000,000T \u2264 50,000,000\n\nI can divide the entire inequality by 100,000 to make it easier:\n\n3B + 20T \u2264 500\n\nNow, to find the intercepts:\n\nIf B = 0:\n\n20T \u2264 500 \u21d2 T \u2264 25\n\nIf T = 0:\n\n3B \u2264 500 \u21d2 B \u2264 500/3 \u2248 166.67\n\nSince B has to be an integer, B \u2264 166\n\nSo, the feasible region is all (B, T) pairs where B \u2264 166, T \u2264 25, and 3B + 20T \u2264 500.\n\nNow, the corner points of this feasible region are:\n\n(0,0): purchase no buses and no trains\n\n(166,0): purchase 166 buses and no trains\n\n(0,25): purchase 25 trains and no buses\n\nAnd the intersection point where 3B + 20T = 500, with B and T as integers.\n\nFirst, let's find the exact intersection point.\n\nFrom 3B + 20T = 500, solve for B:\n\nB = (500 - 20T)/3\n\nSince B has to be an integer, (500 - 20T) must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me find T such that (500 - 20T) mod 3 = 0.\n\nAlternatively, I can try values of T from 0 to 25 and see which ones satisfy this condition.\n\nLet me try T = 1:\n\n500 - 20*1 = 480, 480/3 = 160 \u2192 integer\n\nT = 2:\n\n500 - 40 = 460, 460/3 \u2248 153.333 \u2192 not integer\n\nT = 3:\n\n500 - 60 = 440, 440/3 \u2248 146.666 \u2192 not integer\n\nT = 4:\n\n500 - 80 = 420, 420/3 = 140 \u2192 integer\n\nSo, for T = 1, B = 160\n\nT = 4, B = 140\n\nT = 7, B = 120\n\nT = 10, B = 100\n\nT = 13, B = 80\n\nT = 16, B = 60\n\nT = 19, B = 40\n\nT = 22, B = 20\n\nT = 25, B = 0\n\nSo, the corner points are:\n\n(0,0), (166,0), (0,25), and the points where B and T are integers satisfying B = (500 - 20T)/3\n\nSo, potential points to evaluate are:\n\n(166,0), (160,1), (140,4), (120,7), (100,10), (80,13), (60,16), (40,19), (20,22), (0,25)\n\nNow, I need to calculate the passenger capacity P = 60B + 500T for each of these points.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n(166,0): P = 60*166 + 500*0 = 9960\n\n(160,1): P = 60*160 + 500*1 = 9600 + 500 = 10,100\n\n(140,4): P = 60*140 + 500*4 = 8400 + 2000 = 10,400\n\n(120,7): P = 60*120 + 500*7 = 7200 + 3500 = 10,700\n\n(100,10): P = 60*100 + 500*10 = 6000 + 5000 = 11,000\n\n(80,13): P = 60*80 + 500*13 = 4800 + 6500 = 11,300\n\n(60,16): P = 60*60 + 500*16 = 3600 + 8000 = 11,600\n\n(40,19): P = 60*40 + 500*19 = 2400 + 9500 = 11,900\n\n(20,22): P = 60*20 + 500*22 = 1200 + 11,000 = 12,200\n\n(0,25): P = 60*0 + 500*25 = 12,500\n\nSo, according to this, the maximum passenger capacity is 12,500 with 0 buses and 25 trains.\n\nBut wait a minute, is that within the budget?\n\nLet's check the cost:\n\nCost = 300,000*B + 2,000,000*T\n\nFor (0,25): Cost = 0 + 2,000,000*25 = 50,000,000 \u2192 exactly on budget.\n\nSimilarly, for (20,22): Cost = 300,000*20 + 2,000,000*22 = 6,000,000 + 44,000,000 = 50,000,000\n\n(40,19): 300,000*40 + 2,000,000*19 = 12,000,000 + 38,000,000 = 50,000,000\n\nAnd so on for the other points.\n\nSo, all these points are on the budget constraint.\n\nTherefore, the maximum passenger capacity is 12,500 with 0 buses and 25 trains.\n\nBut, is this the optimal solution?\n\nWait, looking back at the calculations, it seems that as T increases, P increases, and B decreases accordingly.\n\nSo, the more trains you buy, the higher the passenger capacity, given the budget.\n\nBut is that always the case?\n\nLet me check the passenger capacity per dollar spent for buses and trains.\n\nFor buses:\n\nCost per bus: $300,000\n\nPassenger capacity per bus: 60\n\nSo, cost per passenger: 300,000 / 60 = $5,000 per passenger\n\nFor trains:\n\nCost per train: $2,000,000\n\nPassenger capacity per train: 500\n\nSo, cost per passenger: 2,000,000 / 500 = $4,000 per passenger\n\nHmm, so trains are more cost-effective in terms of cost per passenger.\n\nThat's why in the optimization, it's better to buy more trains and fewer buses to maximize passenger capacity within the budget.\n\nBut, perhaps there is a trade-off with maintenance costs.\n\nThe problem mentions annual maintenance costs: $10,000 per bus and $100,000 per train.\n\nMaybe the city wants to consider not just the initial purchase but also the long-term maintenance costs.\n\nIf I consider, for example, a 10-year period, I could calculate the total cost including maintenance and see how that affects the passenger capacity.\n\nLet me explore that.\n\nAssume the city wants to look at the total cost over 10 years, including both purchase and maintenance costs.\n\nThen, the total cost would be:\n\nTotal cost = purchase cost + 10 * (maintenance cost per year)\n\nFor buses:\n\nPurchase: $300,000\n\nMaintenance per year: $10,000\n\nTotal cost over 10 years: 300,000 + 10*10,000 = 300,000 + 100,000 = $400,000\n\nFor trains:\n\nPurchase: $2,000,000\n\nMaintenance per year: $100,000\n\nTotal cost over 10 years: 2,000,000 + 10*100,000 = 2,000,000 + 1,000,000 = $3,000,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost per passenger over 10 years.\n\nFor buses:\n\nTotal cost: $400,000\n\nPassengers: 60\n\nCost per passenger: 400,000 / 60 \u2248 $6,666.67\n\nFor trains:\n\nTotal cost: $3,000,000\n\nPassengers: 500\n\nCost per passenger: 3,000,000 / 500 = $6,000\n\nSo, even considering the maintenance costs, trains are still more cost-effective per passenger.\n\nTherefore, to maximize passenger capacity within a certain budget, it's better to buy as many trains as possible, given that they offer a lower cost per passenger.\n\nBut, in reality, there might be other factors to consider, such as infrastructure requirements for trains versus buses, route flexibility, etc.\n\nBut based solely on the numbers provided, it seems that purchasing only trains would maximize passenger capacity within the budget.\n\nHowever, perhaps the city has some constraints or preferences that aren't specified in the problem, such as a mix of both for diversity or other reasons.\n\nBut according to the mathematical optimization, buying 25 trains and no buses would maximize passenger capacity within the $50 million budget.\n\nLet me just double-check the numbers.\n\nCost of 25 trains: 25 * 2,000,000 = 50,000,000 \u2192 exactly the budget.\n\nPassenger capacity: 25 * 500 = 12,500\n\nAlternatively, with buses:\n\n166 buses: cost 166 * 300,000 = 49,800,000 \u2192 almost 50 million.\n\nPassenger capacity: 166 * 60 = 9,960\n\nWhich is less than 12,500.\n\nOr a combination:\n\nLike 20 buses and 22 trains:\n\nCost: 20*300,000 + 22*2,000,000 = 6,000,000 + 44,000,000 = 50,000,000\n\nPassenger capacity: 20*60 + 22*500 = 1,200 + 11,000 = 12,200\n\nStill less than 12,500.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations give lower passenger capacity than 12,500.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to purchase 25 trains and 0 buses.\n\nBut, perhaps the city has other considerations, like covering different types of routes, or having a mix of public transport options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are capacity constraints on the train tracks or something like that.\n\nBut based solely on the information provided, the optimal number is 0 buses and 25 trains.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0 \\text{ buses and } 25 \\text{ trains}} \\]"
