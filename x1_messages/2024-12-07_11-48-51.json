        "content": "So in this group of 50 people, 30% have blue eyes, 40% have brown eyes, and the rest have green eyes. I need to find out how many have green eyes.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many people have blue eyes. Since 30% have blue eyes, I can calculate that by taking 30% of 50. To find 30% of 50, I can multiply 50 by 0.30.\n\n50 * 0.30 = 15\n\nSo, 15 people have blue eyes.\n\nNext, I'll find out how many have brown eyes. 40% have brown eyes, so I'll calculate 40% of 50.\n\n50 * 0.40 = 20\n\nSo, 20 people have brown eyes.\n\nNow, to find out how many have green eyes, I can subtract the number of people with blue and brown eyes from the total number of people in the group.\n\nTotal people = 50\n\nPeople with blue eyes = 15\n\nPeople with brown eyes = 20\n\nSo, people with green eyes = total people - (people with blue eyes + people with brown eyes)\n\nPeople with green eyes = 50 - (15 + 20) = 50 - 35 = 15\n\nTherefore, 15 people in the group have green eyes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nI know that percentages add up to 100%, so if 30% have blue eyes and 40% have brown eyes, that's 70% in total.\n\nSo, the remaining percentage must have green eyes.\n\n100% - 70% = 30%\n\nSo, 30% of the group has green eyes.\n\nNow, to find 30% of 50:\n\n50 * 0.30 = 15\n\nAgain, that's 15 people.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 15 people have green eyes.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
