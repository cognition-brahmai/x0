        "content": "Let's see. So, the boat rental costs $100 for the first hour and then $50 for each additional hour. They want to rent it for 6 hours. I need to calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, I'll note down the charges:\n\n- First hour: $100\n\n- Each additional hour: $50\n\nThey want to rent it for 6 hours. So, the first hour is $100, and the remaining 5 hours are additional hours at $50 each.\n\nSo, the cost for the additional hours would be 5 hours times $50 per hour.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n5 hours * $50/hour = $250\n\nNow, I'll add that to the first hour's charge:\n\n$100 (first hour) + $250 (additional hours) = $350\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal rental time: 6 hours\n\nCharge structure:\n\n- Hour 1: $100\n\n- Hour 2: $50\n\n- Hour 3: $50\n\n- Hour 4: $50\n\n- Hour 5: $50\n\n- Hour 6: $50\n\nSo, $100 + $50 + $50 + $50 + $50 + $50\n\nThat's $100 plus five times $50.\n\n$100 + 5*$50 = $100 + $250 = $350\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nTotal cost = $100 + ($50 * (total hours - 1))\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal cost = $100 + ($50 * (6 - 1)) = $100 + ($50 * 5) = $100 + $250 = $350\n\nSame answer.\n\nWait, is there another way to look at it? Maybe considering the average cost per hour.\n\nFirst hour is $100, and the next five are $50 each.\n\nTotal cost is $100 + $50*5 = $350\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they have a different pricing structure, but according to the information provided, it's $100 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour.\n\nSo, for 6 hours, it should be $350.\n\nBut let me think if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any mention of a maximum charge or any discounts for longer rentals? No, the problem states simply $100 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour.\n\nAlso, it's for 6 hours, which is a full-day rental, but unless specified otherwise, I'll go with the given charges.\n\nAnother way to confirm is to calculate the cost per hour on average.\n\nTotal cost is $350 for 6 hours, which is approximately $58.33 per hour on average, but that's not necessary for the calculation.\n\nThe question is straightforward: find the total cost for 6 hours with the given charges.\n\nSo, the total cost is $350.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{350} \\]"
