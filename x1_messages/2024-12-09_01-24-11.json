        "content": "Let's see. The company currently has 120 employees and expects to hire 50% more within the next year. So first, I need to calculate how many additional employees they will hire.\n\n50% of 120 is calculated as 0.5 times 120, which is 60. So they will hire 60 more employees.\n\nNow, the total number of employees after hiring will be the current number plus the additional hires: 120 plus 60 equals 180 employees.\n\nEach laptop costs $800, so to find out the total cost for all laptops, I need to multiply the number of employees by the cost per laptop: 180 times 800.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 180 times 800.\n\nFirst, 100 times 800 is 80,000.\n\nThen, 80 times 800 is 64,000.\n\nAdding those together: 80,000 plus 64,000 equals 144,000.\n\nSo, the company should budget $144,000 for the laptops if they plan to buy them all at once.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nCurrent employees: 120\n\nAdditional hires: 50% of 120 is 60\n\nTotal employees after hires: 120 + 60 = 180\n\nCost per laptop: $800\n\nTotal cost: 180 times 800\n\nYes, 180 times 800 is indeed 144,000.\n\nSo, the answer is $144,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144000} \\]"
