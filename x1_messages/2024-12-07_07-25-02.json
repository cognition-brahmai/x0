The name \"Oklahoma\" is derived from the Choctaw words \"okla\" meaning \"people\" and \"humma\" meaning \"red\". So, \"oklahumma\" translates to \"red people\". The Choctaw people were one of the Native American tribes that were relocated to the region that is now Oklahoma in the 19th century, and the name was officially adopted when it became a state in 1907."
