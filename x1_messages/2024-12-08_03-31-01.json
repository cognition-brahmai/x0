We need to find out how far apart these cities are.\n\nWell, to find the distance when we know the speed and time, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nHere, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 3 hours. So, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours\n\nWhen you multiply these, the 'hours' unit cancels out, leaving us with miles.\n\nSo, Distance = 180 miles\n\nTherefore, the two cities are 180 miles apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
