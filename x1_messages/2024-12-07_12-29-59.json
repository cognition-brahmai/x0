        "content": "So, if a car gets 25 miles per gallon and has a 15-gallon fuel tank, to find out how far it can travel on a full tank before running out of gas, I think I just need to multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank.\n\nSo, that would be 25 miles/gallon times 15 gallons. The gallons unit cancels out, leaving miles. So, 25 times 15 equals 375 miles.\n\nTherefore, the car can travel 375 miles on a full tank before running out of gas.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if the tank might not be completely empty at the end, like if there's a reserve. But since the question says \"before running out of gas,\" I think it means completely empty. So, 375 miles should be the answer.\n\nStill, in real life, cars sometimes have a reserve tank or something, but according to the information given, it's a 15-gallon tank, so I think 375 miles is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the miles per gallon is measured in city driving or highway driving, but since that's not specified, I'll assume it's under normal driving conditions as per the car's specifications.\n\nAlso, fuel efficiency can vary based on how the car is driven, but again, since it's given as 25 miles per gallon, I'll take that as a constant for this calculation.\n\nSo, final answer: 375 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
