        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $1.20 per pound and oranges for $0.90 per pound. The customer buys 5 pounds of apples and 3 pounds of oranges. I need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the apples. Apples are $1.20 per pound, and the customer buys 5 pounds. So, the cost for apples is 1.20 multiplied by 5.\n\nSimilarly, for oranges, they are $0.90 per pound, and the customer buys 3 pounds. So, the cost for oranges is 0.90 multiplied by 3.\n\nThen, I'll add both amounts to get the total cost.\n\nLet me do the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, apples:\n\n1.20 \u00d7 5 = 6.00\n\nSo, the apples cost $6.00.\n\nNext, oranges:\n\n0.90 \u00d7 3 = 2.70\n\nSo, the oranges cost $2.70.\n\nNow, adding both amounts:\n\n6.00 + 2.70 = 8.70\n\nTherefore, the total amount the customer will spend on fruit is $8.70.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8.70} \\]"
