        "content": "The Roman emperor who initiated the persecution of Christians after blaming them for the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD was Nero. He was the fifth emperor of the Roman Empire and reigned from 54 to 68 AD. The fire destroyed much of the city, including several important buildings and residences. In an attempt to divert blame from himself, Nero accused the Christians of starting the fire, leading to widespread persecution and brutal executions. This period marked one of the earliest and most notorious instances of Christian persecution in Roman history."
