        "content": "Let's see. First, I need to figure out how many hours are in a non-leap year. A non-leap year has 365 days, right? And each day has 24 hours. So, total hours in a year would be 365 days times 24 hours per day.\n\nSo, 365 \u00d7 24 = let's calculate that. 300 \u00d7 24 = 7200, and 65 \u00d7 24. 60 \u00d7 24 = 1440, and 5 \u00d7 24 = 120. So, 1440 + 120 = 1560. Now, 7200 + 1560 = 8760 hours in a year.\n\nNow, if the factory produces 15 cars per hour, then in 8760 hours, it would produce 15 \u00d7 8760 cars.\n\nLet me calculate that. 15 \u00d7 8760.\n\nWell, 10 \u00d7 8760 = 87,600.\n\nAnd 5 \u00d7 8760 = 43,800.\n\nSo, total cars produced in a year would be 87,600 + 43,800 = 131,400 cars.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, hours in a non-leap year: 365 days \u00d7 24 hours/day = 8,760 hours.\n\nThen, cars produced per hour: 15 cars.\n\nSo, total cars in a year: 15 \u00d7 8,760.\n\nYes, 10 \u00d7 8,760 = 87,600.\n\n5 \u00d7 8,760 = 43,800.\n\nAdding them up: 87,600 + 43,800 = 131,400 cars.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of days. If the factory produces 15 cars per hour, and it operates 24 hours a day, then per day it produces 15 \u00d7 24 = 360 cars.\n\nThen, in 365 days, it would produce 360 \u00d7 365.\n\nLet me calculate that to verify.\n\n360 \u00d7 365.\n\nFirst, 300 \u00d7 365 = 109,500.\n\n60 \u00d7 365 = 21,900.\n\nSo, total = 109,500 + 21,900 = 131,400 cars.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory produces 131,400 cars in a non-leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{131400} \\]"
