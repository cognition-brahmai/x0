        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a bakery sells cookies in packs of 3, 5, and 7. I can only buy one pack at a time, and I need to find the smallest number of cookies I can purchase so that I have an equal number of each type of cookie. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to have an equal number of each type of cookie. That means the total number of cookies from packs of 3 should be equal to the number from packs of 5, which should also be equal to the number from packs of 7.\n\nWait, but packs are of fixed sizes: 3, 5, and 7 cookies each. So, if I buy one pack of 3, I get 3 cookies; one pack of 5 gives me 5 cookies; and one pack of 7 gives me 7 cookies. But I can only buy one pack at a time, which means I can buy multiple packs of the same size if I want.\n\nBut the problem says I can only buy one pack at a time, but it doesn't specify that I can't buy multiple packs of the same type. So, I can buy as many packs of each type as I want, just one at a time.\n\nSo, let's say I buy 'a' packs of 3, 'b' packs of 5, and 'c' packs of 7. Then, the total number of cookies from each type would be:\n\n- From packs of 3: 3a\n\n- From packs of 5: 5b\n\n- From packs of 7: 7c\n\nAnd I need these to be equal:\n\n3a = 5b = 7c\n\nAnd I need to find the smallest number of cookies, which would be the sum of these, but since they are equal, maybe I need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because I need the number of cookies from each type to be equal, not the total number of cookies to be a multiple of all three.\n\nLet me think differently. If 3a = 5b = 7c, then let's call this common number x. So, 3a = x, 5b = x, and 7c = x.\n\nThat means x is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7. So, x must be a common multiple of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nThe smallest such x would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nLet's calculate the LCM of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each number:\n\n- 3 is prime.\n\n- 5 is prime.\n\n- 7 is prime.\n\nSince they are all primes and distinct, the LCM is just their product:\n\nLCM(3,5,7) = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105\n\nSo, x = 105\n\nThat means, the number of cookies from each type should be 105.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Is there a smaller number?\n\nLet me check if there's a smaller common multiple.\n\nWell, LCM is the smallest such number, so 105 is the smallest x that is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nSo, to have 105 cookies from each type:\n\n- From packs of 3: 3a = 105 \u21d2 a = 105 / 3 = 35 packs\n\n- From packs of 5: 5b = 105 \u21d2 b = 105 / 5 = 21 packs\n\n- From packs of 7: 7c = 105 \u21d2 c = 105 / 7 = 15 packs\n\nSo, total number of cookies would be 105 from each type, totaling 105 * 3 = 315 cookies.\n\nBut is there a way to have a smaller total number of cookies while still having an equal number from each type?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me read it again: \"what is the smallest number of cookies you can purchase that will give you an equal number of each type of cookie?\"\n\nHmm, maybe it's not about having the same total number of cookies from each type, but having the same number of each individual cookie type.\n\nWait, but the packs contain multiple cookies. So, if I buy a pack of 3, it has 3 cookies, but they are all of one type, right?\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"packs of 3, 5, and 7,\" but it doesn't specify that these are different types of cookies. It just says \"each type of cookie.\"\n\nWait, maybe I need to interpret it differently.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully: \"a bakery sells cookies in packs of 3, 5, and 7. If you can only buy one pack at a time, what is the smallest number of cookies you can purchase that will give you an equal number of each type of cookie?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps \"each type of cookie\" refers to the different pack sizes, i.e., packs of 3, packs of 5, and packs of 7, and I need to have an equal number of packs of each type.\n\nBut that wouldn't make sense because packs contain different numbers of cookies, so the total number of cookies wouldn't be equal.\n\nWait, maybe \"each type of cookie\" refers to individual cookies, and I need to have an equal number of individual cookies from each pack type.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me consider that each pack contains cookies of a specific type. So, pack of 3 has type A cookies, pack of 5 has type B cookies, and pack of 7 has type C cookies.\n\nThen, to have an equal number of each type of cookie, I need to have the same number of type A, B, and C cookies.\n\nSo, if I buy 'a' packs of 3 (type A), 'b' packs of 5 (type B), and 'c' packs of 7 (type C), then:\n\nNumber of type A cookies: 3a\n\nNumber of type B cookies: 5b\n\nNumber of type C cookies: 7c\n\nAnd I need 3a = 5b = 7c\n\nAnd I need to find the smallest total number of cookies, which would be 3a + 5b + 7c.\n\nBut since 3a = 5b = 7c, let's call this common number x.\n\nSo, 3a = x, 5b = x, 7c = x.\n\nThen, a = x/3, b = x/5, c = x/7.\n\nSince a, b, c have to be integers (you can't buy a fraction of a pack), x must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nSo, x is a common multiple of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 5, and 7 is 105, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, x = 105.\n\nThen, a = 105 / 3 = 35 packs of 3\n\nb = 105 / 5 = 21 packs of 5\n\nc = 105 / 7 = 15 packs of 7\n\nTotal cookies: 3*35 + 5*21 + 7*15 = 105 + 105 + 105 = 315 cookies.\n\nBut is there a way to have a smaller total number of cookies while still having an equal number of each type?\n\nWait, maybe I can have multiple of the smallest x.\n\nFor example, x = 105 is the smallest x that satisfies 3a = 5b = 7c.\n\nBut perhaps there is a smaller total number of cookies if I consider that I can have multiple of these packs.\n\nWait, no. If I take x = 105, then total cookies are 315.\n\nIf I take x = 210, then a = 70, b = 42, c = 30, total cookies = 630, which is larger.\n\nSo, 315 is smaller.\n\nBut I have a feeling that there might be a smaller total number of cookies.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I buy a certain number of packs of each type, but not necessarily the same number of packs for each type.\n\nI need the total number of type A cookies equal to the total number of type B cookies equal to the total number of type C cookies.\n\nSo, again, 3a = 5b = 7c.\n\nWe already found that the smallest x is 105, leading to a = 35, b = 21, c = 15, total cookies 315.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way to combine the packs to get a smaller total.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a combination where the number of type A cookies equals the number of type B cookies, and that equals the number of type C cookies, but without all of them being equal to x.\n\nWait, but in the previous approach, x is the number of cookies of each type.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can have different numbers of packs but still end up with the same number of cookies from each type.\n\nLet me try to find smaller values of a, b, c such that 3a = 5b = 7c.\n\nThis seems like solving for the least common multiple again, which brings us back to x = 105.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of type A cookies is equal to the number of type B cookies, and that is equal to the number of type C cookies, but perhaps not the same as x.\n\nWait, no, in the previous approach, x is the number of cookies of each type.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the number of cookies per type.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me consider that I need to have y cookies of each type, where y is the same for all types.\n\nThen, the number of packs needed for each type would be:\n\n- Type A: y / 3 packs\n\n- Type B: y / 5 packs\n\n- Type C: y / 7 packs\n\nAnd since I can only buy whole packs, y must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nSo again, y must be a common multiple of 3, 5, and 7, and the least such y is 105.\n\nSo, y = 105 cookies of each type.\n\nTotal cookies: 3 * 105 = 315.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to have fewer total cookies by having different numbers of cookies per type, but still equal in some way.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"equal number of each type of cookie,\" which probably means the same number of cookies of each type.\n\nSo, in that case, 105 of each type, total 315 cookies, seems to be the smallest possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can have different numbers of cookies per type, but still consider them \"equal\" in some other sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"equal number of each type of cookie.\"\n\nPerhaps it means that the total number of cookies is divisible by each type's pack size.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it means that the total number of cookies can be divided into packs of 3, 5, and 7 in such a way that the number of packs of each type is equal.\n\nWait, that could be a possibility.\n\nSo, if I have the same number of packs of each type, say n packs of each type, then total cookies would be 3n + 5n + 7n = 15n.\n\nAnd I need to find the smallest total number of cookies, which would be 15n for some integer n.\n\nBut in this case, the number of cookies from each type is different: 3n, 5n, and 7n.\n\nSo, they are not equal.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"equal number of each type of cookie,\" which probably means the same number of cookies of each type.\n\nSo, this interpretation might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"equal number of each type of cookie\" means that the total number of cookies is divided equally among the three types.\n\nBut again, that would mean that the number of cookies per type is the same.\n\nSo, it seems that the first approach is correct: find the smallest x such that x is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7, which is LCM(3,5,7) = 105.\n\nThen, total cookies are 3 * 105 = 315.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of cookies I can purchase to have an equal number of each type is 315.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
