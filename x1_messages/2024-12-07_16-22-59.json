        "content": "So, we've got this bacteria colony that's doubling its population every hour, and it starts with 10 bacteria. We need to figure out how many there will be after 12 hours. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the colony to double every hour. So, if it starts with 10 bacteria, after one hour, it would have 20, right? Because it doubles. Then, after two hours, it would double again to 40, and so on.\n\nSo, it seems like this is a case of exponential growth, where the population multiplies by a fixed factor at regular time intervals. In this case, the factor is 2, and the time interval is one hour.\n\nI recall that the formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times r^{t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P(t) \\) is the population at time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate (the factor by which it multiplies each period),\n\n- \\( t \\) is the number of time periods.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( P_0 = 10 \\) (starting with 10 bacteria),\n\n- \\( r = 2 \\) (doubling every hour),\n\n- \\( t = 12 \\) hours.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(12) = 10 \\times 2^{12} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 2^{12} \\). Let's see:\n\n\\[ 2^1 = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^5 = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^6 = 64 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^8 = 256 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^9 = 512 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{11} = 2048 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{12} = 4096 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\).\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial population:\n\n\\[ P(12) = 10 \\times 4096 = 40960 \\]\n\nTherefore, after 12 hours, there will be 40,960 bacteria.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Exponential growth can get really big really fast, so maybe I should verify my calculations.\n\nStarting with 10 bacteria:\n\n- After 1 hour: 10 \u00d7 2 = 20\n\n- After 2 hours: 20 \u00d7 2 = 40\n\n- After 3 hours: 40 \u00d7 2 = 80\n\n- After 4 hours: 80 \u00d7 2 = 160\n\n- After 5 hours: 160 \u00d7 2 = 320\n\n- After 6 hours: 320 \u00d7 2 = 640\n\n- After 7 hours: 640 \u00d7 2 = 1280\n\n- After 8 hours: 1280 \u00d7 2 = 2560\n\n- After 9 hours: 2560 \u00d7 2 = 5120\n\n- After 10 hours: 5120 \u00d7 2 = 10,240\n\n- After 11 hours: 10,240 \u00d7 2 = 20,480\n\n- After 12 hours: 20,480 \u00d7 2 = 40,960\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 40,960 bacteria after 12 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of exponents. Starting with 10 bacteria, and doubling every hour, is like multiplying by 2 for each hour that passes. So, after 12 hours, that's 12 doublings, which is \\( 2^{12} \\) times the initial amount.\n\nI know that \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\), and \\( 2^{12} = 2^{10} \\times 2^2 = 1024 \\times 4 = 4096 \\). Then, 10 times that is indeed 40,960.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is using the formula for exponential growth. The general formula is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times e^{rt} \\]\n\nWhere \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm, and \\( r \\) is the growth rate.\n\nBut in this case, since the population is doubling every hour, it's more straightforward to use the formula I used earlier, which is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times r^{t} \\]\n\nWhere \\( r \\) is the multiplication factor per time period.\n\nI think the first approach is correct. So, the answer should be 40,960 bacteria after 12 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe the doubling is not discrete per hour but continuous. In that case, we might use the continuous exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times e^{kt} \\]\n\nWhere \\( k \\) is the continuous growth rate.\n\nHowever, in the context of bacteria doubling every hour, it's more common to use the discrete model, where the population doubles at the end of each hour.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, I'll stick with the discrete model.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the bacteria keep doubling without any limitations, such as food supply or space. In real life, bacteria growth is often limited by resources, and it follows a logistic growth curve. But in this problem, it seems we're to assume unlimited growth.\n\nSo, under the assumptions given, the population after 12 hours is 40,960 bacteria.\n\nLet me box the final answer:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40960} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40960} \\]"
