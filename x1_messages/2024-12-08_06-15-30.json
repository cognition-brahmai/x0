        "content": "Parkour is a physical discipline that originated in France in the late 1980s. It was founded by David Belle, who was inspired by the military training methods of his father, Raymond Belle. The core idea behind parkour is to move efficiently and effectively through any environment, overcoming physical obstacles along the way.\n\nThere are three key principles that guide the practice of parkour:\n\n1. **Efficiency:** Parkour emphasizes moving in the most direct and efficient way possible. This means choosing the quickest and safest path to reach a destination, considering factors like distance, time, and energy expenditure.\n\n2. **Adaptability:** Practitioners of parkour must be able to adapt to any environment, whether it's an urban setting with buildings and obstacles or a natural landscape with trees and rocks. This requires a broad skill set and the ability to think creatively about how to navigate different terrains.\n\n3. **Self-improvement:** Parkour is not just about physical movement; it's also about personal growth and development. Practitioners aim to push their limits, build resilience, and develop mental toughness through the challenges they face in their training.\n\nThese principles have helped parkour evolve into a global movement with a dedicated community of practitioners who share a passion for movement, creativity, and self-improvement."
