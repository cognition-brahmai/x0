        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a water tank with 600 gallons of water, and there's a faucet that drains water from it at a rate of 5 gallons per minute. I need to figure out how long it will take to empty the tank completely.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that the tank starts with 600 gallons, and the faucet is removing water at a constant rate of 5 gallons every minute. So, I need to find out how many minutes it will take for the tank to go from 600 gallons to 0 gallons.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use the formula for time, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{total amount}}{\\text{rate}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the total amount is the volume of water in the tank, which is 600 gallons, and the rate is the draining rate, which is 5 gallons per minute. So, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{600 \\text{ gallons}}{5 \\text{ gallons per minute}} \\]\n\nNow, when I do the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, it should take 120 minutes to empty the tank completely.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check. The draining rate is constant at 5 gallons per minute, and there are no other factors mentioned, like additional water being added or any changes in the draining rate. So, yes, the calculation seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it differently. If the faucet drains 5 gallons every minute, then in one minute, the tank loses 5 gallons. So, starting from 600 gallons:\n\nAfter 1 minute: 600 - 5 = 595 gallons\n\nAfter 2 minutes: 595 - 5 = 590 gallons\n\n...\n\nI can see that this is a linear relationship, where the amount of water decreases by 5 gallons for each passing minute.\n\nTo find out when the tank is empty, I can set up an equation. Let's let \\( t \\) be the time in minutes. Then, the amount of water left in the tank at any time \\( t \\) would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{water left} = 600 - 5t \\]\n\nTo find when the tank is empty, set the water left equal to zero:\n\n\\[ 0 = 600 - 5t \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 5t = 600 \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{600}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ t = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nAgain, I get 120 minutes. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. If 5 gallons are drained per minute, then for 600 gallons, the time would be proportional. So, 600 divided by 5 is indeed 120 minutes.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe the faucet isn't draining continuously, but in intervals. However, the problem states that the faucet drains water at a rate of 5 gallons per minute, which suggests a constant draining rate. So, no, that doesn't change anything.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. The tank's volume is given in gallons, and the draining rate is in gallons per minute, so the units are consistent, and the result is in minutes, which makes sense.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 120 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
