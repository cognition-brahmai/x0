        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. There's a square garden that measures 15 feet on each side, and Mary wants to build a circular fountain in the center that will cover 25% of the garden's area. I need to find out what the radius of that fountain should be.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the area of the garden. Since it's a square, the area is just the side length squared, right? So, that would be 15 feet times 15 feet, which is 225 square feet.\n\nNow, the fountain is supposed to cover 25% of the garden's area. So, I need to find 25% of 225 square feet. To do that, I can multiply 225 by 0.25. Let me do that: 225 times 0.25 is 56.25 square feet. So, the area of the fountain is 56.25 square feet.\n\nThe fountain is circular, so its area is given by the formula A equals pi times the radius squared, or A = \u03c0r\u00b2. I know the area A is 56.25 square feet, so I can set up the equation like this:\n\n56.25 = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to solve for r, the radius. First, I'll divide both sides of the equation by \u03c0 to isolate r\u00b2:\n\n56.25 / \u03c0 = r\u00b2\n\nLet me calculate that. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 56.25 divided by 3.1416 is about 17.9049. So, r\u00b2 is approximately 17.9049.\n\nNext, I need to take the square root of both sides to solve for r:\n\nr = \u221a17.9049\n\nLet me calculate that. The square root of 17.9049 is approximately 4.23 feet.\n\nSo, the radius of the fountain should be about 4.23 feet.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if this makes sense. The garden is 15 feet on each side, so the diagonal would be longer, but the fountain is in the center, and it's circular, so the radius should be less than half the side length of the square to fit entirely within the garden.\n\nHalf of 15 feet is 7.5 feet, so a radius of 4.23 feet should fit comfortably within the garden.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, area of the square garden: 15 feet * 15 feet = 225 square feet. That's correct.\n\nThen, 25% of 225 square feet: 225 * 0.25 = 56.25 square feet. That's correct.\n\nThen, A = \u03c0r\u00b2, so r\u00b2 = A / \u03c0 = 56.25 / \u03c0 \u2248 56.25 / 3.1416 \u2248 17.9049. That seems right.\n\nFinally, r = \u221a17.9049 \u2248 4.23 feet. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the radius of the fountain should be approximately 4.23 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.23 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
