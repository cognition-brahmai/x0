        "content": "Let's see. There are three types of cars: compact, midsize, and full-size. The ratio given is 3:2:1 for compact to midsize to full-size cars, and the total number of cars is 120.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio tells us how much of one thing there is compared to another. In this case, for every 3 compact cars, there are 2 midsize cars and 1 full-size car.\n\nSo, if I think of the ratio as parts, compact cars have 3 parts, midsize have 2 parts, and full-size have 1 part. To find out how many cars of each type there are, I need to figure out what each part represents in terms of actual cars.\n\nLet's add up the parts:\n\n3 (compact) + 2 (midsize) + 1 (full-size) = 6 parts in total.\n\nNow, these 6 parts represent the total number of cars, which is 120.\n\nSo, to find the value of one part, I can divide the total number of cars by the total number of parts:\n\n120 cars \u00f7 6 parts = 20 cars per part.\n\nNow that I know each part represents 20 cars, I can find the number of cars for each type:\n\n- Compact cars: 3 parts \u00d7 20 cars per part = 60 cars\n\n- Midsize cars: 2 parts \u00d7 20 cars per part = 40 cars\n\n- Full-size cars: 1 part \u00d7 20 cars per part = 20 cars\n\nLet me check if this adds up to the total:\n\n60 + 40 + 20 = 120 cars. Perfect!\n\nSo, the company has 60 compact cars, 40 midsize cars, and 20 full-size cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ compact cars}, 40 \\text{ midsize cars}, 20 \\text{ full-size cars}} \\]"
