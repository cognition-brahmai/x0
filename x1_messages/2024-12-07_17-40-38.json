        "content": "To design a simple command-line calculator in Java that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers entered by the user, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Java environment:** Ensure that you have Java installed on your computer. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) if you don't have it already.\n\n2. **Create a new Java class:** Open your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor to create a new Java file. Name it something like `SimpleCalculator.java`.\n\n3. **Import necessary packages:** You will need to import `java.util.Scanner` to read input from the user.\n\n4. **Write the code for the calculator:**\n   - Create a class and the main method.\n   - Use `Scanner` to read user input.\n   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers and the operation they want to perform.\n   - Perform the calculation based on the operation selected.\n   - Handle division by zero to avoid runtime errors.\n\nHere is a sample code that accomplishes this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Simple Calculator\");\n        System.out.println(\"Supported operations: +, -, *, /\");\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter first number: \");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter second number: \");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter operation (+, -, *, /): \");\n        String operator = scanner.next();\n\n        double result;\n        switch (operator) {\n            case \"+\":\n                result = num1 + num2;\n                break;\n            case \"-\":\n                result = num1 - num2;\n                break;\n            case \"*\":\n                result = num1 * num2;\n                break;\n            case \"/\":\n                if (num2 != 0) {\n                    result = num1 / num2;\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n                    return;\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid operator!\");\n                return;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Scanner:** The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.\n2. **Reading Inputs:** The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and the operation they wish to perform.\n3. **Performing Operations:** Using a `switch` statement, the program performs the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the operator entered by the user.\n4. **Handling Division by Zero:** If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program displays an error message and terminates.\n5. **Displaying Result:** The result of the operation is displayed to the user.\n\n### How to Run:\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `SimpleCalculator.java`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory containing the `SimpleCalculator.java` file.\n4. Compile the Java file by running:\n   ```sh\n   javac SimpleCalculator.java\n   ```\n5. Run the compiled program:\n   ```sh\n   java SimpleCalculator\n   ```\n6. Follow the prompts to enter the numbers and the operation.\n\nThis simple calculator can handle basic arithmetic operations and provides basic error handling for invalid operations and division by zero."
