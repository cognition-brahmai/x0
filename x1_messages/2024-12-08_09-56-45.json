Amelia Earhart was actually an American aviator, not British, and she is best known for being the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, not sail. This historic flight took place on May 20-21, 1932, not 1922. In 1937, she disappeared during an attempt to fly around the world with her navigator, Fred Noonan. Their fate remains a mystery.\n\nSo, to answer your question: Amelia Earhart is known for being the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, which she accomplished in 1932.\n\n**References:**\n\n- [Amelia Earhart](https://www.ameliaearhart.com/)"
