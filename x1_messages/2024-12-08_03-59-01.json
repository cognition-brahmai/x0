        "content": "So I have this problem here: the population of a city increases by 5% every year, and the current population is 100,000. I need to find out what the population will be after three years, and I'm supposed to use the compound interest formula to solve it. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the compound interest formula is. I remember that compound interest is when interest is added to the principal amount at the end of each period, and then the next period's interest is calculated on the new total. The formula for compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this population problem, the population is increasing by 5% every year, which seems similar to compound interest where the population grows by a certain percentage each year.\n\nSo, let's map the variables:\n\n- \\( P \\) would be the initial population, which is 100,000.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate, which is 5%, or 0.05 in decimal form.\n\n- Since the population increases once per year, \\( n \\) should be 1.\n\n- \\( t \\) is 3 years.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{1}\\right)^{1 \\times 3} \\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\left(1 + 0.05\\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\left(1.05\\right)^3 \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 1.05 \\) raised to the power of 3.\n\n\\[ 1.05^3 = 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\]\n\nFirst, \\( 1.05 \\times 1.05 = 1.1025 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 1.1025 \\times 1.05 = 1.157625 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\times 1.157625 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 115,762.5 \\]\n\nSince population can't be a fraction, I'll round it to the nearest whole number, which is 115,763.\n\nWait a minute, but populations are typically rounded to whole numbers, so maybe I should avoid rounding inside the calculations and keep more decimal places.\n\nLet me recalculate \\( 1.05^3 \\) more precisely.\n\n\\[ 1.05^3 = 1.157625 \\]\n\nMultiplying by 100,000:\n\n\\[ 100,000 \\times 1.157625 = 115,762.5 \\]\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest whole number gives 115,763.\n\nBut, to ensure accuracy, maybe I can use a different approach, like calculating the population year by year.\n\nStarting with 100,000.\n\nAfter the first year:\n\n\\[ 100,000 + 0.05 \\times 100,000 = 100,000 \\times 1.05 = 105,000 \\]\n\nAfter the second year:\n\n\\[ 105,000 + 0.05 \\times 105,000 = 105,000 \\times 1.05 = 110,250 \\]\n\nAfter the third year:\n\n\\[ 110,250 + 0.05 \\times 110,250 = 110,250 \\times 1.05 = 115,762.5 \\]\n\nAgain, rounding to 115,763.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation using the compound interest formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest with different compounding periods to see if it affects the result, but since it's compounded annually, \\( n = 1 \\), so it should stay the same.\n\nJust to double-check, if the population increases by 5% each year, compounded annually, the formula should be appropriate.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for exponential growth:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 e^{rt} \\]\n\nBut in this case, since it's compounded annually, the first method is more suitable.\n\nWait, no. The exponential growth formula is for continuous compounding, which isn't the case here. The problem specifies annual increases, so the compound interest formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the population after three years will be approximately 115,763.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the population, like migration or other changes, but the problem doesn't mention any such factors, so I'll assume that the only change is due to the 5% annual increase.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the interest rate is indeed 5% per year, and it's compounded annually, which it appears to be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula for population growth, but since the problem specifies to use the compound interest formula, I'll stick with that.\n\nLet me also consider if the 5% increase is applied simply each year or compounded. If it's compounded, then the compound interest formula is appropriate.\n\nTo illustrate the difference:\n\n- Simple interest would be: \\( A = P(1 + rt) \\)\n\n- Compound interest: \\( A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt} \\)\n\nIn this case, simple interest would give:\n\n\\[ A = 100,000(1 + 0.05 \\times 3) = 100,000 \\times 1.15 = 115,000 \\]\n\nWhich is different from the compound interest result of 115,763.\n\nSince the problem specifies to use the compound interest formula, and because population growth is typically compounded, the higher value should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the population after three years will be approximately 115,763.\n\nI think that's the answer, but to be absolutely sure, let's try calculating it one more time.\n\nStarting with 100,000.\n\nAfter year 1: 100,000 * 1.05 = 105,000\n\nAfter year 2: 105,000 * 1.05 = 110,250\n\nAfter year 3: 110,250 * 1.05 = 115,762.5\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number: 115,763\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\times (1.05)^3 = 100,000 \\times 1.157625 = 115,762.5 \\]\n\nAgain, 115,763.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{115763} \\]"
