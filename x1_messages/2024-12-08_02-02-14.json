        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a hospital trying to improve its ER wait times and patient satisfaction. Let's see what we've got.\n\nFirst, the ER sees 300 patients per day, and 40% of those come during the peak time between 6 PM and midnight. So, let's calculate how many patients that is.\n\n40% of 300 is 0.4 times 300, which is 120 patients during peak hours.\n\nNow, the hospital has 20 ER beds, 15 doctors, and 30 nurses during peak hours. They want to reduce the average wait times by 25%. To figure out how many additional doctors and nurses they need to hire, we need to understand the current workload and how adding more staff could affect wait times.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the current wait times. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide the current average wait time, so we might need to make some assumptions here.\n\nLet's assume the current average wait time is W minutes. They want to reduce this by 25%, so the target wait time is 0.75W.\n\nBut without knowing W, it's a bit tricky. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps we can look at the patient-to-staff ratio and see how adding more staff could reduce wait times.\n\nLet's see: during peak hours, there are 15 doctors and 30 nurses for 120 patients.\n\nSo, the doctor-to-patient ratio is 15 doctors to 120 patients, which is 1 doctor for every 8 patients.\n\nSimilarly, the nurse-to-patient ratio is 30 nurses to 120 patients, which is 1 nurse for every 4 patients.\n\nNow, to reduce wait times, we need to see how much faster patients can be attended to if we add more staff.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague. Maybe we need to consider the service rate.\n\nIn queueing theory, wait times are influenced by the arrival rate and the service rate.\n\nThe arrival rate during peak hours is 120 patients over 6 hours (from 6 PM to midnight), so that's 20 patients per hour.\n\nNow, with 15 doctors, if each doctor can see, say, D patients per hour, then the total service rate is 15D patients per hour.\n\nSimilarly, nurses are assisting, but let's assume that the bottleneck is the doctors, as they are fewer in number.\n\nSo, if the service rate is 15D patients per hour and the arrival rate is 20 patients per hour, then if 15D is less than 20, there will be a queue buildup.\n\nTo reduce wait times, we need to increase the service rate so that it's higher than the arrival rate, and ideally, as high as possible to minimize waiting times.\n\nThe problem is that we don't know the current service rate per doctor per hour.\n\nMaybe we need to make an assumption here.\n\nLet's assume that each doctor can see 2 patients per hour. So, the total service rate is 15 doctors times 2 patients per hour, which is 30 patients per hour.\n\nBut the arrival rate is 20 patients per hour. So, service rate is higher than arrival rate, which should mean that the queue doesn't build up, and wait times should be manageable.\n\nBut perhaps this assumption is incorrect, and in reality, doctors take more time per patient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some patients require more time than others.\n\nWait, perhaps not all patients are equally time-consuming.\n\nMaybe we need to consider the mix of patient severity.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify anything about that, so perhaps we should proceed with the average figures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 20 patients per hour arrival rate is being served by 15 doctors, but the wait times are still high, which suggests that the service rate per doctor might be lower than assumed.\n\nLet's try to think differently.\n\nSuppose the current average wait time is W minutes, and they want to reduce it by 25%, so the target is 0.75W.\n\nTo achieve this, they need to increase the service rate.\n\nIn queueing theory, wait time is inversely proportional to the service rate.\n\nSpecifically, in an M/M/1 queue, wait time is proportional to 1/(mu - lambda), where mu is the service rate and lambda is the arrival rate.\n\nSo, if we increase the service rate mu, wait time decreases.\n\nSimilarly, in an M/M/c queue with c servers, wait time depends on the total service rate.\n\nSo, by adding more doctors (increasing c), the total service rate increases, and wait times decrease.\n\nTo quantify this, we can use the formula for the average wait time in an M/M/c queue:\n\nW = (lambda / (c * mu - lambda)) * (1 / mu)\n\nWhere:\n\n- lambda is the arrival rate\n\n- c is the number of servers (doctors)\n\n- mu is the service rate per doctor\n\nBut again, we don't have values for mu or lambda in this context.\n\nWait, we do have lambda: 20 patients per hour.\n\nWe need to find mu, the service rate per doctor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the current wait time and the target wait time in terms of the number of doctors.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Current number of doctors: c = 15\n\n- Arrival rate: lambda = 20 patients per hour\n\n- Service rate per doctor: mu (patients per hour)\n\nCurrent wait time: W = (lambda / (c * mu - lambda)) * (1 / mu)\n\nTarget wait time: 0.75W = (lambda / (c' * mu - lambda)) * (1 / mu)\n\nWhere c' is the new number of doctors.\n\nWe need to find c' such that 0.75W is achieved.\n\nBut this seems complicated without knowing mu.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume that wait time is inversely proportional to the number of doctors.\n\nSo, if we increase the number of doctors by a certain factor, wait time decreases by the same factor.\n\nBut this is a simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look at the ratio of doctors to patients.\n\nCurrently, 15 doctors for 120 patients, which is 1 doctor per 8 patients.\n\nIf we reduce wait times by 25%, perhaps we need to increase the number of doctors such that the ratio changes accordingly.\n\nBut this is still unclear.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet's think about the total patient load during peak hours.\n\n120 patients over 6 hours.\n\nSo, on average, 20 patients per hour.\n\nWith 15 doctors, that's approximately 1.33 patients per doctor per hour.\n\nBut without knowing how many patients each doctor can handle per hour, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider the utilization factor.\n\nIn queueing theory, the utilization factor rho is lambda / (c * mu).\n\nFor the system to be stable, rho needs to be less than 1.\n\nSo, rho = lambda / (c * mu) < 1.\n\nIn our case, lambda = 20 patients per hour, c = 15 doctors, mu = ?\n\nSo, rho = 20 / (15 * mu).\n\nTo have a stable system, 20 / (15 * mu) < 1, which implies mu > 20 / 15 = 1.333 patients per hour per doctor.\n\nSo, each doctor needs to serve more than 1.333 patients per hour for the system to be stable.\n\nBut again, without knowing mu, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe I need to make an assumption about mu.\n\nLet's assume that each doctor can serve 2 patients per hour.\n\nThen, total service rate is 15 doctors * 2 patients per hour = 30 patients per hour.\n\nArrival rate is 20 patients per hour.\n\nSo, rho = 20 / 30 = 0.6667.\n\nWhich is less than 1, so the system is stable.\n\nNow, to reduce wait times by 25%, we need to decrease W by 25%.\n\nBut in the M/M/c model, wait time W is given by:\n\nW = (lambda / (c * mu - lambda)) * (1 / mu)\n\nSo, W = (20 / (15 * 2 - 20)) * (1 / 2) = (20 / (30 - 20)) * 0.5 = (20 / 10) * 0.5 = 2 * 0.5 = 1 hour.\n\nSo, current wait time is 1 hour.\n\nTarget wait time is 0.75 * 1 = 0.75 hours, or 45 minutes.\n\nBut does this make sense? A current wait time of 1 hour seems high, given the service rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nActually, in the M/M/c model, the average waiting time in the queue W_q is given by:\n\nW_q = (lambda / (c * mu - lambda)) * (1 / (c * mu))\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the formula for W_q in M/M/c is:\n\nW_q = ( (lambda / ( c * mu ))^c * (lambda / (mu * (c - lambda / mu))) ) / (c! * (1 - (lambda / (c * mu)))^2 )\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that wait time is inversely proportional to the number of doctors.\n\nSo, if we increase the number of doctors by a certain factor, wait time decreases by that factor.\n\nSo, to reduce wait time by 25%, we need to increase the number of doctors by 25%.\n\nSo, 15 doctors * 1.25 = 18.75, say 19 doctors.\n\nBut this seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to double the number of doctors to halve the wait time.\n\nBut again, this might not be accurate.\n\nMaybe I should look up the specific formula for M/M/c queue waiting time.\n\nUpon looking it up, the formula for the average waiting time in the queue W_q for an M/M/c queue is:\n\nW_q = (lambda / mu)^c * (lambda / (mu * (c - lambda / mu))) / (c! * (c * mu - lambda)^2 ) )\n\nBut this seems too complex to work with without specific values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in an M/M/c queue, the waiting time is inversely proportional to the difference between the total service rate and the arrival rate.\n\nSo, W_q is proportional to 1 / (c * mu - lambda)\n\nSo, to reduce W_q by 25%, we need to increase c * mu such that c * mu - lambda increases by a factor of 1 / 0.75 = 4/3.\n\nSo, if current c * mu - lambda = 10 (from earlier: 30 - 20 = 10), then to reduce W_q by 25%, we need c' * mu - lambda = 10 * 4/3 = 40/3 \u2248 13.33.\n\nSo, c' * mu = 13.33 + 20 = 33.33.\n\nGiven that mu = 2 patients per hour per doctor, then c' = 33.33 / 2 = 16.665, say 17 doctors.\n\nSo, from 15 to 17 doctors, that's 2 additional doctors.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that increasing doctors by 25% would require 15 * 1.25 = 18.75, which is 19 doctors.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationship isn't linear.\n\nMaybe I need to recast this.\n\nLet\u2019s see, current c * mu = 15 * 2 = 30.\n\nTarget c' * mu = 33.33.\n\nSo, additional doctors needed = 33.33 / 2 - 15 = 16.665 - 15 = 1.665, say 2 doctors.\n\nSimilarly, for nurses, but the problem seems to focus more on doctors since they might be the bottleneck.\n\nBut perhaps nurses also need to be considered.\n\nAssuming that nurses assist doctors, perhaps the nurse-to-doctor ratio should be maintained.\n\nCurrently, it's 30 nurses for 15 doctors, which is 2 nurses per doctor.\n\nSo, if we add 2 doctors, we might need to add 4 nurses to maintain the same ratio.\n\nTherefore, total additional staff needed would be 2 doctors and 4 nurses.\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nWith 17 doctors and 34 nurses, the doctor-to-patient ratio during peak hours would be 17 doctors for 120 patients, which is about 1 doctor per 7 patients, and 34 nurses for 120 patients, which is about 1 nurse per 3.5 patients.\n\nComparing to before: 1 doctor per 8 patients and 1 nurse per 4 patients.\n\nSo, slightly improved ratios.\n\nBut would this reduce wait times by 25%?\n\nWell, based on the earlier calculation, yes, because c * mu increases from 30 to 34, which is more than the required 33.33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more precisely, with c' = 17 doctors, c' * mu = 34, c' * mu - lambda = 34 - 20 = 14, which is greater than the required 13.33.\n\nSo, this should achieve the target wait time.\n\nTherefore, the hospital should hire 2 additional doctors and 4 additional nurses during peak hours to reduce average wait times by 25%.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way to confirm this?\n\nMaybe we can calculate the wait times before and after.\n\nBefore:\n\nc = 15, mu = 2, lambda = 20.\n\nc * mu = 30.\n\nc * mu - lambda = 10.\n\nW_q = (lambda / (c * mu - lambda)) * (1 / mu) = (20 / 10) * 0.5 = 2 * 0.5 = 1 hour.\n\nAfter:\n\nc' = 17, mu = 2, lambda = 20.\n\nc' * mu = 34.\n\nc' * mu - lambda = 14.\n\nW_q = (20 / 14) * 0.5 \u2248 1.4286 * 0.5 \u2248 0.7143 hours, which is about 42.86 minutes.\n\nOriginal wait time was 1 hour, so 42.86 minutes is a reduction of about 30%, which is more than the target 25%.\n\nSo, hiring 2 additional doctors and 4 additional nurses would achieve the target wait time reduction of 25%.\n\nAlternatively, if we hire only 1 additional doctor and 2 additional nurses:\n\nc' = 16, mu = 2, lambda = 20.\n\nc' * mu = 32.\n\nc' * mu - lambda = 12.\n\nW_q = (20 / 12) * 0.5 \u2248 1.6667 * 0.5 \u2248 0.8333 hours, which is 50 minutes.\n\nReduction from 60 minutes to 50 minutes is a 16.67% reduction, which is less than the target 25%.\n\nTherefore, hiring only 1 additional doctor and 2 additional nurses wouldn't suffice.\n\nHence, the hospital should hire 2 additional doctors and 4 additional nurses during peak hours to achieve at least a 25% reduction in average wait times.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ additional doctors and 4 additional nurses}} \\]\n"
