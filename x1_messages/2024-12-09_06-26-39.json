Each step in your plan should correspond with an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be either the user's question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\nWebSearch[input]: This tool allows the user to search for information on the internet using a general-purpose search engine. It is useful for finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from a website URL. The input is a single URL and the output is the plain text content of the site.\nLinkCollector[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text. The output is a newline-separated list of links.\nInfoQA[input]: A question-answering model that can provide answers based on a passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., \"What is the population of New York City, given :evidence1:?\"\n\nThe input to each function should be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., InfoQA[What is the capital of France, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure that there is only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action to take based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the most popular tourist attraction in Paris and what is its history?"
