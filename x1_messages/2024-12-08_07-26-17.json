        "content": "So the football team won 75% of its games last season, and they played a total of 32 games. I need to find out how many games they won. Let's see, percentages are parts of 100, right? So 75% means 75 out of 100. But here, instead of 100 games, they played 32 games. So, I need to find 75% of 32.\n\nFirst, I should recall how to calculate a percentage of a number. I think the formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of wins} = \\text{percentage} \\times \\text{total games}\n\\]\n\nBut percentages are usually in decimal form in calculations. So, 75% as a decimal is 0.75. So, I can rewrite the formula as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of wins} = 0.75 \\times 32\n\\]\n\nNow, I just need to do the multiplication. Let's see:\n\n0.75 times 30 is 22.5, and 0.75 times 2 is 1.5. So, 22.5 plus 1.5 is 24. Wait, is that correct? Maybe I should do it differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 75% as three-quarters (since 75 divided by 100 is 0.75, and 0.75 is the same as 3/4). So, three-quarters of 32 should be the number of wins.\n\nTo find three-quarters of 32, I can first find one-quarter of 32 and then multiply by three.\n\nOne-quarter of 32 is 32 divided by 4, which is 8. Then, three-quarters would be 8 times 3, which is 24.\n\nSo, the team won 24 games.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I tried multiplying 0.75 by 32 and got the same result. So, both methods lead to 24.\n\nBut to be sure, let me check again. Using the decimal method:\n\n0.75 \u00d7 32:\n\n0.75 \u00d7 30 = 22.5\n\n0.75 \u00d7 2 = 1.5\n\nAdding them up: 22.5 + 1.5 = 24.\n\nYes, that matches the fraction method.\n\nAlternatively, I could have converted the percentage to a fraction before multiplying. So, 75% is 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4. Then, 3/4 times 32 is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 32 = \\frac{3 \\times 32}{4} = \\frac{96}{4} = 24\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 24 is the correct number of games they won.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I let x be the number of games won. Then, according to the problem, x is 75% of 32.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.75 \\times 32\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to x = 24.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion:\n\n75% is to 100% as x is to 32.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{75}{100} = \\frac{x}{32}\n\\]\n\nThen, solving for x:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{75 \\times 32}{100}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n75 times 32 is 2400, and 2400 divided by 100 is 24.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think no matter which method I use, I end up with 24 games won.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other perspective I should look at this from.\n\nIs there a chance that the team played some games to a draw, and that affects the number of wins? The problem says they won 75% of its games, so I assume the rest were either losses or draws, but since it's only asking for wins, and doesn't provide information about draws, I can assume that the wins are straightforward.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that they played 32 games, and won 75% of them, so no need to consider any additional games.\n\nSo, I think 24 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, I can perform a sanity check.\n\nIf the team won 75% of 32 games, then the number of wins should be less than 32, which 24 is. Also, 50% of 32 is 16, and 75% should be more than that, which 24 is. So, it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the percentage to verify.\n\nIf they won 24 out of 32 games, what percentage is that?\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{24}{32} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches the given information.\n\nTherefore, the team won 24 games.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
