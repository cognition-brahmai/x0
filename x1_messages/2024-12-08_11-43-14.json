        "content": "Let's see. If a car is going 60 miles per hour, and we want to know how far it can go in 30 minutes, we need to figure out what part of an hour 30 minutes is, right? Because the speed is given per hour.\n\nFirst, I know that 60 minutes make an hour, so 30 minutes is half of that. So, 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.\n\nNow, if the car travels 60 miles in one hour, in 0.5 hours it would travel half of that distance. So, 60 miles times 0.5 is 30 miles.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's a formula for this. I think distance equals speed multiplied by time, or d = s * t.\n\nSo, in this case, speed s is 60 miles per hour, and time t is 0.5 hours.\n\nPlugging that in: d = 60 * 0.5 = 30 miles.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But maybe I should consider units to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nSpeed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so when I multiply them, the units are miles, which makes sense for distance.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of proportions, if 60 miles correspond to 1 hour, then x miles correspond to 0.5 hours.\n\nSo, x = (60 miles * 0.5 hours) / 1 hour = 30 miles.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nWait, but what if the time was given in minutes instead of hours? Could I handle that?\n\nWell, if time is 30 minutes, and I know that 60 minutes are in an hour, then 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert the speed into miles per minute.\n\nIf 60 miles are traveled in 60 minutes, then in one minute, the car travels 1 mile.\n\nSo, in 30 minutes, it would travel 30 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 30 miles.\n\nMaybe I can use the concept of rates. The car's speed is a rate of 60 miles per hour.\n\nSo, rate times time gives distance.\n\nRate * time = distance.\n\n60 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 30 miles.\n\nConsistent again.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The car can travel 30 miles in 30 minutes at a speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
