        "content": "So there are 10 red balls and 6 blue balls in the box, making a total of 10 + 6 = 16 balls. The probability of picking a red ball would be the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, so that's 10 divided by 16. Simplifying that fraction, it's 5/8. So the probability is 5/8.\n"
