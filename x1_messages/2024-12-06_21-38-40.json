        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about planning a new sports complex. There are three main parts: a stadium, an indoor arena, and multiple outdoor fields. The total budget for construction is $150 million. The budget is allocated as follows: 40% for the stadium, 30% for the indoor arena, and the remaining 30% for the outdoor fields. I need to calculate the individual budgets for each facility and then estimate the total seating capacity based on the average cost per seat for each area.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much money is allocated to each facility.\n\nStarting with the stadium:\n\nThe stadium gets 40% of the total budget.\n\nSo, stadium budget = 40% of $150 million.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 150,000,000 by 0.40.\n\n150,000,000 * 0.40 = 60,000,000.\n\nSo, the stadium budget is $60 million.\n\nNext, the indoor arena gets 30% of the total budget.\n\nIndoor arena budget = 30% of $150 million.\n\n150,000,000 * 0.30 = 45,000,000.\n\nSo, the indoor arena budget is $45 million.\n\nFinally, the outdoor fields also get 30% of the total budget.\n\nOutdoor fields budget = 30% of $150 million.\n\nAgain, that's 150,000,000 * 0.30 = 45,000,000.\n\nSo, the outdoor fields budget is also $45 million.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the total seating capacity for each facility based on the average cost per seat.\n\nFor the stadium:\n\nAverage cost per seat is $500.\n\nSo, the number of seats for the stadium can be calculated by dividing the stadium budget by the cost per seat.\n\nStadium seats = stadium budget / cost per seat.\n\n60,000,000 / 500 = 120,000 seats.\n\nSimilarly, for the indoor arena:\n\nAverage cost per seat is $400.\n\nIndoor arena seats = indoor arena budget / cost per seat.\n\n45,000,000 / 400 = 112,500 seats.\n\nAnd for the outdoor fields:\n\nAverage cost per seat is $200.\n\nOutdoor fields seats = outdoor fields budget / cost per seat.\n\n45,000,000 / 200 = 225,000 seats.\n\nNow, to find the total seating capacity, I need to add up the seats from all three facilities.\n\nTotal seats = stadium seats + indoor arena seats + outdoor fields seats.\n\n120,000 + 112,500 + 225,000 = 457,500 seats.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of seats. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the budgets:\n\nStadium: 40% of 150 million is indeed 60 million.\n\nIndoor arena: 30% of 150 million is 45 million.\n\nOutdoor fields: 30% of 150 million is 45 million.\n\nThat part seems correct.\n\nNow, for the seating capacity:\n\nStadium: 60,000,000 / 500 = 120,000 seats. That seems right.\n\nIndoor arena: 45,000,000 / 400 = 112,500 seats. That also seems correct.\n\nOutdoor fields: 45,000,000 / 200 = 225,000 seats. That seems fine too.\n\nAdding them up: 120,000 + 112,500 + 225,000.\n\nLet's add 120,000 and 112,500 first: that's 232,500.\n\nThen add 225,000: 232,500 + 225,000 = 457,500 seats.\n\nHmm, 457,500 seats in total seems like a very large number. Maybe I should consider whether all the budget is being used for seating.\n\nWait a second, perhaps not all of the budget for each facility is allocated to seating. There might be other costs involved in constructing the facilities, and the seating costs are just a part of it.\n\nThe problem says \"average cost per seat is $500 for the stadium, $400 for the indoor arena, and $200 for the outdoor fields.\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify that the entire budget is being used for seats. Maybe these costs include not just the seats but also other infrastructure related to seating areas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the seating costs are the only consideration, and the entire budget is allocated to seating.\n\nGiven the information provided, I've assumed that the entire budget for each facility is allocated to seating, based on the average cost per seat.\n\nBut perhaps it's more realistic to assume that only a portion of the budget is allocated to seating, and the rest goes to other construction costs.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify any other costs, I think I should proceed with the assumption that the entire budget for each facility is allocated to seating, based on the given average costs per seat.\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculations stand:\n\nStadium: 120,000 seats\n\nIndoor arena: 112,500 seats\n\nOutdoor fields: 225,000 seats\n\nTotal seating capacity: 457,500 seats\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the outdoor fields would have as many seats as my calculation suggests.\n\nOutdoor fields often have lower seating requirements compared to stadiums and indoor arenas, but according to the numbers, with a budget of $45 million and a cost per seat of $200, 225,000 seats seem plausible, but it might be on the higher side.\n\nPerhaps some research into typical seating capacities for sports complexes could help validate this estimate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost per seat for outdoor fields is lower because they might have more basic seating arrangements, such as bleachers or grassy slopes, which are less expensive than seated stadiums.\n\nNevertheless, based on the information provided, my calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Stadium budget: $60 million\n\n- Indoor arena budget: $45 million\n\n- Outdoor fields budget: $45 million\n\nSeating capacities:\n\n- Stadium: 120,000 seats\n\n- Indoor arena: 112,500 seats\n\n- Outdoor fields: 225,000 seats\n\nTotal seating capacity: 457,500 seats\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{457500} \\]"
