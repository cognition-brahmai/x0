        "content": "To determine how much fencing is needed for a rectangular garden that measures 20 feet by 15 feet, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, you will need 70 feet of fencing to enclose the entire garden."
