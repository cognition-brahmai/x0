He's one of the most renowned American writers, known for his straightforward prose and what's often called the \"Iceberg Theory\" in literature, where most of the meaning lies beneath the surface. \"The Old Man and the Sea\" is a classic that showcases his style, focusing on themes of perseverance and the struggle against nature. \"A Farewell to Arms\" is another masterpiece, a novel set during World War I that delves into love and loss amidst the chaos of war. Hemingway's influence on modern literature is immeasurable, and his Nobel Prize in 1954 was a well-deserved recognition of his contributions."
