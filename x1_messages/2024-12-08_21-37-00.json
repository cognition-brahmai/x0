        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 birds sitting on a fence. Half of them fly away. So, half of 12 is 6. That means 6 birds fly away, right? So, 12 minus 6 is 6 birds left on the fence. Then, 4 more birds join them. So, 6 plus 4 is 10. Therefore, there are now 10 birds on the fence.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Starting with 12 birds, half fly away: 12 divided by 2 is 6, so 6 fly away, leaving 6 on the fence. Then, 4 more join them, so 6 plus 4 equals 10. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should think about it differently to confirm. Suppose I consider the birds that fly away first. Half of them fly away, so that's 6 birds flying away. Then, 4 more birds come to join the remaining 6. So, 6 plus 4 is indeed 10.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total change in the number of birds. Initially, there are 12. Half fly away, which is a decrease of 6, so 12 - 6 = 6. Then, 4 more join, which is an increase of 4, so 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the net change. Starting with 12, half fly away and then 4 join. So, the net change is -6 (from flying away) plus 4 (from joining), which is a net change of -2. So, 12 - 2 = 10. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if half fly away and then 4 join, it's not just a net change of -2.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the net change calculation. Let's re-examine that. If half fly away, that's -6, and then 4 join, which is +4, so the net change is -6 + 4 = -2. But 12 - 2 = 10, which matches the previous calculation. So, yes, 10 birds are now on the fence.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think of it with smaller numbers to see if that helps.\n\nSuppose there are 4 birds on the fence. Half fly away: that's 2 fly away, leaving 2. Then, 1 more joins them, so 2 + 1 = 3. Now, using the net change method: starting with 4, net change is -2 (half fly away) plus 1 (joining), which is -1. So, 4 - 1 = 3, which matches the earlier result.\n\nApplying the same logic to the original problem: starting with 12, net change is -6 (half fly away) plus 4 (joining), which is -2. So, 12 - 2 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, another way: half fly away, so 6 fly away, leaving 6. Then, 4 join, making it 10.\n\nOr, thinking in fractions: half fly away, so remaining is 1/2, then 4 join, so total is (1/2 * 12) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nI think no matter how I approach it, the answer comes out to be 10 birds on the fence.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there any ambiguity in the wording? \"Half of them fly away, and then 4 more join the remaining birds.\"\n\nIt seems clear: starting with 12, half (6) fly away, leaving 6, and then 4 more join, making it 10.\n\nUnless perhaps there's some trick or additional information I'm missing, but based on the given information, 10 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking it, but it's always good to verify calculations in different ways to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, the final answer is 10 birds on the fence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
