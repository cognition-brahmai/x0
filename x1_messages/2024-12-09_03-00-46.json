        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a player who's taking shots at a target. For each hit, they score 2 points, and for each miss, they lose 1 point. The player takes a total of 50 shots and ends up with a score of 60. We need to figure out how many targets they hit.\n\nFirst, I think I should define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( h \\) be the number of targets hit.\n\n- Let \\( m \\) be the number of targets missed.\n\nWe know that the total number of shots is 50, so:\n\n\\[ h + m = 50 \\]\n\nNext, for scoring:\n\n- Each hit gives 2 points, so hits contribute \\( 2h \\) points.\n\n- Each miss deducts 1 point, so misses deduct \\( m \\) points.\n\nThe total score is 60, so:\n\n\\[ 2h - m = 60 \\]\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( h + m = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2h - m = 60 \\)\n\nI can solve these equations simultaneously. One way to do this is to add the two equations together to eliminate \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ (h + m) + (2h - m) = 50 + 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 3h = 110 \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{110}{3} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because \\( h \\) should be a whole number since you can't hit a fraction of a target. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me try that again. Adding the two equations:\n\n\\[ (h + m) + (2h - m) = 50 + 60 \\]\n\n\\[ h + m + 2h - m = 110 \\]\n\n\\[ 3h = 110 \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{110}{3} \\]\n\nStill getting the same result, which is approximately 36.666. But hits have to be a whole number. Maybe there's a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me rethink this. Perhaps I should consider the points differently. Let's think about the minimum and maximum possible scores.\n\nIf the player misses all 50 shots, they lose 1 point each time, so their score would be:\n\n\\[ -50 \\]\n\nIf they hit all 50 shots, they gain 2 points each time, so their score would be:\n\n\\[ 100 \\]\n\nSince their actual score is 60, which is between -50 and 100, it makes sense.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose all shots were hits, which would give 100 points. But the player only has 60 points, so they are 40 points short of 100.\n\nEach miss not only misses the 2 points from a hit but also deducts 1 point, so each miss affects the score by \\( -2 \\) (for not hitting) minus \\( -1 \\) (for missing), which is a total deduction of 3 points from the maximum possible score.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right way to look at it. Let's try to think differently.\n\nIf the player hits \\( h \\) targets and misses \\( m \\) targets, with \\( h + m = 50 \\), and \\( 2h - m = 60 \\).\n\nI can express \\( m \\) in terms of \\( h \\) from the first equation:\n\n\\[ m = 50 - h \\]\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 2h - (50 - h) = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 2h - 50 + h = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 3h - 50 = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 3h = 110 \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{110}{3} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. This suggests that perhaps there's no solution, or maybe the problem is misstated. But that can't be right because the problem is posed as having a solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of hits and misses aren't both integers. But that doesn't make sense in this context, as you can't have a fraction of a shot.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Let's check the equations again.\n\nTotal shots:\n\n\\[ h + m = 50 \\]\n\nTotal score:\n\n\\[ 2h - m = 60 \\]\n\nThese seem correct.\n\nLet me try solving for \\( m \\) instead.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[ m = 50 - h \\]\n\nPlug into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 2h - (50 - h) = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 2h - 50 + h = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 3h = 110 \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{110}{3} \\]\n\nThis is consistent, but it's not an integer. Maybe the problem has no solution, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the player doesn't take all 50 shots, but that contradicts the statement that they take 50 shots.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider the total points gained from hits and lost from misses.\n\nEach hit gives +2, each miss gives -1.\n\nTotal shots: 50.\n\nTotal score: 60.\n\nSo, if all shots were hits, score would be 100.\n\nEach miss reduces the score by 3 points (loses 1 for missing and doesn't gain 2 for hitting, so total reduction of 3).\n\nDifference between perfect score and actual score: 100 - 60 = 40.\n\nEach miss accounts for a reduction of 3 points.\n\nSo, number of misses: \\( \\frac{40}{3} \\), which is approximately 13.333.\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that there is no integer solution, which implies that either the problem is misstated or there is no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the player can have partial misses or hits, but that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the scoring.\n\nWait, perhaps the player doesn't lose a point for missing; maybe they just don't gain points.\n\nBut the problem specifically says they lose 1 point for missing.\n\nSo, in that case, the equations I set up should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of shots is not 50, or the total score is not 60, but without changing those, I can't resolve the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the player had some shots that were neither hits nor misses, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scoring system allows for other possibilities, but again, the problem seems clear.\n\nGiven that, I think the most likely conclusion is that there is no solution with the given parameters, as the number of hits would need to be a fraction, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that there is no solution to this problem as stated.\n\nHowever, if I were to assume that there might be a typo and adjust the total score to make the numbers work, I could try to find a plausible total score that results in integer values for hits and misses.\n\nFor example, if the total score were 60, and hits are 2 per hit, misses are -1 per miss, total shots 50.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{110}{3} \\approx 36.666 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 50 - h = 50 - 36.666 = 13.333 \\]\n\nNot integers.\n\nIf I assume h = 37, then m = 13.\n\nThen, score would be:\n\n\\[ 2*37 - 13 = 74 - 13 = 61 \\]\n\nClose to 60.\n\nIf h = 36, m = 14.\n\nScore:\n\n\\[ 2*36 - 14 = 72 - 14 = 58 \\]\n\nStill not 60.\n\nSo, 36 hits give 58, 37 hits give 61. 60 is in between, which aligns with the fractional result.\n\nTherefore, with the given parameters, there is no integer solution, meaning the player couldn't have taken exactly 50 shots and ended with exactly 60 points under the scoring system described.\n\nUnless, of course, there's a mistake in my reasoning, which I haven't spotted yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the player can choose to not shoot some of the shots, but the problem says \"takes 50 shots,\" so that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some shots can be partially successful, but again, the problem suggests binary outcomes: hit or miss.\n\nGiven all that, I think the conclusion is that there is no solution with the given parameters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No solution with integer values for hits and misses.}} \\]"
