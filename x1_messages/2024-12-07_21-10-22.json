If it is, I'll do my best to solve it. So, it seems like you're describing something that can turn or change in some way without actually moving physically. Maybe it's about perspective or appearance? I'm going to take a guess: a door knob? No, that doesn't seem right because a door knob does move when you turn it. How about a compass? A compass can turn to point north without the entire object moving, just the needle moves. But that might not be what you're thinking of. Or perhaps it's a more abstract concept, like time? Time can turn or change without physically moving anything. What do you think?"
