        "content": "The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, was built in Rome under the Roman Emperor Vespasian and completed by his son Titus in 80 AD. It was primarily used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators and was an iconic symbol of the Roman Empire's power and engineering prowess."
