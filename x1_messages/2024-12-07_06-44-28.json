        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, we've got an event management company organizing a music festival, and they need to figure out the total cost of setting up different stages, sound systems, and lighting equipment. Then, based on that, they want to know how much they can spend on marketing and artist fees while maintaining a 25% profit margin.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- There are three sizes of stages: small, medium, and large.\n\n- The costs are:\n\n  - Small stage: $10,000\n\n  - Medium stage: $20,000\n\n  - Large stage: $40,000\n\n- Additionally, each stage requires a sound system costing $5,000 and lighting equipment costing $3,000.\n\n- They are setting up 5 small stages, 3 medium stages, and 2 large stages.\n\n- They want to maintain a 25% profit margin.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the total setup cost and then determine how much can be spent on marketing and artist fees while ensuring a 25% profit.\n\nLet's start by calculating the total cost for each type of stage, including the additional sound and lighting costs.\n\nFirst, for the small stages:\n\n- Number of small stages: 5\n\n- Cost per small stage: $10,000\n\n- Sound system per stage: $5,000\n\n- Lighting equipment per stage: $3,000\n\nSo, total cost for one small stage = $10,000 + $5,000 + $3,000 = $18,000\n\nTherefore, for 5 small stages: 5 * $18,000 = $90,000\n\nNext, for the medium stages:\n\n- Number of medium stages: 3\n\n- Cost per medium stage: $20,000\n\n- Sound system per stage: $5,000\n\n- Lighting equipment per stage: $3,000\n\nTotal cost for one medium stage = $20,000 + $5,000 + $3,000 = $28,000\n\nTherefore, for 3 medium stages: 3 * $28,000 = $84,000\n\nNow, for the large stages:\n\n- Number of large stages: 2\n\n- Cost per large stage: $40,000\n\n- Sound system per stage: $5,000\n\n- Lighting equipment per stage: $3,000\n\nTotal cost for one large stage = $40,000 + $5,000 + $3,000 = $48,000\n\nTherefore, for 2 large stages: 2 * $48,000 = $96,000\n\nNow, let's add up all these costs to get the total setup cost:\n\nTotal setup cost = cost of small stages + cost of medium stages + cost of large stages\n\nTotal setup cost = $90,000 + $84,000 + $96,000 = $270,000\n\nSo, the total setup cost is $270,000.\n\nNow, the company wants to maintain a 25% profit margin. That means that the setup cost should be 75% of the total revenue, and the profit will be 25% of the total revenue.\n\nLet's denote the total revenue as R.\n\nThen, according to the profit margin:\n\nSetup cost = R - 0.25R = 0.75R\n\nSo, 0.75R = $270,000\n\nTherefore, R = $270,000 / 0.75 = $360,000\n\nNow, the amount that can be spent on marketing and artist fees would be the total revenue minus the setup cost.\n\nAmount for marketing and artist fees = R - setup cost = $360,000 - $270,000 = $90,000\n\nSo, the company can spend $90,000 on marketing and artist fees while maintaining a 25% profit margin.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that the setup cost is $270,000, and they want a 25% profit on the setup cost. So, profit = 0.25 * setup cost = 0.25 * $270,000 = $67,500\n\nThen, total revenue should be setup cost + profit = $270,000 + $67,500 = $337,500\n\nAnd then, the amount for marketing and artist fees would be total revenue minus setup cost, which is $337,500 - $270,000 = $67,500\n\nHmm, that's different from what I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThere are two ways to interpret a 25% profit margin:\n\n1. The setup cost is 75% of the total revenue, and the profit is 25% of the total revenue.\n\n2. The profit is 25% of the setup cost.\n\nWhich one is the correct interpretation?\n\nI think the first interpretation is more accurate for a profit margin.\n\nA 25% profit margin means that the profit is 25% of the total revenue, not 25% of the setup cost.\n\nTherefore, the first calculation is correct.\n\nSo, total revenue R = setup cost / 0.75 = $270,000 / 0.75 = $360,000\n\nAnd then, the amount for marketing and artist fees is R - setup cost = $360,000 - $270,000 = $90,000\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if it were profit being 25% of the setup cost, then profit = 0.25 * setup cost = $67,500, and total revenue = setup cost + profit = $270,000 + $67,500 = $337,500, and marketing and artist fees would be $67,500.\n\nBut since it's a 25% profit margin, the first interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the company can spend $90,000 on marketing and artist fees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90000} \\]"
