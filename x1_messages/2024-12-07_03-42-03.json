        "content": "So, I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nInitially, there are 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls in the bag. So, the total number of balls at the start is 5 + 3 + 2, which equals 10 balls. The probability of drawing a red ball from this bag is given as 5/10, which makes sense because there are 5 red balls out of 10 total balls.\n\nNow, the problem states that two more red balls are added to the bag. So, I need to find the new probability of drawing a red ball after these additional balls are added.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the new total number of balls in the bag. Originally, there were 10 balls. If I add 2 more red balls, the total number of balls becomes 10 + 2 = 12 balls.\n\nNext, I need to determine the new number of red balls. Initially, there were 5 red balls, and we're adding 2 more, so the new number of red balls is 5 + 2 = 7 red balls.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, the new probability should be 7/12.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me verify the initial probability to make sure I understand correctly. Initially, 5 red balls out of 10 total balls give a probability of 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2. That makes sense.\n\nAfter adding 2 red balls, we have 7 red balls out of 12 total balls. So, the probability is 7/12. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider whether the addition of red balls affects the other balls in any way. The problem says only red balls are added, so the number of blue and green balls remains the same. So, no, only the red balls and the total number of balls change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this in terms of proportions. Initially, red balls make up 5/10 of the bag. After adding 2 red balls, the proportion changes to 7 out of 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I can also calculate the increase in probability. Initially, the probability was 1/2 or 0.5. After adding 2 red balls, the probability becomes 7/12, which is approximately 0.5833. So, there's an increase of about 0.0833 in probability.\n\nBut the question is just asking for the new probability, so 7/12 is the answer.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to test understanding of dependent events or something more complex, but it doesn't seem like it. The problem is straightforward: add two red balls and find the new probability of drawing a red ball.\n\nSo, the final answer is 7/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{12}} \\]"
