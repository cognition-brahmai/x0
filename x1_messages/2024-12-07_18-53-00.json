To create a Golang program that reads a JSON file containing employee information and calculates the average age of employees in each department, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Employee Structure**: Create a struct to represent an employee with fields for name, age, and department.\n\n2. **Read the JSON File**: Read the JSON file and unmarshal its content into a slice of employee structs.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Age per Department**: Iterate through the slice of employees, group them by department, sum their ages, and count the number of employees in each department to calculate the average age.\n\n4. **Output the Results**: Print or return the average ages for each department.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Employee Structure\n\nFirst, we need to define a struct that matches the JSON structure. Assuming the JSON file contains an array of objects, each with \"name\", \"age\", and \"department\" fields.\n\n```go\ntype Employee struct {\n    Name       string `json:\"name\"`\n    Age        int    `json:\"age\"`\n    Department string `json:\"department\"`\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Read the JSON File\n\nWe'll need to read the JSON file and unmarshal its content into a slice of `Employee` structs.\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\nfunc readEmployeesFromFile(filename string) ([]Employee, error) {\n    file, err := os.Open(filename)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    defer file.Close()\n\n    var employees []Employee\n    decoder := json.NewDecoder(file)\n    err = decoder.Decode(&employees)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n\n    return employees, nil\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Average Age per Department\n\nWe'll iterate through the slice of employees, group them by department, sum their ages, and count the number of employees in each department.\n\n```go\nfunc calculateAverageAgePerDepartment(employees []Employee) map[string]float64 {\n    departmentSums := make(map[string]int)\n    departmentCounts := make(map[string]int)\n\n    for _, employee := range employees {\n        department := employee.Department\n        departmentSums[department] += employee.Age\n        departmentCounts[department]++\n    }\n\n    averageAges := make(map[string]float64)\n    for department, sum := range departmentSums {\n        count := departmentCounts[department]\n        averageAges[department] = float64(sum) / float64(count)\n    }\n\n    return averageAges\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Output the Results\n\nFinally, we'll print the average ages for each department.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    employees, err := readEmployeesFromFile(\"employees.json\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Error reading file:\", err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    averageAges := calculateAverageAgePerDepartment(employees)\n\n    for department, avgAge := range averageAges {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Department: %s, Average Age: %.2f\\n\", department, avgAge)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Complete Code\n\nPutting it all together, the complete Golang program would look like this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\ntype Employee struct {\n    Name       string `json:\"name\"`\n    Age        int    `json:\"age\"`\n    Department string `json:\"department\"`\n}\n\nfunc readEmployeesFromFile(filename string) ([]Employee, error) {\n    file, err := os.Open(filename)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    defer file.Close()\n\n    var employees []Employee\n    decoder := json.NewDecoder(file)\n    err = decoder.Decode(&employees)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n\n    return employees, nil\n}\n\nfunc calculateAverageAgePerDepartment(employees []Employee) map[string]float64 {\n    departmentSums := make(map[string]int)\n    departmentCounts := make(map[string]int)\n\n    for _, employee := range employees {\n        department := employee.Department\n        departmentSums[department] += employee.Age\n        departmentCounts[department]++\n    }\n\n    averageAges := make(map[string]float64)\n    for department, sum := range departmentSums {\n        count := departmentCounts[department]\n        averageAges[department] = float64(sum) / float64(count)\n    }\n\n    return averageAges\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    employees, err := readEmployeesFromFile(\"employees.json\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Error reading file:\", err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    averageAges := calculateAverageAgePerDepartment(employees)\n\n    for department, avgAge := range averageAges {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Department: %s, Average Age: %.2f\\n\", department, avgAge)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Employee Structure**: Defines the structure of an employee with name, age, and department fields.\n2. **Reading JSON File**: Opens the specified JSON file, reads its content, and unmarshals it into a slice of `Employee` structs.\n3. **Calculating Average Age**: Groups employees by department, sums their ages, counts the number of employees in each department, and calculates the average age.\n4. **Output Results**: Prints the average age for each department.\n\nMake sure your JSON file (`employees.json`) is formatted correctly and placed in the same directory as your Go program. For example:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"department\": \"HR\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"department\": \"IT\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"department\": \"HR\"},\n    {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"department\": \"IT\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis program will read the JSON file, calculate the average age of employees in each department, and print the results."
