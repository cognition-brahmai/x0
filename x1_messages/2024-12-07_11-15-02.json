        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Implementing a singly linked list in Go is a great way to understand both data structures and the language itself. I'll walk you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a singly linked list is. It's a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node in the sequence. The basic operations we'll implement are:\n\n1. Adding elements:\n   - At the beginning of the list\n   - At the end of the list\n   - At a specific position\n\n2. Removing elements by value\n\n3. Displaying the contents of the list\n\nTo start, we need to define the structure of a node in the linked list. Each node will hold some data and a pointer to the next node.\n\nIn Go, we can define a struct for the node:\n\n```go\ntype Node struct {\n    Data int\n    Next *Node\n}\n```\n\nHere, `Data` holds the value of the node, and `Next` is a pointer to the next node in the list.\n\nNext, we'll create a struct to represent the linked list itself, which will have a pointer to the head (the first node) of the list:\n\n```go\ntype LinkedList struct {\n    Head *Node\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the methods for the linked list.\n\n### 1. Adding elements at the beginning\n\nTo add a new element at the beginning of the list, we need to create a new node and make it point to the current head. Then, update the head to point to this new node.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```go\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) AddAtBeginning(data int) {\n    newNode := &Node{Data: data, Next: ll.Head}\n    ll.Head = newNode\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Adding elements at the end\n\nAdding at the end requires traversing the entire list to find the last node and then appending the new node there.\n\n```go\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) AddAtEnd(data int) {\n    newNode := &Node{Data: data, Next: nil}\n    if ll.Head == nil {\n        ll.Head = newNode\n        return\n    }\n    current := ll.Head\n    for current.Next != nil {\n        current = current.Next\n    }\n    current.Next = newNode\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Adding elements at a specific position\n\nTo add a node at a specific position, we need to traverse the list until we reach the position just before where we want to insert the new node, and then adjust the pointers accordingly.\n\n```go\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) AddAtPosition(data int, position int) {\n    if position == 0 {\n        ll.AddAtBeginning(data)\n        return\n    }\n    newNode := &Node{Data: data, Next: nil}\n    current := ll.Head\n    for i := 0; current != nil && i < position-1; i++ {\n        current = current.Next\n    }\n    if current == nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Position out of range\")\n        return\n    }\n    newNode.Next = current.Next\n    current.Next = newNode\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Removing elements by value\n\nTo remove a node with a specific value, we need to traverse the list, find the node with that value, and adjust the pointers to skip that node.\n\n```go\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) RemoveByValue(data int) {\n    if ll.Head == nil {\n        return\n    }\n    if ll.Head.Data == data {\n        ll.Head = ll.Head.Next\n        return\n    }\n    current := ll.Head\n    for current.Next != nil && current.Next.Data != data {\n        current = current.Next\n    }\n    if current.Next != nil {\n        current.Next = current.Next.Next\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Displaying the contents of the list\n\nTo display the list, we simply traverse it from the head to the end, printing each node's data.\n\n```go\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) Display() {\n    current := ll.Head\n    for current != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"%d -> \", current.Data)\n        current = current.Next\n    }\n    fmt.Println(\"nil\")\n}\n```\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nNow, let's create a main function to test our linked list implementation.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n)\n\ntype Node struct {\n    Data int\n    Next *Node\n}\n\ntype LinkedList struct {\n    Head *Node\n}\n\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) AddAtBeginning(data int) {\n    newNode := &Node{Data: data, Next: ll.Head}\n    ll.Head = newNode\n}\n\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) AddAtEnd(data int) {\n    newNode := &Node{Data: data, Next: nil}\n    if ll.Head == nil {\n        ll.Head = newNode\n        return\n    }\n    current := ll.Head\n    for current.Next != nil {\n        current = current.Next\n    }\n    current.Next = newNode\n}\n\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) AddAtPosition(data int, position int) {\n    if position == 0 {\n        ll.AddAtBeginning(data)\n        return\n    }\n    newNode := &Node{Data: data, Next: nil}\n    current := ll.Head\n    for i := 0; current != nil && i < position-1; i++ {\n        current = current.Next\n    }\n    if current == nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Position out of range\")\n        return\n    }\n    newNode.Next = current.Next\n    current.Next = newNode\n}\n\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) RemoveByValue(data int) {\n    if ll.Head == nil {\n        return\n    }\n    if ll.Head.Data == data {\n        ll.Head = ll.Head.Next\n        return\n    }\n    current := ll.Head\n    for current.Next != nil && current.Next.Data != data {\n        current = current.Next\n    }\n    if current.Next != nil {\n        current.Next = current.Next.Next\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (ll *LinkedList) Display() {\n    current := ll.Head\n    for current != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"%d -> \", current.Data)\n        current = current.Next\n    }\n    fmt.Println(\"nil\")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    ll := &LinkedList{}\n    ll.AddAtBeginning(1)\n    ll.AddAtEnd(2)\n    ll.AddAtPosition(3, 1)\n    ll.Display() // Should print: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> nil\n    ll.RemoveByValue(3)\n    ll.Display() // Should print: 1 -> 2 -> nil\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a singly linked list with the specified operations and tests them in the `main` function.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to implement a singly linked list in Go!
