        "content": "Ah, you're referring to a self-titled album from 1971 by a British rock legend who's often called the \"White Duke.\" Let's see... The White Duke is a nickname for David Bowie, but his self-titled album is actually from 1967, not 1971. Wait, maybe it's someone else.\n\nLet me think differently. In 1971, there were several British rock artists releasing albums. Could it be Elton John? He was big around that time, but I don't recall a self-titled album in 1971. Let's check his discography. Oh, his debut album was \"Elton John\" in 1969, so that doesn't match.\n\nWhat about Rod Stewart? He was active in the early '70s. His self-titled debut was in 1971, and he was known for some hits like \"Maggie May.\" But I'm not sure if he was called the \"White Duke.\" Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's Mick Jagger. He's a British rock legend, and maybe he had a solo album in 1971. But I think his first solo album was \"Mick Jagger\" in 1970, which is close but not exact.\n\nAnother possibility is John Lennon. He left the Beatles in 1969 and started his solo career. His first solo album was \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" in 1970, and then \"Imagine\" in 1971. But \"Imagine\" isn't a self-titled album, although it features some of his most famous hits.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps it's Donovan. He was a Scottish singer-songwriter who was popular in the late '60s and early '70s. His album \"Atlantis\" was released in 1971, but it's not self-titled. Not sure about that.\n\nLet me consider Cat Stevens, who later became Yusuf Islam. He had a self-titled album \"Cat Stevens\" in 1967, but again, that's not 1971.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe it's a less well-known artist. Or perhaps the nickname \"White Duke\" is associated with someone else besides David Bowie.\n\nWait, David Bowie was called the \"White Face\" in some contexts, but \"White Duke\" is more associated with his persona during the \"Diamond Dogs\" period, which was in 1974. Still not 1971.\n\nMaybe it's Elton John after all. His 1971 album \"Elton John\" featured hits like \"Your Song\" and \"Take Me to the Pilot.\" But I thought that was his debut, which it wasn't; his debut was in 1969.\n\nActually, Elton John's second album was \"Elton John\" in 1970, and then \"Tumbleweed Connection\" in 1970, and \"Lieutenant Pigeon\" in 1973. Hmm, seems like I need to double-check the release dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Rod Stewart's self-titled debut in 1971, which included hits like \"Maggie May\" and \"Reason to Believe.\" But I'm not sure if he was referred to as the \"White Duke.\"\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's Marc Bolan of T. Rex. They had a very successful period in the early '70s. Their album \"Electric Warrior\" was in 1971, but that's not self-titled.\n\nWait, maybe it's Cat Stevens again. He had an album \"Mona Bone Jakon\" in 1971, but that's not self-titled.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try another approach. Who was referred to as the \"White Duke\" in the British rock scene around 1971?\n\nDavid Bowie was sometimes called the \"White Face\" or the \"Thin White Duke,\" but the \"Thin White Duke\" persona came later, in the '70s, with the album \"Station to Station\" in 1976.\n\nHmm, maybe it's Elton John. He had a white Duke costume in one of his performances, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, Elton John wore a white Duke outfit in his \"Madman Across the Water\" tour in 1971, but that album was released in 1971, and it's not a self-titled album.\n\nThis is getting more complicated. Maybe the answer is Elton John's self-titled debut in 1969, but that doesn't match the year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a different artist altogether. Let's consider Jeff Beck. He had an album \"Jeff Beck Group\" in 1967, but again, not 1971.\n\nWhat about Jimmy Page? He formed Led Zeppelin in 1968, but their albums aren't self-titled in 1971.\n\nWait, Led Zeppelin did have their first self-titled album in 1969, and their fourth album in 1971, which is untitled, featuring the \"bat logo.\"\n\nNot matching exactly.\n\nPerhaps it's Black Sabbath. Their first album was \"Black Sabbath\" in 1970, and their second was \"Black Sabbath Vol. 2\" in 1970 as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the artist isn't British, or the year is incorrect.\n\nWait, could it be Jackson Browne? He had a self-titled album in 1972, but that's not 1971.\n\nAnother possibility: Leonard Cohen's \"Songs of Leonard Cohen\" was in 1967, not 1971.\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe I need to consider European artists, not just British ones.\n\nWait, no, the question specifies a British rock legend.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's actually 1970 or 1972.\n\nLet me check 1970 options. Elton John's self-titled second album was in 1970, but the question says 1971.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a compilation or greatest hits album released in 1971.\n\nWait, but the question specifies a self-titled album, not a compilation.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe it's a collaborative album.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a band's self-titled album featuring a British rock legend.\n\nFor example, Blind Faith had a self-titled album in 1969, featuring Eric Clapton, but that's not 1971.\n\nAnother example: Derek and the Dominos' \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\" was in 1970.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's Jethro Tull's \"Aqualung,\" which was in 1971, but that's not a self-titled album.\n\nAlternatively, Led Zeppelin's fourth album, often called \"Led Zeppelin IV,\" was in 1971, but it's untitled.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps it's a less famous artist. Or maybe I need to consider punk or glam rock artists from that period.\n\nWait, glam rock was rising in the early '70s.\u9664\n\n"
