        "content": "So in this city, there are 100,000 people. Out of these, 60% own cars. So first, I need to find out how many people own cars.\n\nTo find 60% of 100,000, I can calculate it as follows:\n\n60% of 100,000 = (60/100) * 100,000 = 0.6 * 100,000 = 60,000\n\nSo, 60,000 people own cars.\n\nNow, among these car owners, 40% have electric cars. So, I need to find out how many of these 60,000 car owners have electric cars.\n\nTo find 40% of 60,000, I can calculate it as follows:\n\n40% of 60,000 = (40/100) * 60,000 = 0.4 * 60,000 = 24,000\n\nTherefore, 24,000 people in this city own electric cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]"
