        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a mixture contains alcohol and water in the ratio of 3:5, and there are 24 liters of alcohol. I need to find out how many liters of water are present.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The ratio of alcohol to water is 3:5. That means for every 3 parts of alcohol, there are 5 parts of water. So, the total parts in the mixture are 3 + 5 = 8 parts.\n\nNow, I know that the alcohol is 24 liters, and that corresponds to 3 parts of the total 8 parts. I need to find out what 5 parts would be, since that's the water.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find out how much one part is and then multiply it by 5 to get the water.\n\nSo, if 3 parts are 24 liters, then one part is 24 liters divided by 3, which is 8 liters.\n\nNow, since water is 5 parts, I can multiply 5 by 8 liters to get 40 liters.\n\nSo, there are 40 liters of water in the mixture.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nIf alcohol is 24 liters and water is 40 liters, the total mixture is 24 + 40 = 64 liters.\n\nNow, checking the ratio: alcohol to water is 24:40, which simplifies to 3:5 when divided by 8.\n\nYes, that matches the given ratio.\n\nAlternatively, I could have set up a proportion.\n\nGiven that alcohol to water is 3:5, which is the same as 3/5.\n\nSo, if alcohol is 24 liters, then:\n\n3/5 = 24/water\n\nSo, water = (5/3)*24 = 40 liters.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
