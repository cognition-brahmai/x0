        "content": "So I've got this problem here about candies in a bag. There are 14 red candies, 9 blue candies, and 7 green candies. I need to find the probability of picking a red candy at random. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a red candy, and the total outcomes are all the candies in the bag.\n\nSo, the formula for probability is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Red Candies}}{\\text{Total Number of Candies}} \\]\n\nI know there are 14 red candies. Now, I need to find the total number of candies. That should be the sum of all the candies of each color.\n\nTotal candies = Red candies + Blue candies + Green candies\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal candies = 14 + 9 + 7\n\nLet me add those up: 14 plus 9 is 23, and then 23 plus 7 is 30. So, there are 30 candies in total.\n\nNow, going back to the probability formula:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{14}{30} \\]\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2.\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{14 \\div 2}{30 \\div 2} = \\frac{7}{15} \\]\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red candy is \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this. Sometimes probabilities can be expressed as decimals or percentages, but since the question didn't specify, I'll stick with the fraction.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should confirm my total count. Let's count again: 14 red, 9 blue, 7 green. Yeah, that's 30 overall.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of proportions, the red candies make up a certain part of the whole bag. So, \\(\\frac{14}{30}\\) is indeed the proportion of red candies.\n\nI can also think about it in terms of percentages to understand it better. If I divide 14 by 30, that's approximately 0.4667, which is about 46.67%. So, there's roughly a 46.67% chance of picking a red candy.\n\nBut since the question asks to show my work, I think presenting it as a simplified fraction is sufficient.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the probability, like whether the candies are equally likely to be picked. The problem says \"randomly picking,\" so I assume each candy has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nAlso, there's no mention of pulling out candies one after another or replacing them, so it's probably just a single draw.\n\nTherefore, my final answer remains \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{15}} \\]"
