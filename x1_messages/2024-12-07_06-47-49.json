        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 7 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, in total, there are 7 + 6 + 5 = 18 balls in the bag. The question is, if I pick one ball at random, what's the probability that it's either red or blue.\n\nOkay, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball. So, the number of favorable outcomes should be the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, which is 7 + 6 = 13.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 18.\n\nSo, the probability should be 13/18.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of complementary probability. The complement of picking a red or blue ball is picking a green ball. The probability of picking a green ball is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/18.\n\nSo, the probability of picking either red or blue could also be 1 minus the probability of picking green, which is 1 - 5/18 = 13/18.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. So, the probability is 13/18.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Are the balls different in any way besides color? The problem doesn't say, so I'm assuming they're identical except for color.\n\nAlso, picking without looking suggests that each ball has an equal chance of being picked, so the probability is solely based on the ratio of colors.\n\nIs there any chance that balls can be added or removed while picking? No, it's a single pick from the bag.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 13/18 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{18}} \\]"
