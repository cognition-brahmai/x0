        "content": "Let's see. So, the train travels at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour and takes 7 hours to reach its destination. It stops at 6 stations along the way, and the total time spent at stations is 1 hour. I need to find out how long it spends at each station.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total time of the journey. The train takes 7 hours to reach its destination, and during this time, it spends some time stopped at stations. The total time spent at stations is 1 hour. So, the actual time moving is 7 hours minus 1 hour, which is 6 hours.\n\nNow, the train is moving at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour for 6 hours. So, the distance covered while moving is 80 km/h * 6 h = 480 kilometers.\n\nBut wait, the total journey time is 7 hours, including stops. The time spent moving is 6 hours, and the time spent stopping is 1 hour. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the train stops at 6 stations, and the total stopping time is 1 hour. To find out how long it spends at each station, I can divide the total stopping time by the number of stations.\n\nSo, time per station = total stopping time / number of stations = 1 hour / 6 stations.\n\nThat would be 1/6 hour per station.\n\nBut maybe the user wants the time in minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1/6 of an hour is 60 minutes / 6 = 10 minutes per station.\n\nSo, the train spends 10 minutes at each station.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal journey time: 7 hours\n\nTime spent moving: 6 hours (since it's moving at 80 km/h for 6 hours to cover 480 km)\n\nTime spent stopping: 1 hour (total)\n\nNumber of stations: 6\n\nTime per station: 1 hour / 6 = 10 minutes\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average speed includes the stopping time. But the problem says it travels at an average speed of 80 km/h and takes 7 hours to reach its destination, and it stops at 6 stations with a total stopping time of 1 hour.\n\nSo, the average speed is calculated over the entire journey, including stops. But in that case, the average speed would be total distance divided by total time, which is 480 km / 7 h \u2248 68.57 km/h. But the problem says the average speed is 80 km/h.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf the train is moving at 80 km/h for 6 hours, it covers 480 km. If the total journey time is 7 hours, including 1 hour of stopping, then the average speed for the entire journey would be total distance (480 km) divided by total time (7 h), which is approximately 68.57 km/h. But the problem states that the average speed is 80 km/h.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 80 km/h is the speed while moving, and the average speed over the entire journey is different because of the stopping time.\n\nSo, perhaps the average speed over the entire journey, including stops, is less than 80 km/h.\n\nBut the problem says the average speed is 80 km/h, which includes the stopping time.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the average speed is calculated including the stopping time.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time, where total time includes both moving and stopping.\n\nIf the average speed is 80 km/h and the total time is 7 hours, then the total distance is 80 km/h * 7 h = 560 km.\n\nBut earlier, if it moves for 6 hours at 80 km/h, it should cover 480 km, but according to this, the total distance is 560 km.\n\nThat doesn't make sense. There's a inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 80 km/h is the speed while moving, and the average speed over the entire journey, including stops, is less.\n\nLet me try calculating it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- v_m = speed while moving = 80 km/h\n\n- t_m = time moving\n\n- t_s = stopping time = 1 hour\n\n- t_total = total time = 7 hours\n\n- d = total distance\n\nWe know that t_total = t_m + t_s, so t_m = t_total - t_s = 7 h - 1 h = 6 h.\n\nThen, d = v_m * t_m = 80 km/h * 6 h = 480 km.\n\nThe average speed over the entire journey is d / t_total = 480 km / 7 h \u2248 68.57 km/h.\n\nBut the problem states that the average speed is 80 km/h.\n\nThis suggests that either the average speed includes only the moving time, or there's an error in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 80 km/h is the average speed including stops.\n\nIf that's the case, then d = 80 km/h * 7 h = 560 km.\n\nThen, time moving t_m = d / v_m = 560 km / 80 km/h = 7 h.\n\nBut if t_m = 7 h and t_s = 1 h, then total time = t_m + t_s = 8 h, which contradicts the given total time of 7 h.\n\nThis is confusing. There seems to be an inconsistency in the problem as stated.\n\nPerhaps the 80 km/h is the speed while moving, and the average speed over the entire journey, including stops, is not specified directly.\n\nIn that case, we can proceed with the initial approach:\n\nTotal moving time: 6 hours\n\nTotal stopping time: 1 hour\n\nNumber of stops: 6\n\nTime per stop: 1 hour / 6 = 10 minutes\n\nSo, the train spends 10 minutes at each station.\n\nAlternatively, if the average speed is indeed 80 km/h over the entire journey, including stops, then the total distance is 80 km/h * 7 h = 560 km.\n\nIf the train is moving at 80 km/h for t_m hours and stopped for t_s = 1 hour, with t_m + t_s = 7 h, so t_m = 6 h.\n\nThen, distance = 80 km/h * 6 h = 480 km, but according to the average speed, it should be 560 km.\n\nThis suggests that the speed while moving is higher than 80 km/h, or there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 80 km/h is the average speed including stops.\n\nIn that case, distance = 80 km/h * 7 h = 560 km.\n\nIf the train is moving at speed v_m for 6 hours and stopped for 1 hour, then distance = v_m * 6 h = 560 km, so v_m = 560 km / 6 h \u2248 93.33 km/h.\n\nThis would mean the train is moving at 93.33 km/h for 6 hours to cover 560 km, and stopped for 1 hour at 6 stations.\n\nBut the problem says the train travels at an average speed of 80 km/h, which is the overall average including stops.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from the definition of \"average speed.\"\n\nAverage speed is total distance divided by total time, including stops.\n\nIf the train has an average speed of 80 km/h over 7 hours, then the total distance is 560 km.\n\nIf the train stops at 6 stations for a total of 1 hour, then the moving time is 6 hours.\n\nSo, speed while moving = total distance / moving time = 560 km / 6 h \u2248 93.33 km/h.\n\nBut the problem states that the train travels at an average speed of 80 km/h, which seems to suggest that 80 km/h includes the stopping time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 80 km/h is the speed while moving, and the average speed over the entire journey is less due to stops.\n\nIn that case, average speed = total distance / total time = d / 7 h.\n\nIf the speed while moving is 80 km/h and moving time is 6 h, then d = 480 km.\n\nThus, average speed = 480 km / 7 h \u2248 68.57 km/h.\n\nBut the problem says the average speed is 80 km/h, which contradicts this.\n\nTherefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"average speed of 80 km/h\" is the speed considering only the moving time, not including stops.\n\nIn that case, distance = 80 km/h * moving time.\n\nTotal time = moving time + stopping time = t_m + 1 h = 7 h \u21d2 t_m = 6 h.\n\nThus, distance = 80 km/h * 6 h = 480 km.\n\nAverage speed over entire journey = 480 km / 7 h \u2248 68.57 km/h.\n\nBut the problem says the average speed is 80 km/h, which doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the problem might have incorrect data or is misstated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the train's average speed includes the stopping time, meaning overall average speed is 80 km/h over 7 hours, covering 560 km, and it stops for a total of 1 hour at 6 stations.\n\nIn this case, moving time is 6 hours, distance is 560 km, so speed while moving is 560 km / 6 h \u2248 93.33 km/h.\n\nBut the problem states the train travels at 80 km/h, which now seems to be the overall average speed, not the moving speed.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. I think the initial approach is simpler and more likely correct.\n\nTotal stopping time is 1 hour, number of stations is 6, so time per station is 1 hour / 6 \u2248 10 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the train spends approximately 10 minutes at each station.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
