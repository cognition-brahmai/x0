        "content": "To determine the equilibrium price and quantity in a market, we need to find the point where the quantity demanded (Qd) equals the quantity supplied (Qs). This is because at equilibrium, the amount of goods that consumers are willing and able to buy matches the amount that producers are willing and able to sell.\n\nGiven the demand function:\n\\[ Qd = 100 - 2P \\]\n\nAnd the supply function:\n\\[ Qs = 20 + 3P \\]\n\nWe set Qd equal to Qs to find the equilibrium price (P):\n\\[ 100 - 2P = 20 + 3P \\]\n\nNow, we solve for P.\n\nFirst, let's get all the terms involving P on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side.\n\nAdd 2P to both sides:\n\\[ 100 = 20 + 5P \\]\n\nNow, subtract 20 from both sides:\n\\[ 80 = 5P \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 5 to solve for P:\n\\[ P = \\frac{80}{5} \\]\n\\[ P = 16 \\]\n\nSo, the equilibrium price is $16.\n\nNow, to find the equilibrium quantity, we can plug this value of P back into either the demand or supply equation. Let's use the demand equation:\n\n\\[ Qd = 100 - 2(16) \\]\n\\[ Qd = 100 - 32 \\]\n\\[ Qd = 68 \\]\n\nAlternatively, using the supply equation:\n\n\\[ Qs = 20 + 3(16) \\]\n\\[ Qs = 20 + 48 \\]\n\\[ Qs = 68 \\]\n\nBoth methods give us the same equilibrium quantity, which is 68 units.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price is $16 and the equilibrium quantity is 68 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{P = 16, \\ Q = 68} \\]"
