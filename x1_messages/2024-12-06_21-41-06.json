        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total. 18 play soccer, 12 play basketball, and 8 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports. Since some students play both sports, I can't just add the number of soccer players and basketball players together because that would count the students who play both sports twice.\n\nSo, I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That means I add the number of soccer players and the number of basketball players, and then subtract the number of students who play both sports to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet's do that:\n\nNumber of students who play at least one sport = number of soccer players + number of basketball players - number of students who play both sports.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 18 + 12 - 8\n\n= 30 - 8\n\n= 22 students.\n\nSo, 22 students play at least one sport.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I subtract the number of students who play at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nNumber of students who don't play either sport = total students - students who play at least one sport.\n\n= 30 - 22\n\n= 8 students.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal students = 30\n\nSoccer players = 18\n\nBasketball players = 12\n\nBoth sports = 8\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nOnly soccer = soccer players - both sports = 18 - 8 = 10\n\nOnly basketball = basketball players - both sports = 12 - 8 = 4\n\nSo, only soccer = 10, only basketball = 4, both sports = 8.\n\nTotal playing at least one sport = 10 + 4 + 8 = 22\n\nStudents not playing any sport = 30 - 22 = 8\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sets.\n\nLet S be the set of soccer players, B be the set of basketball players.\n\nWe know:\n\n|S| = 18\n\n|B| = 12\n\n|S \u2229 B| = 8\n\nWe need to find the number of students not in S \u222a B.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B| = 18 + 12 - 8 = 22\n\nAnd total students are 30, so students not playing any sport are 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nThis confirms my answer.\n\nI think 8 is the correct number of students who don't play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
