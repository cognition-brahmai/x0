        "content": "So here's the scenario: Grandpa hides a gold coin in a brown box inside the living room cabinet for a treasure hunt game for his grandchildren. Then, Aunt Mary overhears this and decides to make the game more challenging by moving the gold coin to a white box in the kitchen. After that, Cousin Steve sees Aunt Mary moving the coin and decides to move it again, placing it inside a black box in the garage.\n\nI need to figure out where each family member involved thinks the gold coin is hidden.\n\nLet's start with Grandpa. He originally hid the gold coin in the brown box in the living room cabinet. He doesn't know that Aunt Mary moved it to the white box in the kitchen, and he also doesn't know that Cousin Steve moved it again to the black box in the garage. So, Grandpa thinks the gold coin is still in the brown box in the living room cabinet.\n\nNext is Aunt Mary. She overheard Grandpa hiding the gold coin in the brown box in the living room cabinet and decided to move it to the white box in the kitchen. She doesn't know that Cousin Steve saw her move it and moved it again to the black box in the garage. Therefore, Aunt Mary thinks the gold coin is in the white box in the kitchen.\n\nNow, Cousin Steve saw Aunt Mary move the gold coin from the brown box in the living room cabinet to the white box in the kitchen. Then, he moved it again to the black box in the garage. Since he was present when Aunt Mary moved it and he moved it himself afterward, he knows the current location of the gold coin, which is in the black box in the garage.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Grandpa thinks it's in the brown box in the living room cabinet.\n\n- Aunt Mary thinks it's in the white box in the kitchen.\n\n- Cousin Steve knows it's in the black box in the garage.\n\nI hope this makes sense. It's like a game of musical chairs with the gold coin!"
