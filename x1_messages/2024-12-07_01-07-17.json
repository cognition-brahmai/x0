        "content": "Love, a force so vast and deep,\nA river flowing, never asleep.\nIn its currents, we find our truth,\nOur hopes, our dreams, our very youth.\n\nIt bends like willow in the wind,\nYet stands as oak, most strong and kind.\nThrough joy and sorrow, love endures,\nA beacon in life's darkest hours.\n\nIt heals the wounds of yesterday,\nAnd lights the path for brighter day.\nWith love, we rise above the pain,\nAnd find the strength to love again.\n\nFor love is not just feeling's flight,\nBut action, courage, and pure light.\nIt binds us to each other's hearts,\nCreating bridges across the arts.\n\nMaya once wrote, \"Love recognizes no barriers.\nIt jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope.\""
