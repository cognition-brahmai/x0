        "content": "Let's see. There are 60 students in the class, and 35% of them are girls. I need to find out how many boys there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many girls there are. If 35% of the class are girls, then I can calculate the number of girls by taking 35% of 60.\n\nTo calculate 35% of 60, I can multiply 60 by 0.35.\n\nSo, 60 times 0.35 is... let's see, 60 times 0.3 is 18, and 60 times 0.05 is 3, so adding those together, 18 plus 3 is 21. So, there are 21 girls in the class.\n\nNow, to find the number of boys, I can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.\n\nSo, 60 minus 21 equals 39.\n\nTherefore, there are 39 boys in the class.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 35% of 60 should be 21, as I calculated earlier. And then, 60 minus 21 is indeed 39.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. If 35% are girls, then the remaining percentage must be boys. So, 100% minus 35% equals 65%. So, 65% of the class are boys.\n\nNow, to find 65% of 60, I can multiply 60 by 0.65.\n\n60 times 0.65... well, 60 times 0.6 is 36, and 60 times 0.05 is 3, so 36 plus 3 is 39.\n\nSo, again, I get 39 boys in the class.\n\nHmm, that matches my previous calculation. So, I think 39 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if 21 girls and 39 boys add up to 60.\n\n21 plus 39 is 60. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in fractions. 35% is equivalent to 35/100, which simplifies to 7/20.\n\nSo, the number of girls is 7/20 of 60.\n\nCalculating 7/20 of 60: (7/20) * 60 = (7 * 60) / 20 = 420 / 20 = 21.\n\nAgain, confirming that there are 21 girls.\n\nAnd then, 60 minus 21 is 39 boys.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is 39 boys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{39} \\]"
