        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular room with an area of 120 square meters, and it's given that the length is twice its width. We need to find the dimensions, which means finding both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if we let the width be some value, say 'w' meters, then the length would be twice that, which is '2w' meters.\n\nSo, the area A = length \u00d7 width = 2w \u00d7 w = 2w\u00b2.\n\nBut we know the area is 120 square meters, so we can set up the equation:\n\n2w\u00b2 = 120.\n\nNow, to find 'w', I need to solve this equation. Let's divide both sides by 2:\n\nw\u00b2 = 60.\n\nThen, take the square root of both sides:\n\nw = \u221a60.\n\nHmm, \u221a60 can be simplified. I know that 60 = 4 \u00d7 15, and \u221a(4\u00d715) = \u221a4 \u00d7 \u221a15 = 2\u221a15.\n\nSo, w = 2\u221a15 meters.\n\nBut let's see if this makes sense. Let me calculate the numerical value. \u221a15 is approximately 3.873, so 2\u00d73.873 is about 7.746 meters for the width.\n\nThen, the length is twice that, so about 15.492 meters.\n\nLet's check the area: 7.746 \u00d7 15.492 should be around 120.\n\nCalculating that: 7.746 \u00d7 15.492 = approximately 120.00 square meters. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to express this without decimals. Let's see.\n\nWe have w = 2\u221a15 meters, and length l = 2w = 4\u221a15 meters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express it in terms of rational numbers.\n\nWait, 2\u221a15 is exactly the value, and since 15 isn't a perfect square, it can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, the exact dimensions are:\n\nWidth: 2\u221a15 meters,\n\nLength: 4\u221a15 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if we prefer decimal approximations, width is approximately 7.746 meters and length is approximately 15.492 meters.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify whether to use exact values or approximations, I'll go with the exact values.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the room are 2\u221a15 meters in width and 4\u221a15 meters in length.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the room are \\boxed{2\\sqrt{15} \\text{ meters in width and } 4\\sqrt{15} \\text{ meters in length}}."
