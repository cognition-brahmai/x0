        "content": "Yes, absinthe is an alcoholic beverage that contains a compound called thujone, which is known to have psychoactive properties. Thujone is a chemical compound found in the wormwood plant, which is one of the key ingredients in absinthe. When consumed in large quantities, thujone can cause hallucinations, seizures, and other dangerous side effects. For this reason, absinthe was banned in many countries for several decades, although it has since been legalized in some places with restrictions on thujone content. It's important to note that absinthe should be consumed responsibly and in moderation, as with any alcoholic beverage."
