        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 widgets per day, and each widget has a 2% chance of being defective. I need to find out the expected number of defective widgets in one week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and the factory produces 200 widgets each day, the total number of widgets produced in a week would be:\n\n200 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 1400 widgets/week\n\nNow, each widget has a 2% chance of being defective. To find the expected number of defective widgets, I can multiply the total number of widgets by the probability of being defective.\n\nBut wait, probability is usually expressed as a decimal. 2% is equal to 0.02 in decimal form.\n\nSo, expected number of defective widgets = total widgets * probability of being defective\n\nExpected defective widgets = 1400 * 0.02\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1400 * 0.02 = 28\n\nSo, the expected number of defective widgets produced by the factory in one week is 28.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should approach this differently. Maybe using the concept of expected value in probability.\n\nThe expected value for a binomial distribution is given by n * p, where n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of widgets), and p is the probability of success (or in this case, the probability of a widget being defective).\n\nSo, again, expected defective widgets = n * p = 1400 * 0.02 = 28\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it on a daily basis and then extend it to a week.\n\nDaily expected defective widgets = 200 * 0.02 = 4\n\nThen, for seven days, it would be 4 * 7 = 28\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
