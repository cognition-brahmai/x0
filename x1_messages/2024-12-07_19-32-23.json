        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, and I need to find the probability of drawing 2 red balls in a row without putting the first one back. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing two red balls in a row without replacement.\n\nSo, step one: what's the probability of drawing the first red ball?\n\nWell, there are 4 red balls and a total of 4 + 6 = 10 balls in the bag. So, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 4 out of 10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, since we're not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first draw. So, for the second draw, there are now 9 balls left in the bag.\n\nIf the first ball was red, then there are now 3 red balls left out of the 9 remaining balls. So, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 3/9, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening consecutively, I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red balls in a row without replacement is (2/5) * (1/3).\n\nLet's calculate that: (2/5) * (1/3) = 2/15.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/15.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 10 is calculated using combinations, which is \"10 choose 2.\" That's 10! divided by (2! * (10-2)!), which simplifies to (10*9)/2 = 45.\n\nNow, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of the 4 red balls is \"4 choose 2,\" which is (4*3)/2 = 6.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing 2 red balls is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 6/45, which simplifies to 2/15.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the probability of drawing the first red ball and then the second red ball without replacement.\n\nProbability of first red ball: 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nGiven that the first ball was red, probability of second red ball: 3/9 = 1/3.\n\nMultiply them: (2/5)*(1/3) = 2/15.\n\nSame answer again. Seems consistent.\n\nI think 2/15 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{15}} \\]"
