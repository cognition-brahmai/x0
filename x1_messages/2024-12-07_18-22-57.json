        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have apples coming in bags of 6 and oranges in bags of 4. The customer wants to buy the same number of apples and oranges. We need to find out the minimum number of each fruit they must purchase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to buy the same number of apples and oranges. That means the total number of apples should equal the total number of oranges.\n\nNow, apples are sold in bags of 6, so if someone buys one bag, they get 6 apples. Oranges are sold in bags of 4, so one bag gives 4 oranges. But since the customer wants the same number of each, we can't just buy one bag of each because 6 apples \u2260 4 oranges.\n\nSo, we need to find a way to make the number of apples equal to the number of oranges by buying multiple bags of each.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of bags of apples bought.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the number of bags of oranges bought.\n\nThen, the total number of apples is \\( 6a \\), and the total number of oranges is \\( 4o \\).\n\nWe want \\( 6a = 4o \\).\n\nThis equation needs to be satisfied for some positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( o \\), since you can't buy fractions of bags.\n\nSo, \\( 6a = 4o \\). Let's try to solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to simplify: \\( 3a = 2o \\).\n\nNow, this tells us that \\( a \\) and \\( o \\) need to be chosen such that when \\( a \\) is multiplied by 3 and \\( o \\) by 2, they are equal.\n\nLooking for the smallest positive integers that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's try \\( a = 1 \\):\n\n\\( 3(1) = 3 \\), so \\( 2o = 3 \\), which would mean \\( o = 1.5 \\). But we can't buy half a bag, so that's not allowed.\n\nNext, \\( a = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 3(2) = 6 \\), so \\( 2o = 6 \\), which gives \\( o = 3 \\). That works.\n\nSo, \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( o = 3 \\) is a possible solution.\n\nLet's check if this is indeed the smallest possible.\n\nIf \\( a = 1 \\), \\( o = 1.5 \\) doesn't work.\n\nIf \\( a = 2 \\), \\( o = 3 \\), that works.\n\nIs there a smaller solution where both \\( a \\) and \\( o \\) are integers?\n\nLet's see \\( a = 3 \\):\n\n\\( 3(3) = 9 \\), so \\( 2o = 9 \\), \\( o = 4.5 \\). Not allowed.\n\n\\( a = 4 \\):\n\n\\( 3(4) = 12 \\), \\( 2o = 12 \\), \\( o = 6 \\). That's another solution, but it's larger than \\( a = 2 \\), \\( o = 3 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = 2 \\), \\( o = 3 \\) seems to be the smallest solution.\n\nNow, the question asks for the minimum number of each fruit they must purchase.\n\nSo, number of apples = \\( 6a = 6(2) = 12 \\).\n\nNumber of oranges = \\( 4o = 4(3) = 12 \\).\n\nSo, the customer needs to buy 12 apples and 12 oranges.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the same number of apples and oranges\", which we've achieved, but it's asking for the minimum number of each fruit they must purchase.\n\nIs there a way to buy fewer than 12 of each?\n\nLet's think about it differently. Maybe there's a mathematical concept here.\n\nWe have \\( 6a = 4o \\), which simplifies to \\( 3a = 2o \\).\n\nThis is a Diophantine equation, where we're looking for integer solutions.\n\nThe general solution would be \\( a = 2k \\), \\( o = 3k \\), for any positive integer \\( k \\).\n\nWhen \\( k = 1 \\), \\( a = 2 \\), \\( o = 3 \\), giving 12 apples and 12 oranges.\n\nIf \\( k = 2 \\), \\( a = 4 \\), \\( o = 6 \\), giving 24 apples and 24 oranges, which is more than 12.\n\nSo, the minimal solution is indeed \\( k = 1 \\), with 12 apples and 12 oranges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to buy fewer fruits by buying bags that are multiples of certain numbers.\n\nLet me think about the least common multiple (LCM).\n\nThe LCM of 6 and 4 is 12.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The LCM of the bag sizes is 12.\n\nSo, 12 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 6 and 4.\n\nWhich aligns with our earlier calculation that 12 apples and 12 oranges is the minimal number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to buy fewer fruits by buying different numbers of bags.\n\nSuppose we buy 1 bag of apples (6 apples) and some number of bags of oranges.\n\nBut 6 is not a multiple of 4, so we can't have the same number of oranges.\n\nSimilarly, buying 2 bags of apples gives 12 apples, and 3 bags of oranges give 12 oranges, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, buying 3 bags of apples gives 18 apples, which would require 4.5 bags of oranges, not allowed.\n\nBuying 4 bags of apples gives 24 apples, requiring 6 bags of oranges (24 oranges), but that's more than 12.\n\nSo, again, 12 apples and 12 oranges seems to be the minimal solution.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe using multiples.\n\nMultiples of 6 for apples: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...\n\nMultiples of 4 for oranges: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ...\n\nThe smallest common multiple is 12.\n\nSo, 12 apples and 12 oranges.\n\nTherefore, the customer must purchase at least 12 apples and 12 oranges.\n\nIn terms of bags, that's 2 bags of apples and 3 bags of oranges.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the number of fruits, not bags.\n\nSo, the answer should be 12 apples and 12 oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
