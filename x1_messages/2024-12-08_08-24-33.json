        "content": "So there's this scenario where a group of people is splitting the cost of renting a boat equally. Initially, there are 12 people, and the boat rental costs $600. But then, three more people decide to join the group before they pay. The question is, how much does each person pay after these three additional people join?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, we need to find out the total number of people after the three more join. So, if there were originally 12 people and 3 more join, that makes a total of:\n\n12 + 3 = 15 people\n\nNow, the total cost of the boat rental is $600, and this cost is to be split equally among these 15 people. So, to find out how much each person has to pay, we need to divide the total cost by the number of people:\n\nEach person's share = Total cost / Number of people\nEach person's share = $600 / 15\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n$600 divided by 15 is $40.\n\nSo, each person would pay $40.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If 15 people each pay $40, then the total amount collected would be:\n\n15 * $40 = $600\n\nYes, that matches the total cost of the boat rental. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it another way. Initially, there were 12 people planning to split $600. So, originally, each of the 12 would have paid:\n\n$600 / 12 = $50\n\nBut then, 3 more people join, making it 15 people in total. So, the cost is now divided among 15 people, which, as calculated earlier, is $40 per person.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see how much each person saves by having 3 more people join. Originally, it was $50 per person, but with 15 people, it's $40 per person. So, each of the original 12 people saves $10 each by having 3 more people share the cost.\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount each person pays after the three more people join. So, the answer is $40 per person.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Is there any other angle I should consider here? Maybe I should consider if the three additional people pay the same amount as the original group. Assuming it's an equal split, yes, everyone pays the same amount, regardless of when they joined.\n\nSo, in conclusion, each person pays $40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
