        "content": "So the factory originally produces 2000 units of product A each day, and each unit costs $10 to make. That means their daily cost is 2000 units times $10 per unit, which is $20,000 per day.\n\nNow, they decide to increase production by 25%. To find out what 25% of 2000 is, I can calculate 25% of 2000, which is 0.25 times 2000, equaling 500 units. So, the new production amount is 2000 units plus 500 units, which is 2500 units per day.\n\nBut, this increase in production leads to an increased cost of $2 per unit. That means the cost per unit goes up from $10 to $10 plus $2, which is $12 per unit.\n\nTo find the new daily cost, I need to multiply the new production amount by the new cost per unit. So, 2500 units times $12 per unit.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 2500 times 12.\n\nWell, 2500 times 10 is 25,000, and 2500 times 2 is 5,000. So, adding those together, 25,000 plus 5,000 equals $30,000.\n\nTherefore, the new daily cost of producing product A is $30,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I understood the problem correctly. The cost increased by $2 per unit, so from $10 to $12 per unit, and production increased by 25% from 2000 to 2500 units. Multiplying 2500 by $12 does indeed give $30,000.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the increase in cost due to more units and the increase per unit.\n\nOriginal cost: 2000 units * $10 = $20,000.\n\nIncrease in units: 500 units.\n\nCost per unit now: $12.\n\nSo, new cost: (2000 units * $12) plus (500 units * $12).\n\n2000 * 12 is 24,000, and 500 * 12 is 6,000. Adding those gives 24,000 + 6,000 = $30,000.\n\nWait, that's the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total increase in cost.\n\nOriginal cost: $20,000.\n\nIncrease in units: 500 units.\n\nEach of these additional units costs $12.\n\nBut, I think that's getting confusing. The straightforward way is to calculate the new production amount times the new cost per unit.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total cost using the original production and the increase separately.\n\nOriginal production: 2000 units * $12 = $24,000.\n\nAdditional production: 500 units * $12 = $6,000.\n\nTotal: $24,000 + $6,000 = $30,000.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that the production increased by 25%, so the production factor is 1.25 times the original production.\n\nOriginal production: 2000 units.\n\nNew production: 2000 * 1.25 = 2500 units.\n\nCost per unit increased by $2, so new cost per unit is $12.\n\nTherefore, new daily cost is 2500 units * $12/unit = $30,000.\n\nI think that's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that $30,000 is the correct new daily cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000} \\]"
