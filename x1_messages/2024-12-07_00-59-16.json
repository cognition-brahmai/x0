This idea comes from the fairy tale \"Cinderella,\" where a pumpkin is magically transformed into a carriage by her fairy godmother. In reality, pumpkins are vegetables that do not possess magical abilities and cannot transform into other objects. The transformation in the story is a fictional element used to create an enchanting narrative."
