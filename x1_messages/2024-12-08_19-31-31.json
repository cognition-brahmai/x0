        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a book that originally costs $40, and it's being sold at a 25% discount. After applying the discount, there's also a 10% sales tax added to the discounted price. We need to find out the final amount the customer has to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the discount. A 25% discount on $40 means the customer saves 25% of $40. To find 25% of $40, I can multiply 40 by 0.25.\n\nSo, 40 \u00d7 0.25 = 10.\n\nThat means the discount is $10. So, the discounted price of the book is original price minus the discount: $40 - $10 = $30.\n\nNow, after the discount, there's a 10% sales tax added to the discounted price. So, I need to calculate 10% of $30 and then add that to the $30.\n\nFirst, find 10% of $30. That's 30 \u00d7 0.10 = $3.\n\nSo, the sales tax is $3. Now, add that to the discounted price: $30 + $3 = $33.\n\nTherefore, the final amount the customer has to pay is $33.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes, these problems can be tricky, and I might be missing something.\n\nAnother way to think about the discount is to realize that a 25% discount means the customer pays 75% of the original price. Because 100% - 25% = 75%.\n\nSo, 75% of $40 is 0.75 \u00d7 40 = $30. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, adding a 10% sales tax on the discounted price of $30: 10% of $30 is $3, and $30 + $3 = $33.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the sales tax as increasing the discounted price by 10%. So, multiplying the discounted price by 1.10.\n\nThat is, $30 \u00d7 1.10 = $33. Same result.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that the sales tax is applied before the discount or something like that. The problem says the discount is first, followed by adding sales tax on the discounted price, so the order is correct.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I'm not confusion the discount and the tax rates or applying them incorrectly.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n1. Original price: $40\n\n2. Discount: 25% of $40 = $10\n\n3. Discounted price: $40 - $10 = $30\n\n4. Sales tax: 10% of $30 = $3\n\n5. Final price: $30 + $3 = $33\n\nYes, that seems accurate. I can also verify this by considering the overall effect. The customer gets a 25% discount, so they pay 75% of the original price, and then they pay an additional 10% tax on that discounted price.\n\nSo, overall, the final price is 75% of the original price, plus 10% of that 75%.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\nFinal Price = (Original Price \u00d7 (1 - Discount Rate)) \u00d7 (1 + Tax Rate)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFinal Price = ($40 \u00d7 (1 - 0.25)) \u00d7 (1 + 0.10) = ($40 \u00d7 0.75) \u00d7 1.10 = $30 \u00d7 1.10 = $33\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is:\n\n1. Apply the discount: $40 \u00d7 0.75 = $30\n\n2. Apply the tax: $30 \u00d7 1.10 = $33\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think $33 is the correct final amount the customer has to pay.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]"
