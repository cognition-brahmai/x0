        "content": "So the restaurant serves about 200 customers each day, and each of those customers spends around $15 on their meal. The restaurant is open 6 days a week. We want to find out how much money the restaurant makes in a whole year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the daily revenue. That should be the number of customers per day times the average spend per customer. So that's 200 customers times $15 each.\n\n200 \u00d7 15 = 3,000\n\nSo, the restaurant makes $3,000 per day.\n\nNext, since the restaurant is open 6 days a week, I can calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by 6.\n\n3,000 \u00d7 6 = 18,000\n\nSo, the restaurant makes $18,000 per week.\n\nNow, to find out the annual revenue, I need to know how many weeks there are in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.\n\nSo, 18,000 \u00d7 52 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n18,000 \u00d7 50 = 900,000\n\n18,000 \u00d7 2 = 36,000\n\nSo, 900,000 + 36,000 = 936,000\n\nTherefore, the restaurant makes $936,000 in a year.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of days the restaurant is open in a year.\n\nSince it's open 6 days a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of operating days is:\n\n6 \u00d7 52 = 312 days\n\nThen, the annual revenue would be the daily revenue times the number of operating days.\n\nSo, 3,000 \u00d7 312 = ?\n\n3,000 \u00d7 300 = 900,000\n\n3,000 \u00d7 12 = 36,000\n\nSo, again, 900,000 + 36,000 = 936,000\n\nOkay, that matches the previous calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any leap years or extra days.\n\nA regular year has 365 days. If we calculate based on 365 days and the restaurant is open 6 days a week, we might need to verify if 6 \u00d7 52 equals the total operating days.\n\nActually, 52 weeks would account for 364 days (52 \u00d7 7 = 364), leaving one day extra in a non-leap year.\n\nSo, in a non-leap year, there are 365 days. The restaurant is open 6 days a week, which is 312 days (6 \u00d7 52).\n\nBut there's one extra day. Does the restaurant operate on that extra day?\n\nIf it's a day when the restaurant is closed, then total operating days remain 312.\n\nIf it's a day when the restaurant is open, then it would be 313 days.\n\nSimilarly, in a leap year, there are 366 days, which might affect the calculation.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, often businesses consider 52 weeks in a year for financial projections, which aligns with our earlier calculation of 6 \u00d7 52 = 312 days.\n\nBut to get a more accurate figure, perhaps we should consider the exact number of operating days in a year.\n\nLet's assume that the restaurant is closed on the same day each week, say, every Monday.\n\nThen, in a year with 365 days, there are 52 weeks plus one extra day.\n\nIf the extra day is a day the restaurant is open, then total operating days are 312 + 1 = 313 days.\n\nIn a leap year with 366 days, it would be 313 days if the extra day is an operating day, or 312 if it's a closed day.\n\nFor simplicity, though, and since the question doesn't specify, perhaps it's acceptable to use the 312 days figure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the annual revenue based on the daily revenue and the number of operating days in a year.\n\nSo, daily revenue is $3,000.\n\nOperating days per year are approximately 312.\n\nTherefore, 3,000 \u00d7 312 = 936,000\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the restaurant is open 6 days a week, we can calculate the annual revenue as:\n\nWeekly revenue: $18,000\n\nNumber of weeks in a year: 52\n\nSo, 18,000 \u00d7 52 = 936,000\n\nAgain, the same figure.\n\nBut to be more precise, considering that 52 weeks only account for 364 days, and there might be an extra day, it's possible that the restaurant operates for 313 days in some years.\n\nSo, in that case, annual revenue would be:\n\n3,000 \u00d7 313 = ?\n\n3,000 \u00d7 300 = 900,000\n\n3,000 \u00d7 13 = 39,000\n\nSo, 900,000 + 39,000 = 939,000\n\nBut this is a slight variation from the earlier calculation.\n\nHowever, considering that the extra day may or may not be an operating day, and that leap years add an extra day, it's reasonable to use the 312 days figure for simplicity.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant makes approximately $936,000 in a year.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to account for the extra day, we could take an average over four years, considering leap years, but that might be excessive for this scenario.\n\nSo, I think $936,000 is a fair estimate for the annual revenue of the restaurant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{936000} \\]"
