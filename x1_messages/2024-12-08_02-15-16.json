        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a farmer has 30 animals on his farm, which are either cows or chickens, and together they have 80 legs. I need to find out how many cows there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of cows as \\( c \\) and the number of chickens as \\( h \\).\n\nFrom the problem, I know two things:\n\n1. The total number of animals is 30, so \\( c + h = 30 \\).\n\n2. The total number of legs is 80. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each, so \\( 4c + 2h = 80 \\).\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nc + h = 30 \\\\\n4c + 2h = 80\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nI need to solve for \\( c \\), which represents the number of cows.\n\nOne way to solve this system is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( h \\):\n\n\\( h = 30 - c \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( h \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 4c + 2(30 - c) = 80 \\)\n\nNow, distribute the 2:\n\n\\( 4c + 60 - 2c = 80 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 2c + 60 = 80 \\)\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n\\( 2c = 20 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( c = 10 \\)\n\nSo, there are 10 cows.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. If there are 10 cows, then there are \\( 30 - 10 = 20 \\) chickens.\n\nNow, let's check the legs:\n\n10 cows \u00d7 4 legs each = 40 legs\n\n20 chickens \u00d7 2 legs each = 40 legs\n\nTotal legs: 40 + 40 = 80, which matches the given total.\n\nAlright, so my answer seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used elimination to solve the system of equations. Let's try that method as well to confirm.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nc + h = 30 \\\\\n4c + 2h = 80\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of \\( h \\) the same:\n\n\\( 2c + 2h = 60 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this new equation from the second equation:\n\n\\( (4c + 2h) - (2c + 2h) = 80 - 60 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( 2c = 20 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c = 10 \\), which matches my previous result.\n\nGreat, so regardless of the method I use, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other possibilities. For example, could there be negative numbers of animals or fractions of animals? No, because we're dealing with whole, physical animals, so both \\( c \\) and \\( h \\) must be non-negative integers.\n\nGiven that, and from solving the equations, \\( c = 10 \\) and \\( h = 20 \\) is the only solution that satisfies both the total number of animals and the total number of legs.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The farmer has 10 cows on his farm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
