        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a farmer with 50 hens, and each hen lays 6 eggs per week. We need to find out how many eggs the farmer collects in a month, assuming a month has 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many eggs are laid per week by all the hens together. Since there are 50 hens and each lays 6 eggs per week, I can multiply the number of hens by the number of eggs each lays per week:\n\n50 hens * 6 eggs/hen/week = 300 eggs/week\n\nSo, the farmer collects 300 eggs every week.\n\nNow, to find out the monthly collection, I need to consider that a month has 4 weeks. So, I'll multiply the weekly collection by 4:\n\n300 eggs/week * 4 weeks/month = 1200 eggs/month\n\nTherefore, the farmer collects 1200 eggs in a month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, perhaps the number of eggs per hen per week could be multiplied by the number of weeks first, and then by the number of hens. Let's see:\n\nEach hen lays 6 eggs per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so per hen, in a month:\n\n6 eggs/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 eggs/hen/month\n\nThen, for 50 hens:\n\n50 hens * 24 eggs/hen/month = 1200 eggs/month\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the answer should be 1200 eggs per month.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there might be any other factors affecting this. For example, does the hen lay eggs every week without fail? Is there any chance that the laying rate might change during the month? The problem doesn't mention any such variations, so I'll assume a constant laying rate.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that a month has 4 weeks, which is a common approximation, even though actual months might have slightly more or less days. But since it's given that way, I'll stick to the 4-week month.\n\nSo, my final answer is 1200 eggs per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
