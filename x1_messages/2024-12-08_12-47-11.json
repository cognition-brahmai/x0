The city currently has 100 diesel buses, each with a capacity of 50 passengers. They want to replace 30% of the diesel buses with electric ones, which have a capacity of 60 passengers. Calculate the total passenger capacity of the new mixed fleet and compare it to the current capacity. Also, estimate the cost savings in fuel consumption if an electric bus consumes $0.10 per mile while a diesel bus consumes $0.25 per mile, considering that each bus travels an average of 200 miles per day."

        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, the city has 100 diesel buses, each carrying 50 passengers. So, the current total passenger capacity is:\n\n100 buses * 50 passengers/bus = 5000 passengers\n\nThey plan to replace 30% of these diesel buses with electric ones. 30% of 100 is:\n\n0.30 * 100 = 30 buses\n\nSo, they'll have:\n\n- 70 diesel buses remaining\n\n- 30 electric buses added\n\nNow, the electric buses carry 60 passengers each, so their total capacity is:\n\n30 buses * 60 passengers/bus = 1800 passengers\n\nThe remaining diesel buses' capacity is:\n\n70 buses * 50 passengers/bus = 3500 passengers\n\nTherefore, the total passenger capacity of the new mixed fleet is:\n\n1800 passengers (electric) + 3500 passengers (diesel) = 5300 passengers\n\nComparing this to the current capacity of 5000 passengers, the increase is:\n\n5300 - 5000 = 300 passengers\n\nSo, the new fleet can carry 300 more passengers.\n\nNext, let's estimate the cost savings in fuel consumption.\n\nFirst, find out the daily fuel cost for both types of buses.\n\nEach bus travels 200 miles per day.\n\nFor diesel buses:\n\nConsumption: $0.25 per mile\n\nSo, per bus per day: 200 miles * $0.25/mile = $50\n\nFor electric buses:\n\nConsumption: $0.10 per mile\n\nSo, per bus per day: 200 miles * $0.10/mile = $20\n\nNow, calculate the total daily fuel cost for the new fleet.\n\n70 diesel buses:\n\n70 buses * $50/bus = $3500\n\n30 electric buses:\n\n30 buses * $20/bus = $600\n\nTotal daily fuel cost for the new fleet:\n\n$3500 (diesel) + $600 (electric) = $4100\n\nNow, what was the daily fuel cost before the replacement?\n\n100 diesel buses:\n\n100 buses * $50/bus = $5000\n\nSo, the daily cost savings are:\n\n$5000 (original) - $4100 (new) = $900 per day\n\nThat seems like a significant savings.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the passenger capacity:\n\n- Original: 100 buses * 50 passengers = 5000 passengers\n\n- New: 70 diesel buses * 50 + 30 electric buses * 60 = 3500 + 1800 = 5300 passengers\n\n- Increase: 5300 - 5000 = 300 passengers\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, fuel consumption costs:\n\n- Diesel buses: $0.25 per mile\n\n- Electric buses: $0.10 per mile\n\n- Each bus travels 200 miles per day\n\nSo, cost per bus per day:\n\n- Diesel: 200 * 0.25 = $50\n\n- Electric: 200 * 0.10 = $20\n\nTotal daily cost for new fleet:\n\n- 70 diesel buses: 70 * $50 = $3500\n\n- 30 electric buses: 30 * $20 = $600\n\n- Total: $3500 + $600 = $4100\n\nOriginal total daily cost:\n\n- 100 diesel buses: 100 * $50 = $5000\n\nSavings: $5000 - $4100 = $900 per day\n\nThat looks correct.\n\nSo, by replacing 30% of their diesel buses with electric ones, the city not only increases their total passenger capacity by 300 but also saves $900 per day in fuel costs.\n\nThat's a win-win situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5300 \\text{ passengers, } \\$900 \\text{ daily savings}} \\]"
