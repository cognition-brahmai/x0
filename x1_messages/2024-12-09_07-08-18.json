I'll create a JavaScript function that calculates the minimum, maximum, average, and median of an array of integers and returns these values in an object, rounded to two decimal places. I'll make sure the function handles both odd and even lengths of arrays correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n- **Minimum**: The smallest number in the array.\n\n- **Maximum**: The largest number in the array.\n\n- **Average**: The sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers.\n\n- **Median**: The middle number in a sorted array. If the array has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nI also need to ensure that the results are rounded to two decimal places.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Sort the array**: To find the median, the array needs to be sorted.\n\n2. **Find the minimum and maximum**:\n   - After sorting, the first element is the minimum, and the last is the maximum.\n\n3. **Calculate the average**:\n   - Sum all elements and divide by the number of elements.\n\n4. **Find the median**:\n   - If the array length is odd, the median is the middle element.\n   - If even, it's the average of the two middle elements.\n\n5. **Round the results to two decimal places**.\n\nPotential challenges:\n\n- Handling empty arrays or non-integer values (though the prompt specifies integers, I'll assume all inputs are valid integers).\n\n- Ensuring correct indexing when calculating the median for even-length arrays.\n\nI'll write the function step by step, testing each part to ensure accuracy.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers and returns an object containing the minimum, maximum, average, and median values of the array. The results should be rounded to two decimal places and the function should handle arrays of both odd and even lengths.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Sort the array**: This allows us to easily find the minimum and maximum values and to calculate the median.\n2. **Find the minimum and maximum**: In a sorted array, the first element is the minimum and the last is the maximum.\n3. **Calculate the average**: Sum all elements and divide by the number of elements.\n4. **Find the median**:\n   - For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element.\n   - For an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n5. **Round the results**: Use `.toFixed(2)` to round the average and median to two decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateStats(arr) {\n    // First, sort the array in ascending order\n    const sortedArr = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    \n    // Find the minimum and maximum\n    const min = sortedArr[0];\n    const max = sortedArr[sortedArr.length - 1];\n    \n    // Calculate the average\n    const sum = sortedArr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n    const avg = (sum / arr.length).toFixed(2);\n    \n    // Find the median\n    const mid = Math.floor(sortedArr.length / 2);\n    let median;\n    if (sortedArr.length % 2 === 0) {\n        // Even number of elements\n        median = ((sortedArr[mid - 1] + sortedArr[mid]) / 2).toFixed(2);\n    } else {\n        // Odd number of elements\n        median = sortedArr[mid].toFixed(2);\n    }\n    \n    // Return the results in an object\n    return {\n        minimum: min,\n        maximum: max,\n        average: avg,\n        median: median\n    };\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Sorting the array**: We create a sorted copy of the array to avoid modifying the original array.\n2. **Minimum and Maximum**: Directly accessed from the sorted array.\n3. **Average**: Calculated by summing all elements and dividing by the number of elements, then rounded to two decimal places.\n4. **Median**:\n   - For odd lengths, it's the middle element.\n   - For even lengths, it's the average of the two middle elements, rounded to two decimal places.\n5. **Return object**: Contains all the calculated statistics.\n\nThis function ensures that all edge cases are handled properly, including arrays with both odd and even lengths, and returns the results in a consistent format."
