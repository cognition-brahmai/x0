The company currently produces 10,000 loaves of bread per day at its existing facility, which operates at 80% capacity. The new facility will have twice the production capacity of the current one. Calculate the maximum number of loaves that can be produced daily once the new facility is operational. Also, estimate the time it would take for the company to recoup its $1 million investment in the new facility, given an average profit margin of $0.50 per loaf."

        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, we need to figure out the production capacities.\n\nThe current facility operates at 80% capacity and produces 10,000 loaves per day. So, to find the full capacity of the current facility, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.8 * current full capacity = 10,000 loaves\n\nTherefore, current full capacity = 10,000 / 0.8 = 12,500 loaves per day.\n\nThe new facility has twice the production capacity of the current one, so:\n\nNew facility capacity = 2 * 12,500 = 25,000 loaves per day.\n\nOnce both facilities are operational, the total daily production would be:\n\nTotal production = current production + new facility production = 10,000 + 25,000 = 35,000 loaves per day.\n\nNow, regarding the investment recoupment. The company invested $1 million in the new facility and makes an average profit margin of $0.50 per loaf.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many loaves need to be sold to recoup the $1 million investment.\n\nNumber of loaves needed = total investment / profit per loaf = $1,000,000 / $0.50 = 2,000,000 loaves.\n\nNow, with the new facility producing 25,000 loaves per day, we can calculate the number of days required to produce and sell these 2,000,000 loaves.\n\nNumber of days = total loaves needed / daily production of new facility = 2,000,000 / 25,000 = 80 days.\n\nSo, it would take 80 days of operation at full capacity for the new facility to recoup the $1 million investment, assuming all produced loaves are sold at the average profit margin of $0.50 per loaf.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35000 \\text{ loaves per day, 80 days to recoup investment}} \\]"
