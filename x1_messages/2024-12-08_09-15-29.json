        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the man buys 6 apples for $1.50. First, I need to find out how much each apple costs him.\n\nHe buys 6 apples for $1.50, so the cost per apple is $1.50 divided by 6, which is $0.25 per apple.\n\nNow, he sells half of his apples to another person for $0.60 per apple. Half of 6 is 3, so he sells 3 apples.\n\nHe sells each of these 3 apples for $0.60, so the total revenue from selling them is 3 apples times $0.60 per apple, which is $1.80.\n\nTo find his profit, I need to subtract his cost from his revenue.\n\nHis cost for the 3 apples he sold is 3 apples times $0.25 per apple, which is $0.75.\n\nSo, his profit is $1.80 (revenue) minus $0.75 (cost), which equals $1.05.\n\nTherefore, he made a profit of $1.05 from selling those apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.05} \\]"
