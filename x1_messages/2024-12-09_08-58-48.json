The equation given is:\n\n5(2x - 4) = 10(x - 6)\n\nFirst, I'll distribute the 5 on the left side and the 10 on the right side.\n\nSo, 5 times 2x is 10x, and 5 times -4 is -20. On the right side, 10 times x is 10x, and 10 times -6 is -60.\n\nSo now the equation looks like this:\n\n10x - 20 = 10x - 60\n\nNext, I'll try to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other side.\n\nIf I subtract 10x from both sides, I get:\n\n10x - 20 - 10x = 10x - 60 - 10x\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-20 = -60\n\nWait, that can't be right. -20 is not equal to -60.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nI distributed the 5 and the 10 correctly, I think.\n\nSo, 5(2x - 4) is indeed 10x - 20, and 10(x - 6) is indeed 10x - 60.\n\nThen, when I subtract 10x from both sides, I get -20 = -60, which is not true.\n\nThis means there is no solution to this equation, because it's impossible for -20 to equal -60.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation has no solution, which is fine.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that there is no solution to this equation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{no solution}} \\]"
