        "content": "So, the store has these packs of pencils, and each pack contains 12 pencils. They've got a total of 10,000 pencils. The question is, how many full packs can they make, and how many pencils will be left unpacked?\n\nAlright, to figure this out, I need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each pack. So, that's 10,000 divided by 12.\n\nLet me do the division step by step. First, 12 times 800 is 9,600. Because 12 times 100 is 1,200, so 12 times 800 is 9,600.\n\nNow, subtract 9,600 from 10,000, which gives me 400.\n\nNext, 12 times 33 is 396. Because 12 times 30 is 360, and 12 times 3 is 36, so 360 plus 36 is 396.\n\nSubtract 396 from 400, which leaves me with 4.\n\nSo, overall, 12 times 833 is 9,996, and there are 4 pencils left over.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 12 times 833 is indeed 9,996, because 12 times 800 is 9,600, and 12 times 33 is 396, so 9,600 plus 396 is 9,996.\n\nThen, 10,000 minus 9,996 is 4.\n\nTherefore, they can make 833 full packs, and there will be 4 pencils left unpacked.\n\nAlternatively, I could use long division for 10,000 divided by 12.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n12 divided into 10,000.\n\n12 goes into 100 (the first three digits) 8 times, because 12 times 8 is 96.\n\nSubtract 96 from 100, which leaves 4.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 40.\n\n12 goes into 40 three times, because 12 times 3 is 36.\n\nSubtract 36 from 40, which leaves 4.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 40 again.\n\n12 goes into 40 three times again, so 3.\n\n12 times 3 is 36, subtract from 40, leaves 4.\n\nSo, the quotient is 833 with a remainder of 4.\n\nTherefore, 833 full packs, and 4 pencils left unpacked.\n\nWait, but 12 times 833 is 9,996, and 10,000 minus 9,996 is indeed 4.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another method.\n\nLet me try using multiplication.\n\nIf they make 833 packs, each containing 12 pencils, that's 833 times 12.\n\n833 times 12 is calculated as follows:\n\n800 times 12 is 9,600.\n\n30 times 12 is 360.\n\n3 times 12 is 36.\n\nAdding those up: 9,600 plus 360 is 9,960, plus 36 is 9,996.\n\nSo, 833 packs account for 9,996 pencils.\n\nTotal pencils are 10,000, so 10,000 minus 9,996 is 4 pencils left unpacked.\n\nAlternatively, if they made one more pack, that would be 834 packs, totaling 12 times 834 is 9,996 plus 12, which is 10,008, which is more than 10,000, so they can't make another full pack.\n\nTherefore, 833 full packs and 4 pencils left unpacked.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use division with decimals.\n\n10,000 divided by 12 is approximately 833.333...\n\nThe integer part is 833, which represents the full packs, and the decimal part represents the fraction of a pack that can't be made.\n\nTo find out how many pencils that fraction corresponds to, multiply 0.333... by 12, which is approximately 4 pencils.\n\nSo, again, 833 full packs and 4 pencils left unpacked.\n\nAlternatively, using the modulo operation, 10,000 modulo 12 gives the remainder, which is 4.\n\nSo, all these methods confirm the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the store can make 833 full packs of pencils, and there will be 4 pencils left unpacked.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{833 \\text{ full packs and } 4 \\text{ pencils left unpacked}} \\]"
