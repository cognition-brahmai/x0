        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 8 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 4 green balls. And the question is, what's the probability of drawing either a red ball or a blue ball without looking?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls in the bag. So, if there are 8 red, 6 blue, and 4 green, I can add those up to find the total.\n\n8 + 6 + 4 = 18 balls in total.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing either a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the number of red balls is 8, and the number of blue balls is 6. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 8 + 6 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of drawing a red or blue ball is P = 14 / 18.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2, which gives P = 7 / 9.\n\nSo, the probability is 7/9.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can think about it another way. The probability of drawing a red ball is 8/18, and the probability of drawing a blue ball is 6/18. Since these are mutually exclusive events (you can't draw a ball that's both red and blue at the same time), I can add the probabilities together.\n\nSo, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue) = 8/18 + 6/18 = 14/18 = 7/9.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not drawing a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green balls is 4, so the probability of drawing a green ball is 4/18.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not drawing a green ball is 1 - 4/18 = 14/18 = 7/9.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 7/9 is the correct probability of drawing either a red or a blue ball from the bag.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{9}} \\]"
