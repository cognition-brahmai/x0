        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular garden that's 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, and I need to find out what the area is in square yards. Okay, first things first, I know that area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, in this case, it would be 40 feet times 20 feet. That gives me 800 square feet. But the question wants the answer in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards.\n\nI remember that 1 yard equals 3 feet, but since we're dealing with area, it's square yards and square feet. So, I think I need to square the conversion factor. That means 1 square yard equals 3 feet times 3 feet, which is 9 square feet. So, to convert from square feet to square yards, I should divide the number of square feet by 9.\n\nLet me double-check that. If 1 square yard is 9 square feet, then dividing by 9 should give me the number of square yards. Yeah, that makes sense. So, taking the 800 square feet and dividing by 9 should give me the area in square yards.\n\nLet's do the math: 800 divided by 9. Well, 9 times 88 is 792, which is less than 800. 9 times 89 is 801, which is over 800. So, 88 and 8/9 square yards. Maybe I can express it as a decimal for more precision. 800 divided by 9 is approximately 88.888... square yards. Maybe I can round it to two decimal places, so 88.89 square yards.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can convert the measurements to yards before multiplying. So, first convert the length and width from feet to yards.\n\nSince 1 yard is 3 feet, the length of 40 feet is equal to 40 divided by 3 yards, which is approximately 13.333 yards. Similarly, the width of 20 feet is equal to 20 divided by 3 yards, which is approximately 6.666 yards.\n\nNow, multiply these two to get the area in square yards: 13.333 yards times 6.666 yards. If I multiply these, I should get roughly the same result as before.\n\nLet me calculate that: 13.333 times 6 is 79.998, and 13.333 times 0.666 is approximately 8.888. Adding those together gives me approximately 88.888 square yards, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the area of the garden is approximately 88.89 square yards.\n\nWait a minute, but in the first method, I got 88.888... square yards, and in the second method, also 88.888... But when I did the division, I got 88.888..., but I'm wondering if there's a more exact way to express this.\n\nLet me see: 800 divided by 9 is exactly 88 and 8/9 square yards. So, maybe it's better to express it as a fraction instead of a decimal. 88 and 8/9 square yards is exact, whereas 88.89 is a rounded decimal.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in decimal form, then 88.89 is acceptable.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"What is the area of the garden in square yards?\" It doesn't specify whether to use fractions or decimals, so either should be fine. But perhaps using the exact fraction is better.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, square yards are often expressed in decimals, especially in measurements for gardening or flooring, where precise decimals are used for ordering materials.\n\nOn the other hand, in mathematical problems, exact fractions are preferred.\n\nHmm, I think I'll provide both answers: 88 and 8/9 square yards, which is approximately 88.89 square yards.\n\nBut to make sure, let me verify the initial calculations once more.\n\nFirst method:\n\nArea in square feet: 40 ft * 20 ft = 800 sq ft\n\nConversion to square yards: 800 sq ft / 9 = 88.888... sq yd, or 88 and 8/9 sq yd\n\nSecond method:\n\nConvert feet to yards first:\n\nLength: 40 ft / 3 = 13.333... yd\n\nWidth: 20 ft / 3 = 6.666... yd\n\nArea: 13.333... yd * 6.666... yd = 88.888... sq yd, or 88 and 8/9 sq yd\n\nBoth methods confirm the same result.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the area of the garden is 88 and 8/9 square yards, or approximately 88.89 square yards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{88.\\overline{8} \\text{ square yards} \\text{ or } 88 \\frac{8}{9} \\text{ square yards}} \\]"
