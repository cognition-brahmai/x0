For each step in your plan, assign an evidence value that corresponds to the output of one of the available functions. The input string for these functions can be the user question, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Allows users to search for information via DuckDuckGo. Useful for finding websites and articles pertinent to the user's query.\nInfoExtractor[input]: Pulls out crucial details from a block of text. Input must be a simple text passage.\nLinkGatherer[input]: Gathers links from a set of sites. Input must be a plain text, newline separated list of links.\nQAModel[input]: Language model capable of answering queries based on an input text. The input needs to be a textual question referencing a :evidence[n]: variable, such as What is the dog's breed, given :evidence1:?\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action, considering the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Subsequent function to call and its input parameter, potentially referring to earlier evidence like \"Considering context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final solution.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the director of the movie 'Inception' and what other movies have they directed?"
