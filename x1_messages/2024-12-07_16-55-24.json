        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a jar with 6 red marbles and 4 blue marbles, making a total of 10 marbles. The question is, if you draw two marbles at random without replacement, what's the probability that both marbles are red?\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to remember how probability works. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is drawing two red marbles. So, I need to find out how many ways I can draw two red marbles and divide that by the total number of ways I can draw any two marbles from the jar.\n\nLet me think about the total number of ways to draw two marbles from 10. That sounds like a combination problem because the order doesn't matter; I'm just choosing two marbles without regard to order.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 10 is:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\times 8!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 8! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 45 possible ways to draw two marbles from the jar.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to draw two red marbles. There are 6 red marbles, so the number of ways to choose 2 red marbles from 6 is:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 4!}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I can simplify by canceling out the \\( 4! \\):\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to draw two red marbles.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of sequential probabilities. Since the drawing is without replacement, the probability changes after the first marble is drawn.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first red}) = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that the first marble was red, there are now 5 red marbles left and a total of 9 marbles left in the jar. So, the probability of drawing a second red marble is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I multiply the probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{first red}) \\times P(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result. So, the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Suppose I list all possible pairs of marbles and count how many of them are both red.\n\nTotal marbles: 10\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 marbles: 45\n\nNumber of red marbles: 6\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 red marbles: 15\n\nSo, again, \\( \\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not drawing any blue marbles. But that seems more complicated for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, using permutations instead of combinations. But since the order doesn't matter here, combinations are the way to go.\n\nWait, but in the sequential approach, order does matter because you're considering the first and second draw. However, since it's without replacement, the probabilities adjust accordingly.\n\nBut both methods gave me the same answer, so I think \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) is correct.\n\nLet me see if there's a general formula for this kind of problem. It's similar to hypergeometric distribution, where you're sampling without replacement from a finite population.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (10 marbles)\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (6 red marbles)\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (2 marbles)\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (2 red marbles)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\frac{C(6, 2) \\times C(4, 0)}{C(10, 2)} = \\frac{15 \\times 1}{45} = \\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, I'm confident that \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) is the correct probability that both marbles drawn are red.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
