        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field that's currently 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. The farmer wants to increase the area by 50%, but he can only extend one side of the rectangle. We need to figure out which side he should extend and by how much.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current area of the field. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in the given dimensions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Area} = 120 \\, \\text{m} \\times 80 \\, \\text{m} = 9600 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, the farmer wants to increase this area by 50%. To find the new area, we can calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in Area} = 50\\% \\, \\text{of} \\, 9600 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 0.5 \\times 9600 = 4800 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the new area should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = \\text{Current Area} + \\text{Increase in Area} = 9600 \\, \\text{m}^2 + 4800 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 14400 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the new area needs to be 14400 square meters, and the farmer can only extend one side of the rectangle. We need to decide whether to extend the length or the width to achieve this new area.\n\nLet's consider both options separately.\n\n**Option 1: Extend the length**\n\nIf we extend the length, the width remains the same at 80 meters. Let\u2019s denote the new length as \\( L \\). The new area would then be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = L \\times 80 \\, \\text{m} = 14400 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( L \\):\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{14400 \\, \\text{m}^2}{80 \\, \\text{m}} = 180 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the length needs to be extended by:\n\n\\[\n180 \\, \\text{m} - 120 \\, \\text{m} = 60 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n**Option 2: Extend the width**\n\nAlternatively, if we extend the width, the length remains the same at 120 meters. Let\u2019s denote the new width as \\( W \\). The new area would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 120 \\, \\text{m} \\times W = 14400 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( W \\):\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{14400 \\, \\text{m}^2}{120 \\, \\text{m}} = 120 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the width needs to be extended by:\n\n\\[\n120 \\, \\text{m} - 80 \\, \\text{m} = 40 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two options:\n\n- Extend the length by 60 meters.\n\n- Extend the width by 40 meters.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any constraints on which side to extend or any costs associated with extending either side. Therefore, both options are mathematically valid.\n\nHowever, if we consider practical aspects, such as the availability of land or possibly lower costs for extending one side over the other, the farmer might choose one option over the other. But based solely on the information provided, either option will achieve the desired 50% increase in area.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Extend the length from 120 meters to 180 meters (an increase of 60 meters).\n\n- Or extend the width from 80 meters to 120 meters (an increase of 40 meters).\n\nBoth options will result in a new area of 14400 square meters, which is a 50% increase from the original area of 9600 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Extend the width by } 40 \\text{ meters or the length by } 60 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
