        "content": "To find the volume of water that a circular swimming pool can hold, we need to calculate the volume of a cylinder, since a swimming pool is essentially a cylindrical shape. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n- \\( h \\) is the height (or depth, in this case),\n- \\( \\pi \\) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the pool is 20 meters, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{20 \\, \\text{m}}{2} = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThe depth (height) of the water is given as 2 meters, so \\( h = 2 \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\nNow, plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = 3.14 \\times (10 \\, \\text{m})^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the square of the radius:\n\n\\[ (10 \\, \\text{m})^2 = 100 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 3.14 \\times 100 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 314 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by the height:\n\n\\[ 314 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{m} = 628 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the approximate volume of water the pool can hold is 628 cubic meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{628 \\, \\text{m}^3} \\]"
