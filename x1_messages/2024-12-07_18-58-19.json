        "content": "So, I have this question here: \"An average adult breathes around 16 times per minute. How many times does an average adult breathe in a week? Explain your steps.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to find out how many breaths an average adult takes in a week, given that they breathe 16 times per minute. To do this, I need to calculate the total number of minutes in a week and then multiply that by the breathing rate.\n\nFirst, I know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, if someone breathes 16 times per minute, then in one hour, they would breathe:\n\n16 breaths/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 960 breaths/hour\n\nNext, there are 24 hours in a day. So, in one day, the total number of breaths would be:\n\n960 breaths/hour * 24 hours/day = 23,040 breaths/day\n\nNow, there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, in one week, the total number of breaths would be:\n\n23,040 breaths/day * 7 days/week = 161,280 breaths/week\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- 16 breaths per minute\n\n- 60 minutes in an hour: 16 * 60 = 960 breaths per hour\n\n- 24 hours in a day: 960 * 24 = 23,040 breaths per day\n\n- 7 days in a week: 23,040 * 7 = 161,280 breaths per week\n\nHmm, that checks out. But maybe I should consider whether breathing rate stays constant throughout the day. I mean, when we sleep, our breathing rate might decrease, and during physical activity, it might increase. But the question says \"average adult,\" so I think it's safe to assume an average breathing rate over the entire day.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any other factors that could affect the breathing rate, like illness or high altitude, but again, since it's asking for an average, I think the given rate is sufficient.\n\nSo, my final answer is 161,280 breaths per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{161280} \\]"
