        "content": "Let's see. The factory currently produces 250 units per hour, and they want to increase that by 20%. So, I need to find out what 20% of 250 is and then add that to the original 250 units.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate 20% of 250. Percentage means per hundred, so 20% is the same as 20/100 or 0.20. Multiplying 250 by 0.20 should give me the increase in units.\n\n250 \u00d7 0.20 = 50 units.\n\nSo, the production is increasing by 50 units per hour. Now, I'll add that to the original production amount.\n\n250 + 50 = 300 units.\n\nTherefore, after the increase, the factory will produce 300 units per hour.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this? Maybe by finding what 120% of the original production is, since they're increasing by 20%.\n\nLet me try that. 100% of the original production is 250 units, and they want to increase it by 20%, making it 120% of the original.\n\nSo, 120% of 250 is:\n\n120/100 \u00d7 250 = 1.2 \u00d7 250 = 300 units.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other factor I should consider. For example, is there any limitation on how much they can increase production? The question doesn't mention any constraints, so I'll assume that the production can be increased by 20% without any issues.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the increase is indeed 20% and not 20 units. The question says \"20%\", so it's a percentage increase, not a fixed number increase.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the increase is per hour, per day, or per some other time period. The question specifies \"per hour,\" so that's what I should use.\n\nLet me just double-check the arithmetic to be sure.\n\nOriginal production: 250 units per hour.\n\nIncrease: 20% of 250 = 0.2 \u00d7 250 = 50 units.\n\nTotal production after increase: 250 + 50 = 300 units per hour.\n\nAlternatively, 120% of 250 = 1.2 \u00d7 250 = 300 units per hour.\n\nBoth methods confirm the same result.\n\nI think that's straightforward. The factory will produce 300 units per hour after increasing production by 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
