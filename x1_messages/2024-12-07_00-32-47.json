The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\]\n\nGiven that the length of the garden is 25 meters and the width is 15 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (25 + 15) = 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, you will need 80 meters of fencing to enclose the entire garden."
