        "content": "To express the complex number 3 + 4i in polar form, we need to find its magnitude (or modulus) and its argument (or angle). The polar form of a complex number is given by r(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8), where r is the magnitude and \u03b8 is the argument.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude r. The magnitude of a complex number a + bi is given by sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Here, a = 3 and b = 4.\n\nr = sqrt(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the argument \u03b8. The argument is the angle that the complex number makes with the positive real axis. It can be found using the arctangent function, \u03b8 = arctan(b/a).\n\n\u03b8 = arctan(4/3) \u2248 53.13 degrees.\n\nHowever, in radians, this is approximately 0.93 radians.\n\nTherefore, the polar form of the complex number 3 + 4i is 5(cos(0.93) + isin(0.93)).\n\nAlternatively, it can be written as 5cis(0.93), where cis is shorthand for cos + i sin.\n\nSo, 3 + 4i in polar form is 5cis(0.93).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5\\left(\\cos 0.93 + i\\sin 0.93\\right)} \\]"
