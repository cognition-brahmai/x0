        "content": "Let's see here. There are 30 students in the class. Out of these, 18 play soccer and 12 play basketball. The problem also states that every student plays at least one sport, and no student plays both sports. So, I need to find out how many students play neither sport.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says that every student plays at least one sport, which means that all students play either soccer or basketball, but not both, since no student plays both sports.\n\nSo, if there are 18 students playing soccer and 12 playing basketball, and no overlap between the two, the total number of students playing a sport would be 18 + 12 = 30.\n\nSince there are 30 students in the class and all 30 are accounted for by those playing soccer or basketball, that means there are no students left who play neither sport.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play neither soccer nor basketball is 0.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If there are 18 soccer players and 12 basketball players, and no one plays both, then the total number of students involved in a sport is indeed 30. Since the class has 30 students, and all of them are playing a sport, the number playing neither should be zero.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
