        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 4 + 6 + 5, which is 15 balls.\n\nThe question is about finding the probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball when three balls are drawn at once without replacement. Okay, so it's without replacement, which means once a ball is drawn, it doesn't go back into the bag.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when drawing three balls from 15. Since the order doesn't matter here, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 15 is C(15, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3! * (15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nSo, there are 455 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 15.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are 4 red balls, and I need to choose 2 of them. So, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 4 is C(4, 2).\n\nC(4, 2) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 6.\n\nSimilarly, there are 6 blue balls, and I need to choose 1 of them. So, the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball from 6 is C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these two combinations: 6 (for red) \u00d7 6 (for blue) = 36.\n\nWait a minute, but I think I should consider that I'm drawing all three balls at once, so I shouldn't separate them like this. Maybe I need to use multivariate hypergeometric distribution.\n\nLet me recall: The hypergeometric distribution is used when we're sampling without replacement, and we want to find the probability of a certain number of successes in a certain number of draws.\n\nIn this case, I have three categories: red, blue, and green balls. I want 2 red and 1 blue, so no green balls in this draw.\n\nThe formula for the multivariate hypergeometric distribution is:\n\nP = [C(K, k) * C(M, m) * C(N, n)] / C(T, t)\n\nwhere:\n\n- K is the number of one type of item,\n\n- M is another type,\n\n- N is the remaining type,\n\n- T is the total number of items,\n\n- k, m, n are the numbers of each type drawn,\n\n- t is the total number drawn.\n\nIn my problem:\n\n- K (red) = 4, k (red to be drawn) = 2\n\n- M (blue) = 6, m (blue to be drawn) = 1\n\n- N (green) = 5, n (green to be drawn) = 0\n\n- T (total) = 15, t (total drawn) = 3\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\nP = [C(4, 2) * C(6, 1) * C(5, 0)] / C(15, 3)\n\nI already know C(15, 3) = 455.\n\nNow, C(4, 2) = 6, as I calculated earlier.\n\nC(6, 1) = 6.\n\nC(5, 0) = 1, because there's only one way to choose zero items from five.\n\nSo, the numerator is 6 * 6 * 1 = 36.\n\nTherefore, P = 36 / 455.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction. Both 36 and 455 are divisible by... let's see, 36 divided by 9 is 4, 455 divided by 9 is not an integer. Divisible by 3? 36 \u00f7 3 = 12, 455 \u00f7 3 is not an integer. Divisible by 2? 36 \u00f7 2 = 18, 455 \u00f7 2 is not an integer. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 36/455.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can calculate it using another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: think about the probability of drawing two reds and one blue in a specific order, and then consider all possible orders.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red ball first: 4 red out of 15 total, so 4/15.\n\nThen, without replacement, there are now 14 balls left, with 3 red remaining. So, the probability of drawing another red: 3/14.\n\nThen, drawing a blue ball: there are 6 blue balls out of the remaining 13 balls, so 6/13.\n\nSo, the probability for the order red, red, blue is (4/15) * (3/14) * (6/13).\n\nBut the balls are drawn at once, so the order doesn't matter. There are other orders in which we can draw 2 reds and 1 blue: red, blue, red; blue, red, red.\n\nSo, there are 3 different sequences: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nEach of these has the same probability: (4/15)*(3/14)*(6/13).\n\nSo, total probability is 3 * [(4*3*6)/(15*14*13)].\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nNumerator: 4*3*6 = 72.\n\nDenominator: 15*14*13 = 2730.\n\nSo, P = 3 * (72 / 2730) = (216 / 2730).\n\nSimplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 6. 216 \u00f7 6 = 36, 2730 \u00f7 6 = 455. So, P = 36/455.\n\nSame as before. Good, it matches.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought in terms of combinations all along. The number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 4 is C(4,2)=6, and 1 blue ball from 6 is C(6,1)=6, and total ways to choose any 3 balls from 15 is C(15,3)=455. So, probability is (6*6)/455 = 36/455.\n\nYeah, that's consistent.\n\nI think 36/455 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I think about it step by step, considering the balls are drawn one by one without replacement.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is 4/15.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, the probability of drawing another red is 3/14.\n\nThen, given that the first two were red, the probability of drawing a blue is 6/13.\n\nSo, the probability for that specific sequence is (4/15)*(3/14)*(6/13).\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible sequences where there are two reds and one blue.\n\nAs I did earlier, there are three such sequences: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nSo, total probability is 3*(4/15*3/14*6/13) = 3*(72/2730) = 216/2730 = 36/455.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it using permutations.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw 3 balls from 15 is P(15,3) = 15*14*13 = 2730.\n\nNumber of ways to draw 2 red and 1 blue: first, choose 2 reds from 4, which is C(4,2)=6, and 1 blue from 6, which is C(6,1)=6, and then arrange these 3 balls in all possible orders, which is 3! = 6.\n\nSo, total number of favorable permutations is 6*6*6 = 216.\n\nTherefore, probability is 216/2730 = 36/455.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball when three balls are drawn at once without replacement is 36/455.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{36}{455}} \\]"
