        "content": "To find out how many gallons of water the cylindrical tank can hold, I need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the cylinder in cubic feet.\n2. Convert that volume into gallons using the given conversion rate.\n\nFirst, the formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the cylinder,\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the diameter is 10 feet, the radius \\( r \\) is half of that, which is 5 feet. The height \\( h \\) is 15 feet.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times (5)^2 \\times 15 \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 25 \\times 15 \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 375 \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 3.1416 \\times 375 \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 1178.097 \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, convert cubic feet to gallons. We're told that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons.\n\nSo, the total gallons \\( G \\) is:\n\n\\[ G = V \\times 7.48 \\]\n\n\\[ G \\approx 1178.097 \\times 7.48 \\]\n\n\\[ G \\approx 8812.169 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the tank can hold approximately 8812.17 gallons of water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8812.17} \\]"
