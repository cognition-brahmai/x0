Each step in the plan will yield an evidence value that represents the output of one of the accessible functions. The inputs to these functions could either be the user's question, preceding evidence values, or a blend of both.\n\nTools Available:\nYahooSearch[input]: Allows the user to conduct searches via the Yahoo search engine. This tool generates a list of potential websites that may hold the answer to the user's inquiry.\nSiteScanner[input]: Fetches one or more websites from the input string, which contains newline-separated links. Produces a plain-text output comprising the contents of the links.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Gleans hyperlinks from plain text and delivers a plain-text, newline-separated list of links.\nAIQA[input]: Artificial Intelligence Question-Answering model adept at responding to queries based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a textual question that refers to a #E[index] variable (e.g., What is the population of New York City, given #E1?)\n\nOutput Format:\nPlan: [First action derived from the user's question]\n#E0 = [Function to invoke with its input]\nPlan: [Following action, based on the outcome of #E0]\n#E1 = [Subsequent function to invoke with its input, possibly referring to earlier evidence (e.g., \"Given context #E0\")]\n...\nAnswer: [#E[n] containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and what other books have they written?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and what other books they've written. I think the best way to start is by searching for the book online to get some information about its author. I have a tool called YahooSearch that can help me with that. So, I'll use YahooSearch to look up 'To Kill a Mockingbird.'\n\nOnce I have the search results, I'll probably get a list of websites that talk about the book. I need to check those websites to find the author's name. For that, I can use SiteScanner to extract information from those websites. But first, I need to pick the most relevant websites from the search results.\n\nAfter finding the author's name, I need to find out what other books they've written. I can probably do another search for the author's name and look for their bibliography or list of works. Again, YahooSearch should be helpful here.\n\nOnce I have the list of books, I can compile that information and present it as the final answer.\n\nLet me outline this step by step:\n\n1. Use YahooSearch to search for 'To Kill a Mockingbird' to find websites that discuss the book.\n\n2. From the search results, select relevant websites and use SiteScanner to extract information from them.\n\n3. Look for the author's name in the scanned information.\n\n4. Use YahooSearch again to search for the author's name along with keywords like 'books' or 'bibliography' to find other works by the same author.\n\n5. Use SiteScanner again to extract information from the new set of websites.\n\n6. Compile a list of other books written by the same author.\n\n7. Present the author's name and the list of other books as the final answer.\n\nI need to make sure that each step depends on the previous one, and I use the evidence gathered to inform the next action.\n\nLet's think about how to structure this in terms of evidence values.\n\n- #E0: Output from YahooSearch for 'To Kill a Mockingbird'\n\n- #E1: Relevant websites selected from #E0\n\n- #E2: Information extracted from #E1 using SiteScanner\n\n- #E3: Author's name extracted from #E2\n\n- #E4: Output from YahooSearch for '#E3 books'\n\n- #E5: Relevant websites selected from #E4\n\n- #E6: Information extracted from #E5 using SiteScanner\n\n- #E7: List of other books by the author extracted from #E6\n\n- Final Answer: Author's name (#E3) and list of other books (#E7)\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that I'm selecting the relevant websites. Maybe I should use HyperlinkExtractor to get the links from the search results and then feed those links to SiteScanner.\n\nLet me adjust the plan:\n\n1. Use YahooSearch to search for 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.\n\n2. Use HyperlinkExtractor to get the URLs from the search results.\n\n3. Use SiteScanner to extract information from those URLs.\n\n4. Use AIQA to find the author's name from #E2.\n\n5. Use YahooSearch to search for '[author's name] books'.\n\n6. Use HyperlinkExtractor to get the URLs from this new search.\n\n7. Use SiteScanner to extract information from these new URLs.\n\n8. Use AIQA to find the list of other books by the author from #E6.\n\n9. Present the author's name and the list of other books.\n\nThis seems more systematic. Let me assign evidence values:\n\n- #E0: Output from YahooSearch for 'To Kill a Mockingbird'\n\n- #E1: URLs extracted from #E0 using HyperlinkExtractor\n\n- #E2: Information extracted from #E1 using SiteScanner\n\n- #E3: Author's name extracted from #E2 using AIQA\n\n- #E4: Output from YahooSearch for '#E3 books'\n\n- #E5: URLs extracted from #E4 using HyperlinkExtractor\n\n- #E6: Information extracted from #E5 using SiteScanner\n\n- #E7: List of other books by the author extracted from #E6 using AIQA\n\n- Final Answer: Author's name (#E3) and list of other books (#E7)\n\nI think this covers everything. Now, I need to make sure that each tool is used appropriately and that the inputs are correctly referenced.\n\nLet me write this plan step by step:\n\nPlan: Search for 'To Kill a Mockingbird' to find information about the book.\n\n#E0 = YahooSearch['To Kill a Mockingbird']\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the search results for further investigation.\n\n#E1 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E0]\n\nPlan: Scan the extracted websites to gather information about the book.\n\n#E2 = SiteScanner[#E1]\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to identify the author's name from the scanned information.\n\n#E3 = AIQA['Who is the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", given #E2?']\n\nPlan: Search for other books by the same author.\n\n#E4 = YahooSearch[#E3 + ' books']\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the new search results.\n\n#E5 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E4]\n\nPlan: Scan these websites to find information about the author's other works.\n\n#E6 = SiteScanner[#E5]\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to extract the list of other books written by the author.\n\n#E7 = AIQA['What other books has ' + #E3 + ' written, given #E6?']\n\nAnswer: The author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is #E3, and their other books include #E7.\n\nThis should give me the information I need. I just need to make sure that each tool is used correctly and that the references to previous evidence are accurate.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo provide an optimal response to the user's command, we need to identify the author of the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and list other books written by the same author. We will achieve this through a systematic plan utilizing available tools: YahooSearch, SiteScanner, HyperlinkExtractor, and AIQA. \n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Search for the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' to find\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f about it.**\n   - Use YahooSearch to obtain a list of potential websites that may hold the answer to the user's inquiry.\n   - **Evidence:** #E0 = YahooSearch['To Kill a Mockingbird']\n\n2. **Extract URLs from the search results for further investigation.**\n   - Use HyperlinkExtractor to glean hyperlinks from the search results.\n   - **Evidence:** #E1 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E0]\n\n3. **Scan the extracted websites to gather information about the book.**\n   - Use SiteScanner to fetch and convert the content of the websites into plain text.\n   - **Evidence:** #E2 = SiteScanner[#E1]\n\n4. **Use AIQA to identify the author's name from the scanned information.**\n   - Pose a question to AIQA to extract the author's name from the text obtained in #E2.\n   - **Evidence:** #E3 = AIQA['Who is the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", given #E2?']\n\n5. **Search for other books by the same author.**\n   - Use YahooSearch to find information about other books written by the identified author.\n   - **Evidence:** #E4 = YahooSearch[#E3 + ' books']\n\n6. **Extract URLs from the new search results.**\n   - Use HyperlinkExtractor to glean hyperlinks from the new search results.\n   - **Evidence:** #E5 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E4]\n\n7. **Scan these websites to find information about the author's other works.**\n   - Use SiteScanner to fetch and convert the content of these websites into plain text.\n   - **Evidence:** #E6 = SiteScanner[#E5]\n\n8. **Use AIQA to extract the list of other books written by the author.**\n   - Pose a question to AIQA to identify other books written by the author from the text obtained in #E6.\n   - **Evidence:** #E7 = AIQA['What other books has ' + #E3 + ' written, given #E6?']\n\n9. **Present the final answer.**\n   - Combine the author's name and the list of other books into the final response.\n   - **Answer:** The author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is #E3, and their other books include #E7.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\nPlan: Search for 'To Kill a Mockingbird' to find information about the book.\n#E0 = YahooSearch['To Kill a Mockingbird']\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the search results for further investigation.\n#E1 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E0]\n\nPlan: Scan the extracted websites to gather information about the book.\n#E2 = SiteScanner[#E1]\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to identify the author's name from the scanned information.\n#E3 = AIQA['Who is the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", given #E2?']\n\nPlan: Search for other books by the same author.\n#E4 = YahooSearch[#E3 + ' books']\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the new search results.\n#E5 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E4]\n\nPlan: Scan these websites to find information about the author's other works.\n#E6 = SiteScanner[#E5]\n\nPlan: Use AIQA to extract the list of other books written by the author.\n#E7 = AIQA['What other books has ' + #E3 + ' written, given #E6?']\n\nAnswer: The author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is #E3, and their other books include #E7.\n```\n\nThis plan ensures a methodical approach to gathering and synthesizing information from various sources to provide an accurate and comprehensive response to the user's question."
