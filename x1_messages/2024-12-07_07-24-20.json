        "content": "To calculate the gross profit margin percentage, I need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the gross profit per unit.\n2. Calculate the total gross profit.\n3. Determine the total revenue.\n4. Use the formula for gross profit margin percentage.\n\nFirst, the gross profit per unit is the selling price per unit minus the cost to produce per unit. So, that's $15 minus $7, which equals $8 per widget.\n\nNext, the total gross profit is the gross profit per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. So, $8 times 5,000 widgets equals $40,000.\n\nThen, the total revenue is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. That's $15 times 5,000, which equals $75,000.\n\nFinally, the gross profit margin percentage is the total gross profit divided by the total revenue, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. So, $40,000 divided by $75,000 equals approximately 0.5333, and multiplied by 100 that's about 53.33%.\n\nTherefore, the company's gross profit margin percentage is approximately 53.33%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{53.33\\%} \\]"
