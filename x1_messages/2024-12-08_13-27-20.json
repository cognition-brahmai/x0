        "content": "So there are 50 coins in a bag: 20 pennies, 15 nickels, 10 dimes, and 5 quarters. I need to find the probability of picking either a penny or a quarter without looking. Alright, probability is basically the chances of something happening divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many favorable outcomes there are. Favorable outcomes in this case mean picking either a penny or a quarter. There are 20 pennies and 5 quarters, so total favorable outcomes are 20 + 5 = 25.\n\nTotal possible outcomes are the total number of coins, which is 50.\n\nSo, probability should be favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, right? That would be 25 divided by 50, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Could I use the addition rule for probability here? The addition rule says that the probability of A or B is equal to the probability of A plus the probability of B minus the probability of both A and B happening together.\n\nIn this case, A is picking a penny, and B is picking a quarter. Since you can't pick both at the same time in a single draw, the probability of both A and B happening together is zero. So, it should just be the probability of A plus the probability of B.\n\nProbability of picking a penny is 20/50, which is 0.4.\n\nProbability of picking a quarter is 5/50, which is 0.1.\n\nSo, 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages. 20 pennies out of 50 is 40%, and 5 quarters out of 50 is 10%. So, 40% + 10% = 50%.\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance of overlap or some other factor I'm missing. But no, since all coins are distinct in type, and I'm only drawing one coin, there's no overlap.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the total number of coins adds up correctly: 20 pennies + 15 nickels + 10 dimes + 5 quarters = 50 coins. That checks out.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the probability is 25 out of 50, which is 1/2 or 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
