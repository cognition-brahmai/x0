        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to choose a committee of 4 people from a group of 12, but there's a catch\u2014two specific individuals can't be on the committee together. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of ways to choose a committee of 4 from 12 without any restrictions. That sounds like a combination problem, where order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for this case, n = 12 and k = 4. Plugging into the formula:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!) = (12!)/(4! * 8!) \n\nI can calculate 12! , but that's a big number. Maybe there's a simpler way. I know that 12! = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!, so the 8! in the denominator cancels out:\n\nC(12, 4) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (4! \u00d7 8!)= (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9)/4!\n\nNow, 4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nSo, C(12, 4) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9)/24\n\nLet me calculate the numerator: 12 \u00d7 11 = 132, times 10 is 1320, times 9 is 11880.\n\nNow, divide by 24: 11880 / 24.\n\nWell, 24 \u00d7 495 = 11880, so C(12, 4) = 495.\n\nSo, there are 495 ways to choose a committee of 4 from 12 without any restrictions.\n\nBut there's a condition: two specific individuals can't be on the committee together. Let's call these two people A and B. So, the committees where both A and B are selected are not allowed.\n\nI need to find the number of committees where A and B are both included, and then subtract that from the total number of committees.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of committees that include both A and B.\n\nIf both A and B are on the committee, then we're choosing 2 more people from the remaining 10 (since there are 12 total, minus A and B).\n\nSo, the number of committees with both A and B is C(10, 2), because we're choosing 2 people from the remaining 10.\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!) = (10!)/(2! * 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!)/(2! \u00d7 8!)= (10 \u00d7 9)/2! = 90/2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 committees where both A and B are included.\n\nNow, to find the number of committees where A and B are not both included, I subtract the number of committees with both A and B from the total number of committees.\n\nSo, total valid committees = total committees - committees with both A and B = 495 - 45 = 450.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the different scenarios:\n\n1. Committees that include A but not B.\n\n2. Committees that include B but not A.\n\n3. Committees that include neither A nor B.\n\nAnd then add these up.\n\nLet's calculate each of these.\n\n1. Committees that include A but not B:\n\n- We're choosing A, excluding B, and choosing 3 more people from the remaining 10 (since B is excluded).\n\n- So, number of such committees is C(10, 3).\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!)/(3! \u00d7 7!)= (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8)/6 = 720/6 = 120.\n\n2. Committees that include B but not A:\n\n- Similar to the above, choosing B, excluding A, and choosing 3 more from the remaining 10.\n\n- Again, C(10, 3) = 120.\n\n3. Committees that include neither A nor B:\n\n- Choosing all 4 people from the remaining 10.\n\n- So, C(10, 4).\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!)/(4! \u00d7 6!)= (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7)/24.\n\nCalculate numerator: 10 \u00d7 9 = 90, times 8 is 720, times 7 is 5040.\n\nDenominator is 24.\n\nSo, 5040 / 24 = 210.\n\nTherefore, total valid committees = 120 (A but not B) + 120 (B but not A) + 210 (neither A nor B) = 450.\n\nThis matches the previous result of 495 total committees minus 45 committees with both A and B, which equals 450.\n\nSo, the answer should be 450.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nTotal committees = C(12, 4) = 495.\n\nCommittees with both A and B = C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nSo, valid committees = total - invalid (both A and B) = 495 - 45 = 450.\n\nYes, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, another approach:\n\nImagine selecting the committee step by step.\n\nFirst, decide on A and B's inclusion.\n\nThere are four possibilities:\n\n1. Neither A nor B is on the committee.\n\n2. A is on the committee, B is not.\n\n3. B is on the committee, A is not.\n\n4. Both A and B are on the committee.\n\nBut the fourth option is not allowed, so we can't have both A and B together.\n\nSo, only the first three options are allowed.\n\nNow, the number of ways for each:\n\n1. Neither A nor B: C(10, 4) = 210.\n\n2. A but not B: C(10, 3) = 120.\n\n3. B but not A: C(10, 3) = 120.\n\nTotal: 210 + 120 + 120 = 450.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can calculate C(10, 3) and C(10, 4) again to confirm.\n\nC(10, 3) = 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 / 6 = 120.\n\nC(10, 4) = 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 / 24 = 210.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the total number of committees is C(12, 4) = 495, and the number of invalid committees is C(10, 2) = 45, then 495 - 45 = 450.\n\nThis seems to be a correct approach.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose a committee of 4 from 12, where two specific individuals can't be together, is 450.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]"
