        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the factory produces 100 units of product each day, and each unit costs $20 to make. First, I need to find out the daily production cost.\n\nDaily production cost would be the number of units produced per day multiplied by the cost per unit. So, that's 100 units/day * $20/unit = $2,000 per day.\n\nNow, the factory operates 25 days per month. So, the total variable production cost per month would be the daily production cost multiplied by the number of operating days in a month. That is $2,000/day * 25 days/month = $50,000 per month.\n\nBut, there are also fixed costs of $15,000 per month. Fixed costs are costs that don't change with the level of production, like rent or salaries.\n\nSo, to find the total monthly production cost, I need to add both the variable costs and the fixed costs together.\n\nTotal monthly production cost = variable costs + fixed costs = $50,000 + $15,000 = $65,000.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me double-check. The variable costs are based on daily production and the number of days operating per month, which seems correct. The fixed costs are given as $15,000 per month, so adding that to the variable costs should give the total production cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there are other costs involved that aren't being considered here, but based on the information provided, it seems like variable costs are only the production costs per unit, and the fixed costs are separate.\n\nSo, total monthly production cost should indeed be $65,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the total cost. For example, are there any overhead costs, labor costs, or material costs that aren't included in the $20 per unit? The question seems to indicate that the $20 per unit covers the cost to produce one unit, and the $15,000 is the fixed cost per month.\n\nAssuming that's all the information given, $65,000 should be the total monthly production cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed costs include other expenses, but the question specifies that there are fixed costs of $15,000 per month in addition to the production costs.\n\nWait, the production cost per unit is $20, and that's for variable costs, while fixed costs are separate.\n\nSo, yes, total monthly production cost is variable costs plus fixed costs, which is $50,000 + $15,000 = $65,000.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65000} \\]"
