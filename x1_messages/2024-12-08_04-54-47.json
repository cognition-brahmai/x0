        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to build a command-line tool in Golang that reads a CSV file with names and email addresses and then sends a personalized greeting email to each person using AWS SES. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up my development environment. I should make sure I have Go installed, and I probably need to install the AWS SDK for Go to interact with SES. Also, since I'm dealing with CSV files, I'll need to use Go's standard library for that.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tool. It should accept a CSV file as input, so I need to handle command-line arguments to specify the file path. Then, read the CSV file, parse the names and email addresses, and for each entry, construct and send an email using SES.\n\nI should also consider error handling. What if the CSV file doesn't exist or is malformed? What if there are issues with sending emails through SES, like rate limits or invalid credentials?\n\nAlright, starting with setting up the Go environment. I'll make sure I have Go installed and set up a new Go module for this project.\n\nNext, I need to install the AWS SDK for Go. I can do this using Go modules by adding it as a dependency. The command would be something like `go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws` and `go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/ses`.\n\nNow, for reading the CSV file, Go has the `encoding/csv` package in its standard library, which I can use to read and parse the CSV data.\n\nI need to decide on the format of the CSV file. Let's assume it has two columns: Name and Email. I should also handle any headers in the CSV file, but for simplicity, I'll assume the first row contains headers and skip it.\n\nSo, in code, I'll open the file using `os.Open`, then create a `csv.Reader` to read the file. I'll read the header row first and then iterate over the remaining rows to get the name and email.\n\nFor sending emails via SES, I need to configure the AWS SDK with my AWS credentials and region. Then, I can use the SES `SendEmail` or `SendRawEmail` method to send the emails.\n\nI need to construct the email content. It should be a personalized greeting, so probably something like \"Hello [Name], welcome!\" in the body of the email.\n\nI should also set the subject of the email, maybe \"Welcome!\" or something similar.\n\nLet me think about how to make this tool more flexible. Maybe allow the user to specify the subject and the body template via command-line flags. That way, they can customize the email content without changing the code.\n\nYes, that's a good idea. I'll use the `flag` package in Go to handle command-line options. So, I'll have flags for the CSV file path, subject, and body template.\n\nFor the body template, I'll need to replace a placeholder with the actual name. For example, in the template, I can have `{name}` and replace it with the name from the CSV.\n\nSo, in code, I'll read the body template, and for each recipient, replace `{name}` with their name.\n\nI should also handle any special characters or formatting in the email body, maybe support HTML emails.\n\nHmm, maybe I'll add an option to specify whether the email body is plain text or HTML.\n\nAlright, so I'll add another flag for the email format, with options like \"text\" or \"html\".\n\nNow, regarding AWS SES, I need to make sure that the sender email is verified in SES, and if the recipient emails need to be verified depending on the SES sandbox mode.\n\nI should include some error handling to check if the sender email is verified and handle any SES-specific errors.\n\nAlso, SES has sending limits, especially in the sandbox mode. I need to handle rate limits and throttle my requests if necessary.\n\nMaybe I'll add some logging to show which emails have been sent successfully and which have failed.\n\nFor logging, I can use Go's `log` package.\n\nAlright, let's outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Parse command-line flags for CSV file path, subject, body template, email format, and any other options.\n\n2. Read the CSV file and parse the names and email addresses, skipping the header row.\n\n3. Configure the AWS SDK with credentials and region.\n\n4. For each recipient:\n\na. Replace placeholders in the body template with the recipient's name.\n\nb. Construct the email using SES's `SendEmail` API, specifying the source, destination, subject, and body (text or HTML).\n\nc. Handle any errors returned by SES and log the result.\n\n5. Log the total number of emails sent and any failures.\n\nI should also consider concurrency. If there are many recipients, sending emails one by one might take too long. Maybe I can send emails in parallel using Go routines and a work queue.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll start with sending emails sequentially and see if that meets the requirements.\n\nSecurity is also a concern. I need to make sure that the AWS credentials are handled securely, perhaps by using environment variables or AWS config files.\n\nAlso, I should avoid logging or exposing any email content or credentials in the logs.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Let me start by writing some pseudocode to outline the structure.\n\nPseudocode:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\n \"encoding/csv\"\n\n \"flag\"\n\n \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws\"\n\n \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session\"\n\n \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/ses\"\n\n \"log\"\n\n \"os\"\n\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n // Define command-line flags\n\n csvFile := flag.String(\"csv\", \"\", \"Path to the CSV file\")\n\n subject := flag.String(\"subject\", \"Welcome!\", \"Email subject\")\n\n bodyTemplate := flag.String(\"body\", \"Hello {name}, welcome!\", \"Email body template\")\n\n emailFormat := flag.String(\"format\", \"text\", \"Email format: text or html\")\n\n flag.Parse()\n\n if *csvFile == \"\" {\n\n log.Fatal(\"CSV file path is required.\")\n\n }\n\n // Open and read the CSV file\n\n file, err := os.Open(*csvFile)\n\n if err != nil {\n\n log.Fatalf(\"Error opening CSV file: %v\", err)\n\n }\n\n defer file.Close()\n\n reader := csv.NewReader(file)\n\n // Read header and skip it\n\n _, err = reader.Read()\n\n if err != nil {\n\n log.Fatalf(\"Error reading header: %v\", err)\n\n }\n\n // Read all rows\n\n records, err := reader.ReadAll()\n\n if err != nil {\n\n log.Fatalf(\"Error reading CSV records: %v\", err)\n\n }\n\n // Configure AWS SES\n\n sess, err := session.NewSession(&aws.Config{\n\n Region: aws.String(\"us-west-2\")), // or appropriate region\n\n })\n\n if err != nil {\n\n log.Fatalf(\"Error creating AWS session: %v\", err)\n\n }\n\n sesSvc := ses.New(sess)\n\n // Send emails\n\n for _, row := range records {\n\n name := row[0]\n\n email := row[1]\n\n body := replacePlaceholders(*bodyTemplate, name)\n\n input := &ses.SendEmailInput{\n\n Source: aws.String(\"sender@example.com\"),\n\n Destination: &ses.Destination{\n\n ToAddresses: aws.StringSlice([]string{email}),\n\n },\n\n Message: &ses.Message{\n\n Subject: &ses.Content{\n\n Data: aws.String(*subject),\n\n },\n\n Body: &ses.Body{\n\n Text: &ses.Content{\n\n Data: aws.String(body),\n\n },\n\n // If format is HTML, set Html as well\n\n },\n\n },\n\n }\n\n if *emailFormat == \"html\" {\n\n input.Message.Body.Html = &ses.Content{\n\n Data: aws.String(body),\n\n },\n\n }\n\n _, err := sesSvc.SendEmail(input)\n\n if err != nil {\n\n log.Printf(\"Error sending email to %s: %v\", email, err)\n\n } else {\n\n log.Printf(\"Email sent to %s\", email)\n\n }\n\n }\n\n}\n\nfunc replacePlaceholders(template, name string) string {\n\n return strings.Replace(template, \"{name}\", name, -1)\n\n}\n\nThis is a basic outline. I need to add more error handling and possibly options for better customization.\n\nI should also consider validating the email addresses to make sure they are in the correct format before attempting to send emails.\n\nMaybe I can use a regular expression to validate the email addresses in the CSV.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the CSV file has the correct number of columns. If a row has missing name or email, I should skip it or handle it gracefully.\n\nAlright, I think this is a good starting point. I'll proceed to implement this and test it step by step.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Golang command-line tool that reads a CSV file containing names and email addresses and sends a personalized greeting email to each recipient using AWS Simple Email Service (SES), follow these steps:\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"regexp\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\n\t\"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws\"\n\t\"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session\"\n\t\"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/ses\"\n\t\"github.com/pkg/errors\"\n\t\"gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2\"\n)\n\nvar (\n\tcsvFile    = kingpin.Flag(\"csv\", \"Path to the CSV file\").Required().String()\n\tsubject    = kingpin.Flag(\"subject\", \"Email subject\").Default(\"Welcome!\").String()\n\tbody       = kingpin.Flag(\"body\", \"Email body template\").Default(\"Hello {name}, welcome!\").String()\n\tformat     = kingpin.Flag(\"format\", \"Email format: text or html\").Default(\"text\").String()\n\tsender     = kingpin.Flag(\"sender\", \"Sender email address\").Required().String()\n\tregion     = kingpin.Flag(\"region\", \"AWS region\").Default(\"us-west-2\").String()\n\tdryRun     = kingpin.Flag(\"dry-run\", \"Perform a dry run without sending emails\").Default(\"false\").Bool()\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tkingpin.Version(\"1.0.0\")\n\tkingpin.Parse()\n\n\tfile, err := os.Open(*csvFile)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error opening CSV file: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\treader := csv.NewReader(file)\n\t_, err = reader.Read() // Skip header\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error reading header: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\trecords, err := reader.ReadAll()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error reading CSV records: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tsess, err := session.NewSession(&aws.Config{\n\t\tRegion: aws.String(*region),\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error creating AWS session: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tsesSvc := ses.New(sess)\n\n\tfor _, row := range records {\n\t\tif len(row) < 2 {\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Skipping row due to insufficient data: %v\", row)\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t}\n\t\tname := row[0]\n\t\temail := row[1]\n\t\tif !isValidEmail(email) {\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Invalid email address: %s\", email)\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t}\n\t\tbodyText := strings.Replace(*body, \"{name}\", name, -1)\n\t\tinput := &ses.SendEmailInput{\n\t\t\tSource: aws.String(*sender),\n\t\t\tDestination: &ses.Destination{\n\t\t\t>ToAddresses: aws.StringSlice([]string{email}),\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tMessage: &ses.Message{\n\t\t\t\tSubject: &ses.Content{\n\t\t\t\t\tData: aws.String(*subject),\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\tBody: &ses.Body{\n\t\t\t\t\tText: &ses.Content{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tData: aws.String(bodyText),\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t}\n\t\tif *format == \"html\" {\n\t\t\tinput.Message.Body.Html = &ses.Content{\n\t\t\t\tData: aws.String(bodyText),\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tif *dryRun {\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Dry run: would have sent email to %s\", email)\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t}\n\t\t_, err := sesSvc.SendEmail(input)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Error sending email to %s: %v\", email, err)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Email sent to %s\", email)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc isValidEmail(email string) bool {\n\temailRegex := regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`)\n\treturn emailRegex.MatchString(email)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Dependencies**:\n   - `kingpin`: For command-line flag parsing.\n   - `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws` and `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/ses`: For interacting with AWS SES.\n   - `gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2`: For structured command-line argument parsing.\n\n2. **Command-Line Flags**:\n   - `csv`: Path to the CSV file containing names and email addresses.\n   - `subject`: Subject of the email (default is \"Welcome!\").\n   - `body`: Body template of the email (default is \"Hello {name}, welcome!\").\n   - `format`: Format of the email body, either \"text\" or \"html\" (default is \"text\").\n   - `sender`: Sender email address.\n   - `region`: AWS region (default is \"us-west-2\").\n   - `dry-run`: Perform a dry run without sending emails (default is false).\n\n3. **CSV Handling**:\n   - Reads the CSV file and skips the header.\n   - Parses each row to extract name and email.\n   - Validates email addresses using a regular expression.\n\n4. **AWS SES Integration**:\n   - Configures AWS session with the specified region.\n   - Sends an email for each valid recipient using the `SendEmail` method.\n   - Supports both plain text and HTML email formats.\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - Skips rows with insufficient data or invalid email addresses.\n   - Logs errors encountered during email sending.\n\n6. **Dry Run Option**:\n   - Simulates the email sending process without actually sending emails, useful for testing.\n\nThis tool provides a robust way to send personalized emails to multiple recipients efficiently using Golang and AWS SES."
