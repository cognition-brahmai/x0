If the teacher picks one student at random, what's the probability that the chosen student is a girl?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, we need to figure out how many girls and how many boys are in the class. We know the total number of students is 40, and there are 10 more girls than boys.\n\nLet's use some variables to represent the numbers. Let\u2019s say the number of boys is B and the number of girls is G.\n\nFrom the problem, we have two pieces of information:\n\n1. G = B + 10 (there are 10 more girls than boys)\n\n2. G + B = 40 (the total number of students is 40)\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into the second one:\n\n(B + 10) + B = 40\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n2B + 10 = 40\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n2B = 30\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nB = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 boys in the class.\n\nNow, since G = B + 10, then G = 15 + 10 = 25\n\nTherefore, there are 25 girls in the class.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a girl at random is the number of girls divided by the total number of students.\n\nSo, Probability (girl) = Number of girls / Total students = 25 / 40\n\nWe can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n\n40 \u00f7 5 = 8\n\nSo, 5/8\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/8.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that.\n\nTotal students: 40\n\nGirls: 25\n\nProbability: 25/40 = 5/8\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal or a percentage.\n\n5 \u00f7 8 = 0.625, which is 62.5%\n\nSo, there's a 62.5% chance that the chosen student is a girl.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form of the answer, 5/8 is fine.\n\nLet me just make sure about the initial setup.\n\nWe had:\n\nG = B + 10\n\nAnd G + B = 40\n\nSubstituted G from the first equation into the second:\n\n(B + 10) + B = 40 \u2192 2B + 10 = 40 \u2192 2B = 30 \u2192 B = 15\n\nThen G = 15 + 10 = 25\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of boys is B, then the number of girls is B + 10.\n\nTotal students: B + (B + 10) = 40 \u2192 2B + 10 = 40 \u2192 2B = 30 \u2192 B = 15\n\nSame result.\n\nOr, if I let G be the number of girls, then G = B + 10, and G + B = 40.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI could also think about the difference in numbers.\n\nThere are 10 more girls than boys, and total students are 40.\n\nSo, if I let the number of boys be B, then girls are B + 10.\n\nTotal: B + B + 10 = 40 \u2192 2B + 10 = 40 \u2192 2B = 30 \u2192 B = 15\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think I\u2019ve confirmed it enough.\n\nSo, the probability is 25/40, which simplifies to 5/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}} \\]"
