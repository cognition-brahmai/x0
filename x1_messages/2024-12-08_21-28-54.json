        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and we're given some information about its dimensions and perimeter. The problem says that the length is 3 meters more than twice its width, and the perimeter is 38 meters. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width of the garden.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) is given by:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times \\text{length} + 2 \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nIn this case, P is 38 meters. So, we can write:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times \\text{length} + 2 \\times \\text{width} = 38 \\]\n\nBut we also have another piece of information: the length is 3 meters more than twice the width. Let's express that mathematically. Let's denote the width as W. Then, the length (L) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ L = 2W + 3 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for L into the perimeter equation:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times (2W + 3) + 2 \\times W = 38 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute the 2 into the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 4W + 6 + 2W = 38 \\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[ 4W + 2W + 6 = 38 \\]\n\n\\[ 6W + 6 = 38 \\]\n\nNext, subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the terms with W:\n\n\\[ 6W = 32 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{32}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{16}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ W \\approx 5.333... \\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let's check my calculations.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ 6W + 6 = 38 \\]\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 6W = 32 \\]\n\nThen, divide by 6:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{32}{6} = \\frac{16}{3} \\approx 5.333... \\]\n\nHmm, but I feel like there might be a mistake because the width is coming out to be a fraction, and I'm not sure if that's expected.\n\nLet me double-check the perimeter equation. Maybe I set it up incorrectly.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 38 meters, and the length is 3 meters more than twice the width, so L = 2W + 3.\n\nPerimeter formula: P = 2L + 2W = 38.\n\nSubstituting L:\n\n2(2W + 3) + 2W = 38.\n\nLet's distribute the 2:\n\n4W + 6 + 2W = 38.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n6W + 6 = 38.\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n6W = 32.\n\nDivide by 6:\n\nW = 32/6 = 16/3 \u2248 5.333...\n\nHmm, it's consistent. Maybe the width is indeed 16/3 meters. Let's proceed with that and find the length.\n\nL = 2W + 3 = 2*(16/3) + 3 = 32/3 + 3.\n\nConvert 3 to thirds: 3 = 9/3.\n\nSo, L = 32/3 + 9/3 = 41/3 \u2248 13.666... meters.\n\nNow, let's check if these dimensions give us the correct perimeter.\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W = 2*(41/3) + 2*(16/3) = 82/3 + 32/3 = 114/3 = 38 meters.\n\nYes, it checks out. So, the dimensions are width = 16/3 meters and length = 41/3 meters.\n\nBut I'm a bit uneasy because the widths are not whole numbers. Maybe there's a different approach or a mistake I'm missing.\n\nLet me try solving it again from the beginning.\n\nLet W be the width.\n\nThen, L = 2W + 3.\n\nPerimeter: 2L + 2W = 38.\n\nSubstitute L:\n\n2(2W + 3) + 2W = 38.\n\n4W + 6 + 2W = 38.\n\n6W + 6 = 38.\n\n6W = 32.\n\nW = 32/6 = 16/3 meters.\n\nL = 2*(16/3) + 3 = 32/3 + 9/3 = 41/3 meters.\n\nPerimeter check: 2*(41/3) + 2*(16/3) = 82/3 + 32/3 = 114/3 = 38 meters.\n\nIt's correct. Maybe the answer is indeed in fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in fractions, as 16/3 meters and 41/3 meters are exact values.\n\nAlternatively, we could express them in decimal form, but fractions are more precise.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are:\n\nWidth: 16/3 meters or approximately 5.333 meters.\n\nLength: 41/3 meters or approximately 13.666 meters.\n\nBut to be precise, we'll go with the fractional values.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are \\(\\boxed{\\text{width} = \\dfrac{16}{3} \\text{ meters}, \\text{ length} = \\dfrac{41}{3} \\text{ meters}}\\)."
