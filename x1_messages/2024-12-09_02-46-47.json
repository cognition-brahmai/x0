        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that in a certain city, every cat has 3 kittens, and every dog has 4 puppies. There are 20 cats and dogs combined, and they have 70 offspring in total. We need to find out how many cats there are.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of cats.\n\n- Let \\( d \\) represent the number of dogs.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of cats and dogs is 20. So, \\( c + d = 20 \\).\n\n2. The total number of offspring is 70. Since each cat has 3 kittens and each dog has 4 puppies, the total offspring can be represented as \\( 3c + 4d = 70 \\).\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations:\n\n(1) \\( c + d = 20 \\)\n\n(2) \\( 3c + 4d = 70 \\)\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( c \\), the number of cats.\n\nOne way to solve this system is by using the substitution method. We can solve equation (1) for one variable in terms of the other and then substitute that expression into equation (2).\n\nLet's solve equation (1) for \\( d \\):\n\n\\( d = 20 - c \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( d \\) into equation (2):\n\n\\( 3c + 4(20 - c) = 70 \\)\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\( 3c + 80 - 4c = 70 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( -c + 80 = 70 \\)\n\nSubtract 80 from both sides:\n\n\\( -c = -10 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\( c = 10 \\)\n\nSo, there are 10 cats.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. If there are 10 cats, then there are \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) dogs.\n\nNow, calculate the total offspring:\n\n- Cats: 10 cats \u00d7 3 kittens each = 30 kittens\n\n- Dogs: 10 dogs \u00d7 4 puppies each = 40 puppies\n\nTotal offspring: 30 + 40 = 70, which matches the given total.\n\nAlright, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the elimination method to solve the system of equations.\n\nLet's try that approach as well for verification.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n(1) \\( c + d = 20 \\)\n\n(2) \\( 3c + 4d = 70 \\)\n\nLet's manipulate the equations so that one of the variables cancels out.\n\nWe can multiply equation (1) by 3 to align the coefficients of \\( c \\):\n\n\\( 3c + 3d = 60 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this new equation from equation (2):\n\n\\( (3c + 4d) - (3c + 3d) = 70 - 60 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 3c + 4d - 3c - 3d = 10 \\)\n\nWhich reduces to:\n\n\\( d = 10 \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( d = 10 \\) back into equation (1):\n\n\\( c + 10 = 20 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c = 10 \\)\n\nAgain, we find that there are 10 cats.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about it and it seemed correct, but let's consider if there might be another way to look at this or if there's any possibility of a miscalculation.\n\nWhat if we assume different numbers? For example, if there were 12 cats and 8 dogs:\n\n- Cats: 12 \u00d7 3 = 36 kittens\n\n- Dogs: 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 puppies\n\nTotal offspring: 36 + 32 = 68, which is less than 70.\n\nAlternatively, if there were 9 cats and 11 dogs:\n\n- Cats: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 kittens\n\n- Dogs: 11 \u00d7 4 = 44 puppies\n\nTotal offspring: 27 + 44 = 71, which is more than 70.\n\nSo, 10 cats and 10 dogs giving 30 + 40 = 70 seems to be the correct balance.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the average number of offspring per animal.\n\nTotal offspring is 70, total animals are 20, so average offspring per animal is \\( 70 / 20 = 3.5 \\).\n\nSince cats have 3 offspring and dogs have 4, the average of 3.5 suggests an equal number of cats and dogs, which aligns with our solution of 10 cats and 10 dogs.\n\nAlternatively, we could set up the problem using weights or alligation method, but that might be more complicated for this scenario.\n\nIt's good to see that multiple methods lead us to the same conclusion, which increases confidence in the answer.\n\nSo, the number of cats is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
