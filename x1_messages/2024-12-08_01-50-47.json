        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces widgets at a rate of 50 widgets per hour. They decide to increase production by 20% every week. We need to find out how many widgets they'll produce in the fourth week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The factory increases its production rate by 20% each week. So, each week, the production rate is higher than the previous week's. We need to find the production in the fourth week.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nWeek 1:\n\nProduction rate: 50 widgets per hour.\n\nBut, how many hours does the factory work in a week? The problem doesn't specify, so I might need to assume something here. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the factory operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That's a common full-operation scenario.\n\nSo, hours per week = 24 hours/day * 7 days/week = 168 hours/week.\n\nTherefore, widgets produced in Week 1 = 50 widgets/hour * 168 hours/week.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n50 * 168 = 8400 widgets.\n\nWeek 2:\n\nProduction increases by 20%.\n\nSo, new production rate = original rate + 20% of original rate.\n\n20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 widgets per hour.\n\nTherefore, new rate = 50 + 10 = 60 widgets per hour.\n\nWidgets produced in Week 2 = 60 widgets/hour * 168 hours/week.\n\n60 * 168 = let's calculate:\n\n60 * 160 = 9600\n\n60 * 8 = 480\n\nTotal: 9600 + 480 = 10,080 widgets.\n\nWeek 3:\n\nAnother 20% increase.\n\n20% of 60 = 0.20 * 60 = 12 widgets per hour.\n\nNew rate = 60 + 12 = 72 widgets per hour.\n\nWidgets produced in Week 3 = 72 * 168.\n\nLet's compute 72 * 168:\n\n72 * 100 = 7200\n\n72 * 60 = 4320\n\n72 * 8 = 576\n\nTotal: 7200 + 4320 = 11,520 + 576 = 12,096 widgets.\n\nWeek 4:\n\nAnother 20% increase.\n\n20% of 72 = 0.20 * 72 = 14.4 widgets per hour.\n\nNew rate = 72 + 14.4 = 86.4 widgets per hour.\n\nWidgets produced in Week 4 = 86.4 * 168.\n\nLet's calculate 86.4 * 168.\n\nFirst, 86.4 * 100 = 8640\n\n86.4 * 60 = 5184\n\n86.4 * 8 = 691.2\n\nNow, sum them up: 8640 + 5184 = 13,824 + 691.2 = 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nSo, in the fourth week, the factory will produce 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nBut, it's unusual to have a fraction of a widget. Maybe we should round it off or consider if there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for compound increase that could make this calculation easier.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nYes, since the production increases by 20% each week, it's similar to compound interest.\n\nThe formula for compound growth is:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1 + rate)^time\n\nIn this case:\n\nInitial production rate = 50 widgets/hour\n\nRate of increase = 20% or 0.20\n\nTime (number of weeks) = 4\n\nBut, we need to find the production in the fourth week, not the total over four weeks.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"in the fourth week\", so it's the production during the fourth week only.\n\nSo, using the formula, the production rate in the fourth week would be:\n\nProduction rate_week4 = 50 * (1 + 0.20)^4\n\nLet's calculate (1 + 0.20)^4:\n\n1.20^4 = ?\n\n1.2^2 = 1.44\n\n1.44^2 = 2.0736\n\nSo, production rate_week4 = 50 * 2.0736 = 103.68 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, widgets produced in Week 4 = 103.68 * 168.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n100 * 168 = 16,800\n\n3.68 * 168:\n\nFirst, 3 * 168 = 504\n\n0.68 * 168:\n\n0.50 * 168 = 84\n\n0.18 * 168:\n\n0.10 * 168 = 16.8\n\n0.08 * 168 = 13.44\n\nSo, 16.8 + 13.44 = 30.24\n\nTherefore, 3.68 * 168 = 504 + 30.24 = 534.24\n\nTotal widgets in Week 4: 16,800 + 534.24 = 17,334.24 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, this is different from my earlier calculation of 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check my steps.\n\nIn the first approach, I calculated the production rate week by week, increasing by 20% each time, and then multiplied by the number of hours in a week.\n\nIn the second approach, I used the compound growth formula to find the production rate in the fourth week and then multiplied by the number of hours.\n\nThe results are different, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the compound growth formula approach.\n\nProduction rate in week 4 = 50 * (1.20)^4\n\n(1.20)^4 = 2.0736, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 50 * 2.0736 = 103.68 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, number of hours in a week = 168.\n\nTherefore, widgets in week 4 = 103.68 * 168.\n\nNow, 100 * 168 = 16,800\n\n3.68 * 168:\n\n3 * 168 = 504\n\n0.68 * 168:\n\n0.50 * 168 = 84\n\n0.18 * 168:\n\n0.10 * 168 = 16.8\n\n0.08 * 168 = 13.44\n\nSo, 84 + 13.44 = 97.44\n\nTherefore, 3.68 * 168 = 504 + 97.44 = 601.44\n\nThus, total widgets in week 4 = 16,800 + 601.44 = 17,401.44 widgets.\n\nWait, now I get 17,401.44, which is different from both my previous calculations.\n\nI think I made an error in the earlier addition.\n\nLet me recalculate 103.68 * 168 more carefully.\n\nFirst, 100 * 168 = 16,800\n\nThen, 3.68 * 168:\n\n3 * 168 = 504\n\n0.68 * 168:\n\n0.5 * 168 = 84\n\n0.18 * 168:\n\n0.1 * 168 = 16.8\n\n0.08 * 168 = 13.44\n\nSo, 84 + 16.8 + 13.44 = 114.24\n\nTherefore, 3.68 * 168 = 504 + 114.24 = 618.24\n\nThus, total widgets = 16,800 + 618.24 = 17,418.24\n\nWait, still different.\n\nI think I need a better way to calculate this.\n\nLet me try using the formula for compound growth for each week's production.\n\nWeek 1: 50 widgets/hour\n\nWeek 2: 50 * 1.20 = 60 widgets/hour\n\nWeek 3: 60 * 1.20 = 72 widgets/hour\n\nWeek 4: 72 * 1.20 = 86.4 widgets/hour\n\nNow, widgets in week 4 = 86.4 * 168 = ?\n\n80 * 168 = 13,440\n\n6.4 * 168:\n\n6 * 168 = 1,008\n\n0.4 * 168 = 67.2\n\nSo, 1,008 + 67.2 = 1,075.2\n\nTherefore, total widgets = 13,440 + 1,075.2 = 14,515.2\n\nWait, now I'm back to 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nBut according to the compound growth formula, I got 17,418.24.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, and I need to figure out which method is correct.\n\nLet me think about this differently.\n\nThe problem says \"increase production by 20% every week.\"\n\nDoes this mean that each week, the production rate is 20% higher than the previous week's rate?\n\nIf so, then the production rate in week n is initial rate * (1.20)^(n-1)\n\nSo, week 1: 50\n\nweek 2: 50 * 1.20\n\nweek 3: 50 * 1.20^2\n\nweek 4: 50 * 1.20^3\n\nWait, that seems more accurate.\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf the initial rate is 50, and it increases by 20% each week, then:\n\nWeek 1: 50\n\nWeek 2: 50 * 1.20 = 60\n\nWeek 3: 60 * 1.20 = 72\n\nWeek 4: 72 * 1.20 = 86.4\n\nSo, in week 4, the production rate is 86.4 widgets per hour.\n\nThen, widgets produced in week 4 = 86.4 * 168 = 14,515.2\n\nNow, using the compound growth formula, but correctly applied:\n\nProduction rate in week n = initial rate * (growth rate)^(n-1)\n\nSince the first week is the base, week 2 is initial * 1.20, week 3 is initial * 1.20^2, and week 4 is initial * 1.20^3\n\nSo, production rate in week 4 = 50 * 1.20^3\n\nLet's calculate 1.20^3:\n\n1.20^2 = 1.44\n\n1.44 * 1.20 = 1.728\n\nTherefore, 50 * 1.728 = 86.4 widgets per hour.\n\nThen, 86.4 * 168 = 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nEarlier, when I used (1.20)^4, that would be for week 5, not week 4.\n\nI see where I made the mistake. The exponent should be (n-1) where n is the week number.\n\nSo, for week 4, it's (1.20)^3, not (1.20)^4.\n\nTherefore, the correct production in week 4 is 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nBut, since we can't have a fraction of a widget, perhaps we should round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, approximately 14,515 widgets.\n\nWait, but the fraction is .2, which is 0.2 widgets. Maybe it's acceptable to have a decimal since it's a rate, but for total production, it's unusual.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory can't produce a fraction of a widget, so they would produce 14,515 widgets, rounding down.\n\nOr perhaps the factory operates in a way that they can produce partial widgets, but in reality, widgets are whole items.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut in the context of this problem, since it's a production rate, it might be acceptable to have a decimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory produces widgets in a continuous process, and the decimal represents a partial widget in the process.\n\nBut for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that the factory produces 14,515 widgets in the fourth week.\n\nWait, but my earlier calculation gave 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nIf we consider that the factory produces widgets continuously and the decimal is acceptable, then 14,515.2 is fine.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to round to the nearest whole number, it would be 14,515 widgets.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the decimal to be included.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"It produces widgets at a rate of 50 widgets per hour.\"\n\n\"Due to increasing demand, they decide to increase production by 20% every week.\"\n\n\"How many widgets will they produce in the fourth week?\"\n\nThe problem doesn't specify whether to round or not, so perhaps leaving it as 14,515.2 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me consider that the production rate increases by 20% each week, compounded.\n\nSo, the production rate in week n is 50 * (1.20)^(n-1)\n\nThen, the total production in week n is production rate * number of hours in the week.\n\nAssuming 168 hours per week, as before.\n\nTherefore, for week 4:\n\nProduction rate = 50 * (1.20)^3 = 50 * 1.728 = 86.4 widgets per hour.\n\nTotal production = 86.4 * 168 = 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 14,515.2 widgets.\n\nBut to present it clearly, perhaps I should box the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14515.2} \\]\n\nor, if rounding to the nearest whole number:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14515} \\]"
