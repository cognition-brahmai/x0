        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 250 widgets every day and operates 6 days a week. We need to find out how many widgets it will produce in 3 weeks.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many days the factory operates in 3 weeks. Since it operates 6 days a week, in 3 weeks that would be:\n\n6 days/week * 3 weeks = 18 days\n\nNow, if the factory produces 250 widgets each day, then in 18 days it would produce:\n\n250 widgets/day * 18 days = 4500 widgets\n\nSo, the factory will produce 4500 widgets in 3 weeks.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the weekly production first. The factory produces 250 widgets per day and operates 6 days a week, so:\n\n250 widgets/day * 6 days/week = 1500 widgets/week\n\nThen, for 3 weeks, the total production would be:\n\n1500 widgets/week * 3 weeks = 4500 widgets\n\nThat matches my first calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 4500 widgets.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of operating days in 3 weeks and multiply by the daily production. Since there are 3 weeks and it operates 6 days each week, that's 18 operating days. At 250 widgets per day, 18 * 250 equals 4500.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there are 7 days in a week, and the factory operates 6 days a week, it's operating approximately 6/7 of the time. But since we're dealing with whole weeks and specific days, it's more accurate to use the first method.\n\nIt's also important to note that the factory does not operate on one day of the week, but since we're looking at a span of 3 weeks with operation on 6 days each week, we don't need to account for any additional days outside of those 18 operating days.\n\nSo, to summarize, the factory produces 250 widgets per day, operates 6 days a week, and we're looking at 3 weeks. Therefore, total production is 250 * 6 * 3 = 4500 widgets.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Is there anything else to consider here? Maybe whether there are any holidays or maintenance days in those 3 weeks that might affect production, but since the question doesn't mention any such things, I'll assume that the factory operates as usual.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"how many widgets will it produce,\" assuming normal operation without any interruptions. So, based on the given information, 4500 widgets is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's a possibility of rounding or any fractional widgets, but since widgets are whole items, producing a fraction of a widget doesn't make sense. Therefore, the answer should be a whole number, which it is.\n\nMoreover, if the factory were to operate every day of the week, it would produce more, but according to the problem, it only operates 6 days a week.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory will produce 4500 widgets in 3 weeks, operating 6 days each week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4500} \\]"
