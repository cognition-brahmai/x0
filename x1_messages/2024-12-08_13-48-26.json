        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this question about penicillin. I need to find out who discovered it and how it impacted medicine. I have some tools to help me with this: GoogleSearch, TextExtractor, and QAEngine. I'll use these step by step to gather and make sense of the information.\n\n**Step 1:** First, I need to find some basic information about who discovered penicillin. I can use GoogleSearch for this.\n\n- #E1 = GoogleSearch[\"who discovered penicillin\"]\n\nThis should give me a list of search results where I can find the answer.\n\n**Step 2:** Once I have the search results, I need to pick the most relevant one to get the information. I'll assume that the top result is reliable, but I should check a few to be sure.\n\n- #E2 = TextExtractor[#E1]\n\nThis will help me extract the key points from the search results.\n\n**Step 3:** Now, I need to identify who the discoverer was from the extracted information. I can use QAEngine for this.\n\n- #E3 = QAEngine[\"Who discovered penicillin?\", given #E2]\n\nThis should give me a direct answer to who discovered it.\n\n**Step 4:** Next, I need to find out about the impact of penicillin on medicine. Again, I can use GoogleSearch for this.\n\n- #E4 = GoogleSearch[\"impact of penicillin on medicine\"]\n\nThis will give me search results related to the impact of penicillin.\n\n**Step 5:** Similar to step 2, I need to extract the relevant information from these search results.\n\n- #E5 = TextExtractor[#E4]\n\nThis will help me get the key points about the impact.\n\n**Step 6:** Now, I need to summarize the impact of penicillin on medicine. I can use QAEngine for this.\n\n- #E6 = QAEngine[\"What was the impact of penicillin on medicine?\", given #E5]\n\nThis should provide a summary of how penicillin affected the field of medicine.\n\n**Step 7:** Finally, I need to combine the information about the discoverer and the impact to form a complete answer.\n\n- #E7 = QAEngine[\"Who discovered penicillin and what was its impact on medicine?\", given #E3 and #E6]\n\nThis will give me a comprehensive answer to the question.\n\n**Final Answer:** #E7\n\nI think this plan should help me get the information I need about penicillin's discovery and its impact on medicine. I'll proceed step by step, using each tool as needed to gather and process the data."
