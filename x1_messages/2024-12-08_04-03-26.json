        "content": "Let's see... I need to find an adjective that means wide in extent, and it's an anagram of \"board.\" So, first, I should list out the letters in \"board\": B, O, A, R, D. Now, I need to rearrange these letters to form a word that describes something that is wide in extent.\n\nHmm, words related to width or extent... maybe something like \"spacious\" or \"extensive,\" but those don't match the letters in \"board.\" Okay, perhaps I need to think smaller. Is there a shorter word that fits?\n\nLet's consider the letters: B, O, A, R, D. Maybe if I look for a word that has to do with breadth or width. Like, \"broad\" \u2013 wait, that's only using some of the letters, but \"broad\" does mean wide. But it's not an anagram of \"board\" because \"board\" has an 'O' and an 'A' that aren't in \"broad.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"abroad\" \u2013 that includes all the letters in \"board\" plus an extra 'A.' But \"abroad\" means in a foreign country, not wide in extent.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the word isn't directly about width but has that meaning. For example, \"spare\" could mean not extensive, so that doesn't fit. What about \"barred\"? No, that means blocked or restricted.\n\nWait, perhaps \"bardoo\" \u2013 but I'm not sure what that means, and it doesn't seem related to width.\n\nLet me try rearranging the letters differently. For example, \"robad\" \u2013 that doesn't make sense. Or \"dobra\" \u2013 I'm not familiar with that word.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the word could be a less common one. Perhaps it's \"dobra,\" which I think is a type of cloth, but I'm not sure if it relates to width.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"borad\" \u2013 but that seems like a misspelling.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the word is \"broad\" and the extra letters are irrelevant. But that doesn't seem right because an anagram should use all the letters.\n\nLet me check the definition again: an adjective meaning wide in extent, and an anagram of \"board.\" Maybe I need to consider that the word could be a different length or that some letters are repeated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a word that is a subset of these letters. For example, \"road\" \u2013 but that doesn't include 'B' and 'A,' and it's not necessarily about width.\n\nWhat about \"bard\"? That's a poet, not related to width. Or \"abode,\" which is a place to live, again not related.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the word is simply \"broad,\" and the extra letters in \"board\" don't matter. But that doesn't feel right for an anagram.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a word that means wide in extent and uses all the letters in \"board.\" Let's see: B, O, A, R, D.\n\nWait, what if I add an 'E' to make \"boarder\"? But that means someone who lives in someone else's home, not wide in extent.\n\nAlternatively, \"abored\" \u2013 that's not a word.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the meaning more. Wide in extent could mean extensive, broad, wide, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the word is \"breadth,\" but that has an 'E' and 'T' that aren't in \"board.\"\n\nAlternatively, \"bread\" \u2013 but that's not an adjective.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to consider that the word isn't directly about width but has that meaning in a specific context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a rare or obscure word that I'm not familiar with.\n\nLet me try to think of other words related to width. There's \"amplitude,\" but that uses different letters.\n\nWhat about \"scope\"? That can mean extent, but the letters don't match.\n\nAlternatively, \"span\"? That means the extent or distance between two points, but again, the letters don't match.\n\nWait, what about \"spread\"? That can mean extensive or wide, but it uses an extra 'E' and 'D.'\n\nHmm, not matching the letters in \"board.\"\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the anagram isn't the entire word but a part of it.\n\nFor example, \"rob\" isn't related to width.\n\nAlternatively, \"bar\" isn't related to width.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe I need to look at the letters differently.\n\nB, O, A, R, D.\n\nIf I arrange them as \"broad,\" which is close, but not exact.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a word that sounds like \"broad\" but uses all the letters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a word that is rarely used or archaic.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's a word from another language or a specialized term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the correct anagram is something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the word is \"barred,\" but that means obstructed, not wide.\n\nAlternatively, \"board\" itself can be used as an adjective, but I'm not sure what it would mean in that context.\n\nMaybe \"board-wide,\" but that's two words, not one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's \"borda,\" but I don't know what that means.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"broaden,\" but that has an extra 'E' and 'N.'\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's \"borad,\" but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"bordaa,\" but again, not familiar.\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe I need to accept that there isn't a direct anagram of \"board\" that means wide in extent, and perhaps there's a mistake in the puzzle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"broad,\" acknowledging that it's not a perfect anagram but the closest possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is \"abode,\" and in some contexts, it could relate to extent, but that seems stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps \"abode\" refers to a place, which has extent, but that's a bit loose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"dobra,\" which I think is a type of cloth, and cloths can be wide, so maybe that fits.\n\nIf \"dobra\" means a type of cloth, and cloths are often wide, then perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"baroda,\" but I'm not sure what that refers to.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"bardoe,\" but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"bordaa,\" but again, unfamiliar.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the answer is \"broad\" and accept that it's not a perfect anagram.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the word is \"borda,\" which I think is a game, but I'm not sure about its characteristics.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look up an anagram solver for \"board\" to see possible words.\n\nAssuming I can't do that, I need to think creatively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"abode,\" and in some contexts, it could refer to a spacious living place.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"dobra,\" assuming it's a wide cloth.\n\nGiven that, I might conclude that \"dobra\" is the answer, assuming it refers to a wide cloth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"broad,\" acknowledging that it's not a perfect anagram but the closest possible.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll go with \"broad\" as the answer, understanding that it's not a perfect anagram of \"board\" but is the best fit for the description provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{broad}} \\]"
