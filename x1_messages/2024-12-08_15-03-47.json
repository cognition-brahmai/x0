        "content": "No, poor hygiene and eating fatty foods do not directly cause acne. Acne is primarily caused by hormonal changes that lead to increased oil production in the skin, combined with dead skin cells and bacteria clogging hair follicles. While maintaining good hygiene is important for overall skin health, excessive cleaning or scrubbing can sometimes worsen acne by irritating the skin. Similarly, diet can influence skin health, but there is no direct evidence linking fatty foods to acne development. It's more about maintaining a balanced diet and considering individual sensitivities."
