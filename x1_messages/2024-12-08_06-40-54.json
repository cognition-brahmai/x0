        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is (4^2 - 3 * 5) / (2 + 6). Okay, first things first, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting inside the parentheses:\n\nFirst, I have 4^2. Exponents come before subtraction, so 4 squared is 16.\n\nNext, 3 * 5 is multiplication, which also comes before subtraction. 3 times 5 is 15.\n\nSo, inside the first set of parentheses, it's 16 - 15, which is 1.\n\nNow, moving to the denominator: 2 + 6, which is straightforward. 2 plus 6 is 8.\n\nSo now, the expression simplifies to 1 / 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1/8.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet's go through it again:\n\n(4^2 - 3 * 5) / (2 + 6)\n\nCompute exponents: 4^2 = 16\n\nSo, (16 - 3 * 5) / (2 + 6)\n\nNext, multiplication: 3 * 5 = 15\n\nNow, (16 - 15) / (2 + 6)\n\nThen, subtraction: 16 - 15 = 1\n\nAnd addition in the denominator: 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSo, 1 / 8.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are any implied operations or other rules I might have forgotten, but in this case, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
