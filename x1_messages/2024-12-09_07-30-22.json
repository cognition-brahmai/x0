        "content": "Let's see. So, the car first travels at 50 miles per hour for 3 hours, and then it speeds up to 70 miles per hour for another 2 hours. I need to find out the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nOkay, average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? So, I should first find out the total distance the car traveled and then divide it by the total time spent traveling.\n\nFirst, for the first part of the trip: speed is 50 mph for 3 hours. So, distance is speed times time, which is 50 times 3, that's 150 miles.\n\nThen, for the second part: 70 mph for 2 hours. Distance is 70 times 2, which is 140 miles.\n\nSo, total distance is 150 plus 140, that's 290 miles.\n\nTotal time is 3 hours plus 2 hours, which is 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, average speed is total distance divided by total time, so 290 divided by 5.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 290 divided by 5 is 58 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that average speed isn't always just the total distance over total time. Sometimes, if speeds are different for different parts of the trip, there might be another way to calculate it. Maybe I should check if this is correct.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I can find the harmonic mean of the speeds, since it's about rates and travel times.\n\nThe formula for average speed when traveling equal distances at different speeds is the harmonic mean, but in this case, the distances are not equal. The times are equal in some parts, but not all.\n\nWait, no, the times are different for each speed. So, perhaps the first method is the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the weighted average of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, that would be (50 mph for 3 hours and 70 mph for 2 hours). So, the weights are the times.\n\nSo, the weighted average would be (50*3 + 70*2) divided by (3 + 2), which is the same as my first calculation: (150 + 140)/5 = 290/5 = 58 mph.\n\nOkay, that matches my first answer. So, it seems like 58 mph is the correct average speed for the entire journey.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using the total displacement, but since the problem doesn't specify the direction, and it's just talking about distance traveled, I think total distance divided by total time is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, if the car had traveled the same distance at both speeds, then the average speed would be different, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with 58 mph as the average speed for the entire journey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{58} \\]"
