        "content": "Butterflies undergo a fascinating process known as metamorphosis during their lifecycle. They start out as eggs laid on leaves, from which caterpillars emerge. Caterpillars then feed voraciously, growing rapidly until they form a chrysalis or pupa. Inside this protective casing, the caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, eventually emerging as a fully formed adult ready to mate and lay eggs, thus completing the cycle. Which stage of the butterfly lifecycle involves the most dramatic physical changes?\nA) Egg stage\nB) Caterpillar stage\nC) Pupa stage\nD) Adult stage"

        "content": "The stage of the butterfly lifecycle that involves the most dramatic physical changes is the pupa stage. During this stage, the caterpillar undergoes a remarkable transformation known as metamorphosis, where its body is restructured entirely to become a butterfly. This process includes the breakdown of most of the caterpillar's tissues and the reorganization of its internal structures to form the wings, antennae, and other features of the adult butterfly. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Pupa stage."
