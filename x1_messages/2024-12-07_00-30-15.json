        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 250 units every day and operates 6 days a week. I need to find out how many units are produced in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the weekly production. Since it works 6 days a week, I can multiply the daily production by the number of operating days in a week.\n\nSo, weekly production = daily production \u00d7 operating days per week = 250 units/day \u00d7 6 days/week.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 250 \u00d7 6.\n\n250 \u00d7 6 is 1,500 units per week.\n\nNow, to find the production over 4 weeks, I need to multiply the weekly production by the number of weeks.\n\nSo, total production = weekly production \u00d7 number of weeks = 1,500 units/week \u00d7 4 weeks.\n\nLet's multiply that: 1,500 \u00d7 4.\n\n1,500 \u00d7 4 is 6,000 units.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 250 units per day times 6 days per week is indeed 1,500 units per week.\n\nThen, 1,500 units per week times 4 weeks is 6,000 units.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of operating days in 4 weeks and then multiply by the daily production.\n\nNumber of operating days in 4 weeks: 6 days/week \u00d7 4 weeks = 24 days.\n\nThen, total production: 250 units/day \u00d7 24 days = 6,000 units.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total production in terms of days and weeks separately.\n\nBut anyway, both methods give me 6,000 units.\n\nSo, the factory produces 6,000 units in 4 weeks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
