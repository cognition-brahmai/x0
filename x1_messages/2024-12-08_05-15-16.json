It's renowned for its unique system of canals that serve as major transportation routes instead of roads. Gondolas, those traditional rowing boats, are a iconic way to navigate through the city's waterways. St. Mark's Basilica and the Doge's Palace are also located in Venice, adding to its rich historical and architectural heritage. So, Venice seems to fit the description perfectly."
