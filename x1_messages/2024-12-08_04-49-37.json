        "content": "To find the volume of a cylindrical water tank, I can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nFirst, I need to find the radius of the tank. The diameter is given as 10 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is 5 feet.\n\nNext, I'll square the radius: 5\u00b2 = 25.\n\nThen, I'll multiply that by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14, I'll use that value: 25 * 3.14 = 78.5.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply that result by the height of the tank, which is 15 feet: 78.5 * 15.\n\nLet me calculate that: 78.5 * 10 = 785, and 78.5 * 5 = 392.5. Adding those together, 785 + 392.5 = 1177.5.\n\nSo, the volume of the tank is approximately 1177.5 cubic feet.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over:\n\nRadius (r) = diameter / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 feet.\n\nArea of the base (\u03c0r\u00b2) = 3.14 * (5)^2 = 3.14 * 25 = 78.5 square feet.\n\nVolume (V) = base area * height = 78.5 * 15.\n\nNow, 78.5 * 10 = 785, and 78.5 * 5 = 392.5. Adding them together, 785 + 392.5 = 1177.5 cubic feet.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 15 as 10 + 5, so 78.5 * 15 = 78.5 * (10 + 5) = 785 + 392.5 = 1177.5.\n\nOr, I can multiply 78.5 by 15 directly:\n\n  78.5\n\nx 15\n\n------\n\n 392.5 (78.5 * 5)\n\n+785.0 (78.5 * 10)\n\n------\n\n1177.5\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cylindrical water tank is approximately 1177.5 cubic feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1177.5} \\]"
