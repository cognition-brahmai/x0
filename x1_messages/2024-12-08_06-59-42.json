Fully connected topology.\n\nIn such a topology, every node has a direct link to all other nodes, which means that the number of connections grows quadratically with the number of nodes. This can be represented mathematically as n(n-1)/2 connections for n nodes.\n\nOther options like star topology involve nodes connecting to a central hub, ring topology connects nodes in a circular chain, and mesh topology is a general term for networks where nodes are connected to more than just two other nodes, but not necessarily to every other node.\n\nSo, specifically, when every node is connected to every other node, it's referred to as a fully connected topology."
