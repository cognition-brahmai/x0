        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 marbles in total, and they're equally divided among four colors: red, blue, green, and yellow. So, that means there are 5 marbles of each color, right? Because 20 divided by 4 is 5.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that if I pick two marbles without replacement, both are the same color. Okay, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to pick two marbles out of 20. That's a combination problem, since the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 marbles out of 20 is C(20, 2). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 2) = 20! / (2!(20 - 2)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 18!) = (20 \u00d7 19) / 2 = 190.\n\nSo, there are 190 possible pairs of marbles.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the pairs where both marbles are the same color. Since there are four colors, and for each color, there are 5 marbles, I can calculate the number of ways to pick two marbles of the same color for one color and then multiply by four.\n\nFor one color, say red, the number of ways to pick two red marbles is C(5, 2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, for each color, there are 10 pairs of marbles of that color. Since there are four colors, the total number of favorable pairs is 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles are the same color is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 40 / 190.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10: 40 \u00f7 10 = 4, and 190 \u00f7 10 = 19. So, it's 4/19.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way to calculate probability is to consider the probabilities step by step, considering the without replacement condition.\n\nSo, the probability that the first marble is of any color is 1, since you're just picking one without any conditions.\n\nThen, given that the first marble is of a certain color, the probability that the second marble is the same color.\n\nAfter picking the first marble, there are 19 marbles left in the bag. If the first marble was, say, red, then there are 4 red marbles left out of the 19 remaining marbles.\n\nSo, the probability that the second marble is also red, given that the first one was red, is 4/19.\n\nBut since the first marble could be any color, and the situation is symmetric for all colors, the overall probability should be the same.\n\nWait, but actually, since the first marble can be any color, I need to consider the probability for each color and then sum them up.\n\nThe probability that the first marble is red is 5/20 = 1/4.\n\nGiven that, the probability that the second marble is also red is 4/19.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that the first marble is blue is also 1/4, and given that, the probability that the second is also blue is 4/19.\n\nThis is the same for green and yellow.\n\nSo, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each color:\n\nP(same color) = P(first is red and second is red) + P(first is blue and second is blue) + P(first is green and second is green) + P(first is yellow and second is yellow).\n\nEach of these is (1/4) \u00d7 (4/19) = 1/19.\n\nSince there are four colors, P(same color) = 4 \u00d7 (1/19) = 4/19.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations again. The total number of ways to pick two marbles of the same color is the sum of the number of ways to pick two marbles from each color.\n\nAs calculated before, for each color, it's C(5, 2) = 10, and there are four colors, so 40.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick any two marbles is C(20, 2) = 190.\n\nSo again, probability is 40/190 = 4/19.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{19}} \\]"
