        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with two types of employees: full-time and part-time. Full-time employees work 40 hours per week, and part-time employees work 20 hours per week. The company has a total of 50 employees, and together they work 1,600 hours per week. We need to find out how many full-time and part-time employees there are.\n\nFirst, I think it would be helpful to define variables for the number of full-time and part-time employees. Let's say:\n\n- Let F be the number of full-time employees.\n\n- Let P be the number of part-time employees.\n\nWe know that the total number of employees is 50, so:\n\nF + P = 50\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNext, we know that full-time employees work 40 hours per week, and part-time employees work 20 hours per week. The total hours worked by all employees per week is 1,600 hours. So, we can write another equation for the total hours:\n\n40F + 20P = 1,600\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) F + P = 50\n\n2) 40F + 20P = 1,600\n\nI think the best way to solve this is by using the substitution or elimination method. Maybe I'll try the elimination method first.\n\nIf I take equation 1), F + P = 50, I can multiply both sides by 20 to make the coefficients of P the same in both equations.\n\nSo, 20(F + P) = 20 * 50\n\nWhich gives:\n\n20F + 20P = 1,000\n\nNow, I have:\n\n20F + 20P = 1,000\n\nAnd from equation 2):\n\n40F + 20P = 1,600\n\nIf I subtract the first equation from the second equation, the P terms will cancel out.\n\nSo:\n\n(40F + 20P) - (20F + 20P) = 1,600 - 1,000\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n20F = 600\n\nNow, dividing both sides by 20:\n\nF = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 full-time employees.\n\nNow, plugging back into equation 1):\n\nF + P = 50\n\n30 + P = 50\n\nSubtracting 30 from both sides:\n\nP = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 30 full-time employees and 20 part-time employees.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf there are 30 full-time employees at 40 hours each, that's 30 * 40 = 1,200 hours.\n\nPlus 20 part-time employees at 20 hours each, that's 20 * 20 = 400 hours.\n\nTotal hours: 1,200 + 400 = 1,600 hours, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, 30 full-time plus 20 part-time equals 50 employees, which matches the total number of employees.\n\nLooks good to me!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ full-time employees and } 20 \\text{ part-time employees}} \\]"
