I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, right? So, d = s * t.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the units for time and speed are compatible. Here, speed is in miles per hour, and time is given in hours and minutes. I need to convert the time entirely into hours because the speed is per hour.\n\nSo, I have 3 hours and 45 minutes. I need to convert 45 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 hours. Let me calculate that:\n\n45 \u00f7 60 = 0.75 hours.\n\nSo, total time in hours is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.\n\nNow, I can plug this into the formula:\n\nd = 65 miles per hour * 3.75 hours.\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n65 * 3.75.\n\nHmm, how do I calculate that? Maybe I can break it down. 65 multiplied by 3 is 195, and 65 multiplied by 0.75 is, let's see, 65 * 0.75.\n\nWell, 65 * 0.75 is the same as 65 * 3/4, since 0.75 is three-quarters.\n\n65 * 3/4 = (65 * 3) / 4.\n\n65 * 3 = 195.\n\n195 / 4 = 48.75.\n\nSo, 65 * 0.75 = 48.75 miles.\n\nNow, adding that to the 65 * 3:\n\n195 + 48.75 = 243.75 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance traveled is 243.75 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can convert the time into minutes and see.\n\n3 hours and 45 minutes is equal to (3 * 60) + 45 = 180 + 45 = 225 minutes.\n\nNow, the speed is 65 miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the speed in miles per minute would be 65 miles per 60 minutes.\n\nSo, 65 \u00f7 60 = 1.0833... miles per minute.\n\nNow, distance = speed * time.\n\nSo, d = 1.0833... miles per minute * 225 minutes.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1.0833 * 225.\n\nWell, 1 * 225 = 225.\n\n0.0833 * 225 = let's see, 0.08 * 225 = 18, and 0.0033 * 225 \u2248 7.425.\n\nSo, total distance is approximately 225 + 18 + 7.425 = 250.425 miles.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Earlier, I got 243.75 miles, and now it's 250.425 miles. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the second method. Let me double-check the conversion.\n\nSpeed is 65 miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so miles per minute is 65/60.\n\n65 divided by 60 is indeed approximately 1.0833 miles per minute.\n\nNow, time is 225 minutes.\n\nSo, distance should be 1.0833 * 225.\n\nLet me do the multiplication again:\n\n1 * 225 = 225.\n\n0.0833 * 225:\n\n0.08 * 225 = 18.\n\n0.0033 * 225 = approximately 0.7425.\n\nSo, total distance is 225 + 18 + 0.7425 = 243.7425 miles.\n\nOkay, so now it matches the first method's result. The earlier addition must have been a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the correct distance traveled is 243.75 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the time as a fraction of hours directly.\n\n3 hours and 45 minutes is 3 + 45/60 hours, which is 3.75 hours, as I did earlier.\n\nThen, distance = 65 * 3.75 = 243.75 miles.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 3 hours at 65 mph is 195 miles, and 0.75 hours at 65 mph is 48.75 miles, totaling 243.75 miles.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 243.75 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{243.75 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
