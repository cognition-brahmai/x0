However, if the information is unclear or insufficient, I should use another tool for more specific data.\n\n#E2 = If #E1 does not provide clear information, then use NatGeoData[\"Australian saltwater crocodile diet\"]\n\nPlan: Alternatively, since NatGeoData specializes in animal facts, it might have more detailed information about the crocodile's diet.\n\n#E3 = If #E2 is still unclear, use ZooDB[\"Australian saltwater crocodile feeding habits\"]\n\nPlan: ZooDB could offer specialized zoological information that might be more detailed.\n\n#E4 = If necessary, cross-reference the information from #E1, #E2, and #E3 to confirm the primary diet.\n\nFinal answer: Based on the evidence from #E1, #E2, and #E3, the primary diet of the Australian saltwater crocodile consists of fish, birds, mammals, and occasionally other reptiles and amphibians."
