        "content": "The primary purpose of a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) in forensic science is to identify the presence of specific substances within a test sample. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nLet me explain why the other options are not primary purposes:\n\nB. To determine the age of a sample: GC-MS is not typically used for dating samples. Methods like radiocarbon dating are used to determine the age of organic materials.\n\nC. To compare the DNA profiles of two samples: GC-MS is not designed for DNA analysis. DNA profiling is usually performed using techniques such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis.\n\nD. To visualize the structure of a sample: While mass spectrometry can provide structural information about molecules, in the context of forensic science, GC-MS is primarily used for substance identification rather than detailed structural visualization.\n\nE. Both B and D: Since neither B nor D is the primary purpose, this option is also incorrect.\n\nGC-MS is a powerful analytical tool that combines the features of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to separate, identify, and quantify complex mixtures. In forensic science, it's widely used for drug testing, toxicology, and analyzing trace evidence such as fibers, fire debris, and explosives."
