The problem says there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, and three times as many green balls as red balls. And altogether, there are 72 balls. I need to find out how many there are of each color.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably assign some variables to represent the number of each color of ball. Let's say:\n\n- Let B represent the number of blue balls.\n\n- Then, since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, Red = 2B.\n\n- And there are three times as many green balls as red balls, so Green = 3 times Red, which is 3 times 2B, so Green = 6B.\n\nAlright, now, the total number of balls is 72, so:\n\nBlue + Red + Green = B + 2B + 6B = 9B = 72.\n\nSo, 9B = 72.\n\nNow, to find B, I can divide both sides by 9:\n\nB = 72 / 9 = 8.\n\nSo, there are 8 blue balls.\n\nThen, Red = 2B = 2 * 8 = 16.\n\nAnd Green = 6B = 6 * 8 = 48.\n\nLet me check if that adds up: 8 + 16 + 48 = 72. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, there are 8 blue balls, 16 red balls, and 48 green balls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8 \\text{ blue balls}, 16 \\text{ red balls}, 48 \\text{ green balls}} \\]"
