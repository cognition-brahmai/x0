        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, there are 10 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many handshakes one person would make. If there are 10 people, and one person shakes hands with everyone else, that would be 9 handshakes, right? Because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nBut wait, if every person does that, then it would seem like there are 10 people each shaking hands with 9 others, which would be 10 times 9, equal to 90 handshakes. However, I think that double counts each handshake because when person A shakes hands with person B, it's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, in my initial calculation, I've counted each handshake twice.\n\nTo correct for that, I should divide the total by 2. So, 90 divided by 2 equals 45. Therefore, there are 45 unique handshakes.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using combinations. I recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of n items is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n is 10, so C(10, 2) would be 10 times 9 divided by 2, which is again 45. That matches my earlier result, which is a good sign.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to think about this to confirm? Let's try starting with smaller numbers and seeing if there's a pattern.\n\nSuppose there are 2 people: A and B. They shake hands once. So, total handshakes are 1.\n\nWith 3 people: A, B, and C. A shakes hands with B and C (2 handshakes), B shakes hands with C (1 handshake), total is 3.\n\nFor 4 people: A, B, C, D. A shakes hands with B, C, D (3 handshakes), B shakes hands with C, D (2 handshakes), C shakes hands with D (1 handshake), total is 6.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\n5 people: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes.\n\n6 people: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15.\n\n7 people: 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21.\n\n8 people: 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28.\n\n9 people: 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36.\n\n10 people: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45.\n\nAgain, I get 45 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each person shaking hands with every other person, so it's the number of unique pairs of people. That's again C(10, 2), which is 45.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of overlapping handshakes or some handshakes being counted multiple times. But no, each handshake is unique between two distinct individuals, and we're assuming no one shakes hands with the same person more than once.\n\nAlso, the problem states that everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, so no exceptions or restrictions are mentioned.\n\nAnother angle: if I were to label the people from 1 to 10, the handshakes would be all possible pairs like (1,2), (1,3), ..., (1,10), (2,3), (2,4), ..., up to (9,10). Counting these, it's clear it's C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nI can also think recursively. If there are n people, the number of handshakes is the number of handshakes with n-1 people plus the handshakes that the nth person makes with the other n-1 people.\n\nSo, H(n) = H(n-1) + (n-1), with H(2) = 1.\n\nThen:\n\nH(2) = 1\n\nH(3) = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nH(4) = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nH(5) = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n...\n\nH(10) = H(9) + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45.\n\nAgain, 45 handshakes.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles\u2014using simple multiplication and division to correct for double counting, using combinations, building a pattern with smaller numbers, and thinking recursively\u2014and each method leads me to the same conclusion that there are 45 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
