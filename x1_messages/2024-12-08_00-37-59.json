        "content": "So there are 8 cats in the room, and each cat has 4 legs. To find out how many legs there are in total, I just need to multiply the number of cats by the number of legs each cat has. So, that would be 8 cats times 4 legs per cat. Let's do the math: 8 times 4 is 32. So, there are 32 legs in total.\n\nWait a minute, the question also mentions that each cat has 2 eyes, but it's asking for the total number of legs, not eyes. So, I don't need to worry about the eyes for this problem. It's just there to give extra information, maybe to see if I can focus on the relevant details.\n\nJust to double-check, if there are 8 cats and each has 4 legs, then indeed, 8 times 4 equals 32 legs. Yes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
