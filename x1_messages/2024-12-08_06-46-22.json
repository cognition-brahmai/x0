        "content": "Let's see. I have a basket with 10 apples. I give half of them to my friend Bob. So, half of 10 is 5. So, I give 5 apples to Bob. Now, I have 10 minus 5, which is 5 apples left in the basket.\n\nThen, I eat two myself. So, I take two apples from the remaining five and eat them. So, 5 minus 2 is 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 apples left in the basket.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStarting with 10 apples.\n\nGive half to Bob: 10 / 2 = 5 apples to Bob.\n\nSo, basket now has 10 - 5 = 5 apples.\n\nThen, I eat 2 apples from the basket: 5 - 2 = 3 apples.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nTotal apples initially: 10.\n\nGiven to Bob: 5.\n\nEaten by me: 2.\n\nSo, total given away or eaten: 5 + 2 = 7.\n\nTherefore, apples left in the basket: 10 - 7 = 3.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of fractions.\n\nInitially, 10 apples.\n\nGive half to Bob: that's multiplying by 1/2, which is 10 * 1/2 = 5 apples.\n\nThen, eat 2 apples: 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nOr, perhaps using percentages.\n\nHalf is 50%.\n\nSo, 10 apples, 50% given to Bob: 10 * 0.5 = 5.\n\nThen, eat 2: 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think it's clear that there are 3 apples left in the basket.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nFor example, maybe the basket isn't emptied of the apples given to Bob and eaten by me; perhaps they're still considered in the basket somehow.\n\nBut according to the problem, I gave half to Bob, which means they're removed from the basket, and then I ate two from the remaining apples in the basket, so those are also removed.\n\nSo, the basket should have 3 apples left.\n\nAlternatively, if the eating part is ambiguous, let's look back at the problem.\n\n\"It says: 'Then you eat two yourself.' \"\n\nIt seems that I eat two of the apples that are in the basket.\n\nSo, after giving half to Bob, I have 5 left, and then I eat two of those five, leaving three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the eating happens before giving to Bob.\n\nBut the problem says: \"You give half of them to your friend Bob. Then you eat two yourself.\"\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n1. Give half to Bob.\n\n2. Then eat two.\n\nNot the other way around.\n\nSo, order of operations is important here.\n\nIf I had eaten two first and then given half to Bob, the calculation would be different.\n\nBut according to the problem, I give half to Bob first, then eat two.\n\nSo, starting with 10, give 5 to Bob, leaving 5, then eat 2, leaving 3.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nPerhaps to make sure, I can set up an equation.\n\nLet x be the initial number of apples, which is 10.\n\nAfter giving half to Bob: x/2 left.\n\nThen eating two: x/2 - 2.\n\nSo, plugging in x = 10: 10/2 - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, using ratios.\n\nInitially, 10 apples.\n\nAfter giving half to Bob, I have 1/2 of x.\n\nThen eating two, which is subtracting 2.\n\nSo again, 1/2 * x - 2.\n\nWith x = 10, it's 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nConsistent every time.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nBut it's always good to verify in multiple ways to ensure correctness.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it in terms of addition.\n\nIf I have 3 apples left, and I add back the two I ate, that's 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nThen, if I add back the 5 I gave to Bob, that's 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWhich matches the initial number.\n\nSo, it makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3 apples left in the basket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
