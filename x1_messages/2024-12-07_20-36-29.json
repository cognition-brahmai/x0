Okay, let's start by understanding what it means for a metric space to be complete.\n\nA metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in that space converges to a limit within the space. So, in this case, I need to show that any Cauchy sequence in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with respect to the metric \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\) converges to a real number.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a Cauchy sequence is. A sequence \\((x_n)\\) is Cauchy if for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists an integer \\(N\\) such that for all \\(m, n > N\\), \\(d(x_m, x_n) < \\epsilon\\). In this metric, that means \\(|x_m - x_n|^p < \\epsilon\\), which is the same as \\(|x_m - x_n| < \\epsilon^{1/p}\\).\n\nNow, I know that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with the standard metric \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|\\) is complete. So, perhaps I can relate the Cauchy sequences in this metric to the standard Cauchy sequences.\n\nLet's consider a sequence \\((x_n)\\) that is Cauchy in the metric \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\). I need to show that this sequence converges to some limit in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nFirst, let's see if \\((x_n)\\) is also Cauchy in the standard metric. Given that \\(d(x_m, x_n) = |x_m - x_n|^p < \\epsilon\\), if \\(p > 1\\), then \\(|x_m - x_n| < \\epsilon^{1/p}\\). Since \\(\\epsilon^{1/p}\\) can be made arbitrarily small as \\(\\epsilon\\) decreases, this suggests that \\((x_n)\\) is Cauchy in the standard metric as well.\n\nSimilarly, if \\(0 < p < 1\\), \\(|x_m - x_n|^p\\) still approaches 0 as \\(m, n\\) increase, because \\(|x_m - x_n|\\) approaches 0. So, in both cases, \\(p > 1\\) and \\(0 < p < 1\\), the sequence being Cauchy in \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\) implies it's Cauchy in the standard metric.\n\nSince \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is complete with the standard metric, any Cauchy sequence in the standard metric converges to a limit in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Therefore, if \\((x_n)\\) is Cauchy in \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\), it's also Cauchy in the standard metric, and thus converges to some \\(L \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with respect to the standard metric.\n\nNow, I need to show that this sequence also converges to \\(L\\) with respect to the metric \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\). That is, I need to show that for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists \\(N\\) such that for all \\(n > N\\), \\(d(x_n, L) = |x_n - L|^p < \\epsilon\\).\n\nBut since \\((x_n)\\) converges to \\(L\\) in the standard metric, for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists \\(N\\) such that for all \\(n > N\\), \\(|x_n - L| < \\epsilon^{1/p}\\). Raising both sides to the power of \\(p\\), we get \\(|x_n - L|^p < \\epsilon\\), which is exactly what we need to show that \\(x_n \\to L\\) in the metric \\(d\\).\n\nTherefore, every Cauchy sequence in \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) converges to a limit in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), which means that this metric space is complete.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything special about \\(p > 0\\) that I should consider? For example, if \\(p = 1\\), then \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|\\), which is just the standard metric, and we know \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is complete in that case. For \\(p \\neq 1\\), the metric changes, but as I've shown, the Cauchy sequences in this metric are also Cauchy in the standard metric, and hence converge.\n\nIs there any edge case or specific value of \\(p\\) that might cause issues? For instance, if \\(p < 1\\), the metric \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\) still satisfies the properties of a metric: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and the triangle inequality. The only tricky part might be verifying the triangle inequality for \\(p < 1\\), but I believe it holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the equivalence of Cauchy sequences in these metrics. If two metrics are equivalent, then completeness in one implies completeness in the other. But in this case, I'm not sure if these metrics are equivalent in the topological sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the identity function between \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) and \\((\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)\\) and check if it's a homeomorphism, which would preserve completeness.\n\nWait, but \\((\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)\\) is complete, and if the identity map is a homeomorphism, then \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) would also be complete. So, is the identity map a homeomorphism between these two metric spaces?\n\nTo check if the identity map is a homeomorphism, I need to see if it's continuous in both directions.\n\nFirst, let's see if the identity map \\(id: (\\mathbb{R}, d) \\to (\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)\\) is continuous. This means that for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists \\(\\delta > 0\\) such that if \\(d(x, y) < \\delta\\), then \\(|x - y| < \\epsilon\\).\n\nGiven \\(d(x, y) = |x - y|^p < \\delta\\), then \\(|x - y| < \\delta^{1/p}\\). So, to make \\(|x - y| < \\epsilon\\), I can choose \\(\\delta = \\epsilon^p\\). Then, \\(d(x, y) < \\epsilon^p\\) implies \\(|x - y| < \\epsilon\\). Therefore, the identity map is continuous.\n\nNow, check if the inverse identity map \\(id: (\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|) \\to (\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) is continuous. This means that for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists \\(\\delta > 0\\) such that if \\(|x - y| < \\delta\\), then \\(d(x, y) < \\epsilon\\).\n\nGiven \\(|x - y| < \\delta\\), then \\(d(x, y) = |x - y|^p < \\delta^p\\). To make \\(d(x, y) < \\epsilon\\), I can choose \\(\\delta = \\epsilon^{1/p}\\). Then, \\(|x - y| < \\epsilon^{1/p}\\) implies \\(d(x, y) < \\epsilon\\). Therefore, the inverse identity map is also continuous.\n\nSince both the identity map and its inverse are continuous, the identity map is a homeomorphism between \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) and \\((\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)\\). Hence, they have the same topological properties, including completeness.\n\nTherefore, since \\((\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)\\) is complete, \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) is also complete.\n\nWait, but is this argument sufficient? I feel like I might be missing something. Maybe I should directly work with the Cauchy sequences without invoking homeomorphism.\n\nLet me try that approach again. Take a Cauchy sequence in \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\), i.e., for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists \\(N\\) such that for all \\(m, n > N\\), \\(d(x_m, x_n) = |x_m - x_n|^p < \\epsilon\\).\n\nI need to show that this sequence converges in \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\).\n\nFirst, observe that if \\(p > 0\\), then \\(|x_m - x_n| < \\epsilon^{1/p}\\) for \\(m, n > N\\). This means that \\((x_n)\\) is also Cauchy in the standard metric \\(|\\cdot|\\), because for any \\(\\epsilon' > 0\\), choosing \\(\\epsilon = (\\epsilon')^p\\) gives \\(|x_m - x_n| < \\epsilon'\\) for \\(m, n > N\\).\n\nSince \\((\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)\\) is complete, \\((x_n)\\) converges to some \\(L \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) in the standard metric.\n\nNow, I need to show that \\((x_n)\\) converges to \\(L\\) in the metric \\(d\\), i.e., \\(d(x_n, L) = |x_n - L|^p \\to 0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\nBut since \\(x_n \\to L\\) in the standard metric, \\(|x_n - L| \\to 0\\), and therefore \\(|x_n - L|^p \\to 0^p = 0\\). Hence, \\(d(x_n, L) \\to 0\\), which means \\(x_n \\to L\\) in the metric \\(d\\).\n\nTherefore, every Cauchy sequence in \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) converges to a limit in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), proving that the space is complete.\n\nI think this direct approach is clearer and more straightforward. The homeomorphism argument works, but it might be considered a higher-level abstraction, whereas the Cauchy sequence approach is more fundamental and directly addresses the completeness property.\n\nIs there any scenario where this argument breaks down? For example, if \\(p = 0\\), but the problem specifies \\(p > 0\\), so that's fine. Also, for \\(p = 1\\), it's just the standard metric, which we already know is complete.\n\nWait, but for \\(p > 0\\), is there any issue with the metric properties? For instance, does \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\) satisfy the triangle inequality? Let's verify that quickly.\n\nThe triangle inequality states that \\(d(x,z) \\leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)\\) for all \\(x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nSo, \\(|x - z|^p \\leq |x - y|^p + |y - z|^p\\).\n\nIs this true for all \\(p > 0\\)?\n\nFor \\(p \\geq 1\\), the function \\(f(t) = t^p\\) is convex, and in this case, the inequality holds due to Minkowski's inequality for norms.\n\nFor \\(0 < p < 1\\), \\(f(t) = t^p\\) is concave, and in this case, the inequality still holds because of the concavity. Specifically, for concave functions, \\((a + b)^p \\geq a^p + b^p\\) for \\(a, b \\geq 0\\), but in this context, we need to verify that \\(|x - z|^p \\leq |x - y|^p + |y - z|^p\\).\n\nActually, for \\(0 < p < 1\\), the triangle inequality holds for the metric \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\), but the space becomes no longer a normed space because the \"norm\" doesn't satisfy the usual triangle inequality. However, it's still a valid metric space.\n\nGiven that, my earlier argument should hold for all \\(p > 0\\), and the space \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) is complete.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the case when \\(p < 1\\). In this case, the metric \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\) is known as a snowflake metric, and it's known that such metrics can have different properties compared to the standard metric.\n\nHowever, in this particular case, since we've established that Cauchy sequences in \\(d\\) are also Cauchy in the standard metric, and since \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is complete in the standard metric, the conclusion follows.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider a more general setting, say a different metric space, this argument might not hold, but in this specific case, it seems to work.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently conclude that the metric space \\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\), where \\(d(x,y) = |x - y|^p\\) for some \\(p > 0\\), is complete.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{The metric space } (\\mathbb{R}, d) \\text{ with } d(x,y) = |x - y|^p \\text{ for } p > 0 \\text{ is complete.}}\\]"
