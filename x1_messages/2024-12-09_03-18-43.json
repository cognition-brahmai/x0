        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have bags containing either 4 or 7 candies, and the goal is to get exactly 23 candies. I need to figure out how many of each type of bag to buy.\n\nFirst, let's define variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- \\( x \\) is the number of 4-candy bags.\n\n- \\( y \\) is the number of 7-candy bags.\n\nThe total number of candies will be \\( 4x + 7y \\), and we want this to equal 23. So, the equation is:\n\n\\[ 4x + 7y = 23 \\]\n\nNow, since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent the number of bags, they have to be non-negative integers (you can't buy a negative number of bags or a fraction of a bag). So, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers greater than or equal to zero.\n\nMy task is to find integer values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nOne approach is to try different values for \\( y \\) and see what \\( x \\) would have to be in each case.\n\nLet's start with \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 4x + 7(0) = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \\]\n\nBut \\( x \\) has to be an integer, so this isn't a valid solution.\n\nNext, \\( y = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ 4x + 7(1) = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x + 7 = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nThis gives \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\), which are both integers. So, this is a possible solution.\n\nLet's check if there are other solutions by trying \\( y = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ 4x + 7(2) = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x + 14 = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x = 9 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( x \\) is not an integer, so this isn't valid.\n\nNow, \\( y = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ 4x + 7(3) = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x + 21 = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \\]\n\nNot an integer.\n\nIf I try \\( y = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ 4x + 7(4) = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x + 28 = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x = -5 \\]\n\n\\[ x = -\\frac{5}{4} \\]\n\nThis is negative, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, the only solution where both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are non-negative integers is \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\).\n\nBut let's double-check if there are other possible combinations I might have missed. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAnother method is to consider the equation modulo 4 or 7 to see if there are multiple solutions.\n\nLet's consider the equation modulo 4:\n\n\\[ 4x + 7y \\equiv 23 \\pmod{4} \\]\n\nSince \\( 4x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\) and \\( 7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\), this becomes:\n\n\\[ 0 + 3y \\equiv 23 \\pmod{4} \\]\n\n\\[ 3y \\equiv 23 \\pmod{4} \\]\n\n\\[ 3y \\equiv 23 - 5*4 = 23 - 20 = 3 \\pmod{4} \\]\n\n\\[ 3y \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3 (since 3 and 4 are coprime, this is allowed):\n\n\\[ y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\]\n\nThis means that \\( y = 1 + 4k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nNow, plugging back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ 4x + 7(1 + 4k) = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x + 7 + 28k = 23 \\]\n\n\\[ 4x = 23 - 7 - 28k \\]\n\n\\[ 4x = 16 - 28k \\]\n\n\\[ x = 4 - 7k \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, \\( 4 - 7k \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( k \\leq \\frac{4}{7} \\). Since \\( k \\) is an integer, possible values are \\( k = 0 \\) and \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nFor \\( k = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ x = 4 - 7(0) = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 1 + 4(0) = 1 \\]\n\nThis matches the solution I found earlier.\n\nFor \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ x = 4 - 7(1) = -3 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 1 + 4(1) = 5 \\]\n\nBut \\( x = -3 \\) is negative, which isn't allowed. So, the only valid solution is \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the customer should purchase 4 bags of 4 candies and 1 bag of 7 candies to get exactly 23 candies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ bags of 4 candies and } 1 \\text{ bag of 7 candies}} \\]"
