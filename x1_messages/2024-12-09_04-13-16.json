        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many employees currently work remotely. The company has 120 employees, and 30% of them work remotely. So, we calculate 30% of 120 to find the current number of remote workers.\n\nTo calculate 30% of 120, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of remote workers} = \\frac{30}{100} \\times 120\n\\]\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{100} = 0.3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.3 \\times 120 = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, currently, there are 36 remote workers.\n\nNow, the company decides to increase its remote workforce by 50%. We need to find out what 50% of the current remote workers is and then add that to the current number to find the new total.\n\nFirst, calculate 50% of 36:\n\n\\[\n50\\% \\text{ of } 36 = \\frac{50}{100} \\times 36 = 0.5 \\times 36 = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, they want to increase the remote workforce by 18 employees.\n\nNow, add that to the current number of remote workers:\n\n\\[\n36 + 18 = 54\n\\]\n\nTherefore, after the change, there will be 54 employees working remotely.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 120 employees, 30% work remotely, which is 36 employees. Increasing that by 50% means adding half of 36, which is 18, so 36 plus 18 equals 54. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that to increase a number by a certain percentage, you can multiply the original number by (1 + the percentage increase in decimal form). So, in this case, to increase 36 by 50%, I could calculate:\n\n\\[\n36 \\times (1 + 0.5) = 36 \\times 1.5 = 54\n\\]\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 54 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the increase is based on the total number of employees rather than the current number of remote workers. But no, the problem says \"increase its remote workforce by 50%,\" which clearly refers to the current remote workforce, not the total number of employees.\n\nSo, the final answer is 54 employees working remotely after the change.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
