        "content": "Redshift in astronomy refers to the displacement of spectral lines towards longer wavelengths in radiation from distant galaxies and celestial bodies. So, the correct answer is A.\n\nBut let's dive deeper into what redshift really means and why it's so important in astronomy.\n\nFirst off, redshift is a key piece of evidence for the expansion of the universe. It was discovered by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s when he observed that galaxies outside our own Milky Way were moving away from us, and the farther away they were, the faster they were receding. This relationship between a galaxy's distance and its recession speed is now known as Hubble's Law.\n\nSo, how does redshift happen? It's similar to the Doppler effect you might have heard of with sound. When a source of sound moves away from you, the sound waves get stretched out, making the pitch lower. Similarly, when a light source moves away from us, the light waves get stretched out, shifting the light towards the red end of the spectrum\u2014hence the term \"redshift.\"\n\nConversely, if a light source is moving towards us, the light waves are compressed, shifting the light towards the blue end of the spectrum. This is called blueshift.\n\nRedshift is denoted by the letter 'z,' and it's calculated by measuring the difference between the observed wavelength and the expected (rest) wavelength of a spectral line, divided by the rest wavelength.\n\nSo, z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength.\n\nA positive z value indicates redshift (moving away), while a negative z value indicates blueshift (moving towards the observer).\n\nRedshift is incredibly useful for determining distances to faraway galaxies because of Hubble's Law, which states that velocity (which we get from redshift) is proportional to distance.\n\nMoreover, redshift can also tell us about the age of the universe. The more redshifted a galaxy is, the farther back in time we are seeing it, since the light has taken longer to reach us.\n\nThere are different types of redshift:\n\n1. **Doppler redshift:** Due to the motion of the source relative to the observer.\n\n2. **Gravitational redshift:** Due to the gravitational field of a massive object, which can stretch light waves as they escape the gravity.\n\n3. **Cosmological redshift:** Due to the expansion of the universe itself, which causes the space between galaxies to stretch.\n\nIt's important to note that cosmological redshift is not due to the galaxies moving through space but because the space itself is expanding.\n\nRedshift has been crucial in understanding the history and structure of the universe. For example, by studying the redshifts of distant supernovae, astronomers discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, leading to the concept of dark energy.\n\nSo, in summary, redshift is a fundamental concept in astronomy that helps us understand the movement of celestial objects, the expansion of the universe, and even the nature of dark energy.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Redshift is the displacement of spectral lines towards longer wavelengths.\n\n- It's evidence for the expansion of the universe.\n\n- Different types include Doppler, gravitational, and cosmological redshift.\n\n- Used to determine distances and understand the universe's history.\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n- Hubble's Law\n\n- Doppler Effect\n\n- Cosmic Microwave Background\n\n- Dark Energy\n\n**References:**\n\n- \"An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics\" by Bradley W.
