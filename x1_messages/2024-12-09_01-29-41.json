        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden has a length of 20 meters and a width of 12 meters, and I need to find out what the area of the garden is in square meters. Alright, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. That's a basic formula I learned in geometry. So, if the length is 20 meters and the width is 12 meters, I just need to multiply these two numbers together to get the area in square meters.\n\nLet me write that down: area = length \u00d7 width = 20 m \u00d7 12 m.\n\nNow, multiplying 20 by 12. Well, 20 times 10 is 200, and 20 times 2 is 40, so altogether that's 200 plus 40, which equals 240. So, the area should be 240 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to check this? Maybe I can think about breaking down the rectangle into smaller parts. For example, I can imagine the garden as being divided into two parts: one that's 20 meters by 10 meters and another that's 20 meters by 2 meters. Then, the area of the first part would be 20 times 10, which is 200 square meters, and the area of the second part would be 20 times 2, which is 40 square meters. Adding those together gives me again 240 square meters. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the dimensions differently. Maybe use the formula for the area of a rectangle in terms of its diagonals or something, but I don't think that's necessary here since the straightforward method seems to work just fine.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something? Like, maybe the garden isn't a perfect rectangle, or perhaps there are some parts that are missing or additional areas to consider. But according to the problem, it's a rectangular garden with given length and width, so I think I'm safe sticking with the basic area formula.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. The length is in meters and the width is in meters, so when I multiply them, I get square meters, which is the correct unit for area. So, that checks out.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes. Multiplying 20 by 12 is pretty straightforward, but to double-check: 20 times 12 is 240. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the perimeter or something, but no, the perimeter isn't asked for; it's the area that's needed. So, sticking with the area formula is the way to go.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The problem is straightforward, and my calculation seems correct. So, the area of the garden is 240 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
