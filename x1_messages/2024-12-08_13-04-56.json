        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a farmer with 30 animals, which are either chickens or cows, and together they have 90 legs. We need to find out how many chickens there are.\n\nFirst, I know that chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, if we let's say all 30 animals were chickens, then there would be 30 times 2, which is 60 legs in total. But the farmer counts 90 legs, which is 30 legs more than 60.\n\nNow, if we replace some chickens with cows, each cow would add 2 extra legs compared to a chicken because cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2. So, for each chicken replaced by a cow, we gain 2 legs.\n\nSince we need 30 extra legs, we can calculate how many cows there are by dividing the extra legs needed by the extra legs each cow provides. That is, 30 extra legs divided by 2 extra legs per cow equals 15 cows.\n\nSo, if there are 15 cows, then the number of chickens would be the total number of animals minus the number of cows, which is 30 minus 15, equaling 15 chickens.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this makes sense. If there are 15 cows with 4 legs each, that's 15 times 4 equals 60 legs. And 15 chickens with 2 legs each is 15 times 2 equals 30 legs. Adding those together, 60 plus 30 equals 90 legs, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, it seems like there are 15 chickens on the farm.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up equations to solve this more formally. Let\u2019s denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K. We know that:\n\nC + K = 30 (since there are 30 animals in total)\n\nAnd\n\n2C + 4K = 90 (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4, and total legs are 90)\n\nNow, I can solve these equations simultaneously. From the first equation, I can express C in terms of K:\n\nC = 30 - K\n\nThen, plug this into the second equation:\n\n2(30 - K) + 4K = 90\n\nSimplify:\n\n60 - 2K + 4K = 90\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n60 + 2K = 90\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n2K = 30\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nK = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 cows. Now, plug back into the first equation to find C:\n\nC = 30 - 15 = 15\n\nAgain, this suggests there are 15 chickens.\n\nWait a minute, but the initial quick method and the formal equation method both give me 15 chickens. But I recall that in such problems, sometimes there's a different approach, maybe using ratios or something else.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I consider the difference in legs. Each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken. So, the total number of extra legs is 90 - the minimum possible legs if all were chickens.\n\nThe minimum legs if all were chickens would be 30 times 2, which is 60 legs. The actual total is 90 legs, so there are 90 - 60 = 30 extra legs.\n\nSince each cow adds 2 extra legs, the number of cows is 30 extra legs divided by 2 extra legs per cow, which is 15 cows.\n\nThus, the number of chickens is 30 - 15 = 15.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of the average number of legs per animal, the average is 90 legs divided by 30 animals, which is 3 legs per animal.\n\nNow, since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4, the average of 3 suggests a mix where the number of cows to chickens is in a certain ratio.\n\nSpecifically, the ratio of cows to chickens would be (average - chicken legs) to (cow legs - average), which is (3 - 2) to (4 - 3), so 1:1.\n\nTherefore, the number of cows equals the number of chickens, which again points to 15 of each.\n\nAll these different approaches are leading me to the same conclusion: there are 15 chickens and 15 cows.\n\nBut let's double-check with another method. Suppose I use the concept of weighted averages.\n\nLet C be the number of chickens and K be the number of cows.\n\nWe have C + K = 30\n\nAnd (2C + 4K) / 30 = 3 (since the average is 3 legs per animal)\n\nSo, 2C + 4K = 90\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that for every chicken, it brings the average down by 1 leg (from 4 to 3), and for every cow, it brings the average up by 1 leg (from 2 to 3).\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the best way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the difference between the number of cows and chickens is related to the total legs.\n\nBut honestly, I think the initial methods are sufficient and consistent.\n\nPerhaps I can also consider creating a table to see the possible combinations.\n\nLet's make a small table:\n\n- If there are 0 cows and 30 chickens: 0*4 + 30*2 = 60 legs\n\n- If there are 5 cows and 25 chickens: 5*4 + 25*2 = 20 + 50 = 70 legs\n\n- 10 cows and 20 chickens: 40 + 40 = 80 legs\n\n- 15 cows and 15 chickens: 60 + 30 = 90 legs\n\nAh, there we go again, 15 cows and 15 chickens give us the required 90 legs.\n\nAlternatively, if there were 20 cows and 10 chickens: 80 + 20 = 100 legs, which is too many.\n\nSo, indeed, 15 chickens seem to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, but the problem asks for the number of chickens, and according to all these methods, it's 15.\n\nHowever, maybe I should consider if there could be other possibilities. For example, if there were different numbers of animals or different leg counts.\n\nBut according to the given numbers, it seems consistent that there are 15 chickens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the farmer has some other types of animals, but the problem specifies only chickens and cows.\n\nSo, I don't think there are other variables to consider.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total number of legs if all were cows: 30*4=120 legs, which is more than the actual total of 90 legs.\n\nThen, for each cow replaced by a chicken, we reduce the total legs by 2.\n\nSo, starting from 120 legs, we need to reduce by 30 legs to reach 90.\n\nEach chicken replaces a cow and reduces legs by 2, so 30 reduction / 2 per chicken = 15 chickens.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep arriving at 15 chickens.\n\nTherefore, the farmer has 15 chickens on his farm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
