The expression is (6 / 2) * (9 - 3) + 10 / 2.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n(6 / 2) and (9 - 3)\n\nLet's calculate inside the parentheses first.\n\n6 divided by 2 is 3.\n\n9 minus 3 is 6.\n\nSo now the expression becomes: 3 * 6 + 10 / 2.\n\nNext, multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, 3 multiplied by 6 is 18.\n\nThen, 10 divided by 2 is 5.\n\nNow the expression is: 18 + 5.\n\nFinally, addition: 18 plus 5 equals 23.\n\nSo, the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]"
