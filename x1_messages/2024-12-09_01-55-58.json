Then, it should sort those words alphabetically and print them out along with their frequencies. Sounds straightforward. Let's break this down into steps.\n\nFirst, we need to read the content of a text file. In Java, we can use various classes to handle file I/O, but for simplicity, we'll use the `BufferedReader` class with `InputStreamReader` to read the file line by line. We'll assume that the file path is provided as a command-line argument.\n\nNext, we need to split the text into words. We can do this by using the `split` method on each line, using spaces or other delimiters like punctuation marks.\n\nThen, we'll count the frequency of each word. For this, a `HashMap` is perfect because it allows us to store each unique word as a key and its frequency as the value.\n\nAfter reading and counting all the words, we need to sort them alphabetically. Since HashMaps don't maintain any order, we'll need to transfer the keys to a list and sort that list.\n\nFinally, we'll iterate through the sorted list and print each word along with its frequency.\n\nLet me think about potential issues. We need to handle cases where the file doesn't exist or can't be read. Also, we should consider that words might have different cases (e.g., \"Word\" and \"word\"), so we might want to convert all words to lowercase to count them as the same word.\n\nAlso, we should handle punctuation. For example, \"word,\" and \"word\" should be considered the same word. So, we might need to remove punctuation from the words.\n\nLet's sketch a rough plan:\n\n1. Check if the file path is provided as a command-line argument.\n\n2. Open the file using `BufferedReader`.\n\n3. Read the file line by line.\n\n4. For each line, split it into words using space and punctuation as delimiters.\n\n5. Convert each word to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n\n6. Remove punctuation from the words.\n\n7. Use a `HashMap` to count the frequency of each word.\n\n8. Collect the keys (words) into a list and sort it alphabetically.\n\n9. Iterate through the sorted list and print each word with its frequency.\n\nAlright, now let's think about the code structure. We'll probably have a `main` method that handles the file reading and processing. We'll need to handle exceptions properly, especially `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException`.\n\nFor splitting the words, we can use the `split` method with a regular expression that matches spaces and punctuation.\n\nFor sorting, we'll use the `Collections.sort()` method on the list of words.\n\nLet me consider writing a helper method to clean the words, like removing punctuation and converting to lowercase.\n\nAlso, we should consider that very large files might not fit into memory if we read the entire file at once, but since we're reading line by line, it should be manageable.\n\nI should also think about Stop words, but for this task, I don't think we need to remove them unless specified.\n\nAlright, let's start writing some pseudocode.\n\n```\n\nRead file path from command line arguments\n\nOpen file using BufferedReader\n\nInitialize HashMap for word frequencies\n\nInitialize StringBuilder for reading file content\n\nRead file line by line\n\nFor each line:\n\nRemove punctuation\n\nConvert to lowercase\n\nSplit into words\n\nFor each word:\n\nIf it exists in HashMap, increment count\n\nElse, add it with count 1\n\nClose the file\n\nGet set of unique words from HashMap\n\nSort the words alphabetically\n\nPrint each word and its frequency\n\n```\n\nThat seems like a good plan. Now, let's think about the implementation details.\n\nFirst, reading the file path from command-line arguments:\n\nWe can access command-line arguments using `String[] args` in the `main` method.\n\nWe should check if exactly one argument is provided; otherwise, print an error message.\n\nNext, opening the file:\n\nUse `new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(filePath)))`\n\nBut to handle different character encodings, it's better to use `Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(filePath), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`\n\nWe'll need to import `java.nio.file.*` for this.\n\nReading line by line:\n\nUse a loop that reads lines until null is returned.\n\nFor cleaning the words:\n\nWe can use `line.toLowerCase()` to convert to lowercase.\n\nTo remove punctuation, we can use `line.replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s]\", \"\")`\n\nThis regular expression replaces any character that's not a letter, number, or whitespace with an empty string.\n\nThen, split the line into words using `line.split(\"\\\\s+\")`, which splits on one or more whitespace characters.\n\nStoring in HashMap:\n\nUse `map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1)`\n\nAfter reading all lines, get the set of keys from the map.\n\nConvert the set to a list and sort it.\n\nFinally, iterate through the sorted list and print each word and its frequency.\n\nLet me think about error handling.\n\nWe should handle `IOException` in case the file doesn't exist or can't be read.\n\nWe can use a try-catch block to catch `IOException` and print an error message.\n\nAlso, we should ensure that the file path is correct and provided.\n\nNow, let's think about testing.\n\nWe should have a sample text file to test the program.\n\nFor example, create a text file named \"sample.txt\" with some content.\n\nRun the program with this file and check if the word frequencies are correctly counted and printed alphabetically.\n\nWe should also test with files that have different cases and punctuation to ensure that the program handles them correctly.\n\nAlright, I think I have a good plan now. Let's start writing the code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Java program that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word in the file. The output should be sorted alphabetically and printed to the console.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading the File**: We use `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line.\n2. **Processing Words**: Each line is converted to lowercase and punctuation is removed. Words are then split using whitespace as delimiters.\n3. **Counting Frequencies**: We use a `HashMap` to count the frequency of each word.\n4. **Sorting and Printing**: The words are retrieved from the map, sorted alphabetically, and then printed along with their frequencies.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class WordFrequencyCounter {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length != 1) {\n            System.out.println(\"Usage: java WordFrequencyCounter <file_path>\");\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        String filePath = args[0];\n        Map<String, Integer> wordCountMap = new HashMap<>();\n        \n        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(filePath), \"UTF-8\"))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                // Remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and split into words\n                String[] words = line.replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s]\", \"\").toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\s+\");\n                for (String word : words) {\n                    if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n                        wordCountMap.put(word, wordCountMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"An error occurred while reading the file: \" + e.getMessage());\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        // Retrieve keys and sort them alphabetically\n        List<String> words = new ArrayList<>(wordCountMap.keySet());\n        Collections.sort(words);\n        \n        // Print sorted words and their frequencies\n        for (String word : words) {\n            System.out.println(word + \" : \" + wordCountMap.get(word));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the File**: The file path is taken from the command-line arguments. We use `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line.\n2. **Processing Words**: For each line, we remove punctuation using `replaceAll`, convert to lowercase, and split into words using whitespace as the delimiter.\n3. **Counting Frequencies**: We use a `HashMap` to keep track of the frequency of each word. For each word, we update its count in the map.\n4. **Sorting and Printing**: We retrieve the list of unique words from the map, sort them alphabetically, and then print each word along with its frequency.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program is efficient and handles basic text processing tasks effectively."
