The company estimates that they will sell 10,000 units per month and has a production capacity of 12,000 units per month. Each unit requires 2 hours of labor to produce, and the company has a workforce of 100 employees working 40-hour weeks. Calculate the number of additional employees needed to meet production goals while maintaining a reasonable workload for existing employees. Explain your reasoning."

        "content": "To determine the number of additional employees needed to meet the production goals while maintaining a reasonable workload for existing employees, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total production required per month:**\n   The company estimates selling 10,000 units per month and has a production capacity of 12,000 units per month. However, to meet the demand, they need to produce at least 10,000 units per month.\n\n2. **Determine the total labor hours required to produce the required units:**\n   Each unit requires 2 hours of labor to produce.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total labor hours required} = \\text{Number of units} \\times \\text{Labor hours per unit}\n   \\]\n   For 10,000 units:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total labor hours required} = 10,000 \\times 2 = 20,000 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total available labor hours from existing employees:**\n   The company has 100 employees, each working 40-hour weeks. Assuming 4 weeks per month:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly labor hours per employee} = 40 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly labor hours per employee} = 40 \\times 4 = 160 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total monthly labor hours from existing employees} = 100 \\times 160 = 16,000 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the shortfall in labor hours:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shortfall} = \\text{Total labor hours required} - \\text{Total monthly labor hours from existing employees}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shortfall} = 20,000 - 16,000 = 4,000 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of additional employees needed:**\n   Each additional employee can provide 160 hours per month.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of additional employees} = \\frac{\\text{Shortfall}}{\\text{Monthly labor hours per employee}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of additional employees} = \\frac{4,000}{160} = 25\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the company needs to hire 25 additional employees to meet the production goal of 10,000 units per month while maintaining a reasonable workload for existing employees.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- We first determined the total labor hours needed to produce the required number of units.\n- Then, we calculated the total labor hours that can be provided by the existing workforce.\n- By finding the difference between the required and available labor hours, we determined the shortfall.\n- Finally, we calculated the number of additional employees needed based on the monthly labor hours each new employee can contribute.\n\nThis approach ensures that the company meets its production targets without overburdening the existing workforce."
