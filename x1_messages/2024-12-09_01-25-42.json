        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in the room. Half of them are wearing glasses, so that means 50 people are wearing glasses. One-third of the total number are wearing hats, so that would be 100 divided by 3, which is approximately 33.33, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, let's assume it's 33 people wearing hats.\n\nNow, the problem says that everyone wearing a hat is also wearing glasses. So, all 33 hat wearers are included in the 50 people wearing glasses.\n\nI need to find out how many people are wearing only glasses, meaning they have glasses but no hat.\n\nSince 33 people are wearing both glasses and hats, I can subtract that number from the total number of glasses wearers to find those wearing only glasses.\n\nSo, 50 (glasses wearers) minus 33 (both glasses and hats) equals 17 people wearing only glasses.\n\nWait a minute, but 100 divided by 3 is exactly 33.333..., and since we can't have a fraction of a person, maybe the problem expects us to round down to 33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number is such that one-third is exactly 33. Let me check: 33 times 3 is 99, so 100 minus 99 is 1, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider exact divisions, but since 100 isn't perfectly divisible by 3, perhaps it's better to consider it as 33 people wearing hats.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that all hat wearers also wear glasses, then the number of people wearing only glasses would be the total glasses wearers minus the hat wearers, which is 50 - 33 = 17.\n\nSo, the answer should be 17 people wearing only glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
