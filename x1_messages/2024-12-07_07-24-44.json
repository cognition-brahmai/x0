Each step of your plan should correspond with an evidence variable that will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string, which can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to you:\nBing[input]: This tool allows the user to search for information using the Bing search engine. It is useful in finding sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nHTMLParser[input]: This tool extracts plain text from HTML content. The input must be HTML content and it produces plain text as output.\nURLCollector[input]: This tool collects URLs from plain text and produces a list of newline delimited links.\nDeepQA[input]: A deep learning based question answering model. Useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?"
