        "content": "So I have this problem: find the area enclosed by the polar curve r equals 4 sine theta. Okay, polar coordinates can be a bit tricky for me, but let's see. I remember that in polar coordinates, the position of a point is determined by its distance from the origin, which is r, and the angle from the positive x-axis, which is theta.\n\nSo, the equation is r = 4 sin \u03b8. First, I should probably understand what this curve looks like. I know that in polar coordinates, sine functions often produce circles or parts of circles. Let me try to convert this equation to Cartesian coordinates to see if that helps.\n\nI recall that r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) and y = r sin \u03b8. Hmm, maybe I can manipulate the equation to express it in terms of x and y. Let's see:\n\nGiven r = 4 sin \u03b8,\n\nMultiply both sides by r:\n\nr\u00b2 = 4 r sin \u03b8\n\nNow, r\u00b2 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, and r sin \u03b8 is y:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 4y\n\nThat seems simpler. Let me rearrange this:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 4y = 0\n\nI think I can complete the square for the y terms. To complete the square for y\u00b2 - 4y, I take half of the coefficient of y, which is -4, half of that is -2, and square it to get 4. So, adding and subtracting 4:\n\nx\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 - 4y + 4) - 4 = 0\n\nx\u00b2 + (y - 2)\u00b2 - 4 = 0\n\nx\u00b2 + (y - 2)\u00b2 = 4\n\nAh, this is the equation of a circle with center at (0, 2) and radius 2.\n\nSo, the polar curve r = 4 sin \u03b8 is a circle centered at (0, 2) with radius 2.\n\nNow, to find the area enclosed by this curve, since it's a circle, I know the area of a circle is \u03c0 r\u00b2. So, area should be \u03c0 times 2 squared, which is 4\u03c0.\n\nBut wait, let's see if that makes sense in polar coordinates. I should probably derive this using polar coordinate integration to confirm.\n\nI recall that the area in polar coordinates is given by the integral from alpha to beta of (1/2) r\u00b2 d\u03b8, where alpha and beta are the bounds for theta.\n\nSo, for r = 4 sin \u03b8, I need to find the bounds for \u03b8 where the curve is traced out.\n\nLet's see, in the circle equation, theta probably goes from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nBut, let's see where r = 4 sin \u03b8 is defined.\n\nSin \u03b8 is defined for all \u03b8, but r can be negative, which in polar coordinates means the point is reflected through the origin.\n\nBut, for area, r squared will be positive anyway.\n\nLet me plot some points to see the behavior.\n\nWhen \u03b8 = 0:\n\nr = 4 sin 0 = 0\n\nWhen \u03b8 = \u03c0/2:\n\nr = 4 sin (\u03c0/2) = 4\n\nWhen \u03b8 = \u03c0:\n\nr = 4 sin \u03c0 = 0\n\nWhen \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2:\n\nr = 4 sin (3\u03c0/2) = -4\n\nWait, negative r means it's plotted in the opposite direction.\n\nSo, from \u03b8 = 0 to \u03b8 = \u03c0, r goes from 0 to 4 and back to 0.\n\nFrom \u03b8 = \u03c0 to \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, r goes from 0 to -4 and back to 0.\n\nBut since r is squared in the area formula, the negative doesn't affect the area.\n\nSo, to cover the entire area once, perhaps integrating from 0 to \u03c0 would be sufficient, since from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0, it traces the same area again.\n\nWait, but in the circle we saw earlier, it's symmetric about the y-axis, so integrating from 0 to \u03c0 should cover the entire area.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nSo, area A = \u222b from 0 to \u03c0 (1/2) r\u00b2 d\u03b8\n\nWith r = 4 sin \u03b8,\n\nA = \u222b from 0 to \u03c0 (1/2) (4 sin \u03b8)\u00b2 d\u03b8\n\n= \u222b from 0 to \u03c0 (1/2) (16 sin\u00b2 \u03b8) d\u03b8\n\n= \u222b from 0 to \u03c0 8 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nNow, I need to integrate 8 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nI recall that sin\u00b2 \u03b8 can be rewritten using the identity sin\u00b2 \u03b8 = (1 - cos 2\u03b8)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nA = \u222b from 0 to \u03c0 8 * (1 - cos 2\u03b8)/2 d\u03b8\n\n= \u222b from 0 to \u03c0 4 (1 - cos 2\u03b8) d\u03b8\n\n= 4 \u222b from 0 to \u03c0 (1 - cos 2\u03b8) d\u03b8\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\nIntegral of 1 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 is \u03b8 evaluated from 0 to \u03c0, which is \u03c0.\n\nIntegral of cos 2\u03b8 d\u03b8 is (1/2) sin 2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\nA = 4 [ \u03c0 - (1/2) sin 2\u03b8 ] from 0 to \u03c0\n\nEvaluate at \u03b8 = \u03c0:\n\n1/2 sin (2\u03c0) = 0\n\nEvaluate at \u03b8 = 0:\n\n1/2 sin (0) = 0\n\nSo, A = 4 [ \u03c0 - 0 - (0) ] = 4\u03c0\n\nWait, that's the same as the area I got from the circle formula.\n\nBut earlier, I thought integrating from 0 to \u03c0 would cover the entire area, but in reality, the circle is traced out from 0 to \u03c0 and then again from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0, covering the same area twice.\n\nWait, but in polar coordinates, integrating from 0 to 2\u03c0 would cover the entire area, but since the curve is symmetric, integrating from 0 to \u03c0 gives half the area.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in this case, integrating from 0 to \u03c0 gives the entire area once, as the curve traces the circle from \u03b8 = 0 to \u03b8 = \u03c0, and from \u03b8 = \u03c0 to \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, it traces the same area again.\n\nWait, but in the circle equation, it's symmetric about the y-axis, so yes, integrating from 0 to \u03c0 should give the entire area.\n\nBut according to the integral, A = 4\u03c0, which matches the area of the circle.\n\nWait, but the circle has area \u03c0 r\u00b2 = \u03c0 (2)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I integrate from 0 to 2\u03c0, I would get twice that, but since the curve overlaps, it's better to integrate from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nWait, but in polar coordinates, to find the area enclosed by a curve, you integrate over the full period, which in this case is from 0 to \u03c0, as the curve closes up by then.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should integrate from 0 to 2\u03c0 to account for the entire curve.\n\nWait, but doing that would give me A = \u222b from 0 to 2\u03c0 8 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 = 16 \u222b from 0 to \u03c0/2 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8, using symmetry.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me look up the formula for area in polar coordinates again.\n\nYes, the area enclosed by a polar curve r = f(\u03b8) from \u03b8 = a to \u03b8 = b is A = (1/2) \u222b from a to b r\u00b2 d\u03b8.\n\nIn this case, r = 4 sin \u03b8.\n\nI need to determine the bounds a and b such that the curve is traced out exactly once.\n\nLooking at the curve, it starts at \u03b8 = 0, r = 0; reaches \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, r = 4; then \u03b8 = \u03c0, r = 0; \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2, r = -4; and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, r = 0.\n\nBut in polar coordinates, negative r means it's plotted in the opposite direction.\n\nSo, from \u03b8 = 0 to \u03b8 = \u03c0, r goes from 0 to 4 to 0.\n\nFrom \u03b8 = \u03c0 to \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, r goes from 0 to -4 to 0.\n\nBut since r is squared in the area formula, the negative doesn't affect the area.\n\nSo, integrating from 0 to \u03c0 would give the area of the upper half of the circle, and from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0 would give the area of the lower half.\n\nBut in this case, the lower half is just the reflection of the upper half, so the total area is twice the area from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nWait, but earlier, integrating from 0 to \u03c0 gave me 4\u03c0, which is the full area of the circle.\n\nWait, no, if the circle has radius 2, its area should be \u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0.\n\nSo, integrating from 0 to \u03c0 gives 4\u03c0, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, integrating from 0 to 2\u03c0 would give 8\u03c0, but that would be counting the area twice.\n\nBut in reality, the curve traces the circle once from 0 to \u03c0, and again from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0, overlapping.\n\nSo, to find the area enclosed by the curve, I should integrate from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, A = 4\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to integrate from 0 to 2\u03c0, I would get A = 8\u03c0, but that would be double counting the area.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to integrate from 0 to \u03c0, getting A = 4\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the area enclosed by the polar curve r = 4 sin \u03b8 is 4\u03c0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4\\pi} \\]"
