        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A car rental company has 12 cars, and each car is rented out an average of 5 times per month. They charge $50 per rental. I need to find out how much revenue they generate in one year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Revenue is the income the company gets from renting out the cars. So, I need to calculate the total income from all the rentals in one year.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find out how many rentals there are per month.\n\nThere are 12 cars, and each is rented out 5 times a month. So, total rentals per month would be:\n\n12 cars * 5 rentals/car = 60 rentals per month.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the monthly revenue.\n\nEach rental brings in $50, so monthly revenue is:\n\n60 rentals * $50/rental = $3000 per month.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the annual revenue.\n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so yearly revenue would be:\n\n$3000/month * 12 months = $36,000 per year.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of rentals in a year first.\n\nNumber of rentals per car per year: 5 rentals/month * 12 months = 60 rentals/car/year.\n\nTotal rentals for all cars: 12 cars * 60 rentals/car/year = 720 rentals/year.\n\nThen, total revenue: 720 rentals * $50/rental = $36,000 per year.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like, are there any costs or deductions mentioned? Nope, the question only asks for revenue generated from rentals.\n\nAlso, it says \"each car is rented out an average of 5 times per month.\" Does that mean that sometimes a car might be rented more or less than 5 times, but on average, it's 5?\n\nWell, since it's an average, I can use 5 as the standard figure for my calculations.\n\nAlso, the charging rate is $50 per rental. Is there any mention of different rates for different types of cars or different periods? Not that I can see. So, I'll assume it's a flat rate of $50 per rental.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all cars are always available for rental, or if there are times when they're not available, like for maintenance or cleaning.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any downtime for the cars, so I'll assume that all 12 cars are available for rental the entire month.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"each car is rented out an average of 5 times per month.\" Does that imply that sometimes a car might be rented multiple times in a day, or is it one rental per day on average?\n\nActually, the problem doesn't specify the duration of each rental, so I'll assume that the average of 5 rentals per month is the correct figure to use.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the possibility of overlapping rentals. For example, if a car is rented multiple times in a month, does that affect its availability for other rentals?\n\nBut since it's an average, and the problem doesn't provide more details, I'll stick with the given average of 5 rentals per car per month.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nPerhaps using the concept of total rental opportunities.\n\nTotal rental opportunities per month: 12 cars * 5 rentals/car = 60 rentals, as I calculated before.\n\nThen, revenue per month: 60 rentals * $50 = $3000.\n\nAnnual revenue: $3000 * 12 = $36,000.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of total rentals per year: 60 rentals/month * 12 months = 720 rentals/year.\n\nThen, 720 rentals * $50 = $36,000.\n\nHmm, I keep getting the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nIs there any possibility that the number of cars changes over the year? The problem doesn't mention any cars being added or removed, so I'll assume the number stays constant at 12 cars.\n\nAlso, the rental frequency and the rental price are constant, according to the problem.\n\nSo, no need to account for any variations in these figures over time.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue generated in one year is $36,000.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very small amount for a car rental company. Even with just 12 cars, renting them out 5 times a month at $50 per rental.\n\nMaybe I should check if the units are correct.\n\nLet's see: 12 cars * 5 rentals/car/month * $50/rental * 12 months/year.\n\nThat would be: 12 * 5 * 50 * 12.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 12 cars * 5 rentals/car/month = 60 rentals/month.\n\nThen, 60 rentals/month * $50/rental = $3000/month.\n\nFinally, $3000/month * 12 months/year = $36,000/year.\n\nAlternatively, 12 cars * 5 rentals/car/month * 12 months/year = 12 * 5 * 12 = 720 rentals/year.\n\nThen, 720 rentals * $50 = $36,000.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nMaybe the company is a small operation, or perhaps the $50 is per rental day, and rentals are for multiple days.\n\nBut according to the problem, it's $50 per rental, and each rental is an average of 5 times per month per car.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify the definition of a rental.\n\nIs a rental a single day's rental, or does it cover multiple days?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the duration of each rental, so I'll assume that each rental is a single event, lasting for an undefined period, but the charge is a flat $50 per rental, regardless of duration.\n\nIn that case, my calculation still holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"rental\" refers to a single day's rental.\n\nIf that's the case, and each car is rented out 5 times a month, with each rental being one day, then the total revenue calculation is correct.\n\nBut perhaps rentals are for multiple days, and the $50 is per day.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"charge $50 per rental,\" not per day.\n\nSo, per rental, regardless of duration, it's $50.\n\nTherefore, my calculation is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if \"per rental\" includes the entire rental period, then $50 is the total charge per rental event.\n\nHence, the total revenue is indeed $36,000 per year.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other aspect I might have missed.\n\nFor example, are there any costs involved, like maintenance or staffing, that might affect the net income?\n\nBut the question is about revenue, not net income, so I don't need to consider costs.\n\nRevenue is the gross income before any expenses are deducted.\n\nSo, my focus should remain on the income generated from rentals.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any seasonal variations in rental frequency or demand.\n\nSo, I can assume that the average of 5 rentals per car per month is consistent throughout the year.\n\nTherefore, my calculation of $36,000 annual revenue seems accurate.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try calculating it another way.\n\nSuppose there are 12 cars, each rented 5 times a month.\n\nTotal rentals per month: 12 * 5 = 60.\n\nTotal revenue per month: 60 * $50 = $3000.\n\nAnnual revenue: $3000 * 12 = $36,000.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the number of rentals per year per car: 5 rentals/month * 12 months = 60 rentals/car/year.\n\nTotal rentals for all cars: 12 cars * 60 rentals/car/year = 720 rentals/year.\n\nTotal revenue: 720 * $50 = $36,000.\n\nYet another way: total number of rentals per year is 720, as above.\n\nRevenue per rental is $50.\n\nHence, total revenue is $36,000.\n\nI can't think of any other method that would change this result.\n\nTherefore, I am confident that the annual revenue generated by the company is $36,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36000} \\]"
