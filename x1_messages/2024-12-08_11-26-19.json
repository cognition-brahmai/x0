        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city is adding 50 new buses over five years, and each bus can hold up to 60 passengers. Each bus will operate for 12 hours a day, and the average trip time is 30 minutes. The city expects a 5% yearly increase in daily ridership due to population growth and higher demand for public transport. We need to find out two things: the total number of trips these new buses can make in the first year and the expected daily ridership increase after five years.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the first part: calculating the total number of trips in the first year.\n\n1. **Determine the number of buses in the first year:**\n\nSince the city is adding 50 buses over five years, we need to know how many buses are added each year. If they're adding them evenly each year, then:\n\nNumber of buses per year = Total buses / Number of years = 50 buses / 5 years = 10 buses per year.\n\nSo, in the first year, there are 10 new buses.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of trips per bus per day:**\n\nEach bus operates for 12 hours a day, and each trip takes 30 minutes.\n\nFirst, convert 12 hours to minutes: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.\n\nNow, divide the total operating minutes by the trip time:\n\nNumber of trips per bus per day = Total operating minutes / Trip time = 720 minutes / 30 minutes/trip = 24 trips per bus per day.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of trips for all buses in the first year:**\n\nFirst, find the total number of trips per day for all 10 buses:\n\nTotal trips per day = Number of buses * Trips per bus per day = 10 buses * 24 trips/bus/day = 240 trips/day.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of trips in the first year. Assuming the first year has 365 days:\n\nTotal trips in the first year = Total trips per day * Number of days = 240 trips/day * 365 days = 87,600 trips.\n\nWait a minute, but the city expects a 5% yearly increase in daily ridership. Does this affect the number of trips in the first year?\n\nActually, the 5% increase is for ridership, which is the number of passengers, not the number of trips. The number of trips is determined by the number of buses and their operating hours, assuming they're fully utilized. So, for the first part, the total number of trips in the first year is 87,600.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: the expected daily ridership increase after five years.\n\n1. **Understand the ridership growth:**\n\nThe city expects a 5% increase in daily ridership each year due to population growth and increased demand.\n\n2. **Calculate the daily ridership increase each year:**\n\nLet's denote the initial daily ridership as R0. Each year, the daily ridership increases by 5%.\n\nAfter the first year, the daily ridership would be R1 = R0 * (1 + 5%) = R0 * 1.05.\n\nAfter the second year, R2 = R1 * 1.05 = R0 * (1.05)^2.\n\nSimilarly, after five years, R5 = R0 * (1.05)^5.\n\nSo, the expected daily ridership after five years is R0 multiplied by (1.05)^5.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the \"expected daily ridership increase after five years,\" which might be interpreted as the increase in ridership compared to the initial year.\n\nTherefore, the increase in daily ridership after five years is R5 - R0 = R0 * [(1.05)^5 - 1].\n\nTo get a numerical value, we need to calculate (1.05)^5.\n\nCalculating (1.05)^5:\n\n(1.05)^1 = 1.05\n\n(1.05)^2 = 1.1025\n\n(1.05)^3 = 1.157625\n\n(1.05)^4 = 1.21550625\n\n(1.05)^5 = 1.2762815625\n\nSo, the daily ridership after five years is R0 * 1.2762815625.\n\nThe increase is R0 * (1.2762815625 - 1) = R0 * 0.2762815625, which is approximately 27.63% increase.\n\nTherefore, the expected daily ridership increase after five years is approximately 27.63%.\n\nBut let's double-check that interpretation. The question says \"the expected daily ridership increase after five years.\" It might be asking for the factor by which ridership increases, which is (1.05)^5, or approximately 1.276, meaning a 127.6% of the initial ridership.\n\nHowever, I think it's more appropriate to consider the increase as the difference from the initial ridership, which is approximately 27.63% of R0.\n\nTo make it clear, if the initial daily ridership is R0, after five years, it will be R0 plus 27.63% of R0, which is R0 * 1.2763.\n\nBut perhaps the question wants the compound increase factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the total cumulative ridership over the five years, but that seems less likely.\n\nGiven the phrasing, I think the most appropriate answer is the increase in daily ridership after five years, which is approximately 27.63% of the initial daily ridership.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the addition of buses affects the ridership.\n\nThe city is adding buses, which could potentially increase ridership beyond the 5% annual growth due to improved service and capacity. However, the problem states that the 5% increase is due to population growth and increased demand, separate from the addition of buses.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to consider the 5% annual increase independently of the bus additions.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, we should assume that the ridership increase is solely due to the stated factors.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trips in the first year is 87,600, and the expected daily ridership increase after five years is approximately 27.63% of the initial daily ridership.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total number of trips that can be made by these new buses in the first year is \\boxed{87600}, and the expected daily ridership increase after five years is approximately \\boxed{27.63\\%} of the initial daily ridership."
