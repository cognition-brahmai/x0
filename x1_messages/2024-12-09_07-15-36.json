        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a box with balls of different colors: 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball, and the total outcomes are the total number of balls in the box.\n\nLet me find the total number of balls. There are 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green balls. So, total balls = 4 + 6 + 10 = 20 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, since I want either red or blue. So, favorable outcomes = 4 red + 6 blue = 10 balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of picking either a red or blue ball is P = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 10 / 20 = 0.5.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this. I know that probability can also be thought of in terms of addition of probabilities of independent events. Since picking a red ball and picking a blue ball are two separate events, maybe I can add their individual probabilities.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is number of red balls divided by total balls, which is 4/20 = 0.2.\n\nThe probability of picking a blue ball is number of blue balls divided by total balls, which is 6/20 = 0.3.\n\nSo, if I add these probabilities together, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue) = 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier. So, the probability is 0.5, or 50%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any overlap between red and blue balls. Are there any balls that are both red and blue? No, they're distinct colors, so there's no overlap. That means I can simply add their probabilities without worrying about subtracting any intersection.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the balls are well-mixed and that each ball has an equal chance of being picked. The problem says \"randomly pick one ball from the box without looking,\" which implies that each ball is equally likely to be chosen.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use the formula for the probability of mutually exclusive events. Since red and blue are mutually exclusive (a ball can't be both red and blue), the probability of red or blue is simply the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue) = (4/20) + (6/20) = 10/20 = 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose one red or blue ball is C(10,1), since there are 10 red and blue balls combined, and the total number of ways to choose any ball is C(20,1). So, P = C(10,1)/C(20,1) = 10/20 = 0.5.\n\nWait, but combinations might not be necessary here because we're picking just one ball. Combinations are more useful when picking multiple items, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nLet me also consider the probability of not picking a red or blue ball, which would be picking a green ball. The number of green balls is 10, so P(green) = 10/20 = 0.5.\n\nSince the only possibilities are red, blue, or green, the sum of their probabilities should be 1. So, P(red) + P(blue) + P(green) = 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.5 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking either a red or blue ball is indeed 0.5, or 50%.\n\nJust to make sure, let's imagine actually doing this experiment many times. If I pick a ball at random from the box many times, I should get a red ball about 4 times out of 20, a blue ball about 6 times out of 20, and a green ball about 10 times out of 20. So, red or blue together would be 10 times out of 20, which is half, or 50%.\n\nThis matches what I calculated, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
