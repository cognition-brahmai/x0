        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a staircase with 12 steps, and an ant that can climb either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. We need to find out how many distinct ways the ant can reach the top.\n\nFirst off, this sounds like a classic problem in combinatorics, specifically related to sequences and paths. I recall that problems involving steps and choices might be related to binomial coefficients or recursive sequences, perhaps even the Fibonacci sequence. Let's explore that idea.\n\n**Solution 1: Using the Fibonacci Sequence**\n\nI know that in a Fibonacci sequence, each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.\n\nIn this ant problem, maybe the number of ways to reach each step follows a Fibonacci pattern. Let's think about it step by step.\n\n- To reach step 1, the ant can only take one 1-step. So, there's only 1 way.\n\n- To reach step 2, the ant can either take two 1-steps or one 2-step. So, that's 2 ways.\n\n- For step 3, the ant can:\n\n  - Take a 1-step from step 2 (which has 2 ways to reach).\n\n  - Take a 2-step from step 1 (which has 1 way to reach).\n\n  So, total ways for step 3: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n- For step 4:\n\n  - Take a 1-step from step 3 (3 ways).\n\n  - Take a 2-step from step 2 (2 ways).\n\n  Total: 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nThis pattern seems to be following the Fibonacci sequence, where each step's number of ways is the sum of the previous two steps' ways.\n\nSo, if we generalize this, the number of ways to reach step n, denoted as W(n), is:\n\nW(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2)\n\nWith initial conditions:\n\nW(1) = 1\n\nW(2) = 2\n\nNow, to find W(12), we can just keep applying this formula:\n\nW(3) = W(2) + W(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nW(4) = W(3) + W(2) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nW(5) = W(4) + W(3) = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nW(6) = W(5) + W(4) = 8 + 5 = 13\n\nW(7) = W(6) + W(5) = 13 + 8 = 21\n\nW(8) = W(7) + W(6) = 21 + 13 = 34\n\nW(9) = W(8) + W(7) = 34 + 21 = 55\n\nW(10) = W(9) + W(8) = 55 + 34 = 89\n\nW(11) = W(10) + W(9) = 89 + 55 = 144\n\nW(12) = W(11) + W(10) = 144 + 89 = 233\n\nSo, according to this method, there are 233 distinct ways for the ant to reach the top.\n\n**Solution 2: Using Combinations**\n\nAnother approach could be to think about the different combinations of 1-step and 2-step moves that add up to 12 steps.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let k be the number of 2-step moves.\n\n- Then, the number of 1-step moves would be (12 - 2k).\n\n- The total number of moves is k (for 2-steps) plus (12 - 2k) (for 1-steps), which should equal the total steps climbed.\n\nWait, actually, the total number of moves is k (2-step moves) plus (12 - 2k) (1-step moves), but this needs to make sense in terms of the total steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of 2-step moves and the remaining steps being 1-step moves.\n\nLet me try again.\n\n- Suppose the ant takes k steps of 2 steps each. Then, it takes 2k steps in total from these moves.\n\n- The remaining steps to reach 12 are 12 - 2k, which must be covered by 1-step moves.\n\n- Therefore, the total number of moves is k (2-step moves) plus (12 - 2k) (1-step moves).\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe it's better to think about the number of 2-step moves and then determine the number of ways to arrange them among all moves.\n\nLet\u2019s try to formalize this.\n\nLet k be the number of 2-step moves. Then:\n\n- Each 2-step move covers 2 steps, so k 2-step moves cover 2k steps.\n\n- The remaining steps are 12 - 2k, which must be covered by 1-step moves.\n\n- Therefore, the total number of moves is k (2-step) + (12 - 2k) (1-step).\n\nBut this doesn't directly give me the number of ways. Maybe I need to think about the sequence of moves.\n\nEach sequence is a combination of 1-step and 2-step moves that sum to 12 steps.\n\nThis seems similar to partitioning the number 12 into parts of 1 and 2, where the order matters.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange k 2-step moves and (12 - 2k) 1-step moves in a sequence would be the number of permutations of these moves.\n\nThe total number of such sequences is the number of ways to choose k positions out of the total moves for the 2-step moves, and the rest are 1-step moves.\n\nThe total number of moves in the sequence is k (for 2-steps) plus (12 - 2k) (for 1-steps).\n\nWait, but this seems tricky. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the total number of moves as n, where n is the sum of the number of 1-step moves and the number of 2-step moves.\n\nBut with 2-step moves covering 2 steps each, it's getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should try a different approach.\n\n**Solution 3: Recursive Approach with Memoization**\n\nI recall that recursive approaches can be efficient for problems like this, especially when combined with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nLet's define a function that calculates the number of ways to reach a particular step.\n\nSo, function W(n) returns the number of ways to reach step n.\n\nAs we saw in Solution 1, W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2)\n\nWith base cases:\n\nW(1) = 1\n\nW(2) = 2\n\nWe can implement this recursively, but for n=12, it might not be efficient due to repeated calculations. Therefore, using memoization or an iterative approach would be better.\n\nBut since n=12 is small, recursion should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can use an iterative approach to build up the solution from the bottom up.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nInitialize an array ways[13] = {0}\n\nSet ways[0] = 1  (there's one way to stay at the ground, doing nothing)\n\nways[1] = 1  (one way to reach step 1: take one 1-step)\n\nways[2] = 2  (two ways to reach step 2: two 1-steps or one 2-step)\n\nThen, for each step from 3 to 12:\n\nways[i] = ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]\n\nFinally, ways[12] will give us the number of ways to reach step 12.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\nways[3] = ways[2] + ways[1] = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nways[4] = ways[3] + ways[2] = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nways[5] = ways[4] + ways[3] = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nways[6] = ways[5] + ways[4] = 8 + 5 = 13\n\nways[7] = ways[6] + ways[5] = 13 + 8 = 21\n\nways[8] = ways[7] + ways[6] = 21 + 13 = 34\n\nways[9] = ways[8] + ways[7] = 34 + 21 = 55\n\nways[10] = ways[9] + ways[8] = 55 + 34 = 89\n\nways[11] = ways[10] + ways[9] = 89 + 55 = 144\n\nways[12] = ways[11] + ways[10] = 144 + 89 = 233\n\nAgain, we get 233 ways.\n\n**Solution 4: Using Binomial Coefficients**\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a way to use binomial coefficients here.\n\nIn the second solution, I tried to think about combinations but got stuck.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nSuppose the ant takes k 2-step moves. Then, the number of 1-step moves is (12 - 2k).\n\nThe total number of moves in the sequence is k (2-step) + (12 - 2k) (1-step).\n\nWait, no. If each 2-step move covers 2 steps, then the total number of moves is k (2-step moves) plus (12 - 2k) (1-step moves), as each 2-step move reduces the need for 2 steps.\n\nBut the total number of moves is actually k (for 2-steps) plus (12 - 2k) (for 1-steps), which sums up to k + (12 - 2k) = 12 - k moves in total.\n\nEach sequence of moves is a permutation of these k 2-step moves and (12 - 2k) 1-step moves.\n\nThe number of such sequences is the binomial coefficient C(total moves, k), which is C(12 - k, k).\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the total number of moves is 12 - k, and we are choosing k positions for the 2-step moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the total number of steps covered by 1-step and 2-step moves.\n\nLet\u2019s try to reframe this.\n\nEach path consists of a sequence of 1-step and 2-step moves that sum to 12.\n\nLet k be the number of 2-step moves. Then, the number of 1-step moves is (12 - 2k).\n\nThe total number of moves in the path is m = k + (12 - 2k) = 12 - k.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these moves is C(m, k), which is C(12 - k, k).\n\nBut k can range from 0 to floor(12/2) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is the sum over k from 0 to 6 of C(12 - k, k).\n\nLet\u2019s compute this:\n\nFor k=0:\n\nC(12 - 0, 0) = C(12, 0) = 1\n\nFor k=1:\n\nC(11, 1) = 11\n\nFor k=2:\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nFor k=3:\n\nC(9, 3) = 84\n\nFor k=4:\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nFor k=5:\n\nC(7, 5) = C(7, 2) = 21  (since C(n, k) = C(n, n-k))\n\nFor k=6:\n\nC(6, 6) = 1\n\nNow, sum these up: 1 + 11 + 45 + 84 + 70 + 21 + 1 = 233\n\nAgain, we get 233 ways.\n\n**Solution 5: Matrix Exponentiation**\n\nI've heard of using matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently.\n\nSince this problem seems to follow the Fibonacci sequence, maybe we can apply matrix exponentiation here.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), with F(0)=0 and F(1)=1.\n\nIn our case, W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2), with W(1)=1 and W(2)=2.\n\nThis is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but shifted by one index.\n\nSpecifically, W(n) = F(n+1), where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo, W(1) = F(2) = 1\n\nW(2) = F(3) = 2\n\nW(3) = F(4) = 3\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTherefore, W(12) = F(13)\n\nNow, F(13) is the 13th Fibonacci number, which is 233.\n\nSo, again, we get 233 ways.\n\n**Ranking the Solutions**\n\nNow, let's rank these solutions based on their correctness, clarity, and efficiency.\n\n1. **Solution 1: Using the Fibonacci Sequence**\n\n   - **Correctness:** Correct. The problem aligns well with the Fibonacci sequence, and the calculations are accurate.\n\n   - **Clarity:** Clear and straightforward.
