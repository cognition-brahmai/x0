        "content": "Let's see. So, Emily has twice as many books as Sarah, and together they have 18 books. I need to find out how many books Sarah has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Sarah has S books. Since Emily has twice as many as Sarah, Emily has 2S books.\n\nNow, together they have 18 books, so Sarah's books plus Emily's books equal 18. That means S + 2S = 18.\n\nCombining like terms, S + 2S is 3S, so 3S = 18.\n\nTo find S, I need to divide both sides by 3. So, S = 18 / 3, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, Sarah has 6 books.\n\nWait, let me check that. If Sarah has 6 books, then Emily has twice that, which is 12 books. Together, 6 plus 12 is 18, which matches the total given. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using ratios or something like that.\n\nIf Emily has twice as many books as Sarah, the ratio of Emily's books to Sarah's books is 2:1.\n\nThat means for every 2 books Emily has, Sarah has 1 book. So together, for every 3 books (2 + 1), 2 belong to Emily and 1 to Sarah.\n\nGiven that together they have 18 books, I can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 books there are. 18 divided by 3 is 6.\n\nSo, each \"part\" of the ratio represents 6 books. Since Sarah has 1 part, she has 6 books, and Emily has 2 parts, which is 12 books.\n\nThis matches my previous answer, so I'm confident that Sarah has 6 books.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that Sarah has the smaller number of books, and Emily has twice that amount. So, if I let Sarah's books be S, then Emily's are 2S, and S + 2S = 18.\n\nSolving for S gives me S = 6, as before.\n\nI could also use subtraction. If Emily has twice as many books as Sarah, then the difference between their books is equal to Sarah's number of books.\n\nSo, Emily's books minus Sarah's books equals Sarah's books: 2S - S = S.\n\nAnd since together they have 18 books, I can set up the equation S + 2S = 18, which again gives S = 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fractions. Since Emily has twice as many books as Sarah, Emily has 2/1 times Sarah's books.\n\nTogether, they have 18 books, so Sarah's books plus twice Sarah's books equal 18.\n\nThat's the same as 3 times Sarah's books equal 18, so Sarah's books are 18 divided by 3, which is 6.\n\nRegardless of the method I use, I keep arriving at the same answer: Sarah has 6 books.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that the answer could be different.\n\nSuppose Sarah has 5 books. Then Emily would have twice that, which is 10 books. Together, they would have 5 + 10 = 15 books, which is less than 18.\n\nIf Sarah has 7 books, then Emily has 14 books, and together they have 7 + 14 = 21 books, which is more than 18.\n\nSo, 6 books for Sarah is the only value that makes the total exactly 18.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps there's a mistake in the assumption that Emily has exactly twice as many books as Sarah. But the problem clearly states that, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"together, they have 18 books,\" which means the sum of their books is 18.\n\nI don't see any other variables or unknowns here. It seems straightforward.\n\nJust to double-check, let's plug in S = 6 into the original conditions.\n\nEmily has twice as many books as Sarah: 2 * 6 = 12 books.\n\nTogether, 6 + 12 = 18 books, which matches the given total.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think I've considered all possible ways to approach this problem, and consistently arrived at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, Sarah has 6 books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
