        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field with a perimeter of 60 meters, and the length is twice its width. We need to find the area of the field.\n\nFirst, I recall that the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nwhere L is the length and W is the width.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 60 meters, I can write:\n\n2L + 2W = 60\n\nAlso, it's stated that the length is twice the width, so:\n\nL = 2W\n\nNow, I can substitute the expression for L into the perimeter equation:\n\n2(2W) + 2W = 60\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n4W + 2W = 60\n\n6W = 60\n\nNow, solving for W:\n\nW = 60 / 6\n\nW = 10 meters\n\nNow that I have the width, I can find the length using L = 2W:\n\nL = 2 * 10 = 20 meters\n\nFinally, the area (A) of a rectangle is given by:\n\nA = L * W\n\nSo:\n\nA = 20 * 10 = 200 square meters\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the perimeter equation:\n\n2L + 2W = 60\n\nAnd substituting L = 2W:\n\n2(2W) + 2W = 60\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n4W + 2W = 60\n\n6W = 60\n\nW = 10 meters\n\nThen L = 2 * 10 = 20 meters\n\nArea = 20 * 10 = 200 square meters\n\nSeems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me verify the perimeter with these dimensions:\n\n2L + 2W = 2(20) + 2(10) = 40 + 20 = 60 meters\n\nYes, that matches the given perimeter. So, the area of the field is indeed 200 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
