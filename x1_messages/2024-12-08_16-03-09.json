        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 12 red balls and 18 blue balls. So, total balls in the box are 12 red plus 18 blue, which is 30 balls.\n\nNow, the problem says you randomly pick two balls from the box without replacement. That means once you pick the first ball, you don't put it back before picking the second one. So, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that both balls are red.\n\nOkay, to find this probability, I need to find the chance that the first ball is red and then, given that the first was red, the second ball is also red.\n\nSo, probability of both events happening is the probability of the first event multiplied by the probability of the second event given the first one has occurred.\n\nIn probability terms, that's P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nHere, A is \"first ball is red\", and B is \"second ball is red given the first was red\".\n\nFirst, let's find P(A), which is the probability that the first ball is red.\n\nThere are 12 red balls out of 30 total balls, so P(A) = 12/30.\n\nSimplifying that, 12/30 = 2/5.\n\nOkay, now, given that the first ball was red, there are now 11 red balls left and a total of 29 balls left in the box.\n\nSo, P(B|A) = 11/29.\n\nNow, multiply these two probabilities together to get the overall probability that both balls are red.\n\nSo, P(both red) = (2/5) * (11/29).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, multiply the numerators: 2 * 11 = 22.\n\nThen, multiply the denominators: 5 * 29 = 145.\n\nSo, P(both red) = 22/145.\n\nI can check if this fraction can be simplified. Let's see, 22 and 145.\n\n22 is 2 * 11, and 145 is 5 * 29. No common factors, so it's already in simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a sense of the probability.\n\n22 divided by 145 is approximately 0.1517, which is about 15.17%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 15.17% chance that both balls picked are red.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal balls initially: 12 red + 18 blue = 30 balls.\n\nProbability first ball is red: 12/30 = 2/5.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, remaining balls: 11 red + 18 blue = 29 balls.\n\nProbability second ball is red given the first was red: 11/29.\n\nMultiply them: (2/5) * (11/29) = 22/145.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 30 is C(30,2), which is (30*29)/2 = 435.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 12 is C(12,2), which is (12*11)/2 = 66.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are red is 66 / 435.\n\nSimplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 3: 22 / 145.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is 22/145, or approximately 15.17%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{22}{145}} \\]"
