This is a common practice known as the \"hair of the dog\" technique, where consuming additional alcohol is believed to alleviate hangover symptoms. However, this method only provides temporary relief and can lead to further dehydration and worsening of symptoms in the long run. It's essential to stay hydrated and consider other remedies like eating a balanced meal, getting plenty of rest, and taking over-the-counter medications specifically designed for hangovers."
