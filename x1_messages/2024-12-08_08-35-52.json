        "content": "Mercury is the chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature.\n\nMercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, and other scientific apparatus, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely replaced with other types of instruments. Mercury is also used in fluorescent lamps, mercury-vapor lamps, and some types of batteries.\n\nMercury is mostly obtained by mining cinnabar (mercury sulfide). Mercury is toxic and its compounds are poorly understood, but have been used in medicine, pigments, and other applications.\n\nIn addition to its liquid state at room temperature, mercury has several other unique properties. It is a heavy metal, with a density about 13.5 times that of water. It is also a good conductor of electricity and has high surface tension.\n\nMercury is known for its toxicity, which can cause a range of health problems in humans and other animals. Exposure to mercury can occur through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact, and can lead to damage to the nervous system, kidneys, and other organs.\n\nDespite its toxicity, mercury has been used for centuries in a variety of applications due to its unique properties. However, its use has been decreasing in recent years due to concerns about its environmental and health impacts.\n\nIn summary, mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is a heavy, silvery metal that is liquid at room temperature and has been used in a variety of applications, including thermometers and other scientific instruments. However, its toxicity has led to decreased use and increased regulation in many countries."
