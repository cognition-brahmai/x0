        "content": "This sounds like a riddle! Let's see... \"Three lives have I. Gentle enough to soothe the skin. Light enough to caress the sky. Hard enough to crack rocks.\" Hmm, interesting.\n\nSo, it mentions three distinct aspects or stages, each with different properties. First, it's gentle enough to soothe the skin, which suggests something soft or mild. Then, it's light enough to caress the sky, maybe something airy or gaseous. Finally, it's hard enough to crack rocks, which is very strong and solid.\n\nLet me think about substances that can exist in different states or forms. Water comes to mind because it has three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam). But let's see if that fits the description.\n\nFirst, water is gentle enough to soothe the skin. That makes sense; we use water for bathing and it's gentle on the skin. Second, steam is light enough to caress the sky. Steam rises and can be seen in the air, so that could be interpreted as caressing the sky. Lastly, ice is hard enough to crack rocks. We know that ice expanding can cause rocks to crack, so that fits too.\n\nAnother possibility could be air or gas, but air in its different forms might not fit all the descriptions as neatly as water does. For example, air can be gentle on the skin, and it's certainly light enough to caress the sky, but it's hard to imagine air being hard enough to crack rocks unless it's under extreme pressure, which might not fit the riddle's tone.\n\nSo, I think water in its three states\u2014liquid, gas, and solid\u2014best fits the description provided in the riddle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{water}} \\]"
