        "content": "Let's calculate the total cost step by step. First, we need to find out how much the apples cost and how much the oranges cost separately, and then add those amounts together.\n\nSo, the store sells apples at $1.20 per pound. The customer buys 5 pounds of apples. To find the cost of the apples, we multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds:\n\nApples cost: $1.20/pound \u00d7 5 pounds = $6.00\n\nNext, the store sells oranges at $0.80 per pound. The customer buys 8 pounds of oranges. To find the cost of the oranges, we multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds:\n\nOranges cost: $0.80/pound \u00d7 8 pounds = $6.40\n\nNow, to find the total amount the customer will spend, we add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together:\n\nTotal cost: $6.00 + $6.40 = $12.40\n\nSo, the customer will spend $12.40 in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.40} \\]"
