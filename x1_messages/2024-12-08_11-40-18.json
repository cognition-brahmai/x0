        "content": "So there are 20 students in total in the class. Out of these, 8 play soccer, 7 play basketball, and 3 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, soccer or basketball. Since some students play both sports, I need to be careful not to double-count those students.\n\nI recall that for two sets, the formula to find the total number of elements in at least one of the sets is:\n\nNumber of students playing soccer or basketball = Number playing soccer + Number playing basketball - Number playing both.\n\nSo, that would be 8 (soccer) + 7 (basketball) - 3 (both) = 12 students.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If 8 play soccer and 3 of those also play basketball, then the number of students who play only soccer would be 8 - 3 = 5. Similarly, the number who play only basketball would be 7 - 3 = 4. So, total students playing at least one sport would be 5 (only soccer) + 4 (only basketball) + 3 (both) = 12 students.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nNow, since there are 20 students in total, and 12 play at least one sport, the number of students who don't play either sport would be:\n\n20 (total students) - 12 (play at least one sport) = 8 students.\n\nSo, the answer should be 8 students don't play either sport.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other way to look at this. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion principle states that to find the total number of elements in the union of two sets, you add the sizes of the individual sets and subtract the size of their intersection.\n\nIn this case, the union of students playing soccer and basketball would be:\n\nNumber playing soccer or basketball = Number playing soccer + Number playing basketball - Number playing both.\n\nWhich again is 8 + 7 - 3 = 12.\n\nThen, the number of students not playing any sport would be the total number of students minus those playing at least one sport, which is 20 - 12 = 8.\n\nI think that's correct. Maybe I can try another method to confirm.\n\nLet's consider making a Venn diagram in my mind. There are two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\nThe overlap, which is both sports, has 3 students.\n\nSo, the part of the soccer circle only (soccer but not basketball) would be 8 - 3 = 5 students.\n\nThe part of the basketball circle only (basketball but not soccer) would be 7 - 3 = 4 students.\n\nThen, the total number of students involved in at least one sport is 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total number of students, 20 - 12 = 8 students not playing either sport.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so I'm confident the answer is 8.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of students playing other sports or something, but the question only mentions soccer and basketball, and we're to find those who don't play either of these sports.\n\nSo, no, I think that's all there is to it.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who don't play either sport is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
