First, we need to find out how much the shirts and pants cost before any discount.\n\nSo, the store sells shirts for $25 each and pants for $40 each. The customer is buying 3 shirts and 2 pairs of pants.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost for the shirts:\n\n3 shirts * $25/shirt = $75\n\nNext, calculate the total cost for the pants:\n\n2 pants * $40/pant = $80\n\nNow, add those two amounts to get the total before the discount:\n\n$75 (shirts) + $80 (pants) = $155\n\nThere's a 10% discount on the total purchase. To find out how much the discount is, calculate 10% of $155:\n\n10% of $155 = 0.10 * $155 = $15.50\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final amount the customer has to pay:\n\n$155 - $15.50 = $139.50\n\nSo, the customer will pay $139.50 after the 10% discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{139.50} \\]"
