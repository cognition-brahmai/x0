        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls and 3 green balls, making a total of 8 balls. I need to find the probability that if I draw two balls without replacement, both of them are red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw the first ball, I don't put it back into the box before drawing the second ball. So, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first draw, and the composition of the box changes depending on what I drew first.\n\nNow, to find the probability that both balls are red, I can think of this as two events happening in sequence: the first ball is red, and then the second ball is also red.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the formula for conditional probability. The probability of both events happening is the probability of the first event multiplied by the probability of the second event given that the first event has already occurred.\n\nSo, P(both red) = P(first ball red) * P(second ball red | first ball red)\n\nFirst, let's find P(first ball red). There are 5 red balls out of a total of 8 balls, so:\n\nP(first ball red) = 5/8\n\nNext, P(second ball red | first ball red). This is the probability that the second ball is red, given that the first ball drawn was red. Since we're not replacing the first ball, there are now 4 red balls left out of a total of 7 balls.\n\nSo, P(second ball red | first ball red) = 4/7\n\nNow, multiply these two probabilities together:\n\nP(both red) = (5/8) * (4/7) = (5*4)/(8*7) = 20/56\n\nI can simplify 20/56 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\n56 \u00f7 4 = 14\n\nSo, 20/56 simplifies to 5/14.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem to verify that I'm getting the correct answer?\n\nAnother method is to use combinations. Since the order in which I draw the balls doesn't matter (I just need both to be red), I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = (5*4*3!) / (2*1 * 3*)) = (20) / 2 = 10\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 2 balls out of 8 is:\n\nC(8,2) = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = (8*7*6!) / (2*1 * 6!)) = (56) / 2 = 28\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are red is the number of ways to choose 2 red balls divided by the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls:\n\nP(both red) = C(5,2) / C(8,2) = 10 / 28 = 5/14\n\nOkay, that matches the answer I got earlier using conditional probability.\n\nIs there another way to look at this problem? Maybe by considering the probabilities of drawing the balls one at a time, but considering both orders?\n\nWell, I could consider the probability of drawing a red ball first and then another red ball, or a red ball second if the first one isn't red. But since the problem is only asking for both balls to be red, the order doesn't matter in this case. So, the previous methods are sufficient.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst draw:\n\n- Probability of red: 5/8\n\nSecond draw, given that the first was red:\n\n- Probability of red: 4/7\n\nSo, the probability of both draws being red is (5/8)*(4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the draws in sequence:\n\n- First red and second red: (5/8)*(4/7) = 20/56\n\n- First green and second red: (3/8)*(5/7) = 15/56\n\n- First red and second green: (5/8)*(3/7) = 15/56\n\n- First green and second green: (3/8)*(2/7) = 6/56\n\nNow, the probability that both balls are red is just the first scenario: 20/56, which simplifies to 5/14.\n\nSo, all these different approaches are leading me to the same answer.\n\nIs there any other way to verify this?\n\nPerhaps I can think about the problem using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf I consider the order of drawing the balls, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of permutations of 8 balls taken 2 at a time, which is P(8,2) = 8*7 = 56.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes, where both balls are red, is the number of permutations of 5 red balls taken 2 at a time, which is P(5,2) = 5*4 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 20/56, which again simplifies to 5/14.\n\nOkay, so no matter which method I use, I keep getting 5/14 as the probability that both balls are red.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any dependency or any other condition that I need to account for?\n\nIn this case, since the draws are without replacement, the dependency is already accounted for in the conditional probability and in the combinations.\n\nAlso, since the balls are distinct (assuming they are distinguishable), using combinations or permutations is appropriate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the problem specifies that the draws are random, meaning each ball has an equal chance of being drawn. Since it's not specified otherwise, I can assume that the draws are equally likely.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all the bases here. The probability that both balls drawn are red is indeed 5/14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{14}} \\]"
