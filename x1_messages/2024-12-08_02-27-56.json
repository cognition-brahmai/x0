        "content": "Let's see. So, the train travels from City A to City B in 5 hours and back from City B to City A in 7 hours. It also spends 1 hour at each city before starting its journey again. I need to find out how long it takes for the train to complete 3 round trips.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a round trip is. A round trip means going from City A to City B and then back to City A. So, one round trip includes the travel time from A to B and back to A, plus the time spent at each city.\n\nWait, but the train spends 1 hour at each city before starting its journey again. So, after arriving at City B, it spends 1 hour there before returning to City A, and after arriving back at City A, it spends another hour before starting the next trip.\n\nLet me map this out step by step.\n\n1. Start at City A.\n\n2. Travel to City B: 5 hours.\n\n3. Spend 1 hour at City B.\n\n4. Travel back to City A: 7 hours.\n\n5. Spend 1 hour at City A.\n\nThis completes one round trip.\n\nSo, the total time for one round trip is:\n\nTravel A to B: 5 hours\n\nWait time at B: 1 hour\n\nTravel B to A: 7 hours\n\nWait time at A: 1 hour\n\nTotal for one round trip: 5 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 14 hours.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if the wait times are included correctly.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWhen the train arrives at City B, it spends 1 hour there before starting the return journey. Similarly, when it arrives back at City A, it spends another hour before starting the next trip.\n\nSo, for one complete round trip, from City A back to City A, including the wait times, it's indeed 5 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 14 hours.\n\nNow, to complete 3 round trips, it would be 3 times 14 hours, which is 42 hours.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's any overlap or if the wait times are being double-counted.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nLet's consider the timeline:\n\n- Start at City A: time 0\n\n- Travel to City B: 5 hours \u2192 arrives at City B at time 5\n\n- Wait 1 hour at City B \u2192 leaves City B at time 6\n\n- Travel back to City A: 7 hours \u2192 arrives at City A at time 13\n\n- Wait 1 hour at City A \u2192 leaves City A at time 14\n\nThis completes one round trip at time 14.\n\nNow, for the second round trip:\n\n- Travel to City B: 5 hours \u2192 arrives at City B at time 19\n\n- Wait 1 hour at City B \u2192 leaves City B at time 20\n\n- Travel back to City A: 7 hours \u2192 arrives at City A at time 27\n\n- Wait 1 hour at City A \u2192 leaves City A at time 28\n\nSecond round trip completed at time 28.\n\nSimilarly, for the third round trip:\n\n- Travel to City B: 5 hours \u2192 arrives at City B at time 33\n\n- Wait 1 hour at City B \u2192 leaves City B at time 34\n\n- Travel back to City A: 7 hours \u2192 arrives at City A at time 41\n\n- Wait 1 hour at City A \u2192 leaves City A at time 42\n\nThird round trip completed at time 42.\n\nSo, indeed, each round trip takes 14 hours, and for 3 round trips, it's 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 hours.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any overlap or if the wait times are being incorrectly added.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total travel time and the total wait time separately.\n\nFor 3 round trips:\n\n- Each round trip includes one A to B and one B to A travel.\n\n- So, total travel time: 3 \u00d7 (5 + 7) = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 hours.\n\n- Wait time: after each arrival at City B and City A, except perhaps the last one if it doesn't require waiting.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the train spends 1 hour at each city before starting its journey again.\n\nSo, for each round trip, it's 1 hour at City B and 1 hour at City A.\n\nTherefore, per round trip: 1 + 1 = 2 hours wait time.\n\nFor 3 round trips: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 hours wait time.\n\nAdding to the travel time: 36 hours + 6 hours = 42 hours.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering the timeline step by step for each round trip, as I did before, also leads to a total of 42 hours for 3 round trips.\n\nTherefore, the total time to complete 3 round trips is 42 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
