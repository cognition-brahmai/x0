        "content": "So there's this problem here about a class with 30 students, out of which 18 are girls and 12 are boys. The teacher is going to pick one student at random, and we need to find out the probability that this student is a girl. Hmm, probability can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability is. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a girl, and the total outcomes are the total number of students.\n\nSo, the formula for probability is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nNow, plugging in the numbers from the problem:\n\n- Number of favorable outcomes (picking a girl) = 18\n\n- Total number of possible outcomes (total students) = 30\n\nTherefore, the probability that the selected student is a girl is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{girl}) = \\frac{18}{30} \\]\n\nBut this fraction can be simplified. Both 18 and 30 can be divided by 6.\n\n\\[ \\frac{18 \\div 6}{30 \\div 6} = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\nSo, the simplified probability is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nAlternatively, probabilities can also be expressed as decimals or percentages. To convert \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) to a decimal, I can divide 3 by 5, which equals 0.6. To express this as a percentage, I multiply by 100, so that's 60%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a girl is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), or 0.6, or 60%.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting with 18 girls out of 30 students:\n\n\\[ \\frac{18}{30} \\]\n\nDividing both numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n\\[ \\frac{18 \\div 6 = 3}{30 \\div 6 = 5} = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\nThat's correct. And \\( \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \\), which is 60%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of girls to the total number of students. Here, girls make up 18 out of 30 students, which simplifies to 3 out of 5, hence \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Unless there's some other factor in the problem that I'm missing, but according to the information given, this should be right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
