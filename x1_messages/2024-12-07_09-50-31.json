        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 8 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 4 green balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacing the first one, both balls are the same color. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. Let's add them up: 8 red + 6 blue + 4 green = 18 balls in total.\n\nNow, the probability that both balls are the same color can be found by considering the probabilities of each possible scenario where both balls are red, both are blue, or both are green, and then adding those probabilities together.\n\nSo, the total probability P(same color) = P(both red) + P(both blue) + P(both green).\n\nLet's start by finding P(both red).\n\nTo find P(both red), I need to find the probability of picking a red ball first and then another red ball without replacing the first one.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 8/18.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 7 red balls left and a total of 17 balls left in the box.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 7/17.\n\nTherefore, P(both red) = (8/18) * (7/17).\n\nLet me calculate that: (8/18) simplifies to (4/9), and then (4/9) * (7/17) = (4*7)/(9*17) = 28/153.\n\nOkay, now P(both blue).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball first is 6/18, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nAfter picking one blue ball, there are 5 blue balls left and a total of 17 balls left.\n\nSo, P(both blue) = (6/18) * (5/17) = (1/3) * (5/17) = 5/51.\n\nWait, but I should keep the denominators consistent. Let's see, 5/51 is fine for now.\n\nNext, P(both green).\n\nThe probability of picking a green ball first is 4/18, which simplifies to 2/9.\n\nAfter picking one green ball, there are 3 green balls left and a total of 17 balls left.\n\nSo, P(both green) = (4/18) * (3/17) = (2/9) * (3/17) = (2*3)/(9*17) = 6/153.\n\nNow, to find the total probability P(same color), I need to add P(both red), P(both blue), and P(both green).\n\nSo, P(same color) = 28/153 + 5/51 + 6/153.\n\nWait a minute, the denominators are different here. 153 and 51. I need to find a common denominator to add these fractions.\n\nI know that 51 multiplied by 3 is 153, so I can convert 5/51 to a fraction with denominator 153.\n\n5/51 = (5*3)/(51*3) = 15/153.\n\nNow, all fractions have the same denominator: 28/153 + 15/153 + 6/153 = (28 + 15 + 6)/153 = 49/153.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are the same color is 49/153.\n\nBut, I should check if this fraction can be simplified. Let's see, 49 and 153.\n\n49 is 7*7, and 153 is 9*17. There are no common factors, so 49/153 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 49/153.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{153}} \\]"
