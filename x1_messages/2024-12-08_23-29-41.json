        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students in total, and out of those, 12 are boys. That means the rest are girls, right? So, to find out how many girls there are, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. So, 30 minus 12 equals 18. So, there are 18 girls in the class.\n\nNow, the teacher is going to randomly select one student from the class, and I need to find out the probability that this student is a girl. Probability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is selecting a girl, and there are 18 girls. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of students, which is 30.\n\nSo, the probability should be 18 divided by 30. But I can simplify that fraction. Both 18 and 30 are divisible by 6. So, 18 divided by 6 is 3, and 30 divided by 6 is 5. So, the simplified fraction is 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this probability as a decimal or a percentage. To convert 3/5 to a decimal, I can divide 3 by 5, which equals 0.6. To express it as a percentage, I multiply the decimal by 100, so 0.6 times 100 equals 60%.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a girl is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my calculations. Total students are 30, boys are 12, so girls are indeed 30 minus 12, which is 18. Probability is girls divided by total students, which is 18/30. Simplifying 18/30 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6 gives me 3/5. Converting 3/5 to a decimal is 0.6, and to a percentage is 60%. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportion of girls in the class. Since there are 18 girls out of 30 students, the proportion is 18/30, which again simplifies to 3/5 or 60%. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's the answer: the probability is 3/5, or 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
