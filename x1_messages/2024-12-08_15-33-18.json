        "content": "In music theory, a combination of three or more notes played simultaneously is called a chord. Chords are fundamental elements in music composition and harmony, providing the harmonic structure and emotional depth to musical pieces. They are built by stacking notes in intervals, most commonly thirds, and can be found in various forms such as major, minor, augmented, diminished, and many more complex types. The study of chords and their relationships is known as harmony, which is a crucial aspect of music theory."
