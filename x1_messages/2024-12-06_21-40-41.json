        "content": "The celestial body you're referring to is the Moon. It is Earth's only natural satellite and plays a significant role in causing tides on our planet due to its gravitational pull. The Moon's gravity affects the Earth's oceans, causing them to bulge out in the direction of the Moon and on the opposite side, leading to high tides. This phenomenon occurs because the Moon's gravitational force is stronger on the side of the Earth facing it, and weaker on the opposite side, creating these tidal bulges. The Sun also has an influence on tides, but it is less than that of the Moon. The combined effects of the Moon and the Sun result in varying tidal patterns, including spring tides and neap tides, depending on their relative positions."
