        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a ladder leaning against a wall. It says the ladder makes a 60-degree angle with the ground, and the base of the ladder is 4 feet away from the wall. I need to find out how long the ladder is.\n\nFirst, I think I should visualize this situation. There's a wall, and a ladder is leaning against it, making a 60-degree angle with the ground. The base of the ladder is 4 feet away from the wall. So, it forms a right triangle where the ladder is the hypotenuse, the distance from the wall to the base of the ladder is one leg, and the height up the wall where the ladder touches is the other leg.\n\nIn a right triangle, the trigonometric functions relate the angles to the ratios of the sides. Since I know the angle and the adjacent side, and I need to find the hypotenuse, I can use the cosine function. Cosine of an angle is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, cos(60\u00b0) = adjacent / hypotenuse\n\nHere, the adjacent side is 4 feet, and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder, which I'll call L.\n\nTherefore, cos(60\u00b0) = 4 / L\n\nI know that cos(60\u00b0) is 0.5.\n\nSo, 0.5 = 4 / L\n\nNow, I can solve for L by multiplying both sides by L and then dividing both sides by 0.5.\n\nL = 4 / 0.5\n\nL = 8 feet\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Pythagorean theorem. If I know the base is 4 feet and the angle is 60 degrees, I could find the height and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse.\n\nFirst, I can find the height using the tangent function. Tan(60\u00b0) = opposite / adjacent\n\nTan(60\u00b0) = height / 4\n\nTan(60\u00b0) is \u221a3.\n\nSo, \u221a3 = height / 4\n\nHeight = 4\u221a3 feet\n\nNow, using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nL\u00b2 = base\u00b2 + height\u00b2\n\nL\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + (4\u221a3)\u00b2\n\nL\u00b2 = 16 + 16*3\n\nL\u00b2 = 16 + 48\n\nL\u00b2 = 64\n\nL = \u221a64\n\nL = 8 feet\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the ladder is 8 feet long.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure that all my steps are correct.\n\nFirst, using cosine:\n\nCos(60\u00b0) = adjacent / hypotenuse\n\n0.5 = 4 / L\n\nL = 4 / 0.5 = 8 feet\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen, using tangent:\n\nTan(60\u00b0) = opposite / adjacent\n\n\u221a3 = height / 4\n\nHeight = 4\u221a3 feet\n\nThen, Pythagorean theorem:\n\nL\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + (4\u221a3)\u00b2\n\nL\u00b2 = 16 + 16*3 = 16 + 48 = 64\n\nL = 8 feet\n\nEverything checks out. So, the ladder is indeed 8 feet long.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
