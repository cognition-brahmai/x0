        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. That means, in total, there are 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls in the box. The question is asking for the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacement, both of them will be red.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember how probability works. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. But in this case, since I'm picking two balls without replacement, the probability will change after the first pick because the total number of balls decreases by one, and the number of red balls also decreases if the first one is red.\n\nLet me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst pick:\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first pick is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5 red out of 10 total, so that's 5/10 or 1/2.\n\nSecond pick:\n\nIf the first ball picked was red, then there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 9 balls remaining in the box. So, the probability of picking another red ball is 4/9.\n\nSince these are sequential events without replacement, I need to find the probability of both events happening. To do that, I multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event given that the first event has occurred.\n\nSo, the overall probability should be:\n\n(5/10) * (4/9) = (1/2) * (4/9) = 4/18 = 2/9.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using combinations?\n\nYes, another way to approach this is by using combinations. The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 10 is calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is C(10, 2).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5, 2).\n\nThen, the probability that both balls are red is the number of ways to choose 2 red balls divided by the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!)) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, the probability is 10/45 = 2/9.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to think about this to confirm?\n\nWell, I could think about the probability of not picking any red balls and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of picking at least one red ball, but that's not directly helpful for finding the probability of picking two red balls.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of picking one red and one non-red, but again, that's not directly relevant here.\n\nNo, I think the first two methods are sufficient and correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the step-by-step multiplication of probabilities.\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nGiven that the first ball is red, probability of second ball being red: 4/9.\n\nMultiplying them: (1/2) * (4/9) = 4/18 = 2/9.\n\nSame as using combinations.\n\nAll right, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}} \\]"
