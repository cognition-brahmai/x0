        "content": "So there are 8 red balls and 12 blue balls in a box, making a total of 20 balls. I need to find the probability that both balls picked are red, and it's with replacement, meaning I put the first ball back before picking the second one.\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw. Since there are 8 red balls out of 20 total balls, the probability is 8/20, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, because I'm replacing the ball, the total number of balls remains the same for the second draw. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second draw is also 2/5.\n\nSince these are independent events\u2014meaning the outcome of the first draw doesn't affect the second draw because I'm replacing the ball\u2014I can find the probability of both events happening by multiplying their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being red is (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I'm understanding this correctly. Independent events mean that the probability of one event doesn't change based on the outcome of the other. In this case, since I'm replacing the ball, the probability stays the same for both draws.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. The total number of possible outcomes for two draws with replacement is 20 * 20 = 400, since there are 20 choices for the first draw and 20 for the second.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes, where both balls are red, is 8 * 8 = 64, because there are 8 red balls for the first draw and 8 for the second.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 64/400, which simplifies to 16/100 or 4/25.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. So, I think 4/25 is the correct probability.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if it was without replacement. Although the question specifies with replacement, I can see how it might help to understand the difference.\n\nWithout replacement, after picking the first red ball, there would be 7 red balls left and a total of 19 balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw is still 8/20, but on the second draw, it's 7/19.\n\nThe probability of both being red would be (8/20) * (7/19) = (2/5) * (7/19) = 14/95.\n\nBut again, since the question specifies with replacement, the correct answer is 4/25.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using combinations.\n\nIn the first draw, the number of ways to pick a red ball is C(8,1) = 8.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any ball is C(20,1) = 20.\n\nSo, the probability for the first draw is 8/20 = 2/5.\n\nSince it's with replacement, the second draw has the same probabilities: 8/20 = 2/5.\n\nMultiplying them gives (2/5)*(2/5) = 4/25.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the probability of getting red on the first draw and red on the second draw.\n\nP(both red) = P(red on first) * P(red on second | red on first)\n\nBut since it's with replacement, P(red on second | red on first) is equal to P(red on second), which is 2/5.\n\nTherefore, P(both red) = (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 4/25.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider decimal conversions.\n\n4/25 is 0.16, which is 16%.\n\nAlternatively, 14/95 (without replacement) is approximately 0.147, which is about 14.7%.\n\nBut again, since it's with replacement, 16% or 4/25 is correct.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. So, I'm confident that 4/25 is the right probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}} \\]"
