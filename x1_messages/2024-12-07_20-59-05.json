However, I can share that according to the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew, it is mentioned that \"wise men from the east\" came to visit the baby Jesus, bringing gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The number of wise men is not specified in the Bible, but it is often depicted as three because of the three gifts mentioned. As for them being kings and riding on camels, that is a traditional interpretation, but the Bible does not specifically state their titles or the mode of their travel."
