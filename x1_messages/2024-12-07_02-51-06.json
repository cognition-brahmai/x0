        "content": "So the swimming pool has a volume of 15,000 gallons, and you're filling it at a rate of 20 gallons per minute. To find out how long it will take to fill the pool completely, you can use the formula:\n\nTime = Volume / Rate\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 15,000 gallons / 20 gallons per minute\n\nTime = 750 minutes\n\nBut maybe you want to convert that into hours and minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\nHours = 750 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 12.5 hours\n\nSo, it's 12 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 hours and 30 minutes to fill the pool completely at that rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
