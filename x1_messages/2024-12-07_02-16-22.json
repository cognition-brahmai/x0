        "content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. The city has a population of 500,000 people, and it's growing by 2% each year. I need to find out what the population will be after 3 years. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 2% growth means. Percentage growth is a way to express how much something increases in relation to its original amount. So, a 2% increase means that each year, the population gets 2% larger than it was the previous year.\n\nI think the best way to calculate this is to use the formula for exponential growth, since the population is growing by a percentage each year. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the final population,\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate (expressed as a decimal),\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, the initial population \\( P_0 \\) is 500,000, the growth rate \\( r \\) is 2% or 0.02, and the time \\( t \\) is 3 years.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, I get:\n\n\\[ P = 500,000 \\times (1 + 0.02)^3 \\]\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \\( 1 + 0.02 \\), which is 1.02.\n\nThen, I need to raise 1.02 to the power of 3, which is \\( 1.02^3 \\).\n\nLet me calculate that. 1.02 times 1.02 is 1.0404. Then, 1.0404 times 1.02 is 1.061208.\n\nSo, \\( 1.02^3 = 1.061208 \\).\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial population:\n\n\\[ P = 500,000 \\times 1.061208 = 530,604 \\]\n\nSo, the population after 3 years would be approximately 530,604 people.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 500,000.\n\nFirst year growth: 500,000 \u00d7 0.02 = 10,000. So, new population is 500,000 + 10,000 = 510,000.\n\nSecond year growth: 510,000 \u00d7 0.02 = 10,200. So, new population is 510,000 + 10,200 = 520,200.\n\nThird year growth: 520,200 \u00d7 0.02 = 10,404. So, new population is 520,200 + 10,404 = 530,604.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the final population after 3 years is 530,604.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{530604} \\]"
