It is typically used in dependent clauses. For example, in the sentence \"Espero que t\u00fa vengas\", the verb \"vengas\" is in the subjunctive mood. Which of the following sentences does NOT use the subjunctive mood correctly?\nA. Quiero que t\u00fa seas feliz.\nB. Espero que \u00e9l llega pronto.\nC. Es posible que nosotros vayamos al cine.\nD. Dudo que ella tenga raz\u00f3n."

I know that in Spanish, the subjunctive is used in dependent clauses to express things like doubt, possibility, emotion, or when the action hasn't happened yet.\n\nOption A: \"Quiero que t\u00fa seas feliz.\" This seems correct. After \"quiero que,\" we use the subjunctive, so \"seas\" is right for \"to be happy.\"\n\nOption B: \"Espero que \u00e9l llega pronto.\" Hmm, \"espero que\" usually takes the subjunctive, so it should be \"llegue\" instead of \"llega.\" So this might be the incorrect one.\n\nOption C: \"Es posible que nosotros vayamos al cine.\" Here, \"es posible que\" typically introduces the subjunctive, so \"vayamos\" is correct.\n\nOption D: \"Dudo que ella tenga raz\u00f3n.\" \"Dudo que\" also requires the subjunctive, so \"tenga\" is appropriate.\n\nSo, it looks like option B is using the indicative \"llega\" instead of the subjunctive \"llegue,\" which is incorrect in this context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
