The Colosseum, an ancient amphitheater where gladiatorial contests and public spectacles were held, is one of the most recognizable symbols of Imperial Rome. Vatican City, an independent city-state enclaved within Rome, is the smallest independent state in the world and the spiritual and administrative heart of the Roman Catholic Church. It houses St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Museums, which include the Sistine Chapel, famous for its ceiling painted by Michelangelo."
