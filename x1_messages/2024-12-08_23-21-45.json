        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the probability of drawing exactly three kings when I draw five cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and I'm drawing without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in a standard deck. There are 52 cards, divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K. So, there are four kings in total, one from each suit.\n\nNow, I'm drawing five cards without replacement, which means once I draw a card, it's not going back into the deck. I need to find the probability that exactly three of those five cards are kings.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, it's the number of ways to draw exactly three kings divided by the total number of ways to draw any five cards from the deck.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to draw five cards from 52. That's a combination problem, since the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52 is C(52, 5).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5!(52 - 5)!) = (52!)/(5! * 47!) =\n\nI don't need to calculate the full factorials, since many terms cancel out.\n\nIt's easier to compute it as:\n\nC(52, 5) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) =\n\nLet's calculate numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: 52 \u00d7 51 = 2652\n\n2652 \u00d7 50 = 132600\n\n132600 \u00d7 49 = 650000 (approx, but let's be precise)\n\nActually, 132600 \u00d7 49:\n\n132600 \u00d7 50 = 6630000\n\n subtract 132600 (since it's 49, which is 50 - 1) = 6630000 - 132600 = 6497400\n\nThen, 6497400 \u00d7 48:\n\n6497400 \u00d7 50 = 324870000\n\nSubtract 6497400 \u00d7 2 (since 48 is 50 - 2) = 324870000 - 12994800 = 311875200\n\nSo, numerator is 311,875,200\n\nDenominator is 5! = 120\n\nSo, C(52, 5) = 311,875,200 / 120 = 2,598,960\n\nOkay, so there are 2,598,960 possible ways to draw five cards from 52.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes: drawing exactly three kings.\n\nThere are four kings in the deck, and I need exactly three of them.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose three kings from four is C(4, 3).\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4 - 3)!) = (24) / (6 * 1) = 4\n\nSo, there are four ways to choose three kings from four.\n\nBut, since I'm drawing five cards, and I want exactly three kings, the remaining two cards must not be kings.\n\nThere are 52 - 4 = 48 non-king cards in the deck.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose two non-king cards from 48 is C(48, 2).\n\nC(48, 2) = 48! / (2!(48 - 2)!) = (48 \u00d7 47) / (2 \u00d7 1) = (2256) / 2 = 1,128\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4, 3) \u00d7 C(48, 2) = 4 \u00d7 1,128 = 4,512\n\nNow, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes:\n\nProbability = 4,512 / 2,598,960\n\nLet's simplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n4,512 \u00f7 16 = 282\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 16 = 162,435\n\nSo, 282 / 162,435\n\nCan this be simplified further?\n\nLet's check if 282 and 162,435 have any common factors.\n\n282 is divisible by 3 (2 + 8 + 2 = 12, which is divisible by 3).\n\n162,435 is also divisible by 3 (1 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 21, which is divisible by 3).\n\nSo, divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n282 \u00f7 3 = 94\n\n162,435 \u00f7 3 = 54,145\n\nSo, now we have 94 / 54,145\n\nLet's see if these numbers have any common factors.\n\n94 is 2 \u00d7 47\n\n54,145 divided by 47:\n\nDoes 54,145 \u00f7 47 equal an integer?\n\n47 \u00d7 1,150 = 54,050\n\n54,050 + 47 \u00d7 2 = 54,050 + 94 = 54,144\n\nSo, 47 \u00d7 1,152 = 54,144\n\nBut 54,145 - 54,144 = 1, so not divisible by 47.\n\nTherefore, 94 and 54,145 have no common factors other than 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 94 / 54,145\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal.\n\nLet's calculate 94 divided by 54,145.\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n94 \u00f7 54,145 \u2248 0.001736\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.001736, or 0.1736%.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it as a fraction, 94 / 54,145.\n\nAlternatively, we can double-check our calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me verify the total number of ways to choose five cards from 52.\n\nC(52, 5) = 2,598,960 seems correct.\n\nNumber of ways to choose three kings from four: C(4, 3) = 4\n\nNumber of ways to choose two non-king cards from 48: C(48, 2) = 1,128\n\nFavorable outcomes: 4 \u00d7 1,128 = 4,512\n\nProbability: 4,512 / 2,598,960\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 282 / 162,435\n\nDivide by 3: 94 / 54,145\n\nNo further simplification possible.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 94 / 54,145 or approximately 0.001736.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have made a mistake in simplifying.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nStarting with 4,512 / 2,598,960\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 282 / 162,435\n\nThen divide by 3: 94 / 54,145\n\nNow, check if 94 and 54,145 have any common factors.\n\n94 = 2 \u00d7 47\n\n54,145 divided by 5: 54,145 \u00f7 5 = 10,829\n\n10,829 divided by 7: 1,547\n\n1,547 divided by 7: 221\n\n221 divided by 13: 17\n\nSo, 54,145 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 17\n\nAnd 94 = 2 \u00d7 47\n\nNo common factors, so 94 / 54,145 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave the probability in terms of combinations without simplifying the fraction.\n\nSo, probability = C(4, 3) \u00d7 C(48, 2) / C(52, 5) = (4 \u00d7 1,128) / 2,598,960 = 4,512 / 2,598,960\n\nWhich simplifies to 94 / 54,145.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to express this probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate it using probabilities step by step, considering the draws without replacement.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nThe probability of drawing exactly three kings in five draws without replacement.\n\nThis is a hypergeometric distribution problem, where we're sampling without replacement from a finite population.\n\nThe formula for hypergeometric probability is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (52 cards)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (4 kings)\n\n- n is the number of draws (5 cards)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (3 kings)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = [C(4, 3) \u00d7 C(52 - 4, 5 - 3)] / C(52, 5) = [C(4, 3) \u00d7 C(48, 2)] / C(52, 5)\n\nWhich is what I had earlier: (4 \u00d7 1,128) / 2,598,960 = 4,512 / 2,598,960 = 94 / 54,145\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate it step by step, considering the probabilities at each draw.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe probability of drawing exactly three kings in five draws without replacement.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the different sequences in which we can draw three kings and two non-kings.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange three kings and two non-kings in five draws is the number of combinations of five positions choose three for the kings, which is C(5, 3) = 10.\n\nNow, for each such sequence, the probability is the product of the probabilities at each draw, considering that the draws are without replacement.\n\nSo, for example, one sequence could be King, King, King, Non-King, Non-K King.\n\nThe probability of this sequence would be:\n\n(P first card is King) \u00d7 (P second card is King | first was King) \u00d7 (P third card is King | first two were kings) \u00d7 (P fourth card is non-king | first three were kings) \u00d7 (P fifth card is non-king | first three were kings and fourth was non-king)\n\nLet's calculate these probabilities.\n\nP first card is King: 4/52 = 1/13\n\nP second card is King given first was King: 3/51\n\nP third card is King given first two were kings: 2/50\n\nP fourth card is non-king given first three were kings: 48/49\n\nP fifth card is non-king given first three were kings and fourth was non-king: 47/48\n\nSo, the probability for this specific sequence is:\n\n(4/52) \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (48/49) \u00d7 (47/48)\n\nNow, since there are 10 such sequences (C(5, 3) = 10), the total probability is 10 times this product.\n\nLet me calculate this.\n\nFirst, calculate the product:\n\n(4/52) \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (48/49) \u00d7 (47/48)\n\nSimplify step by step.\n\nFirst, 4/52 = 1/13\n\nThen, 1/13 \u00d7 3/51 = (1 \u00d7 3) / (13 \u00d7 51) = 3 / 663 = 1 / 221\n\nThen, 1/221 \u00d7 2/50 = (1 \u00d7 2) / (221 \u00d7 50) = 2 / 11,050 = 1 / 5,525\n\nThen, 1/5,525 \u00d7 48/49 = 48 / (5,525 \u00d7 49) = 48 / 270,725\n\nThen, 48 / 270,725 \u00d7 47/48 = (48 \u00d7 47) / (270,725 \u00d7 48) = 47 / 270,725\n\nSo, the probability for one sequence is 47 / 270,725\n\nNow, since there are 10 such sequences, the total probability is 10 \u00d7 47 / 270,725 = 470 / 270,725\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, check if 470 and 270,725 have any common factors.\n\n470 = 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 47\n\n270,725 divided by 5: 270,725 \u00f7 5 = 54,145\n\n54,145 divided by 5: 54,145 \u00f7 5 = 10,829\n\n10,829 divided by 7: 1,547\n\n1,547 divided by 7: 221\n\n221 divided by 13: 17\n\nSo, 270,725 = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 17\n\nAnd 470 = 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 47\n\nCommon factor is 5.\n\nSo, divide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n470 \u00f7 5 = 94\n\n270,725 \u00f7 5 = 54,145\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 94 / 54,145\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 94 / 54,145 or approximately 0.001736.\n\nAlternatively, to express it as a decimal, it's roughly 0.001736, which is about 0.1736%.\n\nSo, it's a pretty low probability to draw exactly three kings in a five-card hand.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, perhaps I can use the combination formula again.\n\nNumber of ways to choose three kings from four: C(4, 3) = 4\n\nNumber of ways to choose two non-kings from 48: C(48, 2) = 1,128\n\nTotal number of five-card hands: C(52, 5) = 2,598,960\n\nSo, probability = (4 \u00d7 1,128) / 2,598,960 = 4,512 / 2,598,960 = 94 / 54,145\n\nYes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the probability of drawing three kings and two non-kings in any order, which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 94 / 54,145.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{94}{54145}} \\]"
