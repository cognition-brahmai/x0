        "content": "So if a tree grows 2 rings every year, and we want to know how many rings it will have after 25 years, we can think of this as a simple multiplication problem.\n\nFirst, we know that each year the tree adds 2 rings. So, for each passing year, we can imagine the number of rings increasing by 2.\n\nIf we have 1 year, the tree would have 2 rings.\n\nAfter 2 years, it would have 4 rings.\n\nAfter 3 years, it would have 6 rings.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, to find out how many rings the tree has after 25 years, we can multiply the number of years by the number of rings added per year.\n\nThat is:\n\nNumber of rings = number of years \u00d7 rings per year\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of rings = 25 years \u00d7 2 rings/year\n\nWhen we multiply 25 by 2, we get 50.\n\nTherefore, after 25 years, the tree will have 50 rings.\n\nIt's important to note that in reality, trees typically grow one ring per year, with each ring representing a growing season. However, in this hypothetical scenario, we're assuming that the tree grows 2 rings every year, perhaps due to unique environmental conditions or a different growth pattern. So, based on that assumption, the calculation holds.\n\nAlso, it's worth considering that tree rings can be used to determine the age of a tree, as each ring generally corresponds to one year of growth. But in this case, since the tree is growing 2 rings per year, the number of rings would be twice the age of the tree.\n\nSo, if a tree has 50 rings and it grows 2 rings per year, that would suggest the tree is 25 years old, which aligns with our calculation.\n\nIn summary, after 25 years, the tree will have 50 rings, assuming it grows 2 rings each year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
