        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if you have a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what's the probability of drawing two aces consecutively without putting the first card back? Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how many aces are in a deck. There are 4 aces in a standard deck: Ace of hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing the first ace. There are 4 aces out of 52 cards, so the probability is 4/52. Simplifying that, it's 1/13. Okay, got it.\n\nBut wait, the question is about drawing two aces in a row without replacement. So, after drawing the first ace, I don't put it back into the deck. That means the deck now has 51 cards left, and only 3 aces remaining.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing the second ace is 3/51. Simplifying that, it's 1/17.\n\nNow, to find the probability of both events happening consecutively, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, it's (1/13) * (1/17). Let's see, 1 multiplied by 1 is 1, and 13 multiplied by 17 is... let's calculate that. 13 times 17.\n\nWell, 13 times 10 is 130, and 13 times 7 is 91. So, 130 plus 91 is 221. So, the probability is 1/221.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 cards from 52 is C(52,2), which is (52*51)/2 = 1326.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 aces from the 4 aces is C(4,2), which is (4*3)/2 = 6.\n\nSo, the probability should be 6 / 1326, which simplifies to 1 / 221.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the probability is 1/221.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. The probability of drawing an ace first is 4/52, and then given that the first card was an ace, the probability of drawing another ace is 3/51. Multiplying them gives (4/52)*(3/51) = (1/13)*(1/17) = 1/221.\n\nAll right, consistent results. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{221}} \\]"
