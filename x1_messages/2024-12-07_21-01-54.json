        "content": "Let's see. So, the farmer wants to plant a rectangular garden, and he's using one side of his barn as one of the longer sides of the rectangle. The perimeter of the garden is 100 meters, and the barn side is 30 meters long. I need to find the area of the garden.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. For a rectangle, that's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. But in this case, since one side is the barn, he only needs to fence three sides: two widths and one length.\n\nWait, no. The perimeter is still 100 meters, but since the barn is used as one of the longer sides, that means that side doesn't need fencing. So, if the barn is one length, then the perimeter of the fenced area would be the sum of the two widths and the other length.\n\nLet me denote the length of the garden parallel to the barn as L and the width perpendicular to the barn as W. Given that the barn is used as one length, L = 30 meters.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fenced area is L + 2W = 100 meters.\n\nBut wait, L is 30 meters, so plugging that in:\n\n30 + 2W = 100\n\nNow, I can solve for W:\n\n2W = 100 - 30\n\n2W = 70\n\nW = 35 meters\n\nSo, the width of the garden is 35 meters.\n\nNow, to find the area of the garden, I multiply the length by the width:\n\nArea = L \u00d7 W = 30 meters \u00d7 35 meters = 1050 square meters\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check that. The perimeter is L + 2W = 30 + 2(35) = 30 + 70 = 100 meters, which matches the given perimeter.\n\nSo, the area is indeed 1050 square meters.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem. It says \"one side of his barn as one of the longer sides of the rectangle.\" So, it specifies that the barn side is one of the longer sides, which means that the length is longer than the width.\n\nIn my calculation, L = 30 meters and W = 35 meters. Wait, that would mean the width is longer than the length, which contradicts the statement that the barn side is one of the longer sides.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider that the barn is one of the longer sides, meaning L is longer than W, and L = 30 meters.\n\nBut if L = 30 meters and L is longer than W, then W must be less than 30 meters.\n\nBut in my previous calculation, W = 35 meters, which is greater than L = 30 meters. That doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, maybe I should consider that the barn is used as the length, but L is not necessarily 30 meters. Wait, the problem says the length of the barn is 30 meters, and he's using it as one of the longer sides.\n\nSo, perhaps L = 30 meters, and the perimeter is 100 meters, but I need to make sure that L > W.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet L be the length of the garden (parallel to the barn), and W be the width (perpendicular to the barn).\n\nGiven that the barn is used as one of the longer sides, L >= W, and L = 30 meters.\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is 100 meters, but since the barn is used as one of the sides, the fencing is only for the other three sides: two widths and one length.\n\nSo, the total fencing is L + 2W = 100 meters.\n\nGiven L = 30 meters, plug in:\n\n30 + 2W = 100\n\n2W = 70\n\nW = 35 meters.\n\nBut this would make W = 35 meters, which is greater than L = 30 meters, contradicting the assumption that L is the longer side.\n\nWait, maybe the problem means that the barn is one of the longer sides, but L is actually greater than 30 meters.\n\nWait, no, it says the length of the barn is 30 meters, so L = 30 meters.\n\nUnless the barn is used as one of the longer sides, but L is actually greater than 30 meters.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the barn is used as one of the lengths, but L can be different from 30 meters.\n\nWait, the problem says \"one side of his barn as one of the longer sides of the rectangle.\" And \"the length of the barn is 30 meters.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the barn side is L = 30 meters, and since it's a longer side, L >= W.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, W = 35 meters, which is greater than L = 30 meters, which is not possible.\n\nSo, maybe I need to consider that the barn is used as the length, L = 30 meters, and then find W such that L + 2W = 100 meters.\n\nWait, but that again gives W = 35 meters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the perimeter includes the barn side.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"perimeter of 100 meters,\" which typically means the total fencing around the garden, but since one side is the barn, that side doesn't need fencing.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fenced area is L + 2W = 100 meters, with L = 30 meters.\n\nBut then W = 35 meters, which is greater than L, contradicting the \"longer side\" statement.\n\nUnless the garden is actually longer in width than in length.\n\nWait, but traditionally, length is greater than width, so perhaps in this case, the barn side is not the longer side.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"one of the longer sides.\"\n\nSo, perhaps L = 30 meters is not the length, but the width.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"one side of his barn as one of the longer sides of the rectangle.\"\n\nSo, if the barn is used as one of the longer sides, and L = 30 meters, then L should be greater than or equal to W.\n\nBut in my calculation, W = 35 meters > L = 30 meters.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider that the barn is used as the width.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the barn is used as the width, not the length.\n\nBut that seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter includes the barn side.\n\nWait, no, typically, if the barn is used as one side, that side doesn't need fencing, so the perimeter of the fenced area is L + 2W = 100 meters, with L = 30 meters.\n\nBut then W = 35 meters, which is greater than L, which contradicts the \"longer side\" statement.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the perimeter is still 100 meters, including the barn side, and the barn side is one of the longer sides.\n\nIn that case, the total perimeter would be 2L + 2W = 100 meters, with L = 30 meters.\n\nThen, 2(30) + 2W = 100\n\n60 + 2W = 100\n\n2W = 40\n\nW = 20 meters\n\nSo, in this case, L = 30 meters and W = 20 meters, which satisfies L > W, as required by \"longer sides.\"\n\nThen, the area would be L \u00d7 W = 30 \u00d7 20 = 600 square meters.\n\nBut earlier, when considering the barn side not fenced, I got W = 35 meters, which didn't make sense.\n\nSo, perhaps the perimeter of 100 meters includes the barn side, meaning all four sides add up to 100 meters, and the barn is used as one of the longer sides.\n\nIn that case, 2L + 2W = 100, with L = 30 meters, leading to W = 20 meters, and area = 600 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, if the perimeter of 100 meters is only for the fenced sides, excluding the barn side, then L + 2W = 100, with L = 30 meters, leading to W = 35 meters, which contradicts L > W.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the perimeter includes all four sides, and the barn is used as one of the longer sides, meaning L = 30 meters, and W = 20 meters, giving area = 600 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
