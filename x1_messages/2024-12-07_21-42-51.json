Each step in your plan should produce an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user question, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables the user to perform a search using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It finds a list of potential sources that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nPageLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from an input string consisting of newline-separated links. The input is one or more links, and it outputs plain text containing the link contents.\nURLCollector[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and returns a plain text, newline-separated list of URLs.\nQAEngine[input]: A question-answering language model capable of answering queries based on a provided text passage. The input must be a text-based question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call with input parameter, potentially referencing previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate answer]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what was their major work?"
