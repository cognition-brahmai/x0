        "content": "So I've got this problem about a zoo expansion. They're planning to add new enclosures for elephants, giraffes, lions, and zebras, and the total area for expansion is 100,000 square feet. Each species has a minimum space requirement for their enclosures: elephants need 20,000 sq ft, giraffes need 15,000 sq ft, lions need 10,000 sq ft, and zebras need 5,000 sq ft. The goal is to figure out how many enclosures can be built for each species while maximizing the use of the available space.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like we need to maximize the number of enclosures for each species, given their space requirements, within the total available area of 100,000 sq ft. However, the problem might be a bit ambiguous because it doesn't specify if there are any constraints on the number of enclosures per species or if there are any preferences for which species to prioritize.\n\nOne approach could be to prioritize the species with the smallest enclosure size to maximize the total number of enclosures. Alternatively, there might be other factors to consider, like the zoo's needs or visitor interest, but since those aren't specified, I'll focus on maximizing the number of enclosures based on space efficiency.\n\nLet's list out the space requirements again:\n\n- Elephants: 20,000 sq ft per enclosure\n\n- Giraffes: 15,000 sq ft per enclosure\n\n- Lions: 10,000 sq ft per enclosure\n\n- Zebras: 5,000 sq ft per enclosure\n\nTotal available space: 100,000 sq ft\n\nIf we aim to maximize the total number of enclosures, we should start by building as many smallest enclosures as possible, then use the remaining space for larger enclosures.\n\nFirst, let's see how many zebra enclosures we can build:\n\n100,000 sq ft / 5,000 sq ft per zebra enclosure = 20 enclosures\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and it doesn't consider the other species. Maybe the zoo wants at least one enclosure for each species. Let's assume that's the case.\n\nSo, let's allocate one enclosure for each species:\n\n- 1 elephant enclosure: 20,000 sq ft\n\n- 1 giraffe enclosure: 15,000 sq ft\n\n- 1 lion enclosure: 10,000 sq ft\n\n- 1 zebra enclosure: 5,000 sq ft\n\nTotal space used: 20,000 + 15,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 = 50,000 sq ft\n\nRemaining space: 100,000 - 50,000 = 50,000 sq ft\n\nNow, with the remaining 50,000 sq ft, we can build additional enclosures. Again, to maximize the number of enclosures, we should build as many smallest enclosures as possible.\n\nAdditional zebra enclosures: 50,000 / 5,000 = 10 enclosures\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- Elephants: 1 enclosure\n\n- Giraffes: 1 enclosure\n\n- Lions: 1 enclosure\n\n- Zebras: 1 + 10 = 11 enclosures\n\nTotal enclosures: 1 + 1 + 1 + 11 = 14 enclosures\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to allocate the space to have more enclosures. Let's consider building more enclosures for species with smaller requirements first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zoo has different priorities, like accommodating more space for larger animals. Let's explore that option.\n\nSuppose we allocate more space to elephants and giraffes, which require larger enclosures.\n\nStart by allocating as many elephant enclosures as possible:\n\n100,000 / 20,000 = 5 elephant enclosures\n\nBut then, there would be no space left for other species, which might not be desirable.\n\nAlternatively, allocate as many giraffe enclosures:\n\n100,000 / 15,000 = 6 enclosures with 10,000 sq ft remaining\n\nBut 10,000 sq ft can accommodate one lion enclosure.\n\nSo:\n\n- Giraffes: 6 enclosures (15,000 x 6 = 90,000 sq ft)\n\n- Lions: 1 enclosure (10,000 sq ft)\n\nTotal enclosures: 6 + 1 = 7 enclosures\n\nThis is fewer than the earlier option of 14 enclosures.\n\nAlternatively, allocate as many lion enclosures:\n\n100,000 / 10,000 = 10 lion enclosures\n\nBut again, that might not be diverse.\n\nAlternatively, allocate as many zebra enclosures:\n\n100,000 / 5,000 = 20 zebra enclosures\n\nBut that doesn't provide variety.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the first approach of allocating one enclosure for each species and then filling the remaining space with zebra enclosures is a balanced way to maximize the number of enclosures while having representation from all species.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a way to optimize further.\n\nLet's consider that after allocating one enclosure for each species, totaling 50,000 sq ft, leaving 50,000 sq ft.\n\nInstead of allocating all remaining space to zebra enclosures, perhaps we can allocate space for more lion enclosures or giraffe enclosures.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Additional lion enclosures: 50,000 / 10,000 = 5 lion enclosures\n\nTotal:\n\n- Elephants: 1\n\n- Giraffes: 1\n\n- Lions: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- Zebras: 1\n\nTotal enclosures: 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 9 enclosures\n\nThis is more than the earlier 7 enclosures but less than the 14 enclosures option.\n\nAlternatively, a mix of lion and zebra enclosures:\n\n- 1 additional lion enclosure: 10,000 sq ft\n\n- Remaining space: 50,000 - 10,000 = 40,000 sq ft\n\n- Additional zebra enclosures: 40,000 / 5,000 = 8 zebra enclosures\n\nTotal:\n\n- Elephants: 1\n\n- Giraffes: 1\n\n- Lions: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Zebras: 1 + 8 = 9\n\nTotal enclosures: 1 + 1 + 2 + 9 = 13 enclosures\n\nStill less than the initial 14 enclosures.\n\nAlternatively, allocate two additional lion enclosures:\n\n- 2 additional lion enclosures: 20,000 sq ft\n\n- Remaining space: 50,000 - 20,000 = 30,000 sq ft\n\n- Additional zebra enclosures: 30,000 / 5,000 = 6 zebra enclosures\n\nTotal:\n\n- Elephants: 1\n\n- Giraffes: 1\n\n- Lions: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- Zebras: 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTotal enclosures: 1 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 12 enclosures\n\nStill less than 14.\n\nAlternatively, allocate one additional giraffe enclosure:\n\n- 1 additional giraffe enclosure: 15,000 sq ft\n\n- Remaining space: 50,000 - 15,000 = 35,000 sq ft\n\n- Additional zebra enclosures: 35,000 / 5,000 = 7 zebra enclosures\n\nTotal:\n\n- Elephants: 1\n\n- Giraffes: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Lions: 1\n\n- Zebras: 1 + 7 = 8\n\nTotal enclosures: 1 + 2 + 1 + 8 = 12 enclosures\n\nAgain, less than 14.\n\nIt seems that allocating the remaining space primarily to zebra enclosures yields the highest number of total enclosures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zoo has different constraints, like a maximum number of enclosures per species or specific numbers required for educational purposes, but since those aren't specified, I'll proceed with the initial approach.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of enclosures is achieved by allocating one enclosure for each species and using the remaining space for zebra enclosures, resulting in:\n\n- Elephants: 1 enclosure (20,000 sq ft)\n\n- Giraffes: 1 enclosure (15,000 sq ft)\n\n- Lions: 1 enclosure (10,000 sq ft)\n\n- Zebras: 11 enclosures (5,000 sq ft each, totaling 55,000 sq ft)\n\nTotal enclosures: 14\n\nTotal space used: 20,000 + 15,000 + 10,000 + 55,000 = 100,000 sq ft\n\nThis seems to be the most efficient way to maximize the number of enclosures within the given space.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that having 11 zebra enclosures might not be practical or desirable for the zoo, but without additional constraints, this is the optimal solution for maximizing the total number of enclosures.\n\nAlternatively, if the goal is to maximize the number of enclosures while ensuring a diverse representation, perhaps there's a better balance.\n\nFor example, allocating two enclosures for each species and using the remaining space for zebra enclosures:\n\n- Elephants: 2 enclosures (20,000 x 2 = 40,000 sq ft)\n\n- Giraffes: 2 enclosures (15,000 x 2 = 30,000 sq ft)\n\n- Lions: 2 enclosures (10,000 x 2 = 20,000 sq ft)\n\n- Zebras: remaining space / 5,000 sq ft\n\nTotal space used so far: 40,000 + 30,000 + 20,000 = 90,000 sq ft\n\nRemaining space: 100,000 - 90,000 = 10,000 sq ft\n\nWhich can accommodate 2 additional zebra enclosures (5,000 sq ft each).\n\nTotal:\n\n- Elephants: 2\n\n- Giraffes: 2\n\n- Lions: 2\n\n- Zebras: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nTotal enclosures: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 enclosures\n\nThis is fewer than the earlier 14, but provides more balanced representation.\n\nAlternatively, allocate one enclosure for elephants, giraffes, and lions, and use the remaining space for zebra enclosures, as initially proposed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zoo has specific requirements for the number of enclosures per species, but since those aren't specified, I'll stick with the initial approach.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution for maximizing the total number of enclosures is:\n\n- Elephants: 1\n\n- Giraffes: 1\n\n- Lions: 1\n\n- Zebras: 11\n\nTotal enclosures: 14\n\nTotal space used: 100,000 sq ft\n\nThis approach prioritizes the species with the smallest enclosure size to maximize the number of enclosures within the available space.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
