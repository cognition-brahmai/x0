        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and we're given that its length is 4 meters more than its width. Also, the area of the garden is 60 square meters. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if we can express both the length and the width in terms of a variable, we can set up an equation based on the area and solve for that variable.\n\nLet's denote the width of the garden as \\( w \\) meters. According to the problem, the length is 4 meters more than the width, so the length can be expressed as \\( w + 4 \\) meters.\n\nNow, the area is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = (w + 4) \\times w = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\n(w + 4) \\times w = 60\n\\]\n\nLet's expand this equation:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 4w = 60\n\\]\n\nTo form a standard quadratic equation, we need to set it equal to zero. So, let's subtract 60 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 4w - 60 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 4w - 60 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation for \\( w \\). There are a few methods to solve quadratic equations, such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. I'll try to factor this equation first.\n\nWe need to find two numbers that multiply to -60 and add up to 4. Let's think about the factors of 60:\n\n- 1 and 60\n\n- 2 and 30\n\n- 3 and 20\n\n- 4 and 15\n\n- 5 and 12\n\n- 6 and 10\n\nConsidering we need numbers that multiply to -60, one of them must be negative. We're looking for a pair where the larger number is positive to get a sum of 4.\n\nLet's try 10 and -6:\n\n- 10 \u00d7 -6 = -60\n\n- 10 + (-6) = 4\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, we can factor the quadratic equation as:\n\n\\[\n(w + 10)(w - 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\nw + 10 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad w - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = -10 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad w = 6\n\\]\n\nSince width cannot be negative, we discard \\( w = -10 \\). Therefore, the width is 6 meters.\n\nNow, we can find the length by adding 4 meters to the width:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = w + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 6 meters in width and 10 meters in length.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check our solution to make sure it's correct. If the width is 6 meters and the length is 10 meters, the area should be:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 10 = 60 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nThat matches the given area. Also, the length is indeed 4 meters more than the width, since 10 - 6 = 4 meters. So, our solution seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the quadratic formula to solve for \\( w \\). The quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor our equation \\( w^2 + 4w - 60 = 0 \\), the coefficients are:\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( b = 4 \\)\n\n- \\( c = -60 \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{{4^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-60)}}}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{{16 + 240}}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{256}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{{-4 \\pm 16}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n1. \\( w = \\frac{{-4 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\)\n\n2. \\( w = \\frac{{-4 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{-20}{2} = -10 \\)\n\nAgain, we discard the negative solution, leaving us with \\( w = 6 \\) meters.\n\nSo, regardless of the method we choose, we arrive at the same conclusion. The garden's width is 6 meters, and its length is 10 meters.\n\nIt's also worth noting that we could have approached this problem differently, perhaps by guessing and checking values, but the algebraic method is more systematic and efficient, especially for more complex problems.\n\nIn summary, by setting up an equation based on the given relationships and the formula for the area of a rectangle, we were able to solve for the width and then determine the length. The dimensions of the garden are 6 meters in width and 10 meters in length.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{width } = 6 \\text{ meters}, \\text{ length } = 10 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
