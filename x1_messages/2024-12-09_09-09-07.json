It has the symbol Hg, which comes from the Latin word \"hydrargyrum,\" meaning \"liquid silver.\" Mercury is indeed a heavy, silvery metal that remains liquid at room temperature, and it has been traditionally used in thermometers due to its ability to expand and contract in response to temperature changes. However, it's important to note that mercury is toxic, and its use in thermometers has largely been phased out in favor of safer alternatives like alcohol or digital thermometers."
