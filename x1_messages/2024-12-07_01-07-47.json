        "content": "So there's this problem about a family gathering where 15 people are there, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. The question is, how many handshakes happen in total?\n\nOkay, let's try to understand this. If there are 15 people, and each shakes hands with every other person only once, we need to find out the total number of unique handshakes.\n\nFirst, I think about how many handshakes one person would make. If there are 15 people, one person would shake hands with 14 others, right? Because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nSo, if each of the 15 people shakes hands with 14 others, that would be 15 times 14, which is 210 handshakes. But wait, that counts each handshake twice, because when person A shakes hands with person B, it's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, we've double-counted.\n\nTo get the correct number of unique handshakes, we need to divide that number by 2. So, 210 divided by 2 is 105.\n\nAlternatively, I know that this is a combination problem. We're choosing 2 people out of 15 to shake hands, and the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items, and \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose. In this case, \\(n = 15\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15!}{2!(15 - 2)!} = \\frac{15!}{2! \\times 13!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the 13! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 13!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nSo, again, we get 105 handshakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for the sum of the first \\(n-1\\) natural numbers. Since each person shakes hands with every other person, the first person shakes hands with 14 others, the second with 13 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), and so on, down to the last person who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is:\n\n\\[\n14 + 13 + 12 + \\ldots + 1 + 0\n\\]\n\nThis is the sum of the first 14 natural numbers. The formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, it's the sum from 0 to 14, which is the same as the sum from 1 to 14.\n\nSo, \\(n = 14\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{14 \\times 15}{2} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nAgain, 105 handshakes.\n\nI think this makes sense. All three methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, in a family gathering of 15 people where each shakes hands with every other person exactly once, there are a total of 105 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
