        "content": "So you've got a car traveling at an average speed of 65 miles per hour, and the trip takes 4 hours and 30 minutes. You want to know how far the car travels, right? Well, to figure this out, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, we know the speed is 65 miles per hour, and the time is 4 hours and 30 minutes. But wait, the time is given in hours and minutes, and our speed is in miles per hour. To make this work, we need to have both units compatible. That means we should convert the time entirely into hours.\n\nFirst, let's convert 30 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes would be:\n\n30 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.5 hours\n\nSo, 4 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 4.5 hours.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into our formula:\n\nDistance = 65 miles per hour \u00d7 4.5 hours\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n65 \u00d7 4.5 = 292.5 miles\n\nTherefore, the car travels 292.5 miles.\n\nBut let's double-check that to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. Another way to think about it is to break down the time into hours and minutes separately.\n\nSo, in 4 hours, at 65 miles per hour, the car would travel:\n\n4 hours \u00d7 65 mph = 260 miles\n\nThen, in 30 minutes, which is half an hour, the car would travel:\n\n0.5 hours \u00d7 65 mph = 32.5 miles\n\nNow, add those two distances together:\n\n260 miles + 32.5 miles = 292.5 miles\n\nYep, same answer as before. So, it looks like 292.5 miles is the correct distance the car travels.\n\nAlternatively, if you're more comfortable working with fractions, you can think of 4 hours and 30 minutes as 4 and a half hours, or 9/2 hours.\n\nSo, Distance = 65 mph \u00d7 9/2 hours\n\nTo multiply these, you can do:\n\n65 \u00d7 9 = 585\n\nThen, divide by 2:\n\n585 \u00f7 2 = 292.5 miles\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which method you use, the car travels 292.5 miles.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. For example, maybe the speed isn't constant, and the average speed takes into account some speeding up and slowing down. But in this case, since it's specified as an average speed, and no other information is given, we can assume that the formula Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time is appropriate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. Make sure that the units for speed and time are compatible. In this case, miles per hour and hours match up perfectly, so we don't have to worry about unit conversions.\n\nIf the speed was given in kilometers per hour and time in hours, the distance would be in kilometers. But since it's miles per hour and hours, distance is in miles.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the car travels 292.5 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{292.5 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
