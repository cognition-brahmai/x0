        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you need a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given integer. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n\n- 0! = 1 (by definition)\n\nTo solve this, we can use a simple loop or recursion. I'll show you both methods.\n\n### Method 1: Using a Loop\n\nThis is an iterative approach where we use a for loop to calculate the factorial.\n\n```python\ndef factorial_iterative(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\"\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(factorial_iterative(5))  # Output: 120\nprint(factorial_iterative(0))  # Output: 1\nprint(factorial_iterative(-1)) # Output: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using Recursion\n\nRecursion is a method where the function calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.\n\n```python\ndef factorial_recursive(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\"\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(factorial_recursive(5))  # Output: 120\nprint(factorial_recursive(0))  # Output: 1\nprint(factorial_recursive(-1)) # Output: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Iterative Method:**\n\n  - We initialize a result variable to 1.\n\n  - We then loop from 1 to n, multiplying the result by each number in this range.\n\n  - If n is 0, we return 1 as per the definition of factorial.\n\n  - If n is negative, we return a message indicating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\n- **Recursive Method:**\n\n  - The base case is when n is 0, in which case we return 1.\n\n  - For n > 0, we return n multiplied by the factorial of (n-1).\n\n  - If n is negative, we return a message indicating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\nBoth methods are correct and will give you the same results. The choice between them depends on your preference and the specific requirements of your program. Recursion can be more elegant but may lead to stack overflow errors for large values of n, whereas the iterative method is more efficient in terms of space.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
