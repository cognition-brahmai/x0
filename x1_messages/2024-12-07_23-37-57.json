        "content": "So the problem is about a tree that grows 2 inches every year, and we need to find out how tall it will be after 15 years, starting from an initial height of 10 inches. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The tree grows at a constant rate of 2 inches per year, and we want to know its height after 15 years from now. It starts at 10 inches tall. So, essentially, it's a problem of calculating final height based on initial height and growth over time.\n\nNext, I should identify the key elements here:\n\n- Initial height: 10 inches\n\n- Growth rate: 2 inches per year\n\n- Time period: 15 years\n\nI need to find the final height after 15 years.\n\nNow, how do I approach this? Well, the tree grows 2 inches each year. So, over 15 years, it would have grown 2 inches/year * 15 years. That should give me the total growth over that period.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2 inches/year * 15 years = 30 inches\n\nSo, the tree grows 30 inches over 15 years.\n\nNow, to find the final height, I need to add this growth to the initial height.\n\nInitial height: 10 inches\n\nGrowth: 30 inches\n\nFinal height: 10 inches + 30 inches = 40 inches\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing here?\n\nLet me think again. The tree grows 2 inches every year. So, after the first year, it would be 10 + 2 = 12 inches. After the second year, it would grow another 2 inches, making it 12 + 2 = 14 inches, and so on, for 15 years.\n\nSo, if I were to list it out:\n\nYear 0: 10 inches\n\nYear 1: 10 + 2 = 12 inches\n\nYear 2: 12 + 2 = 14 inches\n\nYear 3: 14 + 2 = 16 inches\n\n...\n\nContinuing this pattern, after 15 years, it would be 10 + 2*15 = 10 + 30 = 40 inches.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as an arithmetic sequence where the initial term is 10 inches, and the common difference is 2 inches per year.\n\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)*d\n\nwhere:\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- n is the term number\n\n- d is the common difference\n\nIn this case, a_1 = 10 inches, d = 2 inches/year, and n = 15 years.\n\nWait, but in the formula, n is the number of terms, which would correspond to the number of years in this context.\n\nSo, after 15 years, n = 15.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\na_15 = 10 + (15 - 1)*2\n\na_15 = 10 + 14*2\n\na_15 = 10 + 28\n\na_15 = 38 inches\n\nHold on, now I'm getting 38 inches, but earlier I calculated 40 inches. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the arithmetic sequence approach again. The formula is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)*d\n\nSo, a_15 = 10 + (15 - 1)*2 = 10 + 14*2 = 10 + 28 = 38 inches.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it's 10 + 2*15 = 40 inches.\n\nHmm, which one is accurate?\n\nLet me think about this differently. If the tree grows 2 inches each year, then over 15 years, it should have grown 2*15 = 30 inches. Adding to the initial 10 inches, the final height should be 10 + 30 = 40 inches.\n\nBut according to the arithmetic sequence formula, it's 10 + (15 - 1)*2 = 38 inches.\n\nWhy the difference?\n\nAh, I see the issue. In the arithmetic sequence formula, n represents the term number, which corresponds to the end of each year. So, after 15 years, it's the 15th term.\n\nBut, in the growth perspective, the tree grows 2 inches each year for 15 years, totaling 30 inches growth.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider whether the growth happens at the end of each year or starting from the beginning.\n\nLet's assume the tree grows 2 inches at the end of each year.\n\nSo, at the end of year 1, it grows 2 inches, making it 12 inches.\n\nAt the end of year 2, it grows another 2 inches, making it 14 inches.\n\n...\n\nAt the end of year 15, it grows another 2 inches.\n\nSo, total growth is 2 inches * 15 years = 30 inches.\n\nInitial height + total growth = 10 + 30 = 40 inches.\n\nBut according to the arithmetic sequence formula, it's 10 + (15 - 1)*2 = 10 + 28 = 38 inches.\n\nThere's a discrepancy of 2 inches.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misapplying the arithmetic sequence formula.\n\nLet me look up the formula to confirm.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is indeed:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)*d\n\nWhere:\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- n is the term number\n\n- d is the common difference\n\nSo, for n = 15, a_15 = 10 + (15 - 1)*2 = 10 + 28 = 38 inches.\n\nBut this contradicts the straightforward approach of initial height plus total growth over 15 years.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the initial height is at year 0, and the first growth occurs at the end of year 1.\n\nSo, at year 0: 10 inches\n\nYear 1: 10 + 2 = 12 inches\n\nYear 2: 12 + 2 = 14 inches\n\n...\n\nYear 15: 10 + 2*15 = 40 inches\n\nBut according to the formula, a_15 = 10 + (15 - 1)*2 = 38 inches.\n\nSo, according to the formula, at the 15th term, it's 38 inches, but according to the straightforward addition, it's 40 inches.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is considering the first term as a_1, and then a_2, up to a_15, with 14 intervals of growth.\n\nWait, the common difference d is added (n - 1) times to get from a_1 to a_n.\n\nSo, from a_1 to a_15, d is added 14 times.\n\nTherefore, a_15 = a_1 + 14*d = 10 + 14*2 = 38 inches.\n\nBut according to the growth approach, it's 10 + 2*15 = 40 inches.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the tree grows 2 inches each year, then over 15 years, it should have grown 30 inches, making the final height 40 inches.\n\nHowever, in the arithmetic sequence, starting from 10 inches, and adding 2 inches each year for 15 years, but the formula only adds d, 14 times, hence 10 + 14*2 = 38 inches.\n\nThis suggests that in the arithmetic sequence, a_1 is the height at year 0, and a_15 is the height at year 14.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the years.\n\nLet me list out the heights year by year:\n\nYear 0: 10 inches\n\nYear 1: 10 + 2 = 12 inches\n\nYear 2: 12 + 2 = 14 inches\n\n...\n\nYear 15: 10 + 2*15 = 40 inches\n\nSo, at year 15, it should be 40 inches.\n\nBut according to the arithmetic sequence formula, a_15 = 10 + (15 - 1)*2 = 38 inches.\n\nThis suggests that the arithmetic sequence formula is giving the height at the end of year 14, not year 15.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider that the nth term corresponds to the end of year (n-1).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should adjust the formula to a_n = a_1 + n*d, considering that the first term is a_1 and then adds d each year.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, a_n = a_1 + n*d\n\nThen, a_15 = 10 + 15*2 = 40 inches\n\nThis matches the straightforward approach.\n\nBut according to standard arithmetic sequence formula, it's a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)*d\n\nSo, a_15 = 10 + 14*2 = 38 inches\n\nBut in reality, after 15 years of growth, it should be 10 + 2*15 = 40 inches.\n\nTherefore, in this context, it seems more appropriate to use a_n = a_1 + n*d, because the growth occurs over the entire 15 years.\n\nHence, the final height after 15 years is 40 inches.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the initial height is a_0 = 10 inches, and then a_1 = 10 + 2, a_2 = 10 + 2*2, ..., a_15 = 10 + 2*15 = 40 inches.\n\nSo, perhaps I was misapplying the arithmetic sequence formula by starting from n=1 instead of n=0.\n\nTherefore, the correct final height is 40 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
