        "content": "So there are 8 apples and 6 oranges in a basket, making a total of 14 fruits. I need to find the probability that both fruits picked are apples, and it's done without replacement because you eat the first fruit before picking the second one.\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of picking an apple on the first draw. Since there are 8 apples out of 14 fruits, the probability is 8/14, which simplifies to 4/7.\n\nNext, after eating the first apple, there are now 7 apples left and still 6 oranges, so a total of 13 fruits remaining in the basket.\n\nThe probability of picking another apple now is 7/13.\n\nSince these are sequential events without replacement, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event to get the overall probability.\n\nSo, the overall probability is (4/7) * (7/13).\n\nWait a minute, the 7 in the numerator and the 7 in the denominator will cancel out, so it simplifies to 4/13.\n\nLet me double-check that. The first pick: 8 apples out of 14 fruits, which is 8/14 = 4/7.\n\nSecond pick: 7 apples out of 13 fruits, which is 7/13.\n\nMultiplying them: (4/7)*(7/13) = (4*7)/(7*13) = 28/91.\n\nWait, 28 divided by 91 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 7, which gives 4/13.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, the probability that both fruits picked are apples is 4/13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{13}} \\]"
