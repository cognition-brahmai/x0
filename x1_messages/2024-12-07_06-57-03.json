        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the maximum and minimum values of a multivariable function f(x, y) but there's a constraint, g(x, y) has to equal some constant c. Hmm, I remember something about this from my calculus class. It's called Lagrange multipliers, right?\n\nSo, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to find the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints. In this case, the constraint is g(x, y) = c.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x, y) and g(x, y) look like. Since they're multivariable functions, they probably look something like f(x, y) = some expression involving x and y, and similarly for g(x, y).\n\nThe Lagrange multiplier method tells us that at the points where f(x, y) has a max or min subject to g(x, y) = c, the gradients of f and g are parallel. That is, \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g, where \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nSo, to find these points, I need to solve the system of equations given by:\n\n1. \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g\n\n2. g(x, y) = c\n\nThat gives me a system of equations to solve for x, y, and \u03bb.\n\nLet me write that out more clearly.\n\nFirst, compute the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (\u2202f/\u2202x, \u2202f/\u2202y)\n\n\u2207g = (\u2202g/\u2202x, \u2202g/\u2202y)\n\nThen, set \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g, which gives me two equations:\n\n\u2202f/\u2202x = \u03bb \u2202g/\u2202x\n\n\u2202f/\u2202y = \u03bb \u2202g/\u2202y\n\nAnd the third equation is the constraint:\n\ng(x, y) = c\n\nSo, I have three equations and three unknowns (x, y, \u03bb). Solving this system should give me the points where f has possible maxima or minima subject to the constraint.\n\nAfter finding these points, I need to evaluate f at each of these points to see which one gives the maximum and which gives the minimum.\n\nWait, but sometimes there might be multiple points, and I need to check the boundary or something. Also, I should consider whether the constraint curve is closed and bounded, because in that case, by the extreme value theorem, f will attain its max and min on that curve.\n\nBut let's assume that the constraint g(x, y) = c defines a closed and bounded curve, so I don't have to worry about boundary points beyond what Lagrange multipliers give me.\n\nLet me try to summarize the steps:\n\n1. Compute \u2207f and \u2207g.\n\n2. Set \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g, which gives two equations.\n\n3. Add the constraint equation g(x, y) = c.\n\n4. Solve the system of three equations for x, y, and \u03bb.\n\n5. Evaluate f at each solution point.\n\n6. Compare these values to find the maximum and minimum.\n\nLet me consider an example to make sure I understand.\n\nSuppose f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, and the constraint is g(x, y) = x + y = 1.\n\nSo, \u2207f = (2x, 2y), \u2207g = (1, 1).\n\nSet \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g:\n\n2x = \u03bb*1 \u21d2 \u03bb = 2x\n\n2y = \u03bb*1 \u21d2 \u03bb = 2y\n\nSo, 2x = 2y \u21d2 x = y.\n\nNow, plug into the constraint: x + y = 1 \u21d2 x + x = 1 \u21d2 2x = 1 \u21d2 x = 1/2, y = 1/2.\n\nSo, the critical point is (1/2, 1/2).\n\nEvaluate f: (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.\n\nIs this a maximum or a minimum?\n\nWell, since f is x^2 + y^2, which is the distance squared from the origin, and the constraint is a straight line x + y = 1, the point (1/2, 1/2) is the closest point on the line to the origin.\n\nSo, this should be a minimum.\n\nIs there a maximum?\n\nIn this case, since the constraint is a straight line, which is unbounded, f can grow arbitrarily large along the line.\n\nBut wait, in the constraint g(x, y) = x + y = 1, if x and y are not bounded, then f can be made arbitrarily large.\n\nFor example, take x = n, y = 1 - n, then f(n, 1 - n) = n^2 + (1 - n)^2 = n^2 + 1 - 2n + n^2 = 2n^2 - 2n + 1.\n\nAs n \u2192 \u221e, f \u2192 \u221e.\n\nSo, in this case, there is no maximum, only a minimum.\n\nBut in the general case, if the constraint is a closed and bounded curve, then there will be both a maximum and a minimum.\n\nFor example, if g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 = 1, which is a circle of radius 1, then f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 = 1 on the entire curve, so max and min are both 1.\n\nWait, that's a trivial case.\n\nLet me take another example.\n\nLet\u2019s say f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, and g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 = 4.\n\nThen, clearly, f(x, y) = 4 for all points on the constraint, so max and min are both 4.\n\nNot very interesting.\n\nLet me try f(x, y) = x y, with g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nCompute \u2207f = (y, x), \u2207g = (2x, 2y).\n\nSet \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g:\n\ny = \u03bb*2x\n\nx = \u03bb*2y\n\nAlso, x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nFrom the first equation: y = 2\u03bbx\n\nFrom the second: x = 2\u03bby\n\nSubstitute y from the first into the second:\n\nx = 2\u03bb*(2\u03bbx) = 4\u03bb^2 x\n\nSo, x - 4\u03bb^2 x = 0 \u21d2 x(1 - 4\u03bb^2) = 0\n\nSo, either x = 0 or 1 - 4\u03bb^2 = 0 \u21d2 \u03bb^2 = 1/4 \u21d2 \u03bb = \u00b11/2\n\nCase 1: x = 0\n\nThen, from y = 2\u03bbx, y = 0.\n\nBut then g(x, y) = 0 \u2260 1, which violates the constraint.\n\nSo, no solution here.\n\nCase 2: \u03bb = 1/2\n\nFrom y = 2*(1/2)x = x\n\nSo, y = x\n\nPlug into constraint: x^2 + x^2 = 1 \u21d2 2x^2 = 1 \u21d2 x^2 = 1/2 \u21d2 x = \u00b1\u221a(1/2)\n\nSo, points are (\u221a(1/2), \u221a(1/2)) and (-\u221a(1/2), -\u221a(1/2))\n\nEvaluate f: (\u221a(1/2))^2 = 1/2 and (-\u221a(1/2))^2 = 1/2\n\nSo, f = 1/2 at both points.\n\nCase 3: \u03bb = -1/2\n\nFrom y = 2*(-1/2)x = -x\n\nSo, y = -x\n\nPlug into constraint: x^2 + (-x)^2 = 1 \u21d2 2x^2 = 1 \u21d2 x^2 = 1/2 \u21d2 x = \u00b1\u221a(1/2)\n\nPoints: (\u221a(1/2), -\u221a(1/2)) and (-\u221a(1/2), \u221a(1/2))\n\nEvaluate f: (\u221a(1/2))*(-\u221a(1/2)) = -1/2 and (-\u221a(1/2))*(\u221a(1/2)) = -1/2\n\nSo, f = -1/2 at both points.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of f is 1/2 and the minimum is -1/2 subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nThat makes sense because f = x y, and on the unit circle, the product x y ranges between -1/2 and 1/2.\n\nAnother way to see this is to use trigonometric substitution: let x = cos \u03b8, y = sin \u03b8, then f = cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 = (1/2) sin 2\u03b8, which has maximum 1/2 and minimum -1/2.\n\nSo, Lagrange multipliers give the correct result.\n\nLet me consider a more complicated example.\n\nSuppose f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3, constrained by g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nCompute \u2207f = (3x^2, 3y^2), \u2207g = (2x, 2y).\n\nSet \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g:\n\n3x^2 = \u03bb*2x\n\n3y^2 = \u03bb*2y\n\nAnd x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nFrom the first equation: 3x^2 - 2\u03bbx = 0 \u21d2 x(3x - 2\u03bb) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 or 3x - 2\u03bb = 0 \u21d2 \u03bb = (3x)/2\n\nFrom the second equation: 3y^2 - 2\u03bby = 0 \u21d2 y(3y - 2\u03bb) = 0\n\nSo, y = 0 or 3y - 2\u03bb = 0 \u21d2 \u03bb = (3y)/2\n\nCase 1: x = 0\n\nThen, from the constraint, y^2 = 1 \u21d2 y = \u00b11\n\nPoints: (0, 1) and (0, -1)\n\nEvaluate f: 0 + 1 = 1 and 0 - 1 = -1\n\nCase 2: y = 0\n\nThen, from the constraint, x^2 = 1 \u21d2 x = \u00b11\n\nPoints: (1, 0) and (-1, 0)\n\nEvaluate f: 1 + 0 = 1 and -1 + 0 = -1\n\nCase 3: \u03bb = (3x)/2 and \u03bb = (3y)/2\n\nSet (3x)/2 = (3y)/2 \u21d2 x = y\n\nThen, from the constraint, x^2 + x^2 = 1 \u21d2 2x^2 = 1 \u21d2 x^2 = 1/2 \u21d2 x = \u00b1\u221a(1/2)\n\nPoints: (\u221a(1/2), \u221a(1/2)) and (-\u221a(1/2), -\u221a(1/2))\n\nEvaluate f: [\u221a(1/2)]^3 + [\u221a(1/2)]^3 = 2*(1/2)^(3/2) = 2*(1/2\u221a2) = 1/\u221a2 \u2248 0.707\n\nAnd (-\u221a(1/2))^3 + (-\u221a(1/2))^3 = -2*(1/2)^(3/2) = -1/\u221a2 \u2248 -0.707\n\nSo, comparing all these values: 1, -1, 1/\u221a2 \u2248 0.707, -1/\u221a2 \u2248 -0.707\n\nTherefore, the maximum of f is 1 and the minimum is -1 subject to x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nWait a minute, but 1 is greater than 1/\u221a2, which is approximately 0.707, so yes, 1 is the maximum, and -1 is the minimum.\n\nIs there any other point I'm missing? Let me check.\n\nFrom the Lagrange equations, I think I've covered all the cases.\n\nSo, in this case, even though there are points where f takes values between -1 and 1, the extreme values are at the points where x or y is zero.\n\nInteresting.\n\nLet me consider one more example to solidify my understanding.\n\nSuppose f(x, y) = x + y, constrained by g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nCompute \u2207f = (1, 1), \u2207g = (2x, 2y).\n\nSet \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g:\n\n1 = \u03bb*2x\n\n1 = \u03bb*2y\n\nAnd x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nFrom the first equation: \u03bb = 1/(2x)\n\nFrom the second: \u03bb = 1/(2y)\n\nSet them equal: 1/(2x) = 1/(2y) \u21d2 x = y\n\nThen, from the constraint: x^2 + x^2 = 1 \u21d2 2x^2 = 1 \u21d2 x^2 = 1/2 \u21d2 x = \u00b1\u221a(1/2)\n\nPoints: (\u221a(1/2), \u221a(1/2)) and (-\u221a(1/2), -\u221a(1/2))\n\nEvaluate f: \u221a(1/2) + \u221a(1/2) = 2\u221a(1/2) = \u221a2 \u2248 1.414\n\nAnd -\u221a(1/2) - \u221a(1/2) = -2\u221a(1/2) = -\u221a2 \u2248 -1.414\n\nSo, the maximum is \u221a2 and the minimum is -\u221a2.\n\nIs there a way to confirm this?\n\nWell, using trigonometric substitution again: let x = cos \u03b8, y = sin \u03b8, then f = cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8.\n\nWe know that cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8 = \u221a2 sin(\u03b8 + \u03c0/4), which has maximum \u221a2 and minimum -\u221a2.\n\nSo, it matches.\n\nAlright, so in summary, to find the max and min of f(x, y) subject to g(x, y) = c, use Lagrange multipliers:\n\n1. Compute \u2207f and \u2207g.\n\n2. Set \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g, which gives two equations.\n\n3. Add the constraint g(x, y) = c as the third equation.\n\n4. Solve the system for x, y, \u03bb.\n\n5. Evaluate f at each solution point.\n\n6. Determine the maximum and minimum values from these evaluations.\n\nIt's important to consider all cases, including when variables are zero, and to verify that the constraint defines a closed and bounded set if expecting both a maximum and a minimum.\n\nAlso, sometimes geometric interpretations or trigonometric substitutions can provide intuition or verification of the results.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Use Lagrange multipliers to solve for maximum and minimum values of } f(x, y) \\text{ subject to } g(x, y) = c.} \\]"
