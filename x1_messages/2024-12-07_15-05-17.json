        "content": "Let's see. So, the train travels at a constant speed of 60 mph, and it takes 2 hours to go from Station A to Station B. First, I need to find out the distance between Station A and Station B.\n\nI know that distance equals speed multiplied by time, so:\n\nDistance from A to B = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, Station C is twice as far away from Station A as Station B, so the distance from A to C is:\n\nDistance from A to C = 2 * 120 miles = 240 miles.\n\nThe train's speed is constant at 60 mph, so to find out how long it takes to travel 240 miles, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime from A to C = 240 miles / 60 mph = 4 hours.\n\nSo, it would take 4 hours for the train to travel from Station A to Station C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If the train travels at 60 mph and Station C is 240 miles away, then yes, time equals distance divided by speed, which is 240 divided by 60, which is indeed 4 hours. That seems straightforward.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using proportions. If Station B is 120 miles away and it takes 2 hours, then Station C is 240 miles away, which is twice the distance. So, it should take twice the time, which is 4 hours. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the speed remaining constant, meaning that the train covers 60 miles every hour. So, to cover 240 miles, it would take 240 divided by 60, which again is 4 hours.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The answer should be 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
