        "content": "Let's see. There's this frog in a 12-foot deep well. It can jump up 3 feet but then slides back down 2 feet each time. I need to figure out how many jumps it takes for the frog to get out of the well.\n\nFirst, I should understand what happens in each jump. So, for each jump, the frog goes up 3 feet but then slides back 2 feet. That means, net gain per jump is 3 - 2 = 1 foot.\n\nNow, the well is 12 feet deep. If the frog gains 1 foot per jump, then it would take 12 jumps to cover 12 feet, right? But wait, I need to think carefully because something doesn't seem quite right.\n\nLet me think about it step by step. Let's say the frog starts at the bottom of the well, at 0 feet.\n\nAfter the first jump, it jumps up 3 feet to 3 feet, but then slides back 2 feet, so it's at 1 foot.\n\nAfter the second jump, it jumps up another 3 feet from 1 foot to 4 feet, then slides back 2 feet to 2 feet.\n\nAfter the third jump, it jumps up 3 feet from 2 feet to 5 feet, slides back 2 feet to 3 feet.\n\nAfter the fourth jump, it jumps up 3 feet from 3 feet to 6 feet, slides back 2 feet to 4 feet.\n\nAfter the fifth jump, it jumps up 3 feet from 4 feet to 7 feet, slides back 2 feet to 5 feet.\n\nAfter the sixth jump, it jumps up 3 feet from 5 feet to 8 feet, slides back 2 feet to 6 feet.\n\nAfter the seventh jump, it jumps up 3 feet from 6 feet to 9 feet, slides back 2 feet to 7 feet.\n\nAfter the eighth jump, it jumps up 3 feet from 7 feet to 10 feet, slides back 2 feet to 8 feet.\n\nAfter the ninth jump, it jumps up 3 feet from 8 feet to 11 feet, slides back 2 feet to 9 feet.\n\nAfter the tenth jump, it jumps up 3 feet from 9 feet to 12 feet, and then, does it slide back?\n\nWait, here's the key. When the frog reaches or exceeds the top of the well, it's out. So, when it jumps to 12 feet, even if it slides back 2 feet, but since it has already reached the top, it's out.\n\nBut in this case, after the tenth jump, it jumps to 12 feet, and since it has reached the top, it doesn't slide back. So, it would actually be out after the tenth jump.\n\nWait, but in the previous jumps, it slides back after jumping. But once it reaches or exceeds the top, it shouldn't slide back because it's already out of the well.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nAfter the ninth jump, it's at 9 feet.\n\nOn the tenth jump, it jumps up 3 feet to 12 feet, and since 12 feet is the top of the well, it's out. It doesn't slide back in this case.\n\nTherefore, it takes 10 jumps for the frog to get out of the well.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way to calculate this without listing each jump.\n\nLet's think about it mathematically.\n\nThe well is 12 feet deep.\n\nEach jump, the frog effectively gains 1 foot (3 feet up minus 2 feet back).\n\nHowever, on the final jump, when it reaches or exceeds the top, it doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, we can think of it as the frog needs to be within 3 feet of the top to make the final jump out.\n\nSo, the frog needs to reach a point where, with a 3-foot jump, it can get out.\n\nSo, 12 feet minus 3 feet is 9 feet.\n\nMeaning, when the frog reaches 9 feet, on the next jump, it can jump up 3 feet to reach 12 feet and get out.\n\nSo, from 0 to 9 feet, with each jump gaining 1 foot, it takes 9 jumps to reach 9 feet.\n\nThen, the tenth jump takes it from 9 feet to 12 feet, and it's out.\n\nTherefore, it takes 10 jumps in total.\n\nYes, this matches what I found earlier by listing each jump.\n\nSo, the answer is 10 jumps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
