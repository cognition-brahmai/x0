        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, 60% of the population are adults, and 40% are children. Out of these adults, 30% have blue eyes. I need to find out what percentage of the entire town's population has blue eyes.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what portion of the town's population are adults with blue eyes. Since 60% are adults and 30% of those adults have blue eyes, I can multiply those two percentages to get the answer.\n\nSo, 30% of 60% is... let me calculate that. 30% of 60 is 0.3 times 60, which is 18. So, 18% of the entire population are adults with blue eyes.\n\nBut wait, is that the final answer? The question asks for the percentage of the entire town's population that has blue eyes. Are there any children with blue eyes mentioned? The problem only specifies that 30% of adults have blue eyes, but it doesn't say anything about children having blue eyes. Does that mean that no children have blue eyes?\n\nWell, since it doesn't specify anything about children having blue eyes, maybe I should assume that only adults have blue eyes in this scenario. If that's the case, then the percentage of the entire population with blue eyes is just the 18% from the adults.\n\nBut that seems a bit too straightforward. Maybe I should consider whether children could have blue eyes as well. The problem doesn't rule it out, but it also doesn't provide any information about children with blue eyes. Perhaps in this town, only adults have blue eyes, but that seems like an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the percentage of adults with blue eyes is separate from children, and I need to consider the total percentage of blue-eyed people as a combination of adults and children with blue eyes. But again, there's no information about children having blue eyes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the percentage of blue-eyed people is only among adults, and since children don't have blue eyes in this scenario, the overall percentage is indeed 18%.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Maybe I need to think differently. Maybe there are children with blue eyes, and I need to find the total percentage of blue-eyed people, considering both adults and children.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's assume the total population is 100 people for simplicity.\n\nSo, 60% are adults: 60 adults.\n\n40% are children: 40 children.\n\nOut of the 60 adults, 30% have blue eyes: 0.3 \u00d7 60 = 18 adults with blue eyes.\n\nNow, the problem doesn't say anything about children having blue eyes, so maybe I should assume that none of the children have blue eyes. In that case, the total number of people with blue eyes is just the 18 adults.\n\nSo, in a town of 100 people, 18 have blue eyes. Therefore, 18% of the population has blue eyes.\n\nBut maybe that's not the whole story. Maybe children can have blue eyes too, and I need to find out the total percentage including both adults and children with blue eyes.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide any information about children having blue eyes, I think it's acceptable to assume that only adults have blue eyes in this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentage of blue-eyed people is the same regardless of being an adult or a child, but the problem specifies that only adults have a certain percentage with blue eyes.\n\nWait, the problem says that out of the adult population, 30% have blue eyes, but it doesn't mention anything about children having blue eyes. So, perhaps children do not have blue eyes in this town.\n\nIn that case, the total percentage of the population with blue eyes would indeed be 18%.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider that children could have blue eyes as well, even if it's not specified.\n\nLet's suppose that some percentage of children have blue eyes, say x%. Then, the total number of people with blue eyes would be (18 + x% of 40).\n\nBut since x is unknown, I can't calculate a specific percentage. Therefore, perhaps the only information we can use is the 18% from adults.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be 18%.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe the 30% of adults having blue eyes contributes to the total percentage of blue-eyed people in the town.\n\nSo, if 60% are adults and 30% of them have blue eyes, that's 18% of the total population.\n\nIf children don't have blue eyes, then indeed, 18% is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if children do have blue eyes, but it's not specified, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that only adults have blue eyes.\n\nIn that case, the answer is 18%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's a straightforward calculation of 30% of 60%, which is 18%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the entire town's population that has blue eyes is 18%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18\\%} \\]"
