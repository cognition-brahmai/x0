This punishment was imposed after the Titanomachy, the war between the Olympian gods and the Titans, in which Atlas and his fellow Titans were defeated. According to the myth, Atlas was assigned the task of supporting the celestial heavens for eternity as a punishment for leading the charge against the Olympians. This story is often referenced in literature and popular culture, and the term \"Atlas\" is also used to describe someone who carries a heavy burden."
