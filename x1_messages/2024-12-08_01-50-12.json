        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to make a simple calculator in Ruby that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. I need to make sure it's a command-line program, so it should take inputs from the user and print the result.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how command-line arguments work in Ruby. I know that in Ruby, command-line arguments can be accessed using the ARGV array. So, if a user runs the program like this:\n\nruby calculator.rb add 5 3\n\nThen ARGV will contain [\"add\", \"5\", \"3\"].\n\nSo, my program needs to check the first argument to determine the operation and then perform that operation on the next two arguments.\n\nI should also make sure that the user provides exactly three arguments: the operation and two numbers. If not, I should display an error message.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the program.\n\n1. Check if exactly three arguments are provided.\n\n2. If not, print an error message.\n\n3. If yes, assign the operation and the two numbers.\n\n4. Convert the two numbers from strings to integers or floats.\n\n5. Based on the operation, perform the corresponding calculation.\n\n6. Print the result.\n\nI need to handle four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet me write some pseudocode first.\n\nif ARGV.length != 3\n\n  puts \"Error: Provide exactly three arguments: operation and two numbers.\"\n\nelse\n\n  operation = ARGV[0]\n\n  num1 = ARGV[1].to_f\n\n  num2 = ARGV[2].to_f\n\n  \n\n  case operation\n\n  when \"add\"\n\n    result = num1 + num2\n\n  when \"subtract\"\n\n    result = num1 - num2\n\n  when \"multiply\"\n\n    result = num1 * num2\n\n  when \"divide\"\n\n    if num2 != 0\n\n      result = num1 / num2\n\n    else\n\n      puts \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\n\n    end\n\n  else\n\n    puts \"Error: Invalid operation. Supported operations are add, subtract, multiply, divide.\"\n\n  end\n\n  \n\n  puts \"Result: #{result}\"\n\nend\n\nHmm, I think that makes sense. I'm using to_f to convert the arguments to floats, so the calculator can handle decimal numbers as well.\n\nI should also consider possible errors, like if the user provides non-numeric arguments for numbers. I need to add some error handling for that.\n\nMaybe I can use begin-rescue to handle exceptions when converting to floats.\n\nLet me adjust the pseudocode.\n\nbegin\n\n  if ARGV.length != 3\n\n    puts \"Error: Provide exactly three arguments: operation and two numbers.\"\n\n  else\n\n    operation = ARGV[0]\n\n    num1 = ARGV[1].to_f\n\n    num2 = ARGV[2].to_f\n\n      \n\n    case operation\n\n    when \"add\"\n\n      result = num1 + num2\n\n    when \"subtract\"\n\n      result = num1 - num2\n\n    when \"multiply\"\n\n      result = num1 * num2\n\n    when \"divide\"\n\n      if num2 != 0\n\n        result = num1 / num2\n\n      else\n\n        puts \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\n\n      end\n\n    else\n\n      puts \"Error: Invalid operation. Supported operations are add, subtract, multiply, divide.\"\n\n    end\n\n      \n\n    puts \"Result: #{result}\"\n\n  end\n\nrescue ArgumentError\n\n  puts \"Error: Invalid numbers. Please enter numeric values for numbers.\"\n\nend\n\nThis way, if ARGV[1] or ARGV[2] cannot be converted to floats, it will raise an ArgumentError, which I can catch and display an error message.\n\nI think this should cover most of the cases.\n\nLet me think about how to test this.\n\nTest cases:\n\n1. ruby calculator.rb add 5 3 -> should return 8\n\n2. ruby calculator.rb subtract 5 3 -> should return 2\n\n3. ruby calculator.rb multiply 5 3 -> should return 15\n\n4. ruby calculator.rb divide 5 3 -> should return 1.666...\n\n5. ruby calculator.rb divide 5 0 -> should return an error for division by zero\n\n6. ruby calculator.rb add 5 abc -> should return an error for invalid numbers\n\n7. ruby calculator.rb add 5 -> should return an error for insufficient arguments\n\n8. ruby calculator.rb xyz 5 3 -> should return an error for invalid operation\n\nYes, these test cases should cover the main scenarios.\n\nI should also consider if the user provides more than three arguments. For example:\n\nruby calculator.rb add 5 3 2\n\nIn this case, ARGV will have more than three elements, so the initial check will catch it and display the error message.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the user might use different cases for the operation, like \"Add\" or \"ADD\". To make it case-insensitive, I can downcase the operation before checking.\n\nSo, operation = ARGV[0].downcase\n\nThat way, \"add\", \"Add\", \"ADD\", etc., will all be treated the same.\n\nAlso, for division, I should consider floating-point results, which is why I'm using to_f instead of to_i.\n\nLet me also think about formatting the output for division, maybe to a certain number of decimal places.\n\nI can use sprintf to format the output.\n\nFor example:\n\nputs \"Result: %.2f\" % result\n\nThis will display the result with two decimal places.\n\nBut perhaps I should just let Ruby handle the formatting and use to_f.\n\nAlternatively, I can use number_with_precision from the number_helper, but that might be overkill for a simple calculator.\n\nActually, for simplicity, I'll just use to_f and let Ruby handle the formatting.\n\nBut to make it look nice, maybe I can check if the result is an integer, and if so, don't display the decimal part.\n\nI can do that by checking if result == result.to_i, and if so, convert it to integer before displaying.\n\nHere's how I can adjust the code.\n\nif result == result.to_i\n\n  puts \"Result: #{result.to_i}\"\n\nelse\n\n  puts \"Result: #{result}\"\n\nend\n\nThis should give a cleaner output for integer results.\n\nAlso, I should consider negative numbers and ensuring that the conversions handle them correctly.\n\nSince to_f can handle negative numbers, I think it's fine.\n\nLet me also think about exponentiation or other operations, but since the task is to support only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, I'll stick to those.\n\nI should make sure that the user cannot input any other operation without getting an error.\n\nNow, let me think about writing the actual code.\n\nI need to create a file, say calculator.rb, and write the Ruby code inside.\n\nI should also add a shebang line at the beginning to specify the Ruby interpreter.\n\nSo, the first line should be #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nAlso, I should make the script executable by setting the appropriate permissions.\n\nBut since I'm writing the code, I'll focus on the code first.\n\nLet me summarize the steps again:\n\n1. Check if exactly three arguments are provided; else, display an error.\n\n2. Convert the second and third arguments to floats.\n\n3. Handle possible ArgumentError during conversion.\n\n4. Downcase the operation for case-insensitivity.\n\n5. Use a case statement to perform the operation.\n\n6. Handle division by zero.\n\n7. Display the result with appropriate formatting.\n\nI think that covers everything.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Ruby that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can follow the steps below. This calculator will take user inputs from the command line and display the results accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check Arguments**: Ensure exactly three arguments are provided (operation and two numbers).\n2. **Convert Inputs**: Convert the two numbers from strings to floats.\n3. **Perform Operations**: Based on the operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide), perform the corresponding calculation.\n4. **Handle Errors**: Manage errors such as incorrect number of arguments, invalid numbers, and division by zero.\n5. **Display Result**: Output the result in a user-friendly format.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```ruby\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nbegin\n  if ARGV.length != 3\n    puts \"Error: Provide exactly three arguments: operation and two numbers.\"\n  else\n    operation = ARGV[0].downcase\n    num1 = ARGV[1].to_f\n    num2 = ARGV[2].to_f\n\n    case operation\n    when \"add\"\n      result = num1 + num2\n    when \"subtract\"\n      result = num1 - num2\n    when \"multiply\"\n      result = num1 * num2\n    when \"divide\"\n      if num2 != 0\n        result = num1 / num2\n      else\n        puts \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\n        exit\n      end\n    else\n      puts \"Error: Invalid operation. Supported operations are add, subtract, multiply, divide.\"\n      exit\n    end\n\n    if result == result.to_i\n      puts \"Result: #{result.to_i}\"\n    else\n      puts \"Result: #{result}\"\n    end\n  end\nrescue ArgumentError\n  puts \"Error: Invalid numbers. Please enter numeric values for numbers.\"\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Argument Check**: The script first checks if exactly three arguments are provided. If not, it displays an error message.\n2. **Operation and Numbers**: It extracts the operation and converts the next two arguments to floats.\n3. **Case Statement**: Depending on the operation, it performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n4. **Division by Zero**: If division by zero is attempted, it displays an error message.\n5. **Invalid Operation**: If an unsupported operation is provided, it informs the user of the supported operations.\n6. **Result Formatting**: It checks if the result is an integer and displays it without decimal places if possible.\n7. **Error Handling**: It uses a `begin-rescue` block to catch and handle errors during number conversion.\n\nThis simple calculator handles basic arithmetic operations and ensures that user inputs are managed properly, providing clear feedback in case of errors."
