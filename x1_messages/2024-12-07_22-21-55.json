        "content": "So I've got this problem here about an airline trying to figure out if a new flight route is profitable. Let's see what we've got.\n\nFirst, the plane has a capacity of 250 passengers and does one round-trip flight per day. The fixed costs for operating this route are $50,000 per month, and variable costs are $20,000 per round-trip flight. We need to calculate the monthly revenue needed to break even and then find the minimum ticket price assuming a 90% average occupancy rate.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what break-even means. Break-even is when the total revenue equals the total costs, so the airline isn't making a profit or a loss. So, total revenue needed to break even is equal to total fixed costs plus total variable costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total variable costs per month. Since there's one round-trip flight per day, and variable costs are $20,000 per round-trip, we need to find out how many days in a month the flights operate. Assuming a month has about 30 days, the total variable costs would be:\n\nTotal variable costs = variable cost per flight \u00d7 number of flights per month\n\nNumber of flights per month = 1 flight/day \u00d7 30 days/month = 30 flights/month\n\nTotal variable costs = $20,000 \u00d7 30 = $600,000\n\nNow, add the fixed costs:\n\nTotal costs = fixed costs + total variable costs = $50,000 + $600,000 = $650,000\n\nSo, the airline needs to make $650,000 in revenue per month to break even.\n\nNext, we need to find the minimum ticket price assuming a 90% average occupancy rate.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many passengers are on each flight on average.\n\nOccupancy rate = 90% of 250 passengers = 0.9 \u00d7 250 = 225 passengers per flight\n\nNow, total passengers per month = passengers per flight \u00d7 number of flights per month = 225 \u00d7 30 = 6,750 passengers/month\n\nNow, to find the minimum ticket price, we need to divide the total revenue needed by the total number of passengers.\n\nMinimum ticket price = total revenue needed / total passengers per month = $650,000 / 6,750 \u2248 $96.2973\n\nSo, the minimum ticket price should be approximately $96.30 per ticket to break even.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nTotal revenue needed is $650,000\n\nTotal passengers per month is 6,750\n\nSo, $650,000 \u00f7 6,750 = approximately $96.2973, which rounds to $96.30\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut, let's consider if there's anything else we should account for. Are there any other costs that might be involved?\n\nThe problem mentions fixed costs of $50,000 per month and variable costs of $20,000 per round-trip flight. Assuming these are the only costs, this should be fine.\n\nAlso, assuming that the month has 30 days is a common practice, but in reality, months have between 28 and 31 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, 30 days is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the occupancy rate is given as 90%, so we've used that to calculate the average number of passengers per flight.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the monthly revenue needed to break even is $650,000, and the minimum ticket price required, assuming a 90% occupancy rate, is approximately $96.30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96.30} \\]"
