Sandcastles stand sentinel by the shore, as swimmers splash and surf in the sparkling surf. Sunflowers sway softly in the summer breeze, their stems stretching towards the scorching sun. Seasonal snacks, like sweet strawberries and succulent watermelons, satisfy summer thirsts. Sunset skies sprawl with shades of scarlet, salmon, and sapphire, signaling the serene end to another sunny day.\""
