        "content": "To design a SQL query that retrieves the top 10 most frequently occurring words in the \"comments\" table, along with their frequency count, we need to perform several steps. These include splitting the comment text into individual words, counting the occurrences of each word, and then selecting the top 10 words based on their frequency.\n\nHowever, standard SQL does not have built-in functions to split strings into words, so the approach can vary depending on the specific SQL database being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server). Below, I'll provide a general approach and then a specific example for PostgreSQL, as it offers some useful text processing functions.\n\n### General Approach\n\n1. **Split the comment text into words:** This typically involves breaking the comment text on spaces and punctuation.\n2. **Normalize the words:** Convert all words to lowercase to ensure that variations of the same word (e.g., \"Word\" and \"word\") are counted together.\n3. **Count the frequency of each word:** Use a GROUP BY clause to count occurrences of each word.\n4. **Order and limit the results:** Order the words by their frequency in descending order and limit the output to the top 10 words.\n\n### PostgreSQL Specific Solution\n\nPostgreSQL provides the `regexp_split_to_table` function, which can be used to split text based on regular expressions. We can use this to split the comment text into words.\n\nHere's a step-by-step query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    word, \n    COUNT(*) AS frequency\nFROM (\n    SELECT \n        LOWER(\n            REGEXP_REPLACE(\n                comment_text, \n                '[^\\w\\s]', \n                '', \n                'g'\n            )\n        ) AS cleaned_comment\n    FROM \n        comments\n) AS cleaned_comments\nCROSS JOIN LATERAL \n    regexp_split_to_table(cleaned_comment, '\\s+') AS words(word)\nGROUP BY \n    word\nORDER BY \n    frequency DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Subquery to Clean Comments:**\n   - `REGEXP_REPLACE(comment_text, '[^\\w\\s]', '', 'g')`: This removes all non-word characters (excluding spaces) from the comment text.\n   - `LOWER(...)`: Converts the cleaned comment to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive counting.\n\n2. **Splitting into Words:**\n   - `regexp_split_to_table(cleaned_comment, '\\s+')`: Splits the cleaned comment into words based on spaces.\n\n3. **Counting Word Frequencies:**\n   - `GROUP BY word`: Groups the words to count their occurrences.\n   - `COUNT(*) AS frequency`: Counts the number of times each word appears.\n\n4. **Ordering and Limiting:**\n   - `ORDER BY frequency DESC`: Orders the words by their frequency in descending order.\n   - `LIMIT 10`: Limits the output to the top 10 words.\n\nThis query should give you the top 10 most frequently occurring words in the \"comments\" table along with their frequency counts in a PostgreSQL database. If you're using a different SQL database, the approach might need to be adjusted based on the available string functions and capabilities of that database."
