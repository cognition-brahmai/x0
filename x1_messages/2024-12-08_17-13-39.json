        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where there are 7 times as many people as dogs, and 5 times as many cats as dogs. Altogether, there are 210 animals. We need to find out how many people live in the town.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The town has people, dogs, and cats, and we're told there are 210 animals in total. Now, animals would be dogs and cats, right? Because people are, well, people, not animals. So, maybe I need to consider only dogs and cats as animals.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"210 animals,\" and it mentions that there are people, dogs, and cats. But people are not animals in the biological sense, but maybe in this context, they are considering people as animals too. Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"There are 7 times as many people as dogs. There are 5 times as many cats as dogs. If there are 210 animals, how many people live in the town?\"\n\nOkay, so it says \"210 animals,\" and animals probably refer to dogs and cats only, not people. So, perhaps the total number of dogs and cats is 210, and people are separate from that.\n\nBut then, why mention people in relation to dogs if animals are only dogs and cats? This is a bit tricky.\n\nLet me try to define variables to represent each group:\n\nLet D = number of dogs\n\nThen, people = 7D (since there are 7 times as many people as dogs)\n\nAnd cats = 5D (since there are 5 times as many cats as dogs)\n\nNow, if animals are only dogs and cats, then animals = D + cats = D + 5D = 6D\n\nBut the problem says there are 210 animals, so 6D = 210\n\nThen, D = 210 / 6 = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 dogs.\n\nThen, people = 7D = 7 * 35 = 245\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the number of people, which would be 245.\n\nBut let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal animals are dogs and cats: D + 5D = 6D = 210, which gives D = 35.\n\nPeople = 7D = 245.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering people as part of the animals, which would be unusual, but let's explore that just in case.\n\nIf people are considered animals, then total animals = people + dogs + cats = 7D + D + 5D = 13D\n\nThen, 13D = 210, so D = 210 / 13 \u2248 16.15, which doesn't make sense because the number of dogs should be a whole number.\n\nSo, that can't be right. Therefore, it's more logical to consider animals as only dogs and cats.\n\nThus, animals = D + 5D = 6D = 210 \u2192 D = 35 \u2192 people = 7D = 245\n\nSo, the answer should be 245 people.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the problem means that the total number of people and animals together is 210.\n\nIn that case, people + dogs + cats = 7D + D + 5D = 13D = 210, which, as before, gives D \u2248 16.15, which isn't a whole number.\n\nThat doesn't make sense, so probably not the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"210 animals\" refers only to cats and dogs, and people are separate.\n\nIn that case, animals = cats + dogs = 5D + D = 6D = 210 \u2192 D = 35 \u2192 people = 7D = 245\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"animals\" is meant to include people, cats, and dogs, but that seems unusual.\n\nIn that case, animals = people + cats + dogs = 7D + 5D + D = 13D = 210 \u2192 D \u2248 16.15, which doesn't work.\n\nSo, the only logical interpretation is that animals are only dogs and cats, totaling 210.\n\nTherefore, D + 5D = 6D = 210 \u2192 D = 35 \u2192 people = 7D = 245\n\nThus, there are 245 people in the town.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{245} \\]"
