        "content": "At exactly 3:30 PM, the minute hand will be pointing directly at the 6 on the clock, which represents 30 minutes. Each minute on the clock corresponds to 6 degrees because a full circle is 360 degrees and there are 60 minutes in an hour (360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees per minute). So, at 30 minutes, the minute hand is at:\n\n30 minutes * 6 degrees/minute = 180 degrees\n\nNow, for the hour hand, it's a bit more complicated because it moves as time passes. At 3:00 PM, the hour hand is exactly on the 3, which is 90 degrees from the 12 (since each hour represents 30 degrees: 360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour). But by 3:30 PM, the hour hand has moved halfway between the 3 and the 4 because 30 minutes is half an hour.\n\nSo, the hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, and in 30 minutes, it moves:\n\n30 degrees/hour * 0.5 hour = 15 degrees\n\nTherefore, at 3:30 PM, the hour hand is at:\n\n90 degrees (for 3:00 PM) + 15 degrees = 105 degrees\n\nNow, to find the angle between the hour and minute hands, we subtract the smaller angle from the larger one:\n\n180 degrees (minute hand) - 105 degrees (hour hand) = 75 degrees\n\nHowever, on a clock, angles can be measured in two directions: clockwise and counterclockwise. So, the other possible angle between the hands is:\n\n360 degrees - 75 degrees = 285 degrees\n\nBut typically, we take the smaller angle, which is 75 degrees.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I recall there's a formula to calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock. The formula is:\n\nAngle = |(30 * H) - (5.5 * M)|\n\nWhere H is the hour and M is the minutes.\n\nGiven that, for 3:30, H = 3 and M = 30.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAngle = |(30 * 3) - (5.5 * 30)|\n\nCalculate inside the absolute value:\n\n= |90 - 165|\n\n= |-75|\n\n= 75 degrees\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another method.\n\nEach hour, the hour hand moves 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours).\n\nEach minute, the minute hand moves 6 degrees (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\nEach minute, the hour hand also moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees per hour / 60 minutes).\n\nAt 3:00 PM, the hour hand is at 90 degrees.\n\nIn 30 minutes, the hour hand moves an additional 0.5 degrees per minute * 30 minutes = 15 degrees.\n\nSo, hour hand position at 3:30 PM is 90 + 15 = 105 degrees.\n\nMinute hand at 30 minutes is at 30 * 6 = 180 degrees.\n\nDifference is 180 - 105 = 75 degrees.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about how much the hour hand has moved beyond the 3-hour mark.\n\nEach hour, the hour hand is at H*30 degrees.\n\nBut since minutes have passed, we need to add (M/60)*30 degrees to the hour hand's position.\n\nSo, hour hand position = (3*30) + (30/60)*30 = 90 + 15 = 105 degrees.\n\nMinute hand position = M*6 = 30*6 = 180 degrees.\n\nDifference is again 75 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the hour and minute hands at exactly 3:30 PM is 75 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75^\\circ} \\]"
