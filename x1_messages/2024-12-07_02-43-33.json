Are you perhaps describing a character from a story or a myth? Maybe a wizard or a sage? The red robe could symbolize wisdom or magic, and the staff is often a sign of authority or magical power. The stone in your throat is interesting; maybe it's a symbol of truth or a communication tool? It's a vivid image you're painting here. Can you tell me more about this character or the context in which you're describing yourself this way?"
