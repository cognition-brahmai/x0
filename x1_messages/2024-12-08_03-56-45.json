Haikus traditionally follow a 5-7-5 syllable structure and often capture a moment in nature. Given the requirement to include words containing both 'z' and 'k', I've chosen words like \"kazoo\", \"kazak\", and \"zakuska\" to fit into this poetic form.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\nIn the hush of night,\nKazaks dance beneath the moon,\nZakuska's delight.\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Kazaks\" refers to people from Kazakhstan, but here, I've imagined them dancing in the snow, adding a cultural element.\n- \"Zakuska\" is a type of appetizer in Russian cuisine, which I've used to suggest a moment of enjoyment or feast amidst the snowy scene.\n\nI hope this meets the requirements!"
