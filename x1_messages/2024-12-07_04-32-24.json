        "content": "Fauvism, which emerged in the early 20th century, was characterized by the use of bold, vibrant, and non-naturalistic colors. The term \"Fauves\" means \"wild beasts\" in French, which was coined by critics due to the artists' energetic and uninhibited approach to color. Fauvist paintings often featured intense hues applied in a direct and expressive manner, emphasizing the emotional impact of color over realistic representation. Notable Fauvist artists include Henri Matisse, Andr\u00e9 Derain, and Maurice de Vlaminck."
