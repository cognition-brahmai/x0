        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a rectangular garden that's 12 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I want to build a walkway around it with a uniform width. The area of the walkway should be equal to the area of the garden. I need to find out what the width of the walkway should be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a garden with dimensions 12m by 8m. Around this garden, I'm going to build a walkway that has the same area as the garden itself. The walkway will have a uniform width, which means it's the same width all the way around the garden.\n\nSo, if I let the width of the walkway be \\( x \\) meters, then the overall dimensions of the garden plus the walkway will be:\n\n- Length: \\( 12 + 2x \\) meters (since the walkway adds \\( x \\) meters on both sides of the length)\n\n- Width: \\( 8 + 2x \\) meters (similarly, \\( x \\) meters on both sides of the width)\n\nThe area of the entire garden plus walkway will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total area} = (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) \\]\n\nThe area of the garden alone is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Garden area} = 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nThe area of the walkway will be the total area minus the garden area:\n\n\\[ \\text{Walkway area} = (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) - 96 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the area of the walkway is equal to the area of the garden:\n\n\\[ (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) - 96 = 96 \\]\n\nSo, I need to solve for \\( x \\) in this equation.\n\nFirst, let's expand the left side:\n\n\\[ (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) = 12 \\times 8 + 12 \\times 2x + 2x \\times 8 + 2x \\times 2x \\]\n\\[ = 96 + 24x + 16x + 4x^2 \\]\n\\[ = 4x^2 + 40x + 96 \\]\n\nNow, subtract the garden area:\n\n\\[ 4x^2 + 40x + 96 - 96 = 4x^2 + 40x \\]\n\nSet this equal to the walkway area, which is equal to the garden area:\n\n\\[ 4x^2 + 40x = 96 \\]\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ 4x^2 + 40x - 96 = 0 \\]\n\nI can simplify this by dividing all terms by 4:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 10x - 24 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\). I can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 10 \\), and \\( c = -24 \\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{10^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-24)}}{2 \\times 1} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 + 96}}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-10 \\pm 14}{2} \\]\n\nThis gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{-10 + 14}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\) meters\n\n2. \\( x = \\frac{-10 - 14}{2} = \\frac{-24}{2} = -12 \\) meters\n\nSince a width cannot be negative, the acceptable solution is \\( x = 2 \\) meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\n\\[ (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) - 96 = 96 \\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[ 96 + 24x + 16x + 4x^2 - 96 = 96 \\]\n\\[ 4x^2 + 40x = 96 \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ 4x^2 + 40x - 96 = 0 \\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 10x - 24 = 0 \\]\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 + 96}}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-10 \\pm 14}{2} \\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 2 \\) or \\( x = -12 \\). Again, \\( x = 2 \\) is the valid solution.\n\nLet me verify this solution by plugging it back into the original problem.\n\nIf \\( x = 2 \\) meters, then:\n\n- Total length: \\( 12 + 2 \\times 2 = 16 \\) meters\n\n- Total width: \\( 8 + 2 \\times 2 = 12 \\) meters\n\n- Total area: \\( 16 \\times 12 = 192 \\) m\u00b2\n\n- Garden area: \\( 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\) m\u00b2\n\n- Walkway area: \\( 192 - 96 = 96 \\) m\u00b2\n\nIndeed, the walkway area equals the garden area, so \\( x = 2 \\) meters is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solve this problem, like setting up the equation differently or using geometry properties. It's always good to cross-verify with another method.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the walkway as a frame around the garden. The area of the frame is equal to the area of the garden.\n\nThe area of the frame can be calculated as the perimeter of the garden multiplied by the width of the walkway plus the corners, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the walkway surrounding the garden, adding \\( x \\) meters on all sides.\n\nThe area of the walkway can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{walkway area} = 2 \\times 12 \\times x + 2 \\times 8 \\times x + 4x^2 \\]\n\nThis accounts for the two lengths and two widths of the walkway, plus the four corner squares.\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ \\text{walkway area} = 24x + 16x + 4x^2 = 4x^2 + 40x \\]\n\nSet this equal to the garden area:\n\n\\[ 4x^2 + 40x = 96 \\]\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So, this confirms the earlier approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the overall area being twice the garden area since the walkway area equals the garden area.\n\nThe total area should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{total area} = \\text{garden area} + \\text{walkway area} = 96 + 96 = 192 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nGiven that the total area is \\( (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) \\), set equal to 192:\n\n\\[ (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) = 192 \\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[ 96 + 24x + 16x + 4x^2 = 192 \\]\n\\[ 4x^2 + 40x + 96 = 192 \\]\n\nSubtract 192 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 4x^2 + 40x - 96 = 0 \\]\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So, again, \\( x = 2 \\) meters is the valid solution.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the increase in area due to the walkway. The walkway adds area around the garden uniformly.\n\nThe garden is 12m by 8m, and the walkway has a uniform width \\( x \\). The total area including the walkway is \\( (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) \\), and the walkway area is equal to the garden area, which is 96 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, setting up the equation as:\n\n\\[ (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) - 96 = 96 \\]\n\nleads to the same quadratic equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use differentiation or other calculus concepts, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nGiven that the quadratic equation leads to a straightforward solution, and multiple approaches confirm \\( x = 2 \\) meters, I can confidently conclude that the width of the walkway should be 2 meters.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any constraints or if another solution might make sense.\n\nFor example, if the walkway is too wide, it might not make practical sense, but in this case, \\( x = 2 \\) meters seems reasonable for a walkway around a garden.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the walkway does not make the total dimensions negative or unrealistic is important, but in this case, it's not an issue.\n\nTherefore, the width of the walkway should be 2 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
