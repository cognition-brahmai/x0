        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to implement this \"BankAccount\" class in C++ as per your request. I'm a bit rusty on C++, but I think I can handle this. So, first things first, I need to define a class called \"BankAccount\" with some member variables: account number, account holder's name, and balance.\n\nI should probably make the account number and account holder's name private to encapsulate the data and provide public methods to access and modify them. For the balance, I'll also make it private and provide methods to deposit and withdraw money, as well as to display the account details.\n\nLet me think about the data types. Account number should probably be an integer, account holder's name a string, and balance a double to handle decimal amounts.\n\nOkay, so in C++, to define a class, I use the class keyword, followed by the class name, and then curly braces to enclose the member variables and methods.\n\nI need to define the constructor to initialize the account number, name, and balance. Also, I should probably have getter and setter methods for the account number and name, but maybe not for the balance, since it's managed through deposit and withdraw methods.\n\nFor depositing money, I'll create a method called deposit that takes a double parameter representing the amount to deposit and adds it to the balance.\n\nFor withdrawing money, I'll create a method called withdraw that takes a double parameter representing the amount to withdraw and subtracts it from the balance. But I should also check if the balance is sufficient before allowing a withdrawal.\n\nAnd for displaying account details, I'll create a method called display that prints out the account number, name, and current balance.\n\nIn the main function, I need to create multiple instances of the BankAccount class and perform operations like depositing and withdrawing money, and displaying the account details.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline:\n\nClass BankAccount {\n\nprivate:\n\nint accountNumber;\n\nstd::string accountHolderName;\n\ndouble balance;\n\npublic:\n\n// Constructor\n\nBankAccount(int accNum, std::string name, double initialBalance);\n\n// Getter and setter for account number and name\n\nint getAccountNumber();\n\nstd::string getAccountHolderName();\n\nvoid setAccountHolderName(std::string name);\n\n// Methods for deposit and withdraw\n\nvoid deposit(double amount);\n\nvoid withdraw(double amount);\n\n// Method to display account details\n\nvoid display();\n\n};\n\nIn the main function:\n\nint main() {\n\n// Create instances of BankAccount\n\nBankAccount acc1(12345, \"John Doe\", 1000.0);\n\nBankAccount acc2(67890, \"Jane Smith\", 1500.0);\n\n// Perform operations\n\nacc1.deposit(500.0);\n\nacc2.withdraw(200.0);\n\nacc1.display();\n\nacc2.display();\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\nI think that covers the basic requirements. Now, I need to fill in the details for each method.\n\nStarting with the constructor:\n\nBankAccount::BankAccount(int accNum, std::string name, double initialBalance) {\n\naccountNumber = accNum;\n\naccountHolderName = name;\n\nbalance = initialBalance;\n\n}\n\nThen, the getter and setter methods:\n\nint BankAccount::getAccountNumber() {\n\nreturn accountNumber;\n\n}\n\nstd::string BankAccount::getAccountHolderName() {\n\nreturn accountHolderName;\n\n}\n\nvoid BankAccount::setAccountHolderName(std::string name) {\n\naccountHolderName = name;\n\n}\n\nFor deposit:\n\nvoid BankAccount::deposit(double amount) {\n\nif(amount > 0) {\n\nbalance += amount;\n\n} else {\n\nstd::cout << \"Invalid deposit amount.\" << std::endl;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nFor withdraw:\n\nvoid BankAccount::withdraw(double amount) {\n\nif(amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {\n\nbalance -= amount;\n\n} else {\n\nstd::cout << \"Invalid withdrawal amount or insufficient balance.\" << std::endl;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nAnd for display:\n\nvoid BankAccount::display() {\n\nstd::cout << \"Account Number: \" << accountNumber << std::endl;\n\nstd::cout << \"Account Holder Name: \" << accountHolderName << std::endl;\n\nstd::cout << \"Balance: $\" << balance << std::endl;\n\n}\n\nThat should cover all the required methods.\n\nIn the main function, I need to include iostream and string headers, and use the std namespace.\n\nAlso, I should make sure to handle cases where withdrawal amounts are invalid or exceed the balance, which I've already done in the withdraw method.\n\nMaybe I can add more operations in the main function to demonstrate more functionality, like changing the account holder's name using the setter method.\n\nHere's an updated main function:\n\nint main() {\n\n// Create instances of BankAccount\n\nBankAccount acc1(12345, \"John Doe\", 1000.0);\n\nBankAccount acc2(67890, \"Jane Smith\", 1500.0);\n\n// Deposit money\n\nacc1.deposit(500.0);\n\nacc2.deposit(300.0);\n\n// Withdraw money\n\nacc1.withdraw(200.0);\n\nacc2.withdraw(200.0);\n\n// Display account details\n\nacc1.display();\n\nacc2.display();\n\n// Change account holder's name\n\nacc1.setAccountHolderName(\"John Doe Smith\");\n\nacc1.display();\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\nThis should show how to create objects, perform deposits and withdrawals, and modify account holder's name.\n\nI should also consider adding some error checking or messages in case of invalid operations, which I've somewhat covered in the withdraw method.\n\nMaybe I can improve the display method to make it more user-friendly, like formatting the balance to two decimal places.\n\nTo do that, I can use std::fixed and std::setprecision from <iomanip> header.\n\nFirst, include <iomanip>:\n\n#include <iomanip>\n\nThen, in the display method:\n\nvoid BankAccount::display() {\n\nstd::cout << \"Account Number: \" << accountNumber << std::endl;\n\nstd::cout << \"Account Holder Name: \" << accountHolderName << std::endl;\n\nstd::cout << \"Balance: $\" << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2) << balance << std::endl;\n\n}\n\nThis will ensure the balance is displayed with two decimal places.\n\nAlso, in the main function, make sure to include <iomanip> and use the std namespace.\n\nAlright, I think this is shaping up well. Let me compile this in my mind.\n\nClass definition:\n\n- Private members: accountNumber (int), accountHolderName (std::string), balance (double)\n\n- Public methods: constructor, getAccountNumber, getAccountHolderName, setAccountHolderName, deposit, withdraw, display\n\nMain function:\n\n- Include necessary headers: iostream, string, iomanip\n\n- Use std namespace\n\n- Create BankAccount objects\n\n- Perform deposits and withdrawals\n\n- Display account details\n\n- Change account holder's name and display again\n\nI should also consider if there are any possible improvements or additional features to add, but for the basic requirements, this should suffice.\n\nMaybe I can add a method to transfer money from one account to another, but that might be beyond the scope of the current task.\n\nFor now, I'll stick to the original requirements.\n\nLet me write the complete code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement a `BankAccount` class in C++ with member variables for account number, account holder's name, and balance. We also need to include methods for depositing money, withdrawing money, and displaying account details. Additionally, a `main` function is required to demonstrate the usage of this class by creating multiple instances and performing various operations.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Class Definition:**\n   - **Private Members:** `accountNumber` (int), `accountHolderName` (std::string), and `balance` (double).\n   - **Public Methods:**\n     - Constructor to initialize the account details.\n     - Getter methods for account number and account holder's name.\n     - Setter method for account holder's name.\n     - `deposit` method to add money to the balance.\n     - `withdraw` method to subtract money from the balance with checks for sufficient balance.\n     - `display` method to print account details.\n\n2. **Main Function:**\n   - Create instances of the `BankAccount` class.\n   - Perform deposit and withdrawal operations.\n   - Display account details after operations.\n   - Demonstrate modification of account holder's name.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <iomanip>\n\nclass BankAccount {\nprivate:\n    int accountNumber;\n    std::string accountHolderName;\n    double balance;\n\npublic:\n    // Constructor\n    BankAccount(int accNum, std::string name, double initialBalance)\n        : accountNumber(accNum), accountHolderName(name), balance(initialBalance) {}\n\n    // Getter methods\n    int getAccountNumber() const {\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n\n    std::string getAccountHolderName() const {\n        return accountHolderName;\n    }\n\n    // Setter method\n    void setAccountHolderName(std::string name) {\n        accountHolderName = name;\n    }\n\n    // Methods for deposit and withdraw\n    void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Invalid deposit amount.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n\n    void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {\n            balance -= amount;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Invalid withdrawal amount or insufficient balance.\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to display account details\n    void display() const {\n        std::cout << \"Account Number: \" << accountNumber << std::endl;\n        std::cout << \"Account Holder Name: \" << accountHolderName << std::endl;\n        std::cout << \"Balance: $\" << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2) << balance << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    // Create instances of BankAccount\n    BankAccount acc1(12345, \"John Doe\", 1000.0);\n    BankAccount acc2(67890, \"Jane Smith\", 1500.0);\n\n    // Deposit money\n    acc1.deposit(500.0);\n    acc2.deposit(300.0);\n\n    // Withdraw money\n    acc1.withdraw(200.0);\n    acc2.withdraw(200.0);\n\n    // Display account details\n    acc1.display();\n    acc2.display();\n\n    // Change account holder's name\n    acc1.setAccountHolderName(\"John Doe Smith\");\n    acc1.display();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Class BankAccount:**\n  - **Constructor:** Initializes account number, name, and balance.\n  - **Getter Methods:** Provide access to account number and name.\n  - **Setter Method:** Allows changing the account holder's name.\n  - **deposit and withdraw Methods:** Manage the balance with appropriate checks.\n  - **display Method:** Outputs the account details in a formatted manner.\n\n- **Main Function:**\n  - Creates two `BankAccount` objects.\n  - Performs deposits and withdrawals.\n  - Displays account details before and after modifications to demonstrate class functionality.\n\nThis implementation ensures encapsulation and basic validation for deposit and withdrawal operations, providing a simple model of a bank account system."
