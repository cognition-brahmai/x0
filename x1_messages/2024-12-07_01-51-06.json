        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To interact with a Cassandra database in Python, we typically use the `cassandra-driver` package. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install cassandra-driver\n```\n\nOnce you have the package installed, you can write a Python script to connect to your Cassandra database, query the user information table, and filter users based on a specified age range.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Connect to the Cassandra Cluster:**\n   You need to establish a connection to your Cassandra cluster. You'll need the contact points (IP addresses or hostnames of your Cassandra nodes) and the keyspace you're working with.\n\n2. **Create a Session:**\n   A session is used to execute queries against the Cassandra cluster.\n\n3. **Prepare and Execute the Query:**\n   Prepare a CQL (Cassandra Query Language) query to select users within the specified age range.\n\n4. **Fetch and Filter the Results:**\n   Execute the query and fetch the results. You can then filter the users based on the age range provided.\n\n5. **Close the Session and Cluster:**\n   Make sure to close the session and the cluster connection when you're done to free up resources.\n\nHere's a sample Python script that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom cassandra.cluster import Cluster\nfrom cassandra.query import SimpleStatement\n\ndef connect_to_cassandra(contact_points, keyspace):\n    cluster = Cluster(contact_points)\n    session = cluster.connect(keyspace)\n    return session, cluster\n\ndef fetch_users_in_age_range(session, min_age, max_age):\n    query = f\"SELECT name, email, age FROM users WHERE age >= {min_age} AND age <= {max_age}\"\n    statement = SimpleStatement(query)\n    rows = session.execute(statement)\n    return rows\n\ndef main():\n    contact_points = ['127.0.0.1']  # Replace with your Cassandra node's IP\n    keyspace = 'your_keyspace'  # Replace with your keyspace name\n    min_age = 20  # Define your minimum age\n    max_age = 30  # Define your maximum age\n\n    session, cluster = connect_to_cassandra(contact_points, keyspace)\n    users = fetch_users_in_age_range(session, min_age, max_age)\n\n    for user in users:\n        print(f\"Name: {user.name}, Email: {user.email}, Age: {user.age}\")\n\n    session.shutdown()\n    cluster.shutdown()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Connecting to Cassandra:**\n   - `Cluster(contact_points)`: Creates a cluster connection to the Cassandra nodes specified in `contact_points`.\n   - `cluster.connect(keyspace)`: Creates a session connected to the specified keyspace.\n\n2. **Fetching Users:**\n   - `fetch_users_in_age_range`: Constructs a CQL query to select users within the given age range and executes it using `session.execute`.\n\n3. **Printing Users:**\n   - Iterates through the result rows and prints user details.\n\n4. **Closing Connections:**\n   - `session.shutdown()`: Closes the session.\n   - `cluster.shutdown()`: Shuts down the cluster connection.\n\nMake sure to replace `'127.0.0.1'` with the actual IP addresses of your Cassandra nodes and `'your_keyspace'` with the name of your keyspace.\n\nThis script assumes that you have a table named `users` with columns `name`, `email`, and `age`. Adjust the table and column names as per your schema.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
