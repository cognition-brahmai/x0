        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a rectangular room is 12 feet long and 9 feet wide, and I need to find out the area of the floor in square yards. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that area is calculated by multiplying length by width. So, for a rectangle, area equals length times width. That makes sense. So, if the room is 12 feet long and 9 feet wide, the area in square feet would be 12 feet times 9 feet, which is 108 square feet.\n\nBut the question asks for the area in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards. Hmm, I remember that 1 yard equals 3 feet. So, to convert feet to yards, I would divide by 3. But since we're dealing with area, it's square feet to square yards, so I think I need to square the conversion factor.\n\nLet me think about this. If 1 yard is 3 feet, then 1 square yard is 3 feet by 3 feet, which is 9 square feet. So, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet. Therefore, to convert square feet to square yards, I should divide the number of square feet by 9.\n\nSo, if the area is 108 square feet, divided by 9 square feet per square yard, that would be 12 square yards. Wait, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLet me double-check. Another way to approach this is to convert the dimensions from feet to yards before multiplying. So, 12 feet divided by 3 equals 4 yards, and 9 feet divided by 3 equals 3 yards. Then, the area would be 4 yards times 3 yards, which is 12 square yards. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the area of the floor is 12 square yards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
