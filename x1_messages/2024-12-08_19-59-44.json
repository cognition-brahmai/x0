        "content": "So the national railway operator wants to upgrade its fleet by buying new high-speed trains. Let's break down the information given and solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, the current fleet consists of 100 trains, each with a capacity of 400 passengers. So, the total current capacity is:\n\nTotal current capacity = Number of current trains \u00d7 Capacity per train\nTotal current capacity = 100 \u00d7 400\nTotal current capacity = 40,000 passengers\n\nNow, the company plans to replace 30% of its existing fleet with new trains that have a capacity of 500 passengers each. Let's find out how many trains that is:\n\nNumber of trains to be replaced = 30% of 100\nNumber of trains to be replaced = 0.30 \u00d7 100\nNumber of trains to be replaced = 30 trains\n\nSo, they're going to replace 30 trains with new ones that can carry 500 passengers each.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the capacity of the remaining old trains:\n\nNumber of old trains remaining = Total current trains - Number of trains replaced\nNumber of old trains remaining = 100 - 30\nNumber of old trains remaining = 70 trains\n\nTotal capacity of remaining old trains = Number of old trains remaining \u00d7 Capacity per old train\nTotal capacity of remaining old trains = 70 \u00d7 400\nTotal capacity of remaining old trains = 28,000 passengers\n\nNow, let's calculate the total capacity of the new trains:\n\nTotal capacity of new trains = Number of new trains \u00d7 Capacity per new train\nTotal capacity of new trains = 30 \u00d7 500\nTotal capacity of new trains = 15,000 passengers\n\nNow, the total capacity of the upgraded fleet will be the sum of the remaining old trains and the new trains:\n\nTotal upgraded capacity = Total capacity of remaining old trains + Total capacity of new trains\nTotal upgraded capacity = 28,000 + 15,000\nTotal upgraded capacity = 43,000 passengers\n\nNow, we need to find the overall change in passenger capacity:\n\nChange in capacity = Total upgraded capacity - Total current capacity\nChange in capacity = 43,000 - 40,000\nChange in capacity = 3,000 passengers\n\nSo, the upgraded fleet can accommodate 3,000 more passengers in total.\n\nBut the question also asks for how many additional passengers the upgraded fleet can accommodate on their busiest route, which typically utilizes 90% of the available capacity.\n\nFirst, let's find out what 90% of the current and upgraded capacities are.\n\nCurrent capacity at 90%:\n\nCurrent capacity at 90% = Total current capacity \u00d7 90%\nCurrent capacity at 90% = 40,000 \u00d7 0.90\nCurrent capacity at 90% = 36,000 passengers\n\nUpgraded capacity at 90%:\n\nUpgraded capacity at 90% = Total upgraded capacity \u00d7 90%\nUpgraded capacity at 90% = 43,000 \u00d7 0.90\nUpgraded capacity at 90% = 38,700 passengers\n\nNow, the additional passengers the upgraded fleet can accommodate on the busiest route is the difference between the upgraded capacity at 90% and the current capacity at 90%:\n\nAdditional passengers on busiest route = Upgraded capacity at 90% - Current capacity at 90%\nAdditional passengers on busiest route = 38,700 - 36,000\nAdditional passengers on busiest route = 2,700 passengers\n\nSo, the upgraded fleet can accommodate 2,700 additional passengers on their busiest route when operating at 90% capacity.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't miss anything.\n\nWe started with 100 trains of 400 passengers each, totaling 40,000 passengers.\n\nReplaced 30% (30 trains) with new trains of 500 passengers each.\n\nRemaining old trains: 70 \u00d7 400 = 28,000\n\nNew trains: 30 \u00d7 500 = 15,000\n\nTotal upgraded capacity: 28,000 + 15,000 = 43,000\n\nChange in capacity: 43,000 - 40,000 = 3,000\n\nAt 90% capacity:\n\nCurrent: 40,000 \u00d7 0.90 = 36,000\n\nUpgraded: 43,000 \u00d7 0.90 = 38,700\n\nAdditional passengers: 38,700 - 36,000 = 2,700\n\nSeems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2700} \\]"
