        "content": "So I have this Laplace transform, F(s) = 1/(s\u00b2 + 4s + 13), and I need to find the inverse Laplace transform, which is f(t). I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but I remember that the inverse Laplace transform essentially converts a function in the s-domain back to the time domain.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties and formulas of Laplace transforms. I know that the Laplace transform of e^(-at) * sin(bt) is b/[(s+a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2], and similarly, the transform of e^(-at) * cos(bt) is (s+a)/[(s+a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2]. Maybe I can manipulate F(s) to look like one of these forms.\n\nLooking at the denominator, s\u00b2 + 4s + 13, I think I can complete the square to make it look like (s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2. Let's try that.\n\ns\u00b2 + 4s + 13:\n\nI take the coefficient of s, which is 4, divide by 2 to get 2, and then square it to get 4. So, s\u00b2 + 4s + 4 is (s + 2)\u00b2, and then I have to adjust for the +13.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 + 4s + 13 = (s + 2)\u00b2 + 9, because (s + 2)\u00b2 = s\u00b2 + 4s + 4, and then adding 9 gives s\u00b2 + 4s + 13.\n\nSo, F(s) = 1/[(s + 2)\u00b2 + 9].\n\nNow, 9 is equal to 3\u00b2, so I can write it as:\n\nF(s) = 1/[(s + 2)\u00b2 + 3\u00b2].\n\nComparing this to the Laplace transform of e^(-at) * sin(bt), which is b/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2], I see that a = 2 and b = 3.\n\nWait, but in that formula, it's b/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2], and here I have 1/[(s + 2)\u00b2 + 3\u00b2]. So, it's not exactly matching. Maybe I need to adjust it.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the Laplace transform of e^(-at) * cos(bt) is (s + a)/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2]. But again, that doesn't match my numerator, which is 1.\n\nHmm, maybe I can write 1 as (s + 2)/(s + 2), but that seems messy. Wait, no, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider partial fractions, but since the denominator is irreducible (it's a sum of squares), that might not work directly.\n\nLet me check if there's a formula for the inverse Laplace transform of 1/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2]. It seems like it should be related to e^(-at) * (1/b) * sin(bt), but I need to confirm.\n\nActually, I think the inverse Laplace transform of 1/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2] is (1/b) * e^(-at) * sin(bt).\n\nYes, that makes sense because the Laplace transform of sin(bt) is b/(s\u00b2 + b\u00b2), and with the exponential shift, it becomes b/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2]. But in my case, I have 1/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2], so it seems like I need to adjust for that.\n\nSo, if L{e^(-at) * sin(bt)} = b/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2], then L{e^(-at) * (1/b) * sin(bt)} = 1/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2].\n\nTherefore, the inverse Laplace transform of 1/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2] is e^(-at) * (1/b) * sin(bt).\n\nIn my problem, a = 2 and b = 3, so f(t) = e^(-2t) * (1/3) * sin(3t).\n\nSimplifying, f(t) = (1/3) * e^(-2t) * sin(3t).\n\nWait, but I should make sure that this is correct. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nI know that L^{-1}{b/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2]} = e^(-at) * sin(bt).\n\nSo, if I have 1/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2], that's equivalent to (1/b) * [b/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2]], so the inverse Laplace transform would be (1/b) * e^(-at) * sin(bt).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, f(t) = (1/3) * e^(-2t) * sin(3t).\n\nAlternatively, if there are any initial conditions or other factors to consider, but since they're not specified, I'll assume this is the straightforward case.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the definition of the inverse Laplace transform, which involves complex integration, but that's beyond the scope of most undergraduate engineering courses, and it's quite tedious to compute directly.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a table of Laplace transforms and try to match the given F(s) to one of the entries.\n\nLooking up a Laplace transform table, I find that:\n\nL{e^(-at) * sin(bt)} = b/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2]\n\nand\n\nL{e^(-at) * cos(bt)} = (s + a)/[(s + a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2]\n\nSo, again, comparing F(s) = 1/[(s + 2)\u00b2 + 3\u00b2], I can see that it matches with (1/b) * L{e^(-at) * sin(bt)}.\n\nTherefore, f(t) = (1/3) * e^(-2t) * sin(3t).\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other terms or if the denominator can be factored differently.\n\nThe denominator s\u00b2 + 4s + 13 is irreducible over the real numbers since the discriminant (4\u00b2 - 4*1*13) = 16 - 52 = -36, which is negative. So, it doesn't factor into real linear terms, confirming that the approach I took is appropriate.\n\nAlso, I should check if there are any restrictions on s, but since the Laplace transform is typically considered for s with positive real part, and the denominator doesn't have any real roots, it should be fine.\n\nTherefore, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = 1/(s\u00b2 + 4s + 13) is f(t) = (1/3) * e^(-2t) * sin(3t).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{f(t) = \\dfrac{1}{3} e^{-2t} \\sin(3t)} \\]"
