        "content": "Let's see. There's this puzzle about a girl who has as many brothers as sisters, but each brother has only half as many brothers as sisters. I need to figure out how many brothers and sisters there are in the family.\n\nFirst, I should probably define some variables to make sense of this. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of girls in the family.\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of boys in the family.\n\nSo, the total number of siblings is \\( g + b \\).\n\nNow, the problem says that the girl has as many brothers as sisters. So, for this girl, her brothers are all the boys in the family, and her sisters are all the other girls except herself.\n\nWait, no. Actually, her brothers are the boys, and her sisters are the other girls. So, the number of brothers she has is \\( b \\), and the number of sisters she has is \\( g - 1 \\) (since she's not counting herself).\n\nAccording to the problem, these are equal:\n\n\\[ b = g - 1 \\]\n\nOkay, that's one equation.\n\nNext, it says that each brother has only half as many brothers as sisters. So, for a brother, his brothers are the other boys except himself, and his sisters are all the girls.\n\nSo, the number of brothers each boy has is \\( b - 1 \\), and the number of sisters is \\( g \\).\n\nAnd according to the problem, the number of brothers is half the number of sisters:\n\n\\[ b - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} g \\]\n\nOkay, now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( b = g - 1 \\)\n\n2. \\( b - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} g \\)\n\nI can solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nLet me substitute the first equation into the second.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( b = g - 1 \\)\n\nPlug this into equation 2:\n\n\\( (g - 1) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} g \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( g - 2 = \\frac{1}{2} g \\)\n\nNow, subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2} g \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( g - \\frac{1}{2} g - 2 = 0 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2} g - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2} g = 2 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( g = 4 \\)\n\nNow, plug this back into equation 1:\n\n\\( b = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n\nSo, there are 4 girls and 3 boys in the family.\n\nLet me double-check this.\n\nIf there are 4 girls and 3 boys:\n\n- For a girl, her brothers are the 3 boys, and her sisters are the other 3 girls (since she's not counting herself). So, brothers equal sisters: 3 = 3. That checks out.\n\n- For a boy, his brothers are the other 2 boys (since he's not counting himself), and his sisters are the 4 girls. So, brothers are half the number of sisters: 2 = half of 4. That also checks out.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ girls and } 3 \\text{ boys}} \\]\n"
