        "content": "So the farmer has 200 acres of land and he wants to plant three types of crops: A, B, and C. He plans to allocate 60% of his land to crop A, 25% to crop B, and 15% to crop C. To find out how many acres that corresponds to for each crop, we need to calculate the percentages of the total land.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many acres are allocated to crop A. Since it's 60% of the total land, we can calculate it by taking 60% of 200 acres. Remember that percent means per hundred, so 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.60 in decimal form.\n\nSo, acres for crop A = 0.60 * 200 acres.\n\nSimilarly, for crop B, which is 25% of the land:\n\nAcres for crop B = 0.25 * 200 acres.\n\nAnd for crop C, which is 15%:\n\nAcres for crop C = 0.15 * 200 acres.\n\nLet me do these calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, crop A:\n\n0.60 * 200 = 120 acres.\n\nNext, crop B:\n\n0.25 * 200 = 50 acres.\n\nFinally, crop C:\n\n0.15 * 200 = 30 acres.\n\nSo, the farmer should allocate 120 acres for crop A, 50 acres for crop B, and 30 acres for crop C.\n\nJust to double-check, let's add these up to ensure they total the 200 acres.\n\n120 + 50 = 170 acres.\n\n170 + 30 = 200 acres.\n\nPerfect, it adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, we could have calculated it using fractions. Since percentages are out of 100, we can also think of them as fractions over 100.\n\nFor crop A: (60/100) * 200 = 120 acres.\n\nCrop B: (25/100) * 200 = 50 acres.\n\nCrop C: (15/100) * 200 = 30 acres.\n\nSame results as before.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to convert the percentages directly into decimals and multiply by the total land area.\n\nAgain, 60% is 0.60, 25% is 0.25, and 15% is 0.15.\n\nSo, it's straightforward: 0.60 * 200 = 120, 0.25 * 200 = 50, and 0.15 * 200 = 30.\n\nAll methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nIt's also good to note that the percentages add up to 100%: 60% + 25% + 15% = 100%.\n\nAnd the acres allocated add up to the total land: 120 + 50 + 30 = 200 acres.\n\nThis consistency helps confirm that the calculations are correct.\n\nIf the farmer had different percentages or a different total land area, the approach would be the same: convert the percentages to decimals and multiply by the total land area.\n\nFor example, if the farmer had 300 acres and wanted to allocate 50% to crop A, 30% to crop B, and 20% to crop C, it would be:\n\nCrop A: 0.50 * 300 = 150 acres.\n\nCrop B: 0.30 * 300 = 90 acres.\n\nCrop C: 0.20 * 300 = 60 acres.\n\nAgain, checking: 150 + 90 + 60 = 300 acres.\n\nSo, the method is consistent regardless of the specific numbers.\n\nIn some cases, the percentages might not add up to exactly 100%, but in this scenario, they do, which makes it straightforward.\n\nIt's also worth considering that in real-life situations, there might be constraints such as minimum or maximum acreage requirements for certain crops, or limitations based on soil type, water availability, etc. But based on the information provided, we can proceed with these allocations.\n\nAdditionally, the farmer might want to consider rotation practices to maintain soil health, but that's beyond the scope of this particular question.\n\nSo, to summarize, the farmer should allocate:\n\n- 120 acres for crop A,\n\n- 50 acres for crop B,\n\n- 30 acres for crop C.\n\nThis allocation is directly derived from the specified percentages of the total land area.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120 \\text{ acres for crop A}, 50 \\text{ acres for crop B}, 30 \\text{ acres for crop C}} \\]"
