The hobbits are a fictional race created by Tolkien, and they are one of the most well-known and beloved aspects of his legendarium. They are described as a diminutive, furry-footed people who are fond of simple pleasures such as good food, drink, and comfortable homes. The Shire is their homeland, a bucolic region in the northwest of the continent of Middle-earth, and it is here that many of the key events of Tolkien's stories, such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings,\" take place."
