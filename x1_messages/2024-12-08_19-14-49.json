        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there's a bus with a certain number of people, and they get off at different stops. Half get off at the first stop, a quarter at the second, and the remaining 5 at the final stop. I need to find out how many were on the bus at the start.\n\nLet me denote the initial number of people as x.\n\nAt the first stop, half get off, so that\u2019s x/2.\n\nAt the second stop, a quarter get off. Now, is this a quarter of the initial number or a quarter of the remaining? The problem says \"a quarter gets off at the second stop,\" without specifying. I think it\u2019s a quarter of the initial number, but maybe it\u2019s a quarter of what\u2019s left after the first stop.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: the quarter is of the initial number.\n\nSo, at the first stop, x/2 get off.\n\nAt the second stop, x/4 get off.\n\nThen, the remaining passengers are x - x/2 - x/4 = x/4.\n\nAnd it says that the remaining 5 get off at the final stop. So, x/4 = 5.\n\nTherefore, x = 5 * 4 = 20.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But wait, maybe the quarter is of the remaining passengers after the first stop.\n\nSecond possibility: the quarter is of the remaining passengers after the first stop.\n\nAt the first stop, x/2 get off, so there are x/2 left.\n\nAt the second stop, a quarter of the remaining get off, which is (x/2)/4 = x/8.\n\nThen, the passengers remaining after the second stop are x/2 - x/8 = 3x/8.\n\nThese 3x/8 get off at the final stop, which is equal to 5.\n\nSo, 3x/8 = 5.\n\nThen, x = (5 * 8)/3 = 40/3 \u2248 13.333.\n\nBut that\u2019s not possible because the number of people can\u2019t be a fraction.\n\nSo, this second possibility leads to an illogical conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the first possibility must be correct: the quarter is of the initial number.\n\nThus, x = 20.\n\nLet me check:\n\nInitial: 20 people.\n\nFirst stop: 20/2 = 10 get off. Remaining: 10.\n\nSecond stop: 20/4 = 5 get off. Remaining: 5.\n\nFinal stop: 5 get off.\n\nThat matches the problem.\n\nAlternatively, if the quarter is of the remaining after the first stop:\n\nInitial: 13.333 people. That doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
