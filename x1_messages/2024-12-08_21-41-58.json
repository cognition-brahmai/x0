        "content": "I'm not sure which Canadian artist you're referring to, but there are several musicians who have been inspired by David Bowie and have paid tribute to him in their own way. One possible candidate could be The Weeknd, who collaborated with Daft Punk on the song \"Starboy,\" which was influenced by Bowie's style and persona. However, I would need more information to confirm this. Can you provide any additional details or context?"
