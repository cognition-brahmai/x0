        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1500 units every day, and each unit requires 8 minutes of labor time. I need to find out how many hours of labor are required per week for this production.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total labor time required per day. Since each unit takes 8 minutes, and they produce 1500 units daily, the total minutes per day would be 1500 units multiplied by 8 minutes per unit. So, 1500 times 8 equals 12,000 minutes per day.\n\nNow, there are 7 days in a week, so to find the total minutes per week, I need to multiply the daily minutes by 7. That would be 12,000 minutes per day times 7 days, which equals 84,000 minutes per week.\n\nBut the question asks for hours of labor per week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I need to convert minutes to hours by dividing the total minutes by 60. So, 84,000 minutes divided by 60 equals 1,400 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- Units per day: 1500\n\n- Minutes per unit: 8\n\n- Total minutes per day: 1500 * 8 = 12,000 minutes\n\n- Days per week: 7\n\n- Total minutes per week: 12,000 * 7 = 84,000 minutes\n\n- Convert minutes to hours: 84,000 / 60 = 1,400 hours\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of hours per day first. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the labor time per unit in hours would be 8/60 hours. So, per unit: 8/60 = 0.1333 hours.\n\nThen, for 1500 units per day: 1500 * 0.1333 \u2248 200 hours per day.\n\nThen, for 7 days: 200 * 7 = 1,400 hours per week.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, so I'm confident that 1,400 hours is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1400} \\]"
