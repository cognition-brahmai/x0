        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a town, 60% of people have dogs, 40% have cats, and 20% have both dogs and cats. I need to find out what percentage of people have neither dogs nor cats.\n\nOkay, so first, I should probably draw a Venn diagram to visualize this. I'll have one circle for dog owners and another for cat owners. The overlap between the two circles will be the people who have both dogs and cats, which is 20%.\n\nSo, the dog circle is 60%, the cat circle is 40%, and the overlap is 20%. To find out how many people have only dogs, I'll subtract the overlap from the dog owners: 60% - 20% = 40%. Similarly, for only cat owners: 40% - 20% = 20%.\n\nNow, if I add up all the people who have either dogs or cats or both, it should be the sum of only dog owners, only cat owners, and both. So that's 40% (only dogs) + 20% (only cats) + 20% (both) = 80%.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't sound right. If 80% have dogs or cats, then 20% have neither. But let me double-check this.\n\nI recall there's a formula for this kind of problem: the inclusion-exclusion principle. It states that to find the total percentage of people who have either dogs or cats, you add the percentages of dog owners and cat owners and then subtract the percentage that owns both, to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, total with dogs or cats = percentage with dogs + percentage with cats - percentage with both.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier. So, 80% of people have either dogs or cats or both.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of people who have neither dogs nor cats is 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any possibility that some people have other pets and that affects this calculation? The problem specifically talks about dog and cat owners, and says 20% have both. It doesn't mention any other types of pets, so I think it's safe to assume that the only pets considered are dogs and cats for this problem.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"neither dogs nor cats,\" so it's clear that I need to find the percentage of people who don't have either of these pets.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider that the total percentage must add up to 100%. So, if 40% have only dogs, 20% have only cats, 20% have both, and 20% have neither, then 40% + 20% + 20% + 20% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number (or percentage) of dog owners,\n\n- n(B) is the number (or percentage) of cat owners,\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number (or percentage) of people who have both dogs and cats.\n\nSo, n(A \u222a B) = 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nThen, the percentage who have neither is 100% - n(A \u222a B) = 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The percentage of people who have neither dogs nor cats is 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
