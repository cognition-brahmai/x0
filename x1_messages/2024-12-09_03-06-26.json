        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A every day for 6 days a week. So first, I need to find out how many units they produce in a week.\n\nUnits per week = Units per day \u00d7 Days per week\nUnits per week = 500 \u00d7 6\nUnits per week = 3,000 units\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total production cost for these 3,000 units. The production cost for each unit is $20.\n\nTotal production cost = Units per week \u00d7 Production cost per unit\nTotal production cost = 3,000 \u00d7 20\nTotal production cost = $60,000\n\nNow, they sell each unit for $35. So, the total revenue from selling 3,000 units would be:\n\nTotal revenue = Units per week \u00d7 Selling price per unit\nTotal revenue = 3,000 \u00d7 35\nTotal revenue = $105,000\n\nTo find the weekly profit, I need to subtract the total production cost from the total revenue.\n\nWeekly profit = Total revenue - Total production cost\nWeekly profit = 105,000 - 60,000\nWeekly profit = $45,000\n\nSo, the factory's weekly profit is $45,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45000} \\]"
