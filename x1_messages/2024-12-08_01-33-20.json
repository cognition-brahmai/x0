First, we need to find out how much profit the company made from selling the small widgets and the large widgets separately, and then add those profits together to get the total profit.\n\nStarting with the small widgets:\n\n- They sold 100 small widgets at $10 each, with a profit margin of 25%.\n\nFirst, we need to find out the total revenue from small widgets:\n\nTotal revenue from small widgets = number of small widgets sold \u00d7 price per small widget\n\nTotal revenue from small widgets = 100 \u00d7 $10 = $1000\n\nNow, the profit margin is 25%, which means that 25% of the revenue is profit.\n\nSo, profit from small widgets = 25% of $1000\n\nTo calculate 25% of $1000:\n\n(25/100) \u00d7 $1000 = 0.25 \u00d7 $1000 = $250\n\nSo, the profit from small widgets is $250.\n\nNext, the large widgets:\n\n- They sold 50 large widgets at $20 each, with a profit margin of 40%.\n\nFirst, find the total revenue from large widgets:\n\nTotal revenue from large widgets = number of large widgets sold \u00d7 price per large widget\n\nTotal revenue from large widgets = 50 \u00d7 $20 = $1000\n\nThe profit margin is 40%, so profit from large widgets = 40% of $1000\n\nCalculate 40% of $1000:\n\n(40/100) \u00d7 $1000 = 0.40 \u00d7 $1000 = $400\n\nSo, the profit from large widgets is $400.\n\nNow, to find the total profit, we add the profits from both types of widgets:\n\nTotal profit = profit from small widgets + profit from large widgets\n\nTotal profit = $250 + $400 = $650\n\nTherefore, the company's total profit from selling both small and large widgets is $650.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{650} \\]"
