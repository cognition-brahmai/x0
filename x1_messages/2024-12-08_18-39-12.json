        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 houses in the village, and each house has 4 windows. So, first, I need to find out the total number of windows in the village before the storm.\n\nTotal windows = number of houses \u00d7 windows per house\nTotal windows = 20 \u00d7 4 = 80 windows\n\nNow, during the storm, one window in each house is broken. Since there are 20 houses, that means 20 windows are broken in total.\n\nBroken windows = number of houses \u00d7 1 window per house\nBroken windows = 20 \u00d7 1 = 20 windows\n\nTo find the number of unbroken windows, I subtract the broken windows from the total windows.\n\nUnbroken windows = total windows \u2212 broken windows\nUnbroken windows = 80 \u2212 20 = 60 windows\n\nSo, there are 60 unbroken windows left after the storm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
