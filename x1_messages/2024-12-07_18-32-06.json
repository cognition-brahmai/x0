        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are two types of widgets, Type A and Type B. The profit for each Type A is $3, and for Type B, it's $5. The store sold a total of 100 widgets and made $420 in profit. I need to find out how many of each type were sold.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up some equations based on the information given. Let's say:\n\n- Let x be the number of Type A widgets sold.\n\n- Let y be the number of Type B widgets sold.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that:\n\n1. The total number of widgets sold is 100, so x + y = 100.\n\n2. The total profit is $420, and since Type A widgets bring in $3 each and Type B widgets bring in $5 each, the profit equation would be 3x + 5y = 420.\n\nSo, I have a system of two equations:\n\n(1) x + y = 100\n\n(2) 3x + 5y = 420\n\nI need to solve for x and y.\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. I can solve equation (1) for one variable and substitute it into equation (2).\n\nLet's solve equation (1) for x:\n\nx = 100 - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into equation (2):\n\n3(100 - y) + 5y = 420\n\nNow, distribute the 3:\n\n300 - 3y + 5y = 420\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300 + 2y = 420\n\nNow, subtract 300 from both sides:\n\n2y = 120\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ny = 60\n\nNow that I have y, which is the number of Type B widgets, I can find x by plugging y back into the equation x = 100 - y:\n\nx = 100 - 60 = 40\n\nSo, the store sold 40 Type A widgets and 60 Type B widgets.\n\nBut, I should check if this makes sense. Let's verify the total profit:\n\n(40 widgets * $3) + (60 widgets * $5) = 120 + 300 = $420\n\nYes, that matches the total profit given. Also, 40 + 60 = 100 widgets, which matches the total number of widgets sold.\n\nAlternatively, I could have solved this using elimination or graphing, but substitution worked fine here.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using ratios or something like that?\n\nWell, thinking about the profits, Type A brings in $3 per widget, and Type B brings in $5 per widget. The average profit per widget can be calculated as total profit divided by total widgets: $420 / 100 = $4.20 per widget.\n\nSo, the average profit is $4.20 per widget. Since Type A is $3 and Type B is $5, the ratio of Type A to Type B can be found using the distances from the average.\n\nThe difference between Type B and the average is $5 - $4.20 = $0.80.\n\nThe difference between the average and Type A is $4.20 - $3 = $1.20.\n\nSo, the ratio of Type A to Type B is $0.80 : $1.20, which simplifies to 2:3.\n\nSo, for every 2 Type A widgets, there are 3 Type B widgets.\n\nTotal parts of the ratio are 2 + 3 = 5 parts.\n\nEach part represents 100 / 5 = 20 widgets.\n\nTherefore, Type A widgets are 2 * 20 = 40, and Type B widgets are 3 * 20 = 60.\n\nThis matches the earlier answer.\n\nAnother method could be to assume all widgets are Type A or all are Type B and then adjust based on the difference in profit.\n\nLet's assume all 100 widgets are Type A. Then the total profit would be 100 * $3 = $300.\n\nBut the actual profit is $420, which is $120 more than $300.\n\nSince each Type B widget brings in $2 more than Type A ($5 - $3 = $2), the number of Type B widgets is $120 / $2 = 60.\n\nThen, Type A widgets would be 100 - 60 = 40.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume all widgets are Type B, the total profit would be 100 * $5 = $500.\n\nBut the actual profit is $420, which is $80 less than $500.\n\nSince each Type A widget brings in $2 less than Type B ($3 - $5 = -$2), the number of Type A widgets is $80 / $2 = 40.\n\nThen, Type B widgets would be 100 - 40 = 60.\n\nSame result again.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 40 Type A widgets and 60 Type B widgets.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using matrices or something more advanced?\n\nWell, since it's a system of linear equations, I could represent it in matrix form.\n\nThe system is:\n\nx + y = 100\n\n3x + 5y = 420\n\nIn matrix form, that would be:\n\n[1 1 | 100]\n\n[3 5 | 420]\n\nI could use matrix operations to solve for x and y.\n\nFirst, I can use row reduction.\n\nStart with:\n\nRow1: 1 1 | 100\n\nRow2: 3 5 | 420\n\nI can eliminate x from Row2 by subtracting 3 times Row1 from Row2.\n\nRow2 - 3*Row1:\n\n(3 - 3*1) = 0\n\n(5 - 3*1) = 2\n\n(420 - 3*100) = 120\n\nSo, new Row2: 0 2 | 120\n\nNow, the system is:\n\nx + y = 100\n\n0x + 2y = 120\n\nDivide Row2 by 2:\n\n0x + y = 60\n\nSo, y = 60\n\nSubstitute back into Row1:\n\nx + 60 = 100\n\nx = 40\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis is getting interesting. It seems like no matter which method I use, I end up with 40 Type A widgets and 60 Type B widgets.\n\nMaybe I can try graphing the equations to visualize the solution.\n\nEquation 1: x + y = 100\n\nThis is a straight line with intercepts at (100,0) and (0,100).\n\nEquation 2: 3x + 5y = 420\n\nLet's find the intercepts for this line.\n\nIf x=0:\n\n3(0) + 5y = 420\n\n5y = 420\n\ny = 84\n\nSo, one point is (0,84)\n\nIf y=0:\n\n3x + 5(0) = 420\n\n3x = 420\n\nx = 140\n\nSo, another point is (140,0)\n\nBut wait, x + y = 100, so x and y must add up to 100. If I plot these lines, they should intersect at the point (40,60), which matches our earlier solution.\n\nGraphically, the intersection point of these two lines would be the solution to the system of equations.\n\nAnother thought: since both x and y represent numbers of widgets sold, they must be non-negative integers. So, x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0, and x and y must be whole numbers because you can't sell a fraction of a widget.\n\nIn this case, x = 40 and y = 60 satisfy these conditions.\n\nIs there any possibility of different solutions if we consider different constraints? For example, if there were minimum or maximum limits on the number of each type of widget sold.\n\nIn this problem, there don't seem to be any additional constraints, so the solution is straightforward.\n\nBut just to explore, suppose there was a maximum of 50 Type A widgets that could be sold. Then, if x cannot exceed 50, but in this case, x = 40, which is within the limit.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a minimum profit requirement per type, but again, in this problem, there are no such constraints.\n\nSo, based on the given information, the store sold 40 Type A widgets and 60 Type B widgets.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ Type A widgets and } 60 \\text{ Type B widgets}} \\]"
