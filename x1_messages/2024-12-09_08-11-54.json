        "content": "To calculate the total revenue for the month, we need to find out how much money the company made from selling both products X and Y. Revenue is basically the total income generated from sales before any expenses are deducted. It's calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit for each product, and then summing up the revenues from all products.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from product X:\n\nNumber of units sold for product X: 1500 units\n\nPrice per unit for product X: $30\n\nRevenue from product X = Number of units sold for X * Price per unit for X\n\nRevenue from product X = 1500 units * $30/unit\n\nRevenue from product X = $45,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from product Y:\n\nNumber of units sold for product Y: 1200 units\n\nPrice per unit for product Y: $40\n\nRevenue from product Y = Number of units sold for Y * Price per unit for Y\n\nRevenue from product Y = 1200 units * $40/unit\n\nRevenue from product Y = $48,000\n\nNow, to find the total revenue for the month, we add the revenues from both products:\n\nTotal revenue = Revenue from product X + Revenue from product Y\n\nTotal revenue = $45,000 + $48,000\n\nTotal revenue = $93,000\n\nTherefore, the company's total revenue for that month was $93,000.\n\n**Summary of steps:**\n\n1. Calculate revenue from product X by multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit.\n\n2. Calculate revenue from product Y by multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit.\n\n3. Add the revenues from product X and product Y to get the total revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{93000} \\]"
