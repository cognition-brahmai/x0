        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that takes an input string, reverses it, and then prints out both the reversed string and its length. Sounds straightforward enough. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to get an input from the user. In Python, I can use the `input()` function for that. So, I'll prompt the user to enter a string. Maybe something like \"Enter a string: \".\n\nOnce I have the string, I need to reverse it. There are a few ways to reverse a string in Python. One common way is to use slicing. If I have a string `s`, I can reverse it by doing `s[::-1]`. This should work nicely.\n\nAfter reversing the string, I need to print both the reversed string and its length. I can use the `print()` function for this, and also the `len()` function to get the length of the string.\n\nLet me sketch this out step by step:\n\n1. Prompt the user to enter a string.\n\n2. Take the input string.\n\n3. Reverse the string using slicing.\n\n4. Print the reversed string.\n\n5. Print the length of the reversed string.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like if the user enters an empty string or a string with only spaces. But for now, I'll keep it simple.\n\nLet me try writing some pseudocode:\n\n```\n\nget input from user\n\nreverse the input string\n\nprint the reversed string\n\nprint the length of the reversed string\n\n```\n\nThat seems pretty straightforward. Now, let's translate this into actual Python code.\n\nFirst, the input prompt:\n\n```\n\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n\n```\n\nThen, reverse the string:\n\n```\n\nreversed_string = input_string[::-1]\n\n```\n\nNow, print the reversed string:\n\n```\n\nprint(\"Reversed string:\", reversed_string)\n\n```\n\nAnd finally, print its length:\n\n```\n\nprint(\"Length of reversed string:\", len(reversed_string))\n\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the script would look like this:\n\n```\n\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n\nreversed_string = input_string[::-1]\n\nprint(\"Reversed string:\", reversed_string)\n\nprint(\"Length of reversed string:\", len(reversed_string))\n\n```\n\nLet me test this in my mind. If the user enters \"hello\", the reversed string should be \"olleh\", and its length is 5. Seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, I should consider whether the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string. Since reversing doesn't change the number of characters, the length should remain the same. But it's good to confirm.\n\nLet me think about other ways to reverse a string in Python. Another method could be using a loop to build the reversed string, or using the `reversed()` function combined with `join()`. For example:\n\n```\n\nreversed_string = ''.join(reversed(input_string))\n\n```\n\nThis should also work. But slicing is more concise and efficient in Python, so I'll stick with that.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe handling different types of characters, like punctuation or numbers. But since the task is just to reverse the string, it should handle any characters appropriately.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that leading or trailing spaces are handled correctly when reversing. For example, if the user enters \" hello \", reversing it should keep the spaces in place.\n\nLet me test this with some sample inputs:\n\n- Input: \"hello\"\n\n- Reversed: \"olleh\"\n\n- Length: 5\n\n- Input: \"abc 123\"\n\n- Reversed: \"321 cba\"\n\n- Length: 7\n\n- Input: \"a\"\n\n- Reversed: \"a\"\n\n- Length: 1\n\n- Input: \"\"\n\n- Reversed: \"\"\n\n- Length: 0\n\n- Input: \"   \"\n\n- Reversed: \"   \"\n\n- Length: 3\n\nSeems like it handles all these cases correctly.\n\nI should also think about whether I need to handle multi-line strings or very long strings. But since the task is to reverse a single string, it should work regardless of the string's length or whether it contains newlines.\n\nOne thing to note is that in Python, strings are immutable, so reversing doesn't affect the original string. That's good, because I don't want to modify the original input.\n\nI think this script meets the requirements. It's simple, concise, and should work for any input string.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll write it out again:\n\n```\n\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n\nreversed_string = input_string[::-1]\n\nprint(\"Reversed string:\", reversed_string)\n\nprint(\"Length of reversed string:\", len(reversed_string))\n\n```\n\nYes, that should do it. I can save this as a Python script, say, `reverse_string.py`, and run it to test with different inputs.\n\nI think this is a solid solution for the task at hand.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python script that takes an input string, reverses it, and then prints out both the reversed string along with its length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Use the `input()` function to get a string from the user.\n2. **String Reversal**: Reverse the string using slicing (`[::-1]`).\n3. **Output Results**: Print the reversed string and its length using the `print()` and `len()` functions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Get input from the user\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n\n# Reverse the string\nreversed_string = input_string[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed string\nprint(\"Reversed string:\", reversed_string)\n\n# Print the length of the reversed string\nprint(\"Length of reversed string:\", len(reversed_string))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The `input(\"Enter a string: \")` function prompts the user to enter a string and stores it in the variable `input_string`.\n2. **String Reversal**: The slicing method `input_string[::-1]` is used to reverse the string. This is a efficient and concise way to reverse strings in Python.\n3. **Output Results**: \n   - `print(\"Reversed string:\", reversed_string)` displays the reversed string.\n   - `print(\"Length of reversed string:\", len(reversed_string))` displays the length of the reversed string. Note that the length remains the same as the original string since reversing does not change the number of characters."
