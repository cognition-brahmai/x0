The colors are created when charged particles from the sun enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with gases like oxygen and nitrogen. Depending on the type of gas and the altitude, different colors are produced. For example, oxygen can produce green and sometimes red colors, while nitrogen can produce blue or purple hues. It's like nature's own light show!"
