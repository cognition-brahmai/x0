        "content": "Let's see. So, the company spends 30% on salaries and 20% on rent, and then there's $350,000 left. I need to find out what the initial revenue was.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what percentage of the revenue is left after spending on salaries and rent. If they spend 30% on salaries and 20% on rent, that's a total of 50% spent. So, 100% - 50% = 50% remaining.\n\nNow, that remaining 50% is equal to $350,000. So, if 50% of the initial revenue is $350,000, I can set up an equation to find the initial revenue.\n\nLet's denote the initial revenue as R. Then, 50% of R is $350,000. In mathematical terms, that's 0.5 * R = $350,000.\n\nTo find R, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5.\n\nSo, R = $350,000 / 0.5.\n\nLet me calculate that. $350,000 divided by 0.5 is $700,000.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to check this?\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total expenditures and the remaining revenue.\n\nIf the company spends 30% on salaries and 20% on rent, that's a total of 50% of the revenue spent.\n\nSo, the remaining 50% is $350,000.\n\nSo, again, initial revenue R minus 50% of R is $350,000.\n\nThat is, R - 0.5R = $350,000.\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.5R = $350,000.\n\nSo, R = $350,000 / 0.5 = $700,000.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 50% of R is $350,000.\n\nSince 50% is half of 100%, $350,000 must be half of the initial revenue.\n\nSo, doubling $350,000 gives $700,000.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\nIf the initial revenue is $700,000, then 30% of that is 0.3 * $700,000 = $210,000 on salaries.\n\n20% on rent is 0.2 * $700,000 = $140,000.\n\nTotal spent is $210,000 + $140,000 = $350,000.\n\nSo, the remaining revenue is $700,000 - $350,000 = $350,000, which matches the given information.\n\nTherefore, the initial revenue was $700,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{700000} \\]"
