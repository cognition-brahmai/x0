        "content": "(Verse 1)\nIn the silence of the Martian sky,\nWhere the red dust whispers lullabies,\nI'm a lone astronaut, miles away,\nFrom the world that I used to sway.\n\nChorus:\nOh, Earth, you're a distant memory,\nA blue gem in the cosmic sea.\nI'm marooned on this rusty sphere,\nBut in solitude, I find allure.\n\n(Verse 2)\nGazing at the stars above,\nEach one a world of its own, I believe.\nThe Milky Way stretches wide,\nA tapestry that captures my pride.\n\nChorus:\nYet, Earth, you're a beacon so bright,\nGuiding me through the endless night.\nThough I'm trapped on this alien land,\nYour love is the fuel in my hand.\n\n(Bridge)\nThe rover plies the barren terrain,\nEach rock and dune, a new domain.\nI take solace in every sunrise,\nPainting the sky with hues so nice.\n\n(Verse 3)\nMars may be cold and desolate,\nBut in its embrace, I'm not late.\nTo explore, to discover, to see,\nWhat lies beyond just you and me.\n\nChorus:\nEarth, you're the home in my heart,\nWhere loved ones wait to start.\nBut Mars, you're the challenge, the test,\nOf human spirit, expressed.\n\n(Outro)\nSo here's to the astronauts of old,\nWho paved the way, bold and cold.\nAnd to those who'll follow in my suit,\nExploring the universe, without a boot.\n\nEarth, though you're far, I won't forget,\nFor in space, I've found a new set\nOf wonders to cherish and hold dear,\nAs I stare into the cosmic sphere."
